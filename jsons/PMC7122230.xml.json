            "text": "Farmed animals, also commonly referred to as livestock or domesticated animals, are those animals that are reared in an agricultural setting in order to produce various commodities \u2013 usually food (meat, organs, eggs, dairy products), and/or hair or wool. In some settings farmed animals are also used to supply labour, and the manure of domesticated animals is often used as fertilizer. Animals were probably first farmed, that is their breeding and living conditions controlled by their human owners, around 7000\u20138000 BC during the first transitions from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to more settled agricultural living. The physiologies, behaviours, lifecycles of farmed animals generally differ quite substantially from those characteristics of the equivalent wild animals, and this difference impacts the interactions of these farmed animals with their parasites. Farmed animals are exposed to different stresses than wild animals, are kept at different densities, and their lifecycles regulated to such an extent that a parasite-host interaction in a farmed animal may differ significantly from that in a wild animal. Additionally, for infections that are of significant clinical importance, farmers may implement control measures (including treatment or prophylaxis) that alter the infection dynamics. With respect to Cryptosporidium infection, for which a satisfactory chemotherapeutic cure or prophylaxis is not yet available, different species infect different species of farmed animal, and may or may not be of clinical relevance.",

            "text": "While cryptosporidiosis in farmed animals is of veterinary relevance, resulting in clinical morbidity, mortality, and associated production losses, the zoonotic nature of various Cryptosporidium species (see Table 4.1) means that public health may also be affected by infections in farmed animals. Infection may be direct, from animal to human, or indirect, via a transmission vehicle. A large number of small outbreaks associated with C. parvum in calves and in veterinarians or veterinary students that have been exposed to calf faeces are documented in the literature (e.g. Grinberg et al. 2011; Gait et al. 2008; Robertson et al. 2006). In addition, a number of outbreaks have been documented associated with children visiting \u2018petting farms\u2019 or similar venues, where interaction with young animals such as lambs or calves is encouraged. Less commonly, transmission between animals such as camels or alpacas and their carers has also been reported. Drinking water, and less often food, has been associated with transmission of Cryptosporidium infection from animals to human populations, with C. parvum from grazing cattle contaminating water supplies particularly implicated. The high densities of farmed animals in water catchment areas mean that implementation of catchment control measures, including preventing defecation into water courses, may have a significant effect on minimising the risk from this potential transmission pathway.",

            "text": "The first report on bovine cryptosporidiosis was published in 1971, when parasites were identified in an 8-month-old heifer with chronic diarrhoea (Panciera et al. 1971). Since then, Cryptosporidium infection in cattle has been documented in most countries worldwide. Four major Cryptosporidium species infect cattle: C. parvum, C. bovis, C. ryanae and C. andersoni (Table 4.2; Fayer et al. 2007; Feng et al. 2007; Sant\u00edn et al. 2004; Langkjaer et al. 2007). Cryptosporidium parvum has a broad host range and apparently has the ability to infect most mammals, including humans and cattle. In contrast, the other three species have almost exclusively been found in cattle. In addition to these four common species, sporadic natural infections with C. felis, C. hominis, C. scrofarum, C. serpentis, C. suis and C. suis-like genotype have been detected in cattle (Bornay-Llinares et al. 1999; Geurden et al. 2006; Langkjaer et al. 2007; Sant\u00edn et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005; Chen and Huang 2012). The extent to which these findings reflect true infections or accidental carriage, i.e. ingested oocysts that pass intact through the gastrointestinal tract, remains to be clarified. Cattle have also been experimentally infected with C. canis, but natural infection has not been reported (Fayer et al. 2001).\n",

Infected animals have been reported from all age groups but infection is most common in preweaned calves. When calves up to 2 months of age have been investigated in point prevalence surveys, 5\u201393 % of the calves shed oocysts (Table 4.2; Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006; Sant\u00edn et al. 2004; Uga et al. 2000). Longitudinal studies performed in infected dairy herds showed that all calves in such herds shed oocysts at some time during their first months of life (O\u2019Handley et al. 1999; Sant\u00edn et al. 2008).",

            "text": "Molecular studies have revealed different genetic subtypes within the C. parvum and C. hominis species and DNA sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein gene is commonly used to further characterize the isolates. A number of C. parvum GP60 subtype families, designated IIa-IIo, have been described. Of these, IIc and IIe are considered anthroponotic, whereas IIa and IId are commonly found in both humans and animals. The other subtype families are uncommon and their zoonotic potential has not been determined. In cattle, C. parvum of the IIa subtype family is especially common. In addition to IIa, IId and occasionally IIl (sometimes named IIj) subtypes are found (Table 4.3; Xiao 2010). Whether there is a difference in pathogenicity between subtypes is currently unknown, as most genotyping studies to date have focused on herds with a history of calf diarrhoea. It has been suggested that herd management strategies affect subtype distribution. Studies from areas with closed herd management (limited animal movements between herds) have shown a high number of subtypes in the calf population, but only one subtype in each herd (Brook et al. 2009; Mi\u0161ic and Abe 2007; Soba and Logar 2008; Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2013). It has also been shown that a unique GP60 subtype can persist over time in a closed dairy herd (Bj\u00f6rkman and Mattsson 2006). In contrast, only a few subtypes have been identified in areas with more animal movements between herds, but several subtypes could be present in a herd (Brook et al. 2009; Peng et al. 2003; Trotz-Williams et al. 2006).\n",

(2005) used molecular tools to characterize Cryptosporidium oocysts from an asymptomatic neonatal calf in a dairy buffalo farm in Spain. Sequence analysis of a fragment of the oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene revealed that the isolate was closely related to the Cryptosporidium \u2018pig\u2019 genotype. A few years later, C. parvum was identified in water buffalo calves from Italy (Cacci\u00f2 et al. 2007) and today C. ryanae, C. bovis and C. ubiquitum have also been reported (Table 4.4). Most molecular investigations have been done in calves and thus it is not known if the species distribution differs between animals of different age. One of the few studies that include faecal samples from both calves and older animals was done in Egyptian smallholder herds (Helmy et al. 2013). C. parvum was most common in calves younger than 3 months but was detected in animals up to 2 years of age. In another study, also from Egypt but from another part of the country, C. parvum was only found in calves, whereas none of the sampled cows shed any Cryptosporidium oocysts (Amer et al. 2013). When the C. parvum isolates were subtyped by sequence analysis of the GP60 gene, subtype families IId and IIa were found, with a majority of IId in both studies. Subtype IId is the dominating subtype family also in cattle in Egypt (Amer et al. 2010; Helmy et al. 2013).",

            "text": "\nCryptosporidium parvum and C. andersoni are the two species that have been associated with clinical disease in cattle. C. parvum infection is considered a major cause of diarrhoea in young calves (Blanchard 2012; Radostits et al. 2007). Calves are often already infected during the first week of life (Uga et al. 2000) and clinical cryptosporidiosis is mostly seen in calves up to 6 weeks of age. The most prominent finding is pasty to watery diarrhoea, sometimes accompanied by lethargy, inappetence, fever, dehydration and/or poor condition. The calf most often recovers spontaneously within 1\u20132 weeks, but there is a large variation between individuals in how they respond to, and recover from, infection. In some cases the infection may be fatal (Tzipori et al. 1983; Fayer et al. 1998). A decrease in growth rate may be seen in the weeks after the calves have recovered from the acute phase of the disease (Klein et al. 2008), but no long-term effects on growth and performance have been reported. The pathogenesis of bovine cryptosporidiosis is not fully understood but the clinical signs are attributed to both malabsorption and an increase in fluid secretion in the ileum and proximal portions of the large intestine. For references and a brief overview see O\u2019Handley and Olson (2006). Cryptosporidiosis may be seen in individual calves, but frequently it soon develops among the calves into a herd problem. Concomitant infection with other pathogens, e.g. rotavirus, coronavirus and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli F5+) can worsen the clinical signs and prolong the duration of illness (Blanchard 2012).",

More recent investigations, applying molecular methods to analyse faecal samples from diarrhoeic calves, corroborate these earlier findings. When samples from young calves with diarrhoea were analysed, C. parvum is found to be the dominant species (Qu\u00edlez et al. 2008b; Imre et al. 2011; Karanis et al. 2010; Soba and Logar 2008; Plutzer and Karanis 2007). Interestingly, this dominance of C. parvum in diarrheic calves was also seen in a recent Swedish investigation of diarrheic calves (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2013), although C. bovis is the predominant species in randomly selected calves in Sweden.",

This resulted in subclinical infection in 2 of 3 calves. Both animals had, however, previously been infected with C. parvum and cross-protective immunity could not be excluded. Calves with diarrhoea are significantly more likely to be infected with C. parvum than with C. bovis (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2013; Starkey et al. 2006; Kv\u00e1\u010d et al. 2011). Based on these findings, and based on the fact that C. bovis is not common in calves, but is a widespread subclinical infection in older animals in most countries, C. bovis is commonly considered to be apathogenic to cattle. However, the pathogenic potential deserves further attention as high numbers of C. bovis oocysts in samples from diarrhoeic calves have been reported, even in the absence of C. parvum or other diarrhoeal agents (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2010a, b, 2013).",

Preventive hygiene measures and good management are currently the most important tools to control cryptosporidiosis. Reducing the number of oocysts ingested by neonatal calves may reduce the severity of infection and allow immunity to develop. A common recommendation is to ensure good hygiene in calf facilities and ascertain that all newborn calves ingest an adequate amount of colostrum during their first 24 h of life. Sick calves should be housed in a clean, warm, and dry environment and isolated to prevent spreading of the infection to other calves. Acutely infected animals may need supportive care with fluid and electrolytes, and milk should be given in small quantities several times daily to optimise digestion and minimise weight loss.",

Calves 36\u201348 h of age were challenged once with C. parvum oocysts and were simultaneously administered the antibody-biocide fusion mixed with milk replacer. The antibody-biocide fusion treatment was repeated 5\u20138 times. Control calves were given milk replacer with placebo. Calves receiving the antibody-biocide fusion had a significantly higher health score and shed fewer oocysts than control calves.

However, it takes weeks for a protective immune response to develop after a vaccine has been administered, and as calves may be exposed to Cryptosporidium oocysts immediately after birth, vaccination of newborn calves is unlikely to be successful in preventing cryptosporidiosis. Thus it has been suggested that the most feasible approach is likely to involve passive immunisation (Innes et al. 2011). Dams are immunised in late gestation and their colostrum is fed to the calves. A recent study investigated antibody responses in calves fed colostrum from heifers vaccinated with a recombinant C. parvum oocyst surface protein (rCP15/60). The calves had measurable quantities of the specific antibody in their serum. However, as the calves were not subsequently challenged with oocysts it remains to be seen whether this immunisation scheme can also prevent symptomatic infection and eliminate oocyst shedding (Burton et al. 2011).",

During the first 2 weeks an infected calf can shed millions of oocysts (Fayer et al. 1998; Uga et al. 2000) resulting in heavy environmental contamination, and efficient dissemination of the parasite within the herd and to the environment. In faecal samples obtained from symptomatic calves naturally infected with C. parvum 106\u2013108 oocysts per gram faeces (OPG) are often seen (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2013). In herds with established C. parvum infection, most calves are excreting oocysts between 2 and 4 weeks of age (O\u2019Handley et al. 1999; Sant\u00edn et al. 2008; Uga et al. 2000). When Sant\u00edn et al. (2008) repeatedly sampled the same 30 calves in a dairy herd from birth to 2 years of age they found C. parvum oocysts in faeces of all individuals before they were 3 weeks old, i.e. a cumulative prevalence of 100 %. C. parvum oocysts were also found in samples collected from a calf at 16 weeks of age and from another at 6 months of age, indicating that oocysts can be shed intermittently over a long period after the initial infection. Alternatively, these late-shedding individuals might not have developed a fully protective immunity after the first infection, and rather than this being a sign of prolonged infection, they had acquired new infections. In this study, molecular analyses indicated the same sub-genotype at the GP60 locus. However, this does not necessarily indicate prolonged infection, as re-infection with the same genotype in the environment may occur if the immunity is not protective. It has been suggested that an increase in C. parvum oocyst shedding may occur in adult cows around calving (so called periparturient rise), but to date there have been few reports to support this. In a recent study, however, dams in a suckler beef herd were found to shed low levels of C. parvum oocysts around the time of calving (De Waele et al. 2012).",

This is also the age group that is most often infected with C. parvum and suffers from clinical cryptosporidiosis. Thus, from clinical and zoonotic perspective, knowledge on the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in young calves is highly valuable. When potential risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection in pre-weaned calves have been explored, the results differ between studies. One factor that recurs in several studies is the type of flooring in the calf housing area. In Spain, Castro-Hermida et al. (2002) found that straw on the floor or earth floors in the calf pens increased the risk for infection compared with cement flooring, and in Malaysia calves kept in pens with slatted floors and sand floors had an increased risk compared with those in pens with cement floors (Muhid et al. 2011). A protective effect of cement floors was also reported from the USA (Trotz-Williams et al. 2008). It was suggested that the reason for this protective effect of cement floors is that they facilitate thorough cleaning. This assumption corroborates the finding that a low frequency of cleaning of the calf pens increased the risk for infection (Castro-Hermida et al. 2002). It is also consistent with the finding that the use of an empty period in the calf pen between introductions of calves was associated with a lower risk for infection in Danish dairy herds (Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006). When cows as a cause of infection were investigated, a higher risk of infection was identified in calves that were housed separately from their dams (Duranti et al. 2009), and a lower risk of infection in dairy calves kept with the cow for more than 6 h after birth (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2009b).",

These have often involved veterinary students and students at farm schools (see, e.g., Gait et al. 2008; Grinberg et al. 2011; Pohjola et al. 1986; Robertson et al. 2006; Kiang et al. 2006), but also young children have fallen ill after visiting petting zoos or open farms (Gormley et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2004). Contact with cattle has been identified as a risk factor for disease also in case-control studies of sporadic human cryptosporidiosis (Hunter et al. 2004; Robertson et al. 2002; Roy et al. 2004). Altogether, there is plenty of evidence to conclude that Cryptosporidium can be transmitted from calves to humans by direct contact or by contaminated equipment. The risk for zoonotic transmission is likely to be highest in herds with Cryptosporidium associated calf diarrhoeal problems, where oocyst contamination in the barn can reach high levels and where contact with na\u00efve individuals is most likely to occur. Key measures to prevent visitors becoming infected are to ensure good hygiene in the visitor area, providing suitable hand-washing facilities and ensure that they are used when workers and visitors leave the premises. C. bovis infections have recently been detected in a few persons living or working on cattle farms (Khan et al. 2010; Ng et al. 2012). It is not known if these were active infections and the implication of these findings is thus unclear.",

            "text": "As molecular typing methods become more accessible, epidemiological studies can investigate C. parvum GP60 subtype distribution in cattle and human populations in different regions. The reports so far indicate that in many areas the subtypes that are most common in cattle are those most often found in humans. For example, C. parvum IIaA15G2R1 was the predominant subtype in both bovine and human infections in Slovenia and Portugal (Soba and Logar 2008; Alves et al. 2006). In New South Wales, Australia C. parvum IIaA18G3R1 dominated in both calves and people living on cattle farms (Ng et al. 2012), whereas IIaA16G2R1 was the predominant genotype identified in beef cattle and humans in Prince Edward Island, Canada (Budu-Amoako et al. 2012c). Further information is provided in the review by Xiao (2010). That the same subtypes are found in cattle and humans might be taken as an indication of zoonotic transmission. However, it is important to note that even when zoonotic C. parvum subtypes are identified in humans, cattle are not necessarily the source of the infection. These zoonotic subtypes can circulate and propagate in the human population in addition to the anthroponotic subtypes. The occasional finding of C. hominis (Smith et al. 2005; Chen and Huang 2012) in cattle highlights the fact that cryptosporidiosis may be transmitted not only from cattle to humans, but also from humans to cattle.",

Grazing cattle or slaughterhouse effluent contaminating Lake Michigan were mentioned as two possible sources of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the large outbreak in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1993 (Mac Kenzie et al 1994), but retrospective analysis of clinical isolates revealed that it was caused by the anthroponotic species C. hominis (Sulaiman et al. 1998). This was also the case in the most recent outbreaks in UK (compiled by Chalmers 2012) and a large drinking waterborne outbreak in Sweden in 2010 (Anonymous 2011). Given that pre-weaned calves are the most likely age group to shed C. parvum oocysts, any measure to prevent waterborne zoonotic transmission should be directed towards this age group. Protective measures could be to prevent young ruminants from accessing water catchments, and compost or spread calf manure on fields where runoff cannot occur. The manure of older ruminants is generally not a zoonotic concern with respect to Cryptosporidium.",

            "text": "As for other animals, ovine and caprine Cryptosporidium infection can be found throughout the world. The prevalence varies widely between studies, from 0 % to 77 % in sheep and from 0 % to 100 % in goats. All age groups are susceptible, but infection is more common in lambs and kids than in older animals (Tables 4.5 and 4.6). Study design factors other than age of sampled animals, such as whether only diarrhoeal animals were sampled or not, if a point prevalence study or a longitudinal study was performed and the diagnostic method(s) used, also can affect prevalence data. The effect of using different diagnostic methods is evident in, for example, Giadinis et al. (2012; see also Tables 4.5 and 4.6) and Ryan et al. (2005), where microscopy resulted in lower prevalences than detected by ELISA and PCR, respectively. Prevalence and species distribution for studies conducted on sheep dating back to 2007 are summarised in Table 4.5. Specific data for studies on sheep published before 2007 can be found in \u201cCryptosporidium and Cryptosporidiosis\u201d (Sant\u00edn and Trout 2008; Tables 18.9 and 18.10). Prevalence rates and species distribution for all identified surveys of goats are summarised in Table 4.6.\n\n",

            "text": "Several species and genotypes have been identified in sheep, and the species distribution varies between studies and with age of the animals. Cryptosporidium parvum, C. ubiquitum (previously Cryptosporidium cervine/cervid genotype) and C. xiaoi (previously C. bovis-like genotype) are the most common species. Sporadic infection with C. hominis, C. suis, C. andersoni, C. fayeri (previously marsupial genotype I), C. scrofarum (previously pig genotype II), sheep genotype I, and unknown/novel genotypes have been identified (Chalmers et al. 2005; Giles et al. 2009; Karanis et al. 2007; Ryan et al. 2005, 2008; Sweeny et al. 2011b; Wang et al. 2010c). Species distribution differs between studies and between age groups within studies. For instance, C. parvum is commonly found in lambs in Italy, Romania, Spain and the UK (D\u00edaz et al. 2010a; Imre et al. 2013; Mueller-Doblies et al. 2008; Paoletti et al. 2009). In other studies, C. ubiquitum or C. xiaoi is the most common species (Fiuza et al. 2011a; Geurden et al. 2008; Robertson et al. 2010; Sweeny et al. 2011b). For example, Wang et al. (2010c) identified C. ubiquitum in 90 % of all analysed samples, and the species dominated in all age groups, whereas Sweeny et al. (2011b) found C. xiaoi to be the most common species in lambs (73.1 %) and the only species in ewes (Table 4.5). Cryptosporidium bovis has also been reported in sheep (Mueller-Doblies et al. 2008; Soltane et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2010c). Whether C. bovis has actually been identified in sheep, or if it is the closely related species C. xiaoi is uncertain. For instance, Soltane et al. (2007) reported isolates similar to C. bovis, and Mueller-Doblies et al. (2008) reported C. bovis, but a BLAST search of the GenBank accession numbers identified these isolates as C. xiaoi. For the isolates reported as C. bovis by Yang et al. (2009), no GenBank accession numbers are available, so the true identity of those isolates is uncertain. Similarly, no GenBank records are available from the study of Ryan et al. (2005) reporting the \u201cNew bovine B genotype\u201d in sheep. Since C. bovis was first identified as the bovine B genotype, this could actually be the \u201cC. bovis-like genotype\u201d, i.e. C. xiaoi.",

In addition, one report of natural infection with C. hominis is also available (Giles et al. 2009). The identification of C. xiaoi in a number of samples is in contrast with a failed attempt to infect 36-week-old goats to determine the host range of C. xiaoi (Fayer and Sant\u00edn 2009). Because there is only scant information about cryptosporidiosis in goats, we do not know if an age-related resistance or immunity from a previous Cryptosporidium infection could have affected this experiment, as natural infections indicate that C. xiaoi is infectious to goats.",

The patent period can last for at least 13 days (Paraud et al. 2010). Shedding peaks a few days to a week into the patent period, and maximum shedding can be as high as 2 \u00d7 107 OPG (Rieux et al. 2013). The length of the patent period and shedding intensity are determined by age, immune status and infection dose (de Graaf et al. 1999). A natural age-related resistance to infection seems to be present. In one study, the prepatent period increased and intensity of shedding decreased in lambs with increasing age at infection (Ortega-Mora and Wright 1994). In another study, one naturally infected group of goat kids started shedding at 17 days of age and excretion peaked at a mean of 23 \u00d7 104 OPG 5\u201311 days later (Rieux et al. 2013), whereas another group of animals studied by the same authors started shedding at the age of 10 days, with a mean peak of 3 \u00d7 106 OPG 0\u20134 days later, indicating higher virulence, infection pressure or an age-related higher sensitivity in the latter group.",

            "text": "The significance of sheep and goats as reservoirs for zoonotic cryptosporidiosis is unclear (Robertson 2009). The first case of suspected zoonotic transmission from sheep was described in 1989 (Casemore 1989), but at that time diagnosis was based solely on microscopy and thus zoonotic transmission cannot be confirmed. However, since the introduction of molecular tools in diagnostics, a number of cases and outbreaks with suspected or confirmed zoonotic transfer from sheep have been described (Cacci\u00f2 et al. 2013; Gormley et al. 2011). In the UK, where sheep farming is an important industry, a seasonal pattern with spring and autumn peaks of human cryptosporidiosis cases is observed, with the spring peak concurring with the lambing season (Anonymous 2002; Gormley et al. 2011; McLauchlin et al. 2000; Nichols et al. 2006). Lambs in petting zoos seem to be a common infection source (Chalmers et al. 2005; Elwin et al. 2001; Gormley et al. 2011; Pritchard et al. 2007). The incidence of human cryptosporidiosis, especially due to C. parvum, dropped significantly during the foot-and-mouth outbreak in the spring and summer 2001 (Hunter et al. 2003) when >6 million livestock animals (~4.9 million sheep; Anonymous 2001) were slaughtered and there were restrictions in animal movements and farm visits, providing further evidence of the importance of zoonotic transmission in this region.",

Several studies using multi-locus genotyping (MLG) have found evidence of specific host associated C. parvum populations (Drumo et al. 2012; Mallon et al. 2003a, b; Morrison et al. 2008). In the United Kingdom, sheep MLGs clustered with human and bovine isolates (Mallon et al. 2003a, b), indicating frequent zoonotic transmission, whereas only one of the 34 MLGs identified in sheep/goats in Italy was also identified in human samples (Drumo et al. 2012), indicating a low rate of zoonotic transmission. However, the latter study included very few human isolates.",

In Scotland, C. ubiquitum was the third most common species in raw water and the most common species identified in drinking water (Nichols et al. 2010). Thus, in areas where C. ubiquitum is common in sheep and goats, this species could be a more important cause of zoonotic infection than C. parvum. In addition, the relatively common presence of this species in water indicates a potential for waterborne outbreaks.",

Subsequent use of molecular methods provided the necessary tools to identify and distinguish species.\n",

Some surveys have studied individual pigs at various ages, or only those pigs with diarrhoea, or simply specimens submitted to diagnostic laboratories from unspecified locations (Table 4.8). Even in comparable populations, such as preweaned pigs in the same country or indifferent countries, data differences are too great to draw any conclusions on prevalence. For example: in Australia- reports of 32.7 % versus 6.0 % prevalence (Johnston et al. 2008 vs. Ryan et al. 2003a); in the Czech Republic- reports of 21.8 % versus 5.7 % prevalence (Kv\u00e1\u010d et al. 2009a vs. Vitovec et al. 2006); or between Serbia and Spain \u2013 reports of 32 versus 0 % prevalence (Mi\u0161i\u0107 et al. 2003 vs. Qu\u00edlez et al. 1996a). Some studies found significant association between the presence of a particular species and the pigs\u2019 age, with C. suis prominent in piglets and C. scrofarum prominent in weaners (Enemark et al. 2003). In contrast, others found no significant association between species and age or housing conditions (Featherstone et al. 2010b). These prevalence data reflect vast differences in management practices from location to location with too many unknown factors to draw valid conclusions on cause and effect or location within the 49 cited studies in Table 4.8 that reported a prevalence of infection between 0.1 % and 100 %. The only variable repeatedly associated with detection of Cryptosporidium is age. Most positive samples were from weaners and growers (Table 4.8). Generally, prevalence increased until pigs were 10 weeks of age, then gradually declined.",

Cryptosporidium was detected histologically in the microvillus brush border of 5.3 % of 3,491 pigs from 133 farms examined for routine diagnostic evaluation (Sanford 1987). Most infected pigs were 6\u201312 weeks old. Organisms were detected in the jejunum, ileum, caecum, and colon, but primarily in microvilli of dome epithelium in the ileum. Twenty six percent of Cryptosporidium-infected pigs had diarrhoea but most of these also had other primary agents capable of causing diarrhoea. Similar observations have been made by others. Whereas most infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild, non-specific colitis (Higgins 1999), pigs known to be naturally infected with C. suis or C. scrofarum have not been found with clinical signs of infection while pigs infected with C. parvum or co-infected other enteropathogens such as rotavirus, Salmonella, or Isospora have had associated diarrhoea and some have died (Enemark et al. 2003; N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. 2003; Hamnes et al. 2007).",

Experimental infection with the avian species, C. meleagridis, obtained from a human infection, consistently resulted in oocyst excretion and diarrhoea in pigs, although mucosal changes were milder than those described for C. parvum (Akiyoshi et al. 2003). Piglets infected with C. suis had mild or no clinical signs despite excreting large numbers of oocysts, in contrast to those infected with C. parvum that had diarrhoea for a mean duration of 3.5 days and developed inappetence, depression and vomiting (Enemark et al. 2003).",

In the first days of infection more stages were found in the proximal intestine, but later more stages were found in distal locations (Tzipori et al. 1982; Vitovec and Koudela 1992). Extra-intestinal infections also have been reported in pigs. In two naturally infected piglets, the gall bladder was infected (Fleta et al. 1995). In experimentally immunosuppressed piglets, the gall bladder, bile ducts, and pancreatic ducts were found infected (Healey et al. 1997).

Hamnes et al. (2007) reported C. suis and C. scrofarum in faeces of suckling pigs in Norway and reasoned that farrowing operations were sources of these parasites. Additional data on oocyst concentrations, numbers of oocysts excreted, how long oocysts remain infectious under environmental condition, and modes of transmission of Cryptosporidium species and genotypes are rare or non-existent. A year-long investigation was conducted at four types of swine operations (finishing, farrowing, nursery and gestation) in Georgia, USA (Jenkins et al. 2010). Mean oocyst concentrations ranged from 11 to 354 oocysts per ml of lagoon effluent; the nursery had the highest concentration of oocysts and the greatest percentage of viable oocysts (24.2 %), C. suis and C. scrofarum were the dominant species with some C. muris and C. parvum. Experimental attempts to transmit C. scrofarum to adult SCID mice, adult BALB/c mice, Mongolian gerbils, southern multimammate mice, yellow-necked mice, and guinea pigs were unsuccessful, suggesting that rodents are an unlikely source of transmission of this species under natural conditions (Kv\u00e1\u010d et al. 2013).",

While these studies on free-ranging cervids may give useful information regarding the species or genotype of Cryptosporidium that might infect farmed deer (C. ubiquitum, C. parvum), as farmed deer probably differ quite substantially from their wild counterparts regarding exposures and stresses, extrapolation of prevalence data from wild to farmed deer may give an incorrect picture. Indeed, a study in Poland found that the prevalence of Cryptosporidium was significantly higher in wild red deer than farmed red deer (27 % compared with 4.5 %), and mean oocyst concentration was also five times higher in faecal samples from wild red deer (Paziewska et al 2007). However as the sample size was relatively small (52 wild deer, 66 farmed deer) and from only single locations and as age and symptoms were not indicated, it is not possible to determine the reason for these differences.",

Some of the first published studies on Cryptosporidium infection in cervids are case reports of severe (high mortality) outbreaks among farmed red deer calves. In one outbreak in Scotland, UK among 82 artificially reared red deer calves, 56 developed cryptosporidiosis and 20 subsequently died; 80 % of the calves with diarrhoea and 50 % of apparently asymptomatic calves excreted oocysts and post mortem histopathological examination of the intestines demonstrated lesions similar to those seen in other species (Tzipori et al. 1981a). Another outbreak among new-born red deer calves in the UK also resulted in high mortality, with calves dying at 24\u201372 h of age. However, this outbreak was not characterized by diarrhoea, and terminal uraemia was proposed as the symptom leading to death (Simpson 1992). Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in red deer calves have also been reported from New Zealand, again with relatively high mortality (10 out of 10 calves dying within a few days of illness onset in one outbreak, and 7 out of 10 calves dying within 3 days of illness in another outbreak) (Orr et al. 1985). Severe subactute enteritis in the small and large intestine were reported in both outbreaks.",

The authors speculate that this may be related to hormonal or immunological changes, or perhaps alterations in stress levels. The authors note that this preparturient rise in oocyst shedding results in contamination of the environment for the new born calves. However, in this study, although calves became infected, oocyst excretion was low (not exceeding 150 OPG, and usually less), and clinical disease was not observed.

However, in California none of 354 llamas from 33 facilities were found positive (Rulofson et al. 2001) nor were 61 alpacas on two farms in Maryland (Trout et al. 2008). Elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Australia small numbers of alpacas, llamas and guanacos have been examined and a few have been found positive for Cryptosporidium (Table 4.11). Most examinations were conducted by microscopy, but those that utilized molecular methods identified only C. parvum (Morgan et al. 1998; Starkey et al. 2007; O\u2019Brien et al. 2008; Twomey et al. 2008). The exception is a study in which a cria was found infected with C. ubiquitum (Gomez-Couso et al. 2012). A national survey of 5,163 1\u201315-day-old alpacas in 105 Andean herds in Peru, the natural habitat for nearly 80 % of the world\u2019s alpacas, found 2 % of the youngest alpacas increasing to 20 % of the oldest alpacas, infected with Cryptosporidium spp., with an overall prevalence of 13 % (Lopez-Urbina et al. 2009). More recently in Peru, 4.4 % of 274 alpacas from 12 herds were found positive for Cryptosporidium spp. (Gomez-Couso et al. 2012). Herd prevalence was 58.3 % (7/12 herds) for Cryptosporidium. The highest prevalence (20 %) was found in the 8-week-old group (Gomez-Couso et al. 2012).\n",

However, even asymptomatic infection may result in some pathology, as noted by Inman and Takeuchi (1979), who reported blunted villi, a decrease in villus-crypt ratio, and mild oedema in the lamina propria in an apparently asymptomatic adult rabbit.

It was stated that macroscopic post mortem examination of the infraorbital sinuses of healthy birds was normal compared with those of diseased birds, but it was not clearly stated whether Cryptosporidium sp. was also identified in the healthy birds and thus the infection prevalence cannot be estimated. Goodwin et al (1988b) identified invasive Cryptosporidium stages in turkey poults form a farm where the poults suffered from self-limiting diarrheal of unknown aetiology, but no prevalence estimation was given. Prevalences of 80 % in 17-day-old poults, 38 % in 24-day-old and 0 % in \u226560-day-old poults was found by Woodmansee et al. (1988). Oocysts were identified as C. meleagridis based on morphology and infection site. A 35.5 % (17/60) prevalence in diarrhoeic or just unthrifty poults was reported in Iran (Gharagozlou et al. 2006). Prevalence was based on histological examination of intestinal, bursal and cloacal tissues. Examination of faeces revealed that only 29 % of the infected birds shed oocysts. Infection was identified in 1\u20137-week-old poults, whereas the 43 uninfected poults all were older than 7 weeks.

One of 59 turkeys was positive at post-slaughter examination (age 14 weeks). Upon DNA analysis, all six positive samples were identified as C. parvum.

In 1994, Gajadhar et al. characterized the isolated oocysts and investigated host specificity. The oocysts were morphologically similar to those of C. meleagridis, but attempts to infect suckling mice, chickens, turkeys and quail failed, indicating that this was probably another species. In addition, only faecal samples were investigated, so the infection site was not determined (Gajadhar 1994).

Oocysts were of two sizes, 3.8 \u00d7 3.8 \u03bcm and 5.7 \u00d7 4.8 \u03bcm, indicating the presence of two different species. In contrast, in a Spanish study a 60 % Cryptosporidium prevalence in adult rheas and ostriches was found (Ponce Gordo et al. 2002). The authors reported an oocyst diameter of 3\u20135 \u03bcm, which is similar to the description provided by Gajadhar (1994). Molecular analysis of the isolates was not performed. Oliveira et al. (2008) found 44 % prevalence in 77 ostriches based on microscopy. Oocysts were generally morphologically similar to C. baileyi and Cryptosporidium avian genotype II (Ryan and Xiao 2008). However, the morphometric variation was so large that the authors suggested that more than one species had been identified (Oliveira et al. 2008), but this was not verified by molecular analysis. An isolate similar to C. baileyi in both oocyst morphology and PCR-RFLP banding pattern was described from Brazilian ostriches (Santos et al. 2005). The isolate was characterized as a sister taxon to C. baileyi by sequence analysis of the 18S rDNA, HSP70 and actin genes (Meireles et al. 2006), and was named Cryptosporidium avian genotype II by another research group (Ng et al. 2006). Experimental infection (oral or intratracheal) with the Brazilian isolate in chickens failed (Meireles et al. 2006). The avian genotype II has also been identified in Vietnam. On a single ostrich farm 110 (23.7 %) of 464 samples were positive for Cryptosporidium oocysts. The highest prevalence as well as the highest shedding intensity (35.2 %) was found in 2\u20133 month-old animals. Of 17 samples used for molecular characterization, all were found to be avian genotype II (Nguyen et al. 2013).",

Early attempts at experimental infection of quail with C. baileyi isolated from chickens failed (Current et al. 1986; Lindsay et al. 1986), but were later successful (Cardozo et al. 2005). Natural infection was first documented in 2001 (Morgan et al. 2001). Since then, natural C. baileyi infection has been described in two reports (Murakami et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2012). One large survey of Cryptosporidium infection in quails was performed in China (Wang et al. 2012). Out of 1,818 faecal samples, 239 (13.1 %) from 29 (61.7 %) farms were positive. Infection was most common among 72\u2013100-day old quails (23.6 %). DNA analysis revealed C. baileyi in 237 samples and C. meleagridis in two samples. One case of Cryptosporidium infection in partridges was described (Pages-Mante et al. 2007).",

Cryptosporidium sp. and concurrent adenovirus infection was identified in a large broiler flock with respiratory disease (Dhillon et al. 1981). In a retrospective study on post mortem diagnoses of respiratory cryptosporidiosis, it was found that co-infection with virus or bacteria was common (Goodwin et al. 1988a). In another study, Cryptosporidium sp. and Aspergillus or bacteria were detected in the lungs of four layer chickens that died from pneumonia. Cryptosporidium were also found in the ureters and kidneys (Nakamura and Abe 1988). The effect of Cryptosporidium infection alone on development of clinical symptoms in these cases cannot be estimated, but there is probably a synergistic effect of co-infections, increasing the severity. Such a synergistic effect of co-infection with infectious bronchitis virus or Escherichia coli has been reported (Blagburn et al. 1991).",

Experimental infection (crop inoculation) with C. meleagridis produced infection of the ileum, caecum and bursa, but was not associated with clinical symptoms (Bermudez et al. 1988). The isolate used was from symptomatic poults; however, these were simultaneously infected with reovirus (causing enteritis and hepatitis). Co-infection with Cryptosporidium and reovirus in turkeys with enteritis and hepatitis, leading to increased mortality, has also been shown in another study (Wages and Ficken 1989). The presence of other pathogens in these studies could indicate a low to moderate primary pathogenicity of C. meleagridis. Self-limiting diarrhoea (moderate to severe in character), a slower growth rate and growth deformities were reported from one farm where diseased poults were diagnosed with Cryptosporidium infection (Goodwin et al. 1988b). Other pathogens were not excluded, as was also mentioned by the authors.",

Similarly, no symptoms occurred in geese in which Cryptosporidium infection was detected in the conjunctivas and bursas (Chvala et al. 2006); and Richter et al.

However, the authors did not associate the problems with the infection, since changed management practices decreased clinical symptoms and mortality, although Cryptosporidium infection was still present on the farm. Enteritis was indicated by the presence of intestinal invasive stages and rectal prolapse in one chick examined by Penrith and Burger (1993). Because diarrhoea was not reported it is unknown whether the prolapse was caused by intense bowel movements or something else.

Hoerr et al. (1986) reported high mortality rates from 5 days of age in quails infected with Cryptosporidium sp., and with no bacterial or viral pathogens detected. Acute fatal diarrhoea with mortality rates of up to 45 % in 0\u201317-day-old birds was described by Ritter et al (1986). Reovirus was also detected in necropsied birds, but another study reported that experimental infection with reovirus alone did not produce diarrhoea, whereas infection with Cryptosporidium sp., either alone or simultaneously with reovirus, resulted in severe diarrhoea and mortality (Guy et al. 1987). A synergistic effect of co-infection was, however, shown, since oocyst shedding was higher and reovirus infection became systemic and liver necrosis occurred (Guy et al. 1987).",

Co-infection of Cryptosporidium sp., Mycoplasma gallisepticum and other bacteria was shown. The authors concluded that M. gallisepticum was the primary pathogen, but that the mixed infections in conjunction with high ammonia concentrations in the air worsened the symptoms. The role of Cryptosporidium infection in respiratory disease in quails thus remains unclear. Wang et al.

This species is the third most common species in human cryptosporidiosis worldwide. In the industrialised world, C. meleagridis infection is usually associated with cryptosporidiosis cases in travellers to Asia or Africa (Elwin et al. 2012; Insulander et al. 2013; Leoni et al. 2006), but autochthonous cases have also been described (Elwin et al. 2012; Leoni et al. 2006; Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2012). Studies on Cryptosporidium prevalence and species distribution in humans in South America have identified C. meleagridis infection at about the same prevalence as C. parvum (Cama et al. 2003, 2007, 2008). Although this is a true zoonotic species, there is only one report in which the bird source has been identified, and in that case, chickens and not turkeys were involved (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2012). It is not known whether anthroponotic transmission occurs with this species, but it has been indicated by the fact that not all C. meleagridis-infected patients in an epidemiological investigation had had bird or animal contact (Elwin et al. 2012). C. meleagridis has the potential to infect other mammalian species as well, and experimental infection of mice, rats, rabbits, pigs and calves has been reported (Akiyoshi et al. 2003; Darabus and Olariu 2003). Due to the wide host range and the close relationship of C. meleagridis to C. parvum and C. hominis, it has been proposed that this species originated as a mammalian Cryptosporidium species, and later adapted to birds (Xiao et al. 2002b, 2004).",

However, only one of 59 birds post-slaughter was positive compared to 2.5\u201310.5 % of the 5\u201310-week younger poults, which means risk of transmission via contaminated meat should be very small. The higher prevalence in poults should not pose a risk as long as the flocks are closed to the public. The shedding intensity was not reported, but prevalence indicates that infection rather than just intestinal passage was present. Some studies have identified C. parvum, C. hominis and C. hominis-like isolates in Canada geese (Jellison et al. 2004, 2009; Zhou et al. 2004). The authors conclude that these findings are probably not associated with infection and parasite proliferation, but rather transient carriage. Nevertheless, this indicates that domesticated ducks and geese can potentially act as transmission vehicles for these species.",

Cryptosporidiosis was first identified as a disease of veterinary significance in the 1950s (in turkeys) and then in the early 1970s in calves, but major interest in cryptosporidiosis only developed with the first report of a human cases later that decade, and the recognition that Cryptosporidium infection was also of medical importance. Since then our knowledge on the veterinary significance of Cryptosporidium infection has expanded enormously \u2013 particularly in the livestock sector most impacted by cryptosporidiosis \u2013 young calves. However, as demonstrated in this chapter, it should not be forgotten almost all farmed animals may be pathologically affected by at least one species of Cryptosporidium, often causing clinical disease that in some instances may be fatal. For some Cryptosporidium species in some farmed animal species, transmission may be anthropozoonotic.",
