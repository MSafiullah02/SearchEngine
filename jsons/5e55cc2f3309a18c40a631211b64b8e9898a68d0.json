Conceptualised both as a process and a valued outcome, it is often viewed as a defining feature and a key principle of health promotion (Robertson & Minkler, 1994; Rootman, Goodstadt, Potvin & Springett, 2001) . Taking advantage of an undisputable position as a cardinal value, the role of participation has rarely been critically examined in relation to health promotion practice and its contribution to public health. The questions regarding the role of participation and how, in practice, practitioners can facilitate and support its emergence, have not been given satisfactory answers. Answers to these crucial questions can only result from a theoretical understanding of what participation entails in terms of action in the social situations of health promotion interventions. Theorizing on the role of participation in health promotion and on the social processes at play when it occurs is a prerequisite to reframing participation as a professional practice rather than as an ideology (see Pelikan, Chapter 6), and to develop appropriate procedures that can foster the conditions for effective participation.",

Firstly, identifying some of the reasons why the world in which we live is increasingly uncontrollable by scientific means (Giddens, 1990 (Giddens, , 1994 , this chapter will argue for the necessity of public health to develop a practice of participation as a strategy to manage the uncertainty associated with reflexivity, a characteristic of our contemporary society (see Balbo, Chapter 8). Secondly, expanding upon Callon's Actors Network Theory we will elaborate a theoretical conception of participation as a process by which groups of heterogeneous actors negotiate their role with regards to a social situation; in so doing these actors actively explore the possible worlds that can be collectively pursued.",

An exemplary endeavour of The Enlightenment, public health rests on the underlying assumption that the association of science and the State through expert knowledge and bureaucracy will yield to a world where disease and death, conceived as failures of nature, are no longer part of the human experience (Fassin, 1996) . \"Suffering, healing, and dying, which are essentially transitive activities that culture taught each man, are now claimed by technocracy as new areas of policy-making and are treated as malfunctions from which populations ought to be institutionally relieved\" (Illich, 1975, p. 132) . Although public health can certainly claim to have fulfilled a great deal of this command, its action also generated novel sanitary challenges.

In health however, as in many other applied sciences, the modernist utopia of creating an orderly world through the application of scientific knowledge has been achieved often at the cost of creating new risks or adverse outcomes. The new realities engineered through scientific and technological progress are also associated with unexpected and undesirable outcomes (Beck, 1992 (Beck, , 2000 Giddens, 1994) .

For Giddens, reflexivity primarily relates to the social practices involved in attempts to exercise control over aspects of our world, and how such practices continuously transform, and are transformed, by the knowledge they generate The fact that knowledge about the world is a part of the world blurs the relationship between knowing subjects and the objects of knowledge. Thus, knowledge gained about the world through science is constantly being reintroduced in society, participating to the latter's increasing complexity (see McQueen, Chapter 4). \"The reflexivity of modern social life consists in the fact that social practices are constantly examined and re-formed in light of incoming information about those very practices, thus constitutively altering their character\" (Giddens, 1990, p. 38) .",

The very act of assigning a public health meaning to a human experience is changing the reality of this experience, thus rendering somewhat less accurate the very knowledge that contributed to assigning this experience a meaning relevant to 3 A significant dimension of this do-ability of one's own biography is the do-ability of one's own health (see Kickbush, Chapter 9). 4 McQueen's chapter in this book discusses how contextualism, together with complexity and reflexivity, challenge the ability for health promotion to develop sound theoretical bases. 5 One major difference between Giddens' and Beck's conceptions of late modernity lies in the generalisation of this conclusion to the natural world (Lash, 1994) . Whereas Beck's Risk Society clearly extends the notion of reflexivity to humanity's attempts to rationally exploit and control nature, Giddens' reflexivity seems to be limited to social innovations. This discrepancy in their thinking is only tangentially related to the argument developed here since it is generally accepted that public health programs and interventions include important social components. public health. An example of public health power to change the meaning of social realities is the labelling by public health of the current tendency for an increasing proportion of North American people to carry excess weight, as an obesity epidemic. This label actually conveys to these overweight people the message that they have a health problem instead of, or in addition to, one of body image. In so doing, it is changing the course of the phenomenon itself: people will not react the same way to health concerns as they do to aesthetic or moral concerns. As a result, public health is always confronting a reality that is being transformed by the knowledge it produces and by its practice to transform the reality. Thus, in public health as in many other techno-scientific endeavours, more knowledge does not necessarily translate into more predictability and control. It often means increasing complexity and uncertainty about the impact of action through unintended consequences and reflexivity.",

One such strategy lay in the confrontation of a multiplicity of perspectives about the situation and in the active exploration of a maximum of the plausible scenarios that are made possible, and are developing, in the course of action. Adding information, even contradictory, is a way of exploring such plausible scenarios (Callon, Lascoumes & Barthe, 2001) . We will later argue that the management of uncertainty resulting from the reflexivity of social practices necessitates that the perspectives being considered and confronted include those of the broadest range of relevant actors. However, in order to properly examine how participation conceived as the confrontation of heterogeneous perspectives contributes to the management of uncertainty, one should first develop a theoretical understanding of the social actions and interactions that take place in situations of participation. And while health promotion is leading the way in advocating that public health practice include active participation, such a theoretically informed understanding is still lacking.",

Public health interventions may take a variety of forms, however, three types dominate public health practice: public policy that regulates social actors' practice through sanctions and norms (e.g.: tobacco regulations; car seat belt laws, safety norms); the development and maintenance of public infrastructures for people to use more or less freely (e.g. clean water, sanitation, bike paths); and programs in the sense of resources and knowledge to achieve specific goals (e.g. vaccination, diabetes prevention, community development). Although the question of participation is relevant to all of these forms, this discussion will mainly focus on programs.",

It is generally accepted that public health programs are composed of resources assembled to create and maintain activities and services designed and implemented to pursue specific objectives in response to a problematic situation that affects a target population in a specific context (Potvin, Haddad, & Frohlich, 2001) . Using a spatial metaphor (MacKian, Elliot, Busby, et al., 2003) , programs can also be characterized as social spaces: they involve network relationships between various social actors drawn together around a common interest; the aim being to create new meanings and/or relationships between actors relevant to the program's objectives. For example, a school-based smoking prevention program would endeavour to change the meaning of tobacco smoking for adolescents, assigning it a negative value, rather than an accepted and cool one. With respect to the space metaphor, those relationships and their content can be mapped to illustrate the general form of those networks, the relative distances between actors involved, as well as the content of these interactions. Also included in the task of modelling a program, is the establishment of a set of criteria that allows for the identification of those relationships that are considered within or outside of the program space.",

This vision is primarily informed by scientific knowledge and often programs are conceived as empirical and real world tests of scientific knowledge (Nutbeam, Smith, & Catford, 1990) . Their rationality is founded on the mastery of relevant technical and instrumental procedures. The legitimization of power lies in the recognised expertise of those actors who are imposing a scientifically informed vision on the other program's actors; the latter are being objectified to the extent that their own objectives and projects are doomed irrelevant for the program. These programs are planned as a series of steps, and their implementation aims at producing a chain of pre-determined events, as prescribed by expert scientific knowledge (Scheirer, 1994) . Even if difficulties in following the set course of actions are encountered, a great deal of efforts is usually deployed to fit the implementation conditions with those experimented during the program development phase (Nutbeam, Smith, & Catford, 1990) .",

At the bottom of the pyramid, program beneficiaries are objectified, in the sense that they constitute the object the program aims to change and the relationships that they entertain with each other are not usually considered to rest within the program space. Finally, the content of the transactions between program actors is constrained by the actors' role, the program's objectives and the logic model.

Scientific knowledge is one among several types of knowledge mobilized to structure and inform such a social space. The vision and objectives of bottom-up programs result from the confrontation of expert objective epidemiological and other types of diagnosis with the subjective knowledge of the local conditions and with values as formulated by concerned actors.

Firstly, because such programs take advantage of horizontal relationships between all categories of actors, complex systems are produced whose initial conditions cannot be controlled by experts, whose evolution cannot be planned in advance, and whose outcomes are mostly unpredictable. Even if health professionals could manipulate the formative stages of a program, they cannot diminish the impact of the existing relationships between the local actors who engage with the program, thus helping to shape the functioning of the program (Potvin & Chabot, 2002) . Secondly, because numerous actors in such programs are identified as spokespersons for various relevant organisations or social groups, and because actors' participation can rarely be imposed, the program structure is more akin to that of a network, reaching out beyond the immediate circle of participants and target groups. Indeed one of the strengths of this public health practice is to be responsive to changes in environmental conditions through its capacity to engage with newly identified relevant actors (Potvin, Cargo, McComber, et al., 2003) .",

It is the beneficiaries' objectified problems that the program is designed to solve. Feedback loops from those beneficiaries towards experts are scarce and rarely effective in modifying experts' practice. Conversely, in bottom up programs, the roles and relationships within the program space do not follow the inside/outside distinction. Diverse forms of knowledge are actively sought and valued to enrich and broaden program's perspective on issues of interest. Thus, for the remainder of the chapter participation will be used as a generic term to encompass: those practices that involve collaborative relationships in the form of exchanges of opinion, knowledge or other resources between various groups of actors concerned by, and willing to, devote time and resources to issues of relevance to health in order to participate in decision making regarding priorities, planning, implementation or evaluation of public health programs.",

The first one analyses participation in terms of a quantifiable characteristic, in the continuity of Arnstein's work (1969) , whose eight-step ladder of citizen participation provides a rating of the degree of control exercised by citizens upon the program. One recent version of this work uses the concept of ownership to describe this sense of control over program features by various groups of actors involved in a program Green & Mercer, 2001) . The second type focuses upon the program's features in which program beneficiaries are involved. Rifkin, Muller, & Bichmann (1988) designed a measurement instrument that identifies participation in five aspects of the program: leadership; needs identification; organisation; resource mobilization; and management. The work of Green et al. (1995) that resulted in an evaluation grid to assess the level of participation in health promotion is a synthesis of these two types of framework. Finally, a third type highlights the ideological dimension of participation. Fournier and Potvin (1995) argue that underlining the promotion of participation are three potentially conflicting values, utilitarianism, democracy, and empowerment. These, in turn result in three forms of participation. Program efficiency is enhanced through utilitarian participation. Representation of beneficiary's diversity is increased through a democratic form. Finally people's control over the conditions of their health is improved though empowering participation 11 .",

Lastly, none of these frameworks provide an analysis of the social processes at play when participation is implemented in health programs.

His sociology of translation renamed, Actor Network Theory, offers a theoretical model for the social process leading to technical innovations. The analogy of innovation is relevant for health promotion programs in the sense that such programs constitute either a local adaptation of programs tried elsewhere or locally designed actions to address local issues. In both cases, programs are innovative set of actions in their local context.

The particular health experts, words used for defining the objectives, persons who are targeted by the program and so on, are all potential mouthpieces for the broader categories to which they belong.

Science as made is composed of the numerous scientific facts that are produced in laboratories and disseminated in the public domain as powerful and almost irrefutable assertions about the state of the world, once they had been validated within the realm of the scientific activity (e.g.: smoking tobacco increases the risk of lung cancer; regular practice of physical activity increases longevity).

All of this compose a process by which the different perspectives from the various actors are confronted in negotiations that redefine these perspectives and recompose existing networks.

This may lead them to hypothesize that there is an interest for public health authorities to preventing the possible dispersion of used condoms in parks and public spaces that may be associated with the legalization of prostitution 14 . The group of initiators could also formulate corresponding hypotheses regarding the local school authorities, adding to it an educational dimension and so on. In so doing however, they lose some of their own control over the definition of the problem and the actions to be undertaken regarding its solution. In reverse, failure to problematize relevant actors early in the action, may lead to the creation of a strong opposition that will elaborate its own problematization of the issue which may be conflicting. To problematize is to create associations between social actors and an issue of interest that is relevant in the pursuit of their own interests, elaborating a network among which some of the actors become essentials for the pursuit of the objectives and interests of other actors.",

While problematization operations position the relevant actors with reference to a given social space, interest sets up the content of their interaction with each other and more specifically with the issue of interest.

In all the operations of translation, the entirety of the individuals composing a group may not be involved throughout the translation process. In fact, most of the negotiations take place with mouthpieces whose legitimacy is denoted by their capacity to mobilize the group they represent. This mobilization of a group's interest by mouthpieces goes on until a limited number of actors can represent the whole network. The operation of mobilization is that by which selected actors identified as mouthpieces for the system or parts of it are entitled to, and do effectively, displace other actors enrolled. The capacity to mobilize a variety of actors in a network is thus the ultimate test of the legitimacy of a system's mouthpieces. The more heterogeneous and the less stable a network, the more intense the negotiation between the groups of actors to establish the legitimacy of the mouthpieces and the more likely it is that more than one mouthpiece will be necessary, or that the network will not survive the rise of a controversy. Of course, in highly hierarchical organisations, the legitimacy is often associated with the position in the hierarchy; however, in emerging networks where controversies are frequent, legitimacy is gained through a negotiation process. The legitimacy of the mouthpieces for those they represent can also be appraised though the various procedures that is required for the former to mobilize the latter. In our previous example because of the hierarchical and program structure of public health organisations, the professional responsible for AIDS prevention might be a representative spokesperson for this group of actors, and she will mobilize resources in her organisation by using the power associated with her role in this organisation, whereas for the group of sex workers, spokespersons may have to be designated through a consultative process.

As mentioned earlier, in his 1986 paper Callon uses as a case example a research program that involves three researchers, a fishermen union and a local seashell population. In this example, the researchers act as the sole translators and spokespersons for the whole network. Neither the seashells nor the fishermen took an active role in any of the translation operations; they reacted to the problematization, interest, enrolment and mobilization operated by researchers. These reactions with regards to the specific roles and identities assigned to them by the researchers' problematization often triggered negotiations and changes in the problematization, but neither the seashells nor the fisherman attempted to translate the other groups of actors in the pursuit of their interest. In addition, the specific seashells and fishermen enrolled in the process could be conceptualised as mouthpieces for their own groups. Not being actively involved in the translation however, neither the seashells nor the fishermen could or would constitute legitimate mouthpieces for the new network of relationships that was created by the translation process. One proposition is that although \"translation\" provides a valid and useful explanation of the social processes occurring in the social space of programs, translation is not equivalent to participation. In Callon's example, the researchers' control over the whole process was rarely challenged, and more importantly, these researchers were never translated by the other groups of actors. Neither seashells nor fishermen actively problematized the situation from their own perspective. As a result, translation as described in most of Callon's work is unidirectional. From the perspective of the translator the range of actions of the other actors is limited by the problematization operated by this unique translator. The main proposition of this chapter is that participation in health promotion programs occurs when at least two actors from different groups representing different initial interests are actively involved as translators of the other groups and as mouthpieces for the entire network. Participation is thus a multidirectional translation process.",

These multiple translation processes involve heterogeneous mouthpieces, each representing the problematization and interests of a relevant group of actors. Each translator is thus involved in two articulated translation processes. In one process, as spokespersons of a specific group of actors, they participate in the group's translation that they, as mouthpieces, can legitimately mobilize. In another process, in promoting the problematization and interests of their own group, they engage in active translations of other groups. Within this context, participation is the confrontation of various groups' problematization of a situation, where none of the groups can, or is willing to impose its own translation to the other groups.",

Due to this, there is a constant reshaping of the program space to adapt to the ever changing results of the various negotiations is another characteristic of participatory programs. It is through this negotiation that participants to the governing structure map out a common problematization of all relevant groups of actors, including those that they are representing in the governing structure. One consequence of this process is the development of equivalences between their respective discourses and representations of the whole system. Each of the translator/spokesperson involved in the governing structure has the potential to become a legitimate spokesperson for the entire network while maintaining an obligation to remain a legitimate spokesperson of his or her own group of actors. The example presented in the Box below shows some of the explanatory power of framing participation in health promotion program as multidirectional translation. 16 Many interesting features of the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project (KSDPP) acquire meaning when analysed through this multiple translation framework (see Macaulay et al., 1997; Potvin et al., 2003 for a detailed description of the project). This project identifies itself as a participatory project, founded upon the functional equal partnership between a group of academic researchers, a group of community researchers/professionals, and the community through the KSDPP Community Advisory Board (CAB), (Macaulay et al., 1998 ). An apparent paradox of this project is that despite the fact that most of the project's interventions are targeted at young people, the latter are not specifically mentioned in the \"Code of Research Ethics\" that form that partnership agreement, neither are they part of the governing structures of the project. The multidirectional articulation model of participation resolves this paradox. In their problematization of the situation of diabetes in their community, the group of elders and community leaders identified children and young people as a key group in the pursuit of their vision of a community free of diabetes. Community leaders could not however interest and enrol children with regards to diabetes prevention without the expert knowledge of community researchers and professionals. In addition, to have access to some of the required funds and 16 In agreement with the Code of Research Ethics developed for this project (KSDPP, 2004) , the chapter and the content of this box were discussed in a seminar with community researchers and representatives of the Community Advisory Board. The author of this chapter had been involved in this project as academic researcher for more than 10 years. Even if the information founding this example is all in the public domain, it was felt that such discussion was important to keep transparent all translation processes and all instances in which a program actor may be perceived as a potential spokesperson for the entire program. resources, community leaders together with community researchers had to develop a research component; this was a necessary apparatus to interest funding agencies and mobilise their resources. This is why academic researchers were problematized, interested, and enrolled in the project. The community, through CAB as spokespersons, the community researchers/professionals and the academic researchers form the governing structure of translators for which the first level translation described earlier applies. Together, and in a concerted manner, they problematize, interest, enrol, and mobilize various other groups of actors, inside and outside of the community. The young people in the community form one such a group. They are mobilized through program activities and to the extent that CAB representatives and community staff in the governing structure are perceived as legitimate spokespersons of community young people's interest, there is no controversy and the governing structure can continue its work. Obviously, one could question whether program staff and community representatives are adequate spokespersons for community young people. The answer to that from a translation perspective is that a controversy will emerge when spokespersons will loose their legitimacy, signalling to the governing structure that the current problematization is not satisfactory for all actors involved and should be revised.",

Interestingly, the group of researchers from outside of the community express very little ownership about the intervention part of the project and a high satisfaction with that situation. In counterpart, some other community organisation members (referred to as community affiliates in Cargo et al. (2003) ), who are associated with the development and implementation of some of the project's activities expressed low satisfaction with their actual level of control over the project. In terms of the two translation processes involved in this participatory program, these results indicate that the CAB members together with the program staff constitute the main actors in the translation process that occurs between the governing structure and community groups. The other community organisations that are translated by this governing structure have less control over the project. As for the academic researchers, their low level of perceived ownership over the project is an indication that the KSDPP has never been conceived as a hypothesis testing experiment and that they accept to be translated in the pursuit of community objectives. Their high level of satisfaction is a sign that through the project they can actively pursue academic objectives of conducting research, producing knowledge, and training graduate students (Potvin et al., 2003) .",

The first is that programs are composed of social actors whose relationships are constantly negotiated within a dynamic problematization of the situation of interest. The second is that participation is a deliberate attempt to make problematization inclusive and relevant for a variety of groups of actors in the pursuit of their own objectives. These ideas are central to understanding how health promotion programs can orient social change in reflexive modernity.",

Meaning, programs cannot be reduced to technical solutions that can be imported in local contexts once they have proved effective. The working hypothesis that such a program could provide a valid answer to a local challenge needs to be problematized within an existing network of local actors. Such problematization, in turns, induces a translation process through which the meaning of the situation and the role of the various actors, including that of the program itself will be renegotiated. Adaptations to local contexts and realignments of the planned actions have to be negotiated continuously because any program aims at a moving target, and the target is moving precisely as a result of the events associated with the program. By proposing a novel problematization of a given situation, health promotion programs introduce new meanings and roles, the effect of which is to induce a new dynamism in the situation of interest. Independently of the carefulness of the planning process, health promotion programs not only are operating in uncertainty but they are themselves sources of uncertainty.",

The optimist modernist reaction is to deny that programs contribute in creating a more complex reality and that when appropriately manipulated, technical solutions derived from objective science leads to predictable outcomes. The pessimist modernist reaction is mainly associated with post modernism; and rests upon the thought that scientific knowledge cannot be translated into technical innovations with predictable effects; there is no possibility to deliberately orient social change in the pursuit of specific objectives. A third posture is to attempt to manage this uncertainty associated with the implementation of health promotion programs. One way of doing so is to foster participation by inviting a variety of groups of relevant actors to actively engage in their own problematization of the situation and to render the multidirectional translation that characterize the process as transparent as possible through a governance structure made of spokespersons of the various groups actively involved as translators.",

Quite on the contrary, it refers to situations in which the range of plausible future developments is identifiable but where each of these possible futures cannot be assigned an exact probability of occurrence. I contend that participation helps manage this uncertainty and this in two ways. Firstly, the exploration of a wider range of possible futures through the negotiation and confrontation of the problematization that various groups of actors entertain about the situation provides a richer and more comprehensive assessment of the mechanism that produced any given situation, therefore resulting in a better informed action. Secondly, because the simultaneous occurrence of those multiple problematizations necessitates the constitution of functioning governance structures that rest on the involvement of spokespersons, a greater variety of groups of relevant actors can be mobilized through the program, thus resulting in a greater capacity to make things happen.",

More than that, by linking a macro social theory such as that of reflexive modernity to a micro social theory of action like the sociology of translation it is expected that such a theoretical exercise would lead to a critical appraisal of public participation as a practice, justifying its promotion in specific situations and providing health promotion practitioners with practical ideas on how to facilitate participation.",

This is even more so when social processes are involved because this is where reflexivity is primarily at play, and as such, probably the reason why the need to advance public participation was more acute in health promotion than in health care for example, because the health promotion clearly positions health in the social domain. In addition, dealing with local social contexts for program implementation necessarily entails some degree of uncertainty, even for programs that are widely recognized as effective. Nonetheless, one should never consider public participation lightly and simply. The uncritical definition of public participation as the involvement of all concerned actors in all aspects of the program is plainly untenable and leads potentially to complete chaos.",
