For this reason, I find images such as the post-apocalyptic world encountered in the opening sequence in the film 12 Monkeys (Gilliam 1995) more interesting and compelling than the aforementioned films. The protagonist, James Cole (Bruce Willis), ventures to the surface of the devastated, burned out Earth. Certainly, there is an absence of human signs of life, but living in the rubble and the ruins of a crumbling city are a host of animals, including a massive grizzly bear. The world has been repopulated by a variety of living things, big and small, that now inhabit the spaces and places once built to accommodate human-oriented actions and purposes. Thus, mass disappearance of humans creates the condition for a mass migration of animals into otherwise restricted zones, producing zoomorphic heterotopias in a post-Anthropocene world.",

Under regulations prohibiting leaving homes except to buy groceries, pick up medicine from pharmacies, or engage in essential tasks, residents of San Francisco have witnessed an uptick in coyote sightings. Without cars to deter them, these resourceful animals have started exploring new territories once too dangerous to enter during daylight hours (Garcia 2020) .

In both cases, what is at stake is the suspension of the capitalist functionality of space. But the potential for wild occupations unleashed by the biopolitical management of coronavirus is perhaps more radical, cutting to the very root of the anthropological machinery that underlies capitalism in the first place. Cities are going feral, while humans sit inside their fragile domiciles watching through binoculars (or obsessively wedded to their computer screens).

The rewilding process brought about by social distancing brings to the surface the permeability of spatial separations along species lines. Infrastructure is played with by hooves rather than hands. And these visitors demand a new notion of citizenship, one which is not exclusive but inclusive. If Henri Lefebvre (1996) once argued for an expansion of who has a right to the city, perhaps we are now in a position to pose this question to non-human animal co-dwellers who have occupied the streets.",

            "text": "Perhaps coronavirus is opening up a new phase of city development. For Lefebvre, cities have grown through three historical phases. First, industrialization tore down existing, traditional urban spaces and reconstructed them to fit the needs and interests of capitalist manufacturing. This is the city as a planned, optimized space of production. The second phase saw the expansion of the urban outward into rural settings, creating suburban zones in the service of industry. Lefebvre refers to the third phase as deurbanized urbanization of city centers. Here, cities empty out to make space for office buildings and large, real-estate developments by white-collar elites. But coronavirus teaches us that we can now add another phase: de-urbanized rewilding of the city. In this phase, humans are displaced by an abundance of non-human animal co-dwellers who suddenly enter the streets and demand their own right to the city. Those at the forefront of this new reality would be human laborers who remain out in the streets maintaining infrastructure, delivering packages, and so forth. Such labor is physically connected to specific conditions in ways that white-collar labor-capable of being mobile, virtual, and thus disembodied-is not. In this sense, blue-collar workers have an opportunity for becoming a new green-collar vanguard for environmental intimacy that white elites remain (safely) sheltered from.",

The positive tendencies of cities, according to Lefebvre, include encountering, simultaneity, and centralization. The right to the city is a right to encounters that are open-ended and dynamic and that are horizontal and expressive. These encounters can be juxtaposed next to exchange and extraction as the dual logics of the capitalist co-optation of cities for production purposes. The right to the city is a right to reclaim centrality, meaning that the center opens up to the margins and the excluded and the oppressed can thus return to the heart of the city and partake in decision-making. And the right to the city is a right to partake in equal measure in the simultaneity of encounters, forming mobile hubs of activity in, across, below, and above the surfaces of the city. In sum, these three dimensions concern the right to play with the city by putting its progressive forces into play, making the city into an emergent performance.",

Lefebvre argues against the unirhythmic monotony of the industrial, capitalist city and, instead, calls on us to fight to preserve polyrhythmic diversity as it emerges from a multitude of swarming encounters. The more diverse the soundtrack of a city, the healthier the city is. Polyrhythmic profiles are compositions of multiple overlapping and potentially conflicting rhythmic patterns. Lefebvre highlights four different rhythmic pairs, including cosmic and mechanic, state and city, daily and extra-daily, and private and public rhythms. For the pandemic city, the cosmic rhythms that are normally in the background, buried behind the pulsations of public, state, daily, and mechanical rhythms, surge to the foreground. The result is a new soundscape that is not immediately subservient to capitalist rhythms of production and distribution. Again, one should not hear the absence of cars as a mere deficit or index of a lack, but rather as an opportunity for posthuman, zoomorphic rhythm analysis.",

They are opening up the possibility for expanded understandings of city encounters that cross species distinctions. Through their interests, needs, and desires, they are reconfiguring where, when, and how city centers might appear. And they are creatively proposing a new composition of simultaneous actions (for instance, foraging and shopping, trash collecting and scavenging, pipelaying and burrow digging). The result is a wild new polyrhythmic soundscape defining the urban environment. Indeed, such experimentation challenges even Lefebvre's notion of polyrhythmic diversity, as it highlights how cities have been overtly dominated by the unirhythms of human actions.",

Exopedagogy is a pedagogy of exodus from anthropocentric ways of thinking and being. The posthuman occupation of cityscapes around the world offers a pedagogy in topological experimentation. Suddenly the city becomes an extended ecotone, or zone of transition between two separate biomes (for instance, forest and city). It is where two communities (human and non-human) meet and negotiate/ integrate. Perhaps we can suggest that Lefebvre's clarion call can be adjusted. We no longer need a right to the city so much as a right to the city as a heterotopic ecotone defined by encounters that promote and sustain environmental intimacies between human and non-human citizens.",
