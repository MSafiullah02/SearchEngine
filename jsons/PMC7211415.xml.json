Measuring compliance with physical distancing is crucial to inform modelling deliberations and enable evidence-based policy making. We have summarised three key approaches that are currently being used to help estimate compliance with lockdowns in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although currently used in a small minority of countries, there is substantial opportunity to scale up use of these approaches globally.",
