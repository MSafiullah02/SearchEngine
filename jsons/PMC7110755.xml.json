In elderly and immunocompromised adults or patients with preexisting diseases, the morbidity and mortality rates have been shown to be significantly higher in RSV-infected patients (Colosia et al., 2017).

However, data concerning the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV subtypes are limited, and there are few reports about the epidemiological status and genotypic characteristics of RSV prevailing in patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) in southern China (Liu et al., 2016). This study was, therefore, performed to investigate the presence of RSV in pediatric (<15 years) and adult (\u226515 years) patients with ARI in Guangzhou. Specimens were collected from ARI patients during 2011\u20132016 and RSV was analyzed along with seven other common respiratory viruses. A phylogenetic analysis of RSV-A and RSV-B strains was performed in order to better understand the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV circulating in southern China.",

The loss of a 24-amino acid fragment in the duplication region of ON1 genotype was observed in three Guangzhou strains (GZ/2014/03, GZ/2014/04, and GZ/2015/43). GZ/2014/03 and GZ/2014/04 lost amino acids 261\u2013284 (i.e., QEETLHSTTSEGYLSPSQVYTTSG) and GZ/2015/43 showed a shift of two amino acids and lost amino acids 263\u2013286 (i.e., ETLHSTTSEGYLSPSQVYTTSGQE). Compared to the A2 prototype, ON1 subtype-specific substitutions (S222P, T253K, and S314L) were observed in all of the ON1 subtypes, and E232G was observed in most of the ON1 strains except GZ/2014/05. M286E, P310L, and S314P were observed in all NA1 strains. Other commonly observed substitutions for RSV-A strains included L208I, P215S, S222P, N237D/Y, T249I, N251Y, E262K, N297Y, P298L, and P320T. There were two deletions (L265 and E308) observed in GZ/2015/16. The analysis of potential N-glycosylation sites revealed that due to the N237Y substitution of ON1 and NA3 genotype, GZ/2015/16 and GZ/2015/10 lost potential N-glycosylation sites at residue 237, but interestingly, due to the D237N substitution, 10 Guangzhou NA1 strains regained this N-glycosylation site. Moreover, due to N318Y, T319A, or T320S/I/P mutation, eight Guangzhou NA1 and one Guangzhou NA3 strains lost the potential N-glycosylation site at residue 318 (Figure 8\n). Compared to the sequences of the representative BA1 strain (BA4128/99B; Fan et al., 2017, Trento et al., 2003), all BA9 strains had K218T, L223P, and S247P substitutions. I281T and H287Y existed in most of the Guangzhou BA9 strains except GZ2012/03 and GZ/2012/15, respectively. Besides the I281A substitution, GZ/2012/03 strain showed a loss of amino acids 254\u2013273 (i.e., TTTSKHTERDTSTSQSIALD). Other commonly observed substitutions for RSV-B strains included P216S/L, I229T, T254I, T275I, and S304P. Due to T312P substitution, three Guangzhou BA9 strains lost potential N-glycosylation sites at residue 310 (Figure 9\n).",

Flu was the second most frequently detected respiratory virus (9.3%). The age characteristics and monthly distribution of RSV and the seven respiratory viruses in Guangzhou during 2011\u20132016 were consistent with those in previous reports (Liu et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2014). A total of 1514 patients were RSV-positive, 91.7% of whom were inpatients, significantly higher than outpatients (p\n < 0.01). The odds ratio of hospitalized patients with RSV infection to outpatient/emergency was 4.14, indicating that RSV infection has a considerable risk of resulting in severe disease. Infants and toddlers (<3 years) not in nursery (59.5%) seemed to have the highest risk of RSV infection, and the reason may lie in the decrease in maternal protective antibodies and the increase in exposure opportunities to crowds. The monthly distribution confirmed that RSV was mainly prevalent in winter and spring, consistent with other regions (Bashir et al., 2017, Slovic et al., 2016). The annual distribution of RSV during 2011\u20132016 in Guangzhou revealed high epidemic years for 2011, 2014, and 2015, with year 2015 as an epidemic peak. There may be a biennial high incidence pattern of RSV in Guangzhou, and surveillance over a longer period will confirm the annual distribution characteristics (Esposito et al., 2015, Xiang et al., 2013).",

It cannot be deduced whether the co-detection of both subtypes exacerbates the disease based on the symptoms.

A similar year distribution pattern has been reported previously in Beijing and Belgium, among others (Xiang et al., 2013, Coggins et al., 1998, Zlateva et al., 2007, Scott et al., 2004). In addition to this pattern, RSV-A has been reported to show an epidemic for 2\u20134 years followed by RSV-B for 1 year pattern, as reported in Uruguay (Arbiza et al., 2005); and also, an RSV-A epidemic for 4 years followed by RSV-B for 1 year pattern, as reported in Japan (Shobugawa et al., 2009). It appears that this is the first time such a year distribution characteristic of RSV subtypes has been reported for Guangzhou. Most of the time, RSV-A and RSV-B took dominance alternately, but in January to June 2014, both RSV-A and RSV-B were epidemic at a high level. The co-detection rate of RSV was as high as 25.1% in Guangzhou from 2011 to 2016, and 91.1% of them were double infections and 8.9% were triple infections. Influenza virus was the most common co-detected virus. No correlation was found between clinical symptoms and co-detection (p\n > 0.05), indicating that co-detection may not aggravate the disease or enhance the mortality of patients. However, this finding may be limited by the small sample size and the heterogeneity of co-detected viruses, and more studies will be needed to elucidate the relationships between RSV co-infection and disease severity.",

According to the genetic diversity, RSV is genotyped mainly by the second high-variant region of the G protein C-terminal (HVR2) (Schobel et al., 2016). Therefore, to better understand the phylogenetic characteristics of RSV in southern China and to gain more insight into RSV variation, we further analyzed the sequences of the G genes of the Guangzhou RSV strains. Most of the RSV-A genotypes from Guangzhou were close to Chongqing and Hong Kong strains and the RSV-B was close to a Chengdu strain. The prevalent RSV-B genotype in Guangzhou during 2011\u20132016 was BA9, whereas the prevalent RSV-A genotypes were more diverse. Among the 30 strains from the years 2011\u20132012, 29 were NA1 and one was ON1. Among the 15 strains from the years 2014\u20132015, 13 were ON1 and the other two were GA5 and BA9, respectively. The 2013 strain belonged to ON1. It can be seen that the NA1 genotype of RSV-A was prevalent in 2011\u20132012, while ON1 became the prevalent genotype in 2014\u20132015, which is consistent with the report of Fan et al. (2017).",

Furthermore, because the population lacked antibody protection, the new genotype spread rapidly and caused the high incidence of RSV-A in 2014\u20132015 in Guangzhou. Combined with the monthly distribution by site, we believe that the epidemic peaks in Zhu Jiang Hospital and Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases in 2014 reflected the prevalence of the new genotype.
