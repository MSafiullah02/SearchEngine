The Hajj is the world's largest and most diverse annual mass gathering of religious and political significance; approximately two to three million pilgrims arrive in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) from about 180 countries, some of them with suboptimal disease surveillance and preparedness capacities, and this has highlighted the global significance of MG.1, 2 Historically, respiratory diseases have been the most common public health condition associated with MG.3 In recent years, the emergence of new respiratory diseases and the potential of MG to act as venues for the global spread of such conditions, has raised additional challenges for public health preparedness with regard to MG.1, 2 No pharmaceutical interventions to prevent all respiratory diseases during a MG are available. Of the non-pharmaceutical measures, only a few are feasible during MG and have been recommended, such as the use of face masks.4 Two recent respiratory conditions of global significance, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2013, have offered opportunities to assess and contrast Hajj pilgrim compliance with the use of face masks.",

However, the finding that significantly more pilgrims used one during the declared pandemic in 2009 could imply that with more targeted and innovative interventions, the rate of face mask use by pilgrims could be increased.
