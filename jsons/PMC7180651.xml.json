            "text": "Twitter has been used for several years to extend the reach of scientific conferences, with growing success. At the 2014 annual Making a Difference in Infectious Diseases conference, which is focused on providing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) educational topics for physicians and pharmacists, a workshop on Twitter for Infectious Diseases Healthcare Providers was held. The conference planners registered the hashtag #MADID14 with the Healthcare Hashtag Project [11]. Individuals at the conference signed up for Twitter and then learned how to follow each other and tweet live from the conference. A total of 235 participants sent 1482 tweets during the 3-day conference. Attendees were able to connect with thought leaders and, more importantly, sustain the connection through Twitter after the meeting. Further, tweets incorporating the hashtag #asm2012, representing the meeting of the American Society of Microbiology, became so popular that it was listed as a \u201ctrending\u201d topic on the Twitter home page [12]. When the Oral versus Intravenous Antibiotics for Bone and Joint Infection (OVIVA) study was first presented at the 2017 European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Disease (ECCMID) [13], clinicians from around the world, whether they were at the conference or not, were able to see the presented slides years before the study was even published and without traveling to Europe. Since publication of the trial [14], the authors have engaged with individuals on Twitter to answer questions about the results of the study. In effect, Twitter allows for quick real-time sharing of educational resources at conferences, enabling individuals that are not able to attend the conference to follow the conference from a distance at any time and stimulating discussion around topics of interest with experts from across the globe. With the help of Twitter, learning is no longer restricted by the time or geographical limitations of the conference.",

These chats are coordinated through the use of a central hashtag that allows people to follow the conversation.

Participants are frequently medical professionals (e.g., physicians, pharmacists) located in North America; however, there have been participants from many countries outside of North America and even The Joint Commission has participated. Cumulatively, the #ASPchat has achieved over 23,000,000 impressions, with an upward trend per chat over time (Fig. 1). These impressions have been calculated through use of the Symplur Healthcare Hashtags Project data source.

Staying current with literature is a challenge, but when the new publications shared on Twitter populate directly into your feed and some of the authors are available to interact with on Twitter, it is all much easier to follow and more engaging. Accordingly, a recent study explored the role of scientific journals on Twitter, analyzing how their articles were tweeted and cited. Over 4000 research articles from 350 scientific journals were extracted, with results revealing that articles from journals with their own account were 46% more tweeted and 34% more cited than articles from journals without a Twitter account. Similar findings were found in a study evaluating the impact of authors having Twitter accounts in dissemination of articles, revealing that scientific papers from Twitter users were 33% more tweeted those of non-Twitter users [15]. These studies demonstrate the strong relationship between dissemination and citation impact with the help of Twitter [16].",

For example, how do surgeons keep current on emerging drug-resistant pathogens and learn about new antibiotics? Most surgeons are not reading the latest ID journals for this information.

Reaching this level of attention is almost unheard of for most of the ID-related content on Twitter [19]. In 2019, for the first time in history, the World Health Organization (WHO) ranked vaccine hesitancy, a \u201creluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines,\u201d among the top ten global health threats, along with Ebola, HIV, and drug-resistant infections [20]. Twitter can serve as a useful site for dissemination of vaccine information, whether informally (by advocates and physicians) or formally (by government entities). One example of vaccine advocacy that has had remarkable influence is Jill Promoli\u2019s work, via her personal account (@jillpromoli) and her organization\u2019s site (@4jude4everyone, #ForJudeForEveryone). Promoli lost her son, Jude, to an influenza B infection in 2015 [21] and has since become an advocate for the influenza vaccination. In 2018 and 2019, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shared his influenza vaccination picture on Twitter, tagging Promoli and @4Jude4everyone in his picture [22, 23]. Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) similarly shared the #forjudeforeveryone hashtag in 2017, urging everyone to receive a flu shot [24].",

The outbreak went undetected until mid-October, and then quickly spread through the population, which had a very low vaccination rate. By November 11, there had been 628 cases and 5 deaths; by January 6 of 2020, 5697 measles cases had been reported, with 83 deaths [25]. Twitter acted as both a repository of information and as an avenue to discuss the outbreak, for both the public and clinicians. The Government of Samoa (@samoagovt) tweeted out details of the outbreak almost daily beginning on November 22, adding additional information on their Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt). This allowed scientists and others on Twitter to discuss the outbreak developments in real time, to craft epidemic curves [26], and to develop timelines of the outbreak in order to dispel the misinformation that the outbreak was caused by the vaccine [27].",

            "text": "Since no systematic process exists to check for incorrect material on Twitter, social media can be a landmine of misinformation. For instance, with vaccines, while Facebook [28], Instagram [29], and Pinterest [30] have made advances to reduce the anti-vaccine information available on their platforms; overall, there has still not been substantial progress in reducing anti-vaccine content on these platforms [31]. Similarly, Twitter is the major social media platform for leading anti-vaccine organizations in the USA and remains a go-to site for convening anti-vaccine political activism and for promoting misinformation. Twitter\u2019s only pushback against such misinformation has been to redirect individuals searching for vaccine-associated keywords to a reputable site (vaccines.gov, run by the US Department of Health and Human Services) [32]. Unfortunately, the anti-vaccine movement has gained traction and doubt in vaccines has grown [33], in part because of misguided tweets and the anti-vaccine posts not being policed by the site and not reportable as a group.",

Even when misinformation is corrected, the mere exposure to such material may cause it to spread [34]. As such, countering misinformation should be performed with consideration. Additionally, those tweeting pro-vaccine information are vulnerable to attacks by anti-vaccine activists and/or bots. A pediatrician was recently the center of attacks after posting a TikTok video, a video-sharing app, encouraging vaccination on Twitter. It took less than 24 h for the video to go viral on both TikTok and Twitter\u2014and just another 48 h before the physician was facing backlash and death threats from people associated with the anti-vaccine movement [35]. Recently, an account was developed in order to \u201crally the troops\u201d in support of an individual under attack by anti-vaccine accounts: @shotsheard. [36]",
