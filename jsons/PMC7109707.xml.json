Amino acids, which are key effectors of gut protein turnover, have been tested extensively in vivo and in vitro, either alone or in combination with other nutrients (7). Glutamine, which is associated with less infectious complications in critically ill patients (8), stimulated protein synthesis in the duodenal mucosa of hypercatabolic dogs (9) or fasted humans (1) but not in the jejunal mucosa of malnourished rats (10). In carbohydrate-fed humans, glutamine affected neither protein synthesis nor proteasome activities in the duodenal mucosa (11) but modulated ubiquitination of several heat shock proteins (12). Arginine and leucine have been shown to stimulate protein synthesis in the small intestine of pigs (13\u201315) but not in the duodenal mucosa of healthy volunteers (16, 17). Surprisingly, the effects of different amino acid or protein mixtures have been poorly documented in the intestine compared with all the data obtained in muscle (18\u201320).",

In contrast, hyperaminoacidemia markedly enhanced the protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR)11 in the ileal mucosa of postoperative patients (23). In healthy humans, intravenous infusion of amino acids did not appear to stimulate the synthesis of pancreatic and mucosal proteins (24), whereas an enteral mixture of nonessential amino acids increased duodenal protein FSR compared with saline (1). Interestingly, recent data suggested that dietary proteins can improve intestinal permeability in patients with Crohn disease (25). In carbohydrate-fed humans, we recently reported that enteral delivery of proteins enhanced protein FSR in human duodenal mucosa (11). However, in this latter study, we failed to observe an activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (11, 26) that usually mediates the effects of amino acids on protein translation in intestinal cells (5, 27, 28) and muscle (29).",

DAVID analysis identified 3 significant annotation clusters (Table 2), of which the highest ranked cluster had an ES of 2.09 and was represented by 2 terms relating to molecular chaperones. The molecular chaperone cluster accounted for 18% of the identified proteins and included T-complex protein 1\u03b4, 14-3-3 protein \u025b, and 2 members of the heat shock protein family [heat shock protein 90\u03b1 and stress-70 protein (mitochondrial)]. These proteins play an important role in protein folding, transport, and degradation. We also discovered that cytoskeletal proteins were significantly enriched among identified proteins and showed higher expression after protein supplementation. The cytoskeleton protein cluster (ES = 1.90, Table 2) was made up from 4 actin cytoskeleton proteins (ezrin, moesin, plastin 1, and \u03b2-actin) and 2 intermediate filament proteins (lamin B1 and vimentin). The last DAVID annotation cluster had an ES of 1.87 and was represented by 3 terms relating to protein metabolism (Table 2). This was supported from analysis of individual functional categories by using DAVID Swiss-Prot Protein Information Resource keywords, which revealed that 5 proteins involved in protein biosynthesis were highly enriched in our protein set (23.3-fold enrichment, P = 8.6E-04). Interestingly, the expression of these proteins was markedly increased in duodenal mucosa after protein supplementation. Three of these are elongation or initiation factors (EF-1\u03b4, EF-2, and eIF3f), whereas 2 others are enzymes that catalyze the ligation of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs (glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase).",

To our knowledge, no previous data have shown an effect of enteral proteins on the intestinal cellular cytoskeleton. However, Montoya et al. (34) have reported an alteration of duodenal villus-crypt architecture in rats consuming a protein-free diet. In patients with Crohn disease, oral supplementation with whey proteins improved intestinal permeability and duodenal mucosal morphology that was also observed with glutamine supplementation (25). Interestingly, amino acids, which are constituents of proteins and signaling molecules, have been shown to affect the expression of cytoskeleton-related proteins. Indeed, under apoptotic conditions, a high dose of glutamine altered the human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cell proteome by modulating the expression of proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization (35). In the jejunum of adult rats, glutamine preserved the actin cytoskeleton and protected the mucosal barrier against ischemia-reperfusion injury (36), whereas arginine promoted an increased permeability and a disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (37). Although the actin cytoskeleton is a key element in cell and tissue organization (38, 39), it also plays a critical role in cell-cell adhesion and maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier (40). The tight junction protein ZO-1 establishes notably a link between actin cytoskeleton and other tight junction proteins such as occludin (41). In our study, protein supplementation did not affect ZO-1, occludin, claudin 1, and claudin 3 expression in human duodenal mucosa (Supplemental Figure 1), suggesting that small intestinal permeability remained unchanged.",

Grimm-G\u00fcnter et al. (44) showed an increased fragility of the intestinal epithelium and a decreased transepithelial resistance in plastin 1 knockout mice, suggesting that plastin 1 was an important regulator of brush-border microvilli morphology. Interestingly, during intestinal adaptation, hyperplasia has been observed and is associated with better outcome by increasing exchange and absorptive surface (45). We can thus speculate that protein infusion may stimulate actin cytoskeleton remodeling in the duodenal mucosa without affecting intestinal permeability, leading to increase the brush-border exchange surface. Additional experiments should evaluate the effects of enteral proteins in patients with short bowel syndrome because ingestion of whey proteins improved the intestinotrophic action of glucagon-like peptide 2 in parenterally fed rats (46).",

These data are in agreement with and extend our previous report showing that enteral supply of proteins enhanced duodenal protein FSR in carbohydrate-fed humans (11). Although eIF3f is a protein involved in apoptotic signaling (47) and translation initiation (48, 49), its role in intestinal cells has been poorly documented until now. Only one study has shown that eIF3f expression was significantly decreased in small intestine tumors (50). Interestingly, eIF3f has been shown to regulate protein synthesis and skeletal muscle mass. Indeed, mTOR/raptor complex bound to the scaffold protein eIF3f during muscle hypertrophy, which phosphorylated S6K1 and regulated downstream effectors of mTOR (51). Conversely, in muscles undergoing atrophy, an accumulation of the inactive form of S6K1 after the degradation of eIF3f by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, named muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx), has been observed (51). In our previous study, neither mTOR nor S6K1 was affected by the protein supply in the duodenal mucosa (11), suggesting that the effects of intestinal eIF3f on protein synthesis were not linked to a regulation of the mTOR pathway. eIF3f has also been reported to be a positive regulator of Notch signaling (52), which is involved in intestinal development and cell turnover (53). The putative role of eIF3f in intestinal cells should be thus evaluated in further experiments.",
