With the help of a novel inter-frame connectivity strategy, we propose an extension of the BM3D method for the scenario where we have multiple images of the same scene. Our proposed extension outperforms all the existing trivial and non-trivial extensions of patch-based denoising methods for multi-frame images. We can achieve a quality difference of as high as 28% over the next best method without using any additional parameters.

Generalised K-Means clustering (K-SVD) [1] , autoencoders [2] and deep neural networks [3] are worth mentioning works in this field. For the past two decades, non-local patch based methods [4, 5, 6, 7] have been among the state-of-art methods for this application. Especially, 3D Block Matching (BM3D) in combination with some non-linear transformations and inverse transformations is a widely used method for denoising images which are corrupted with a variety of noise distributions including Gaussian, Poisson and Poisson-Gaussian mixture types of noise [8, 9, 10, 11] . All the above mentioned research work, however, has been performed on denoising single images. Denoising multi-frame images is a less explored field. Electron microscopy, CT imaging, multi-spectral imaging are some of the fields where we encounter the problem of obtaining one image from multiple noisy images of the same sample/scene. Notable works in the field of multi-frame image denoising include non-local patch-based denoising methods [12, 13] , lowrank tensor approximation framework with Laplacian scale mixture [14, 15] , Stein's unbiased risk estimator and linear expansion of threshold combining methods [16, 17] , multiscale sparsity denoising of spectral domain optical coherence tomography images [18] , non-local energy functional minimisation approach involving spatio-temporal image patches [19] , low-rank tensor modelling based denoising approach [20] , combining blind source separation and block matching for denoising CT images [21] , and tensor based modeling for denoising multi-frame images corrupted with speckle noise [22] .",

In Section 3, we present the denoising results of the experiments performed using various extensions of BM3D. We also perform an analysis on why our proposed extension outperforms the other existing approaches. Finally, in Section 4, we conclude the paper with a summary of our work and some ideas for future research. [5] is a two step method for removing additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Each step consists of three substeps. In the first sub-step of the first main step, a 3D group is created by finding the most similar patches to a reference patch using L 2 distance. In the second sub-step, a 2D biorthogonal spline wavelet transform is applied to this 3D group, followed by a 1D Walsh-Hadamard transform in the third dimension. After a hard thresholding, the 3D group undergoes corresponding 1D and 2D inverse transformations. In the third sub-step, a weighted aggregation of all the denoised pixels at a particular position in the 2D image domain is performed to obtain the final denoised pixel at that particular position. Thus, we have a denoised image after the first step. In the first sub-step of the second step, the grouping is done using the denoised image obtained after the first step. In the second sub-step, a 2D discrete cosine transform followed by a 1D Walsh-Hadamard transform is applied on both 3D groups obtained from the noisy image and the denoised image from the first step. Then a Wiener filter is applied on a combination of both of the above transformed 3D groups. The resulting 3D group is then back transformed. In the third sub-step, the same corresponding strategy as in the first main step gives the final denoised image. Thus, the two main steps primarily only differ at the second sub-step. We refer the reader to the original work [5] for more details on the method. The final denoised image using the weighted aggregation process [6] is described as",

First, we do not have a reference image like in BM3D-3, but follow the denoising procedure for all the images. This is done in order to maximise the use of available information. Second, in the detailed study for selection for BM3D parameters [6] and in the original work [5] , two parameters control the number of patches in a 3D group: The threshold parameter for L 2 distance and the maximum number of patches. In this work we do not use the former parameter as we have the risk of losing some similar patches in the case of highly noisy images. Finally, to obtain the final denoised image, all the other existing extensions perform the weighted aggregation of pixels from 3D groups in just one image. However, since we denoise every image unlike the other three strategies, we perform the weighted aggregation from denoised 3D groups in all the images. The equation that governs the weighted aggregation to obtain the final denoised image is modified as follows:",

            "text": "Generally, the various noisy images of the same scene in a multi-frame image denoising problem are first registered before denoising them to obtain the final image. For the registration, one can use a motion estimation method. However, in this work, our aim is to carry out a comprehensive performance study of the extensions for denoising methods. Thus, we assume that all the images are pre-registered so that we can straight away compare the denoising qualities of various algorithms. It is not difficult to combine the denoising strategies proposed by us with state-of-art motion estimation methods. Hence, to satisfy this experimental setting, we have corrupted Lena, House, Peppers and Bridge 1 images with AWGN of standard deviations \u03c3 noise = 80, 100, 120. Two datasets for each image for each noise standard deviation have been created, one with five realisations of noise and the other with ten realisations of noise. The threshold parameters for L 2 distance while forming the 3D groups have been excluded in both the main steps of BM3D for all the four extensions to keep them on an equal footing. This particular step is advantageous to all the extensions for high standard deviation of noise. One can introduce back these parameters in applications where there is less amount of noise (\u03c3 noise < 80). All the other parameters have been chosen according to the detailed study of parameter selection for BM3D in [6] . It also has to be mentioned that, in the results we showcase shortly, we present the mean squared error (MSE) value for BM3D-3 which is the best of the 5/10 denoised images obtained when every image is selected as the reference frame.",

The images obtained using BM3D-M in particular, appear sharper. Moreover, for the Lena 10-image dataset and \u03c3 noise = 80, the next best method other than BM3D-M is worse by 28%. Thus, BM3D-M has the capability of producing significantly better results than the other algorithms. We attribute these results to the crucial differences in the modelling: inter-frame connectivity strategy in both main steps of BM3D to acquire 3D groups and a weighted aggregation that connects all the frames instead of just one frame.",

This is because BM3D-1 does not retain the same explicit noise model that was introduced in the original image after averaging the noisy images and BM3D-2 does not have enough signal in each of the input images in each dataset. Also, we would generally expect the non-trivial BM3D-3 method to perform better than the BM3D-1 and BM3D-2 methods. The three algorithms other than BM3D-3 perform some sort of averaging while BM3D-3 does not. It simply does not make full use of the information available in all the images.
