Furthermore, these products are consumed by people with allergies to cow milk. In ancient days, except for nomadic life and backyard farming, milk was collected from small farms with small numbers of animals, and milk and milk products were consumed mainly by those living nearby. In the early 1900\u2019s, urbanization level and the demand for dairy products increased, leading to industrialization of the dairy industry in more developed countries. In contrast with the dairy cattle industry, currently, milk production from sheep in many countries still takes place on a small scale and is of minor importance, volume wise (Ranadheera et al., 2018). However, sheep and goat milk have probably been used for a longer time by mankind than cow milk, as sheep and goats were domesticated from around 9000 BC in the Middle East, while cattle were domesticated more than a millennium later (Brandford Oltenacu, 2004).",

Notably, two thirds of the world\u2019s sheep milk is produced in the Mediterranean area. In 2016, Europe produced 3.0 million tons of sheep milk, mainly used for the production of dairy products (Gonzales-Barron et al., 2017). Mostly, processing takes place at farm level, in small local dairies or in regionally operating cheese factories, often using raw milk (Gonzales-Barron et al., 2017). This small scale production results in a wide range of special products made from sheep milk that are mainly regionally consumed (Ranadheera et al., 2018).",

B. melitensis does not grow under refrigerated conditions, but small numbers (10\u2013100 bacteria) can cause disease in man (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2015; El-Sayed and Awad, 2018). Prevalence of Brucella spp. in raw sheep milk will depend on the endemic status of a region, and can be as high as 46 % (FSANZ, 2009b). People get infected by Brucella spp. via contact with birth products of shedding animals and after consumption of contaminated animal products. Risk factors for brucellosis are working on a dairy farm, consumption of raw milk, home slaughtering of sheep, and working in a slaughterhouse (El-Metwally et al., 2011). Control of animal brucellosis, food hygiene measures and pasteurization of milk, known to adequately reduce Brucella spp. (Juffs and Deeth, 2007), are the appropriate methods to reduce the occurrence of this disease (Ducrotoy et al., 2017).",

This pathogen is found worldwide, with the exception of New Zealand (Pires et al., 2017). Although this bacterium can be shed by other animal species like dogs, cats, birds and ticks, ruminants are the main animal reservoir of C. burnetii, which may cause reproductive disorders. After shedding, which mainly occurs in birth products after abortion, but also after normal parturition, C. burnetii contaminated aerosols are the main route of transmission to humans. Worldwide, several airborne outbreaks of Q fever have been related to shedding of C. burnetii by small ruminants (Van den Brom et al., 2015). In the Netherlands, a large Q fever outbreak with shedding dairy sheep and dairy goats as source caused illness in more than 4000 people. Serious complications of Q fever are known and even mortality has been described (Kouijzer et al., 2018).",

Despite this, the role of food in the transmission of C. burnetii to humans is still under debate (Verraes et al., 2015). Being an intracellular bacterium, C. burnetii does not grow in milk. C. burnetii is considered to be heat resistant, but the pasteurization process for milk is designed for a 5\u20136 logarithmic reduction in numbers of this specific pathogen (Juffs and Deeth, 2007; Pexara et al., 2018). Some publications suggest that Q fever outbreaks can be caused by consumption of raw milk (Gale et al., 2015; Pexara et al., 2018). These authors conclude that risk of C. burnetii infection through consumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products cannot be considered negligible but is low in comparison to transmission via inhalation of contaminated aerosols. Viable C. burnetii in cheese made from unpasteurized milk are rarely detected (Gale et al., 2015), but DNA from C. burnetii has been demonstrated by PCR in unpasteurized cheeses (Galiero et al., 2016). Outbreaks of coxiellosis caused by dairy products have not been described for Europe, USA and Canada (FAVV, 2015).",

Dairy farming, especially milking, has the highest risk and is associated with the serovar Hardjo, that can also be present in sheep (Levett, 2001). However, sheep seem less susceptible to leptospirosis than other animal species (Bertelloni et al., 2017). The transmission of Leptospira spp. occurs through urine or other material from infected animals, water, soil or forages. Transmission to humans may occur through contaminated milk, following either direct excretion in milk (rarely) or urinal contamination of milk (Levett, 2001; Ganter, 2015). Nevertheless, milk is not regarded as a transmission route by EFSA (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2015).",

If so, L. monocytogenes may be shed intermittently in high numbers in milk of infected animals (FAVV, 2015; Verraes et al., 2014). Shedding may continue for a long period, also in ewes not showing signs of disease (Gonzales-Barron et al., 2017; Schoder et al., 2011). Ewes with subclinical mastitis are a more important source of contamination than the environment (Condoleo et al., 2017), and in small flocks, one single ewe can have a large impact on L. monocytogenes levels in bulk tank milk. In addition to risk factors as flock size, and feeding silage (Schoder et al., 2011), contamination prevalence may depend on the season, with a decreasing trend from start to end of season after lambing (Condoleo et al., 2017).",

Using pasteurized milk for cheese making effectively reduces the number of L. monocytogenes present in cheese.

(2017) demonstrated goat milk cheeses significantly more often to contain L. monocytogenes (12.8 %; 7 studies) than sheep milk cheeses (3.6 %). Data reported to EFSA (2011\u20132015) show that for cheeses made from sheep milk, soft and semi-soft cheeses were most often contaminated (2.3 %), which is also the case for cow milk cheeses. Interestingly, hard (1.7 %) and fresh cheeses (2.0 %) made from sheep milk contain L. monocytogenes more frequently than cheeses made from cow milk (1.4 %). For hard cheeses made from sheep milk, 0.8 % exceeded the limit of 100 cfu/g. These data counterspeak the general opinion that hard cheeses do not pose such a great risk concerning L. monocytogenes, which is based on the fact that L. monocytogenes has a lesser ability to grow in hard cheeses (Buchanan et al., 2017; Lahou and Uyttendaele, 2017; van Asselt et al., 2017). However, in all cases, soft and semi-soft cheeses showed the highest number of samples exceeding the European Union limit of 100 cfu/g. Based on data presented, it seems fair to suggest that cheese made from sheep or goat milk pose a greater risk to the health of the consumer than cow milk cheese. Although L. monocytogenes is present in raw milk, it is not considered a main hazard in this product (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2015). This pathogen is, however, a hazard in dairy products (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel et al., 2018).",

Furthermore, illness has been reported due to consumption of raw goat milk (Deng et al., 2016), and T. gondii does survive the processing of fresh cheese. However, in a systematic review on the risk of toxoplasmosis from food consumption, unpasteurized milk has been considered as unimportant (Belluco et al., 2017). This may be explained by the fact that tachyzoites are more sensitive to environmental conditions than tissue cysts and oocysts, (FSANZ, 2014). A meta-analysis on the milk-borne infection route of humans by Boughattas (2017) showed that risk factors for the milk borne infection route of T. gondii are consumption of goat milk and milk products, being immunocompromised, and living in North America, Middle East, and Latin territories.

            "text": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus, and is divided into three subtypes. The subtype which is endemic in Central and Western Europe is causing relatively mild symptoms in humans compared to the Siberian and Far-Eastern subtypes (Bogovic and Strle, 2015). Although TBEV is mainly transmitted from animals to humans via tick bites, transmission also occurs via consumption of raw milk and dairy products. TBEV is excreted in the milk by infected animals (Claeys et al., 2013). Symptoms seem to occur more frequently when the virus is transmitted through ingestion via food, than after transmission by tick bites (Dobler et al., 2012). TBEV is killed during pasteurization, and TBE in humans can be prevented by vaccination (Bogovic and Strle, 2015; EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2015; Offerdahl et al., 2016). Foodborne TBE outbreaks in Europe mainly occur after consumption of raw milk and dairy products from goats, followed by raw milk and dairy products from cows, but also cases after consumption of raw sheep milk and cheese have been described (Dobler et al., 2012; Gre\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1 et al., 1975; Kriz et al., 2009; Labuda et al., 2002; Zeman et al., 2004). Only one study, conducted in Poland, describes prevalence data for TBEV in raw milk, which involved screening raw milk from cows (11.1 % of 63 samples), sheep (22.2 % of 27 samples) and goats (20.7 % of 29 samples) (Cisak et al., 2010; EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2015). TBEV remains stable in refrigerated milk, but is inactivated during pasteurization (Offerdahl et al., 2016). In Europe, raw milk and dairy products from small ruminants are considered a main hazard for TBEV infection (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2015).",

Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics by mutations in genes associated with the mechanism of action of the compound or by acquisition of foreign DNA coding for resistance determinants through horizontal gene transfer. These processes occur independently of the use of antibiotics. However, once a resistant mutant emerges, used antibiotics eliminate the susceptible population and resistant bacteria will predominate (Munita and Arias, 2015). Therefore, resistant bacteria nowadays are more frequently seen as a consequence of the use of antibiotics than in the pre-antibiotic era (Ungemach et al., 2006; De Neeling et al., 2007; Scott and Menzies, 2011).",

The aim for the remaining period ending ultimately 2020 is another reduction of more than ten per cent, making a total reduction of at least 75 % per cent in a period of twelve years. During this journey, several hurdles were taken step by step, for example, by improving stable climate, management and use of vaccinations.

None of these involved sheep milk or products made thereof. Based on data reported to EFSA, two outbreaks occurred in 2011 caused by SET in cheese made from sheep milk, and from 2007 to 2016, only eleven outbreaks were reported caused by consumption of sheep milk and products made thereof. One of the reasons for these few reported outbreaks could be the limited consumption of raw drinking milk from sheep in Europe (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2015).

Factors that impact the level of contamination of raw milk include animal-related factors like general animal health, herd size, age and production status, environment-related factors like housing, faeces, feed, soil, and water, and factors related to milking and operation of milking equipment (FSANZ, 2009b). Production and processing of milk from sheep is often performed under less stringent hygiene and quality control regulations compared to that from cattle. Several factors are described as possible reasons for this difference, like lower production per head, milking system, flock management, and wide geographic spread of production (Klinger and Rosenthal, 1997). Furthermore, it is suggested by Gonzales-Barron et al. (2017) that for goat milk cheeses, which are mainly produced in regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East, the higher levels of pathogens associated with this type of cheeses, compared to milk and milk products from sheep, may arise from the more artisanal production system. The same may be true for sheep milk cheeses compared to cow milk cheeses. Overall, these authors showed that pathogens are more prevalent in cheese made from goat milk compared to that from sheep (9,6 %\u20132,5 %) (\nGonzales-Barron et al., 2017). This is however not reflected in the data reported to EFSA (2011\u20132015) that show a pathogen prevalence in cheeses made from cow, goat and sheep milk of 0.9 %, 1.1 %, and 1.3 %, respectively. However, prevalence of pathogens in milk is higher for sheep (7.7 %) and goat (3.7 %) than for cow (1.0 %). In the risk assessment carried out by Juffs and Deeth (2007) for the Australian situation, contamination of raw milk from sheep was considered to occur more frequently than contamination of cow and goat milk with regard to presence of STEC and L. monocytogenes, and less frequently with regard to C. jejuni and Salmonella spp. S. aureus was considered to be more prevalent in goat milk than in either cow or sheep milk.",

Stringent hygiene measures during milking are essential to prevent cross contamination between animals during milking. Furthermore, good hygienic practices throughout the entire production process are important to safeguard the health of dairy consumers. Presence of S. aureus in cheese from both raw and pasteurized milk has been described as an indicator of low hygiene during milking and processing (Gonzales-Barron et al., 2017).",

This inactivation of lactic acid bacteria might enhance the growth ability of potentially pathogenic enterococci (Samelis et al., 2009).",

In the dairy industry, much knowledge is present about these risks, and how to control them. In small scale production systems of sheep milk and dairy products, a higher risk remains compared to industrialized production because of a less protocolled and controlled production process. Especially the so called YOPIs - young children, elderly people, pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons - and those suffering from disease should be aware of the risk of consuming raw sheep milk and raw sheep milk products. Pasteurization, and similar or stronger processes, adequately reduces zoonotic risks of sheep milk and products made thereof, but preventing recontamination and proper cooling throughout the supply chain and at home are essential to keep these products safe.",
