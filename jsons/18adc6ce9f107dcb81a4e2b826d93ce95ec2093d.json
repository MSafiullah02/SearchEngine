In response, many countries all over the world have used different methods to reduce the infection rate, such as including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning public events, and mostly forcing social distancing, including local and national lockdowns. In our work, we use a Monte-Carlo (MC) based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population densities using the most recent epidemic data. We test the spread of the Coronavirus using three different lockdown models, and eight various combinations of constraints, which allow us to examine the efficiency of each model and constraint. The main prediction of this model is that a cyclic schedule of one week without restrictions and two weeks of lockdown can help to control the virus infection. In particular, this model reduces the infection rate when accompanied by social distancing and complete isolation of symptomatic patients.",

One of the most studied these days is the diffusion of pandemics, prompted by the current COVID-19 emergency (see, for example, Ref. [4] ). Many techniques currently employed are based on the solution of differential equations (see, for example, Refs. [5] [6] [7] and many more) or fitting formulae (see, for example, Refs. [8, 9] ) based upon parameters that are varied to obtain several scenarios that are then treated as parts of a statistical ensemble to analyze. For example, in many countries (e.g., Germany, Italy), there is an ample discussion about the role of the so-called R 0 parameter, i.e., the average number of individuals that a single actively infectious person can pass the virus to. The procedures to estimate R 0 are all based on a-posteriori analyses, but are usually part of the parameters that governments use to decide on measures to be taken.",

The algorithm is based on standard Monte-Carlo procedures or sampling the transition among subsequent states, which are essentially sampled from a statistical distribution, in the spirit of transport MC algorithms. * E-mail: hdeleon@ectstar.eu \u2020 E-mail: francesco.pederiva@unitn.it",

In the following, we will present the results of several simulations, meant to reproduce the spread of the Coronavirus in the presence of different lockdown constraints. The high flexibility of the model enables us to control many parameters such as social distancing, infection from an unknown sourced, etc. In Section II, we will describe some details of the model. In Section III, the different models of lockdown considered will be discussed. Section IV is devoted to the presentation and discussion of the results, and Sec. V to the Conclusions.",

The doubling time, T d , is a function of R 0 [16] , such that the higher R 0 , the lower T d . IN particular, T d = 2.5 days corresponds to R 0 =4. In our model, both R 0 and T d are directly obtained from the simulation and not pre-assumed. Figure 1 presents the doubling time, T d as a function of the effective density, N . For each N , we have calculated the percentage of active cases from the total population in the first 14 days. The calculation was performed in the heating phase only, since there are no restrictions. This allows for a sort of calibration of the model to encompass the intrinsic features of the disease. Figure 1 shows that T d is a decreasing function of the density. This means that attempting to describe the current situation of a wide area by means of some average value of R 0 might be highly unappropriate. On the other hand, the spread of the disease over smaller, more homogeneous areas in which the population shares a certain degree of mobility and social behavior would be quite well described by this parameter. To give an example, a value of T d \u2248 2.5, corresponding to R 0 = 4, in the current model would correspond to N = 1.1 \u00b7 10 4 households per squared kilometer. While this might appear an unreasonably high density for an average urban context, it is still much lower than the average density in kindergartens, university classrooms, crowded social, religious or sports events etc. Hence, for the next subsection, we will consider the value N = 1.1 \u00b7 10 4 as representative of potentially dangerous situations that were present on a daily basis before the beginning of the pandemics. This will also show how different constraints affect the initial R 0 = 4, which is the highest estimation for R 0 without restrictions.",

Even though it is challenging to model the specific characters of each Coronavirus infected area, some characteristics are common to all simulations. The first 50 days have the same constraints-no restriction from the first day up to day 14 and a full lockdown from day 15 until day 50. Our numerical results show that even for R 0 = 4, forcing a lockdown after 14 days from the first case controls the spread of the Coronavirus in a way that the peak number of cases occurs on day 24, while the rate of increase in the number of cases starts decreasing as of the 15 th day. Also, since the average time for recovery is 14 day (though up 40 days for very severe cases) and the typical infection period ranges from the 3 rd day until the 7 th day, the decreasing rate of the number of active cases during the lockdown is much slower than the increasing rate of the number of active cases without restrictions (as seen in various countries around the world[17]). Hence, we find that for an initial heating period of 14 days, the necessary lockdown period (i.e., the cooling time) required to control the number of active cases is much longer than 14 days.",

In our simulations, we have tested several a few such exit strategies using different constraints. All of our numerical results indicate that the isolation of symptomatic patients (strict social distancing, panels (b) and (d) of Figure 2 ) is effective and can reduce the peak number of active cases by about a factor two without further restrictions, and up to a factor of 10 for model 4. Also, from Figure 2 , we find that moderate social distancing can reduce the number of active cases, but never as effectively as home isolation of symptomatic patients. impose lockdown in models 2 and 3, which is reflected in a more moderate increase in the number of active cases in comparison to that of days 51 until 57. The increased effectiveness of model 4 in reducing the number of active cases originates from the fact that, since it takes more than a week to cool the system, a week-week strategy model 3 cannot cause significant cooling of the system. An effective exit strategy might be based on cycles, including at least ten days of lockdown (see, for example, Ref . [5] ). In Figure 4 we present our numerical results for a 4-10 days cyclic exit strategy for different \u03c3 low . Similar to Figure 2 , also here, the upper (lower) panels of Fig. 2 are the numerical result without (with) unknown sources. For both cases, in panels (b) and (d), the numerical results are for the case that sick people with symptoms must keep 8 meters from healthy people (strict SD). Fig. 4 shows that, as predicted, for instance, in Ref. [5] , a 4-10 days cyclic exit strategy might be effective and might be used for controlling the infection rate when accompanied by home isolation of symptomatic patients.",

The main feature of this model lies in its extreme flexibility and in the fact that the parameter R 0 is obtained from the simulation and not pre-assumed. It can rather be used, in principle, as a way to better tune up the other parameters based on the post-processing of clinical and epidemiological data. Although it is challenging to model the specific characters of each Coronavirus infected area, our results show that strict social distancing and a cyclic pattern might help to keep the infection rate under control over a long time span, even for an intrinsic doubling time of 2.5 days and in the presence of infection from unknown sources. From the physical point of view, effective strategies for controlling the infection rate of a specific area should lower its effective temperature as much as possible by keeping social distancing but also avoiding creating hot spots such as those related to high concentrations of people on a daily basis.",
