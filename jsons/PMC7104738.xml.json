The H7 subtype HA gene has been found in combination with all nine NA subtype genes [9]. Other influenza A subtype H7 viruses, such as H7N2, H7N3 and H7N7, were documented being capable of infecting human as well [10], [11], [12], [13], but usually self-limiting.",

As many of the H7N9 patients, the H7N4 patient also had similar comorbidities, clinical abnormalities and complications, as well as bacterial secondary infection. Analogous treatment [22], such as the combination of antiviral, immunoglobulin and antibiotics therapy, showed effectiveness for treating H7N4 infection in this case as well. The patient\u2019s recovery was associated with the negativity of H7N4 virus in throat swabs and the elevation of neutralizing antibody titers to H7N4 in sera. Both results of clinical blood biochemistry tests, such as normal or decreased number of white blood cells and lymphocytopenia during acute phase, and fast progressed diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation indicated by chest CT scans, are the typical characteristics of infection with avian influenza, rather than MP, which is featured with slowly developing syndrome and bibasilar streaky infiltrates presented on chest CT scan [23]. The detection of HSV-1 was probably due to the reactivation of the latent virus [24], and the detection of HCov 229E during the patient\u2019s recovery phase was likely a mild secondary infection. The occasional identification of Klebsiella pneumoniae in patient\u2019s sputum was probably due to a transient nosocomial infection or contamination [25], as the pathogen was consistently negative for PCR in the patient\u2019s throat swabs collected from day 11 to day 27. Our PCR-testing platform for 28 respiratory pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, provided an efficient alternative for detecting infection or co-infection of pathogenic agents.",

K627 in PB2 could increase virulence in mammalian hosts [28]. Comparison of the NGS data of JS1 and chicken viruses suggests that virus adaptation caused by E627K conversion had occurred during virus replication in the patient. Besides, M30D and T215A mutations in M1, and P42S mutation in NS1 are associated with increased virulence in mice [29]. The existence of multiple comorbidities of the patient could also add to the severity of the H7N4 infection. In contrast, the susceptibility of the virus to antivirals (H274 in NA) suggested that the early administration of Oseltamivir phosphate probably contributed to the fully recovery of the patient.",
