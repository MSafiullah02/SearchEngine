For example, although there were more than 10 million individuals infected with Schistosoma japonicum in 12 provinces of southern China in the mid-1950s, this number was reduced to less than 1 million half a century later.6 In parallel, transmission was interrupted in five provinces.",

Although the snail habitats were substantially reduced and the number of human infections steadily declined, the disease remained hard to eliminate.",

The panel\ngives a summary, which we hope will stimulate the scientific community and national schistosomiasis control-managers elsewhere. In view of the remaining challenges for sustainable control of schistosomiasis in China, mid-term and long-term goals have been developed: ie, reduce prevalence of infection by S japonicum below 5% by 2008 (infection control) and decrease infection below 1% by 2015 (transmission control) in all endemic areas. To achieve these targets,5, 12 the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a four-pronged approach is being investigated in different settings, with the aim of interrupting environmental contamination of schistosome eggs by human beings and bovines. This strategy consists of: first, improved mechanisation of agriculture, to replace buffaloes with tractors. Second, avoidance of marshland pastures and introduction of fenced cattle-farming, as has already been done for pig-farming. Third, installation of sanitation facilities in houses. Fourth and last, provision of toilets for mobile populations (eg, fishermen).12\nPanelLessons from 50 years of schistosomiasis control in China\nGovernmental policy\n\n\u2022Recognition of the public-health significance of schistosomiasis\u2022Political will and commitment to control schistosomiasis\n\nControl strategy\n\n\u2022Use of multiple interventions in integrated way\u2022Adapt control interventions for specific eco-epidemiological settings and over time as the challenge of control changes\n\nImplementation, monitoring, and surveillance\n\n\u2022Rigorous surveillance and monitoring of human and bovine prevalence and snail-infested areas\n",
