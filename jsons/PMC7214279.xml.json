Pharmacologically, remdesivir has been designed to efficiently deliver the monophosphate nucleoside analogue GS-441524 into cells. Inside the cells, the GS-441524 monophosphate undergoes rapid conversion to the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate form GS-443902. Nucleoside triphosphate GS-443902 acts as an analogue of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with the natural ATP substrate to selectively inhibit viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The primary mechanism of inhibition is the incorporation of the nucleoside triphosphate GS-443902 into nascent RNA chains by viral RdRp, causing delayed RNA chain termination during the process of viral replication [4]. In summary, remdesivir is a prodrug and inhibits viral RNA polymerases, when intracellularly metabolized to an ATP analogue.",

Interestingly, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) named The Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM, NCT03719586) conducted in 681 patients of acute EBV, remdesivir was found to be less effective than other monoclonal antibodies, while the mortality was 53% (significantly worse) with remdesivir, compared to 35% with the most active antibody MAB114. Authors alluded these differences due to more sicker patients in the remdesivir arm [5]. Another double-blind phase II RCT study named Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia IV (PREVAIL IV, NCT02818582) conducted in chronic carriers of EVD (n = 38) has been recently completed, although the full results are still not available in literature [6].",

United State Food Drug Administration (US FDA) urgently gave the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) permission for remdesivir in COVID-19 on May 1, 2020. The current EUA have permitted the use of remdesivir only to treat adults and children with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and severe disease defined as SpO2 \u2264 94% on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in an in-patient hospital setting [16]. Historically, this would be the third time USFDA has given any drug to have a EUA in human, in the absence of approved indication, pending the results from a large robust trial. Interestingly, earlier on March 30, 2020, FDA also gave EUA to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19, in the absence of approved indication [17]. In the past, an investigational neuraminidase inhibitor - peramivir was given EUA by the FDA for severely ill patients with H1N1 influenza, during the 2009\u20132010 outbreak. Although later, RCT failed to show any benefit of peramivir, compared with the placebo, in severely ill hospitalized patients with influenza. Nonetheless, peramivir has been approved only for uncomplicated influenza, since 2014. It should be noted that the compassionate use of remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation got approval by European Medical Agency on April 3, 2020.",

Interestingly, improvement was seen in 100% of patients with mild (receiving no supplemental or low-flow oxygen) and 71% patients with moderate (receiving high-flow supplemental oxygen) COVID-19 at the baseline.

[21] found no significant difference in primary outcome of time to clinical improvement within 28-days either in intention-to-treat analysis (median 21.0 days in remdesivir vs. 23 days in placebo arm; hazard ratio [HR] 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87\u20131.75, favoring remdesivir) or in the per-protocol analysis (median 21.0 days in remdesivir vs. 23 days in placebo arm; HR 1.27, 95% CI; 0.89\u20131.80, favoring remdesivir). Clinical improvement was defined as a two-point improvement on a 6-point ordinal scale (as mentioned above in study by Grein et al.). Moreover, no significant difference in 28-day mortality observed between the remdesivir and placebo (14% death in remdesivir vs. 13% in placebo group; \u0394 1.1%, 95% CI, \u22128.1 to 10.3%) group. No difference in viral load exhibited between the two arms. Neither any difference in outcome was observed in patient receiving remdesivir early (within 10 days of illness) or late (after 10 days of illness). It should be noted that this trial was stopped early after recruiting 236 patients due to the lack of eligible patient in Wuhan, although it was powered for the inclusion of 453 patients. This early stop may have made this a statistically underpowered trial to have any conclusive result. Nevertheless, it was calculated that even if 453 patients would have been recruited, this trial could not have demonstrated any benefit [22]. Collectively, this suggest that despite an available result from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we still do not know the benefit or harm of remdesivir, compared to the placebo in patients with severe COVID-19. Another DBRCT of remdesivir in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients (n = 308) conducted in China is expected anytime soon [23].",

This study was conducted at 68 sites (47 in 10.13039/100011408USA and 21 in Europe and Asia) and sponsored by 10.13039/100000060NIAID, the part of the 10.13039/100000002National Institutes of Health. Preliminary results indicate that the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared to 15 days for those who received placebo, thereby suggesting that patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (p < 0.001). However, the survival benefit with remdesivir was not statistically significant compared to the control, since remdesivir group had a mortality rate of 8.0% compared to 11.6% for the placebo group (p = 0.059) [15].",

Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale (vide Table 1). The study showed 10-days course had similar outcome, compared to 5-days course (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.51\u20131.12) assessed on Day 14, without any new safety signals. Interestingly, 5-days course faired similar although more impressive to 10-days course of remdesivir. The time to clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 day vs. 11 day in the 5-days vs. 10-days treatment group, respectively. Patients discharged from the hospital by Day 14 was 60.0% vs. 52.3%, in 5-days vs. 10-days groups, respectively (p = 0.14). Clinical recovery at Day 14 was 64.5% vs. 58.3% in 5-days vs. 10-days group, respectively. Interestingly, the overall mortality rate in 320 patients on Day 14 was only 7% in both treatment groups but outside of Italy. An exploratory analysis of this study suggested a larger benefit, if remdesivir was initiated early within 10 days of symptoms. Pooled data from both the arm found that at Day 14, 62% vs. 49% got discharged from the hospital, if remdesivir was started within 10 days vs. after 10 days of symptoms, respectively [24].",

SBECD is used in the formulation as a solubilizing agent due to the limited aqueous solubility of remdesivir. Since SBECD is renally cleared, subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment may have SBECD exposures. A close look on eGFR is necessary while administrating remdesivir, especially in patients with known renal impairment and discontinuation is required if eGFR decrease to \u226550%. Although the parent compound remdesivir has only minor renal excretion, but since urine is found to have 49% of its metabolite GS-441524, impaired renal impairment may theoretically increase plasma exposure to this metabolite. Nevertheless, given the benefit-risk ratio in patients with COVID-19, no dose modification is currently recommended patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, although it is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min). It should be noted that no specific studies have been conducted with remdesivir in patients with renal impairment [4].",

Given the benefit-risk ratio, no dose modification is currently recommended in patients with COVID-19, though it is contraindicated in patients with alanine transferase (ALT) > 5-times upper limit of normal or severe hepatic dysfunction. There are no specific studies conducted with remdesivir in patients with hepatic dysfunction [4].",

Table 2 summarize the comparison of results from both pre-clinical and clinical studies of these 4 repurposed candidate drugs. Animal studies clearly hinted that early administration of remdesivir was more effective like other acute viral diseases. From this point of view, treating patients those already have respiratory failure, may not represent the optimal use of remdesivir. However, since viral shedding in COVID-19 and intensive care tend to be more protracted, even late administration could be useful. In this regard, FDA has currently authorized remdesivir only in severe COVID-19 in both adults and children. With regards to the outcome of remdesivir in COVID-19, while one RCT found no benefit, preliminary results from other RCT have shown some benefit. Therefore, the overall outcome with remdesivir is perhaps in a stage of clinical equipoise at this point of time. The safety profile of remdesivir in COVID-19 is incompletely characterized in COVID-19. While the safety data from the previous use during acute EVD suggest no specific alarm, COVID-19 differs profoundly in its clinical characteristics from EVD. Nevertheless, hitherto no safety findings allows remdesivir to be used in COVID-19, under a proper pharmacovigilance. Special attention should be given for disproportionate rise in ALT or decrease in GFR during the treatment with remdesivir. The current contraindication of starting remdesivir with concomitant vasopressors use is primarily based on this being an indication of end organ failure. In contrast, once a patient initiates treatment with remdesivir, subsequent use of vasopressors is not a reason for discontinuation of remdesivir. Moreover, the use of vasopressor at low/medium doses for inotropic support due to the use of sedation and paralytics while on the ventilator is allowed.",
