The emergence of the HPAI was fi rst reported in Vietnam at the end of 2003 (Delquigny et al. 2004 ) . Three major epidemic waves of HPAI have occurred in poultry, resulting in 45 million birds culled between December 2003 and August 2005, leading to a 0.5 % reduction in GDP in 2004. As of 2012, a total of 123 confi rmed human cases and 61 deaths were recorded (World Health Organization 2012 ) . The country has attempted to control the infection through massive, repeated vaccination campaigns in combination with other control measures (Gilbert et al. 2008a ) . Vietnam is a particularly useful country to examine development transitions and their associated environmental transformations because these processes are occurring both exceptionally rapidly and simultaneously as traditional agricultural lands are converted to intensifi ed commercial farming or reshaped into urban settlements to meet the needs of the growing population attracted to cities for emerging job opportunities (Douglass et al. 2002 ; Spencer 2007 ) . If development transitions do pose new challenges to governance, and in particular environmental health challenges, then one would expect to see more of these types of problems in transitional agricultural or peri-urban areas as distinct from both predominately urban and rural areas.",

Parallel to this, in biological science a re-envisioning has occurred in which nature is no longer seen as consisting of balanced ecological systems made up of relatively linear processes. Rather, natural systems are now seen as hierarchical, self-organized, non-equilibrial and non-linear systems in which emerging diseases can themselves be seen as \"emerging properties\" of these CAS (Levin 1999 ) .

            "text": "As such, ecosystems, including \"social-ecological systems\" are now understood as characteristically producing emergent phenomena like the unexpected appearance of new pathogens, inherently unpredictable by conventional approaches and theory (e.g., epidemiological models). Moreover, nearly all emerging diseases are vector borne or zoonotic (i.e., maintained in natural host-pathogen cycles that \"spill over\" to humans) (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005 ) . They, or their immediate progenitors, exist as part of naturally co-evolved host-parasite complexes embedded within ecosystems, whose dynamics normally include non-linear, cross-scale behavior (Horwitz and Wilcox 2005 ) . Based largely on complexity theory, social ecological systems and resilience (SESR) theory was developed to account for the non-linear dynamic behavior of CNH systems that result from intervention in \"managed\" ecosystems that unwittingly lead to unexpected and sometimes catastrophic outcomes, including disease re-emergence. Holling ( 1973 ) introduced the concept of resilience into the ecological literature as a way of understanding nonlinear dynamics, such as the processes by which ecosystems maintain themselves in the face of change. In a resilient forest ecosystem, for example, four phases of change repeat themselves again and again. The fi rst two phases, exploitation (the establishment of pioneering species) and conservation (the consolidation of nutrients and biomass), lead to an old growth forest or a climax community. But this climax community invites environmental disturbances such as fi re or disease, and is more susceptible to disturbances than non-climax forests. When surprise or change occurs, the accumulated capital is suddenly released producing other kinds of opportunity, termed creative destruction. Release, a very rapid stage, is followed by reorganization in which, for example, nutrients released from the trees by fi re will be fi xed in other parts of the ecosystem as the renewal of the forest starts again (Berkes et al. 2003 ) . Holling suggested that human societies also reproduce and reinvent in the process of cyclic transformations; he writes: \"The bewildering, entrancing, unpredictable nature of nature and people, the richness, diversity and changeability of life come from the evolutionary dance generated by cycles of growth, collapse, reorganization, renewal and re-establishment\" (Holling 2003 : xv) .",

            "text": "Several social science theories relevant to the notion of types of development transitions are also relevant to both the Wilcox-Gubler-Colwell hypothesis and Holling's resilience theory. Our starting point is the theory of the Environmental Kuznet's Curve (EKC) from the discipline of development economics. Nobel Prize winner Simon Kuznets proposed that with respect to inequality, economic development is not linear but rather an inverted 'u' shape; economic development is a transition from an initial state of relative equality to an end state also of relative equality, but in the midst of economic development nation-states display high levels of economic inequality (line C in Fig. 5 .1 is a Kuznets curve). While various scholars have shown that Kuznets curves are not universally applicable (see Park et al. 2007 ), Kuznets curves have become a simple but powerful method for empirically testing hypotheses about transitional states. The EKC hypothesizes that certain indicators of environmental degradation tend to get worse as modern economic growth occurs until average income reaches a certain point over the course of development (Grossman and Krueger 1995 ) . Urban air pollution and deforestation have been cited as examples of environmental quality variables that follow the EKC. Recent empirical work has applied this understanding to the issue of HPAI (Spencer 2013 ) , indicating that disease occurrence may be most likely where settlements are undergoing the most intense transitions. Such evidence suggests that a deeper understanding of \"transition\" is warranted.",

            "text": "While some environmental quality indicators such as landfi lls and biodiversity do not seem to follow the EKC, supporters of the theory have argued that this may be more to do with issues of scale. Traditionally, most of the empirical work on EKC has been based on inter-country analysis of cross-sectional data. Often global regions (groups of countries) have been the unit of analysis. Most commonly, the metrics chosen for the predictor variable have been Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or GDP per capita, often adjusted by purchasing power parity or the Human Development Index (HDI). To address the scale issue we are examining whether the EKC is valid at the lowest level of government administration-the commune or municipal ward-for the entire country of Vietnam using readily available census data. The outcome variable is HPAI in domestic poultry. We are faced with the challenge that at the commune/ward level metrics such as GDP or HDI are not valid or are diffi cult to measure (e.g., because data are not available). Furthermore, using a binomial variable-whether a place is rural or urban (as classifi ed by the government) has two problems: (1) one cannot test the non-linearity of the curve and (2) it contradicts our fundamental premise that a signifi cant number of places are not easily classifi able as being either rural or urban. Thus, we are forced to fi nd a new metric refl ecting development, which is ordinal with at least three levels. The \"urbanicity\" method from the fi eld of urban geography is useful for classifying place (Allender et al. 2008 ; Dahly and Adair 2007 ; McDade and Adair 2001 ; Vlahov and Galea 2002 ) . Though most of the urbanicity metrics in the literature are continuous scale metrics, we adapt the principles to create an ordinal scale metric.",

            "text": "Another social science theory relevant to understanding the relationship between development transitions and EID comes from Smith ( 1990 ) , who proposed an environmental risk transition where the environmental factors leading to ill health were categorized as traditional or modern. This categorization is based on the premise that the major environmental causes of traditional diseases are problems at the household level (e.g., water, sanitation, food availability and quality, ventilation and indoor air pollution). As these are addressed during development there is an increase in the relative importance of the major environmental causes of more modern diseases which operate at the community level (i.e., urban air quality, occupational hazards, toxic chemicals, and motorization). As these are addressed in richer societies a further transition occurs to increase the importance of environmental hazards at the global level (e.g., global warming, land-use change) (Holdren and Smith 2000 ; McGranahan et al. 2000 ; Smith and Akbar 2003 ) . Figure 5 .1 shows the environmental risk transition framework in which traditional risks fall with social and economic development, transitional risks rise and then fall, and modern risks rise throughout the development process. Smith and Ezzati ( 2005 ) write that limited or no research has attempted to apply this framework to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases caused by evolving human activities such as those associated with trade, tourism, terrorism, and human interactions with natural environments.",

A forest transition occurs when an initial surge in economic activity spurs deforestation, but as economic activity continues to intensify and cities grow larger, a 'turnaround' occurs, and deforestation gives way to reforestation. The agrarian transition has been defi ned as a number of inter-related phenomena. These include agricultural extensifi cation and intensifi cation (the amount of agricultural land is hypothesized to follow a Kuznets curve as extensifi cation precedes intensifi cation, but intensifi cation then leads to the abandonment of marginal land); increased integration of production into market-based systems of exchange; heightened mobility of populations both within and across national borders as people are attracted to opportunities both within and outside of the agricultural sector; and processes of environmental change that refl ect new human impacts and new valuations of resources (Akram-Lodhi 2004 ; Rigg and Vandergeest 2012 ; De Koninck 2004 ) . The urbanization transition includes two parallel processes: population concentration (population is hypothesized to increase linearly) and the development of socio-physical infrastructure to manage the inevitable confl icts and problems associated with higher density living (infrastructure is hypothesized to increase linearly). The urban transition in developing countries describes societies that have rapidly changed from rural to urban forms of social and physical organization in relatively short time periods (Douglass 2000 ; Montgomery et al. 2004 ) such as those found in Southeast Asia.",

A better understanding of the relationship between development transitions and EID is critical for improving our ability to predict and respond to EID. This is particularly true in Vietnam where government policies have facilitated what can broadly be called a \"transition to the market\" (Arkadie and Mallon 2003 ; De Vylder 1990 ; Fforde and Vylder 1996 ) . Economic policies have driven changes in the built environment that have created new ecological health risks (Oliveira et al. 2004 ; Smith 1997 ) , migration to cities has simultaneously uprooted residents from local social networks and placed them into new neighborhood associations, water user-groups, and other forms of social organization (Crane 1994 ; Spencer 2007 ) . These new socio-physical ecologies present new challenges that, in turn, require new forms of social organization and governance, many of which do not yet exist, to provide basic services such as water and sanitation, education, housing, and public health.",

            "text": "A fi nal social science perspective that has received little attention to date in the developing world relates to theories of behavioral decision making and perceptions of risk. This fi eld draws primarily from economics, psychology, philosophy, anthropology, and cognitive science. Researchers have developed tools such as the Social Amplifi cation of Risk Framework Pidgeon et al. 2003 ) to describe and explain the societal processing of risk signals, but tests of such frameworks are rare because of the diffi culty in predicting when risk amplifi cation conditions are likely to occur (Frewer et al. 2002 ) . A central insight of decision theory is that risk responses are based on socially constructed perceptions of risk. That is, risk means different things to different people; it cannot be measured independent of our minds and cultures. People prioritize risks in different ways, depending on their beliefs about the need to try to reduce a risk (Douglas and Wildavsky 1982 ; Hofstede 1984 ; Park et al. 2007 ) . Research conducted in the developed world suggests that perceived risk is related strongly to feelings of control and trust (Slovic 2000 ) . Some authors suggest that people perceive low risk during modernization because they feel they are in control of technology, nature, or society and that regulatory authorities can be trusted (Bauman 1992 ; Beck 1999 ; Giddens 1992 ) . Over time, however, perceived risk increases as feelings of control and trust are eroded. Some people will respond swiftly and comprehensively to a risk event and others will respond more slowly, depending on a range of psychological and socio-cultural variables and environmental conditions. However, the relative importance of various elements in CNH systems (i.e., socio-ecological and socio-psychological factors) in determining perceptions of and responses to the risk of EID in rapidly developing societies has not been examined.",

These methods are useful in defi ning the range and variability of conceptualizations of risks such as disease outbreaks and how they might relate to environmental change (O'Brien 1993 ) . Quantitative methods (e.g., decision analysis, process tracing, surveys) are more readily applied with larger samples and allow precise measurement of the information integration strategies decision makers use to determine their risk response.

An understanding of the system is also crucial to making such results practically useful.

            "text": "In sum, the conceptual framework introduced in this chapter relies heavily on the integration of multiple social science theories and methods from diverse disciplines (e.g., environmental economics, geography, decision and risk science, urban and regional development, and spatial information science). Identifying key components of these theories relevant to the notion of types of development transitions provides a coherent approach to analyzing the complex interactions among natural and human systems at diverse spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. In the next section we provide reasons for the choice of important elements to characterize CNH systems. Kapan et al. ( 2006 ) hypothesized that the on-going process in Southeast Asia of replacing traditional farming methods such as multi-species livestock husbandry with industrial, mass-production-oriented operations poses signifi cant environmental health risks (e.g., Mallin and Cahoon 2003 ) due to increases in livestock pools and thus opportunities for disease transmission. Simultaneously, rapid urban and peri-urban development in these countries has often been accompanied by more refuse, standing water, and animals in and around homes that have been correlated with environmental health risks (e.g., Graham et al. 2004 ) . With respect to HPAI, expansion of the urban fringe has placed a larger proportion of the human population in contact with formerly dispersed farm environments that include potentially infected poultry and swine populations. Such urban-rural interfaces have been hotspots of other infectious diseases such as leishmaniasis (Oliveira et al. 2004 ). An array of anthropogenic and ecological studies of the determinants of HPAI in Southeast Asia has supported these hypotheses. Gilbert et al. ( 2006 Gilbert et al. ( , 2007 showed that the interaction of poultry and particularly domestic duck populations within the rice paddy production system was as an important factor for the maintenance and spread of HPAI virus in Thailand. Pfeiffer et al. ( 2007 ) showed that rice paddy production intensity and density of domestic chickens and water birds were also associated with a higher risk of HPAI outbreaks in Vietnam, lending support to the rice-duck-chicken hypothesis. The same study showed that increased distance from high density human population areas consistently decreased HPAI risk (Pfeiffer et al. 2007 ) . The study fi nds support for the hypothesis of \"the presence of a fairly widespread infection reservoir in Vietnam \u2026, possibly in domestic and wild water birds\" (Pfeiffer et al. 2007 ). Gilbert et al. ( 2008b ) demonstrated that a few key factors such as human population density, rice cropping intensity, and to some extent poultry density, managed to explain a large proportion of the spatial variation in HPAI disease risk; the same study also notes that considerable variation remained unexplained, and suggests that other factors such as poultry production and marketing systems, agricultural seasonality, the potential for contacts between domestic and wild birds, and climatic and other conditions affecting the persistence of the virus in the environment should be considered. Fang et al. ( 2008 ) found the minimal distance to the nearest national highway, annual precipitation, and the interaction between minimal distance to the nearest lake and wetland, were important predictive environmental variables for the risk of HPAI in China. A study of postvaccination outbreaks in southern Vietnam found poultry fl ock density, fraction of houses with electricity, rescaled Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, buffalo density and sweet potato yield to be signifi cant risk factors (Henning et al. 2009 ).",

            "text": "Of particular interest to this study is the claim by Gilbert et al. ( 2014 ) that the highest risks of HPAI impact in Southeast Asia are to be expected where extensive and intensive systems of poultry production co-exist. The extensive systems allow virus circulation and persistence; the intensive systems promote disease evolution. A study in Thailand found differences in avian infl uenza risk rates across scale of operations (Otte et al. 2006 ) , which was attributed to bio-security (waste management) features. Spencer ( 2013 ) sought to establish whether bird deaths followed a Kuznets curve as settlement infrastructure patterns evolved. Vietnam's 1999 Census of Population and Housing provides counts of households by housing construction materials (traditional/temporary or modern), water supply (stream, rain, well, piped), and sanitation infrastructure (none, pit, composting, fl ush). Spencer converted each of these 4-category, ranked urbanization measures into four distinct measures of settlement \"coherence\". For each coherence measure, greater mixing (i.e. incoherence) of the four categories was set to center on a value of zero, with more \"traditional\" settlement a mixture dominated by the least sophisticated (e.g. no toilet) of each response category valued at (\u22121), and the most \"modern\" settlements a mixture dominated by the most sophisticated (e.g. running water) of each response category valued at (+1). Working at the district level, Spencer plotted these three coherence indices, as well as a composite index combining the three, against the probability that a district in any of Vietnam's provinces (including cities) had an outbreak of HPAI in 2004 or 2005. After accounting for a minimal threshold effect of development, Spencer ( 2013 ) found a distinct Kuznets relationship exists between settlement coherence and HPAI. In particular, the sanitation coherence index explained over one third of variance in outbreaks (R-square = 0.37, bivariate), and the water supply coherence index explained over half (R-square = 0.56, bivariate). Overall, the fi ndings suggest that the urban infrastructure transition is associated with HPAI outbreaks in poultry and may be used as a general predictor of emerging infectious disease risk.",

This suggests that for the urbanization measure, at least those measures centered on water supply and sanitation, the basic function may be a Kuznets curve rather than a linear or a more complex curve. Our current project is conducting similar exercises for agricultural change and habitat alteration. We are developing transition indices for agricultural change and habitat alteration, plotting them against the probability of HPAI outbreak, and choosing the curve that best fi ts the data. A twice-changing slope as the best fi t would suggest a more complex fl uctuation of risk between traditional and modern landscapes, and a u-shaped curve would suggest that transitional landscapes are associated with reduced risk.",

Of the few studies that have examined determinants of HPAI risk perceptions, all have focused on perceived risk of HPAI to humans (rather than perceived risk to the health of poultry). Three studies conducted in Asian countries (de Zwart et al. 2007 ; Fielding et al. 2005 ; Figui\u00e9 and Fournier 2008 ) showed perceived human risk was correlated with demographics (women and older people perceived more risk) and effi cacy (perceived availability of protective actions and ability to engage in those actions led to lower perceived risk). In Laos, Barennes et al. ( 2007 ) reported that protective behavior was more likely with higher levels of education, urban living, knowledge of HPAI, and owning poultry. Only one of the above studies (Figui\u00e9 and Fournier 2008 ) was conducted in Vietnam. No studies have examined the relative importance of socio-ecological variables (urbanization, agricultural change, habitat alteration) versus socio-psychological variables (effi cacy, knowledge, affective response, risk avoidance, demographics) in determining perceptions of risk to the health of poultry. Moreover, no studies have examined whether risk perceptions and protective behaviors vary across traditional, transitional, and modern settings or with observed risk (poultry deaths).",

An analysis of EID risk that focuses only on socio-ecological variables will not reveal the socio-psychological differentiation of individuals who are more or less successful in responding to and managing EID outbreaks. Currently, however, there exists a gap in knowledge about the underlying mechanisms that explain variation in perceptions of the risk of EID and how these perceptions vary with social-ecological transition. Furthermore, most research on perceived risk has been done in democratic, Western countries, not in a context where there is tight state control of key institutions that interpret and disseminate disease risk information. To further understand how EID risk signals are processed by individuals in the context of CNH systems in Vietnam, we need to examine in depth the processes through which people collect and integrate data from natural and human systems. This work will advance basic knowledge about the complex linkages among ecological, social, and psychological variables that amplify or attenuate the intensity and frequency of EID.",

The second model postulates that correlations among the latent constructs can be explained by a higher-order factor. We can thus examine direct and indirect pathways between the latent constructs and HPAI outbreak. The dashed lines in Fig. 5 .2 represent the indirect pathways and higher-order factor, which we call CNH system Transition.",

Multiple regression analysis of these types of problems are subject to problems of interpretation that include covariances among interacting explanatory variables and an inability to assign unique explanatory capacity to individual factors (Grace and Bollen 2005 ; Laughlin and Abella 2007 ) . To avoid these problems, techniques such as structural equation modeling (SEM) may be most useful. SEM allows researchers to theorize about why explanatory variables are correlated and to build directional relationships into their models of systems. Explanatory variables are often correlated because they have a common cause or because one factor infl uences the other (Laughlin and Abella 2007 ; Shipley 2000 ) . These situations are common in observation studies of complex systems. Consequently a systems approach to the analysis and interpretation of composition in this CNH system may be optimal for explaining where driving forces interact to produce observed patterns of bird deaths across the landscape. We can not only explore the relationship between HPAI and urbanization, agricultural change, and habitat alteration at the national level, but also examine whether this relationship exists at commune and household scales using focus groups, interviews, and a structured household survey. This is necessary because as numerous researchers have shown, complexity is scale sensitive (Fox 1992 ; Phillips 1999 ; Walsh et al. 1999 ) . Processes that operate at one scale may not occur at other scales or resolutions.",

These differences of course have important implications for choices about the measures collected and analyzed.

We start by identifying three latent concepts for modernization-urbanization, agricultural intensifi cation and land use changes. For each of these concepts, we identify theories and metrics from diverse fi elds and then select those variables which seem to be valid for the type of transition happening in Vietnam. This list is shortened simply by eliminating variables for which high quality secondary data do not exist. The next step in the process is to realize that we are creating a comparative rather than an absolute metric of modernization. Even though the metric helps in the comparative assessment of the level of modernization, there is still a need to validate it based on ground-truthing. So then we use a multi-disciplinary approach to ground truthing-walk through fi eld surveys, random ground-level photographs, satellite imagery, commune data archives-to ensure that our classifi cation was at least accurate on an ordinal scale.",

Given that other researchers have already identifi ed the relevance of these components for explaining HPAI, we have some confi dence in our model as a starting point.
