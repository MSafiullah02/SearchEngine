Respiratory viral infections, in particular human rhinovirus (HRV) infection, represent the main causal factor.\n1\n An innate immune defect in asthmatic epithelium\n2\n can result in enhanced virus replication in virally induced asthma.\n3\n, \n4\n HRV, an RNA virus, is readily degraded by RNase activity and, consequently, shedding of HRV is typically expected to occur only briefly during a viral infection. The impaired interferon response in asthmatic epithelium that has been observed in vitro could result in delayed viral clearance,\n2\n and several reports have documented persistence of HRV nucleic acid in 44\u201350% of children, at 6 weeks after presentation to the emergency department with acute asthma\n5\n or wheezing.\n6\n Several studies have also reported detection of HRV nucleic acid in up to 35% of asymptomatic subjects.\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n The unexpected persistence of viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract of asthmatic children indicates a possible connection between viral infection and recurrent asthma. The clinical implications of these findings are unknown; however, airway hyperresponsiveness persists after virus infection in asthmatic children.",

Differences in viruses isolated at the two different visits occurred due to detection of RSV (n = 3) or influenza virus (n = 4) at either visit, and detection of a picornavirus at the alternate visit, or detection of an enterovirus at Visit 1 and a rhinovirus at Visit 2 (n = 2). Where the virus detected at recovery was able to infect a host cell line, we sequenced the viral VP 2/4 regions to determine the viral serotype. In one instance the same serotype was present at visits 1 and 2 (HRV\u201043); however at Visit 2, HRV\u201043 was detected in association with RSV type B. In another case the virus detected at recovery was a different serotype to the virus detected at the first visit: enterovirus 68 at Visit 1 and HRV 85 at Visit 2. Overall, eight of the 17 subjects with viral persistence at Visit 2 had isolates that were different to the virus detected during the acute asthma exacerbation.

The main virus detected during acute exacerbation is HRV, which has been shown to be present in 89% of cases of virus\u2010induced asthma.\n3\n In this study, we have shown that persistence of viral nucleic acid is common in asthmatics after an acute exacerbation and is associated with an altered cytokine environment, but no persistent clinical or inflammatory abnormality. The viral RNA observed most frequently to persist was HRV; however, persistence of the same infectious HRV was uncommon. When infectious virus was detected at recovery, it was often a different virus. The consequences of persistence of viral RNA were examined by assessing several disease domains. The clinical severity of the exacerbation and its recovery were similar whether there was clearance or persistence of viral RNA. In addition, the extent of cellular airway inflammation was similar between groups. However, viral persistence was associated with altered cytokine production, with elevated IL\u201010 and IP\u201010 gene expression. These results suggest that the cellular inflammation that results from viral replication is responsible for the clinical manifestations of a viral infection in asthma, rather than viral replication itself.",

In vitro RV culture has been shown to decline rapidly (over less than 2 days). In most experimental infections, RV shedding detected by virus culture reaches a peak around 48 h after viral challenge, then rapidly declines, remaining positive for up to 3 weeks.\n19\n Gern et al.\n20\n found that experimental RV infection cleared by 14 days in 50% of adults. In clinical samples, HRV RNA positivity has remained detectable longer than culture positivity. Among young adults with a common cold, PCR was positive after 7 days in 45% of cases.\n21\n Enteroviruses may be shed for up to 2 weeks from the nasopharynx and several months in faeces.\n22\n Asymptomatic carriage of HRV has been identified in 5\u201335% of subjects.\n9\n, \n23\n This could represent the early subclinical phase of a new infection, or viral persistence. In asymptomatic children with no past (4 weeks) or future (2 weeks) respiratory symptoms indicating a clinical infection, the viral detection rate was as low as 5%.\n9\n\n",

Measles virus persistence has been associated with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).\n24\n, \n25\n More recently persistent hepatitis C virus infection has been identified.\n25\n It has been suggested that several conditions must be met for viral persistence to occur. First, the virus should infect the cell without being cytopathic. The most common persistent virus in this study was HRV. HRV typically infects a host cell without causing cell death, and in asthma, apoptosis is suppressed after HRV infection.\n2\n, \n4\n Second, the viral genome must be maintained. For those RNA viruses that do not integrate into the host genome, such as HRV, continued replication at a low level is required to maintain infection. This has been shown to occur with RSV where gene transcription continues after the acute infection.\n26\n Third, the virus must avoid immune detection and elimination. Although specific antibodies to HRV develop after infection, their ability to protect against infection can be limited. After RSV infection, viral persistence can occur despite the presence of virus\u2010specific IgG.\n26\n Effective T\u2010cell responses are critical to eradicate acute viral infections and prevent viral persistence. It has recently been shown that virus\u2010specific CD4 T cells can be functionally inactivated early during the transition into viral persistence and fail to produce effector cytokines, thereby compromising an efficient and effective antiviral immune response.\n27\n If these mechanisms were to occur after HRV infection, this could lead to viral persistence.",

Future identification of these responses could be very important. Viral persistence was associated with altered cytokine responses, with an ongoing elevation of IL\u201010 and IP\u201010 gene expression.
