            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Gammacoronaviridae, order Nidovirales, is an important pathogen that infects domestic chickens of all ages, causing an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease (Cavanagh and Gelb Jr., 2008). The IBV genome contains a single positive-strand RNA molecule, which is about 27.6 kb long and which has a cap at its 5\u2032 end and a poly (A) tail at its 3\u2032 end (Boursnell et al., 1987). The genome of IBV comprises ten open reading frames (ORFs), and the first 20 kb of the genome is made up of ORF1, which is a replicase gene. The replicase has two ORFs, 1a and 1b, and 1b is produced as a 1ab polyprotein by a \u22121 ribosomal frame-shifting mechanism. ORF1 encodes 15 non-structural proteins associated with RNA replication and transcription. The IBV genome encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). In addition, IBV has other genes that encode for proteins interspersed among structural genes, namely 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b (Boursnell et al., 1987).",

            "text": "Numerous serotypes have been described for IBV thus far, as frequent point mutations occur in the S1 domain of the S gene of the virus. Another important feature of IBV, as well as other coronaviruses, is the high rate of homologous and non-homologous RNA\u2013RNA recombination that has been demonstrated to occur among selected and unselected markers during the course of infection (Masters, 2006). RNA recombination in coronaviruses is thought to result from a copy-choice mechanism (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986). In this scheme, the viral polymerase, with its nascent RNA strand intact, detaches from one template and resumes elongation at the identical position, or a similar position, on another template. Although strong selective pressures are able to create the appearance of local clustering of recombinational hot spots (Banner et al., 1990), the sites of recombination are considered to be random (Banner and Lai, 1991). Because homologous recombination can occur between genomic and subgenomic RNAs, with the latter providing a source of donor and acceptor templates that become more numerous as a function of proximity to the 3\u2032 end of the genome, the rate of recombination increases from the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 end of the coronavirus genome, (Masters, 2006).",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence suggests that recombination is an inherent component in IBV evolution, and it is believed that recombination events can occur in the field under the following conditions: when there are extremely large numbers of chickens, especially when kept at high density; when the virus is easily spread; and when there is a co-circulation of serotypes, including proof of co-infection with more than one serotype in a given flock (Cavanagh, 2007). The circumstantial evidence for recombination, derived from gene sequence comparisons, has shown that the recombination events had occurred a very long time ago. However, it was shown that recombination in the S1 domain of the S protein of the IBV genome is a mechanism that leads to the emergence of new IBV strains, and it could be responsible for changes in viral pathogenicity and replication in a single generation (Hewson et al., 2014). In general, it is difficult to ascertain what effect recombination has on the serotype, pathogenicity, virulence, and tissue tropism of recombinant strains using only gene sequence analyses. Serotyping and animal studies, paired with differential analyses of genes, genomic sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses, will be essential to provide insights into the altered characteristics of recombinant IBV strains and their effect on poultry health.",

One-day-old chickens were vaccinated against IBV with the live attenuated H120 vaccine, and 15-day-old chickens boosted with Ma5 live vaccines. Some of the chickens showed early clinical signs, including listlessness, huddling, and ruffled feathers, when they were 20 days old. On day 25, some of the diseased chickens began to die, and gross examinations showed mild to severe tracheitis, nephritis, and proventriculitis.

The results demonstrated that all of the chickens developed clinical signs and that two chickens died at 5 and 6 days post-challenge. Meanwhile, all chickens were positive for virus re-isolation 4 and 8 days post-challenge, suggesting that H120 vaccination could not provide protection against the IBV strain tl/CH/LDT3/03. In accordance with our previous results (Liu et al., 2005), the IBV strain tl/CH/LDT3/03 was highly pathogenic to SPF chickens, as it resulted in 100% morbidity and 30% mortality (Table 4). In contrast, only a small proportion of chickens (20%) developed mild clinical signs at about 4\u201310 days after ck/CH/LGX/130530 challenge. All challenged chickens survived through the entire observation period of 25 days. None of the chicks challenged with the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate showed seroconversion at 4 days post-challenge, but antibodies were detected by ELISA in nearly all of the birds after 8 days post-challenge.",

It had been reported that the Canadian Qu_mv strain originated from a recombination event between Massachusetts and Arkansas-like strains (Smati et al., 2002). California 99-like viruses presumably originated from multiple recombination events between Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Arkansas vaccines (Mondal and Cardona, 2007). In the course of our continuous surveillance of IBV in China, several natural recombinant IBV strains have been isolated and identified. These IBV strains were shown to have originated from recombination events between field and vaccine strains, different types of vaccine strains, or different types of field strains (Liu et al., 2013a, Liu et al., 2013b, Liu et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2015). Some of the recombinant strains were shown to have undergone multiple recombination events (Liu et al., 2013b, Liu et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2015). In addition, other reports in China also confirmed our results (Zhao et al., 2013, Feng et al., 2014, Zhou et al., 2014), indicating that recombination played an important role in the course of IBV evolution in China. In this study, we isolated and identified an IBV isolate, ck/CH/LGX/130530, that likely originated from a recombination event between a Massachusetts-type H120-like strain and a field tl/CH/LDT3/03-like strain, as shown by SimPlot analyses, pairwise comparisons, and similarity comparisons using corresponding gene fragments.",

The tl/CH/LDT3/03-like viruses were also isolated and shown to be one of the major types of viruses circulating in H120-vaccinated chicken flocks in southern China, including Guangxi province, in recent years (Luo et al., 2012, Feng et al., 2014). The company at which ck/CH/LGX/130530 was isolated had more than a 20-year history of chicken breeding, and it had used the H120 vaccine against IBV for more than 15 years. It has been showed that the H120 vaccine strain may persist in various internal organs of chickens for 163 days or longer (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). Therefore, recombination events between the H120 vaccine and field strains may lead to the creation of a new virus, such as the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolated in the present study, although we cannot exclude the possibility that this isolate was introduced from other regions. However, previous studies showed that the viruses of tl/CH/LDT3/03 genotype had been isolated in the chicken flocks of the company (Li et al., 2012, Li et al., 2013) although it was not the flock in which ck/CH/LGX/130530 had been isolated, implicating that recombination event had been likely occurred in this company. The results showed that H120-like sequences in the genome of the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate had less than 99.8% similarity to those of the H120 vaccine, and similarly, the tl/CH/LDT3/03-like sequences of the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate had about 99.7% similarity to those of the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain. These results imply that there has been a recent recombination event, causing near homogenization of certain genomic regions between two highly diverged viruses. Moreover, the occurrence of such events suggests an important role for recombination between a pathogenic field IBV strain and the vaccine strain.",

However, we found that the tl/CH/LDT3/03 challenge virus could be re-isolated from 100% of the H120-vaccinated SPF chickens at 4 and 8 days post-challenge, indicating that the tl/CH/LDT3/03 virus could replicate and be shed via the oropharynx from the H120-vaccinated chickens at least eight days after infection. Therefore, it is possible that a tl/CH/LDT3/03-like virus and the H120 vaccine strain could co-exist in a certain chicken flock, which would make such a recombination event possible.",

This can largely account for the observed results that the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate was shown to be serotypically close to tl/CH/LDT3/03 by a cross-neutralization test. In addition, vaccination with the LDT3-A vaccine, which was derived from a tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain by serial passaging in chicken eggs, provided good protection against the ck/CH/LGX/130530 challenge, indicating that they belonged to the same protectotype (de Wit et al., 2011a, de Wit et al., 2011b). Consequently, the recombination event that possibly occurred in the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate did not result in changes in the genotype, serotype, and protectotype, as compared to those of one of its parental viruses, tl/CH/LDT3/03, as the extent of the similarity between the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate and its other parental virus, the H120 strain, was greater than 99.8% in the 5\u2032 end of the Gene 1 region, which is 17,000 nt long.",

The nucleotide sequences of the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate from genome position 17,055 to the 3\u2032 end of the genome were shown to be derived from a tl/CH/LDT3/03-like virus (as it shared more than 99.7% nucleotide identity in this region); this region included a part of nsp14, and complete nsp15 and nsp16 of the Gene 1 region, the M, N, and S genes, Gene3, Gene5, and the 3\u2032 UTR. The remaining sequences were likely derived from the attenuated H120 vaccine strain. It was previously demonstrated that the accessory protein genes of IBV contributed to virulence (Shen et al., 2003, Youn et al., 2005). However, replacing the complete replicase gene of the pathogenic IBV M41 strain with that of a non-pathogenic Beaudette-derived gene demonstrated that the IBV replicase gene is a determinant of pathogenicity (Armesto et al., 2009). This was also observed in another coronavirus, which led to the belief that changes within the replicase gene, especially the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that constitutes the core of viral replicases, can change the replicase fidelity, as in the vast majority of cases, the alterations in replication fidelity decreased viral fitness and attenuated virulence (Smith et al., 2014, Smith et al., 2015). Our results confirmed that the replicase gene was associated with viral pathogenicity although this observation for the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate needs to be verified by future reverse genetic and animal studies.",
