            "text": "In the past 15 years, nidovirus research has been driven forward in particular by the emergence of two life-threatening CoVs in humans, the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which most likely originate from bats and were introduced by zoonotic transfer from intermediate hosts, civet cats and dromedary camels for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively (Ge et al., 2013, Hu et al., 2015, Menachery et al., 2015). Of note, the presence of neutralizing antibodies in camels suggests that MERS-CoV or related viruses may have been present in this reservoir for decades (Hu et al., 2015). The short-lived SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002\u20132003 resulted in 8098 reported cases leading to 774 deaths, while affecting 29 countries (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). Between its emergence in 2012 and March 2018, MERS-CoV has caused > 2100 laboratory-confirmed human infections and at least 750 deaths (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). The clinical presentation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV ranges from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to acute respiratory disease, in the case of SARS originally described as an \u201catypical pneumonia\u201d accompanied by fever and severe respiratory distress (Hui et al., 2014). The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks greatly augmented the interest in the CoV family, although human CoVs had already been known since the 1960's, when HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were identified. These two viruses are known to cause mild respiratory disease and, after rhinoviruses, are a leading cause of common colds (10\u201315% of the cases; reviewed in Wat, 2004). More recently, two additional HCoVs were discovered, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, which again are associated with respiratory disease (reviewed in Pyrc et al., 2007).",

Likewise, ronivirus infections have done significant damage in the Asian shrimp farming industry (Flegel, 2012).

            "text": "The conserved genome organization and expression strategy of nidoviruses includes the translation of two large replicase open reading frames (ORFs 1a and 1b) from the genomic RNA. This yields the replicase polyprotein (pp) 1a and, following a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift, the C-terminally extended pp1ab. The two polyproteins are proteolytically processed by multiple internal proteases to liberate (in the case of arteri- and coronaviruses) at least 13\u201316 nonstructural proteins (nsps). Among these nsps are subunits containing RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and helicase functions, key players in the enzyme complex responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Together with recruited host cell proteins, nidovirus nsps form membrane-associated replication and transcription complexes (Gosert et al., 2002, Hagemeijer et al., 2012, Pedersen et al., 1999, van Hemert et al., 2008a, van Hemert et al., 2008b) that localize to a network of virus-induced structures, typically including double-membrane vesicles, in the perinuclear region of the infected cell (reviewed in de Wilde et al., 2017b; Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2016; van der Hoeven et al., 2016). A nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs is produced to express the structural and accessory proteins that are encoded downstream of the nidovirus replicase gene (Pasternak et al., 2006, Sawicki et al., 2007, Snijder et al., 2013, Sola et al., 2011). Despite these common features of viruses in the order Nidovirales, the various nidovirus taxa differ strikingly in the type, number, and size of their structural proteins, which also explains the observed variation in virion structure and morphology.",

            "text": "The recent outbreaks of emerging nidoviruses inspired extensive studies of their epidemiology and pathogenesis, and underlined the importance of developing prophylactic and therapeutic options, including vaccines and drugs targeting either viral functions or host factors recruited to support nidovirus replication. In this context, the inhibition of a range of RNA viruses by cyclophilin (Cyp) inhibitors (Hopkins and Gallay, 2015) prompted several research teams to investigate their impact on nidovirus replication, mainly for coronaviruses and - to a lesser extent \u2013 for arteriviruses. Below we will first describe the key features of members of the Cyp family and then summarize our current knowledge regarding their involvement in nidovirus replication. This includes the anti-nidoviral effect of cyclosporin A (CsA), the best known Cyp inhibitor (Borel et al., 1976, Handschumacher et al., 1984), and several of its non-immunosuppressive analogs. Finally, our current knowledge on the involvement of Cyps in the replication of other RNA viral pathogens is summarized, to illustrate the wide variety of mechanisms by which this common host factor can be involved in supporting viral replication.",

It is one of the most abundant proteins in the cytoplasm (0.1\u20130.4% of total protein content) and is expressed in all tissues (Harding et al., 1986, Ryffel et al., 1991). In the cytosol, CypA plays a role in a broad range of cellular functions, like facilitating protein folding, protein trafficking, T-cell activation, and cell signaling (reviewed in Naoumov, 2014; Nigro et al., 2013). Although CypA normally is an intracellular protein, inflammatory stimuli like infections, hypoxia, or oxidative stress can elicit CypA secretion via a vesicular transport mechanism that depends on Rho kinase activation (reviewed in Bukrinsky, 2015). CypA proved to be non-essential for cell growth as depletion of CypA in cells or in PPIA-/- knockout mice did not affect survival and/or growth kinetics (Chatterji et al., 2009, Colgan et al., 2005, de Wilde et al., 2017c).",

N-terminally truncated CypB is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli, although the mechanism by which CypB is cleaved is currently unclear (reviewed in Bukrinsky, 2015). In addition, binding of CsA to the CsA-binding site in CypB induces the release of CypB from the ER via the secretory pathway. It has been hypothesized that this binding of CsA interferes with a functional interaction of CypB with other ER-associated proteins that normally retains CypB ER-associated (Fearon et al., 2011, Price et al., 1994).",

CsA, isolated from the soil fungus Tolypcladium inflatum, is a lipophilic, neutral, cyclic endecapeptide (Borel et al., 1976). FK-506 (or Tacrolimus) was isolated from Streptomyces tsukubaensis and is functionally but not structurally related to CsA (Goto et al., 1987). The immunosuppressive properties of CsA and FK-506 depend on complex formation with Cyps and FKBP12, respectively. In turn, these complexes sequester and inhibit calcineurin, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is a key player in T cell activation (Liu et al., 1991). The interaction with calcineurin inhibits the phosphatase activity of the latter enzyme, which prevents the nuclear translocation of its substrate nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and consequently the expression of immune genes like IL-2 and IL-4 (Liu et al., 1991). In this manner, CsA and FK-506 suppress the activation of cytotoxic and helper T cells (Ho et al., 1996, Schreiber and Crabtree, 1992, reviewed in Martinez-Martinez and Redondo, 2004). These drugs proved to be suitable immunosuppressive agents due to the absence of the toxicity commonly associated with other fungus-derived immunosuppressive pharmaceuticals. Subsequently, CsA also revolutionized the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, as well as various dermatological diseases (reviewed in Hopkins and Gallay, 2015).",

To address this issue, a variety of CsA analogs that do bind Cyps without inducing immunosuppression have been engineered. These second-generation Cyp inhibitors include Alisporivir (ALV; or Debio-025) (Landrieu et al., 2010, Paeshuyse et al., 2006), NIM811 (Ciechomska et al., 2005), and SCY-635 (Hopkins et al., 2010). These compounds have been modified to abolish their affinity for calcineurin, while increasing their affinity for Cyps. As a result, these non-immunosuppressive CsA analogs are more potent inhibitors of the interactions of Cyps with (viral) proteins, while their administration does no longer lead to inhibition of NF-AT signaling, as calcineurin's phosphatase activity is not inhibited. Therefore, these drugs have become critical tools to study Cyp functions, cellular signaling pathways, and/or interactions of Cyps that are relevant for viral replication (as discussed in this review). Also, most of these CsA analogs have been explored as antiviral drugs (reviewed in Frausto et al., 2013; Hopkins and Gallay, 2015).",

Notably, for some CoVs variable antiviral effects were observed in different cell types, including Huh7 cells and various Vero cell subtypes, with e.g. the antiviral effect of ALV against SARS-CoV being less pronounced in Vero-E6 cells than in another Vero cell subclone (de Wilde et al., 2017a). The reasons for these variations in antiviral effects are poorly understood, but may include variations in drug uptake, Cyp expression levels, and/or the overall kinetics of virus replication in a particular cell line.",

This failure could be taken as a first sign that Cyp inhibitors may not be useful for the clinical treatment of CoV infections. It is clear, however, that this conclusion first needs to be corroborated in further studies, also including other compounds and other coronavirus (or nidovirus) models. This might more rigorously establish whether currently used Cyp inhibitors are worth pursuing, either directly or as leads for the development of other host-directed antiviral drugs. Furthermore, the development of non-immunosuppressive Cyp inhibitors with increased potency, solubility, or drug plasma levels may enhance the antiviral activity in vivo. In any case, the use of Cyp inhibitors in fundamental research may still help to uncover the putative role of Cyps in the replication of CoVs and other nidoviruses, as will be discussed below. Also, a summary of the (putative) roles of Cyps in nidovirus replication is depicted in\nFig. 1.",

In 2004, seven years before the first reports on the inhibition of nidovirus replication by Cyp inhibitors, Luo et al. (2004) already suggested CypA to be an interaction partner of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein after using surface plasmon resonance to measure the binding affinity of purified SARS-CoV N protein and CypA. In a follow-up study, co-immunoprecipitation of purified CypA with SARS-CoV N protein confirmed the interaction of the two proteins (Chen et al., 2005). Using a similar co-immunoprecipitation approach, CypA was also shown to bind to cellular CD147, which is present on the plasma membrane. It was postulated that a CD147-CypA-N complex could promote SARS-CoV entry (Chen et al., 2005), although the formation of this tri-partite protein complex was not demonstrated. Moreover, a conceptual difficulty is that, during virus entry, the putative virion-associated CypA-N protein complex would be physically separated from CD147 by the viral envelope, and consequently it is difficult to envisage an interaction between these two proteins. Using a mass-spectrometry-based approach, Neuman et al. (2008) confirmed the presence of CypA in SARS-CoV virions, although no function was proposed for virion-associated CypA.",

Subsequently, the importance of CypA as a host factor in CoV replication was further substantiated using knockdown or knockout of CypA expression, which was achieved using a variety of approaches. In Caco-2 and Huh7.5 cells, shRNA-mediated knockdown of CypA mRNA expression to below 3% of the normal levels was reported to nearly completely block HCoV-NL63 replication (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2014) and reduce HCoV-229E-driven luciferase expression by 10- to 20-fold (von Brunn et al., 2015). CypA- or CypB-knockout in feline fcwf-4 cells resulted in a near-complete block of FCoV replication. Interestingly, in the parental fcwf-4 cells shRNA-mediated knockdown of CypA and CypB only marginally reduced FCoV replication, suggesting that relatively small amounts of CypA and CypB may suffice to support normal levels of FCoV replication. Transient overexpression of PPIase-defective CypA or CypB mutants in parental fcwf-4 cells (still expressing endogenous CypA and CypB) slightly reduced replication, suggesting that PPIase activity of CypA and CypB is relevant for FCoV replication (Tanaka et al., 2017).",

The involvement of Pin1 in HIV-1 infection is distinct from its role in HCV replication: HIV-1 infection induces Pin1 phosphorylation that in turn reduced expression and virion association of APOBEC3G, a known HIV-1 restriction factor (Watashi et al., 2008).

In line with the inhibitory effect of CsA treatment on CoV replication in cell culture, the replication of the arteriviruses EAV and PRRSV was found to be inhibited in the presence of low-micromolar concentrations of CsA and Debio-064, another non-immunosuppressive CsA analog. Interestingly, with EC50 values below 1 \u00b5M, replication of EAV was the most sensitive among all nidoviruses tested so far (de Wilde et al., 2013a), suggesting that EAV depends most strongly on Cyps for its replication. Both drugs prevented viral protein expression in arterivirus-infected cells and reduced virus yields by 4 logs (de Wilde et al., 2013a). Likewise, both compounds blocked in vitro RNA synthesis in assays using semi-purified replication structures from EAV-infected cells, pointing towards direct inhibition of viral RNA synthesis. In CsA-resistant EAV mutants, selected by serial passaging in the presence of the compound, mutations primarily mapped to nsp5, a multispanning membrane-associated subunit of the viral replicase. In addition, in vitro RNA synthesis activity of replication complexes prepared from cells infected with CsA-resistant EAV is indeed insensitive to CsA treatment (de Wilde et al., manuscript in preparation). The role of nsp5 in arterivirus replication is poorly understood, but the protein has been suggested to play a role in fine-tuning the conversion of intracellular membranes into viral replication organelles (van der Hoeven et al., 2016).",

The presence of CypA, but not its PPIase activity (de Wilde et al., manuscript in preparation), was indeed shown to be pivotal for EAV replication (de Wilde et al., 2013a) as knockout of CypA expression resulted in a 3-log reduction of EAV progeny yields. Replication was affected much less strongly in cells expressing reduced levels of CypA (de Wilde et al., 2013a, de Wilde et al., 2017c), again highlighting that small amounts of CypA may suffice to support efficient nidovirus replication (see above). Collectively, these observations indicate that CypA is an essential host factor that binds to arterivirus replication organelles and supports RNA synthesis (Fig. 1). The inhibition of EAV RNA synthesis by CsA treatment suggests that CypA has a direct role in this process, rather than being involved in the formation of replication organelles, which is in contrast to what has been reported for HCV (Chatterji et al., 2015, Madan et al., 2014) (see below).",

            "text": "During HIV-1 infection, CypA plays a role in the disassembly stage of the HIV-1 capsid core and the nuclear import of the reverse-transcribed HIV-1 genome. However, the molecular details of this process remain poorly understood. CypA binds the capsid core by interacting with capsid protein (CA) monomers that enclose the viral genome. In general, it is believed that in this way CypA ensures that the HIV-1 genome, which following entry is reverse-transcribed into cDNA inside these capsid cores, reaches the nucleus before it is sensed by the immune system (reviewed in Campbell and Hope, 2015; Hopkins and Gallay, 2015). CsA and NIM-811 were shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication in human T cells by disrupting this CA-CypA interaction (Billich et al., 1995, Franke and Luban, 1996). The hydrophobic pocket of CypA interacts with CA to catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of the Gly89\u2013Pro90 peptide bond, which induces a conformational change in HIV-1 CA (Bosco et al., 2002, Franke et al., 1994, Gamble et al., 1996, Thali et al., 1994). This event is thought to trigger the disassembly of the HIV-1 capsid core, although the available data is conflicting. Some researchers indeed showed that CypA binds CA to destabilize the capsid core (Fricke et al., 2013), while others found that CypA stabilizes the capsid core (Shah et al., 2013). A third study suggests that this discrepancy may be caused by concentration differences, with low amounts of CypA stabilizing the core and high levels leading to its disassembly (Liu et al., 2016).",

This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that (New-World) owl monkey cells express a TRIM5-CypA fusion protein, in which the TRIM5\u03b1 SPRY domain has been replaced with CypA. The CypA domain of this fusion protein directs the TRIM5\u03b1 domain to the HIV-1 capsid core to restrict HIV-1 replication. Also, in contrast to the inhibition of HIV-1 infection by CsA in human T cells, treatment of owl monkey cells with this Cyp inhibitor enhanced HIV-1 replication. This increased replication efficiency is presumably mediated by a block of the TRIM5-CypA interaction with the HIV-1 CA (Nisole et al., 2004, Sayah et al., 2004).",

            "text": "After reports on the potent inhibition of HCV replication in hepatocytes by CsA (Nakagawa et al., 2004, Watashi et al., 2003), CypA was identified as an essential host factor for HCV replication (Chatterji et al., 2009, Kaul et al., 2009, Nakagawa et al., 2005a, Yang et al., 2008). Its importance was further substantiated by the observation that HCV infection was restricted in CypA-knockout mice (Dorner et al., 2013). Subsequently, several key observations were made during studies aiming to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which CypA regulates HCV replication (for excellent reviews, see Hopkins and Gallay, 2015; Lin and Gallay, 2013):i.Inactivation of CypA's PPIase activity by mutagenesis revealed that this enzymatic activity is pivotal for efficient HCV replication in cell culture (Chatterji et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2009b);ii.CypA interacts directly with the HCV replication complex by binding to NS5A. Multiple proline residues located in NS5A domains II and III are determinants of CypA binding and are substrates for its PPIase activity (Fernandes et al., 2010, Foster et al., 2011, Hanoulle et al., 2009, Shirota et al., 2002). Binding of CypA to NS5A domain II induces conformational changes in this domain that favor RNA binding and NS5A-NS5B interactions (Foster et al., 2011, Ngure et al., 2016);iii.Resistance to Cyp inhibitors requires mutations in NS5A (Coelmont et al., 2010, Garcia-Rivera et al., 2012, Kaul et al., 2009). The NS5A D320E mutation is assumed to contribute most to resistance and facilitates CypA-independent replication of HCV (Coelmont et al., 2010);iv.There is growing evidence that the CypA-NS5A interaction is not directly linked to the RNA-synthesizing activity of the HCV replication complex, but merely is involved in the formation and stabilization of the HCV-induced membranous web (replication organelle) with which the replication complex is associated (Chatterji et al., 2015, Madan et al., 2014).\n",

In the case of WNV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), the inhibitory effect of CsA was attributed to blocking a functional CypA-NS5 interaction (Qing et al., 2009), while CypA was shown to interact with NS4B during YFV infection (Vidotto et al., 2017). Interestingly, JEV seems to depend mainly on enzymatically active CypB for its replication, mostly via an interaction with NS4A (Kambara et al., 2011).",

The multifunctional matrix (M1) protein is involved in various stages of the virus replication cycle. CypA interacts with the M1 protein to accelerate its degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway (Liu et al., 2009a, Liu et al., 2012b). Overexpression of CypA in transgenic mice reduced influenza virus replication (Li et al., 2016). Furthermore, influenza A virus infection of macrophages isolated from these CypA-overexpressing mice showed an upregulation of host antiviral genes compared to macrophages from wild-type C57BL/6 mice. This upregulation may likely contribute to resistance of influenza virus infection in mice (Li et al., 2016).",

Cyps were demonstrated to play a multifaceted role in the replication of a range of RNA viruses, which was investigated in most detail for HIV-1 and HCV. The key role of Cyps in the viral life cycle has been demonstrated by a wide variety of techniques, including the use of cells or mice partially or completely depleted for specific Cyps, by complementation studies with PPIase-deficient Cyp proteins or mutant viral proteins that are unable to interact with Cyps, using (non-)immunosuppressive Cyp inhibitors, and by the analysis of drug-resistant viruses.",

            "text": "For most viruses, CypA is believed to be the main Cyp involved in virus replication, but its specific mode of action in virus replication appears to differ greatly among viruses. For instance, CypA is believed to bind the HIV-1 CA to ensure that the reverse-transcribed HIV-1 genome reaches the nucleus before it is sensed by the immune system, while during HCV infection CypA is involved in the generation of virus-induced replication organelles and/or the proper folding of HCV proteins that interact with viral RNA or other viral proteins. Current data from others and our laboratory suggest a diverse role of Cyps, and especially CypA, in nidovirus replication. For example, CypA has been hypothesized to be incorporated into SARS-CoV virions (Neuman et al., 2008), which may suggest \u2013 for reasons that are not fully understood at the moment \u2013 that CypA's chaperone function enhances the infectivity of SARS-CoV. Pfefferle et al. (2011) reported that a variety of Cyps, including CypA, is able to modulate NF-AT signaling in SARS-CoV-infected cells by interacting with SARS-CoV nsp1. However, the relevance of these results in the context of the viral replication cycle is currently unclear, as non-immunosuppressive analogs do not interfere with NF-AT signaling but do inhibit SARS-CoV replication.",

In any case, the mechanistic details of the interactions of nidoviral proteins and Cyps remain to be resolved, which may also provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches for other (nido)viruses that recruit Cyps as a host factor in their replication.",
