After a pathogen breaches the host's physical barriers such as mucosal surfaces or skin, cells of the innate immune system can recognize general characteristics of the pathogen and initiate a response.3 Pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are molecules that are common to many pathogens, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which can be found on the cell wall of many bacterial species, double\u2010stranded RNA or unmethylated CpG motifs, which are normally associated with virus infection. PAMPs can be recognized by Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern\u2010recognition receptors (PRRs) which are present on the surface of host cells.4 The intrinsic properties of multivalent display and highly ordered structure present in many pathogens also facilitate recognition by PAMPs, resulting in increased immunogenicity. PAMPs stimulate antigen uptake by antigen presenting cells and the subsequent presentation of antigens to cells of the adaptive immune response. Furthermore the initial response by polymorphonuclear (PMNs) leukocytes, granulocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells induces the release of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines that promote elimination of pathogens.",

Adaptive responses require the recognition of the pathogen by host lymphocytes through interaction of cell\u2010surface receptors that are unique to the lymphocyte. An enormous repertoire of possible receptor combinations allows for the recognition of almost any antigen presented.5 Once the antigen is delivered to the adaptive immune system and stimulates the proliferation of antigen\u2010specific effector cells, these cells begin eliminating the pathogen. The adaptive response is also the basis for immunological memory, which is important for ensuring a fast, strong response when an infectious pathogen is encountered again.6 Memory lymphocytes can form subsequent initiation for a rapid and immediate immune response upon reintroduction of the pathogen. Vaccines capitalize on immune memory by stimulating the formation of memory B\u2010 and T\u2010 cells and specific antibodies to a pathogen, which are then available to rapidly recognize the natural pathogen during future exposures. The ideal vaccine utilizes this process by introducing the immune system to a specific pathogen and allowing the formation of memory cells for future recognition, yet avoiding symptoms, illness, or transmission of the pathogen to other individuals.",

An advance in this area involves the natural ability of many types of viral capsid subunits to self\u2010assemble into virus\u2010like particles (VLPs), which allows for a better mimic of the whole virus particle, and a resulting improvement in effectiveness as vaccines (Figure 2).18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Further advances utilize the VLP as a platform for the attachment or display of foreign epitopes such as nonstructural viral proteins or nonviral proteins. This strategy couples delivery of the chosen antigen with the ability of the VLP to induce strong immune responses. The ease with which VLPs are often made and various antigens are attached to them makes every potential platform promising from onset.

HBV infection is transmitted by blood or sexual contact, and is a major cause of hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide. In the initial vaccine formulation, empty particles of small HBV\u2010derived surface antigen (HBsAg) that are naturally made during infection with hepatitis B and are present in the blood, were obtained from infected individuals and purified. The limited quantity of antigen produced by this method led to investigation of the potential for making the particles by recombinant protein expression. Expression systems in yeast, baculovirus, and mammalian cells are often utilized because these cultures can produce large amounts of proteins in vitro. In the case of HBV, vectors were prepared carrying the cDNA sequence for HBsAg, and the surface antigen proteins were expressed in recombinant yeast cell culture and VLPs formed by self\u2010assembly.25 Further studies confirmed the immunogenicity of these particles in human vaccination.26 Inclusion of surface proteins (preS1 and preS2 proteins), which are present in the native HBV envelope at lower levels than in HBsAg, allows for immune responses in the small percentage of patients who do not respond to VLPs of HBsAg alone.27, 28, 29 In this case, the better mimic of the authentic virion surface results in broadened effectiveness. The commercially successful vaccine, licensed in 1986, is a safe and effective example to which other vaccines are compared. The effectiveness of this vaccine has facilitated exploration into more complex issues such as administration in poorer countries where HBV is an epidemic and application of the current vaccine is limited due to cost. The most recent advances have tested the possibility of oral delivery of HBV particles that are produced in transgenic plants.30\n",

An effective HPV vaccine is of particular interest because of the link of HPV infection, particularly genotypes HPV\u201016 and HPV\u201018, to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cervical cancer).31, 32, 33 The HPV capsid consists of two proteins, L1 and L2. Expression of the L1 major capsid protein of HPV16, either alone or in combination with L2 resulted in the production of 40 nm VLPs that induced high\u2010titer neutralizing antisera in rabbits.34,35 Immunizations in human females demonstrated that the HPV vaccine protected them from infection with HPV, and also reduced or prevented entirely the development of intraepithelial neoplasia. Of the control patients who received placebo, a subset was infected with HPV and some developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The current HPV vaccine shows great promise, as it is almost completely protective against HPV types from which it is derived even in the absence of an adjuvant, and with adjuvant achieves partial protection against other phylogenetically related types.36 This VLP vaccine is considered a breakthrough for preventing cervical cancer, and it will be interesting to observe the impact of the vaccine on cervical cancer rates in the future. Since HPV\u201016 has also recently been associated with oropharyngeal cancer,37 vaccination may impact the future rates of this disease as well. As with the HBV vaccine, production and characterization of VLPs is expensive and results in higher vaccine costs. Approaches to reduce costs by expressing the L1 protein as pentameric capsomeres, or in combinations with other viral proteins, are being explored.36\n",

On the surface, a VLP vaccine may be at a disadvantage compared to current replication\u2010based vaccine strategies because HIV\u20101 VLPs are similar to the wild\u2010type viral structure, which does not elicit a protective response in infected individuals. However, modifications in the HIV VLP could advance this strategy. In addition, mucosal administration of the particles elicits strong neutralizing antibody and CTL responses.50 Efficient induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies is thought to be an essential component for inducing protection. Nevertheless, while such antibodies have been identified in a small subset of HIV\u2010infected patients, it is not yet possible to induce such antibodies experimentally. One significant challenge is the difficulty of producing antigens that are structurally similar to those found on the intact HIV particles. The production of an HIV VLP that confronts this problem has been attempted by mimicking the intact HIV particle containing the envelope proteins that associate with the viral gag protein core.50, 51, 52 The focus of recent research has been on the more conserved epitopes of the HIV\u20101 gp\u201041 envelope protein.53 Nevertheless the challenge of an efficient HIV vaccine will require further manipulation of the different VLPs and expression systems available.",

To capitalize on this feature, FHV particles displaying large protein insertions were developed to potentially function as both, an antitoxin and vaccine for Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. Two enzymatic A subunits of the AB type toxin of B. anthracis are responsible for the toxic effects. These are delivered to the cell by binding to the B subunit, termed protective antigen (PA) that binds to cell\u2010surface receptors ANTXR1 and ANTXR2. The adenylate cyclase edema factor (EF) raises intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, and the zinc protease lethal factor (LF) cleaves mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase kinases.65 Once PA binds to ANTXR1 or 2, it is cleaved to form heptamers that bind EF and LF to form edema toxin and lethal toxin, respectively. The FHV particles were genetically engineered to display the PA\u2010binding domain of anthrax receptor ANTXR2 at position 206 or 264, and the binding domain was deemed functional by its ability to bind PA and inhibit PA\u2010cellular receptor binding and intoxication in vitro and in vivo. Since they could bind PA, the FHV\u2013ANTXR2 particles were then tested as a multivalent scaffold for displaying the antigenic PA protein. Following immunization with the FHV\u2013ANTXR2\u2013PA complex, strong toxin\u2010neutralizing antibody response along with protection against lethal toxin challenge in rats confirmed the dual\u2010action ability for treatment and protection.65 Interestingly, increased antibody responses and protection were observed following immunization multivalent FHV\u2013ANTXR2\u2013PA compared to monomeric PA alone (Figure 3(E) and (F)). In addition, protective responses were observed after a single immunization without additional adjuvants. These results further confirm the idea that multivalency of antigen presentation facilitates effective antibody responses.
