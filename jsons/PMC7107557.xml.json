            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSV), which belong to the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales, are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (Cavanagh 1997). PRRSV recently emerged in the domesticated swine and are recognized as the most important infectious agents causing reproductive failure in sows and severe pneumonia in piglets (Rossow et al. 1999). The first case of possible PRRSV infection with the above symptoms was reported in North America in the mid-1980s (Keffaber 1989; Ellis et al. 1999), and similar symptoms spread to other continents (Asia and Europe) by 1991 (Albina 1997; Ellis et al. 1999). In 1991, two strains of PRRSV were first isolated independently in the United States and the Netherlands (Wensvoort et al. 1991; Collins et al. 1992). The U.S. and Netherlands isolates are considered to be the reference strains of the American type (PRRSV-A) and European type (PRRSV-E), respectively. Currently, PRRSV-A is prevalent in the United States, Canada, and Asian countries, whereas PRRSV-E is prevalent in Europe.",

It follows that PRRSV diverged into two types varying by 40% of the amino acids within about 10 years and that PRRSV have evolved at a high evolutionary rate (order of 10\u22122/site/year) compared with those (orders of 10\u22123 to 10\u22125) of standard RNA viruses. However, the speculated evolutionary rate of PRRSV seemed too rapid compared with those of standard RNA viruses. Therefore, several researchers took the alternative view. The view is that the two types diverged well before the 1980s, evolved independently on American and European continents, and then emerged in swine on both continents at almost the same time (Nelsen, Murtaugh, and Faaberg 1999; Stadejek et al. 2002; Plagemann 2003). Thus, the divergence time and the evolutionary rate of PRRSV are unclear and deserving of molecular evolutionary analysis.",

            "text": "Furthermore, PRRSV provide an interesting opportunity to study the mechanisms of adaptation of PRRSV to swine because PRRSV may have adapted to swine over a short period of time. The important genes for viral adaptation to the host are usually considered to be those encoding the proteins located in the outside of the virion, where they interacted with the environment, including the host immune system. In PRRSV, there are nine open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a\u20131b, ORF2a\u20132b, ORF3\u20135, ORF6, and ORF7 encode replication proteins, unknown structure proteins, envelope proteins, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid proteins, respectively. Among these, ORFs 3, 4, 5, and 6 are known to be the genes encoding the outside components of the PRRSV virion. These ORFs are therefore considered to be important candidates for their adaptation to swine. Adaptive regions can be detected through inference of positively selected sites, which preferentially undergo amino acid replacements. Positively selected sites may provide important information not only for studying the adaptive evolution of PRRSV but also for developing vaccines.",

Despite the difference in genome sizes, the genome organizations of the order Nidovirales are remarkably similar to each other (De Vries et al. 1997). In the present study, in order to construct a phylogenetic tree of Nidovirales and to estimate the evolutionary position of PRRSV, we used the amino acid sequences of ORF1b because ORF1b was reported to be conserved among the order Nidovirales (Bredenbeek 1990; Snijder and Meulenberg 1998). The ORF1b sequences for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human corona virus (HcoV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV), Berne virus (BEV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase\u2013elevating virus (LDEV), simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), PRRSV-A, and PRRSV-E were collected from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database (INSD: DNA Data Bank of Japan/European Molecular Biology Laboratory/GenBank). The amino acid sequence accession numbers for TGEV, HcoV, MHV, BCV, AIBV, BEV, EAV, LDEV, SHFV, PRRSV-A, and PRRSV-E are AJ271965, AF304460, AF029248, AF391541, M95169, X52374, X53459, L13298, AF180391, AF046869, and M96262, respectively. The conserved regions in ORF1b were detected by the DotPlot program, DOTTER (Sonnhammer and Durbin 1995), and a multiple alignment of the conserved regions among the viruses was made by ClustalW (Thompson, Higgins, and Gibson 1994). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the maximum likelihood (Felsenstein 1981) and Neighbor-Joining methods (Saitou and Nei 1987) using MOLPHY version 2.3 and PHYLIP program package, respectively. The Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) model was used for constructing the maximum likelihood tree, whereas Kimura's equation was used to estimate the evolutionary distances for constructing the Neighbor-Joining tree. The robustness of the topology of each tree was examined by the bootstrap method.",

To estimate the most recent ancestral sequence for PRRSV-A and PRRSV-E, LDEV was used as the out-group in the phylogenetic tree because LDEV is the closest virus to PRRSV among the known viruses of Arteriviridae. The ancestral sequence was estimated by the nucleotide model of the likelihood approach (PAML version 3.13) (Yang, Kumar, and Nei 1995). The number of synonymous substitutions between the ancestral sequence and each PRRSV-A sequence was estimated by the Nei-Gojobori model (Nei and Gojobori 1986). The year of isolation and the synonymous distance were plotted for each viral sequence in the two-dimensional space, and both the synonymous substitution rate of PRRSV-A and the divergence time between PRRSV-A and PRRSV-E were estimated by the least squares method (Suzuki, Yamaguchi-Kabata, and Gojobori 2000). The standard error of the divergence time was estimated by the bootstrap method under the assumption that the topology of the phylogenetic tree was correct.

Positively selected amino acid sites were identified using the method of Suzuki and Gojobori (1999; Suzuki, Gojobori, and Nei 2001). In this method, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method using the number of synonymous substitutions. The ancestral sequence was inferred at each node of the phylogenetic tree using the maximum parsimony method (Hartigan 1973). Then, the average numbers of synonymous (sS) and nonsynonymous (sN) sites and the total numbers of synonymous (cS) and nonsynonymous (cN) substitutions throughout the phylogenetic tree were estimated for each codon site. The probability (P) of obtaining the observed or more biased numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions was computed for each codon site, assuming a binomial distribution. In the computation, sS/(sS + sN) and sN/(sS + sN) were used as the probabilities of the occurrence of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, respectively. The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (ds) and that of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dn) were estimated by cS/sS and cN/sN, respectively. The transmembrane and signal peptide regions of the envelope genes (ORFs 3, 4, 5, and 6) were estimated by TMPRED version 2.0 (Hofmann and Stoffel 1993).",

Assuming that the rate estimated for three ORFs can be extrapolated to the whole genome, the divergence times are 1986 \u00b1 1.8 and 1973 \u00b1 1.3 according to the distance-based and maximum likelihood methods, respectively. Epidemiologically, there are two hypotheses for the divergence time. One is that PRRSV diverged in approximately 1980, the other is that PRRSV diverged well before 1980s as far back as approximately 1900. Our results strongly supported the former hypothesis because the estimated divergence times were 1972\u20131988. However, our results could not identify with confidence that the two major types of PRRSV diverged at approximately the same time as PRRSV appeared in the United States, as the maximum likelihood divergence time indicates an earlier divergence time. We conclude that PRRSV diverged approximately within 10 years before PRRSV spread in the United States.",

We suggest two hypotheses for the extraordinarily rapid rate of PRRSV evolution, given the assumption that the rate of synonymous substitution is approximately equal to the mutation rate. The first is that the rate of replication error for PRRSV is extraordinarily high, and the second is that the number of replications per unit time (replication frequency) for PRRSV is extraordinarily high. To investigate support for these hypotheses, we compared the rate of replication error with the synonymous substitution rate among five RNA viruses, including PRRSV, as shown in table 2. In table 2, the replication error rate of PRRSV was estimated as follows. We first estimated the error rate per passage from the number of nucleotide substitutions occurring among passages (Yuan et al. 2001). Then, the replication error rate was estimated by the passage error rate divided by the time required for viral budding (Dea et al. 1995). The rates of replication error for other four RNA viruses were collected from literature (Holland et al. 1990; Schrag, Rota, and Bellini 1999; Stech et al. 1999; Escarmis et al. 2002). We also estimated the rates of synonymous substitution for these four RNA viruses (table 2). The results show that replication error rate is approximately equal between PRRSV and other RNA viruses. Even RNA viruses that have rates of synonymous substitution that are very different from PRRSV have replication error rates that are almost the same as that of PRRSV. It follows that the main source for the high synonymous substitution rate of PRRSV is the high replication frequency of PRRSV.",

PRRSV infect swine via the air, and swine continues to release the virus for half a year (Albina 1997). Viruses infected by air and inducing acute and persistent infection for long periods have been reported to have a rapid evolutionary rate (Hanada, Suzuki, and Gojobori 2004). PRRSV can also easily spread because of the dense population in swine facilities. Furthermore, as a reason why the speed of the spread could be accelerated, most swine do not have immunity against PRRSV because the virus only recently emerged in swine. Thus, it is considered that PRRSV not only repeated replications within each infected host but also quickly infected other individuals surrounding the infected host.",

Nevertheless, we detected sites in which dn exceeded ds. Among the sites where dn exceeded ds, we called a site where the value (1 \u2212 P) exceeded 0.95, a positively selected site (table 4). In figure 5, there are several sites where dn exceeded ds in the regions experimentally recognized as the B-cell epitopes of ORFs 3, 4, and 5 (Oleksiewicz et al. 2001; Ostrowski et al. 2002; Plagemann, Rowland, and Faaberg 2002), although (1 \u2212 P) did not exceed 0.95 at these sites. The ectodomain identified in ORF6 by TMPRED contained a positively selective site. This site may be susceptible to attack by the immune system. PRRSV may have escaped from the immune system of swine through replacements of such amino acid sites. These adaptive sites may also provide important information for developing vaccines for PRRSV because antibodies against the regions including adaptive sites could become ineffective after amino acid replacement at these sites. To develop an effective vaccine against PRRSV, it will be necessary to make a vaccine highly expressing the regions related to immunity but not those including adaptive sites (Suzuki 2004).",

Therefore, the positive selection of the membrane regions in ORF5 is considered to be important for adaptation of PRRSV to the membrane of swine cells. In fact, PRRSV emerged so suddenly in swine only about 20 years ago and may have not yet adapted completely to swine cells. Given these circumstances, we speculate that PRRSV transferred from another host to swine in about 1980 and adapted to swine cells by altering the transmembrane regions of ORF5.",
