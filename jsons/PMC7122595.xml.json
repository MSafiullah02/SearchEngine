The abdomen is shaved, moistened with a disinfectant, and opened by a cut parallel to the linea alba. The intestine is moistened with saline and placed in a plastic cover to prevent desiccation. The aorta is prepared free from connective tissue above the left renal artery and underlaid with a silk thread. Then, a cannula no. 1 (0.9 \u00d7 40 mm) is placed longitudinally to the aorta and both aorta and cannula are tied. The cannula is removed, leaving the aortic lumen determined by the diameter of the cannula. The intestine is placed back into the abdominal cavity with the application of 5.0 mg rolitetracycline (Reverin). In sham-operated controls, no banding is performed. The skin is closed by clipping.",

At the end of the experiment, blood pressure is measured under hexobarbital anesthesia (200 mg/kg i.p.) via indwelling catheters in the left carotid artery. Blood pressure measurement in conscious rats with the conventional tail-cuff method is not possible due to the large pressure difference across the ligature. Therefore, only one measurement at the end of the study is possible. The hearts are removed, rinsed in saline until free of blood, and gently blotted to dryness. Total cardiac mass is determined by weighing on an electronic balance to the nearest 0.1 mg. The atria and all adjacent tissues are trimmed off, and the weight of the left ventricle including the septum as well as the remaining cardiac tissue representing the right ventricle is determined separately. Weights are calculated per 100 g body weight.",

The left main coronary artery was ligated with Perma-Hand silk 4\u20130 USP (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany) near its origin at the aorta (2 mm distal to the edge of the left atrium). Ligation resulted in infarction of the free left ventricular wall. Ligation was deemed successful when the anterior wall of the left ventricle turned pale. At this point, the lungs were hyperinflated by increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure, and the chest was closed. The rats were placed on a heating pad. They were continuously monitored until they start moving in their cages. To avoid ventricular arrhythmias, lidocaine (2 mg/kg i.m.) was given before surgery. The sham procedure consisted of opening the pericardium and placing a superficial suture in the epicardium of the LV. To prevent acute lung edema, the rats received furosemide 2 mg/kg twice daily for 3 days via the drinking water.",

The fully anesthetized rats (phase III) were placed on a cradle made of Plexiglas in a supine position. Respiration and ECG were monitored continuously. MRI experiments were performed according to Rudin et al. (1991). The images were acquired by a spin-echo sequence SE (500/20), the field of view was 50 mm, and the image resolution was 256 \u00d7 256 pixels with a dimension of 0.2 \u00d7 0.2 mm. Four adjacent transverse slices were recorded; slice thickness was 1.5 mm. Before the acquisition of data, a coronary pilot scan was measured for adequate positioning of the transverse slices. MRI data acquisition was gated to the cardiac cycle by a Physiograd SM 785 MR monitoring system (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Two sets of transverse images were acquired, one at end-systole and another at end-diastole. End-diastole was defined as the image obtained 8 ms after the onset of the R wave of the ECG, corresponding to the largest cavity area. End-systole was defined as the image with the smallest LV cavity area. The image analysis was done using Bruker software (Karlsruhe, Germany). The parameters of left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), septum size, infarct size, ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular chamber diameter (r), and circumference were measured. EF was estimated in percentage terms by the subtraction of LVESV from LVEDV. After the procedure, the rats were ventilated with oxygen, the mask was replaced, and they were brought back into their cages. They were monitored until they started moving in the cage.",

A left thoracotomy was performed via the fourth intercostal space; the lungs were retracted to expose the heart, and the pericardium was opened. The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated with an 8\u20130 nylon suture near its origin between the pulmonary outflow tract and the edge of the left atrium. Acute myocardial ischemia was considered successful when the anterior wall of the left ventricle turned pale and an obvious ST segment elevation was observed. The lungs were inflated by increasing positive end-expiratory pressure and the thoracotomy site was closed. Sham-operated mice were subjected to the same procedure except that the suture around the left anterior coronary artery was not tied. Systolic blood pressure was measured in conscious mice using a noninvasive computerized tail-cuff system. Cardiac geometry and function were evaluated with a Doppler echocardiographic system.

The forth intercostal space is opened with two blunted forceps. The heart is pressed against the opening with the left hand. The pericardium is opened with a fine forceps and pulled back to the basis of the heart. The beating heart is extruded from the thorax wound by pressure with the left hand on the right thorax wall. A ring-shaped clamp covered with a thin rubber tube is placed around the basis of the heart, keeping the heart outside of the thorax without closing off the blood circulation. A thread soaked with diluted disinfectant solution is placed as a loop around the apex of the heart and tightened so that the apical third of both ventricles is tied off. The degree of tightening of the loop is essential. Complete interruption of blood supply to the apical third resulting in necrosis has to be avoided as well as the loop\u2019s slipping off. Technical skill is necessary to place the loop around the beating heart into the correct position. After removal of the clamp, the heart is placed back, the incision between the fourth and fifth costal rib closed, and the musculus pectoralis placed over the wound.

Histopathological changes consist of myocytolytic necrosis followed by fibrosis and calcification. The evolution of the cardiomyopathic disease can be characterized by five distinct phases: a prenecrotic stage, in which no pathology is evident, a time of active myocytolysis and cellular necrosis, a phase of fibrosis and calcium deposition, an overlapping period of reactive hypertrophy of the remaining viable myocytes, and a final stage of depressed myocardial performance and failure.",

Under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia and artificial respiration, the heart was exposed via a small left lateral thoracotomy and pericardiotomy, and a screw-in epicardial pacemaker lead was implanted into the right ventricle. The pacemaker was implanted subcutaneously into the left chest wall and connected to the pacemaker lead. The dogs were allowed to recover for at least 10 days after surgery before the pacemaker was started. During the first 10 days, dogs were paced at 180 beats/min (bpm), resulting in early left ventricular dysfunction as defined by significant systolic dysfunction with decreased cardiac output, cardiac enlargement, and increased filling pressures but maintained systemic perfusion pressure and renal sodium excretion and no clinical signs of heart failure. The pacing rate was then increased weekly to 200, 210, 220, and 240 bpm, and early left ventricular dysfunction evolved to overt congestive heart failure with avid sodium retention and clinical signs of congestion. At baseline (control), after dogs had been paced at 180 bpm for 10 days and at the end of the protocol (overt CHF), urine was collected for measurement of sodium excretion; conscious mean arterial pressure was measured via a port catheter; a 2-D-guided M-mode echogram was obtained; and arterial blood was drawn. Cardiac filling pressures and cardiac output were measured by the thermodilution method at baseline and at the end of the protocol. Arterial blood was collected in EDTA tubes for measurement of ANP, BNP, cGMP, PRA, aldosterone, and Ang II. After euthanasia, hearts were rapidly trimmed and left ventricles weighted for calculation of the index LV weight to body weight.",

Catheters connected to a vascular access port were placed in the thoracic aorta, the pulmonary artery, and the left atrium. The access ports were then placed in a subcutaneous pocket. A 20-mm flow probe was placed around the pulmonary artery immediately distal to the pulmonary catheter and the electrical connection exteriorized through the thoracolumbar fascia. A shielded stimulating electrode was sutured onto the left atrium, connected to a programmable pacemaker, and buried in a subcutaneous pocket. The thoracotomy was closed in layers and the pleural space evacuated of air. After a 14\u201321-day recovery, measurements were performed under normal resting conditions and after exercise. The pacemakers were activated to 240 bpm for a period of 21 days. During the last 3 days, one group was treated with drug, the other served as control. At the day of the study, electrocardiograms were performed, and the pacemakers deactivated. After a 30-min stabilization period, 2-D and M-mode echocardiographic studies were used to image the left ventricle from the parasternal approach. Left ventricular fractional shortening was calculated as (end-diastolic dimension \u2013 end-systolic dimension)/diastolic dimension and was expressed as a percentage. The access ports were entered and pressures obtained using externally calibrated transducers. The flow probe was connected to a digital flowmeter. From the digitized flow signal, stroke volume was computed on a beat-to-beat basis and averaged for a minimum of 25 ejections. Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances were computed as the mean pressure divided by cardiac output multiplied by the constant 80 to convert to resistance units of dyne \u00b7 s \u00b7 cm\u22125.

A catheter was placed into the femoral artery and advanced into the LV chamber for LV pressure recording. Animals then were placed on their left side in a Helmholtz coil with a diameter of 18 cm, which was used to improve signal to noise. To compute LV wall stress, the image acquisition was triggered by the LV pressure through the fluid-filled LV catheter. All of the imaging sequences were synchronized to the LV pressure trace. The electronic LV pressure signal was recorded and fed to a comparator set to a threshold level of 10 % of the upslope of the LV pressure curve at the beginning of systole. The signal from the comparator was sent to a pulse former and then fed to the ECG port of the magnetic resonance system, where it was treated like the standard electrographic input to run the pulse sequences. Scout images were taken in the axial plane with a single-shot, ultrafast gradient echo sequence (McDonald et al. 1992; Wilke et al. 1993; Geiger et al. 1995). From the axial image, both horizontal and vertical long-axis images were obtained. By alternating back and forth several times, a true vertical long axis of the left ventricle was obtained. From the long-axis scout image, short-axis segmented cine turboflash slices were prescribed to cover the myocardium from apex to base. The double oblique, short-axis turboflash images cover the heart from apex to base with a slice thickness of 10 mm, with no interslice gap.",

The program is based on robust deformable models of endocardial and epicardial border segmentation of ventricular boundaries in cardiac magnetic resonance images. This segmentation technique has been combined with a user interface that allows one to load, sort, visualize, and analyze a cardiac study in <20 min. The segmentation algorithm is based on the steepest descent as well as dynamic programming strategies integrated via multiscale analysis for minimizing the energy function of the resulting contour. The ventricular boundaries are used to construct a three-dimensional model for visualization and to compute hemodynamic parameters. Automatic segmentation of endocardial and epicardial boundaries was performed for calculation of ventricular volumes, EF, LV diastolic and systolic volumes, and absolute myocardial mass from multislice, multiphase magnetic resonance cine images. Starting with a user-specified approximate boundary or an interior point of the ventricle for one starting image in one slice, the algorithm generated automatic contours corresponding to the epicardium and the endocardium and automatically propagated them to other slices in the cardiac phase (spatial propagation) and to other phases for a given slice location (temporal propagation) of the cardiac study. The observer then could make some manual corrections to the six or seven pairs of contours in the first column of the temporal-spatial matrix. Manual modifications generally were made on the apex and base levels.",

The coil was cemented to a sheet of silicone rubber 0.7 mm in thickness and \u224850 % larger in diameter than the coil itself. A capillary containing 15 \u03bcl of 3 M phosphonoacetic acid was placed at the coil center to serve as a reference. The proton signal from water detected with the surface coil was used to homogenize the magnetic field and to adjust the position of the animal in the magnet so that the coil was at or near the magnet and gradient isocenters. This was accomplished with a spin-echo experiment and a readout gradient. The information gathered in this step also was used to determine the spatial coordinates for spectroscopic localization. Chemical shifts were measured relative to CP, which was assigned a chemical shift of \u22122.55 ppm relative to 85 % phosphoric acid at 0 ppm.",

Signal origin was restricted with the use of B0 gradients and adiabatic inversion pulses to a column coaxial with the surface coil perpendicular to the LV wall. The column dimensions were 17 \u00d7 17 mm. Within this column, the signal was further localized using the B1 gradient to five voxels centered about 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, and 135\u00b0 spin rotation increments. FSW localization used a nine-term Fourier series expansion. The Fourier coefficients, the number of free induction decays acquired for each term in the Fourier expansion, and the multiplication factors used to construct the voxels have been reported previously. The position of the voxels relative to the coil was set using the B1 magnitude at the coil center, which was experimentally determined in each case by measurement of the 90\u00b0 pulse length for the phosphonoacetic acid reference located in the coil center. Each set of spatially localized transmural spectra was acquired in 10 min. A total of 96 scans was accumulated within each 10-min block.",
