The factors identified were the need for oxygen supplementation and a low lymphocyte count during the course of illness.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Inflammatory damage to the small airways is the most common injury sustained by the human lung. 19 Viral infection causing significant pulmonary sequelae, especially small airway disease, is often reported after adeno-virus and mycoplasma infection. 20 HRCT has become the investigation of choice for the detection and evaluation of air-space and airway diseases, especially those associated with small airway damage. 21 The abnormal findings on HRCT in the present study included residual ground-glass opacification and air trapping. Ground-glass opacification is a predominant feature seen during the acute stage of SARS. It is a nonspecific radiological appearance commonly found in children suffering from infective pneumonia of any etiology, and in most cases, it is reversible and does not lead to significant lung function deficit. 22 Air trapping is secondary to collateral air drift into the alveoli beyond the narrowed or obstructed bronchus or bronchiole. 23 It causes decreases in pulmonary blood flow, and leads to gradual atrophy of the involved portion of the lung tissue. 24 Air trapping on HRCT was found in 15% and 37% of children with a history of Adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumonia, respectively. 24, 25 Residual lung function abnormalities were also reported in association with air trapping demonstrated on HRCT. Mok et al. 26 found longterm impairment of small airway function, and Sabato et al. 27 showed persistent spirometric abnormalities, even in asymptomatic children, at 3 years following Mycoplasma pneumonia. Our cohort of children whose HRCT revealed air trapping remained clinically asymptomatic with normal lung function. In fact, we were unable to demonstrate any significant lung function differences between subjects with isolated HRCT changes, a combination of changes, and those with normal HRCT findings. This discrepancy may be explained by the mild abnormalities found on their HRCT, even though we did not attempt to grade the severity of involvement within affected lung segments. Chang et al., 13 in a follow-up study, found a proportion of children with postinfectious small airway damage to have normal lung function. Poor correlation was also demonstrated between the extent of HRCT abnormalities and lung function test results. 28 Lymphopenia was found to be a significant risk factor for abnormal HRCT in our study. It is possible that patients with the lowest lymphocyte count manifested a more intense immunopathological response, with a tendency toward pulmonary sequelae. Children with more severe bronchiolitis from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection were shown to have significantly lower absolute lymphocyte counts than those with mild disease. 29 In adults affected with SARS, T-cell lymphopenia was found to predict adverse outcomes. 30 The actual mechanism for lymphopenia is still unknown. It is possible that in severe SARS, a combination of heightened immune responseenhancing lymphocyte apoptosis and direct viral invasion and destruction of lymphocytes cumulatively cause the end result of lymphopenia. 30, 31 The other significant predictor for abnormal HRCT findings is the requirement of oxygen supplementation. This is likely to be another marker of more severe disease, rather than a causative factor in lung damage. There are certain limitations to our study. First, there was no control group or subjects admitted with lower respiratory tract infection other than SARS during the same time period for comparison. Although data from a comparison group would provide further confirmation of the abnormalities detected in our SARS cohort, we considered it unreasonable to subject normal children or those who recovered from typical common pneumonia to unnecessary radiation. Our HRCT study protocol involved a low-dose technique which aimed to minimize radiation exposure for participants. Second, our study was a crosssectional assessment of lung function and radiological features. To better understand the progress and natural history of the abnormalities identified in this cohort, it would be ideal and essential to undertake a longitudinal study to assess the changes in the various parameters over time. We plan to carry out such a longitudinal follow-up study. Third, we were only able to recruit 47 subjects for this study from the initial cohort of 80 children. However, on reviewing hospital admission records and discharge summaries, the demographic characteristics of the attendants and nonattendents were similar, and all those who refused assessment were clinically milder cases.
