We audited outcomes in these patients to determine prognostic factors that may aid patient selection and management. METHODS. 263 consecutive admissions (170 males, 93 females, age > 16years) from February 1, 2006 to February 28, 2007 were prospectively studied. The total SOFA score on Day1 (SOFA1), the highest SOFA score of the first three days (MAX3) and the change in SOFA score between Day2 and Day1 (Delta1) and between Day3 and Day1 (Delta2) were calculated. Predictors of outcome were identified using univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression. RESULTS. 58 patients had solid tumours , 89 had leukemia, 84 lymphoma, 17 myeloma, and 15 had other diagnoses. Mean age was 44.8\u00b116 years and APACHE II score was 21.2\u00b17.9. ICU mortality was 71% and hospital mortality 78.7%. 67/74 patients (90.5%) with ICU stay < 1 day died. Overall length of ICU stay was 3.7\u00b14.3days. In survivors vs. nonsurvivors, SOFA1, Delta1 and Delta2 (median, interquartile range) were 3.0(1.0 to 6.0) vs. 8.0(5.0 to 12.0; p<0.000), -1.0(-2.0 to 0) vs. 1.0(-1.0 to 3.0; p<0.000) and 0(-2.75 to 1.0) vs. 1.0(-1.0 to 5.0; p<0.02), respectively. Several factors were associated with mortality on univariate analysis (Table 1) . On multivariate analysis, only need for vasopressors (OR 9.14, p=0 .002) and MAX3 (OR 1.52, CI 1.19-1.93, p=0.001) were independently associated with hospital mortality, while type of cancer and leucopenia were not. For 141 patients staying >2 days, no factor predicted hospital mortality, but SOFA1 (OR 1.64, CI 1.01-2.68, p=0.047), Delta1 (OR 1.57, CI 1.15-2.14, p=0.004) and Delta2 (OR 1.25, CI 1.01-1.60, p=0.04) predicted ICU mortality.

ICU outcome is independently associated with the number of RBC transfused, but not with their age. This result in contradiction with previous report could possibly be explained by the systematic leucodepletion performed before storage in France, contrary to precedent studies where RBC were not leukodepleted. We compared them with \u226570 years old and an ICU stay < 30 days patients, the differences in ICU mortality, Apache II, age, gender and the necessity for renal replacement therapy (RRT) were not significant (see table) . The survivors patients (\u226570 years old and an ICU stay \u2265 30 days) were more older and 21(65'62%) were still alive one year later.

The average ICU length of stay in patients with SAP was 17 days compared to 5 days in patients with mild form of the disease. Pancreatic infection was present in 8 patients. The mortality rate in the group with SAP was 31% compared to 2,8% in the group with mild acute pancreatitis, p< 0,05. The most common etiology of patients with SAP was biliary and this was similar both in survivors and non-survivors. The most common cause of death in the group with SAP was multiple organ dysfunction/failure syndrom(MODS/MOF) in 80% followed by bleeding complications in 20%. Twelve patients with SAP (34%) underwent the surgical intervention. Mortality in the group of patients who underwent a surgical intervention was 25% (3 patients). 55,0+/-17,5 56,3+-14,08 APACHE II score( mean+/-SD) 20,2+/-11,3 10,0+-6,9* Necrotising form (%) 90 88 Infected necrosis (%) 20 24 CT guided FNAB (%) 30 32 * p > 0.05 CONCLUSION. The patients with mild form of acute pancreatitis had low mortality rate (similar to general ward population) despite positive ICU admission criteria in our case series with fifty per cent development of severe form with organ dysfunction/failure later on. APACHE II score was better predictor of mortality in patients with SAP than presence, extent or infection of pancreatic necrosis. Patients with higher risk for development of severe form of acute pancreatitis should be admitted to multidisciplinary ICU prior to definitive diagnostic evaluation of pancreas. Further studies are warranted. CONCLUSION. ABSI is an aprropiate score for estimating the probability of death in critical brun injury patients. Preexisting cardiac and liver diseases have a little influence on mortality and its addition to the ABSI variables don't predict mortality more accurately.",

Two isoforms of 11HSD are known.

Early microcirculatory impairment followed by mitochondrial dysfunction may combine to produce multi-organ failure in sepsis. We recently reported that tissue oxygen tension (tPO2), the balance of local O2 supply/demand, is variably affected in four different organs (kidney cortex, liver, muscle, bladder) at 3h' post-endotoxin challenge (1). We seek to measure temporal changes in tPO2 in these organs in a resuscitated rat model for up to 72h following the onset of faecal peritonitis. Here we present our 6-hr timepoint results with assessment of the impact of fluid loading. METHODS. Male Wistar rats (approx 300g weight) with tunnelled right jugular venous cannulae in situ received i.p. injection of faecal slurry. Fluid (1:1 mixture of 5% glucose/6% hetastarch; 10 ml/kg/h) was started 2h later. At 6h, rats were anaesthetised with isoflurane, and then instrumented with a left common carotid arterial line and tissue PO2 probes (Oxford Optronix, UK) sited in thigh muscle, between right and left liver lobes, in the left renal cortex and within the bladder lumen. After 30-min stabilisation, recordings were made of BP, tPO2, and end-diastolic volume (EDV) and cardiac output (CO) by echocardiography (Vivid 7, GE Healthcare, Bedford, UK). This was performed before (BI, baseline instrumented) and after fluid challenge (F) of 25 ml/kg bolus of 6% hetastarch given to optimise LV filling. Comparisons were made against sham-operated animals that underwent instrumentation but received no i.p. injection. ",

Despite the 30% reduction in output, baseline tPO2 values were similar in bladder and renal cortex compared to sham animals but showed a decreased trend in muscle and a significant reduction in liver. Fluid loading restored cardiac output to control values, however only muscle and liver tPO2 increased, albeit not significantly. These data suggest a combination of microcirculatory and mitochondrial dysfunction with each predominating in different organ beds at this timepoint. Confirmation is required using complementary techniques. ",

The higher baseline [Ca 2+ ]i in the vascular smooth muscle of septic arteries suggests an abnormality of intracellular calcium storage. The ability of VP to produce a greater contractile response in septic compared to sham arteries, despite an equivalent degree of [Ca 2+ ]i elevation, implies sensitisation of the contractile apparatus to the effect of VP.

The aim of this study was to measure the effects of acutely administered rhEPO on IL-1B and MIP-2 after TBI. METHODS. With Home Office approval, under isoflurane anesthesia 9 rats SD were subject to lateral fluid percussion TBI (1.6-1.8 atm) (Dixon J Neurosurg 1987) of the left parietal cortex. EPO (1000, 3000 or 5000 iu/kg) or placebo were injected in a random and double blinded manner by the intra-peritoneal (ip)route. The ipsi-and contra-lateral cerebral cortices were removed 4h later and homogenized. IL-1B and MIP-2 were measured in the surnageant using ELISA kits.

Twenty nine patients were submitted to craniotomy and 37 p were submitted to unilateral or bilateral decompressive craniectomy. Mean LOS was 37.8 d for p submitted to a surgical intervention versus 39 d for the other group. Barbiturates were used in 16 p (9%). A total of 138 patients survived (78.4%). Death was due to neurological cause (herniation of brain stem and subsequent cerebral death) in 25 p. Other causes of death included sepsis, multi organ failure, severe injury in other organs, and hemorrhage from upper gastrointestinal tract. A poor neurologic outcome (mean Glasgow outcome score < 7) was noticed in 10% of patients.",

There is a tendency to decrease in Hto and Hb parameters, but not significant. The only parameter we observe difference statistically significative was the Reticulocites rate (%retic), significative lower 7 days after admission. (p<0.05) In Graphic 1 we describe anaemia groups in admission and the evolution of anaemia groups seven days after admission. We appreciated that no anaemia group suffers a severe decrease. 30% of patients were transfused during their fist week stay. Average levels of pre-transfusional Hb were 8.01 g/dl . We analysed transfusion predictors. Hto and Hb levels at admission predict transfusion. There is no other analytical parameter at admission that predicts transfusion. We also detected Tracheal intubated patients at admission and patients with inotropic drugs perfusions at admission were significative more transfused (p<0.02 and p<0.05). CONCLUSION. The high mortality rate in our patients is related to the initial GCS and cranial CAT at the moment of admission. It is necessary to continue the study to determine the influence of the rest of the variables in the mortality rate of these patients. INTRODUCTION. Traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Early diagnosis of sepsis versus SIRS is frequently difficult in neurointensive critical care units. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been used as a predictor marker of bacterial infection in different groups of patients. There is variable and scarce information about PCT in neurocritical patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of serum PCT in the early diagnosis of fever from bacterial infectious origin in patients with acute brain hemorrhage.",

After this period the patients received Amantix in tablets. Many additional therapeutic measures from different groups were used in those patients. An endotracheal intubation and ventilation were necessary in all of the patients. Amantix was used as treatment's supplementation in the dose of 2x200mg/day. At the admission the patients were classified with the use of GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale). In order to evaluate the effects of use of the preparation, some specific function of the patients were examined before the use of Amantix and after finishing of the therapy.

The data shows an upwards trend for the years prior to and during the establishment of the Outreach service, and a falling trend subsequently. CONCLUSION. The establishment of a comprehensive Outreach service that promotes all aspects of Outreach Critical Care (expediting appropriate and preventing inappropriate critical care admissions, following up patients post critical care discharge and promoting critical care skills throughout the hospital) is likely to lead to a reduced frequency of cardiac arrest calls. However, this effect may take years and not months following introduction to be manifest.

He died during prolonged hospitalization. Case 2. A 51-year old woman with obstructive sleep apnoea reduced her diuretic prescription without her physician's knowledge prior to a long-haul flight. She deteriorated with acute shortness of breath shortly after her arrival at the family home in the UK. She was brought by her family to the Emergency Department where she was found to be in cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, requiring non-invasive ventilation. She survived hospitalization and was discharged with home oxygen therapy. Case 3. A 39-year old man collapsed in the street explaining to passers-by that he had swallowed some packages. He had a travel ticket from the airport in his possession but was able to give no other history. He was taken to the Emergency Department and required intubation due to extreme agitation. He was found radiographically to have ingested multiple wrapped packets. He required laparotomy to remove 36 differently coloured packs some of which had ruptured releasing their contents. Urinalysis revealed cocaine metabolites. He subsequently made an uneventful recovery after extubation and transfer to a surgical ward.",

INTRODUCTION. Strict glycemic control by lowering blood glucose levels to 80 -110 mg/dL reduces the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, morbidity, duration of the hospital stay, and overall medical care costs. To provide an intelligent system for tight glycemic control, the EU-project \"Closed Loop Insulin Infusion for Critically Ill Patients (CLINICIP)\" was started in January 2004. Three different sensor technologies -two based on an enzymatic reaction with immobilised glucose oxidase using either amperometry or fluorimetry as transducer and another based on reagent-free infrared spectroscopy -have been developed to continuously monitor the glucose levels in the subcutaneous interstitial body fluid.",

The laboratory reference method is hexokinase for measuring the plasma glucose levels. Some drugs and metabolites can interfere with POC methods.

The Accu-chek Inform overestimates moderately the glucose level while the Precision PCX and the Rapidlab underestimate it slightly. The Wilcoxon ranked test with Bonferroni correction gave a p < 0.001 for comparing the bias from the Accu-chek to the bias from the Precision PCx, p < 0.001 when compared to the bias obtained for the RapidLab. No statistical difference between the Precision PCx bias and Rapilab was found. The R 2 of Spearmann correlating the effect of the uric acid level and the difference between the Accu-chek and the reference method was 0.247. The weak effect of the uric acid level of the patient on the overestimation of the glucose measured by the Accu-chek can be summarized as : Glucose difference(Accu-chek-Laboratory) = 2.53 x Uric Acid (mg/dL) -2.3 .

However, SAPS II at ICU admission (40\u00b110 vs 48\u00b114, p = 0.015) was significantly lower in cases than in controls. Duration of adequate antibiotic treatment for first VAP episode was significantly shorter in cases than in controls (12 \u00b1 3 vs 14 \u00b1 4d, p = 0.031). Inadequate initial antibiotic treatment was the only variable independently associated with relapse of VAP related to NF-GNB (OR [95% CI] = 8.1 ",

A significant increase in pro-inflammatory factors after surgery can be observed. We examined the NTL of 9 infants who underwent heart surgery and who did not develop pneumonia. We noticed that the number of neutrophils increased significantly in all patients after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, sometimes reaching 80%. We consider it as a sign of pulmonary inflammatory process. The number of nonviable alveolar macrophages before and after surgery exceeded 50%. It indicates a decrease in cellular pulmonary protection. The PMN-elastase peripheral blood activity was 273.2\u00b175.00 IU/ml preoperatively and 339\u00b1 55.00 IU/ml postoperatively; the \u03b11-PI level was 32.1\u00b17.0 IU/ml and 32.5\u00b115.00 IU/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION. Thus, an increase in the peripheral blood level of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in infants who underwent heart surgery.

The concentration of TNF-alpha was significantly higher in the group of patients with positive BAL (table 1) . It has been demonstrated in a swine model that therapeutic hypothermia (30\u02daC) facilitated transthoracic defibrillation. However, the mechanisms leading to reduced defibrillation threshold (DFT) remain unclear. We hypothesized that therapeutic hypothermia promotes the wavefront organization of ventricular fibrillation (VF), therefore facilitating defibrillation. METHODS. By using a two-camera optical mapping system, epicardial activation patterns of VF were studied in 7 isolated rabbit hearts at baseline (37\u02daC), 10-min therapeutic hypothermia (30\u02daC), and 10-min rewarming (37\u02daC). In 12 additional hearts, DFT50 (voltage required to achieve 50% probability of successful defibrillation, n=6 hearts) and APD (action potential duration)/conduction velocity (CV) restitutions (n=6 hearts) were determined at these 3 stages. RESULTS. Comparing with at baseline (35\u00b15%) and rewarming (34\u00b17%), there was a higher percentage of VF duration containing organized repetitive activities during hypothermia (73\u00b110%, p<0.001). However, there was no significant difference of DFT50 among these 3 stages (151\u00b134, 141\u00b138, and 146\u00b146 V, p=0.556). The electrophysiologic characteristics of ventricles at these 3 stages were summarized in table 1. In brief, hypothermia prolonged APD, decreased CV, and subsequently shortened wavelength. Hypothermia also failed to flatten the slope of APD restitution. Furthermore, APD dispersion at the epicardial surfaces of both ventricles and CV heterogeneity among 4 epicardial lines were all enhanced by hypothermia. (pt) with Acute Coroanry Syndrome (ACS) at admission is a associated with a high mortality. The mechansims are poorly understood.

Massmedia is usually sole information channel (53%), ticked in all cases. Other sources were: family, school and peers. Regarding attitude to donation: we found no differences in refusals between own donation or relatives'(25%); or in doubts 46% -42%. Related to transparency and parity of the health system: 26% believed equality did not exist and 60% had doubts. 55% felt this inequality was worse abroad. 64% are convinced that organ trafficking exists and 26% assume it is possible. Pre-course standpoint by course is showed in figure 1 . 9% had prior knowledge about Spanish Transplant law. Following classes the students claim higher awareness (87%). In general they maintain their standpoint on donation,45% have reconsidered their previous attitude. Regarding transparency and equality, 26% maintain doubts and 15 % are convinced of its absence. On trafficking: 72% assume it is possible, 13% occurs exclusively abroad, uniform group distribution. Post-course attitudes by course are in figure 1 . Despite an in-depth discussion about the law and its consequences (presumed consent), they generally disagree and some consider this too extreme , refusing to accept that donation is an obligation (only 8% agree) and believing that it should be an optional act of solidarity (81%). CONCLUSION. Knowledge about donation and transplant in urban areas is slanted, due to information sources ( usually mass media ) and a warped (TV-dominated) perception of the health system's transparency and equality. A considerable number of students still refuse donation or maintain their scepticism, despite a decrease following classes. However, our desire is not to convince them to become donors, we simply wish to provide decision-making tools. Generally college students ,without gender differences, are the most resistant to the process, having the greatest incidence of refusals and doubts about transparency, equality and organ trafficking. 140 (115-186) 0.18c (PaO2/FiO2) / PEEP day 1 12.5 (7.9-25.19) 10.7 (6.2-20.7) 0.33c (PaO2/FiO2) / PEEP day 3 14.8 (9.6-20.3) 11.2 (8.4-14.7) 0.01c (PaO2/FiO2) / PEEP day 7 13.3 (10.8-27.5) 10.6 (7.8-17.9) 0.02c CONCLUSION.

Restoration of intravascular volume by massive fluid administration without pulmonary edema formation is one of the biggest challenges in the early treatment of burn shock. Although it is not easy to predict the development of the respiratory failure before the treatment, the hallmark of the edema is increased capillary permeability which may be possible to measure by the pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI). The aim of the present study was to clarify whether the PVPI is predictable indicator of pulmonary edema formation in patients with burn.",

We measured the extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) and the pulmonary vascular permeability index(PVPI) as soon as the PiCCO catheter was inserted. Infusion volume was calculated according to the Parkland formula. Only crystalloid fluid (lactated Ringer's) was infused during the first 12 hours after the thermal injury. We investigated the medical records and defined the respiratory failure during the period of burn shock as a clinical syndrome of acute respiratory distress associate with pulmonary rales and radiographic evidence. Inclusion criteria were: 1)acute onset and rapid progress, 2)oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2 ratio<200 and 3) bilateral infiltrates on Chest X-ray.

In addition TEA attenuated the increase in epithelial permeability to dextran 5 hours after administration of high dose endotoxin (TEA: 460 [313/497]ng/ml vs. control: 656 [579/1105]ng/ml).CONCLUSION.In the investigated models of normotensive endotoxaemia TEA prevented the endotoxin-induced decrease in intestinal perfusion and attenuated the increase in epithelial permeability. Therefore TEA may have a protective effect on gut barrier function by increasing intestinal perfusion during endotoxaemia.REFERENCE(S). AdolphsJ et al.

From the first communication in 1976, lots of possible risk factors for the development of CIPNM have been suggested, including severity scores, altered laboratory tests and treatment measures. Sepsis and organ failure are probably the stronger risk factors; sedation and mechanical ventilation (MV), associating immobility and muscular disuse, could favour the development of CIPNM.

Ferrer*, E. Piacentini, J. Nava Intensive care, Hospital Mutua de Terrassa, Terrassa, Spain INTRODUCTION. Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measurements and abdominal perfusion pressure(APP)calculation have been identified as essential to the diagnosis of intra-abdominal hypertension. Recent guidelines state IAP should be measured at end-expiration in the supine position (1). However, mechanically ventilated (MV) patients should be in semirecumbent position to avoid ventilator-associated pneumonia. We hypothesized that IAP measurement in supine position in these patients will underestimate the \"real\" IAP. Water balance in ICU patients can vary widely and this can alter both MAP and IAP, but the \"net\" influence on APP is unknown. Objectives: 1. To evaluate if changes in the degree of bed-bolster inclination alter IAP and APP measurements. 2. To evaluate the influence of free water balance on measurements of IAP and APP. METHODS. MV, hemodynamically stable patients were included. IAP and MAP were measured with the bolster at 0 o , 30 o and 45 o . Two measurements per patient were taken, each one separated by 12 hours. Balance corresponding to these 12 hours was measured.CONCLUSION. IAP and APP change significantly with body position. In some patients APP was below normal value with body position at 30 o and 45 o . Patients with balance(+), despite increased IAP, have higher APP in the second measurement. Patients with balance(-)have no changes between the two measurements. The underestimation of IAP in supine position in MVpatients suggests that measurement of IAP should be done in the conventional semirecumbent position in these patients. REFERENCE(S). 1.

Guimaraens 2 1 Intensive Care Unit, 2 Diagnostic and therapeutic neuroangiography department, Hospital General de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain INTRODUCTION. Cerebral vasoespasm is the most important cause of late cerebral ischemia in patients with subarachnoidal haemorrhage(SAH), and one of the most important cause of dead and functional impairment. Intraarterial nimodipine is an alternative therapy which can offer good results, both clinically and radiologically. The aim of this study was to determine functional and radiological (cerebral ischaemia) prognosis after treatment with intraarterial nimodipine in patients diagnosed of SAH who present symptomatic cerebral vasoespasm.METHODS.Prospective study performed in a 30 bed polivalent Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Between January 2005 and December 2006 were analized 168 patients with SAH. Vasoespasm was diagnosed by Transcranial Doppler in 45 patients (27%). Vasoespasm was symptomatic (neurological deficit) without cerebral ischaemia (controlled by CT scanner) in 20 patients (4 males, 16 females, medium age 52 years old). All of them were treated with intraarterial nimodipine under angiographic control.RESULTS.Mortality in ICU 10% (n=2, one of them of respiratory cause). Neurological improvement after intraarterial nimodipine in 90% of patients. At discharge from the ICU 11 patients (61%) presented ad integrum neurological recovering, CT scan was normal (no cerebral ischaemia) in 11 patients , 17 patients with Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 5 in 11 patients, GOS 4 in 3 patients and GOS 3 in 4 patients. There were no complications related to the procedure.CONCLUSION.Intraarterial nimodipine as a treatment of symptomatic vasoespasm is a safe technique with good clinical results when used early and before cerebral ischaemia appears.INTERMEDIATE CARE: POLYSOMNOGRAPHIC SCREENING FOR SLEEP RE-LATED BREATHING IN POSTACUTE STROKE PATIENTS, PATTERNS OF SLEEP ARCHITECTURE CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN EARLY NEURORE-HABILITATION C. Haider*, E. Steingassner, H. Zauner, P. Loecker, A. Gassner Neurorehabilitation, Rehabilitation Center Gro\u00dfgmain, Gro\u00dfgmain, Austria INTRODUCTION. More than 60% of stroke and TIA sufferers experience sleep disordered breathing. Recent publications focus on the role of sleep in brain plasticity respectively in learning and memory. Two contradictuos hypotheses receive experimental support: 1.)REM sleep serves an important role, 2.) REM sleep serves no role in memory processing and consolidating. METHODS. Subjects: 22 consecutive inpatients, Barthelindex (BI) 30 divided the patients into 2 groups. 13 Patients had a BI <30. Gender: 13 men, median age 64 years (26-79). Time since onset of symptoms and signs to start of neurorehabilitation (NR) 7 weeks (2-14). Measurements: Outcome: Barthel Index, early rehabilitation version (BI), Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL), Extended Activities of Daily Living (EADL), Rivermead Motor Assessment (RMA), Tinetti Test (TT) a test for motor skills. Polysomnographic findings: Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI), Percentage of REM Sleep (REM%) Statistics: spearman's rank, multiple regression analysis. Descriptive data of cohort: median/mean -as appropriate. RESULTS. 20 out of 22 patients showed sleep disordered breathing in this early rehabilitation phase, definition >10/h, 11 patients showed severe sleep apnea with AHI> 30/h. Prevalence of central sleep apnea could be documented in 13/22 patients. Correlation analysis between sleep parameters (AHI, REM sleep, central apneas) and motor outcome parameters (TT, RMA, BADL) for the whole sample: p< 0,05; n.s. For the whole sample (with and without sleep apnea) the amount of REM-sleep is not associated with motor learning measured by TT, RMA, BADL, EADL. There was a positive correlation in 1 tailed testing between %REM sleep and TT, p=0,018.CONCLUSION. 1.) Routine screening for sleep disordered breathing in the early postacute phase after stroke seems to be indicated in light of our findings with a high prevalence of 91%. 2.) Specifying our hypothesis we could show a positive correlation between amount of REM sleep and improvement in Tinetti test. Thus sleep architecture could serve as a predictor for capacity for motor learning processes.REFERENCE(S). Basetti et al. Sleep apnea in acute cerebrovascular diseases. Sleep 1999. Dyken et al.

John* 1 , A. S. Arunkumar 1 , S. S. Prabhu 1 , S. Joseph 2 , M. Vakamudi 1 1 CRITICAL CARE, 2 Neurointerventional Radiology, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, India INTRODUCTION. Prediction of outcome for patients with SAH using general scoring systems is often unreliable. Our objective was to determine the factors affecting the outcome in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm coiling and to evaluate the different scoring systems as predictors of mortality and morbidity.METHODS.Design : Prospective observational study in a consecutive cohort of 64 adults who underwent endovascular aneurysm coiling between 2004 to 2006 in a tertiary care center. Measurements: The various physiological variables were measured in the first 24 hours of admission. The major outcomes (in-hospital mortality and modified Rankin scale scores)& minor outcomes (ICU days, ventilator days, hospital stay, ventilator free days )were measured. Statistics: Done using SPSS version 15. Fisher's test for categorical and student t test for continuous variables.RESULTS.Mortality was 14/64 (21.87%). Age, sex, comorbid conditions, presenting symptoms, duration, focal neurological deficits, site, size,location and multiplicity of aneurysms did not corrleate with any of the outcomes. Presence of hydrocephalus influenced mortality (p = 0.03). SAH PDS most strongly correlated with major and minor outcomes and mortality prediction on ROC had an area under the curve of 0.961. Scoring systems did not significantly correlate with the hospital stay and ventilator free days.",

University of Oviedo, Oviedo, SpainINTRODUCTION.Survival and recovery of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage(SIH) has improved in the last years. The aim of our study was to determine long term survival and associated predictors obtained on admission which may influence survival and functional outcome.METHODS.In a prospective cohort study we enrolled 66 adults with SIH admitted in the ICU for 24 hours or longer. Traumatic and subaranochoid haemorrhage, hemorrhagic transformation of an infart and patients with preceding use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents were excluded. Sex, age,high blood pressure,ApacheII,Glasgow(GCS),leucocytes, location,volume(method ABC/2)were recorded on admission. Survival of patients at the end of study was investigated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves after 1-year were calculated and compared by Log-Rank test. Factors associated with survival were obtained using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Functional outcome at discharged from ICU and one year after were evaluated by the GOS and Modified Rankin Scale(MRS).RESULTS. 66 patients were identified. The mean age was 58\u00b113(35-79)years. 54% were hypertense patients. Mean value of ApacheII was 16 and GCS was 7.4 on admission. Average hematoma volume on head CT was 48(8-140) mL. This volume exceeded 60 mL in 30% of all patients. Mean length of stay at ICU was 15\u00b115(2-78)days and total hospital stay was 52\u00b155(2-189)days. Survivors had a significantly higher ICU stay when compared with non-survivors(22\u00b114 versus 7\u00b19 days;p< 0.0001). Total hospital stay was higher in survivors(76\u00b159 versus 14\u00b129 days; p<0.0001). Mean survival (1-year cohort analysis)was cant independent predictors of survival within the first year. At the time of ICU discharge,78% had poor functional condition and were dependent as evaluated by the GOS and 76% by the mRS.24% of the patients who survived after one year evaluated by the GOS were dependent and 32% evaluated with MRS. Global improvement was estimated at 50%. CONCLUSION. 1)SIH has an early mortality. Most of patients died during the first week. Patients who survive this phase have a high probability of continuing alive at the 30-day and one year later. 2)On admission at ICU, an initial high GCS in combination with a reduced haematoma volume are the most important predictors associated to the long term survival.3)Most survivors of SIH do improve functionally over the subsequent months.",

On that day S. maltophilia grew from four sinks/taps. Subsequent testing of the water supply two weeks later yielded S. maltophilia. Full genomic analysis of the patient and environmental isolates was performed.CONCLUSION. S. maltophilia infection was previously rare in our ICU. This cluster of cases prompted us to search for predisposing risk factors, to examine patient characteristics, and also environmental sources of infection. The growth of S. maltophilia from taps and the ICU water supply prompted emergency hydrogen peroxide (Sanosil Super 25) disinfection of the system, and interim use of 0.2 \u00b5m inline filters on taps. A continuous water chlorination system for the ICU is planned. We now ensure patients receive only carbonated bottled drinking water. We restrict our use of carbapenems and plan three monthly water source bacteriological sampling. Molecular typing has confirmed that this outbreak was caused by cross contamination from our water source.VALIDATION OF THE MEASURE OF THE PROCALCITONIN TO THE SIDE OF STREAM BED AS MARKING OF INFECTION IN PATIENTS OF INTENSIVETHERAPY M.

Lima 1 1 Intensive Care Unit, 2 Richet Laboratory, Samaritano Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilINTRODUCTION.Elevation in the serum concentration of procalcitonin (PCT) has been proposed as a marker of disease severity and is associated with systemic infection. This association has led to the proposed use of PCT as a novel biomarker of bacterial sepsis. We sought to evaluate the PCT measurement with cultures samples to quickly ratify the sepsis and rapidly begin the use of antibiotic.METHODS.During September 2006 and march 2007,we evaluate 82 blood samples from 82 patients -48 male (80.33 +/-10.55 years) and 34 female (81.17 +/-13.83 years) with Bone criterions of SIRS or sepsis in the adult ICU of a terciary hospital. PCT levels were performed by a quantitative imunoturbidimetry method -ng/ml (Brahms, Lumitest PCT, Germany) and compared results with sample culture (blood, urine, traqueal secretion and others).RESULTS.With the cutoff of PCT levels at 2 ng/ml and sample cultures positive or negative the analysis found that sensitivity is 37%, specificity is 92%, positive predictive value (PPV) is 0.84, negative predictive value (NPV) is 0.40, positive Likelihood Ratio (LR+) is 4.62 and negative Likelihood Ratio (LR-) is 0.68. With the cutoff of PCT levels at 0,5 ng/ml and sample cultures positive or negative the analysis found that sensitivity is 72%, specificity is 33%, positive predictive value (PPV) is 0.54, negative predictive value (NPV) is 0.48, positive Likelihood Ratio (LR+) is 1,07 and negative Likelihood Ratio (LR-) is 0.84.",

For the first two and a half years patients were admitted mostly from hospital wards or from other hospitals and less from emergency department. Therefore the ICU was quickly colonized with resistant isolates since the beginning. Our purpose was to study the trends of resistance of gram negative pathogens causing BSI during the first three years of ICU function.METHODS.All patients hospitalized in the ICU over 72 hours, between 4th November 2003 and 31st December 2006 were included in the study. MICs were determined by agar dilution method according to CLSI guidelines. Colistin susceptibility was defined as MIC < 4 \u00b5g/ml by E test methods (according to BSAC).",

We included seventeen patients admitted over a 2-year period for cardiac arrest (12F/5M, age: 47 years [27-57], SAPS II: 79, poisonings: 12/17, extra-hospital: 8/17) unresponsive to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support, without return of spontaneous circulation. ECLS femoral implantation was performed under continuous cardiac massage, using a centrifugal pump connected to a hollow-fiber membrane oxygenator.RESULTS.Stable ECLS was achieved in 14/17 patients. Duration of continuous external cardiac massage was 120 min. Early complications included massive transfusions (N=8) and the need for surgical revision at the cannulation site for bleeding (N=1). On ECLS connection, plasma lactate concentration was 17.6 mmol/l [6.4-39.0], PaO2/FiO2 ratio 259 mmHg, and serum creatinine concentration 17.0 mmol/l [7.2-31.8]. Deaths resulted from multiorgan failure (N=8), thoracic bleeding (N=2), severe sepsis (N=2), and brain death (N=1). Massive hemorrhagic pulmonary edema during CPR (N=6) and major capillary leak syndrome (N=5) were observed. Three cardiotoxic-poisoned patients (18%, CPR duration: 30, 100, and 180 min) were alive at one-year follow-up without sequellae. Two of these patients survived despite elevated plasma lactate concentrations before cannulation (39.and acebutolol (sustained-release preparation, 34 g, 40.2 mg/l), respectively. ECLS was associated with a significantly lower ICU mortality rate than that expected from the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (91.9%, p=0.02) and lower than the maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (>90%).CONCLUSION.Emergency ECLS is feasible in medical ICU and should be considered as a resuscitative tool for selected patients suffering from refractory cardiac arrest.OBSERVING THE HEMODYNAMIC EFFECTS OF AN END-EXPIRATORY PAUSE FOR PREDICTING FLUID RESPONSIVENESSX.

Patients and method: We included 76 shocked patients considered for volume expansion or infusion of dobutamine. Measurements were performed at baseline and after saline infusion (500 mL over 15 minutes) in 64 patients and after infusion of dobutamine in 12 patients. Using TTE we measured the indexed LVEDA (LVEDAi), E/A, E/Ea, DTE, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), velocity time integral of aortic blood flow (VTIAo) and the diameter of the aortic orifice. The indexed SV (SVi) was calculated as the ratio of the product of the VTIAo by the aortic valve area (\u03a0 diameter2/4) over the body surface. An increase in SVi \u226515% after volume expansion or after dobutamine infusion defined a responder patient.RESULTS.In responders to fluid (n=35), fluid induced a significant increase in LVEDAi from 12.7\u00b12.4 to 13.4\u00b12.0 cm2/m2, in E/Ea from 6.0\u00b12.3 to 6.6\u00b11.9 and a decrease in DTE from 195\u00b146 to 166\u00b143 while E/A did not change (from 1.1\u00b10.4 to 1.2\u00b10.6).

Semiquantitative cultures were obtained if the catheter was kept in place more than 48 hours and it was no longer necessary, the catheter was withdrawn because of fever of unknown origin or an infection was suspected at the point of insertion. Every catheter site, culture and germ was registered in our patient data base. We studied the following variables: type of catheter, site and results of cultures. Statistical analysis: variables were compared by Chi-square. A p< 0,05 was considered statiscally significant. RESULTS. A total of 2.407 catheters were registered (venous catheters 1307, arterial 1100). Rate of germs was as follow: gram-positive 67,4%, gram-negative 28,1%, fungi 3%, contaminated flora 1,5%. Site and germs were not statistically associated. Table 1 shows type, site and rate of infection of cultured catheters. Femoral arteries were more frequently cultured than radial arteries (p< 0,001); no differences were found for cultured venous catheters. Femoral arteries were infected more frequently than radial (p< o,001); yugular and femoral venous catheters were more frequently associated to infection.

The major risk factors in NEC include prematurity, hypoxia, enteral feeding, and bacterial colonization. These factors predispose at-risk infants to an exaggerated intestinal inflammatory response leading to ischemic bowel necrosis. Experimentally induced ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) of the intestine is a model which can be appropriately used to imitate NEC. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), erdosteine (ERD) and alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) are well-known antioxidants with similar structural properties. In the present study, the effectiveness of these three sulfur-based antioxidants against intestinal I/R-injury was evaluated.METHODS. 40 one month old male Spraque-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8 for each): I/R (control), I/R+NAC, I/R+ERD, I/R+ALA and sham-operated group without I/R. Animals were operated at a temperature of 24 o C under ketamine anesthesia. Ischemia was provided by occluding the superior mesenteric artery via a microvascular clamp. Collateral vessels of the small intestine were ligated to prevent collateral circulation. 30 min of ischemia was followed by 30 min of reperfusion. NAC (100 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was administered first 30 min before operation and followed once daily for 5 days.

CONCLUSION. Interestingly, as a whole, most items were highly wished in a booklet, suggesting that 50-70% of relatives express a plea for transparency in face of \"difficult ICU issues\", without taboo. Only the \"yes score\" to \"ICU rules\" items correlated with patient status whereas items from other topics did not. This sounds, as relatives visiting the most severe patients may consider visiting rules as crucial. Other items did not correlate to profiles, and may thereby be considered as societal standard requirements in terms of information. ",

Albumin content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) separately for each LL and RL, and lung weight were measured. Protein content in BALF was calculated as (mg of protein)/(ml of BALF)/(g of lung dry weight). All the data were compared by Wilcoxon's rank-sum or Mann-Whitney U-test and expressed as mean +/-SD.",

Suprisingly, the best positive predictive value (64.0 %) was found on the day of admission, the worst (25.0 %) on day 7; the difference was not significant (p=0.17 with chi-square test). This result could be explained by the fact that most patients in the study group were ventilated on day 7, but only a few on day 14.CONCLUSION. Prediction of prolonged mechanical ventilation was found to be very inaccurate, and did not improve in the course of first week of treatment. However, in our department where many neurosurgical patients are treated, only a minority could be extubated within 7 days when long-term ventilatory support was predicted. As selection of patients who need tracheostomy seems not to be better after one week of treatment than at an early stage, there can be a reason for early tracheostomy if we anticipate prolonged arteficial ventilation.",

Then, depth of anesthesia was decreased to allow spontaneous breathing, and animals were ventilated with two different modes (1 hour each, random sequence): 1) traditional PSV, with pressure support level set at CPAPhigh -CPAPlow; 2) noisy PSV, with random variation of pressure support and mean value set at CPAPhigh -CPAPlow, and standard deviation set at 30 % of the mean value (normal distribution). Gas exchange, inspiratory drive (P0.1) and inspiratory pressure time product of esophageal pressure (PTP) were assessed.

APRV was the named mode in 39 (76%) studies, BIPAP in 11 (22%), and inverse mandatory pressure release ventilation in one study. Extreme inverse inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio was used in 18 (46%) APRV compared to 0 BIPAP studies (p =0.001); 8 (20%) APRV and 1(9%) BIPAP studies used mild inverse ratio (up to 2:1). A 1:1 ratio was used more often with BIPAP (7, 64% vs 12, 31%, p =0.06) as was a normal I:E ratio (3, 27% vs 2, 5%, p =0.04). In adult studies, mean inspiratory pressure was 24cmH2O (APRV) and 18cmH2O (BIPAP) (p=0.3). Mean expiratory pressure was 5.5cmH2O for both modes (p=0.9). Seven APRV studies described synchronisation, 3 (43%) stated the mode did not synchronise to patient effort. All 4 BIPAP studies that described synchronisation stated it was available.CONCLUSION. APRV assumes inverse ratio ventilation (IRV). Some studies advocate extreme IRV with short release times to improve gas exchange, haemodynamic stability, renal and splanchnic blood flow(1). Extreme IRV was used in only 46% of APRV studies, 31% described an I:E ratio of 1:1. Further, ventilator settings used for studies of APRV may be indistinguishable from BIPAP studies (2, 3) . Given the variation in ventilatory settings described, uncertainty of optimal settings may exist. Commercial ventilator branding may further add to confusion. Generic naming of ventilatory modes, as with drug prescribing, combined with consistent definitions of the parameters that define the modes, may avoid confusion, improve consistency of patient response and assist the implementation of these modes into clinical practice. PAV is intended to normalize neuro-ventilatry coupling by assisting each breath in proportion to patient effort, but requires reliable measurements of elastance (E) and resistance (R). PAV+ allows to (a) automatically and non invasively measure E and R, and (b) continuously adjust ventilatory support accordingly. Aim of our study was to test the physiological effects of PAV+ versus CMV (ARDSnet lung protective strategy) in a model of ARDS.",

The impact of PAV+ on ventilator induced lung injury deserves further investigation.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. University of Bari. INTRODUCTION. The major advantage of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) is delivery of smaller tidal volumes to an optimally recruited lung. Assuming there is a save window in the pressure volume curve of the lung between a lower zone with atelectasis and a upper zone with overdistension, surpassing this zone would result in either cyclic recruitment and decrecruitment, overdistension, or both. In diseased lungs this safe window may be too small to harbor the relatively large tidal volumes of CMV. CO2 removal (V'CO2) and therefore PaCO2 is a function of frequency (f) and alveolar delivered tidal volume (Vt): V'CO2 = f x Vt 2 . It is an inherent technical feature of all oscillators that Vt at maximal power decreases as frequency increases. In addition, pressure swings fall down the endotracheal tube and the airways. This fall in pressure swings is a function of frequency and mechanical properties of the respiratory system. As a result of both phenomena Vt delivered to the alveoli decreases substantially at higher frequencies. Up till now oscillation is set at a fixed frequency, in adults at 5 Hz, in children and neonates at 10 Hz. PaCO2 is regulated by adjusting the power, and thus the pressure swings (delta P) and the delivered volume. If the maximum power has been reached, decreasing the frequency can lower the PaCO2 further.",
