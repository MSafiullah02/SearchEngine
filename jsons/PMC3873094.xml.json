Patients with hypomorphic RAG1 mutations may present with a combination of increased susceptibility to infections and autoimmunity [4\u20137] or granulomatous disease [7\u20139]. These hypomorphic mutations result in decreased RAG1 activity, the production of low-affinity self-reactive antibodies, increased autoantibody production and moderate immune deficiency [6]. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), autoimmune neutropenia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, vitiligo, psoriasis, Guillian-Barre syndrome and granulomatous dermatitis have been reported [7].",

Biopsy of the fibula revealed sterile necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Serologic and antigen testing for Toxoplasma, Bartonella, Brucella, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Aspergillus, Syphilis, CMV, EBV, Pneumocystis, Legionella, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia were negative. Treatment for mycobacteriosis was reinitiated with clarlithromycin, ethambutol and moxifloxicin without improvement. Immunologic assessment revealed elevated serum IgG [2480 mg/dL (423-1187)] and IgA [381 mg/dL (22-157)] with a normal IgM and IgE. He made protective antibody titers to tetanus, varicella and polio virus but poor responses to pneumococcal antigens. Reassessment of response to immunization with 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination was not performed due to continued immune suppressive drug regimens. When tested at ages 9 and 10 years, he made normal T cell lymphoproliferative responses to PWM, ConA, VZV, tetanus; equivocal responses to candida and CMV and negative responses to Herpes simplex virus and Adenovirus.

Treatment with rituximab resulted in no improvement in the diffuse granulomatous disease, but his AIHA did improve. Treatment with infliximab at 10 mg/kg/dose was associated with significant improvement in his lung disease with partial improvement in his bone lesions. At the age of 12, he developed a diffuse erythematous rash. Histology showed dense lymphohistiocytic dermal infiltrate with a thin layer of parakeratosis, multifocal spongiosis without acanthosis, eosinophils or granulomas in the epidermis. At age 11 he succumbed to rapidly progressive pneumonia due to H1N1 infection with ARDS and subsequent multi-organ system failure.

This led to the identification of non-synonymous variations in 12 genes (RBM15, C1orf111, OBSCN, PDS5A, PCDHA2, ANKRD26, RAG1, HEPHL1, DNAH3, KLKBL4, ZNF208). Only RAG1 mutations have been associated with autoimmune cytopenia, vitiligo and sterile granulomatous disease [7]. The c.2095C>T RAG1 variation was verified by Sanger resequencing as homozygous in the affected child; heterozygous in both parents, heterozygous in one sibling and absent in the other sibling. PolyPhen-2 v2.2.2r398 predicts the p.Arg699Trp variant protein to be probably damaging [http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/ggi/pph2].This mutation is in the heptamer binding region of RAG1 which has been previously reported in a compound heterozygous state in a patient with Omenn syndrome and a child with autoimmune phenomena [7, 19].

Our patient had low but present B and T cells, produced excess levels of IgG and retained the ability to make functional antibody to protein antigens demonstrating that there was residual RAG activity in his lymphocytes. His ability to make NK cells is consistent with RAG deficiency and may be due to a compensatory expansion in this setting of immune dysregulation [20, 21]. Genetic studies on this boy demonstrated uniform homozygosity on the X chromosome which argues against maternal engraftment as an explanation for the residual RAG function.
