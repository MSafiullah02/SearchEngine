As of April 13, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had reported 1,773,084 laboratory-confirmed cases and 111,652 deaths globally [1]. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is currently unknown. This perspective paper anticipates the significant influence of COVID-19 on HCT recipients given their immunocompromised state, presence of other medical comorbidities, and concerns for higher infection-related severity and mortality, and also reviews the substantial impact of COVID-19 on the HCT-related healthcare system. To address these challenges, novel care approaches and ways to assimilate and share information in the background of rapid change are critically needed. Therefore, the concept of learning networks as interactive platforms for effectively assimilating and distributing evolving information to transplantation centers is introduced [2].",

The origin of the virus causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is currently unconfirmed, although emergence from an animal reservoir has been proposed [5,6]. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from affected patients identified a previously unobserved coronavirus (CoV), initially referred to as novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) [5]. The genome sequence of this 2019-nCoV was confirmed to be structurally related to other CoVs, including 89% identical to the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-like CoV) and 82% identical to human SARS-CoV-1; thus, the virus was renamed SARS-CoV-2 7, 8, 9. SARS-CoV-2 is also similar to other zoonotic CoVs causing global outbreaks of severe respiratory illnesses, such as SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and has been confirmed to be transmitted from human to human [10].",

In this regard, the reported household transmission rate is estimated to be 15% [14]. The virus\u2019s basic reproduction number (R0), an epidemiologic metric describing transmissibility in terms of the average number of cases that could be caused by 1 infected patient in a susceptible population [15], has been estimated as 1.4 to 3.0 [16], compared with \u223c1.2 to 3 for seasonal influenza R0, \u223c12 to 17 for pertussis R0, and \u223c12 to 18 for measles R0 [15,17]. The COVID-19 case fatality risk (CFR) is estimated to be in the range of .25% to 4.7% [18,19], with the highest mortality reported in older adults with comorbidities and varying by geographic location [20]. Preliminary data from the United States suggest high fatality in persons age \u226585 years (CFR \u223c10% to 27%), lower CFR in persons age 65 to 84 years (\u223c3% to 11%), and further declines in younger age groups (CFR \u223c1% to 3% in 55- to 64-year-olds, <1% in 20- to 54-year-olds) [21,22]. A striking finding in these data is the proportion of severe disease and hospitalization in younger adults (age 45 to 64 years), which contrasts with the Chinese experience [21].",

Interestingly, risk factors for endemic human CoV strains (eg, 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) vary based on age. Although endemic CoV was frequently detected in pediatric HCT recipients, low absolute lymphocyte count was not associated with progression to LRTD or severe LRTD, but level of immunosuppression was [37]. Among adult HCT recipients with endemic CoV, 34 of 112 (30%) progressed to LRTD, with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), corticosteroids, hypoalbuminemia, and older age associated with disease progression [38].",

Clinical judgment to guide testing is based on the presence of signs/symptoms compatible with COVID-19, disease severity, and local epidemiologic patterns of the disease. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion to test patients who present with fever and/or lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms and have either recently traveled from an area of high community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence or have been exposed to a close contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the previous 14 days [53,54]. A close contact is defined as being within 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period or having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case [55]. In addition, patients with severe LRT disease of unclear etiology should be considered for testing. A coronavirus self-checker is now available to help guide patients through the process [56]. If a patient is considered a person under investigation (PUI) based on geographic [55] or healthcare [57] exposure, clinicians should immediately institute appropriate infection precautions (see details below) and notify their state and local health departments.",

Therefore, RT-PCR assays have been developed to improve the sensitivity of diagnostic testing; however, these also have limitations, as reviewed previously. For initial testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing upper respiratory tract specimens (NP swabs) in all PUIs. In patients with a productive cough, sputum may be tested, but procedures that generate aerosols are discouraged. For example, BAL sampling is considered high-risk for aerosol dissemination and is not recommended in patients known to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 unless a co-infection is suspected. In patients receiving mechanical ventilation, LRT aspirate can be obtained. Chest imaging should be considered in patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with LRT symptoms. Research is ongoing to improve diagnostic strategies, including more rapid, point-of-care PCR tests [58] and serologic assays to identify patients still at risk [59].",

Children at higher risk for severe COVID-19, defined as necessitating hospitalization or intensive care, include those with cardiovascular and chronic lung disease, infants age <1 year, and immunocompromised patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy [101]. Radiographic changes in children are reportedly similar to those seen in adults, with ground-glass and patchy opacities the most common finding [102,103].

Specifically, donor screening by symptoms and exposure should be done at the time of donor clearance and before product collection. Donor exclusion is based on the donor having COVID-19 at the time of screening or product collection. Given the notable overlap in symptoms among community respiratory viruses [112], respiratory multiplex PCR testing in addition to SARS-CoV-2 testing should be performed if the donor manifests respiratory symptoms. Additional considerations for donors include access to screening and collection centers, which may be impeded by travel restrictions and closures. Therefore, a donor backup plan is important, and frequent communication with the collection center is vital to ensure donor eligibility and to plan for alternative donors as needed [113]. The use of alternative donors, including umbilical cord blood and haploidentical donors, may be worth considering, particularly given the similar outcomes with these sources as with matched unrelated donor transplants.",

One form of government support could be incentivizing industry with a fast-track approval process. Likewise, healthcare institutions need to provide access to these products for patients, but they can only do so by ensuring a safe work environment for care providers. In response, reallocation of resources and repurposing of manufacturing for PPE production would be supported by the government that could incentivize industry to create PPE garments and masks through grants or tax breaks.

After responding to a survey defining initial focus areas (Figure 4\nA), TALNT users are now providing substantive experiences, documents, and protocols relevant to focus areas and associated goals of the proposed holistic care model (Figure 4B). The network will continue its initial efforts on COVID-19, while longer-term goals include continued expansion, creation of best practices, and production of a quality improvement toolkit that includes online learning modules. In addition, the TALNT has the capacity to collect and share deidentified patient and systems-level data, and so learning among participants can translate into improved outcomes in HCT recipients.",

Ongoing modifications will be necessary with the increasing availability of data about COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients that will better inform individual and system-level care. Clinical personnel and transplantation centers must keep abreast of changing dynamics, evolving SARS-CoV-2 data, and governmental policies and recommendations within the context of their local epidemiology. Open collaboration and communication among institutional infectious disease, infection control, and prevention teams within transplantation centers and local and state health departments will be vital to providing optimal care to all patients, especially those at greatest risk for severe COVID-19.",
