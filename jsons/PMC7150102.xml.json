The highest risk of death is at the youngest ages, with neonatal deaths accounting for a greater proportion of deaths in all regions of the world, reflecting an urgent need to focus resources not only on the young child, but also on the pregnancy and peripartum period. To address the goals of health, equity and development, 189 heads of state signed the Millennium Declaration consisting of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000.1 The goals defined included specific targets eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality and empowering women; reducing child mortality rates; improving maternal health; combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensuring environmental sustainability; and developing a global partnership for development, all by the target date of 2015. These MDGs form a blueprint agreed to by all the world's countries and leading development institutions. They have galvanized unprecedented efforts to meet the needs of the world's poorest people. The MDGs break down into 21 targets that are measured by 60 indicators. Working together, governments, the UN and partners, the private sector and civil society have succeeded in saving many lives and improving conditions for many more, but with the deadline approaching rapidly, it is essential to monitor both achievements and progress towards the MDGs in order to map which indicators need additional efforts.",

A discussion of child survival also requires consideration of two other MDGs, because of their impact on child health.\u2022MDG 1: Reduce by half the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and people who suffer from hunger, by 2015.\u2022MDG 7: Reduce by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation and achieve a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2015.The MDG 7 of environmental sustainability has far-reaching consequences towards climate change, agricultural productivity and food security, the latter being important in preventing hunger and malnutrition and thus safe-guarding two other vital goals, i.e. MDG 4 and MDG 5, effectively reducing both child and maternal mortality. In essence, the scope of one goal reaches beyond its own effect and provides solutions, which impact other goals. By investing in national programmes that provide dignified access to facilities for the poor and the marginalized, a link between MDG 1 and MDGs 4 and 5 can be established wherein the fulfilment of the former goal can effectively serve to deliver the latter two goals. Essentially, simple interventions at the policy level can serve more complex tasks at the level of implementation.",

Babies born before 33 weeks' gestation or with birth weight under 1500 g are more likely to need advanced care, especially for breathing problems and feeding. These babies should receive care in a referral hospital, if possible. Pre-term birth acts both as a risk factor for mortality as well as a direct cause of death.10 According to the International Classification of Disease, the direct cause of death is only attributed to pre-term birth if the death results from complications specific to pre-term birth or is in a severely pre-term baby. If a moderately pre-term baby has an infection and dies, the death is most appropriately attributed to infection and pre-term birth acts as a risk factor.

It is estimated that around 23% of all newborn deaths are caused by birth asphyxia, with a large proportion of these being stillbirths. The incidence of birth asphyxia has reduced significantly following improvements in primary and obstetric care in most industrialized countries and accounts for less than 0.1% of newborn infant deaths. In developing countries, rates of birth asphyxia are much higher, ranging from 4.6/1000 in Cape Town to 7\u201326/1000 in Nigeria and case fatality rates may be 40% or higher. Exact epidemiological data are lacking and the precise burden of severe neurological disability in developing countries is unknown. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 4 and 9 million newborns develop birth asphyxia each year. Of those, an estimated 1.2 million die and at least the same number develop severe consequences, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy and developmental delay. The numbers of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for birth asphyxia estimated by WHO exceed those due to all childhood conditions preventable by immunization. Community-based data on disability in less developed settings are lacking and studies reliably assessing the cause are virtually non-existent. This makes the estimates essentially uncertain.",

One of the major difficulties in collecting accurate epidemiological data on birth asphyxia is the lack of a standard definition of the condition. This has added to the difficulties in assessing the true burden of the condition, especially at the community level. Historically, asphyxia was categorized into two grades of severity; asphyxia pallida and livida, signifying varying degrees of affliction. Infants with asphyxia pallida or pale asphyxia were generally regarded as more severely affected, requiring immediate resuscitation. This definition was, however, replaced by more objective measures such as the Apgar score, proposed in 1952.11 The Apgar score is universally accepted on the basis that a low score, especially at 5 min, can predict survival. The Apgar score has come under criticism for its inability to correctly diagnose perinatal asphyxia and predict long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities.12, 13 The seemingly weak relationship between low Apgar scores and several indicators of perinatal asphyxia is not surprising, since the Apgar score was not intended to be a measure of perinatal asphyxia. Just as the Apgar score alone is a poor predictor of outcome, metabolic acidosis in isolation has also proved to be a poor predictor of significant perinatal brain injury. Similarly, a combination of low Apgar score and acidosis at birth was found to have poor predictive value for neonatal neurological morbidity.14 According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, a neonate is labelled to be asphyxiated if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) Umbilical cord arterial pH <7; (2) Apgar score of 0\u20133 for longer than 5 min; (3) Neonatal neurological manifestations (e.g. seizures, coma or hypotonia); and (4) Multisystem organ dysfunction, e.g. cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, haematological, pulmonary or renal system. Thus, hypoxia or asphyxia should be labelled as a cause of disability and handicap only when the neonate demonstrates the four perinatal findings listed above and in whom other possible causes of neurological damage have been excluded. In the absence of such evidence, subsequent neurological deficiencies cannot be ascribed to perinatal asphyxia or hypoxia.",

In developed countries where intrapartum complications are rare events, cases of perinatal asphyxia are more commonly related to antepartum causes or to the superimposition of intrapartum insults over an already at-risk situation. Given the higher incidence of serious complications in labour and reduced availability of skilled care during delivery, intrapartum causes account for a larger proportion of cases in developing countries. The consequences of asphyxia range from no ill effects to multi-organ complications and death. This huge variation in the outcome diverges with the severity and duration of asphyxia. Despite identification of many possible predictors of outcome, little is known of the long-term developmental outcome of asphyxiated term neonates.16 Furthermore, the evaluation of long-term outcome is stalled by the lack of a consensus on standard case definitions of birth asphyxia, difficulties in assessing asphyxia in non-hospital births and in measuring disabilities, especially among young children and the difficulty of attributing aetiology in the wake of malnutrition and disease.17\n",

Cerebral palsy is a chronic non-progressive neuromuscular condition that results in muscular spasticity or paralysis and may have associated mental retardation. Earlier studies concluded that up to 50% of cerebral palsy was attributable to birth asphyxia. Further studies reduced this figure to under 10% of cases. Clinical epidemiological studies also show that in most cases, the events leading to cerebral palsy occur in the fetus before the onset of labour or in the newborn after delivery.20 With the importance ascribed in the past to hypoxia in asphyxia and the role of oxygen in resuscitation, the relationship of asphyxia to cerebral palsy may also be related to aggressive and inappropriate treatment strategies.",

Three-quarters of neonatal deaths occur during this period; early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) is typically defined as sepsis occurring within the first 3 or 7 days after birth. Seven days is typically used for Group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis; 3 days is more commonly used in epidemiological studies.22\n",

Limited community-based surveillance and inadequate laboratory resources to identify EONS hinder assessment of the burden of disease.23 Most of the available information comes from Demographic and Health Surveys, which are believed to underreport early neonatal deaths. Precise diagnosis of EONS and EONS-related deaths is further complicated by the uncertainties involved in distinguishing the clinical syndrome of sepsis from those of birth asphyxia and prematurity in the early neonatal period. Because hospitals in developing countries with high neonatal mortality capture only a small proportion of all cases of neonatal sepsis, the data do not reflect population-based incidence estimates. Other factors responsible for uncer\u00adtainty in the data, include the lack of standardization of case ascertainment, limited laboratory facilities for blood culture, problems with sensitivity of blood cultures in detecting true bacteraemia in neonates and inherent limitations of verbal autopsy tools, which make the cause of death unclear for most neonatal deaths in developing countries. Three studies reported incidence of culture-confirmed EONS, which ranged from 2.2 to 9.8 per 1000 live births. The fourth study reported the incidence of clinical EONS of 20.7 per 1000 live births.24, 25, 26, 27 A more recent study from Bangladesh reported the incidence of EONS observed during a home-based newborn surveillance programme. The rate of clinical EONS was 50 per 1000 live births and blood culture-confirmed EONS was 2.9 per 1000 live births. All of these studies were from the South Asian region. Two of the studies also reported case fatality rates for EONS in the range of 18\u201319%.",

Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were more common in East Asia, Pacific and South Asian countries and S. aureus was uncommon in East Asia and Latin America, as compared with other regions. Although GBS is one of the predominant organisms causing EONS in developed countries, it was uncommon in developing countries. In developing countries, South Asia had the lowest rates of GBS. The reason for this difference in distribution of GBS between developed and developing countries is not clearly understood. Stoll and Schuchat31 reviewed 34 studies published between 1980 and 1996 that evaluated GBS colonization rates in women in developing countries. Studies using adequate culture methods found differences in the prevalence of colonization in different regions (Middle East/North Africa, 22%; Asia/Pacific, 19%; sub-Saharan Africa, 19%; Americas, 14%; and India/Pakistan, 12%). Other factors contributing to observed differences in GBS rates in different populations include strain virulence, maternally derived antibody levels or cultural practices. Another reason for lack of information could be that in developing countries GBS is a very early-onset illness causing death within a few hours of birth, it is possible that data miss the vast majority of GBS cases.",

Another important cause is the reduced rates of optimal breast-feeding. Only about 40% of children under 6 months of age are exclusively breast-fed. Malnutrition has a bidirectional relationship with diarrhoea. It reduces the immunity and makes children susceptible to infections, including diarrhoea and can also be caused as a result of persistent or severe diarrhoea.36 Childhood malnutrition is prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. According to an estimate, 20% of children <5 years of age in these countries are underweight (weight for age Z score <\u22122). The prevalence of both underweight is highest in Africa and South-Central Asia. Most children with diarrhoea are not managed appropri\u00adately, with only around one-third of them given oral rehydration solution (ORS). Moreover, despite the evidence of benefit, widespread introduction of zinc for diarrhoea treatment has been limited. UNICEF's zinc procurement began in 2006 and has increased substantially. Despite this progress, global zinc supply is dismally low compared with global need.",

Preventive strategies can be implemented in all cases and in at-risk populations (Figure 80.10\n). However, the key to treating neonatal infections successfully in community settings is the appropriate rapid diagnosis and triage to therapy. The onset of illness and course of progression is much more rapid in newborns, thus both clinical diagnosis, as well as empirical therapy are the mainstay for management of neonatal sepsis.47 Appropriate strategies are needed for prevention of infections, as well as interventions for the domiciliary care and referral of newborn infants who develop bacterial infections. In several resource-poor situations, where prompt referral to a facility is not possible, health workers may have no alternative but to provide domiciliary care, which entails visiting households to provide care for the treatment of serious neonatal bacterial infections (Table 80.4\n). To prevent EONS in low-resource settings, cost-effective interventions must be introduced at the community level, with prevention strategies applied during the antenatal, intrapartum and early neonatal period. It is estimated that implementation of these interventions with coverage of 99% can prevent 41\u201372% of neonatal deaths globally.

Early and exclusive breast-feeding should be encouraged in developing country settings, since it is perhaps the most important postnatal intervention to prevent EONS.48 Hygienic newborn care also needs to be encouraged to prevent infections in the early neonatal period. This includes sanitary disposal of waste, provision of clean water in homes and hand washing by care providers. Appropriate cord and skin care is also essential with recent trials showing the benefit of cord and skin cleansing with chlorhexidine. Similarly, massage of newborns with topical sunflower oil, a traditional practice in some communities, has been shown to produce substantial reductions in hospital-acquired neonatal infections among pre-term infants in randomized controlled trials in developing countries. Kangaroo care by mothers is another intervention that can decrease EONS. Kangaroo care involves skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant in a strict vertical position between a mother's breasts and frequent and exclusive breast-feeding. Kangaroo care provides the benefits of increasing body temperature and weight of the child and reducing the stress level of the infant. These factors, combined with the increased rate of exclusive breast-feeding, might be responsible for the lower rates of infections in neonates receiving kangaroo care.",

Indoor air pollution in developing countries is due largely to the use of solid fuels for cooking or heating purposes in poorly ventilated and closed home units. Material used most often for fuels to light fires and stoves in most rural and many urban areas include wood, crop waste, animal dung and coal. Statistics show that around 3 billion people worldwide use solid fuels as their main cooking fuel and more recent studies show that the use of this solid fuel contributes to as many as 2 million premature and preventable deaths, with as many as half of them attributable to childhood pneumonia alone. The use of these solid fuels is disproportionally higher in rural areas as compared with urban households. Now, with increased spending in research, newer technologies have become available that can reduce indoor air pollution that may help prevent pneumonia.
