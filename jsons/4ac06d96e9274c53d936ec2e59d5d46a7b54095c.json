The membraneproximal end of MHC-I CD forms an extended strand that augments the \u00b51 \u03b2-sheets at the side of the cargo recognition site, with Tyr320 of the MHC-I CD in the tyrosine-binding pocket of \u00b51. The binding is secured by the proline-rich strand (PxxP repeats) of Nef, which runs along the MHC-I CD to form the other arm of the clamp. Nef is further affixed to \u00b51 by extensive contacts at the core domain and by crucial electrostatic interactions involving its acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65). The C terminus of Nef, together with a region of \u00b51 that is disordered in an earlier structure 22 , forms a snug pocket at one end of the binding groove to cradle a tight turn of the MHC-I CD (residues 327-332; Fig. 1c ). The two membrane-anchoring points, the N termini of the MHC-I CD and Nef, are located on the same side of the complex, consistent with their membrane attachment roles in vivo.",

The C-terminal domain of \u00b51 (residues 158-423) remains as a banana-shaped structure of mostly \u03b2-strands 22 , with a slight twist (~10\u00b0) along its long axis upon formation of complex (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). An unstructured region of \u00b51 (residues 218-231) becomes ordered to interact with both Nef and the MHC-I CD. The core domain of Nef has the same structure as seen earlier, whereas the functionally important acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65) and the PxxP repeats (residues 68-78) swing to a different trajectory to interact with \u00b51 (Supplementary Fig. 1) . The N-terminal helix of Nef is observed for the first time to be attached to the protein's core, on the side opposite the MHC-I-binding site (Fig. 1) . Much of the Nef N-and C-terminal loops (residues 27-56 and 162-174, respectively) are disordered and not seen in the structure. In addition, the connecting region of the MHC-I CD-Nef fusion protein, including the last nine residues of MHC-I, a two-residue linker (TS) and the first four residues of Nef, is also disordered. This flexible region of 15 residues can span up to 55 \u00c5 in distance, whereas its two ends observed in the structure are only 28 \u00c5 apart, suggesting that the fusion linker probably does not cause distortion of the structure.",

The largest binary interface, 1,058 \u00c5 2 , occurs between Nef and \u00b51 and falls into the category of weak, transient binding 24 . The MHC-I-\u00b51 and MHC-I-Nef interfaces bury 771 \u00c5 2 and 437 \u00c5 2 , respectively, predicting that no binary complexes would form with MHC-I. In contrast, all three components together generate a total of 2,266 \u00c5 2 buried area in a strong three-protein complex. This analysis also suggests a possible sequence of binding events. The association between Nef and AP1 may take place first, as their buried surface area predicts the only probable binary binding event. The binding groove would then be created at the Nef-\u00b51 interface to sequester the MHC-I CD. Consistent with this scenario, we found that the Nef-\u00b51 binary complex can form at high protein concentrations (~30 \u00b5M; Supplementary Fig. 2) , although this interaction is not strong enough to be detected by in vitro pull-down assay 10 . This is corroborated by the weak, binary interaction between Nef and \u00b51 (refs. 6, 25) . Moreover, the binding of Nef to \u00b51 is enhanced by the presence of the MHC-I CD 7,10 ; this further supports the cooperative nature of the three-protein interaction.",

The binding geometry closely resembles that of the Yxx\u03c6 peptide binding to \u00b52 of AP2 (Fig. 2a) 14 . However, the lack of a bulky hydrophobic side chain at the Y+3 position (Fig. 2b) in the MHC-I CD (320-YSQA-323) leads to an empty hydrophobic pocket on \u00b51 (Fig. 2c) ; this explains why MHC-I is not recognized by AP1 in the absence of Nef. Nef therefore functions to compensate for this intrinsically defective binding and forces a tight association of the MHC-I CD with AP1.",

This helix, as part of the flexible N terminus of Nef, has been predicted to be detached from the core 32 .

In the region corresponding to the Nef-induced \u00b51 helix-turn structure, a much longer loop exists in \u00b52, which probably does not adopt the same conformation (Supplementary Fig. 4) . \u00b52 also lacks the important tyrosine residue (Tyr374 in \u00b51) that stacks onto Nef Pro72 to stabilize the sharp Nef turn (Figs. 2 and 5) . Furthermore, \u00b52 does not have the essential basic patch that attracts the Nef acidic cluster to secure formation of complex. Indeed, the Nef-MHC-I CD construct did not interact with \u00b52 in our in vitro pull-down experiments (Fig. 5c) . These differences highlight an important distinction between the two otherwise highly homologous \u00b5 subunits in AP1 and AP2, which may contribute to different interactions with distinct cellular sorting proteins and cargos. The lack of interaction between Nef and \u00b52 also could explain why Nef uses a distinct mode of interaction-involving its acidic dileucine motif and the \u03b1 and \u03c32 subunits of AP2-to downregulate CD4 (refs. 33,34) .",

There is a striking coplanar arrangement of the Nef N-terminal myristoylation site, the MHC-I CD membrane-proximal end and multiple phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) binding sites on AP2 (ref. 35) , consistent with formation of complex along the lipid bilayer in vivo. The coplanar arrangement of all the membrane attachment sites indicates that this model is likely to be accurate. Through myristoylation and anchoring of its N-terminal helix to the core, Nef is positioned at an optimal distance from the lipid membrane to bind the AP1 complex; this probably occurs after recruitment of AP1 to the membrane by the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (refs. 36,37) . The Nef-\u00b51 interaction may also contribute to inducing the active, open conformation of AP1 through electrostatic attractions resembling those involving the PIP 2 -containing membranes 35 . This interaction probably further stabilizes the membrane association of AP1, as we have reported earlier 38 . The association of Nef and AP1 then creates a snug binding groove for recruitment of the MHC-I CD and ultimately leads to packaging of MHC-I into the clathrin-coated vesicle.",

Perhaps owing to its highly cooperative nature, the interaction is very delicate: mutation of any of its key elements disrupts the complex and causes loss of Nef activity. This explains the observation that virtually every domain in Nef required for modulation of MHC-I is also required for coimmunoprecipitation of the two proteins from human cells 26 . Moreover, our model explains why the dileucine motif in the C terminus of native Nef is not active during downregulation of MHC-I, yet is functional as a trafficking signal when Nef is fused to the CD of MHC-I 39 . Our structure shows that the cooperative Nef-MHC-I CD-\u00b51 ternary interaction is key to recruitment of MHC-I to AP1. This conformation, however, precludes the involvement of the dileucine motif of Nef, as the binding site for [ED]xxxL[LI] motifs on the \u03b3 and \u03c31 subunits of AP1 (ref. 40) is too distant (Fig. 6) . In contrast, when MHC-I is covalently linked to Nef, the critical MHC-I recruitment step is bypassed, and any trafficking signal in Nef, including the dileucine motif, can contribute to trafficking of the MHC-I-Nef fusion protein. Nevertheless, the principle of cooperative binding probably also applies to the mechanism by which Nef modulates CD4 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and AP2 (ref. 41) , even though that interaction involves the dileucine motif of Nef and the \u03b1 and \u03c32 subunits of AP2 rather than \u00b52.",

            "text": "Our structure supports the notion that Nef is a virally encoded clathrin-associated sorting protein (CLASP) that alters the breadth and specificity of cargo recognition by adaptor protein complexes 12 . The cooperative binding mechanism by which Nef enables an adaptor protein complex to recognize a suboptimal sorting sequence could be used by cellular CLASPs. For example, in mouse MHC-I, the tyrosine residue corresponding to Tyr320 is required for 'cross-presentation' of exogenous antigens by dendritic cells, an event required for priming of antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes 42 . This observation, together with the role of Tyr320 in Nef-mediated modulation of MHC-I via AP1, has led us and others to speculate that cross-presentation might involve AP-1 and a cellular CLASP that is reminiscent of HIV-1 Nef 8, 9 . Moreover, the positively charged clusters on \u00b51 that contribute to the interaction between Nef and the MHC-I CD may function as binding sites for the acidic trafficking motifs of cellular proteins. For example, the cytoplasmic domain of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor contains acidic clusters that include glutamic acid, aspartic acid and phosphoserine residues, and these sequences contribute to interaction with AP1 (ref. 43) .",

Bonifacino, NIH) was cloned into multiple cloning site 1 of the pCDFDuet vector (Novagen). A severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) main protease (M pro ) cleavage site 44, 45 was introduced between the N-terminal His 6 tag and \u00b51 158-423 . The MHC-I CD-Nef fusion was created as described earlier 10 . The fusion gene was cloned into multiple cloning site 2 of the pCDFDuet vector. The pCDFDuet plasmid encoding both \u00b51 158-423 and CD-Nef genes was expressed in Rosetta cells in Terrific Broth. Cells were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at A 600 of 0.6 and grown at 16 \u00b0C overnight. Proteins were first purified by Ni-NTA resin using the gravity-flow batch method. A subsequent purification step through a HiTrap Q anion exchange column produced the CD-Nef-\u00b51 complex in good purity. The His 6 tag on \u00b51 158-423 was then cleaved off using the SARS-CoV M pro protease 44, 45 . A final gel filtration purification using a Sephadex 200 column yielded homogeneous monomeric CD-Nef-\u00b51 complex. Selenomethionine-derivatized (SeMet) proteins were expressed from the same vector using the methionine biosynthesis inhibition method 46 . Purification of the SeMet derivative of the protein complex was accomplished as described above for the native proteins. For GST pull-down experiments, \u00b51 158-423 was cloned into a pMAT9s expression vector 47 containing a N-terminal His 6 tag followed by maltose-binding protein (MBP) and a SARS-CoV M pro cleavage site. Mouse \u00b52 159-435 of AP2 was cloned into the pMAT9s expression vector in a similar fashion. The pMAT9s-\u00b51 plasmid was coexpressed with the pGro7 vector (Takara Bio), which encodes the groES and groEL chaperone proteins, in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells in Terrific Broth. l-(+)-Arabinose was added to 2 mg ml \u22121 to induce chaperone expression. Expression of MBP-\u00b51 was later induced by 0.1 mM IPTG at A 600 of 0.6 and continued at 16 \u00b0C overnight. The protein was purified to homogeneity by using Ni-NTA gravity flow, HiTrap SP cation exchange column and Sephadex 200 gel filtration column. All MBP-\u00b51 mutants (and the GST-CD-Nef mutants below) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method. The mutants of MBP-\u00b51 158-423 and wild-type MBP-\u00b52 159-435 were expressed and purified similarly as for the wild-type MBP-\u00b51.",

(a) Nef N-terminal helix (blue) is anchored to the core (cyan) via two hydrophobic residues, Trp13 and Met20. (b,c) Mutagenesis verification in vivo (FACS) and in vitro (GST pull-down assay), respectively, of the importance of the two residues. FACS experiments were carried out using human T lymphocytes of cell line SupT1 transfected to express Nef and GFP (as a transfection marker), followed by staining for surface MHC-I. Relative fluorescence intensity of MHC-I versus GFP. Nef, red; negative control (GFP only), blue. Lower left in b, western blots of Nef proteins. Distinct differences between \u00b51 and \u00b52 explain selective use of AP1 over AP2 by Nef for MHC-I downregulation. (a,b) \u00b52 lacks the positively charged surface patch that interacts with the Nef acidic cluster. It also lacks the tyrosine residue that stacks onto Nef Pro72 to stabilize the sharp Nef turn (oval). Model in b was generated by superposing the \u00b52 structure35 onto \u00b51 in the structure of the MHC-I CD-Nef-\u00b51 complex. (c) GST-tagged MHC-I CD-Nef does not pull down \u00b52 in vitro. within it, abolishes Nef-mediated downregulation of MHC-I 9,20,26 .",
