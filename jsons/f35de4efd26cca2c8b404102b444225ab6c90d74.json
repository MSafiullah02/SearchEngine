            "text": "Prediction of transmembrane (TM) proteins from their sequence facilitates functional study of genomes and the search of potential membrane-associated therapeutic targets. Computational methods for predicting TM sequences have been developed. These methods achieve high prediction accuracy for many TM proteins but some of these methods are less effective for specific class of TM proteins. Moreover, their performance has been tested by using a relatively small set of TM and non-membrane (NM) proteins. Thus it is useful to evaluate TM protein prediction methods by using a more diverse set of proteins and by testing their performance on specific classes of TM proteins. This work extensively evaluated the capability of support vector machine (SVM) classification systems for the prediction of TM proteins and those of several TM classes. These SVM systems were trained and tested by using 14962 TM and 12168 NM proteins from Pfam protein families. An independent set of 3389 TM and 6063 NM proteins from curated Pfam families were used to further evaluate the performance of these SVM systems. 90.1% and 86.7% of TM and NM proteins were correctly predicted respectively, which are comparable to those from other studies. The prediction accuracies for proteins of specific TM classes are 95.6%, 90.0%, 92.7% and 73.9% for G-protein coupled receptors, envelope proteins, outer membrane proteins, and transporters/channels respectively; and 98.1%, 99.5%, 86.4%, and 98.6% for non-G-protein coupled receptors, non-envelope proteins, non-outer membrane proteins, and nontransporters/non-channels respectively. Tested by using a significantly larger number and more diverse range of proteins than in previous studies, SVM systems appear to be capable of prediction of TM proteins and proteins of specific TM classes at accuracies comparable to those from previous studies.

Thus computational methods have been developed for facilitating the prediction of TM sequences [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] . These methods are capable of achieving high prediction accuracy for TM proteins and they can satisfactorily distinguish between TM and globular proteins and between TM and signal peptides. A study of 14 TM protein prediction methods using 270 helical TM chains, 1,418 signal peptides and 616 globular proteins showed that \u223c95% TM helices are correctly predicted as TM proteins and \u223c92% of globular proteins are correctly predicted as non-membrane (NM) proteins by the best methods [13] . A more recent study showed that \u223c95% of the 125 TM proteins and \u223c99% of the 526 soluble proteins can be correctly predicted by using a modified algorithm [18] .",

Thus these methods may preferably need to be more adequately tested and trained by using a more diverse set of proteins. Previous studies also revealed that some TM prediction methods tend to predict proteins with more than 5 TM helices at a lower accuracy [13] , which affects their prediction capability for such therapeutically and biologically relevant TM proteins as Gprotein coupled receptors and certain types of channels and transporters [20] .

It was also tested on specific classes of TM proteins. SVM is a relatively new and promising algorithm for binary classification by means of supervised learning and it appears to be more superior than other statistical learning methods [21] . SVM has been applied to the prediction of TM proteins [15, 17] and a specific TM class of G-protein coupled receptors [22] as well as other proteins [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] . These SVM TM protein prediction systems were not trained and tested by using a sufficiently diverse set of TM and NM proteins. Therefore, in this work, a large number of TM and NM proteins were used to train and test a SVM system. SVM systems were also trained and tested for the prediction of therapeutically and biologically important individual classes of TM proteins including G-protein coupled receptors, envelope proteins, outer membrane proteins, and transporters/channels.",

For instance, G-protein coupled receptors contain 7 TM helices as well as intracellular and extracellular domains. Envelope proteins are located in viral lipoprotein membranes which form the outermost layer of the virion in certain viruses. Outer membrane proteins are located in the outer membrane of organelles like mitochondria, chloroplasts and some eubacteria which are surrounded by a double membrane. Almost all TM transport processes are mediated by integral TM proteins, sometimes functioning in conjunction with extracytoplasmic receptors or receptor domains as well as with cytoplasmic energy-coupling and regulatory proteins or protein domains. Thus the four classes of TM proteins have their own characteristics and they are useful for testing the performance of SVM classification.",

All distinct members in each group were used to construct positive samples for training, testing and independent evaluation of SVM classification system. Multiple entries for a distinct protein were evenly distributed to the training, testing, and independent evaluation set. The negative samples, i.e. NM proteins, for training and testing our SVM classification systems were selected from seed proteins of the more than 3886 curated protein families in the Pfam database [32] that have no TM protein as a family member. Each negative set contains at least one randomly selected seed protein from each of the Pfam families. For each sub-group of non-G-protein coupled receptor, non-envelope protein, non-out membrane protein, or nontransporter/non-channel, distinct members in the other four sub-groups were added to the negative samples of each of the training, testing and independent evaluation set. For instance, distinct members of envelope proteins, out membrane proteins, transporters and channels are added into the negative samples of the G-protein coupled receptors. It is expected that the number of negative samples in each of these sub-groups may be higher than that in the group of negative samples for all TM proteins.",

The predicted accuracies for TM proteins, G-protein coupled receptors, envelope proteins, outer membrane proteins, and transporters/channel are 90.1%, 95.6%, 90.0%, 92.7% and 73.9% respectively. The predicted accuracies for NM proteins, non-G-protein coupled receptors, non-envelope proteins, nonouter membrane proteins, and non-transporters/non-channels are 86.7%, 98.1%, 99.5%, 86.4%, and 98.6% respectively. A direct comparison with results from previous protein studies is inappropriate because of the differences in the specific aspects of proteins classified, dataset, descriptors and classification methods. Nonetheless, a tentative comparison may provide some crude estimate regarding the level of accuracy of our method with respect to those achieved by other studies. With the exception of and transporters/channels, the accuracies for various TM classes are comparable to those of \u223c95% obtained from previous studies [13, 18] . The prediction accuracy for transporters and channels is substantially lower primarily because the collected proteins in this class are not sufficiently diverse to adequately train the corresponding SVM classification system. There are 250 identified families of transporters and 115 families of channels, some of which contain substantial number of distinct proteins [20] . Thus the collected 980 transporters and channels are not enough to fully represent all of the identified families.",
