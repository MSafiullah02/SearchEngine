It is therefore necessary to build relationships with the community to ensure enrollment and long-term participation. As a result the study is resource intensive and the study population is limited in terms of both sample size and generalizability. In particular the source population from which participants is drawn is limited geographically to households who are able to travel to the University of Michigan study site for enrollment visits, blood draws and illness specimen collection. The HIVE Study population consists of suburban residents and largely reflects the high education level and vaccination uptake in our region. One approach to increase sample size and generalizability would be to establish multi-site cohorts, presenting logistical considerations that might be challenging to unify under a common protocol.
