Lower respiratory tract infections represent the third leading cause of death in the world, after cardiac and encephalic vascular illnesses; however, in countries of low economic status, they take first place.",

In Chile, they take second place and third place in the leading causes of death in children and adults, respectively. Furthermore, several studies point toward them as the main causes of ambulatory consultations and absenteeism from both school and work. Their seasonal form of appearance and high infectivity place viruses as being responsible for the majority of acute respiratory infections . According to postneonatal mortality estimates, lower respiratory tract infections cause 20% of deaths, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus being most common (9.5%). Advances in viral diagnosis have confirmed the participation of viruses in respiratory pediatric pathology, with frequencies that go from more than 50% (if they compromise the lower respiratory tract) to 90% (if they affect the upper respiratory tract). In adults, the scenario of upper respiratory tract infections is similar, but in lower respiratory tract infections a predominance of bacterial etiologies has been described. However, application of molecular viral diagnosis shows significant participation of respiratory viruses in lower respiratory tract infections. This fact acquires more relevance when considering the aging of a population.",

Some viruses tend to produce infections mainly in the upper respiratory tract (rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus), while others can similarly compromise the lower respiratory airways, with variable severity (adenovirus, RSV, metapneumovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza). In general, it is an accepted fact that any respiratory virus can compromise one or several levels of the respiratory system and cause clinical and subclinical infections, but there is a certain preference of viruses for compromising specific levels of the respiratory system (Table 28.2). In this way, during an epidemic of a virus such as RSV or influenza, the major proportion of upper and lower respiratory tract infections will be caused by the prevalent virus. In addition, there will be an important incidence of subclinical infections, which act as efficient sources of transmission. As a result of herd immunity, important epidemics of multiple different viruses do not usually coexist in a community; instead, they alternate in terms of their presence in the community. For example, in Chile, the most commonly observed pattern involves parainfluenza outbreaks, followed by influenza outbreaks, and then RSV outbreaks; later, during winter\u2013spring, metapneumovirus appears. Thus, the apexes of the epidemics follow one another and rarely overlap unless they affect populations of different ages. This phenomenon of viral interference may be explained by generation of interferon in infected patients, which \u201cinterferes\u201d with the development of an infection of other viruses circulating at the same time.",
