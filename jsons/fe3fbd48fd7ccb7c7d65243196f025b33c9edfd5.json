Pandemics pose the enormous challenge of balancing equality of all people and equity in distribution of risks and benefits among them. (1) In view of this scenario of increasingly frequent cases of COVID-19 in the population, there is an urgent need to evaluate best practices for optimizing the use of available means and resources. Thus, considering the imminent risk of unavailability of intensive care beds and respirators for all individuals, affected or not by the disease, it is essential to establish clinical, technical and ethical criteria for the best use of them, to enhance results and generate the best possible benefits. (2, 3) How can medical resources be allocated more fairly and ethically during the COVID-19 pandemic?",

(8, 9) It should be noted, however, that the primary ethical principle to be considered is respect for human dignity of all individuals. Therefore, everyone should have the right to a medical triage, with fair and transparent objective criteria, in addition to access to appropriate information about their health status, the conditions of the care system and the established criteria. They must also receive all necessary support for their condition within the group they were triaged for. It is noteworthy that the Brazilian State, in addition to having as a foundation the aforementioned principle of human dignity (Art. 1, item III Federal Constitution of 1988), has as a legal obligation, i.e., a goal to be achieved, in this case materialized in the allocation of resources, the principle of solidarity (Art. 3, item I) and nondiscrimination of birth, race, sex, color, age or any other form of discrimination (Art. 3, item IV) (https://www2. senado.leg.br/bdsf/bitstream/handle/id/518231/CF88_ Livro_EC91_2016.pdf).

The initial triage is based on survival criteria, using scores, such as the Clinical Frailty Scale, by Rockwood et al., (11) ( Table 1) . This is a tool to assess physical, cognitive and functional frailty, reflecting both comorbidities and physiological reserve, which can be applied to all adult individuals, regardless of age or type of underlying disease, allowing equity in the assessment. Frailty in ICU patients is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality and also for no home return. (12, 13) The allocation of resources, then, is based on the score of the selected scale, which defines the degree of priority (Table 2) . If there is a tie in the score, the decision may be based on the estimated life years saved, and on the criterion of being a health professional involved in the care of patients with COVID-19. The latter does not mean that the life of this professional is more valuable than the life of other people, but derives from its instrumental value, as part of the workforce to assist in the care of other individuals. Participation in clinical studies related to COVID-19 can also be used as a criterion for resource allocation, as a reward for the willingness to be part of a study that can benefit others.",

(14, 15) Patients with ascending SOFA and, especially, with SOFA >10 should be candidate for therapeutic limitation (e.g., limitation of vasoactive drug (VAD) infusion, hemodialysis, mechanical ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers). According to the patient's response during mechanical ventilation, at least 7 days of therapy are proposed until evaluating respiratory support withdrawal, which must be done by two healthcare professionals who are not directly involved in the patient's care, to increase objectivity and reduce moral stress among the staff. In these situations, it is recommended that the Psychology and Palliative Care teams are called in, in addition to allowing family members to attend the patient's final phase of life (limited to two accompanying persons) in person or by videoconference.",
