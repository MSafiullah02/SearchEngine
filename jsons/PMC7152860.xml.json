Rush graduated from what is now Princeton at age 14, then studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, becoming fluent in multiple languages during his tour of Europe. When he returned in 1769, he set up his medical practice and became a chemistry professor at what is now the University of Pennsylvania, publishing the first American textbook in the field. As an elected delegate to the Continental Congress, Rush was a strong proponent of American independence and encouraged Thomas Paine to write the widely influential \u201cCommon Sense.\u201d He signed the Declaration of Independence.",

When Thomas Jefferson was preparing Lewis and Clark for their epic expedition across the country, he sent them to Rush to obtain necessary medical training and supplies. A staunch abolitionist, Rush argued that blacks were in no way naturally inferior to whites. He also campaigned against capital punishment and promoted the education of women.",

He promoted the engagement of mental patients in activities such as gardening and washing, and he was a strong advocate for the view that alcoholism is a disease. His medical students were so impressed by Rush that they founded Rush Medical College in Chicago, now Rush University Medical Center, in his honor. It was Rush who persuaded former political opponents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson to rekindle their friendship.",

After an incubation period of several days, most patients develop mild symptoms including fever, headache, and anorexia, recovering in less than a week. But approximately 15% of patients enter a second phase with recurrent fever and jaundice, from which the disease derives its name, as well as hemorrhage from the mouth, nose, and eyes, and bloody diarrhea. Among such patients, mortality rates may be as high as 50%. Those who survive generally recover completely, with the added benefit of lifelong immunity to the disease.",

After they take up residence in its salivary glands, they are then transmitted the next time the mosquito bites. Because mosquitoes tend to be active in warmer months, yellow fever outbreaks tend to occur in late summer. Once the virus enters the bloodstream of a human victim, it begins reproducing in lymphatic organs, from which it can infect the cells of the liver. Deaths are often due to the aggressiveness of the host immune response, producing a vicious cycle of escalating immune response sometimes known as \u201ccytokine storm.\u201d",

Initial French efforts were essentially doomed by the disease, eventuating in over 22,000 deaths, and the resulting business failure incited financial turmoil in France. The US eventually succeeded in completing the canal largely through the elucidation of the role of mosquitoes in transmitting the disease, followed by successful eradication efforts.",

Hundreds of people were dying each week, and tens of thousands of people, including national leaders, chose to flee the city. Samuel Breck, a merchant who had newly arrived in the city, described the scene:In private families the parents, the children, the domestics lingered and died, frequently without assistance. The wealthy soon fled; the fearless or indifferent remained from choice, the poor from necessity. The inhabitants were reduced thus to one-half their number, yet the malignant action of the disease increased, so that those who were in health one day were buried the next. The burning fever occasioned paroxysms of rage which drove the patient naked from his bed to the street, and in some instances to the river, where he was drowned. Insanity was often the last stage of its horrors (6).\n",

For example, he urged that decaying food by swept from nearby docks, that sewage be disposed of in a more sanitary matter, and that improved hygiene standards be adopted.

I have bled twice in many and in one acute case four times, with the happiest effect.
