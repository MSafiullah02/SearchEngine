In parallel, we identified adult patients with an ED visit or hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B at our quaternary-care hospital between January 1, 2016 and May 31, 2018, dates during which we had available data from the Cornell Acute Stroke Academic Registry (CAESAR), which we used to ascertain ischemic strokes in the influenza cohort. Influenza is a common viral respiratory illness that has been established as a risk factor for ischemic stroke, 8, 9 so the comparison between Covid-19 and influenza allowed us to estimate whether Covid-19 is associated with a heightened risk of ischemic stroke beyond that expected from a viral respiratory illness. Calendar years 2016-2018 encompassed both severe (2017-2018) and moderate (2015-2016, 2016-2017) influenza seasons. 10 Patients with Covid-19 and influenza were identified using automated systems for electronic capture of laboratory results established by the Weill Cornell Medicine Architecture for Research Computing in Health (ARCH) program.

First, we may have underestimated the true rate of ischemic stroke in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 infection because these patients are sometimes too unstable to undergo brain imaging. In addition, some patients with undiagnosed Covid-19 and stroke may have died before reaching the hospital. Conversely, the recent surge in Covid-19 in New York City could have affected the threshold for visiting the ED or hospitalization and therefore it is possible that patients who sought emergency care with Covid-19 in our cohort were more severely ill than patients who sought emergency care with influenza in past years. The increased risk of stroke in Covid-19 infection may thus reflect greater severity of underlying illness. Second, our study involved two hospitals and thus our results may not be generalizable to other settings. In particular, we were unable to estimate the population-level incidence of ischemic stroke among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and compare this incidence to the general population.",
