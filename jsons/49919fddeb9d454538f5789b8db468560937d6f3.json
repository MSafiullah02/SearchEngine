            "text": "gene (C9ORF72) was identifi ed as the most common genetic abnormality in familial and sporadic forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the cause in most families where both conditions occur. The associated FTD phenotype is most often the behavioral variant and the motor neuron disease is usually classical ALS; however, a wide range of neurological features are now recognized, including aphasia, memory defi cits, extrapyramidal dysfunction, psychosis and learning disability. The neuropathology of C9ORF72 mutation carriers includes a combination of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 immunoreactive (ir) neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions and neurites (FTLD-TDP) and typical ALS with TDP-43-ir inclusions in motor neurons. The specifi c FTLD-TDP subtype is most often type B. Two additional pathological changes are highly characteristic of cases with the C9ORF72 mutation, each of which may play a pathogenic role. Aggregates of RNA, composed of the massively expanded GGGGCC repeat, can be demonstrated in neuronal nuclei using fl uorescent in situ hybridization. These RNA foci are thought to bind and sequester specifi c RNA binding proteins, leading to the abnormal splicing of other genes. Another absolutely sensitive and specifi c pathological change is the presence of neuronal inclusions in the cerebellar granular layer, hippocampal pyramidal neurons and other neuroanatomical sites, that immunostain for markers of the ubiquitin proteasome system (i.e. ubiquitin and p62) but that are negative for TDP-43. It has recently been shown that these inclusions are composed of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins that result from the unconventional translation of the expanded GGGGCC repeats in both sense and antisense direction and in all reading frames (poly-GA, -GP, -GR and poly-PA, -PG, -PR respectively). Clinicopathological correlative studies have shown that the anatomical distribution of TDP-43 pathology correlates closely with the pattern of neurodegeneration and clinical phenotype. In contrast, the distribution of DPR pathology is highly consistent among cases, with no clinical correlation, suggesting that DPR inclusions may be a useful pathological marker for the presence of the C9ORF72 mutation but are of uncertain pathogenic signifi cance.",

            "text": "The glioblastoma was well known, in the 1860s, to Virchow who appreciated the lesion ' s infi ltrative nature and relation to lower grade astrocytoma in some cases. Other seemingly more discrete types would, presumably, today be considered \"primary.\" It remained until 2008 for a molecular correlation, mutations in IDH1 or IDH2, to become clear. Later, Scherer was instrumental in refi ning the \"secondary\" subtype. Vascular proliferation was recognized and presciently presumed by Scherer to result from vasostimulatory factors released by the tumor. Decades later, Bevacizumab was created to block VEGF, unsuccessfully thus far insofar as overall survival is concerned. Discovery of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes began with the fi rst description of EGFR overexpression in 1984. Gains of chromosome 7 and losses of 10 were recognized at about the same time. The EGFRvIII variant was identifi ed, and clinical attempts to target EGFR abnormalities continue today. Epigenetic infl uences on tumor development became apparent fi rst in the role of MGMT and its interaction with effects alkylating agents. The pervasive infl uence of epigenetic mechanisms is increasingly appreciated. The role of micro RNAs, some of the latter with multiple targets, adds another layer of complexity. A lesion long known to be complex is thus even more so at closer and closer inspection. Glioblastomas now can be divided into subgroups on the basis of genetics, epigenetics, methylation profi les, micro RNAs, etc. Inter-and intratumoral heterogeneity is now well known. Recognition of therapeutic opportunities, and obstacles, continues to evolve.",

            "text": "The generic category of diffuse gliomas (DG) includes two distinct tumor entities: tumors derived from oligodendrocyte precursor cells -OPCs (OligoPDTs) versus those derived from stem cells (SCDTs). Oligo PDTs are IDH-mutated; the tumor cells express the markers of OPCs PDGFR \u03b1 and \u03b2 . This category includes most WHO low-grade DG and comprises two variants: (1) tumors with TP53 mutations; (2) tumors with 1p/19q loss. SCDTs are IDHwt, and contain CD34 + tumor stem-like cells (TSC). This category includes most WHO high-grade DG and includes two variants: (1) malignant glioneuronal tumors (MGNts) that express markers of glial and neuronal lineage; (2) glioblastomas that according to our restricted defi nition (GBrd) express markers of glial lineage exclusively and presence of necrosis is required for the diagnosis. In our series of patients with a retrospective diagnosis of OligoPDT, MGNT and GBrd, the median age was, respectively, 40, 57 and 65 years (p < 0.0001), median overall survival (OS) was 12, 1.3, and 0.5 years (p < 0.0001); OS in OligoPDTs with or without p53 accumulation: 7.7 vs. 18.1 years (p < 0.0001). The behavior of OligoPDTs and SCDTs is similar to that of adult OPCs from which they derive. OligoPDTs initially grow as isolated tumor cells -ITCs (50% of the cases at the time of diagnosis) (i) as astrocytes during development and reactive astrocytes in the injured brain, stromal astrocytes induce microangiogenesis and secrete PDGF, which induces the proliferation of OPCs, and block their differentiation. (ii) In contrast to adult OPCs originating in the cortex, those developing in the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) migrate long distances within the white matter: on MRI, OligoPDTs with a superfi cial localization are typically well circumscribed; those located in the white matter show an infi ltrative pattern and have a worse prognosis (OS: 18.1 vs. 5.4 years), (iii) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is not expressed in the oligodendroglial population of the adult brain and in tumor cells of OligoPDTs suggesting that IDH mutation allows OligoPDTs to overcome the silencing of LDH. SCDTs have an autonomous growth and are highly angiogenic. It has been reported that, as their normal counterpart, TSC generate endothelial cells and that the pluripotency of stem-cells decreases with age: GBrds arise in elderly patients, do not express markers of neuronal lineage and PDGFRnegative GBrds carry a worse prognosis (OS: 5.9 vs. 9.7 months, p = 0.013).",

            "text": "The last decade has seen both an expansion and transformation in our knowledge of the genetic etiologies and the molecular pathologies associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which encompasses a clinically and neuropathologically heterogeneous group of frontotemporal diseases. Increasingly, there is evidence of a genetic, neuropathological and clinical overlap between both FTLD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND). Most frontotemporal diseases are characterized by the pathological aggregation of misfolded proteins, either in neurons or glial cells, or both. Specifi c diagnosis of disease within the broad group of frontotemporal diseases now requires immunohistochemistry to determine the molecular pathology, morphology, and distribution of lesions in the neuraxis, and thereby identify the neurodegenerative disease. About one half of cases with frontotemporal disease are characterized by inclusion bodies containing the transactive response (TAR) DNAbinding protein of 43 kDa (FTLD-TDP) .This molecular pathology is found in sporadic cases of frontotemporal disease as well as those with autosomal dominant FTLD/ALS with C9orf72, GRN, VCP, or TARDBP gene mutations. The neuropathology of these conditions is generally characterized by ubiquitin/p62 and TDP-43-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs), neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs), dystrophic neurites (DNs), and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs), but the distribution and density of lesions may vary between subtypes. Although mutations in the FUS gene are most frequent in familial ALS, three apparently sporadic diseases have distinct FUS proteinopathy (FTLD-FUS): neuronal intermediate fi lament inclusion disease (NIFID), basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD), and atypical FTLD with ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions (aFTLD-U). About one half of cases have abnormal intracellular cytoplasmic accumulations of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau encoded by MAPT. In the adult brain, there are normally six isoforms of tau, three isoforms contain three microtubule-binding repeats (3R tau) and three isoforms contain four microtubule-binding repeats (4R tau). FTLD-tau includes sporadic diseases: pick disease (3R), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) (4R), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (4R), and others, and familial cases caused by mutations in MAPT. Recent developments in the molecular pathology and genetics of FTLD now dictate that a minimal panel of pathological investigations is required for correct diagnosis in this group of diseases. Standardization of nomenclature and approach will facilitate better understanding of clinico-pathologic correlations, provide insights into pathogenesis, and guide the construction and validation of in vivo models. PSP and CBD are major sporadic 4-repeat tauopathies. Tufted astrocytes (TAs) in PSP and astrocytic plaques (APs) in CBD have been regarded as the characteristic pathological hallmarks. To better outline the pathological features of each disease and defi ne the astrocytic inclusions, we reviewed 95 PSP cases and 30 CBD cases. The pathological features of PSP are divided into three representative subtypes: typical PSP type, pallido-nigro-luysian type (PNL type), and CBD-like type. CBD is divided into three pathological subtypes: typical CBD type, basal ganglia-predominant type, and PSP-like type. TAs are found exclusively in PSP, while APs are exclusive to CBD, regardless of the pathological subtypes, although some morphological variations exist, especially with regard to TAs. The overlap of the pathological distribution of PSP and CBD makes their clinical diagnosis complicated, although the presence of TAs and APs differentiate these two diseases. Immunoelectron microscopic examination using quantum dot nanocrystals revealed fi lamentous tau accumulation of APs located in the immediate vicinity of the synaptic structures, which suggested synaptic dysfunction by APs. The characteristics of tau accumulation in both neurons and glia suggest a different underlying mechanism with regard to the sites of tau aggregation and fi bril formation between PSP and CBD: proximal-dominant aggregation of TAs and formation of fi lamentous NFTs in PSP in contrast to the distal-dominant aggregation of APs and formation of less fi lamentous pretangles in CBD. The pathological subtypes of PSP and CBD suggest that the clinical phenotypes are in accordance with the pathological distribution and degenerative changes.",

            "text": "Concepts regarding the pathogenesis of Parkinson ' s disease (PD) have undergone substantial revision over the past decade. The Braak hypothesis has engendered widespread support for a spatiotemporally dynamic model whereby alpha-synuclein (AS) aggregation is initiated not in the substantia nigra, or even the central nervous system, but in the peripheral nervous system from which it \"spreads\" over time to ultimately involve multiple CNS loci. Initial AS aggregation may be induced by some yet-to-be identifi ed environmentally derived toxin or microbial pathogen. This novel model has crucial pathogenetic, diagnostic, and therapeutic implications. The olfactory mucosa and the enteric nervous system (ENS) have been specifi cally implicated as initial sites of AS aggregation. Within the latter, there appears to be a rostrocaudal gradient of decreasing Lewy pathology, suggesting differential vulnerability of distinct levels of the gastrointestinal tract to AS aggregation. Our studies of the topographical distribution of AS in the ENS of neurologically intact humans have revealed that the mucosal plexus of the vermiform appendix is particularly enriched in AS. This, combined with its dense innervation from neurons in the dorsal vagal complex, one of the fi rst CNS sites to be affected by Lewy pathology, render the appendiceal ENS an attractive candidate as a locus for initial AS aggregation. The status of the appendix as an \"immune organ\" has further pathogenetic implications as there is increasing support for a role for immune mechanisms in PD pathophysiology. In this context, a hypothesis regarding a possible role for Epstein-Barr virus-induced autoimmunity in PD pathogenesis will be discussed.",

Tau immunohistochemistry reveals 4R immunoreactive globular oligodendroglial and astrocytic inclusions. The oligodendroglial inclusions are Gallyas positive; however, the atsroglial inclusions are predominantly negative for Gallyas silver staining. The oligodendroglial tau-positive globular inclusions are reminiscent of the alpha-synuclein positive oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions seen in multiple system atrophy. Presence of GGIs associates with a range of clinical presentations, which correlate with the severity and distribution of underlying tau pathology and neurodegeneration. The diverse clinicopathological presentations and GGIs have been described in the literature using various terminologies. A group of neuropathologists formed a consensus on terminology to classify these cases. We agreed that GGIs were present in all the cases reviewed and that the morphology of globular astrocytic inclusions was different to tufted-astrocyte type inclusions. The different morphological subtypes are likely to represent a spectrum of a distinct disease entity. The term globular glial tauopathy (GGT) was proposed. Three major types were distinguished. Type I cases typically present with frontotemporal dementia, type II cases are characterized by pyramidal features refl ecting corticospinal tract degeneration and type III cases can present with a combination of frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease with or without extrapyramidal symptoms. Signifi cant degeneration of the white matter is a feature of all GGT subtypes. Improved detection and classifi cation of GGTs helps future studies on tauopathies.",

            "text": "Central nervous system (CNS) small vessel disease is an arbitrary subdivision that separates those groups of disorders that affect the nervous system from injury to vessels outside the parenchyma of the brain, i.e. large extra cranial vessels that supply the nervous system and intracranial vessels within the subarachnoid space, from those that penetrate the parenchyma of the brain, i.e. typically arterioles, venules and the components of the microcirculation. This operational defi nition serves to distinguish major pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke and corresponding clinical syndromes that differ greatly between the two groups. Three generalizations apply to most forms of CNS small vessel disease -these are disorders that affect multiple vessels throughout the neuraxis; a broad range of abnormalities accompanies the vascular injury, be it infl ammatory, or predominantly non-infl ammatory; the vascular lesions are associated either with focal hemorrhage or thrombosis, with corresponding parenchymal brain injury. In some, the principal clinical manifestations are those of focal neurological defi cits referable to the anatomic region involved, whereas in others, syndromes of dementia (with or without associated degenerative disease), or encephalopathies, predominate. The armamentarium of new radiological imaging methods has enhanced awareness of these important causes of neurological morbidity. Some of these affect predominantly or exclusively the CNS, whereas others are systemic vascular disorders that involve the brain and spinal cord along with other organ systems. For purposes of classifi cation, and conceptually, these are disorders of the \"microcirculation\" and small blood vessels in general. The so-called \"small arteries\" or arterioles include perforators with diameters from 40 to 400 \u03bc m. Some emerge from the leptomeningeal arteries, enter the brain parenchyma from the surface of the brain, and extend within to a variable depth, some reaching the deep white matter as medullary branches. Other perforators enter the brain at the base (supplying the basal ganglia and thalamus), and yet others irrigate the brainstem arising from long and short circumferential branches. For the most part, these are end-arteries with limited collateral anastomoses until the capillary network is reached. The classifi cation below is offered as a framework for the understanding of CNS small vessel disease: A. Systemic diseases with CNS involvement 1. Atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension -lacunar infarction 2. Cerebrovascular complications of hematologic disordershemorrhage/infarction a.

            "text": "Neuropathological data are available only in a few cases of nonamyloid hereditary diseases of CSV and are occasionally diagnostic. CADASIL is the prototype of dominant hereditary diseases of CSV. Since the initial description (Baudrimont et al . Stroke 1993) , its neuropathology has been established by numerous reports. Changes in CSV are diffuse and include specifi c alterations: granular basophilic deposits presenting at e.m. as granular osmiophilic material \"GOM\" and accumulation of the extracellular domain of Notch 3(ECDN3), which can be identifi ed by immmunohistochemistry (Joutel et al ., J Clin Invest 2000) . These diagnostic changes are systemic and can be observed on skin biopsies. Parenchymal brain changes are considered the consequence of ischemia due to vascular stenosis, which is a feature of CADASIL. Subcortical lacunar infarcts and arteriopathic leukoencephalopathy are characteristics of the disease and included in the eponym. Frequent, less classical changes: status cribrosus and involvement of the cerebral cortex, which may result from different mechanisms, will also be discussed. In the other dominant hereditary diseases of CSV, neuropathological data are rare and less specifi c. Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy is characterized by involvement of SV of the brain and retina. Distinctive multilaminated vascular basement membranes in systemic organs have been found at e.m. However, neuropathological studies are few and non-specifi c. COL 4A1 and COL 4A2 mutations cause systemic small vessel disease. Involvement of the vascular basal membrane in systemic organs has been shown at e.m. but neuropathological study has only been performed in fetuses. It showed cavitary necrotic lesion (porencephaly) and old and recent hemorrhages with abnormalities of small vessel walls. Idiopathic basal ganglia calcifi cation or Fahr disease is a common incidental neuroimaging or post mortem fi nding. In some cases, it has been linked to mutations in PDGFRB and in PDGFB and experimental studies suggest that the calcium deposition depends on the loss of endothelial PDGF-B and correlates with the degree of pericyte and blood-brain barrier defi ciency. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) defi ciency is a rare primary immunodefi ciency referred to as an autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome. Recently, vascular abnormalities in heart and brains have been described radiologically. Postmortem examination of a patient who died from ruptured basilar artery aneurysm also showed vascular leukoencephalopathy and abnormalities of CSV likely to result from connective tissue disease. In a single case of hereditary extensive vascular leukoencephalopathy (HEVL) mapping to chromosome 20q13, neuropathological study showed very specifi c changes of small terminal arterioles and vasa vasorum, more severe in the cortico-subcortical areas, basal ganglia, and subependymal regions. In Swedish hereditary multi-infarct dementia as in pontine autosomal dominant microangiopathy and leukoencephalopathy (PADMAL), the gene mutation has not been identifi ed. Neuropathological changes are comparable and include multiple lacunar infarcts with severe involvement of the pons. CSV changes include concentric intimal proliferation with hyperelastosis and atrophy of the tunica media in the absence of GOM or ECDN3 deposits. Recessive hereditary diseases of CSV include CARASIL in which the gene mutation has been identifi ed and neuropathological studies have revealed variable, usually non-specifi c, changes of CSV, and leukoencephalopathy, cerebral calcifi cations and cysts (LCC) the responsible gene mutation of which is not identifi ed but the hereditary character of which is likely given its very suggestive pathology and a notion of consanguinity in some families. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) (family Picornaviridae, genus Human Enterovirus A) belongs to a large group of enteroviruses that also includes the poliovirus. It usually causes mild paediatric hand, foot and mouth disease, manifesting as skin rashes or vesicles in these classical sites. More rarely, complications such as meningitis, acute fl accid paralysis, transverse myelitis and encephalomyelitis may occur. Huge outbreaks of EV71 infection with signifi cant central nervous system (CNS) complications in the Asia-Pacifi c region and beyond have become major public health concerns since anti-viral drugs and vaccines are not yet available. Autopsy studies of fatal encephalomyelitis showed a stereotyped topographic distribution of infl ammation, viral infection and destruction of neurons mainly in the spinal cord, brainstem, hypothalamus and cerebellar dentate nucleus with minimal infl ammation in the cerebral hemisphere, including the motor area. Entry into the CNS is believed to be via a retrograde peripheral motor nerve route while spread within the CNS may involve other neuronal pathways. Recent evidence suggests that viral replication could occur in the tonsillar crypt epithelium, thus facilitating oral and faecal viral shedding. The tonsil may also be a portal for viral entry into the body. Presumably this is followed by viral replication in other extra-CNS sites (e.g. skin) and/or viraemia, leading to neuroinvasion in susceptible patients. A hypothesis for EV71 transmission in the CNS will be discussed and compared with poliovirus and Japanese encephalitis virus. The role of the Scavenger Receptor B2 receptor in EV71 neurotropism will be reviewed.",

Most of these infections potentially affect the nervous system and thus are of relevance for neuropathology. However, even hitherto well-known viruses may change their host spectrum, adapt to changed environments, or change their tropism, leading to new and unrecognized diseases or therapy-related complications. One paramount example is the JC polyomavirus (JCV), the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) known since 1971. Despite high seroprevalence, JCV has been pathogenic only in immune compromised conditions including AIDS. More recently, PML has emerged as rare but important complication of MS therapy with monoclonal antibodies like natalizumab or rituximab. Moreover, effi cient therapy of the underlying immune defi ciency, e.g. by HAART in AIDS, may result in the immune reconstitution infl ammatory syndrome (IRIS) that converts PML into a fulminant infl ammatory disease. Finally, the spectrum of JCV tropism has expanded to meninges, cortical neurons and cerebellar granule cells, giving rise to new diseases of JCV meningitis/encephalopathy or JCV granule cell neuronopathy (JCV-GCN). The neuropathological and immune basis of the fi rst case of JCV-GCN after natalizumab treatment, complicated by IRIS, is discussed.",

Previous studies in human failed to identify differences between the two clinical forms, and this could be due to the methodology and/ or examination late in the disease course. To observe early changes, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique was used to assess blood brain barrier (BBB) (mean diffusivity, MD) and tract integrity (fractional anisotropy, FA) of rabid dogs. Preserved BBB was noted in both clinical forms, whereas cytotoxic edema was more pronounced in the paralytic rabies. Impaired FA (disrupted neural tract integrity) was found at the brainstem of paralytic dogs. At postmortem, more rabies viral antigen was detected in the furious as compared to paralytic rabies in many of the central nervous system regions. Caudal-rostral polarity of rabies viral antigen as observed in both clinical forms, in order from greatest to least: spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, midline structures, hippocampus, and cerebrum. Viral RNA level was signifi cantly higher in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem of dogs with the furious sign. Of particular interest, a striking infl ammatory response was detected in the brainstem of paralytic rabies, and this fi nding correlated well with the altered neural tract integrity and presence of interleukin-1 \u03b2 and interferon-\u03b3 mRNAs. Disruption of axoplasmic fl ow by infl ammation in the brainstem could potentially retard viral propagation toward the cerebral hemispheres in the case of paralytic rabies, and explain the longer survival period as compared to the furious counterpart.",

Historically, many of these emergent infections were the result of disruption of biosphere equilibriums with introduction of new pathogens into previously unexposed populations. For unknown reasons, infection of the brain has suffered a disproportionate share of these diseases. In addition to ecological disruptions, man has chosen to deliberately manipulate pathogens to achieve lethal destruction of his fellow man. These bioterrorism efforts have led to introduction of well-characterized agents through novel routes (e.g. aerosol dispersion) circumventing normally protective immunological responses. To protect himself from infectious agents, man has also attempted to created vaccines to obviate severe disease associated with initial exposure. While on the whole, these vaccines have been highly successful means of conferring protective immunity, they do not provide as robust an immune protection as a natural infection. Unfortunately, protection from lethal systemic disease has not been universally associated with protection from lethal encephalitis. Finally, the sheer size of the human population and its associated biome have resulted in the emergence of virulent pathogenic strains from ubiquitous less pathogenic organisms. Again, for unclear reasons, many of these new pathogens exact a profound toll on the human brain. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a fatal disease of the CNS, result of the opportunistic infection by the human neurotropic JC virus (JCV), and frequently seen in immunocompromised patients. PML is characterized by extensive demyelination of the subcortical white matter caused by the lytic destruction of oligodendrocytes. There is no effective treatment for PML and the median survival rarely surpasses 6 months. A growing concern is the development of PML as side effect of immunomodulatory therapy in the treatment of numerous autoimmune diseases. MicroRNAs are small ( \u223c 22 nucleotides), non-coding RNA molecules that are present in the genomes of almost every organism and infl uence biological processes by regulating expression of their target gene(s). It is predicted that approximately 50% of all genes are regulated by microRNAs making them important regulators of most physiological processes, including apoptosis, differentiation, and immune regulation; as well as many pathophysiological processes such as infl ammatory disease, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Preliminary data of the fi rst high-throughput microRNA profi le of PML revealed 54 microRNAs up-regulated and 17 microRNAs downregulated by a greater than 2-fold difference. Target gene and gene ontology (GO) analysis suggests that among the pathways targeted by these microRNAs, there in an enrichment in pathways involved in regulation of apoptosis, nucleotide metabolism, NF-\u03ba B signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. We corroborated the up-regulation of MCDC2, an apoptotic regulator. In addition, we have found two virally generated microRNAs, encoded in the c-terminal of the large T-Antigen gene, which provide JCV with innate immune evasion capabilities and help its replication cycle.",

Usually, NB concerns mostly either the sural or the superfi cial peroneal nerve, which is combined with removal of specimens from the peroneus brevis muscle. The diagnosis of vasculitic lesions can be readily established on nerve paraffi n-embedded fragments, although in some cases, characteristic lesions are only visible on muscle specimens.

In these dysimmune neuropathies, treatments according to the mechanisms of lesions of the nerve parenchyma are quite effi cient. With respect to genetic PN, more than 60 genes may be involved; if the most frequent gene mutations have not been detected, detailed pathological analysis of the nerve can orient the search for mutations in specifi c genes.

Different techniques for tissue processing and nerve fi ber evaluation have been employed and validated. The quantifi cation of intraepidermal innervation can be useful to detect a pathological correlate for otherwise unexplained burning pain in the toes or feet, i.e. small fi ber neuropathy. Normative values for different body areas have been established. For diagnostic purposes in peripheral neuropathies, one biopsy is performed at the distal leg (10 cm above the lateral malleolus) and a further one at the proximal thigh (20 cm below the iliac spine) in order to gain information on whether the disease is length dependent. Using appropriate immunohistochemical stains, different nerve fi ber populations can be investigated in the skin. Quantifi cation of pilomotor and sudomotor nerves gives information on autonomic nervous system involvement in peripheral neuropathy. Recently, the possibility to sample myelinated fi bers and mechanoreceptors, particularly in glabrous skin has extended the application of skin biopsy to questions of myelin pathology. In particular, the new area of nodo-paranodopathies may benefi t from analysis of Ranvier nodes in dermal nerve fi bers. Immunostaining for infl ammatory cells may help in the diagnosis of vasculitic neuropathy.

In past decades, various attempts have been made to classify specifi c neuropathology patterns of hippocampal neuronal cell loss and correlate subtypes with postsurgical outcome. A task force from the Diagnostic Methods Commission of the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) reviewed previous classifi cation schemes and proposed a system based on semi-quantitative hippocampal cell loss patterns that can be applied in any histopathology laboratory. Inter-and intra observer agreement studies reached consensus to classify three types in anatomically well preserved hippocampal specimens (HS ILAE Type I, II or III; details will be presented). Surgical hippocampus specimens obtained from TLE patients may also show normal content of neurons with reactive gliosis only (no-HS). This fi rst international consensus classifi cation will aid in the characterization of specifi c clinico-pathological syndromes, explore variability in imaging and electrophysiology fi ndings, and postsurgical seizure control. It is debatable whether developmental tumours (DT) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) are part of a neuropathological continuum or represent distinct entities. Because surrounding cortical dyslamination is so frequently associated with DT, this debate impacts upon presurgical evaluation and surgical treatment of refractory partial epilepsies due to DT. The new ILAE classifi cation of FCD recently fuelled this controversy by creating a category in which cortical dyslamination (i.e. FCD type I) is associated with DT, comprising the 'new' category FCD type III. For this to be clinically meaningful, it is important to decide on the epileptogenic relevance of the dysplastic abnormalities (i.e. dyslamination) associated with the DT. More specifi cally, it is important to determine whether dyslaminated cortex surrounding a DT can generate seizures on its own, or whether it is of low epileptogenic relevance -and seizures are solely dependent on the DT. The problem is compounded by the fact that intermingled with the dyslamination there are often satellites of the tumour and it is unclear whether persisting seizures following lesionectomies are due to remaining 'dysplasia (i.e. dyslamination)' or subtotal resection of the tumour (i.e. persistence of satellites). We will present a tailored approach to epilepsy-related DT, abandoning the simplistic view that all patients should be evaluated with intracranial EEG electrodes, on the rationale that the seizure onset zone is otherwise uncertain. Taking into consideration clinical, scalp EEG and imaging features, we will report the Porto Alegre series of epilepsy-related DT operated under acute ECoG guidance.

Therefore, prevention of epileptogenesis after a primary brain insult could be an inventive method to reduce pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Here, we will address the current knowledge on the underlying mechanisms involved in epileptogenesis, and on the potential novel treatments that may lead to prevention of intractable epilepsy. So far, all clinical and the vast majority of experimental studies have fail to truly prevent (cure) epilepsy after a brain injury. Nevertheless, some experimental studies have shown that prophylactic treatment with different compounds may lead to diminished brain damage, reduction of frequency and severity of spontaneous seizures and reduction of behavioral and cognitive defi cits.

Epilepsy surgery resections for lesions resulting from perinatal ischemic injury range from small cortical and larger lobar resections to hemispherectomies, and the principal abnormalities found in these specimens consist of porencephaly with microgyri and ulegyria. The latter two are also seen as isolated lesions. The adjacent cortex may be thin and attenuated with disorganized architecture and absence of lamination, or represented by nodules of gray matter. The cortex may appear thick and marbled, with aberrant myelinated axons running vertically up between groups of neurons. In some cases, cortical lamination is maintained, but neurons are reduced in number. Focal microcolumnar arrangement of neurons is often found in cortex adjacent to the main lesion. Hypertrophic neurons are frequently found in the microgyri and the surviving crowns of ulegyria and may be found in the better preserved cortex further away.

Indeed, VEGF inhibition resulted in potent anti-tumor effects in different glioma xenograft models. Such fi ndings have led to clinical trials in glioblastoma patients with different anti-angiogenic agents. Follow-up scans of glioma patients that were treated with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab often revealed reduced vasogenic brain edema and reduced contrast enhancement of the neoplasms. Unfortunately, two recently published large, prospective and randomized trials (AVAGLIO, RTOG) did not show benefi t for overall survival for patients who received bevacizumab as part of their treatment for primary glioblastoma. To those familiar with the histology of glioblastomas this may not come as a surprise. First of all, the effi cacy of anti-angiogenic treatment may be limited because of the diffuse infi ltrative character of this neoplasm with many tumor vessels being incorporated rather than newly formed. Furthermore, in areas that do show a prominent angiogenic response the contribution of the (often markedly abnormal!) microvasculature to the perfusion of the tumor tissue may be limited and for sure was not able to prevent necrosis to occur.

Angiogenesis in GB, like all solid tumors, is mediated primarily by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is also an important vascular permeability factor, and is therefore the primary culprit behind vascular cerebral edema, a major cause of morbidity in brain tumor patients. Bevacizumab (BV), an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, became the fi rst clinically validated antiangiogenic therapy for recurrent GB. BV demonstrated signifi cant clinical activity in non-comparative phase II studies used as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Clinical activity was mostly based on reduced need for steroids, impressive radiological responses and promising survival rates.BV introduction into clinical practice brought some challenges, like how to evaluate tumor response, and a wide spectrum of toxicities, such as hypertension, thromboembolism, and especially delayed wound healing and bleeding. Currently, the clinical benefi t of adding BV to fi rst-line standard therapy is being discussed with the publication of two phase III clinical trials, showing a lack of overall survival benefi t and some contrasting results regarding quality of life, despite an improvement in progression-free survival. Finally, despite some advances, many signifi cant treatment challenges remain. There is an urgent need to validate predictive biomarkers for patient selection and monitoring the effi cacy of brain pathology anti-VEGF treatment.

This is problematic in diseases, such as Alzheimer ' s, Parkinson ' s or schizophrenia, where patients have been treated under the broad hypothesis that anti-infl ammatory medication should be of benefi t. We have asked the question whether an unbiased, data-driven in silico approach may help to clarify the confusion. Specifi cally, we have examined whether unsupervised clustering of microarray data obtained from cerebral cortex of Alzheimer ' s, Parkinson ' s and schizophrenia patients would reveal a degree of relatedness between these diseases and recognized infl ammatory conditions. Our results provide strong evidence against this hypothesis demonstrating that distinct sets of genes are involved: key characteristics of the infl ammatory response are recognizable across different organs at the histophenotypic and the transcriptomic level but are not shared with 'neuroinfl ammation' (1). Similarly, work using a newly created knockout mouse (Banati et al ., submitted) indicates that expression of binding sites for a mitochondrial microglial regulator, which is commonly ascribed to activated microglia, can be functionally dissociated from classical microglial activation, calling concepts into question that link activated microglia to non-autoimmune 'neuroinfl ammation'. It seems particularly important to determine whether microglial activation in the numerous conditions where it is seen (from sleep deprivation to depression and obesity) relates to synaptic changes and whether the bi-functionality of complement (infl ammatory role in infl ammation and synaptic role in healthy and \u00a9 2014 The Authors.

Some conditions displaying fl orid lymphohistiocytic infi ltrates pose significant diagnostic pitfalls due to the rarity of their initial or sole presentation in or around the central nervous system (CNS). Such happens with Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), and Whipple disease (WD), whose unsuspected diagnoses may be the neuropathologist ' s prerogative to unravel. Intracranial RDD is a deft clinical mimicker of meningioma and may histologically resemble the lymphoplasmacyte-rich type. Emperipolesis (engulfment of intact lymphocytes by histiocytes) is often diffi cult to fi nd and typical RDD patterns are commonly obliterated by dense dural fi brosis. CD68 and S100 positivity favors RDD, whereas CD1a negativity excludes Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). ECD, another skillful mimicker of meningioma, is easily overlooked when the characteristic long bone lesions are clinically silent. ECD diagnosis is based on systemic fi ndings and exclusion of RDD and LCH (ECD histiocytes are CD68positive but S100-negative and CD1a-negative). CNS WD usually manifests itself as lymphocytic encephalitis with numerous PAS-positive histiocytes, the diagnosis being confi rmed by PCR or immunohistochemical demonstration of Tropheryma whipplei . Histiocytes are also a prominent feature of LCH (which shows CD68-negative, S100positive, CD1a-positive dendritic cells), choroid plexus xanthogranuloma (mostly an incidental autopsy fi nding), and the extremely rare juvenile xanthogranuloma and histiocytic sarcoma. On the other hand, histiocytes are often encountered in the setting of infection, demyelination, infarction, and various tumor types, where they may facilitate or hinder the diagnosis depending on the observer ' s awareness. The diagnosis of PCNSL may be a challenging one in several settings including inadequate sampling of the lesions and, most commonly, effects of corticosteroid treatment prior the brain biopsies.

Seizures secondary to rapidly growing tumors are usually well controlled by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and, therefore, do not require attention by epileptologists. Patients with increased intracranial pressure, or progressive focal neurological signs, are readily referred for brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which will identify the tumor. Most centers will then move forward to neurosurgical resection with a neuro-oncologic approach. By contrast, patients with low-grade glial and glio-neuronal tumors defi ned as long-term epilepsy-associated brain tumors (LEATs) usually have seizures as the sole manifestation, with onset during early life often refractory to AEDs. LEATs are more common in the mesial temporal lobe and may not be detected by CT. Although MRI is highly sensitive, some LEATs may be missed due to small size and frequent non-enhancement with gadolinium. Therefore, MRI should include thin coronal T1weigheted and fl uid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images to avoid false-negatives. One challenge is when to indicate surgery in LEAT patients with well-controlled seizures. By contrast, LEAT patients with non-controlled seizures have a clear indication of early surgery. Studies have shown better seizure outcome for LEAT patients undergoing tailored resection, including the surrounding epileptogenic tissue, rather than simple lesionectomy. Patients with epilepsy secondary to diffuse gliomas are also challenging because these lesions are highly epileptogenic and frequently cannot be completely resected, leading to frequent refractory seizures that signifi cantly impacts quality of life.",

Our recent work is focused on the identifi cation and validation of additional molecular interactions of PrP C , as well as on structural evidence for allosteric function of PrP C . A phage display screen, together with evidence from PrP C -null mice, implicates several neurotransmitter receptors and/or transporters in PrP C -dependent signaling. Several of these putative ligands have been functionally validated. In turn, biophysical techniques showed that interaction of PrP C with its ligand hop/STI1 entails reciprocal structural remodeling, and strongly suggest allosteric effects that may be involved in the propagation of signals through PrP C -mediated multiprotein complexes. Our current in silico studies corroborates this hypothesis. In addition, we tested functional properties and dysfunction of PrP C beyond the nervous system, and found that both peripheral infl ammation and behavioral stress modulate the content of PrP C at the plasma membrane of neutrophils, with consequences upon peroxide-dependent cytotoxicity toward vascular endothelial cells. Our data are consistent with the scaffold hypothesis, which explains the multiple roles of the prion protein in physiology and pathology, and further suggest that PrP C may be relevant for various degenerative/noncommunicable diseases.

The physiological relevance of these STI1 activities in vivo is unknown. The absence of STI1 is embryonic lethal by E10.5 with mutant mice showing increased caspase-3 activation, 50% impairment in cellular proliferation, placental disruption and lack of cellular viability. STI1 haploinsuffi cient mice showed increased vulnerability to ischemic insult. Extracellular STI1 prevented ischemiamediated neuronal death in a PrP-dependent way. In addition, specifi c binding of A \u03b2 Os (A \u03b2 oligomers) to PrP is effi ciently inhibited by STI. Treatment with STI1 prevented A \u03b2 O-induced synaptic loss and neuronal death in cultured neurons and long-term potentiation inhibition in mouse hippocampal slices. Interestingly, STI1-haploinsuffi cient neurons were more sensitive to A \u03b2 O-induced cell death and could be rescued by treatment with recombinant STI1. Thus, indicating the essential roles for intracellular and extracellular STI1 in cellular resilience. STI1 is released by astrocytes; however, it lacks a signal peptide and does not follow a classical secretion mechanism. Diverse biochemical and electronic microscopy approaches demonstrated its secretion by exosome-like vesicles. STI1 partially co-localized with Rab5 and Rab7 in endosomal compartments, and a dominant-negative for vacuolar protein sorting 4A (VPS4A), required for formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), impaired EV and STI1 release. Flow cytometry and PK digestion demonstrated that STI1 localized to the outer leafl et of EVs, and its association with EVs greatly increased STI1 activity upon PrP-dependent neuronal signaling.

We previously demonstrated that the injection of brain extracts from human mutant P301S tau-expressing transgenic mice into the brains of mice transgenic for wild-type human tau (ALZ17) resulted in the assembly of wild-type human tau into fi laments and the spreading of tau inclusions from the injection sites to anatomically connected brain regions. This is consistent with an intercellular transfer of tau aggregates. We have then injected brain extracts from humans with pathologically confi rmed AD, TD, PiD, AGD, PSP and CBD into the brains of ALZ17 mice. Silver-positive inclusions formed in all cases, with the presence of pathological structures reminiscent of AGD, PSP and CBD following the injection of the corresponding human brain extracts. The assembly and spreading of human tau in the ALZ17 brain was independent of A \u03b2 . Similar inclusions also formed after intracerebral injection of brain homogenates from human tauopathies into non-transgenic mice, and the induced formation of tau aggregates could be propagated between mouse brains. Finally, we have shown that the intraperitoneal injection of brain extracts from symptomatic mice transgenic for human mutant P301S tau into presymptomatic transgenic mice promoted the formation of tau inclusions in brain, albeit less effi ciently than following intracerebral injection.

Genotype-phenotype correlation through the analysis of the effect of different mutations on protein expression and on phenotypic variability contributes to the understanding of gene function.

These diseases are associated to an unconventional agent, named prion, that seems to be composed exclusively by a misfolded form of the prion protein (PrP Sc ), which propagates by transmitting its misfolding to the normal prion protein (PrP C ). The lack of a procedure to cultivate prions in the laboratory has been a major limitation to the study of the unorthodox nature of this infectious agent and the molecular mechanism by which PrP C is converted into the infectious PrP Sc isoform. Protein misfolding cyclic amplifi cation (PMCA) is a simple, fast and effi cient methodology to mimic prion replication in the test tube. PMCA consists of incubating materials containing minute amounts of infectious prions with an excess of PrP C and boosting the conversion by cycles of sonication to fragment the converting units, leading to accelerated prion replication. PMCA is able to detect the equivalent of one single molecule of infectious PrP Sc and propagate prions that maintain high infectivity, strain properties and species specifi city. Since its invention 13 years ago, PMCA has helped to answer fundamental questions of this intriguing infectious agent and has broad applications in research areas including the food industry, blood bank safety and human and veterinary disease diagnosis.",

Among gliomas, those of low grade represent the most frequent primary brain tumors in children. Pathologically, they correspond to World Health Organization (WHO) grades I or II and include pilocytic astrocytoma, pilomyxoid astrocytoma variant, angiocentric glioma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, diffuse astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. Activating BRAF mutations/rearrangements and increased MAPK pathway signaling are universal features of circumscribed gliomas, such as pilocytic astrocytoma. Although all glioma subtypes may develop in children and adults, clinical and molecular differences have become evident particularly in the diffuse glioma group. Alterations in FGFR1, MYB and MYBL1 are frequent events in pediatric low grade diffuse gliomas while mutations in chromatin remodeling proteins (e.g. ATRX) or histone proteins (H3.3) characterize diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and subsets of pediatric glioblastomas. The embryonal neoplasm category is represented predominantly by medulloblastoma, which has been classifi ed into four main molecular subtypes: WNT, SHH, group 3 and group 4. Similar molecularly based classifi cation schemes have been proposed for primitive neuroectodermal tumors and ependymomas.

Despite a demand for retraction of this paper by members of the NFL Mild Traumatic Brain Injury committee, the paper stood and the second case of CTE in an NFL player was reported shortly afterwards. Since that time, over 100 cases of CTE in the modern era have been evaluated from American football, f\u00fatball, ice hockey, entertainment wrestlers, battered spouses, and American military veterans as well as boxers. At this time, any condition in which a person is subjected to repeated head trauma should be considered as a potential risk factor for the development of this condition. Currently, the epidemiology of CTE is unclear, and the incidence and prevalence of this disorder are unknown. Clinical histories of head trauma and participation in contact sports should be documented for all patients presenting with cognitive or motor symptoms suggestive of a neurodegenerative process. We are at the early stages of understanding this condition: unraveling the clinical-pathological correlations and the pathophysiology will likely take decades and can only be accomplished by cooperation between neuropathologists, neurologists, major sports organizations and military medical facilities. Recent studies corroborate and expand previous reports associating sport-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) to a higher risk of progressing neurodegenerative changes. In fact, the neuropathological features underlying sport-related TBI seems to constitute an independent pathological entity characterized mainly by deposits of phospho-tau proteins with contribution of other abnormal protein inclusions. Soccer is an extremely popular sport worldwide. Well-executed headings are considered one of the most beautiful parts of a soccer game. Headings require critical skill and exhaustive practice that can lead to chronic TBI. However, very few reports approached the underlying neuropathological changes in soccer players. Here we report an 82-year-old former professional soccer player who developed dementia during his last decade of life. His cognitive decline was wellcharacterized for several years and resembled Alzheimer ' s dementia. Neuropathological assessment disclosed moderate Alzheimer ' s disease stages. In addition, chronic traumatic encephalopathy changes characterized by superfi cial cortical phospho-tau deposition in glia and neurons alike, more concentrated in the gyral depths were identifi ed especially in frontotemporal areas. Finally, hippocampal sclerosis and abnormal TDP-43 deposition in temporal and ventral frontal cortical and subcortical structures complete the report. The features of this case resemble those described for other sport-related TBI and further investigation are necessary to clarify to which extend soccer practice can lead to chronic TBI.",

The severity of brain injuries basically depends on the velocity and shape of the projectile.

The main objective of this presentation is to show different characteristics of gunshot wounds and mechanisms of brain injury produced by projectiles of low and high velocity in forensic autopsies. . CTE has been reported most often in athletes, although early changes of CTE were found in fi ve young veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan confl ict who were exposed to explosive blast, four of whom were also diagnosed with posttrau-matic stress disorder. Advanced CTE has also been found in veterans who experienced repetitive neurotrauma while in service, although in general, the pathology tends to be more variable than that found in individuals with exposure to trauma exclusively from sports. Clinically, CTE is associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, memory loss and cognitive impairments that begin insidiously and progress slowly over decades. Pathologically, CTE produces atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, thalamus and hypothalamus, septal abnormalities, and abnormal deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau as neurofi brillary tangles and disordered neurites throughout the brain.

Some studies suggest that even Alzheimer ' s disease might be considered as a disorder of aberrant neural development with pathological changes that are set up at early stages of development. Thus, evaluating proteins and pathways that are important in age-related neurodegeneration in the developing brain together with the characterization of mechanisms important during brain development with relevance to brain ageing are of crucial importance. In particular, aspects of neurogenesis with relevance to ageing, neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins/pathways in the developing brain, and pathways of the developing or neurodegenerating brains that show commonalities need to be characterized. Elucidation of complex pathogenetic routes characterizing the earliest stage of the detrimental processes that result in pathological ageing represents an essential fi rst step toward a therapeutic intervention, which could be able to reverse these pathological processes and prevent the onset of the disease. These concepts suggest that prevention of neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly might begin during the fetal and childhood life.",

This is mainly manifested by activation of microglia and by abnormal brain expression of cytokines and mediators of the immune response. However, parallel studies in several neurodegenerative diseases and related animal models show that the infl ammatory responses differ from one disease to another, with the progression of a given disease and among different brain regions in a particular stage of the disease. Moreover, advanced stages of diseases show a plethora of mixed responses including up-regulation of pro-and anti-infl ammatory cytokines and factors that modulate degeneration and regeneration pathways. Neuroinfl ammation in neurodegenerative diseases differs from neuroinfl ammation related to aging and it is not a mere acceleration of it. Finally, neuroinfl ammatory responses in animal models, although similar, are not exactly the same as those seen in human diseases, thus compromising a direct translation of neuroinfl ammatory responses in animal models, mainly murine transgenic models, to human patients. Together, these observations may explain, at least in part, why current anti-infl ammatory therapies do not work in established stages of human neurodegenerative disease although they are benefi cial in rodent models. These observations also point to the need to identify tailored therapies geared to modulating (activating or inhibiting) specifi c molecules involved in neuroinfl ammation at the early stages of the neurodegenerative processes, ideally before the appearance of clinical symptoms.",

However, this paradox discovered by Nobel laureate Roger Sperry in 1968, remained unsolved since then. We tackled the hypothesis that alternative neural pathways could explain this intriguing clinical presentation, and investigated patients with callosal dysgenesis using structural and functional neuroimaging, and neuropsychological assessments. Two anomalous white matter tracts were identifi ed by deterministic and probabilistic tractography, and proved functional by resting state functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological evidence, playing a functional role in preserved interhemispheric transfer of complex tactile information such as object recognition. These compensatory pathways connect the homotopic posterior parietal cortical areas (Brodmann areas 39 and surroundings) via the posterior and anterior commissures. Other aberrant tracts were found connecting homo-and heterotopic cortical regions, of unknown function. We propose that anomalous brain circuitry in callosal dysgenesis is determined by long-distance plasticity, a phenomenon occurring in the developing brain after pathological interference. As possibly occurs in other developmental brain anomalies, these pathological changes somehow divert growing axons away from their normal pathways, with partial compensatory effects or deleterious consequences to the patients. Long-distance plasticity, therefore, should be conceived as a major property of the developing human brain subjected to pathological circumstances, causing extensive rewiring either capable of compensating loss of function, or of generating symptoms. The fi ndings show that, together with the search for a human brain connectome, it will be important to investigate the dysconnectome of subjects with congenital brain diseases.

In 1986, it was shown that neurofi brillary tangles in Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) contain tau protein. Since then, brain tissue obtained at autopsy or during surgery has been frequently assessed for occurrence of pathologically altered tau protein. Today, we know that in certain pathological conditions, altered tau protein tends to accumulate in nerve cells and glia. There are several primary tauopathies such as Pick ' s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration among others but the commonest disorder displaying tau pathology is AD. Since the beginning of 1990, we know that in AD, the pathological altered tau seems to fi rst appear in the transentorhinal cortex and then spread to neocortex, i.e. neurodegeneration seem to spread in certain manner from one neuroanatomical region to another. Noteworthy, AD-related lesions are seen in unimpaired aged subjects and the primary difference between an aged subject and a subjects suffering from dementia seems to be the level of spread. In line with the spread of AD pathology in humans, in 2009, it was shown that in transgenic animals, altered human tau spread from one site to neighboring brain region and thus a prion-like propagation pattern was suggested. Finally in 2011, it was published that pathological tau is seen in lower brainstem prior to transentorhinal cortex already at the age of 10 years. Thus, hyperphosporylation of tau seems to be an early phenomenon that affects most of us in more or less deleterious manner.",

A subset of AD does not fi t Braak staging, and many AD cases have mixed pathology, most notably concurrent \u03b1 -synuclein or TDP-43 pathology. Tau pathology in AD disseminates from medial temporal lobe to association and fi nally primary cortices. The most severe tau pathology is in medial temporal lobe structures, including hippocampus and amygdala. About 10% of AD has severe cortical tau pathology with minimal involvement of hippocampus (\"hippocampal-sparing AD\") and about 10% have severe tau pathology in medial temporal lobe with minimal cortical involvement (\"limbic predominant AD\"). These AD variants differ from typical AD in demographic features, clinical presentations, and genetic risk profi le. It is increasingly recognized that more than 50% of AD have \u03b1 -synuclein pathology (Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites) and that the distribution of this pathology is different from that seen in Parkinson ' s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.

Static imaging teleneuropathology can be performed online by transmitting interactive still images for diagnostic purpose, or offl ine in a store and forward modus. Technologically improved systems of dynamic imaging teleneuropathology can again be divided in dynamic-robotic and dynamic-virtual approaches.

One could, therefore, say that most glioma research has been and is not very useful because it ignores this particular challenge. Thus, there is a need for new ideas and experimental approaches. It is our goal to develop a new treatment for glioblastoma using genetically enhanced microglia precursors obtained from bone marrow.

This protocol is, nevertheless, ineffective since there is recurrence of the tumor followed by an inevitable fatal outcome. CD47 is a cell surface protein that imparts a signal to the macrophages to \"don ' t eat\" the CD47-positive cells, thus protecting these cells from macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. We demonstrate that CD47 is expressed on all analyzed brain tumors and that the blockade of CD47-induced protection with monoclonal antibodies against CD47 (anti-CD47) stimulates potent tumor phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo . Prazosin, an \u03b1 -adrenergic receptor antagonist, is a clinically approved drug, and has been adopted in daily clinical practice to treat hypertension. We have found that Prazosin selectively eliminates GBM stem cells in vitro and in vivo , by PKC \u03b4 -dependent caspase-3activation, without altering neural stem cells survival, and increases \"eat\" signals, such as phosphatidylserine and calreticulin, in GBM stem cells plasma membrane. This combination therapy induces macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of GBM stem cells in vitro and eliminates the tumor in 50% of the mice, avoiding the recurrence of the tumor in the long term. This therapy can, therefore, be more effective than the current standard protocol for GBM patients.",

Neuroinfl ammation is secondary to endothelial activation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction with the passage of neurotoxic mediators and astrocyte dysfunction and microglial activation. Microcirculatory dysfunction -also secondary to endothelia activation -contributes to the ischemic process, along with systemic circulatory impairment. This brain dysfunction is associated with increased mortality and morbidity but also long-term cognitive disability that can affect up to 70% of survivors at one year. This supports a relationship between neuroinfl ammation and neurodegeneration, although cognitive results might result from the ischemic process. Occurrence of encephalopathy in a septic patient implies a systematic diagnostic approach of all potential factors, additionally to sepsis that contributes to the brain dysfunction, including drugs toxicity or withdrawal, liver/ renal failure, metabolic disturbances, alcohol withdrawal or even a vitamin defi ciency encephalopathy. Neurological examination is indispensable for appropriately undertaking specifi c investigations, such as electrophysiological testing, neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fl uid analysis (that is indisputably required when meningitis is suspected). Alcohol withdrawal delirium or Wernicke ' s encephalopathy are the main differential diagnosis. Currently, SIBD treatment consists mainly on controlling sepsis.

Cognitive impairments are frequently detected in children surviving cerebral malaria (CM). We evaluated mechanisms of cognitive impairment after experimental CM induced by Plasmodium berghei Anka (PbA) infection. We found an intense infl ammatory response in the mouse brain that coincides with the clinical signs of CM and is characterized by increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 , IL-1, MCP-1 and IL-12. Intravital microscopy of the brain microcirculation revealed leukocytes and PRBC adherent to microvessels. We detected an increase in oxidative stress in the brains of CM animals with enhanced malondialdehyde and decreased amounts of free thiols. We have also observed activation of microglia detected by increased immunoreactivity for Iba-1 on hippocampal CA1, dentate gyrus and cortex regions of PbA-infected mice. Infected mice also presented positive fl uorescence to Fluoro Jade B (neuronal degeneration marker) on day 7 post-infection. Also, mRNA levels for nNOS and NMDAr1 and levels of cleaved caspase-3 are enhanced during experimental CM while synaptophysin is reduced on infected mice. Mice rescued from the infection by chloroquine treatment were tested for cognitive function on day 16 post-infection. Animals recovered from infection presented cognitive decline for both aversive and contextual memories and lower levels of PSD-95 and mature BDNF. We suggest that CM triggers excitotoxic mechanisms that could be responsible for neuronal loss and cognitive decline in animals recovering from CM. Understanding of the mechanisms that are associated with cognitive decline following CM will be an important step towards identifi cation of therapeutic targets and effective therapies. Interestingly, AIP protein expression is also reduced in approximately 50% of sporadic somatotropinomas, especially in more aggressive cases, but no somatic AIP mutation has been found. Recently, we have demonstrated that the microRNA miR-34a is overexpressed in sporadic somatotropinomas with low AIP protein levels in the absence of mutations in this gene. Functional studies confi rmed that miR-34a down-regulates AIP expression. Altogether, these data suggest the involvement of AIP and miR-34a in the pathogenesis of a subset of sporadic somatotropinomas.",

Transsphenoidal surgery is the fi rst-line treatment in most cases, except for prolactinomas. Somatostatin analogs (SA) and dopamine agonists (DA) are the main medical treatment used in patients with pituitary adenomas. The SA act through interaction with the somatostatin receptors, which are divided in fi ve subtypes (SSTR1 to 5). Similarly, DA interacts with dopamine receptors, which are also divided in fi ve subtypes (DR1 to 5). The expression of these receptors can be evaluated by several techniques, mainly PCR and immunohistochemistry. The most commonly used SAs are octreotide and lanreotide, which interact mainly with SSTR2 and to a lesser degree to SSTR5. On the other hand, the main DA available (cabergoline and quinagolide) interact basically with DR2. Both SSTR and DR are found in pituitary adenoma cells in variable amounts, depending on pituitary adenoma subtypes and individual characteristics. It has been shown that the effi cacy of SA and DA is dependent on the degree of the receptors expression. Recently, pasireotide, which binds to SSTR1, 2, 3 and 5, has been approved for the treatment of patients with corticotropinomas. Moreover, several SA, with different patterns of interaction with the SSTR, are under investigation. As well as chimeric molecules, which can bind to both SSTR and DR.

Nevertheless, there existed great inconsistencies among neuropathologists in the diagnoses of these tumors and even within the WHO scheme published in 2000, the glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component (GBM-O) was illustrated and briefl y discussed. After studies showed that the prognosis for patients with an AOA with necrosis was more similar to that for glioblastoma (GBM; WHO grade IV) than to the prognosis of grade III tumors, in the WHO 2007 classifi cation, GBM-O was introduced as a more formally accepted diagnosis. Subsequently, this change by the WHO put the controversial topic of GBM-O in the spotlight and multiple clinicopathological studies were performed investigating the value of GBM-O as a separate group. These studies provided contradictory results and made it clear that histopathological distinction of GBM-O from other high-grade gliomas can be challenging because easily reproducible criteria are lacking. In an era that tumor classifi cation is increasingly based on a combination of morphological and molecular information, it may well be that the diagnosis GBM-O is soon going to be replaced by a diagnosis of GBM, supplemented with information on the presence/absence of especially complete 1p/19q co-deletion and IDH1/IDH2 mutation.",

Our approach, dubbed \"Methylation-Analysis,\" is based on the analysis of approximately 200 ng of DNA derived from FFPE tissue. Our Methylation-Analysis-pipeline provides several highly valuable sets of information in a timely manner: -A classifi er matches the respective sample with data from the cases in the reference set thus providing a best fi t. This in many cases indicates a specifi c diagnosis and also allows further separation of established WHO entities into subsets of clinical relevance. -A copy number plot calculated from the array data provides valuable information such as 1p/19 losses, EGFR amplifi cation and other chromosomal alterations. -The methylation status of genes such as MGMT is given.

As such, interobserver concordance rates are suboptimal, with diagnostic changes being common during outside pathology reviews for patient care and central reviews for clinical trials. Lastly, it has become progressively apparent that despite histologic similarities, pediatric gliomas differ biologically from their adult counterparts. This has all led to huge frustrations among neuro-oncologists, with sometimes impassioned calls to completely abandon traditional light microscopy in favor of \"objective\" genetic analyses. Indeed, the last decade has brought remarkable advances, now allowing for incorporation of molecular data into glioma diagnosis. Nonetheless, we must avoid the temptation to leap too quickly into purely biomarker driven schemes that rely on insuffi ciently proven assumptions, ignore powerful and reproducible histopathologic parameters, or inappropriately combine newly fashioned molecular defi nitions of lineage with previously established morphology based grading criteria. Additionally, we should not forsake robust clinicopathologic variables and cost-effi cient diagnostic techniques in our haste to achieve greater interobserver reproducibility.

Only recently, though, direct evidence of the connections between autophagy genes dysfunction and human diseases has been shown. Many reports showing that mutations in the autophagy genes emerged in various human diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. It is not a surprise that mutations in genes regulating autophagy can cause neurodegenerative diseases. This is seen in relatively common disorders such as late-onset degenerative diseases (Alzheimer ' s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson ' s disease). The new aspects are that monogenic neurodegenerative disorders with early onset have been identifi ed as genetic disorders of autophagy dysfunction; in such diseases, defects arise at different stages of the autophagy pathway and have different implications for pathogenesis and therapy. Regarding therapy, pharmacological approaches to activate or inhibit autophagy are also important since autophagy can play either a protective or destructive role in many diseases, even in different stages of the same diseases.

PolyQ tracts mostly affect ubiquitous expressed proteins; however, their toxicity is limited to some neurons. Removing this toxic effect by RNA silencing might be a rationale treatment in future, but other treatments may play important roles. The CAGexp explains 50-70% of variation in age at onset; modifi er factors related to the other 30-50% variation could be targeted. Drugs such as lithium, a pharmacological agent related to increased autophagy, increased chaperones, and HDAC inhibition, have been tested in SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3/MJD; other compounds and study designs are envisioned. The overlap in disease phenotypes makes diagnosis dependent on molecular panels covering the majority of SCA loci, and reference centers prepared to receive samples from distant places were developed in Brazil and other countries.

We found a great reduction of neuronal numbers in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of demented patients with AD, but not of asymptomatic AD subjects, therefore concluding that neuronal loss is associated with dementia, not with plaques and tangles. Finally, we studied the infl uence of sex on cellularity of brain regions. Results showed a signifi cant sexual dimorphism in the olfactory bulb, favoring women with over 40% more neurons and glial cells than men; and in the hippocampal formation, favoring men with over 30% more neurons and glial cells.

Control cells were human pluripotent stem cells subjected to a similar differentiation protocol as the DA cells, but harvested 4 days before they start producing dopamine. Animals were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine A 1 day before and throughout the experiment. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological tests showed a clear improvement in motor behavior of animals transplanted with DA cells but not the control cells 12-13 weeks after transplantation. Persistent microglial activation at the site of transplantation was observed by MHC-II, ED-1 and GSA staining 90 days posttransplantation in DA 14 and control cells-treated animals. Similar experiments are being conducted in an infl ammation-based animal model of PD. We conclude that the transplant of this GMP-grade preparation of human DA neurons provides a robust motor recovery in the animals tested. In addition, the chronic infl ammation observed at the site of transplantation opens up the possibility of increasing neuronal survival and differentiation by immunomodulation. In this context, stem cells have been considered as potential therapies but many questions must be answered before entering clinical practice.",

The focus of this discussion will be neuromuscular disorders associated with dysfunction of the spinal motor neuron (motor neuronopathies) and its axon (axonopathies), which are severe conditions with no effective treatment available. Findings from animal models have so far translated poorly in clinical trials, underscoring the need for innovative methods to investigate the pathophysiology of these human disorders. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) offer an unlimited source of patient specifi c, disease-relevant cell lines that can be used as a platform for identifi cation of disease mechanisms, discovery of molecular targets and development of phenotypic screens for drug discovery. iPSC-based models of neuromuscular disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), have success-fully reproduced pathophysiological fi ndings from animal and other cellular models and have also identifi ed new disease mechanisms with potential therapeutic implications. This model is amenable to interrogation by multiple techniques, including gene expression profi ling, time-lapse microscopy, single-cell and multi-array electrophysiology and electron microscopy. The ability of this approach to detect treatment effects from known therapeutic compounds has also been demonstrated, providing proof of principle for the use of iPSC-derived cells in drug discovery. In summary, cellular reprogramming offers a new approach for the study of neurological disorders by making it possible to study human cell types directly related to their pathophysiology (neurons and glia) and to reproduce neuronal development in vitro .",

Although less severe, such changes were also observed in the other brain regions, including the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. The subcortical white matter of the motor area was severely rarefi ed with myelin pallor. In the spinal cord, loss of anterior horn cells and degeneration of the corticospinal tracts were evident. Immunostaining using an antibody against hyperphosphorylated tau revealed widespread occurrence of neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the central nervous system. The astrocytic tau lesions were those of globular astrocytic inclusions (GAIs), being different in morphology from astrocytic plaques in corticobasal degeneration (CBD) or tufted astrocytes in progressive supranucler palsy. A few globular oligodendrocytic inclusions were also observed in each affected regions. Of great interest was that although partially, the astrocytic lesions were also immunoreactive with an antibody against phosphorylated TDP-43. Immunoblotting of frozen brain samples revealed predominantly 4-reapt (4R) tau, with the approximately 37-kDa lowmolecular mass tau fragments characteristic of CBD.

Widespread application of phospho-tau immunohistochemistry revealed further tau pathologies and constellations of these. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus as to how these can be grouped or even what is the exact clinical relevance of these alterations. However, as a common feature tau astrogliopathy can be mentioned, which shows different morphologies and anatomical distribution. These tau pathologies may have variable infl uence on clinical presentations, depending on the presence of concomitant pathology and the individual ' s threshold for the development of clinical symptoms. Different descriptions most likely represent a spectrum or stages of similar conditions coined with different terms. From a practical aspect, based on our and others experience, the following patterns can be recognized: (1) Gallyas negative astrocytes with granular tau immunoreactivity in the processes in the medial temporal lobe grey matter associated with a few, mostly argyrophilic thorny astrocytes in the white matter and more in the subpial and subependymal region without overt symptoms of dementia; (2) rarely, prominent tau-astrogliopathy (either granular in processes, thorny and tufted-like) is restricted to the amygdala; (3) in some cases, the tau-astrogliopathy expands beyond the prominently affected medial temporal lobe and is associated with neuronal tau pathology, including pretangles in limbic cortices, basal ganglia, and substantia brain pathology nigra; (4) further cases are similar to the latter group, but additionally show a very distinct accumulation of thorn-shaped astrocytes in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Consensus nomenclature is needed for further research studies on various morphological forms of tauastrogliopathies in the elderly. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are key players in a death mechanism in which neutrophils release DNA traps decorated with elastase and histones to entangle pathogens. We showed that amyloid fi brils from three different sources ( \u03b1 -synuclein, Sup35 and transthyretin) induced NADPH oxidase-dependent NETs in vitro from human neutrophils. Surprisingly, NET-associated elastase digested amyloid fi brils into short species that were cytotoxic for BHK-21 and HepG2 cells. We observed in situ , NETs in amyloidotic deposits from amyloidotic patients which co-localized with amyloid deposits. These data reveal that NETs can be triggered by amyloid fi brils. Moreover, the involvement of NETs in amyloidoses might be crucial for the production of toxic species. In a second approach, we have investigated the pathogenic mechanism behind oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis (OA) caused by fi brillation of A25T-TTR. We have showed that fi brils of A25T activate microglia leading to secretion of TNF-\u03b1 , IL-6 and nitric oxide. A25T amyloid fi brils induce NF \u03ba B translocation to the nucleus of microglia. Exposure of neuronal cultures to conditioned media of fi bril-activated microglia causes synapse loss culminating in apoptosis of neurons. Finally, intracerebroventricular injection of A25T fi brils caused microgliosis and cognitive defi cits in mice, which could be prevented by minocycline. These results indicate that A25T fi brils act as infl ammatory agents, activating microglia and neuronal death.",

The most common mutation is where methionine replaces valine in position 30 (Val30Met). There are 664 families with 2657 patients mainly in Northern Portugal, 51% of the cases were diagnosed in the last two decades. The prevalence in Portugal is 1/1000being an endemic disease. The pathology consists on the deposition of amyloid in the connective tissue mainly in the peripheral nerves, dorsal root ganglia and the autonomic nervous system. CNS is also affected with leptomeningeal and subpial deposition of amyloid, also affecting the superfi cial cortical layers and choroid plexus. Over the last 40 years, around 1000 nerve, skin and salivary glands biopsies were studied and 30 autopsies were also performed in our department. Before molecular diagnosis of FAP was available, demonstration of amyloid deposition was required for diagnosis. Skin biopsies are almost as reliable as nerve but now salivary gland biopsies, a minimally invasive procedure, is the method of choice in our center to demonstrate and identify the type of amyloid, necessary to start treatment with the new amyloid stabilizer drugs or to be submitted to a liver transplant.",

These processes include dysregulation of the immune system, axonal and myelin injury, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, as well as repair. Identifi cation of changes in the miRNA profi les may offer some clues as to potential functional gene and protein targets of these miRs, and thus will help in the identifi cation of potential therapies directed toward these functions. Changes in miRNAs may be detected in tissue, blood and bonemarrow and lymphoid derived lymphocytes and monocytes. miRNA profi les have been compiled, and these have shown differences between patients and controls, both in the lesions and the NAWM, as well as between different sub-sets of the disease. Many of these changes may also be documented in EAE (experimental allergic encephalomyelitis). We, and others, have used laser capture of specifi cally-identifi ed cell types to identify the miRNA profi les in these cells found in both acute and chronic lesions. Differences have been detected in numerous miRNAs, of which miR-155 is among the most striking, especially noted with differential polarization in macrophage activation, associated with pro-infl ammatory destruction and anti-infl ammatory repair. CNS microglia and bone-marrow derived macrophages, identifi ed by new differential antibodies also show differential changes in the disease.

There are two pathogenetic types: cavitary and cavitating. The former is a static lesion, usually caused by a single necrotizing insult that overwhelms both axons and glia, such as perinatal ischemia. The latter is more dynamic and due to a multiphasic or chronic progressive degeneration of white matter that may primarily affect myelin, axons, glia, or blood vessels, such as leukodystrophies. In both types, supratentorial white matter is most severely affected, where severe axonal loss and an inadequate astrocytic response are necessary for cavitation to occur. In spite of considerable axonal loss in most leukodystrophies, cavitation is typically seen only in infantile Alexander ' s disease and vanishing white matter disease (VWM). In both, morphologically abnormal astrocytes are conspicuous, implying a defective astrocytic response. Functional studies confi rm this. VWM, due to mutations in eIF (eukaryotic initiation factor) 2B, is one of the most prevalent causes of cavitation. The most severe cavitation is usually seen in the infantileonset patients, but exceptions occur. Longitudinal MRI studies have provided insights into this cavitation, but have not answered why a defective universal housekeeping gene should manifest exclusively as a white matter disease. Recent neuropathologic investigations reveal roles for (1) activation of the unfolded protein response in white matter glia, resulting in concomitant and contradictory expression of proliferative, prosurvival and proapoptotic downstream effectors; (2) abnormal maturation of white matter glia; and (3) possible interference in the maturation of oligodendroglial progenitors by high molecular weight hyaluronan.",

Accumulated pathological and experimental evidences strongly suggest that astrocytic damage is the primary pathology and is far more severe than damages of myelin and neuron in NMOSD. Hence, we proposed that NMOSD should be classifi ed into a new entity of \"autoimmune astrocytopathic disease.\" On another front, there exist patients with clinical features of NMOSD who are consistently AQP4-IgG-seronegative despite the use of the most sensitive assays, and among those with AQP4-IgG-seronegative NMOSD, some are seropositive for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG.

Although it has been suggested that infl ammation plays a lesser part in the pathology of progressive MS, our data on over 480 brains in the MS Tissue Bank at Imperial shows a clear association between infl ammatory activity and clinical progression. Our studies of a large cohort of cases reveals that the presence of infl ammatory infi ltrates in the leptomeninges, both diffuse and tertiary lymphoid like structures, associates with increased demyelination, microglial activation, a gradient of neuronal loss and shorter disease duration. Analysis of meningeal gene expression of these cases reveals an increase in the expression of proinfl ammatory and cytotoxic cytokines (TNF, lymphotoxin, interferon gamma) and chemokines involved in T and B cell recruitment (CXCL9, CXCL13). Analysis of gene expression in the underlying cortical GM shows that there is an imbalance in the TNF signalling pathways such that the TNF/TNFR1 pathways via RIP1/RIP3 leading to necrotic cell death are increased in cases with high meningeal infl ammation, whereas the TNF/TNFR2 protective pathways via TRAF2/TAK1/NFkB are upregulated in cases with less meningeal infl ammation and reduced GM pathology. These results suggest that changes in the balance of TNF signalling as a result of meningeal infi ltration play a major role in cortical GM pathology in MS. Aluminum oxyhydroxide (alum), a nanocrystalline compound forming agglomerates, has been widely used as an adjuvant of vaccines since 1927. The mechanisms by which it stimulates immune responses remain poorly understood. Although generally well tolerated, alum may occasionally cause chronic health problems in presumably susceptible individuals. Some individuals may present with delayed onset of diffuse myalgia, chronic exhaustion and cognitive dysfunction, associated with long-term persistence (up to ears) of alum-loaded macrophages at site of i.m immunizations, forming the so-called macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF). Symptoms are consistent with the chronic fatigue/myalgic encephalitis (CFS/ME) syndrome, and were used as a paradigm of \"autoimmune/infl ammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants\" (ASIA). Cognitive dysfunction is reminiscent of that described in workers exposed to inhaled Al particles. Individual susceptibility factors may infl uence both alum biopersistence and diffusion away from injection sites. Biopersistent particles, e.g. fl uorescent alum-coated nanohybrids, injected into mouse muscle are captured by monocyte-lineage cells and then carried to distant organs, to draining lymph nodes, and then to blood, probably via the thoracic duct, with delayed and accumulative translocation to brain (microglial cells).",

The lesions are similar: demyelination and presence on EM examination of numerous polymorphous inclusions assuming a lamellar or pseudomyelinic appearance in any cell cytoplasm. Such lesions are also found in muscle. This abnormal accumulation of lipid material takes a long time to disappear after the drug has been withdrawn.

Cessation or diminution of the treatment usually stops progression of CIPN, except for platinum compounds: symptoms and signs may still progress or at least persist for several months. Several industrial chemicals can lead to PN: lead, arsenic, mercury, thallium. Also, many petroleum derivatives: solvents, gas, pesticides/ herbicides and plastics may induce PN: acrylamide, organophosphates, trichlorethylene, DDT, tetrachlorethane, pentachIorophenol. They still may be seen in emerging countries where environmental pollution and occupational exposure are poorly controlled.

There now exists numerous fi ndings suggesting connectional changes within the cortex. One early and important cell population in this regard is the cortical preplate: a collection of neurons located at the zone that will later be occupied by migrating cortical neurons. Many preplate neurons persist into the adult brain as the cortical subplate, and they play a role in neuronal patterning within the cortex, and are responsible for guiding thalamocortical and cortico-thalamic connections. In addition, they provide early coordinated activation of the overlying cortical layers and, in the adult, may serve an additional role as modulators of cortical afferents. Although many subplate neurons undergo apoptosis during development, in primates a substantial proportion of these cells are retained into adulthood. ASD individuals demonstrate supernumerary neuronal profi les within the white matter directly adjacent to the overlying cortex. Initial fi ndings indicate that many of these profi les show morphological characteristics of subplate neurons. Like in ASD, the presence of excessive neurons adjacent to the cerebral cortex has been shown in other neurological disorders such as schizophrenia (Eastwood & Harrison, 2003) and epilepsy (Emery et al ., 1997) . In these conditions, it has been hypothesized that these neurons contribute to disconnectivity in the mature brain (Kostovic et al ., 2011) . As such, excessive neuronal profi les in the subplate may be a contributor to both abnormal cortical development and disconnectivity in the ASD brain.",

We recently proposed four stages of TDP-43 pathology in ALS that suggest a spreading of TDP-43 directed outwardly from the motor neocortex, spinal cord and brainstem, whereas later stages are characterized by frontal, parietal and anteromedial temporal lobar involvement [1]. This sequence of involvement (and the neuro-axonal loss linked to cellular accumulation of TDP-43) has recently been corroborated in vivo using fi ber-tracking magnetic resonance imaging[3]. The frontal dissemination of TDP-43 pathology could explain why up to 50% of ALS patients develop cognitive defi cits related mainly to executive function. We review recent evidence on the dissemination of TDP-43 from cell culture and mouse model experiments as well as from human tissue studies.Presentation is usually in infancy or early childhood; although late adult onset or clinical heterogeneity among affected members family may also occur. Congenital hypotonia, muscle weakness, facial muscle involvement, ophthalmoplegia, diffi culties feeding and respiratory failure may be prominent. CK is low or normal and course may remain stable. Type 1 predominance/type 1 hypotrophy is typical as are characteristic structural changes, although members of the same family may have only type 1 predominance. Diagnosis may not be conclusive in early biopsies. Inheritance can be autosomal dominant (AD), X-linked, autosomal recessive (AR) or resulting from dominant de novo mutations. Most frequent entities: Nemaline myopathies, rods visible using Gomori ' s trichrome and EM, of variable clinical severity and age of onset, at least eight genes appear to be involved. NEB mutations, accounting for up to 50% of cases, as well as some core-rod and distal myopathies. ACTA 1, mostly de novo mutations, represent almost half of severe congenital cases.Core myopathies, with central or eccentric oxidative defects, Z line disruption and absence of mitochondria in the cores, may show severe neonatal presentation or milder forms. AD or AR related to RYR1 gene. CNM has been linked to at least four genes, XR-MTM1, DNM2, BIN1 and RYR1, with severe to mild presentation. Morphology fi ndings may orient genetic studies. Congenital fi bre type disproportion CFTD shares genes with most other congenital myopathies. Subsequent biopsies may reveal structural changes. Cases still remain with no genetic identifi cation.",

Following the emergence of variant CJD (vCJD) in 1996, enhanced surveillance was implemented in Europe and in some Latin American countries, where prion diseases became reportable disorders. CJD notifi cation became mandatory though not autopsy. Report of cases to referral centers must include clinical data, EEG, MRI and CSF for the detection of protein 14.3.3, requirements similar to those established by WHO and Euro-CJD. Based on provided data, cases are classifi ed as possible, probable or defi nite. Confi rmatory histopathologic diagnosis is not required for cases to be classifi ed as probable. Diagnosis of defi nite CJD requires neuropathological confi rmation and/or positive PrP SC WB although there may be protease sensitive cases. Defi nite cases are classifi ed following international consensus criteria based on PrP SC WB subtype and codon 129 polymorphism of the prion protein gene, histotyping may also be used. Updated decontamination methods need to be applied and genetic studies made available. Latin American reporting rates vary significantly given the territory ' s vast extent. Population clusters in large urban centers shows levels comparable to those of smaller, high population density countries in Europe. Some countries conduct surveillance for CJD or other prion diseases while others implement monitoring regulations: Argentina ' s incidence in 2013 was 0.82 cases/million (16% genetic out of a total of 368 defi nite and probable cases from 1997-2013, 14% CJD E200K mostly Chilean origin, one octarepeat insertion and 4 GSS PrP P102L ); Brazil reported 201 defi nite and probable cases for the last 10 years (7.4% genetic cases are mostly PrP E200K , 2 GSS PrP P102L , 3 PrP D178N -2 FFI and 1 CJD); Chile reported incidence approximately 3.6 cases/million (35% genetic PrP E200K ); Mexico reported 50-60 cases in the past 15 years (genetic cases associated to PrP E200K ); incidence in Uruguay is 0.7 cases/million(familial cases associated with PrP G114V and PrP E200K ); Colombia (Ministry of Health, mainly to exclude vCJD); Paraguay and Panam\u00e1.

Finally, prion disease transmissibility is thought to be helped by the structural similarity between the prion protein (PrP) of the donor and that of the host. We have probed the transmission of poorly transmissible prion diseases such as sFI, and variably protease sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr), a sporadic novel prion disease with features similar to GSS, using two sets of Tg mice as hosts: (1) Tg mice expressing normal human cellular PrP (PrP C ) [Tg(HuPrPC)] and",

Camargo; 4 Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo; 5 University of Rio de Janeiro Medical School, BrazilAbout 15% of the prion diseases are caused by different mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP). P102L mutation is usually associated with Gerstmann-Stra\u00fcssler-Scheinker (GSS) phenotype. Objective: To describe the phenotypic heterogeneity in a Brazilian family with P102L mutation. Methods: Patient 1 was seen in 2002 with an atypical dementia. We tracked all data from other affected members of the family. Results: Patient 1: woman, age at onset: 27 years old. Memory and attention defi cits; progression to severe dementia in 2 years; gait instability and language disturbances started 5 years later. MRI: brain atrophy, normal DWI. CSF 14.3.3: negative. EEG: non-specifi c changes. PRNP: 102L + 129M; 102P + 129V. Death: 15 years after onset. Neuropathology: PrPSc immunopositive plaques in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Minimal spongiosis. Patient 2 (uncle of no. 1): age at onset: 53 years old. Rapidly progressive dementia with myoclonus. MRI: frontal atrophy. EEG: nonspecifi c changes. Brain biopsy: spongiform encephalopathy. Death: 8 months after onset. PRNP: not available. Patient 3 (sister of no. 2): age at onset: 54 years old. Dizziness, cognitive decline, cerebellar ataxia and blindness. MRI: brain atrophy. Death: 4 years after onset. PRNP: 102L + 129M; 102P + 129M. Patient 4 (daughter of no. 3): age at onset: 36 years old. Progressive cerebellar ataxia, spasticity and feet numbness. Mild executive function defi cit after 2 years. Severe dementia 7 years after onset. MRI: cerebellar atrophy. PRNP: 102L + 129M; 102P + 129V. Death: 10 years after onset. Neuropathology: neuronal loss, spongiosis and gliosis. PrPSc immunopositive in synapses and in multicentric plaques. Patient 5 (mother of patient no. 1): age at onset 66 years old. Paresthesias in lower limbs and social withdrawn, followed by cerebellar ataxia and cognitive decline. MRI: non-specifi c changes. PRNP: 102L + 129M; 102P + 129M. Conclusions: Prion disease associated with P102L mutation presented with high clinical and pathological heterogeneity in this Brazilian family.Variant CJD (vCJD) was identifi ed in the UK in 1996; 177 cases have now occurred in the UK, with 52 cases in 11 other countries. vCJD results from infection with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent.",

            "text": ": As of June 2013, a total of 1744 subjects from 17 different countries were enrolled in THAOS, with64different TTR genotypes. Most patients from Brazil (94/105) and Argentina (38/40) carried the Val30Met mutation, where as the Ser50Arg mutation (27/34) was predominant in Mexico. Certain genotypes were generally associated with predominantly neuropathic (e.g. Val30Met) or predominantly cardiac (e.g. Val122Ileor wild-type) symptoms. Analysis of the prevalence of ATTR symptoms in patients from major genotype groups categorized by the duration of their symptoms provides insights into the natural course of ATTR. Conclusions: The large dataset from the THAOS registry presents a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the diverse presentations and the natural disease progression of ATTR.

It has long been appreciated that the two most important prognostic variables for meningioma patients are extent of surgical resection and histopathologic grade. Grading criteria have varied greatly over time, with the current 2007 WHO scheme largely derived from data reported in two large Mayo Clinic series published in the late 1990s. Since that time, the clinicopathologic associations have been independently validated, despite some concerns that the grade II category has become too commonplace. Of interest, a recent RTOG clinical trial revealed home pathology/central pathology concordance rates of 86.7%, 81.7%, and 94.0% for WHO grades I, II, and III respectively, suggesting substantial agreement for overall grade and moderate to substantial agreement over individual grading criteria. The derivation of the current grading scheme and remaining controversies will be discussed, along with the remaining need to develop better diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers for routine clinical practice. Two potentially sensitive and specifi c markers that were recently reported include somatostatin receptor 2A (SSTR2A) and STAT6 immunostains for diagnoses of meningioma and hemangiopericytoma/solitary fi brous tumor respectively. Additionally, genetic advances beyond the role of the NF2 gene will be highlighted briefl y. These include the recently identifi ed driver mutations of TRAF7, KLF4, AKT, and SMO genes, along with studies of progression associated alterations, such as CDKN2A gene deletions on chromosome 9.Kalamarides MDepartment of Neurosurgery, Inserm U1127, Hopital Pitie-Salpetri\u00e8re, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France",

            "text": "Global petrol consumption for motor vehicle use is increasing with over 5 trillion liters used in 2012. Exposure to petrol, predominantly C4-12 alkanes, but with benzene, toluene and other components, is normally controlled and consequently toxicity is very low. Deliberate exposure to petrol as part of volatile solvent abuse (VSA) through huffi ng, bagging, or ragging is however, highly addictive and associated with a range of neuropathologies depending on petrol composition. At a gross level, oxygen displacement from the lungs causes relative anoxia and in severe cases hypoxic CNS damage. Due to the solvent effect and possibly through an action on GABA and glutamate transmission, there are disinhibition, disorientation and visual disturbances. Past use of tetra-ethyl lead is associated with lead encephalopathy in VSA individuals, with symptoms including abnormal deep tendon refl exes, frontal release signs, with decreased pattern recognition and visuospatial abnormalities on neuropsychological testing. Pathologically, changes correspond to classical lead poisoning with widespread vascular hemorrhages, focal demyelination and hippocampal necrosis though neurofi brillary tangles seen with typical lead encephalopathy have not been described. The presence of neuropathy and cognitive changes following unleaded petrol abuse suggests other petrol constituents are neurotoxic. One component, n-hexane, is associated with a predominantly reversible distal sensory neuropathy showing giant axonal change due to the toxic metabolite 2,5hexandione, which in severe cases can result in central changes. Reports suggest that areas with very high car-related pollution levels are associated with neurodegenerative pathology particularly in the olfactory bulbs with \u03b1 -synuclein and also A \u03b2 42 deposition.Sampling and processing the nervous system in preclinical species for general toxicity studies Pardo ID Regulatory Toxicologic Pathology at Pfi zer, Inc, Groton, CT, USA Evaluation of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves is important in nonclinical general toxicity studies and in evaluation of animal models of neurodegenerative diseases and brain or spinal cord injury. To screen for neurotoxicity in routine animal toxicity studies in rodents, rabbits, monkeys, dogs, and pigs, the Society of Toxicologic Pathology recommends evaluation of 6-7 sections of the brain (at the levels of the frontal pole, anterior commissure, rostral thalamus, caudal thalamus, middle cerebellum with brainstem, and occipital lobe), three sections of spinal cord (cervical, thoracic and lumbar) and cross and longitudinal sections of at least one nerve (usually the sciatic nerve). The most important neuroanatomic areas included in this routine sampling protocol will be briefl y reviewed with emphasis on animal toxicity. Examples of microscopic lesions will include neuronal necrosis and axonal degeneration caused by glucokinase activators in NHPs, infl ammation of the choroid plexus related to complement activation caused by a monoclonal antibody in a NHP, neuronal degeneration caused by a noncompetitive N-methyl D-aspartate antagonist in rats, hippocampal necrosis caused by trimethyl tin in rats, and intramyelinic edema caused by hexachlorophene in rats. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental disorder with a seemingly confusing and uncertain pathogenesis. The defi nitive mechanisms that promote autism are poorly understood and mostly unknown, yet available theories do focus on the disruption of normal cerebral development. Although there is no clear pathway or simple pathogenesis, there are several important theories including neural connectivity, neural migration, excitatory-inhibitory neural activity, dendritic morphology, neuro-infl ammatory, calcium signaling and mirror neurons, which may offer an explanation of the development of ASD or at least aspects of the phenotype. In this workshop, you will hear about the neuropathology of ASD and experimental work in animal models and humans that have advanced our understanding of this complex neurodevelopmental disorder. In my short introduction, I shall focus on the genomic studies that have revealed that a substantial proportion of ASD risk resides in high-impact rare varia-",

            "text": "In collaboration with neuropathology educators worldwide, we surveyed the mechanisms used for training neuropathologists. In general, recruitment is non-systematic relying on encouraging interested candidates through medical school and neuroscience research training environments. Six countries have structured neuropathology training systems that allow entry directly from medical school (i.e. a primary specialty). Others consider neuropathology a subspecialty, usually of anatomical pathology. The process for admission into the training programs varies. Some countries have a nationwide interview process and a centralized matching process (e.g. Canada, UK). Others (e.g. US) rely on site-specifi c recruitment, although the advantages of a matching system for undersubscribed postings are recognized. In jurisdictions with national oversight the training routes are remarkably similar. Most have a defi ned set of core competencies for diagnostic neuropathology overlaid with more general competencies required for any type of medical specialist. Eligibility for certifying examinations requires completion of a time-based training program that typically involves 3-4 years core neuropathology for the primary specialty or 2 years for the subspecialty. As a small discipline, one of the common diffi culties for educators is teaching in the subspecialty areas of neuropathology. This is addressed through the offering of defi ned courses offered through national societies or supranational societies (e.g. EuroCNS). Some countries (e.g. Canada) are developing web-based lecture series to complement local training. One long-term challenge for educators will be to ensure that diagnostic neuropathology integrates rather than relegates evolving complementary methods such as genetic testing and advanced imaging and microscopy methods.",

At autopsy, however, \u223c 25% of cases do not fi t expected neurofi brillary tangle distribution according to Braak staging (Murray et al . 2011) . Two atypical subtypes of AD were found based on the relative sparing of the hippocampus (i.e. hippocampal sparing [HpSp] AD) compared to the cortex, and the predominant involvement of hippocampus and amygdala (i.e. limbic predominant [LP] AD). Using thiofl avin-S microscopy, we designed a mathematical algorithm to identify the atypical and typical AD cases in order to investigate clinicopathologic differences. HpSp AD and LP AD not only differed neuropathologically, but also showed distinct demographic and clinical patterns. Across each variable, HpSp AD and LP AD greatly contrasted with typical AD centered between the two. HpSp AD were more often male, younger at age onset, had shorter disease duration, and had an underrepresentation of the APOE \u03b5 4 genotype and MAPT H1H1 haplotype. Further studies validated differences using both immunohistochemistry and structural neuroimaging. Future studies will seek to utilize these AD subtypes as a specifi c phenotype to help inform both the genetics and atypical clinical presentations to inform the differential diagnosis of AD dementia.",
