The HI test was performed in V-shaped microtitre trays using 8 haemagglutinating units of virus, serial twofold dilutions of serum inactivated at 56OC for 30 minutes and 0.75% suspension of chicken erythrocytes. All serums were treated with a 25% suspension of acid washed kaolin in borate saline at pH 9.0 and adsorbed against chicken erythrocytes prior to testing. The virus-serum mixtures were allowed to react for 60 minutes and the test was read at room temperature 45 minutes after the addition of erythrocytes. An HI titre of 1 in 16 and greater was considered to be indicative of HEV specific antibody. A total of 364 serums from 24 herds (a minimum of 10 serums per herd) were examined. Ten of the 24 herds were found to have specific antibody, with the HI titre of most serums from infected herds being 1:64 to 1:128. Retrospective examination of stored serum revealed the presence of specific antibody in serum collected from herds of pigs in 1972, 1973 and 1974. These herds had experienced outbreaks of a syndrome resembling Vomiting and Wasting Disease as described by Cartwright ec al(1969) but the virus had not been isolated.",
