            "text": "APOBEC3 enzymes form part of the innate immune system by deaminating cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and thereby preventing the spread of pathogenic genetic information. However, APOBEC mutagenesis is also exploited by viruses and cancer cells to increase rates of evolution, escape adaptive immune responses, and resist drugs. This raises the possibility of APOBEC3 inhibition as a strategy for augmenting existing antiviral and anticancer therapies. Here we show that, upon incorporation into short ssDNAs, the cytidine nucleoside analogue 2\u2032-deoxyzebularine (dZ) becomes capable of inhibiting the catalytic activity of selected APOBEC variants derived from APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, and APOBEC3G, supporting a mechanism in which ssDNA delivers dZ to the active site. Multiple experimental approaches, including isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence polarization, protein thermal shift, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy assays, demonstrate nanomolar dissociation constants and low micromolar inhibition constants. These dZ-containing ssDNAs constitute the first substrate-like APOBEC3 inhibitors and, together, comprise a platform for developing nucleic acid-based inhibitors with cellular activity.",

A range of genetic, biochemical, and structural studies has combined to implicate A3B as the primary source of these mutations and A3A and A3H as potential secondary sources (depending on patient genotype and tumor type). APOBEC mutagenesis has been shown to contribute to both clonal and subclonal mutational events, 17, 18 and its frequency often increases from primary to metastatic disease. 16 A3B expression levels and APOBEC signature mutations also correlate with poor clinical outcomes, including disease recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance. 15, 19, 20 These observations support a model in which APOBEC mutagenesis promotes tumor evolution and strongly influences disease trajectories. Therefore, chemical modulators of APOBEC activity may yield useful chemical probes for mechanistic studies and, possibly, therapeutic compounds to harness APOBEC mutagenesis. 21 The mechanism of cytosine deamination for APOBECs is thought to be similar to that for cytidine deaminase (CDA), an enzyme that processes individual nucleosides. 22 The cytidine analogues zebularine [Z ( Figure 1B) ], 2\u2032-deoxyzebularine (dZ), and tetrahydrouridine (THU) are known transition-state analogues (TSAs) of cytidine deaminase (CDA). 23 \u221225 These competitive inhibitors bind tightly to the active site of CDA, as indicated by crystal structures. 23 \u221228 Here we show that these TSAs as free nucleosides do not alter the activity of A3 enzymes ( Figure S1 ), but micromolar-potent A3 inhibitors are obtained upon introduction of dZ in place of the target 2\u2032-deoxycytidine in DNA substrates (dZ-ssDNA). These findings open new avenues for further investigations of interactions between active A3 enzymes and ssDNA and, importantly, for the rational design of competitive A3 inhibitors for use with living cells.",

A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3 and A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3-E255A were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Lucigen), and A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3-AL1swap was expressed in E. coli strain C41(DE3)-pLysS (Lucigen). The E. coli culture was grown at 37\u00b0C in LB medium; once the mid log growth phase had been reached, the culture was supplemented with 100 \u03bcM zinc chloride, before protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and overnight incubation at 18\u00b0C. A3B CTD -DM was expressed and purified as reported in ref 31. A3G CTD (residues 191\u2212384, wt) was purified as described previously. 32 The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused A3G CTD was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells overnight at 17\u00b0C. After being harvested, the cells were resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and lysed by sonication. After ultracentrifugation at 25000g for 10 min, the supernatant was added to glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose, which was subsequently washed. For kinetic analysis, the GST fusion protein was eluted from the Sepharose matrix with 100 mM GSH in phosphate buffer. By using filtration at 4000g, the buffer was changed to a solution containing 75 mM sodium phosphate and 75 mM citrate (pH 5.5).",

Given that different A3 proteins 13, 36 have varying preferences for nucleobases surrounding the target cytosine, the sequences surrounding the zebularine moiety were chosen to match the preferred ssDNA recognition motif. To study A3\u2212ssDNA binding, we used the inactive A3A-E72A mutant, where the active-site glutamic acid is replaced with alanine, to avoid complications of deamination reactions occurring when the ligand contained cytosine. The E72A mutation does not change the geometry of the active site, as water was observed in the crystal structure instead of the glutamate side chain. 42 As A3A is a highly active enzyme with the highest affinity for DNA among human A3 catalytically active domains, 29, 36 it is best suited for binding assays. Two methods widely applied for binding characterization were used: fluorescence polarization (FP) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which yield the indirectly determined dissociation constant K d FP [sometimes termed K i (see the Supporting Information)] 43\u221245 and the directly measured dissociation constant K d ITC , respectively. FP measurements were taken in competitive mode, where unlabeled ssDNA competed with the fluorescently labeled ssDNA for the protein ( Figure S2 ). This results in dissociation constants K d FP ( Table 1 ) that should be directly comparable with K d ITC , assuming that the binding of the unlabeled ssDNA and the binding of fluorescently labeled ssDNA to the protein are identical. As a positive control, K d FP for the nonlabeled ssDNA (Oligo-10) was 34 \u00b1 2 nM compared to the directly measured value of 19 \u00b1 2 nM for titration of the fluorescently tagged Oligo-10. The differences between the two values are likely attributable to the experimental conditions (competitive displacement with a nonlabeled oligo vs direct binding with a fluorescently labeled oligo). Weaker binding of ssDNA containing dU (Oligo-11; K d FP = 1800 \u00b1 300 nM), as a negative control, compared to dC is in accord with published data 29, 46, 47 and highlights the binding specificity. The dZ-modified DNA had an affinity for A3A-E72A lower than that of the dCcontaining substrate [for Oligo-15, K d FP = 290 \u00b1 20 nM; for Oligo-10, K d FP = 34 \u00b1 2 nM (Table 1 and vide subra)]. The affinity of the dZ-modified DNA was still substantially higher than that of the dU-containing ssDNA that mimics the product of deamination [Oligo-15 vs Oligo-11 (Table 1) ]. The comparison of Oligo-10, -12, -13, and -14 shows some increase in binding affinity with a length from seven to ten nucleotides and no further increase in binding affinity up to 13 nucleotides (Oligo-13).",

            "text": "ITC experiments 29 (Table 2) were initially performed in a high-salt buffer (800 mM ionic strength), which was necessary for sample stability over the multiday, multidimensional NMR measurements. 29 For Oligo-1 (20-mer, A 8 T 2 CA 9 ) and the much shorter Oligo-2 (9-mer, AT 3 CAT 3 ) with a different sequence, very similar dissociation constants (K d ITC ) of 24 \u00b1 7 and 25 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM, respectively, were obtained (Table 2) , the former value being the same as that reported previously. 29 Given the very marked differences from the FP dissociation constants, further studies proceeded in buffer with a lower salt concentration (medium buffer, 150 mM ionic strength), comparable to that for FP measurements. The new K d ITC values obtained for Oligo-1 and Oligo-2 were more than 100 times lower than values measured in the high-salt buffer (Table 2) . Moreover, differences in binding were now evident, such that the 20-mer bound nearly twice as strongly (K d ITC = 0.11 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bcM) as the 9-mer (K d ITC = 0.20 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcM). Further shortening of the DNA sequence to five nucleotides resulted in a decreased affinity for the protein (Oligo-4, -5, and -6 compared to Oligo-3 in Table 2 ), showing that binding affinity increases with oligo length and confirming that a length of \u223c9\u221210 nucleotides is a good compromise between the length of the oligo and binding affinity. This length is used here and was used previously in NMR activity assays. 32, 48 In general, K d FP values were somewhat lower than K d ITC values (Tables 1 and 2) , which can likely be attributed to differences in experimental conditions: competition binding studies for K d FP versus direct binding experiments for K d ITC . Additionally, the different concentrations of assay components used may contribute to different oligomeric states of the protein, thereby affecting the measured binding affinities. The oligomeric state of A3A-E72A under these conditions warrants further investigation. Nonetheless, consistent trends were observed between these two biophysical methods. Shortening of the oligo resulted in a reduced level of binding to A3A-E72A in both methods [Oligo-4 and -5 vs Oligo-3 (Tables 1 and 2 )], consistent with the published data. 47 In parallel with FP results and despite the different oligo sequences that were used, introduction of dZ into the ssDNA sequence (for Oligo-7, K d ITC = 0.97 \u00b1 0.15 \u03bcM) resulted in weaker binding, relative to that of the corresponding cytidine-containing ssDNA (for Oligo-3, K d ITC = 0.24 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcM); specifically, 8.5-and 4-fold increases in K d FP and K d ITC , respectively, were observed ( Table 2 ). The addition of a 5methyl substituent to dZ (dZ Me ), Oligo-8, had a negligible effect on binding relative to that of unmethylated Oligo-7 (Table 2) . This impaired binding of transition-state analogues, dZ-or dZ Me -ssDNA, to the E72A mutant, compared to substrate, is consistent with Glu72 being a critical residue in the formation of the transition state for active A3 enzymes.",

The A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3 enzyme has the essential glutamic acid in the active site but because of the removal of loop 3 is only very weakly active in vitro: 31 low conversion of the substrate to the product was detected by 1 H NMR spectroscopy only after incubation overnight ( Figure S4 ). The interaction of TSA with the active site is not likely to be affected by the deletion of loop 3 from these proteins, as the loss of deaminase activity and associated binding affinity is due to effects outside of the active site. Deaminase activity can be restored by swapping loop 1 of A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3 with loop 1 of A3A, yielding the active A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3-AL1swap enzyme. 31 On the other hand, in the A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3-E255A mutant the active-site glutamic acid (equivalent to Glu72 in A3A) is replaced with alanine. Therefore, these proteins provide a unique pair for evaluating the importance of the catalytic glutamate for binding of dZcontaining oligos.",

Usually, a higher thermal stability is associated with the strong binding of the ligand, in our case ssDNA, to the protein. We observed that the level of binding of oligos to inactive A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3-E255A is significantly lower than to weakly active A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3, which retains the catalytic glutamic acid. Moreover, for A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3, the \u0394T m value for dZ-containing Oligo-9 is 0.72 \u00b1 0.10\u00b0C higher than that for the substrate containing dC (in Figure 2 , see the 95% confidence interval), which is the expected result for an ssDNA that bears a TSA instead of dC. For the binding of inactivated A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3-E255A to different DNA oligos, the binding of dZ oligo cannot be distinguished from binding of the substrate, illustrating the importance of the active-site glutamate for binding of transition-state analogues. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the choice of buffer, especially the ionic strength, affects strongly, by several orders of magnitude, the affinity of ssDNA for the A3 proteins. Moreover, binding of inactive protein to ssDNA-containing TSA is not a reliable predictor of inhibitory potential of these oligonucleotides. Therefore, we decided to use our previously described NMR-based activity assay 32 to assess directly the inhibition of substrate deamination in fully active A3 enzymes by ssDNAcontaining TSAs.",

The behavior of A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3-AL1swap 30 (see a description of the enzyme in Figure S3 ), which has loop 1 of A3A transplanted into A3B CTD , was intermediate between previously reported activities for A3A 40 and A3G CTD , 32 consistent with the previously reported data. 36 However, the k cat of A3B CTD -DM [DM, double mutant (see Figure S3 )] was anomalously low [0.008 \u00b1 0.001 s \u22121 compared to 0.10 \u00b1 0.04 s \u22121 for A3G CTD 32 ( Table 3) ]. Residual enzyme activity in the presence of dZ-ssDNA inhibitors was monitored directly by our NMR method. 32, 48 Only the use of dZ instead of dC in the preferred A3G CTD substrate [Oligo-7 versus Oligo-9 ( Figure 3A,B) ] conferred significant inhibition of A3G CTD deaminase activity. dZ Me -ssDNA (Oligo-8) had a marginal effect on the conversion of the preferred A3G CTD substrate (AT 2 C 3 A 2 T 2 , Oligo-3) ( Figure 3A ). These data are consistent with 5-Me-cytidine being a much poorer substrate than cytidine for A3 proteins, with the exception of A3H. 51\u221253 Therefore, for further investigations, we focused on the evaluation of dZ-containing oligos. For both A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3-AL1swap and A3B CTD -DM ( Figure 3 and the Supporting Information), using preferred substrate 5\u2032-AT 3 CAT 3 (Oligo-2), significant inhibition was observed with dZ-ssDNA [Oligo-9 ( Figure 3C,D) ]. The linear dependence of inverse deamination speed on inhibitor concentration was analyzed as described in the Supporting Information, assuming competitive inhibition, yielding micromolar inhibition constants (K i ) ( Figure 3B\u2212D) . In particular, for A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L3-AL1swap, the K i and K d ITC for Oligo-9 are very similar, 7.5 \u00b1 1.7 and 5.5 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcM, respectively ( Figure 3C and Table 2 ). No binding of Oligo-7 (or any other oligo) to A3G CTD (or catalytic mutant) was seen by ITC [75 mM sodium phosphate and 75 mM citrate (pH 5.5)] due to the low DNA binding affinity for A3G CTD [K m (Oligo-3) \u2248 600 \u03bcM, and K i (Oligo-7) \u2248 50 \u03bcM] and low protein solubility.",

            "text": "Article indicates that the glutamate in the active site is strongly involved in interaction with the transition state of deamination. These data are consistent with a model in which the Glu modifies the TSA by protonation of N3 of the nucleobase causing the addition of a water molecule to the C4 of dZ, as established for CDA. 54 In addition, our data clearly show an influence of buffer on dissociation constants, with a high ionic strength (800 mM) depressing the affinity by more than 2 orders of magnitude relative to that with a medium ionic strength (\u223c100 mM). Our observation that dZ Me in the structure of ssDNA did not provide Biochemistry Article significant inhibition of A3G CTD is consistent with earlier observations that 5-Me-cytidine was not deaminated by A3G CTD . 51\u221253 On the other hand, dZ instead of dC in ssDNA produced competitive, micromolar inhibitors of A3G CTD , A3B CTD -QM-\u0394L-AL1swap, and A3B CTD -DM. The fact that dZ and dZ Me used in the same oligo sequence had different inhibitory effects on A3G CTD under identical conditions means that structure of the TSA determines the inhibitory potential of the TSA-containing oligo. Moreover, adjacent nucleotides proximal to the TSA define the selectivity for binding and concomitant inhibition of a particular A3 family member as in the case of selective inhibition of A3G CTD by Oligo-7 and not by Oligo-9 ( Figure 3A ). These sequence-dependent molecular recognition properties provide opportunities for the design of specific inhibitors of A3 family members. Through high-throughput screening efforts, covalent small molecule A3G inhibitors with low micromolar potencies have been identified. 33, 55 To date, no small molecule A3A or A3B inhibitors have been reported. Chemically modified ssDNAs have been utilized in previous studies to understand the deamination of cytosine in the absence of structural information about the ssDNA/A3 complex. 56 Here, we evaluated chemically modified ssDNAs as potential A3 inhibitors and found similar (micromolar) inhibition constants as found for small molecule A3G inhibitors. An approximately 10\u221230-fold decrease in the apparent inhibition constants (K i ) of dZ oligos over K m of the corresponding dC-containing substrates was observed in our study. In comparison, zebularine as an individual nucleoside shows a 100-fold lower K i in comparison to the K m of cytidine for CDA. 54 This indicates that the preferences for TSA vary between A3 and CDAs. In addition, the strength of binding of the dZ-ssDNA to the A3 enzyme may be mediated by the interactions of surrounding nucleotides with amino acids close to the active site. The latter possibility is supported by the fact that introduction of modified nucleotides at positions \u22122 to +1 substantially affected the rate of deamination (target dC has number 0, nucleotides in the 5\u2032-direction have a minus sign, and nucleotides in the 3\u2032-direction have a plus sign). 56 Recent work has revealed that ssDNA adopts a U-shape for the target dC to enter the active site of the protein, 29, 30, 42 such that nucleotides at positions \u22122, \u22121, and +1 have strong interactions with the proteins, as well. Our previously published NMR-based method of small changes shows additional transient interactions with nucleotides farther from the active site. 29 This also correlates with our observations that short DNA sequences (5-mers) bind much more weakly than longer ssDNAs (>9-mers) to A3A-E72A (Tables 1 and 2 ) and with the results of other groups. 39, 40, 47 The observed inhibition of A3 enzymes by dZ-ssDNAs highlights the importance of Glu72 for A3A (Glu255 for A3B CTD and Glu259 for A3G CTD ) in controlling substrate and dZ-ssDNA binding. Therefore, development of A3 inhibitors based on TSAs that specifically react with the active-site water requires evaluation on active enzymes in contrast to the common practice of evaluation of binding to inactive active-site mutants.",
