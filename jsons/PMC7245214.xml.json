There are reports of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the stool of infected individuals in the Netherlands, USA, France and Australia [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. Another study by [10] showed potential evidence of the faecal-oral transmission of SARS- CoV, and hence concerns have been raised regarding the spread of this virus through the water system. Water treatment systems play a significant role in public health protection. Treated wastewater has a wide range of uses from drinking, recreational purposes like a spa or an open pool for irrigation and food production [11]. With the potential for being part of the environmental transmission, a significant concern regarding the safety of drinking water, wastewater sanitation as well as the sewages was raised. In addition, the role of biofilms has also been questioned since it is possible for slimy bacteria that form a thin coat over the pipelines to aid in the spread of the virus [12]. This article discusses the current water management system and the benefits of installing a monitoring tool in wastewater treatment facilities.",

A study using SARS and poliovirus showed that the survival of the viruses decreased drastically when factors such as temperature, organic matter, light exposure, and aerobic microorganisms were unfavourable for the viruses under study. The use of detergents, solvents, and protozoa is also capable of inactivating viruses [17]. For the virus to infect a person through water, it is necessary to survive through the treatment process and retain its infectivity before coming in contact with a host, which is very unlikely [18]. Studies have shown that the rate of inactivation of SARS is faster than poliovirus, which indicates that enveloped viruses are unstable, and the mode of transmission through wastewater is unlikely [17].",

Pre-treatment methods such as wet-oxidation, microwave, and ultrasonic waves can also be implemented before the effluent enters the treatment routine.

These viral communities display characteristics similar to a bacterial biofilm and exhibit a rare propagation mechanism by forming a carbohydrate-rich scaffold that aids in an attachment to the T-cell surface and encapsulation of the virion. The infected cells within this matrix provide a compatible surface for increased viral adhesion, cohesiveness, and dispersion. This process proves that specific viruses have a certain range of control over the extracellular matrix through biofilm formation [23]. Pais-Correia et al., further explained that various virus-induced components like collagen and agrin govern the formation of a biofilm and other linker proteins, including tetherin and galectin-3, facilitate cell-to-cell interactions [24]. A striking difference in the propagation was observed in both microorganisms isolated from free-flowing as well as stagnant wastewater and those thriving in a biofilm. Research indicates that the virus persists longer in biofilm than compared to wastewater [24] [25].",

Since it is nearly impossible to test every individual during a community spread of the COVID-19 pandemics, it is necessary to locate the hotspots of the disease and begin isolation and treatment from there. Environmental surveillance is a tool used to monitor the extent and duration of the spread of the virus in specific populations. It can give a measure of contaminants and also warn us of possible threats emerging in that particular confinement [33]. Monitoring tools have already been successfully implemented for viruses like poliovirus and Aichi virus [30] [31], which have aided in strategies that resulted in their elimination. The efficiency of a monitoring tool depends on various factors such as geographical location, general sanitary, climatic conditions, sampling methods like trap sampling, precipitation methods, charge-based filters, and detection methods [34]. A significant shortcoming of wastewater screening techniques is the inability to recognize individuals from the affected area [35] [36].",

It will be easier to survey regions for viral infections, especially in the asymptomatic cases of COVID -19, comprehensively and in real-time [9] [41]. Another advantage of wastewater monitoring is the possibility to detect variations of viral strains through phylogenetic studies [9]. Several studies have used WBE for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with no significant outcome [38] [30] [42] [43]. There are approximately 105,600 wastewater treatment facilities globally.

Since there are several cases of asymptomatic infections of COVID \u2013 19, it will be useful to identify the populations with these carriers to prevent further spread of this virus. The study by Gundy et al. [17] showed that SARS survives in wastewater for a limited time. The number of viruses present in the water is proportional to the number of infected individuals in the area. By constantly monitoring the levels of these viruses, it is possible to determine the spread of the COVID \u2013 19 infections. This tool will serve as an efficient and sensitive monitoring tool to measure virus levels in hotspot populations and provide early warning signs before a potential epidemic in the future. A major drawback of this tool is the lack of detection of enveloped viruses during the treatment process, the need for special laboratory skills as well as sustainable financial resources. It will be invaluable to develop direct detection methods like ELISAs, RT \u2013 PCR, digital RT \u2013 PCR, multiplex PCR, cDNA microarrays, Isothermal nucleic acid amplification-based methods, or the newly discovered paper-based device for coronaviruses in these wastewater treatment facilities [46] [47] [48]. Another aspect to be noted is sensitivity. The tools should be sensitive enough to capture even the smallest amount of viral infection during the initial stages to prevent the spread of viral particles.",

These nanofibers are effective in isolating pathogens using a polyurethane nanofiber material (147nm), which is active in filtering intestinal enterococci, E. coli, and coliform bacteria [49]. Characterization of the nanofiber membranes could be achieved by Fourier transform infrared spectrometers with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR), scanning electron microscopy, surface area analysis, and contact angle measurements. The bioengineering of these nanofibers with specific binding sites increases the specificity towards its target, in this case, SARS-CoV-2 [49]. This pre-treatment technique has proven effective in filtration. These flat sheet membranes are electrospun with a range of functionalizing agents such as nanosilver, bronopol and WSCP (Poly[(dimethylimino)(2-hydroxy-1,3-propanedily) chloride] based on the required pore size and colony-forming units of the microorganism. Although there is a high risk of losing functionality during leaching, the microorganism removal capacity of these nanofibers was shown to be preserved [50]. Hence, we propose that a custom-made, removable, electrospun nanofiber membrane with a positive charge could be effective in attracting the genetic material of a virus, making it a potential monitoring tool. This membrane, when lysed using standard protocols [50], would give a higher yield of the genetic material when compared to isolation from a crude sample.",

Providing additional treatments to the wastewater before it enters the treatment routine, thus upgrading the existing process, is a well-conceived notion. Home-made treatments like boiling and large-scale processes like ultrafiltration, inactivation by ultraviolet irradiation, and chlorination are promising tactics that can be used to upgrade the treatment, especially in pandemic hotspots. An investigation of the spread of viruses through biofilms also needs to be better prepared for future situations. Once the countermeasures of social distancing are uplifted, and people return to their routine lifestyle, there is a high probability of the re-emergence of this virus. Hence, facilities like a monitoring tool for increased scrutiny of wastewater treatment industries must be enforced to minimize public health risks. An efficient monitoring tool can serve as an alarm when there is an increase in virus particles above the threshold levels, thus allowing us to act faster and contain the infection before it spreads at an alarming rate.",
