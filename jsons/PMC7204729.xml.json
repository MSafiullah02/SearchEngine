In addition, they may also be worried about passing infection with SARS-CoV-2 to colleagues, family, and other patients. When a physician\u2019s focus is directed toward the self, it becomes challenging to redirect attention to the patient. As a result, medical errors may occur.3 Risk and uncertainty can also create a chronic state of hyper-alertness, which can lead to poor decision making and even unprofessional behavior.4\n,\n5\n",
