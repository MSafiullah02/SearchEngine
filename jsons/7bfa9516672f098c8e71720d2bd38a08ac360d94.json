Virus particles identified as rotaviruses, coronaviruses, calci-like viruses, astroviruses, parvoviruses, and several others have been detected by direct electron microscopy of ultracentrifuged samples of diarrhoeic faeces from young animals and human infants over the past 20 years. Despite numerous studies on the many aetiological agents associated with neonatal viral diarrhoea in recent years (Tzipori 1985) , the challenge for today's new veterinary graduate is similar to that faced by Bill Snowdon when he graduated from the University of Sydney in 1948. When investigating outbreaks of diarrhoea in calves, piglets, foals, kids, and lambs in the field, or in various species of wildlife kept in zoos, it is still difficult to know which bacteria, viruses or protozoa are responsible for the diarrhoea (Blood and Radostits 1989).",

Experimental transmission in gnotobiotic neonates and detailed pathological studies have confirmed their pathogenic potential.

The severity of rotavirus infection in young animals is influenced by the presence of colostral antibody in the intestine, and absorbed antibody is not protective. The morbidity rate in beef and dairy herds varies from herd to herd and from year to year and ranges from 5 to 80010. Mortality varies from 5% to 60% and probably depends on the level of colostral immunity in the calves, the prevalence of enteric colibacillosis and cryptococcidiosis, and the level of animal husbandry and clinical management provided in the herd. A study of outbreaks of diarrhoea on 9 dairy farms in Gippsland in 1981 showed that rotavirus was present in 6% of normal calves and in 49% of calves with diarrhoea (Jerret 1985). Cryptosporidia spp was present in 36% of the diarrhoeic calves, Salmonella spp was present in 12% and K99 E. coli present in 5%. More than one pathogen was present in 19% of the affected calves.",
