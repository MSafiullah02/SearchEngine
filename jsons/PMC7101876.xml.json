Her chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse opacification throughout both lungs compatible with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was treated with cefuroxime, clarithromycin and metronidazole. As she failed to improve, a bronchoscopy was performed, demonstrating necrotising granulomata; bronchial washings were obtained. A chest high-resolution computerised tomograph (HRCT) demonstrated appearances compatible with miliary tuberculosis (Fig. 1). As a consequence, and due to the continuing ill health of the infant, gastric aspirates were sent from the infant. Acid fast bacilli were seen on microscopy. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from the gastric aspirate and bronchial washings from his mother. Both strains had identical drug sensitivities and were indistinguishable on variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis. VNTR analysis determines the number of tandem repeats at multiple independent loci in the genome of M. tuberculosis. Tuberculin testing of the infant was negative and ultrasound examination of his liver did not show any granulomatous lesions. Screening of the mother\u2019s breast milk for acid fast bacilli was negative and placenta biopsies did not reveal any granulomatous lesions or acid fast bacilli. The immediate family were screened and none had tuberculosis. At the time of diagnosis, the infant\u2019s weight was 1.87 kg. The infant was started on isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Nasogastric feeds were reintroduced without further problems.\n\n",

Non-specific symptoms, including poor feeding and abdominal distension, can occur [2], as suffered by our infant. The infant was tuberculin skin testing negative but in connatal infection, this test is initially negative and can take up to three months to become positive [4]. The culture of endotracheal aspirate or gastric aspirate is often diagnostic. Nucleic acid amplification by polymerase chain reaction, however, provides more rapid diagnosis.",

The incidence of TB, however, is increasing in women of child-bearing age [4], particularly in those of ethnic minority groups and recent immigrants, especially if infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Early diagnosis of connatal TB is difficult because the symptoms are often non-specific. However, if left untreated, the outcome is always poor. The case we describe highlights that neonatal practitioners should consider connatal TB as a differential diagnosis of a prematurely born infant poorly responsive to standard management and whose mother is in a high-risk group.",
