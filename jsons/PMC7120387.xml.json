            "text": "The drastic rise in the number of publications on compounds from fungal endophytes within the past two decades is due to the creative ability of these fungi to produce secondary metabolites. There is also a rise in the need for new antibiotics, anti-malarial drugs, chemotherapeutic or pharmaceutical agents that are highly effective, possess low toxicity and have a minor environmental impact. The development of resistance in infectious microorganisms like Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium and Streptococcus to existing drugs and the presence of naturally resistant organisms are causing threat to mankind (Mwangi et al. 2007; Hugonnet et al. 2009; Richter et al. 2009). Emerging diseases such as AIDS, SARS and NDM-1 necessitate the discovery and development of new drugs (Kumarasamy et al. 2010). The weakened immune system due to AIDS not only requires specific drugs for treatment but also needs new therapies to combat the secondary problems arisen from it, and, furthermore, the HI virus is developing resistance towards the existing drugs (Richman et al. 2004). Opportunistic pathogens such as Aspergillus, Cryptococcus and Candida are also virulent in immunocompromised patients, and in patients, who need an organ transplant. In addition, parasitic protozoan and nematodal infections such as malaria, leishmaniasis, trypanomiasis and filariasis are causing major problems in many countries and effective drugs against them are needed. Malaria is claiming more lives each year than diseases caused by any other infectious agent, with the exception of AIDS and TB (NIAID Global Health Research Plan for HIV/AIDS 2001), and enteric infections claim more lives of children each year than any other disease (Strobel et al. 2004).",

Exciting possibilities exist for those who are willing to take a risk and venture into the unexplored territories of the world to experience the excitement and thrill of engaging in the discovery of endophytes, their biology and potential usefulness (Strobel 2003). In the past decade, endophytic microbes have attracted considerable attention as completely new sources of novel pharmaceuticals (Strobel 2002).",

From the screening of a huge number of microbial extracts, an unexpected diversity of natural compounds with a broad variety of biological activities has been found (Grabley and Sattler 2003). Therefore, microorganisms associated with plants, rather than the plants themselves, can be raw material with promising therapeutic potential (Strobel 2002). Until now, endophytic microbial metabolites have been studied for a wide range of activities like antioomycete, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancerous and immunosuppressive activities. Endophytes were given considerable credibility as sources of novel compounds through the discovery of Taxol\u00ae biosynthesis, and a variety of other antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer metabolites from the endophytic fungi Taxomyces andreae and Pestalotiopsis spp. (Stierle et al. 1993; Strobel 2003). Endophytes can be used as sources of novel metabolites for medicine, agriculture and industrial uses. The best strategy for finding new bioactive compounds is to survey endophytes from plants restricted to special areas, as a means to isolate fungi that likely were never studied in earlier screening programs (Pelaez et al. 1998).",

The potential of endophytic fungi as a source of novel drugs can be seen in terms of number of patents filed and granted on endophytes.

Plants have been utilized to produce various types of medicines for thousands of years (Samuelsson 2004). These medicines were initially used in the form of crude drugs such as tinctures, teas, poultices, powders and other herbal formulations (Balick and Cox 1997; Samuelsson 2004). More than 50,000 medicinal plants (Schippmann et al.\n2002) out of the total of 4, 22,000 flowering plants reported worldwide have been used for various medicinal purposes (Govaerts 2001). The information on the plants usable for these purposes, and the methods of applying them for a particular ailment, were passed down orally through successive generations. Eventually the information on medicinal plants was recorded in herbals. More recently, the use of plants as medicines has focused on the isolation of active compounds, for example the isolation of morphine from opium poppy in the early nineteenth century (Kinghorn 2001; Samuelsson 2004). According to the World Health Organization (WHO 1991), 80% of the world\u2019s population is dependent on health-care provided by medicinal plants.",

Endophytic fungi may influence other fungi present in the same host, existing between the tropical niches of pathogen and mutualist (Hoff et al. 2004). This influence can be expressed directly by inhibition or stimulation of fungal growth, or indirectly via effects on host physiology and morphology. Thus, the genetic variability and unpredictability of pathogen interactions with the host plants can be attributed to endophytes (Saikkonen et al.\n1998; Hoff et al. 2004).",

The majority of the isolates belonged to ubiquitous genera (e.g. Acremonium, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Coniothyrium, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Geniculosporium, Pestalotiopsis, Phoma, Pleospora), concurring with previous results, reviewed by Petrini (1986), that many endophytes are from ubiquitous taxa. The assemblages of endophytes vary with habitat, as different ubiquitous genera are isolated from tropical than from temperate climates (e.g. see the chapters by M. Unterseher and T.S. Suryanarayanan, this volume). Some genera like Fusarium, Phomopsis and Phoma are common in both tropical and temperate climates, whereas members of Xylariaceae, Colletotrichum, Guignardia, Phyllosticta and Pestalotiopsis predominate in the tropics (Frohlich and Hyde 1999; Cannon and Simmons 2002; Suryanarayanan et al. 2003; Arnold 2008). An interesting aspect to investigate is how the occupation of an inter- or intracellular niche within a plant by one fungal group affects the subsequent establishment and evolution of other fungal partnerships (Schulz and Boyle 2005).",

A group of Pestalotiopsis species produces secondary metabolites, which have great potential as antioxidants, antimicrobials and anti-tumor compounds (Tan and Zou 2001; Zhang et al.\n2006; Xu et al. 2010). However, many endophytic Pestalotiopsis species have been unidentified due to the limitation and difficulty in applying classification based on existing morphological characters (Okane et al.\n1998; Suryanarayanan and Kumaresan 2000; Suryanarayanan et al.\n1998; Toofanee and Dulymamode 2002; Tejesvi et al. 2009). There are >140 metabolites that have been identified and characterized from Pestalotiopsis spp., belonging to different classes of compounds such as alkaloids, terpenoids, isocoumarin derivatives, coumarins, chromones, quinones, semiquinones, peptides, xanthones, xanthone derivatives, phenols, phenolic acids, and lactones (Fig. 2), of which some examples with antimicrobial activity are given in the following paragraph.\n",

Various biosynthetic pathways can be optimized by changing the culture conditions for effective development and discovery of the lead compounds.

            "text": "Developing a productive microbial source for anti-infectives and immunosuppressants not only would lower the production cost of the compound but would also make it widely available. The sources of new drugs during the period from 1981 to 2006 indicate that over 60% of the drugs are natural products, and close to 70% of anti-infectives and 63% of anticancerous drugs are derived from natural products (Cragg and Newman 2009). However, even though endophytic fungi show great potential as sources for industry-scale production of Taxol\u00ae, so far they have not been applied to industrial use (Ji et al. 2006). Problems such as low fungal biomass produced during fermentation, low yield of Taxol\u00ae in culture and lack of knowledge of regulation of the biosynthesis pathway limit the industrial use of these fungi (Ji et al. 2006). A yield of 1 mg/l for Taxol\u00ae production would be profitable at industrial scale, but the highest yields reported so far are 15 to 20 times lower (Deng et al. 2009). Taxol\u00ae has become a successful natural compound that is widely used as anti-tumor agent, with a higher demand than production rates. Therefore, knowledge of biotechnological tools for large-scale production of Taxol\u00ae are needed to engineer endophytic strains, or to produce Taxol\u00ae in heterologous hosts.",

It is feasible to produce and isolate mutants that could readily be cultivated or could generate either additional products or modified products with a higher therapeutic index (Piepersberg 1994). Moreover, the metabolites they produce are largely generated by enzymatic pathways that have the potential to biosynthetically link existing structures to chemical adjuncts in a reproducible manner, at yields that are acceptable for industrial scale (Verdine 1996). To improve Taxol\u00ae production, one strain of Nodulisporium sylviform, has been subjected to mutagenesis and production of 314\u2013393 \u03bcg/L was obtained (Zhao et al. 2005; Zhou et al. 2005). Another way to modify the fungal secondary metabolome is to alter their epigenetic status (Williams et al. 2008). By treating bioactive fungi with enzymes such as DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylase inhibitors, enhanced chemical diversity can be obtained (Williams et al. 2008). In this sense, natural products produced from microbes exhibit a number of properties that make them excellent candidates for industrial processes.",

The culture independent analysis techniques such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) (Nikolcheva and B\u00e4rlocher 2005), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (Duong et al. 2006), or direct sequencing of ribosomal sequences (Seena et al.\n2008; Tejesvi et al. 2010) are generally used for analyzing the diversity of unculturable fungal communities in plants.

            "text": "Another reasonably new and highly innovative approach is the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in heterologous hosts. Heterologous expression of biosynthesis pathway of a compound through the transfer of the pathway genes from the producer organism to another, foreign host, can enable the production of the compound in higher quantities (Wenzel and Muller 2005). Escherichia coli is a widely used host for expression of even complex metabolic pathways, such as that of erythromycin (Pfeifer et al. 2001), echinomycin and triostin A (Watanabe 2008). Other hosts used recently are e.g. Myxococcus xanthus and Pseudomonas putida for the production of epothilone or myxochromide S (Fu et al. 2008), the thermopilic isolate Corallococcus macrosporus GT-2 for the production of myxochromide (Perlova et al. 2009) and Streptomyces lividans for the production of meridamycin (Liu et al. 2009c). An engineered Streptomyces avermitilis mutant was developed very recently and used for the heterologous expression of three different biosynthesis pathways, streptomycin, cephamycin C and pladienolide. Another Streptomyces mutant was optimized for terpenoid production by introduction of a synthetic gene optimized for Streptomyces codon usage, and this mutant was capable of producing the plant terpenoid intermediate, amorpha-4,11-diene (Komatsua et al. 2010). With respect to Taxol, already in 2001 Huang et al. accomplished in vivo production of the intermediate taxadiene in E. coli, and taxadiene and taxadien-5a-ol were produced in yeast by Engels et al. in 2008. As for now, the production of Taxol itself in a heterologous host remains to be fulfilled. Yeast might be a promising host for such attempts, as the plant-derived artemisin has been successfully produced in yeast (Ro et al. 2006). However, there is an on-going debate on the host selection between E. coli and yeast for the heterologous production of plant- and fungi-derived compounds. Although yeast might appear more suitable, there is a conflict of the yeast metabolism interacting with, and/or contaminating the expression of the heterologously introduced pathway (Zhang et al. 2011). Another host that could become useful for the heterologous expression of endophytic products is Aspergillus nidulans. This host has been tested and used, e.g. for the heterologous production of Monacolin J (a lovastatin intermediate) (Zirkle et al. 2004). As these methodologies develop further, and access to the genome data of endophytic fungi by pyrosequencing becomes available, further and most promising developments within this arena can be expected.",

The drug development cycle from laboratory to market is long-lasting with the different phases involved, starting from drug discovery (for example, 10,000 compounds), preclinical trials (about 1\u20132% of the molecules), human clinical trials (2\u20135% of the molecules), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) review, FDA or EMEA approval and post-market clinical trials (Fig. 5). At the moment, the success rate for anti-infective molecules is about 16% for those approved between 1993 and 2004 (DiMasi et al. 2010) and the time to reach the markets varies between 10 and 12 years, depending on the drug. Because antimicrobials have a short-lived nature as drugs, as they normally are taken only for short periods of time and easily develop resistance, the resulting low profit expectancy and, subsequently, a low interest by pharmaceutical companies complicate the efforts of developing completely new drug compounds (Bradley et al. 2007). The pharmaceutical industry is therefore preferably investing in anti-inflammatory, ACE inhibitors, diabetes and anti-cancerous drugs, which are known to generate long-term revenue. Even though pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are testing increasing numbers of compounds against various targets by high-throughput screening technologies, the question regarding drug development is whether the products can reach the markets in time for procurement of the disease. Regardless, or due to these problems, the efforts to look for safe, novel compounds from the nature should be persistent and continuous.\n",

The fermentation and high-throughput screening of a wide array of secondary metabolites with bioassay-guided fraction can yield various new metabolites for various therapeutic targets in the future. The new biotechnological tools have great promise in enabling the industrial use of endophytic fungi and their products. There is a continuous need for international co-operation to identify and develop antimicrobial drugs to combat various infectious diseases.",
