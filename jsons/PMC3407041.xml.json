The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protein Nef enables evasion of cellular adaptive immunity by antagonizing the antiviral activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes1. These cells recognize viral peptides displayed on the cell surface by MHC-I and limit viral replication by killing the infected cells. Nef antagonizes cytotoxic T cells by decreasing surface expression of MHC-I, thereby reducing viral antigen presentation on infected cells1,2. Nef has a critical role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection3: defective nef genes are associated with substantially delayed progression to AIDS4,5.",

Adaptor protein complexes are a family of heterotetramers that recognize cytoplasmic sorting motifs in transmembrane proteins and package them into clathrin-coated vesicles for intracellular transport11,12. AP1 transports transmembrane proteins between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. Nef co-opts this pathway to retain MHC-I in the trans-Golgi network before diverting it to lysosomes for degradation7,13. Sequences recognized by adaptor protein complexes include the tyrosine-based Yxx\u03c6 motif (\u03c6, bulky hydrophobic residue; x, any amino acid) and the leucine-based [ED]xxxL[LI] motif (bracketed residues represent alternative choices at the position). Yxx\u03c6 sequences bind the medium-sized (\u03bc) subunit of adaptor protein complexes at a well-defined binding pocket14. A tyrosine in MHC-I CD and the tyrosine-binding pocket in the \u03bc1 subunit are critical for modulation of MHC-I by Nef6,7,8,9,10. However, the context of this tyrosine, 320-YSQA-323, lacks a hydrophobic residue at the Y+3 position, rendering the sequence intrinsically inactive as an adaptor protein\u2013binding signal. Nef has the crucial role of enabling AP1 to recognize and bind the MHC-I CD.",

Structural studies on Nef and its interaction complex with Src-family kinases15 show that Nef comprises a folded core domain and two long, flexible loops, one at the N terminus (residues 24\u201368) and one near the C terminus (residues 148\u2013178)15,16,17,18. The regions of Nef important for MHC-I downregulation include an N-terminal \u03b1-helix, an acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65), a (PxxP)3 repeat at the junction of the N-terminal loop and the folded core, and residue Asp123 (refs. 19,20). The acidic dileucine motif in the C-terminal loop is not required for downregulation of MHC-I, although it is crucial for binding of Nef to AP2 and downregulation of CD4, the cellular receptor for the virus7,8,9,10,19,21. Despite this progress, most Nef-binding events are incompletely characterized. In particular, little is known about the formation of the Nef\u2013MHC-I\u2013AP1 complex at the structural level.",

The membrane-proximal end of MHC-I CD forms an extended strand that augments the \u03bc1 \u03b2-sheets at the side of the cargo recognition site, with Tyr320 of the MHC-I CD in the tyrosine-binding pocket of \u03bc1.

Nef is further affixed to \u03bc1 by extensive contacts at the core domain and by crucial electrostatic interactions involving its acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65). The C terminus of Nef, together with a region of \u03bc1 that is disordered in an earlier structure22, forms a snug pocket at one end of the binding groove to cradle a tight turn of the MHC-I CD (residues 327\u2013332; Fig. 1c).

The C-terminal domain of \u03bc1 (residues 158\u2013423) remains as a banana-shaped structure of mostly \u03b2-strands22, with a slight twist (~10\u00b0) along its long axis upon formation of complex (Supplementary Fig. 1). An unstructured region of \u03bc1 (residues 218\u2013231) becomes ordered to interact with both Nef and the MHC-I CD. The core domain of Nef has the same structure as seen earlier, whereas the functionally important acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65) and the PxxP repeats (residues 68\u201378) swing to a different trajectory to interact with \u03bc1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The N-terminal helix of Nef is observed for the first time to be attached to the protein's core, on the side opposite the MHC-I-binding site (Fig. 1). Much of the Nef N- and C-terminal loops (residues 27\u201356 and 162\u2013174, respectively) are disordered and not seen in the structure. In addition, the connecting region of the MHC-I CD\u2013Nef fusion protein, including the last nine residues of MHC-I, a two-residue linker (TS) and the first four residues of Nef, is also disordered. This flexible region of 15 residues can span up to 55 \u00c5 in distance, whereas its two ends observed in the structure are only 28 \u00c5 apart, suggesting that the fusion linker probably does not cause distortion of the structure.",

The largest binary interface, 1,058 \u00c52, occurs between Nef and \u03bc1 and falls into the category of weak, transient binding24. The MHC-I\u2013\u03bc1 and MHC-I\u2013Nef interfaces bury 771 \u00c52 and 437 \u00c52, respectively, predicting that no binary complexes would form with MHC-I. In contrast, all three components together generate a total of 2,266 \u00c52 buried area in a strong three-protein complex. This analysis also suggests a possible sequence of binding events. The association between Nef and AP1 may take place first, as their buried surface area predicts the only probable binary binding event. The binding groove would then be created at the Nef-\u03bc1 interface to sequester the MHC-I CD. Consistent with this scenario, we found that the Nef-\u03bc1 binary complex can form at high protein concentrations (~30 \u03bcM; Supplementary Fig. 2), although this interaction is not strong enough to be detected by in vitro pull-down assay10. This is corroborated by the weak, binary interaction between Nef and \u03bc1 (refs. 6,25). Moreover, the binding of Nef to \u03bc1 is enhanced by the presence of the MHC-I CD7,10; this further supports the cooperative nature of the three-protein interaction.",

The binding geometry closely resembles that of the Yxx\u03c6 peptide binding to \u03bc2 of AP2 (Fig. 2a)14. However, the lack of a bulky hydrophobic side chain at the Y+3 position (Fig. 2b) in the MHC-I CD (320-YSQA-323) leads to an empty hydrophobic pocket on \u03bc1 (Fig. 2c); this explains why MHC-I is not recognized by AP1 in the absence of Nef.

These interactions shape one end of the binding groove and provide a second anchoring point at Asp327, in addition to Tyr320, for the MHC-I CD to latch into the groove. The D327A mutation in MHC-I or D123G in HIV-1 Nef abolishes downregulation of MHC-I9,26,29. However, in contrast with the proposed role of Asp123 in Nef dimerization29, the crystal structure shows that this residue is essential because of the three-way electrostatic interaction. Moreover, the R225A R393A double mutation in \u03bc1 abolished binding with the MHC I\u2013CD\u2013Nef fusion protein in vitro (Fig. 3c), as predicted from the structure.",

This helix, as part of the flexible N terminus of Nef, has been predicted to be detached from the core32. It is nonetheless important, as deletion of part of it, or mutation of Met20 within it, abolishes Nef-mediated downregulation of MHC-I9,20,26. Our structure shows that the helix instead is anchored via two hydrophobic residues, Trp13 and Met20, to the surface of the Nef core opposite the MHC-I binding site. Rather than directly participating in intermolecular binding, the N-terminal helix\u2013core association is predicted to bring the Nef core close to the membrane, facilitating interaction with the MHC-I CD and the AP1 complex. Consistent with an important helix-core anchoring interaction, either W13A or M20A mutation in Nef abolished downregulation of MHC-I in human T lymphocytes (Fig. 4b). Mutations of the two residues also inhibited complex formation in our in vitro pull-down assays (Fig. 4c).

In the region corresponding to the Nef-induced \u03bc1 helix-turn structure, a much longer loop exists in \u03bc2, which probably does not adopt the same conformation (Supplementary Fig. 4). \u03bc2 also lacks the important tyrosine residue (Tyr374 in \u03bc1) that stacks onto Nef Pro72 to stabilize the sharp Nef turn (Figs. 2 and 5). Furthermore, \u03bc2 does not have the essential basic patch that attracts the Nef acidic cluster to secure formation of complex. Indeed, the Nef-MHC-I CD construct did not interact with \u03bc2 in our in vitro pull-down experiments (Fig. 5c). These differences highlight an important distinction between the two otherwise highly homologous \u03bc subunits in AP1 and AP2, which may contribute to different interactions with distinct cellular sorting proteins and cargos. The lack of interaction between Nef and \u03bc2 also could explain why Nef uses a distinct mode of interaction\u2014involving its acidic dileucine motif and the \u03b1 and \u03c32 subunits of AP2\u2014to downregulate CD4 (refs. 33,34).",

There is a striking coplanar arrangement of the Nef N-terminal myristoylation site, the MHC-I CD membrane-proximal end and multiple phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding sites on AP2 (ref. 35), consistent with formation of complex along the lipid bilayer in vivo. The coplanar arrangement of all the membrane attachment sites indicates that this model is likely to be accurate. Through myristoylation and anchoring of its N-terminal helix to the core, Nef is positioned at an optimal distance from the lipid membrane to bind the AP1 complex; this probably occurs after recruitment of AP1 to the membrane by the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (refs. 36,37). The Nef-\u03bc1 interaction may also contribute to inducing the active, open conformation of AP1 through electrostatic attractions resembling those involving the PIP2-containing membranes35. This interaction probably further stabilizes the membrane association of AP1, as we have reported earlier38. The association of Nef and AP1 then creates a snug binding groove for recruitment of the MHC-I CD and ultimately leads to packaging of MHC-I into the clathrin-coated vesicle.",

            "text": "Nef uses a wide range of structural features throughout its length to hijack the AP-1 complex and modulate cell surface expression of MHC-I. Perhaps owing to its highly cooperative nature, the interaction is very delicate: mutation of any of its key elements disrupts the complex and causes loss of Nef activity. This explains the observation that virtually every domain in Nef required for modulation of MHC-I is also required for coimmunoprecipitation of the two proteins from human cells26. Moreover, our model explains why the dileucine motif in the C terminus of native Nef is not active during downregulation of MHC-I, yet is functional as a trafficking signal when Nef is fused to the CD of MHC-I39. Our structure shows that the cooperative Nef\u2013MHC-I CD\u2013\u03bc1 ternary interaction is key to recruitment of MHC-I to AP1. This conformation, however, precludes the involvement of the dileucine motif of Nef, as the binding site for [ED]xxxL[LI] motifs on the \u03b3 and \u03c31 subunits of AP1 (ref. 40) is too distant (Fig. 6). In contrast, when MHC-I is covalently linked to Nef, the critical MHC-I recruitment step is bypassed, and any trafficking signal in Nef, including the dileucine motif, can contribute to trafficking of the MHC-I\u2013Nef fusion protein. Nevertheless, the principle of cooperative binding probably also applies to the mechanism by which Nef modulates CD4 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and AP2 (ref. 41), even though that interaction involves the dileucine motif of Nef and the \u03b1 and \u03c32 subunits of AP2 rather than \u03bc2.",

            "text": "Our structure supports the notion that Nef is a virally encoded clathrin-associated sorting protein (CLASP) that alters the breadth and specificity of cargo recognition by adaptor protein complexes12. The cooperative binding mechanism by which Nef enables an adaptor protein complex to recognize a suboptimal sorting sequence could be used by cellular CLASPs. For example, in mouse MHC-I, the tyrosine residue corresponding to Tyr320 is required for 'cross-presentation' of exogenous antigens by dendritic cells, an event required for priming of antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes42. This observation, together with the role of Tyr320 in Nef-mediated modulation of MHC-I via AP1, has led us and others to speculate that cross-presentation might involve AP-1 and a cellular CLASP that is reminiscent of HIV-1 Nef8,9. Moreover, the positively charged clusters on \u03bc1 that contribute to the interaction between Nef and the MHC-I CD may function as binding sites for the acidic trafficking motifs of cellular proteins. For example, the cytoplasmic domain of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor contains acidic clusters that include glutamic acid, aspartic acid and phosphoserine residues, and these sequences contribute to interaction with AP1 (ref. 43).",

Nef-mediated downregulation of MHC-I A2 (or related mutants) was measured by flow cytometric analysis of CD4+ T cells of the CEM line, which express MHC-A1, with or without constitutive expression of Nef; cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the \u03b1-chain of MHC-I A2. For transient expression experiments, 4 \u00d7 106 CEM cells per sample were transfected using Amaxa program X-001 or 3 \u00d7 106 SupT1 cells per sample were transfected using program O-017. All cellular samples were washed in medium without antibiotics and then resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of Amaxa Kit V nucleofection reagent (Lonza). For the SupT1 cells, the plasmid DNA was 2 \u03bcg pCG-GFP (a gift from J. Skowronski, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA) plus 20 \u03bcg pCI-Neo (Promega) encoding Nef or the indicated Nef-mutants.

After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h, the cells were surface stained while alive for HLA-A2, and the cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using a goat antiserum to HIV-1 Nef (a gift from C. Spina, UCSD). For the flow cytometry, each sample was resuspended in 100 \u03bcl PBS and stained using 10 \u03bcg ml\u22121 MA2.1 (a murine monoclonal antibody to HLA-A2, a gift from D.
