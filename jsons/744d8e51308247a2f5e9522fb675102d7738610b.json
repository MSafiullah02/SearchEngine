Full clinical details, which included obtainment of a clinical history and a physical examination, were performed by one of the study staff members. The method used for obtaining and processing the NPA samples has been described elsewhere [10] . All samples were evaluated for common respiratory viruses, including RSV, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1-3, and adenovirus, using a direct immunofluorescence assay (Respiratory Panel 1 Viral Screening and Identification Kit; Chemicon International). Of a total of 824 samples (326 obtained from HIV-1-infected infants, 486 obtained from HIV-1-uninfected infants, and 12 obtained from infants with unknown HIV-1 infection status), 196 samples were randomly selected and were stratified by HIV-1 infection status. These 824 samples were in addition to 454 samples (75, 367, and 12 obtained from HIV-1-infected infants, HIV-1-uninfected infants, and infants with unknown HIV-1 infection status, respectively) from which \u04431 of the studied common respiratory viruses was identified. The HIV-1 infection status of the infants was determined using HIV-1 ELISAs (Axsym [Abbott] and Murex HIV 1+2 [Murex Diagnostics]) and confirmed using an HIV-1 PCR assay (HIV-1 DNA PCR, version 1.5; Roche Amplicor).",

We chose to limit the number of samples tested, as well as the period of time from which samples were selected for testing, because of the limited resources available to conduct this preliminary study, which aimed to document whether hMPV was an important pathogen among infants who are traditionally most at risk of being hospitalized for LRTI. Furthermore, we chose not to evaluate specimens that had tested positive for any of the other common respiratory viruses on the basis of the low frequency of dual-virus coinfections with hMPV and other viruses (0%-2%) observed in all but one of the other studies [1, 2, 4, 8] . The samples used were obtained during March through July, which is period when previous RSV epidemics had been described to occur in the community [11] , as well as 2 months thereafter (August and September-i.e., early spring), to reflect the possibility that the seasonality of hMPV epidemics follows that of RSV epidemics.",

The relatively lower prevalence of hMPV among HIV-1-infected infants, compared with HIV-1-uninfected infants, was most likely related to the greater importance of other respiratory pathogens among HIV-1-infected infants, including bacteria (\u044315% of cases) and P. jiroveci (\u223c45% of cases) [9, 15] . In a previous study, we showed that, despite RSV (5.3% vs. 18.1%), influenza virus (5.4% vs. 11.8%), and parainfluenza viruses (4.2% vs. 7.9%) being proportionally less commonly isolated among HIV-1-infected infants than among HIV-1-uninfected infants who had been hospitalized for severe LRTI, the relative risk of hospitalization for LRTI associated with these viruses was \u223c2-8-fold greater among HIV-1-infected infants [10] . The design of this study was suboptimal to estimate the relative risk of hospitalization for hMPV-associated LRTI between HIV-1infected and HIV-1-uninfected infants. Nevertheless, on the basis of the estimate that the prevalence of HIV-1 infection in the study cohort was \u223c6% [16] , it was extrapolated that, like other common respiratory viruses [10] , hMPV was isolated from a lower proportion of HIV-1-infected infants hospitalized for LRTI. The population risk of hospitalization for hMPVassociated LRTI was, however, 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.6-5.1-fold) greater among HIV-1-infected infants than among HIV-1uninfected infants, as determined on the basis of calculation methods described elsewhere [10] .",

Furthermore, none of the samples that had tested positive for other respiratory viruses were further tested for hMPV. This may have resulted in a lowering of the relative importance of hMPV in relation to the other viruses. Samples were also not evaluated for other potential respiratory viral pathogens, such as rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus. Concurrent viral infections have been reported among 2 (16.7%) of 12 children with hMPVassociated acute respiratory tract infections, as well as among 70% of children requiring mechanical ventilation for RSVassociated bronchiolitis [8, 17] .

            "text": "Furthermore, the yield of hMPV-positive samples in our study may be low, because samples in our study were evaluated directly for hMPV by PCR without culture being performed [1, 2] . Therefore, we may have underestimated the importance of hMPV among African infants. A recent study using the same PCR technique as was used in our study, however, suggested that, on its own, RT-PCR may be adequate for identification of hMPV, even in the absence of viral culture [17] . Although an additional limitation of our study was the absence of a control group of healthy infants to exclude isolation of hMPV as coincidental in the studied infants, a more recent study [17] (in addition to the earliest report on hMPV [1] ) has shown that hMPV infection/colonization is absent among infants without respiratory symptoms. With regard to the clinical spectrum of disease observed among infants in this study, it is interesting that 4 (36.4%) of 11 infants had alveolar consolidation visible on their chest radiographs, as determined on the basis of the World Health Organization's standardized criteria for assessment of chest radiographs [18] . Furthermore, 4 (28.6%) of 14 infants had an axillary temperature of \u044337.5\u040aC at the time of presentation, and 4 (66.7%) of the 6 infants examined had C-reactive protein levels of \u044340 mg/dL. In the absence of any bacterial growth on blood cultures, these findings suggest either that hMPV may be associated with a severe inflammatory response, including extensive lung parenchymal involvement, or that there may have been concurrent, unrecognized bacterial coinfections in these infants that may have contributed to the radiological and laboratory features that were observed. However, the findings in our study are in contrast with those in a study from Hong Kong, where the majority of children with hMPV infection were pyrexial (mean temperature, 39.2\u040aC), and none had lobar consolidation visible on chest radiographs [5] . However, the children with hMPV infection in the Hong Kong study were much older (mean age, 31.7 months) than were those in our study [5] . The C-reactive protein levels and WBC counts ob-served among selected infants in our study also differed from those observed among Finnish children, in whom the mean Creactive protein level was 9 mg/L and the mean WBC count was cells/L [7] . This difference in C-reactive protein 9 9.5 \u03eb 10 levels and WBC counts in our study may have been because these values were determined mainly in infants with severe disease, as evidenced by the longer duration of hospitalization among the infants for whom these measurements were made; in the Finland study, these tests were performed for children with clinically milder disease [7] . However, the duration of hospitalization in our study (median, 2.0 days) was similar to that observed among Finnish children ( , 2.5 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 1.6 mean \u202b\u05e2\u202c SD days) [7] .",

Therefore, additional studies are warranted to clarify the importance of the identified risk factors as underlying conditions for severe RSV disease among infants. Although it was not significant, the finding of longer durations of hospital stay among infants with underlying medical conditions is a signal indicating greater severity of hMPV-associated LRTI amongst these infants.",
