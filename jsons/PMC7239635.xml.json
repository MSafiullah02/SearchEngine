If identified contacts are symptomatic when found, they are promptly isolated and treated in a health-care setting. More often, contacts are found healthy, and may not be infected. Depending on how much time has passed since exposure to the primary infected individual, those infected individuals may not yet be symptomatic\u2014this period of time between infection and symptoms is an important epidemiological trait of an infectious disease called the incubation period. How to handle these symptom-free contacts is a recurring point of confusion and controversy, particularly for emerging infectious diseases. Two essential strategies are used: individual quarantine or active monitoring of individuals. Individual quarantine involves the separation from others of an individual who is believed to be exposed to the disease but not currently showing symptoms of it; this intervention requires private space, provision of essentials, and investment in enforcement. A less restrictive intervention, active monitoring, involves assessing the individual for symptoms at regular intervals such as twice-daily visits by health-care workers or phone-based self-monitoring,3 and if symptoms are detected, the individual is promptly isolated.",

Previous research found that a disease's natural history, particularly the amount of transmission that occurs before symptom onset, greatly affects the ability to control outbreaks and the relative effectiveness of these two strategies. We searched PubMed and medRxiv for the terms \u201cindividual quarantine\u201d, \u201cactive monitoring\u201d, \u201ccontact tracing\u201d, \u201cCOVID19\u201d, and \u201cnCoV\u201d up to March 24, 2020, with no date or language restrictions. We identified several studies reporting estimates of epidemiological parameters of COVID-19, as well as others focused on measures to control the COVID-19 outbreak. However, few focused specifically on contact-based measures. A study on isolation for COVID-19 control found a potentially large effect of perfect isolation, although quarantine before symptom onset was outside the scope. However, estimates for the serial interval of COVID-19, which affects the amount of presymptomatic transmission, are varied.\nAdded value of this study\nAs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread, better understanding of how to contain it becomes crucial. In this study, we used methods described in our previous work and disease-specific epidemiological parameters reported for COVID-19 to compare the ability of individual quarantine and active monitoring to reduce the effective reproductive number of COVID-19 to below the crucial threshold of 1. We provide an estimate of presymptomatic transmission specifically for COVID-19, a key parameter for understanding outbreak dynamics. We further develop a metric for the feasibility of scaling up active monitoring and individual quarantine and examine the synergistic effect of contact-tracing interventions with physical distancing, which can guide public health responses to this pandemic.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nAssuming a mean serial interval of 4\u00b78 days, as reported in a previous study, the incremental benefit of individual quarantine over active monitoring was substantial as a result of the shorter time from infection to onward transmission and more presymptomatic transmission. However, using a mean serial interval of 7\u00b75 days, as reported for the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, individual quarantine and active monitoring are similarly effective at controlling onward transmission in a high-feasibility setting. The burden of placing uninfected contacts under individual quarantine can grow untenable due to a longer duration in quarantine before clearance (assumed 14 days) and a higher ratio of uninfected contacts traced per truly infected contact. In such settings, resources might be prioritised for broader physical distancing measures, and active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts could contribute synergistically. The sensitivity of these results to the estimated serial interval highlights the urgent need for better data to guide policy decisions.\n",

Previous work has found that a disease's natural history, particularly the amount of transmission that occurs before symptom onset, greatly affects the ability to control outbreaks4 and the relative effectiveness of individual quarantine versus active monitoring.5 Short-course diseases such as influenza, and diseases with long periods of presymptomatic infectiousness such as hepatitis A, are affected more strongly by quarantine than by active monitoring. However, quarantine is of limited benefit over active monitoring for the coronaviruses causing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), where people usually show distinctive symptoms at or near the same time that they become infectious. Hellewell and colleagues6 found a potentially large effect of perfect isolation on COVID-19, although quarantine before symptom onset was outside the scope. A mobile phone application for contact tracing could allow for instant contact tracing, decreasing the time to isolation of symptomatic contacts.7 Our framework enables comparison of active monitoring with individual quarantine and considers parameters such as delays and imperfect isolation to account for known transmission of this respiratory virus after isolation in a health-care setting.8\n",

            "text": "One of the key uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 is the extent of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission. A study reporting asymptomatic transmission in Germany9 was later found to be incorrect or misleading,10 adding to the confusion. There has also been uncertainty about the serial interval\u2014the time between symptom onset of infector\u2013infectee pairs\u2014which in turn reflects uncertainty about the extent of presymptomatic transmission. Early estimates by Nishiura and colleagues11 (of 24 infector\u2013infectee pairs) and Li and colleagues12 (of six infector\u2013infectee pairs) were derived from limited data, and the estimates by Li and colleagues12 reflected the distribution of the serial interval derived from SARS cases in 2003. Given the severe impact of quarantine on both resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions quarantine can effectively control COVID-19, and among these, under what conditions quarantine is substantially more effective than less restrictive approaches such as active monitoring, particularly given uncertainty in essential disease parameters. In this study, we used methods described in our previous work5 and disease-specific epidemiological parameters reported for COVID-1911, 12 to compare the ability of individual quarantine and active monitoring to reduce the effective reproductive number (R\ne) of COVID-19 to below the crucial threshold of 1. Although mass restrictions on movements within cities have been implemented during this outbreak and are sometimes referred to as quarantines, here we focus on the effectiveness of quarantine and active monitoring on an individual basis based on contact tracing.",

A high-feasibility setting, presented as the main results, is defined as one where 90% of contacts are traced and put under either quarantine or active monitoring within an average of 0\u00b75 days (range 0\u20131). Contacts under active monitoring are monitored every 0\u00b75 days on average (range 0\u20131). A contact under individual quarantine has infectiousness reduced by 75% (\u03b3q=0\u00b775) until symptoms emerge and prompt isolation. When symptoms emerge in a contact under quarantine or active monitoring, they are isolated in a setting that reduces infectiousness by 90% (\u03b3i=0\u00b790), thereby greatly reducing but not eliminating infectiousness while isolated. Assuming perfect intervention performance is not possible, the high-feasibility parameters represent upper bounds of the expected ability to implement interventions based on contact tracing, and are reflected by multiple national contact investigation guidelines for COVID-19, including contact tracing within 24 h and twice-daily monitoring for symptoms.1, 14, 15 A low-feasibility setting loosens these assumptions to account for imperfect recall of who may be exposed (P\nCT=50%), delays in identifying or locating contacts (D\nCT=2 days [range 0\u20134]), infrequent or untrained monitoring of symptoms (D\nSM=2 days [range 0\u20134]), and imperfect quarantine (\u03b3q=0\u00b725) and isolation (\u03b3i=0\u00b75).",

Under our fitted disease natural history parameters for serial interval scenario 1, with a short mean serial interval of 4\u00b78 days and hence substantial presymptomatic infectiousness, individual quarantine was considerably more effective than active monitoring at reducing onward transmission by an infected contact. This relative benefit of individual quarantine compared with active monitoring could theoretically be offset, or reversed, by a correspondingly larger perverse incentive, should individuals report fewer contacts when under a policy of quarantine as compared with active monitoring. Both serial interval scenarios were fit using a mean incubation period of 5\u00b72 days, which was derived from a previous study in 451 laboratory-confirmed cases from Wuhan;12 other more recent estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 include a mean of 6\u00b74 days among 88 travellers22 and a median of 4 days among 291 hospitalised patients and outpatients.23 A shorter incubation period relative to the serial interval would be consistent with less presymptomatic transmission. By contrast, a study of cases in China and Singapore found longer average incubation periods (7\u00b71 and 9\u00b70 days) and shorter serial intervals (4\u00b76 and 4\u00b72),24 which indicate an even higher proportion of presymptomatic transmission. In a scenario with these parameters, the relative benefit of individual quarantine over active monitoring would increase, whereas the total number of simulations where control is achieved under individual quarantine would decrease. The incubation period distribution, in addition to the serial interval distribution, is thus a key parameter to refine as additional information becomes available.",

The incremental benefit of individual quarantine over active monitoring was minimal in this scenario, requiring hundreds or thousands of suspected contacts to be quarantined to avert one infection beyond active monitoring alone. These results suggest that with a serial interval similar to that of SARS for COVID-19, there are few plausible conditions under which individual quarantine would offer a sufficient advantage over active monitoring to justify the substantial incremental resources required to implement individual quarantine and large incremental costs to those experiencing it. Furthermore, if the more restrictive policy of individual quarantine instead of active monitoring leads to a decrease in the percentage of contacts traced, through hesitance to name contacts or avoidance of contact tracers, the small incremental benefit of individual quarantine over active monitoring in serial interval scenario 2 might be cancelled out or active monitoring might become more effective than individual quarantine.",

In these circumstances, complementary interventions, such as physical distancing and pharmaceutical interventions, might be needed if efficient contact tracing and rapid isolation are not readily achievable, regardless of the extent of presymptomatic transmission. Furthermore, since contact tracing would be unable to identify contacts infected by individuals who never develop symptoms (ie, asymptomatic infectiousness rather than presymptomatic infectiousness), community interventions such as physical distancing are suited for mitigating transmission by asymptomatic infection, whereas interventions based on contact tracing can address those exposed to individuals known to have the disease. Even if only a small proportion of infected contacts are traced, the potential transmission chains from those contacts could be prevented. The extent to which it is worth investing in imperfect contact tracing will depend on the rate of epidemic growth, which affects feasibility, and the other mix of interventions being considered.",

The model-fitting procedure is tuned to accept a wide range of inputs consistent with published dynamics without over-fitting, thereby allowing for built-in uncertainty of input values. Additional limitations of the model include the focus on early epidemic growth in the absence of depletion of susceptible individuals, and the assumption of a consistent R\n0 across scenarios with different serial intervals. By assuming that relative infectiousness follows a triangular distribution, we might underestimate the effect of contact-tracing interventions if relative infectiousness increases exponentially towards the end of disease instead, or overestimate their effect if relative infectiousness decreases exponentially after the earliest stages; however, our estimate of peak infectiousness at 38% of the duration of infectiousness suggests peak infectivity at neither end of the duration of infectiousness. By assuming the duration of infectiousness follows a uniform distribution, we might exclude long-duration shedders, which can lead to either an underestimation of the effect size if a larger fraction of an individual's infections happen long after isolation, or an overestimation of the effect size if the right tail is long enough such that individuals are released from interventions and are able to spark a second outbreak. Additionally, our choice to consider shifts of the latent period relative to the infectious period implicitly assumes a similar shape to the underlying distributions, albeit with different means. As the amount of presymptomatic transmission will depend not only on the average timing of the latent period relative to the incubation period, but also on the standard deviation of these distributions, more data on their true shapes are urgently needed.",

In our model framework, self-isolation can be conceptualised as a scenario in which all contacts are traced and under active monitoring, since recognition of symptom onset is the event that triggers isolation. Mass quarantine is expected to result in prompt isolation upon symptom onset of any truly infected individuals, but the effect of this strategy on COVID-19 will depend heavily on whether presymptomatic exposure within the group is decreased or increased by the approach to confinement. That is, mass quarantine could reduce or increase the number of uninfected contacts who are exposed to presymptomatic infectiousness of those who go on to develop the disease. In serial interval scenario 1, where a mean of 20% of transmission is expected to occur before symptom onset, the positive effect of prompt isolation can be offset by an increase in presymptomatic transmission in a confined space. Mass quarantines can also result in unintended consequences that can exacerbate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, such as avoidance of contact tracers and inaccurate recall, a reduction in health-care worker support and availability of supplies, and a rise in other infectious diseases more broadly.24 The impact of travel restrictions on human mobility, a necessary first step in the causal chain to outbreak containment, is difficult to measure, but a strong reduction in movement, recorded by mobile phone call detail records, was documented in Sierra Leone during the national lockdowns implemented in response to the 2014\u201316 epidemic of Ebola virus disease.25\n",
