METHODS: Faecal samples were collected from 200 healthy dogs and examined by electron microscopy for presence of viral particles. Data were compared with viral prevalences that had been determined retrospectively by electron microscopy for 936 dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea. RESULTS: There were significantly more negative faecal samples among the healthy dogs (82 0 per cent) compared with 55 8 per cent in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea (P<0 001). With a prevalence of 17 5 per cent, significantly more healthy dogs were shedding coronavirus compared with 11 6 per cent in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea (P50 034). Parvovirus was only detected in one healthy dog (0 5 per cent), thus with a prevalence that was significantly lower than 16 0 per cent detected in the dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea (P<0 001).",

Among the viral species commonly detected in dogs with diarrhoea are canine parvoviruses (CPVs), canine coronaviruses (CCoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PVs). Rotaviruses, caliciviruses and not further classified virus particles have also been described (Hammond and Timoney 1983 , Evermann and others 1985 , Biermann and others 1991 , Finlaison 1995 , Vieler and Herbst 1995 , Mochizuki and others 2001 , Sokolow and others 2005 . Prevalence of enteric viruses in dogs with diarrhoea seems to depend on age of dogs investigated, as well as on vaccination status of affected dogs; however, environmental factors are also thought to play an important role. High prevalences of CPV and CCoV were detected in faecal samples of dogs with diarrhoea from animal shelters, indicating the influence of hygiene and infection pressure (Stann and others 1984 , Tennant and others 1993 , Sokolow and others 2005 . Furthermore, geographic differences may play a role in prevalence of enteric viruses in canine gastrointestinal disease.",

Or if they are an incidental finding of non-pathogenic organisms simply being shed by animals with diarrhoea as a result of another aetiology. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to further investigate this question by evaluating privately owned pet dogs in Southern Germany and to compare viral prevalences in healthy dogs and in dogs with AHD in the same geographic region.",

This assumption is underlined by the results of other studies in which CPV could not be detected in the faeces of healthy dogs (Stann and others 1984 , Hackett and Lappin 2003 , Sokolow and others 2005 . The only dog shedding CPV in this study was a one-year-old male hunting dog that had been adopted from a shelter six weeks earlier and since then had not displayed any gastrointestinal signs. A possible explanation could be a recent natural CPV infection before adoption because some naturally infected dogs have been shown to shed virus for up to 46 days after occurrence of first clinical signs (Decaro and others 2005) . Also, the dog could have ingested CPV contaminated faecal material leading to enteric passage of the virus without systemic infection. This could, for example, happen if the dog is protected by parvovirus vaccination against development of clinical signs but not against infection, thus leading to virus shedding in an asymptomatic animal, as described for puppies shedding ",

The dog was fully vaccinated according to the owner. While this study confirms the role of CPV as a primary enteric pathogen, assessment of the role of CCoV in canine diarrhoea seems to be more difficult. CCoV was detected in 17\u00c15 per cent of healthy dogs and only in 11\u00c16 per cent of dogs with AHD, thus questioning the role of CCoV as a primary intestinal pathogen in dogs. The prevalence of CCoV in dogs with AHD is comparable with older German studies, which examined the faecal samples from dogs with diarrhoea by EM, but so far no information is available about the prevalence of this virus in healthy dogs in Southern Germany. Studies performed in Europe and northern America showed high antibody prevalences of CCoV in up to 59 per cent of healthy dogs from animal shelters (Tennant and others 1993, Sokolow and others 2005) . A study performed by Tennant and others (1993) failed to detect CCoV in the faeces of healthy pet dogs in England.",

            "text": "There are several possible explanations for the high number of healthy dogs shedding CCoV in this study. CCoV belongs to one of three groups of the genus Coronavirus and is genetically closely related to feline coronavirus (FCoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine. Because of the high error frequencies of the RNA polymerase, coronaviruses are prone to rapidly develop point mutations in coding and non-coding sequences, thus resulting in proliferation of different strains, serotypes and subtypes of the virus (Dolja and Carrington 1992) . At least two distinct genetic clusters of CCoV can be identified in naturally infected dogs. Type I CCoV is classified as being genetically closely related to FCoV and type II as representing the ''typical'' CCoV (Pratelli and others 2003) , with both genotypes frequently being harboured by one dog (Pratelli and others 2004) . Because of the broad genetic variability and fast rate of recombination, even specific strains seem to develop within several weeks in the dog population of animal shelters (Benetka and others 2006) . Thus, dogs can be continuously re-infected with new virus variants exhibiting a broad range of antigenic and genetic variability, potentially evading the host's immune response. This might be an explanation why, as is known for FCoV in cats, dogs are also suspected to become persistently infected with CCoV. Dogs were found to shed CCoV for up to 156 days after natural infection, and the virus strains involved underwent several mutations during that period (Pratelli and others 2002) . A persistent infection could therefore also explain the shedding of CCoV in the healthy dogs in this study. Follow-up faecal examinations and genetic sequencing would be interesting options in these patients to assess duration of shedding and strains involved. Because of the wide genetic variation of CCoV, different strains are also thought to have different characteristics concerning pathogenicity and virulence factors, possibly being responsible for variation of clinical signs associated with CCoV infection. Some strains seem to cause severe clinical signs of AHD predominantly in very young dogs (Pratelli and others 2003 , Evermann and others 2005 , Buonavoglia and others 2006 , especially in cases of dual infection with other viral species others 1999, 2001) . Although healthy dogs shedding CCoV were shown to be significantly younger than virus-negative dogs in this study, this difference in age could not be demonstrated for the patients with AHD. Therefore, it could be assumed that healthy young dogs are more likely to serve as hosts and carriers for CCoV, but other factors are probably necessary to cause clinical disease related to CCoV infection.",

The disadvantages of this method are an implied relatively high cost, lack of quantitative results and a lower sensitivity and specificity compared with PCR assays (Schunck and others 1995, Pratelli and others 2000) . New PCR methods have been proven to be up to 4\u00c210 4 times more sensitive than EM and virus isolation for detection of CCoV, thus being able to detect virus also in the faeces of low-grade shedding animals below 10 6 particles per gram of unprocessed faeces, which is considered the detection limit for EM (Naylor and others 2001a) . Because of the lower sensitivity of EM, the prevalence of enteric viruses might have been underestimated in this study, and at the same time, the prevalence of virus-negative animals might have been overestimated. In future studies investigating enteric viruses in the Southern German dog population, strain differentiation, especially concerning CCoV, would be desirable to obtain more information about its strain-associated pathogenicity and clinical characteristics.",
