Quarantine and isolation measures have been widely used, over the decades, to control the spread of diseases such as yellow fever, smallpox, measles, ebola, pandemic influenza, diphtheria, plague, cholera, and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. To achieve the main objective of this study, the autonomous quarantine/isolation presented in [10] will be extended to incorporate time delay and two different incidence functions. The functional forms of the incidence functions to be considered are derived on the basis of the framework described below.",

            "text": "Let S(t),I(t) and N(t) denote the number of susceptible individuals, the number of infectious individuals and the total size of the population at time t, respectively. Further, let \u03b2(N) be the average number of contacts sufficient for transmitting infection (effective contact rate). Then, the force of infection, given by \u03b2(N)I/N, represents the average number of contacts that a susceptible individual makes with infectious individuals per unit time. If \u03b2(N)=\u03b2N (i.e., the contact rate depends on the total population, N), then the incidence function g1(I)=\u03b2I is called mass action incidence. If \u03b2(N)=\u03b2 (a constant), then the incidence function g2(I)=\u03b2I/N is called standard incidence [11], [12]. These two functions are widely used in the modeling the transmission dynamics of the human diseases [13], [14]. Another widely used incidence function is the Holling type II incidence function, given by g3(I)=\u03b2I1+\u03c9I, with \u03c9>0, [15], [16], [17], [18]. The non-linear incidence function of type g3(I) was first introduced by Capasso and Serio [15], in their study of the cholera epidemic in Bari, Italy. The main justification for using such a functional form of the incidence function stems from the fact that the number of effective contacts between infective individuals and susceptible individuals may saturate at high infective levels due to crowding of infective individuals, or due to the preventive measures taken by (and behavioral changes of) the susceptible individuals in response to the severity of the disease [16], [17], [18].",

Since R0H<1, it is clear that (18)\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03bc+\u03c3)\u03a0/\u03bc<\u03b31+\u03d5+\u03bc+\u03b41. Since S(t)\u2264\u03a0/\u03bc in D for all t>0, it follows from the second equation of (16) that (19)I\u02d9\u2264\u03b2\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03bc+\u03c3)I(t\u2212\u03c4)\u03bc[1+\u03c9I(t\u2212\u03c4)]\u2212(\u03b31+\u03d5+\u03bc+\u03b41)I(t). Consider, next, the auxiliary (with equality) equation associated with the inequality (19) (where u is a dummy variable) (20)u\u02d9=\u03b2\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03bc+\u03c3)u(t\u2212\u03c4)\u03bc[1+\u03c9u(t\u2212\u03c4)]\u2212(\u03b31+\u03d5+\u03bc+\u03b41)u(t). Using Item (i) of Lemma 5, together with Eq. (18), in (20) gives limt\u2192+\u221eu(t)=0. Thus, it follows from (19), using the comparison theorem [28], that lim supt\u2192+\u221eI(t)=0. Thus, for any \u03f5>0 sufficiently small, there exists a T>0 such that if t>T, then I(t)<\u03f5. Using S\u2264\u03a0/\u03bc in D and I<\u03f5, for t>T, in the second equation of (16) (note that g(I) is monotone increasing) gives E\u02d9\u2264\u03b2\u03a0\u03f5\u03bc(1+\u03c9\u03f5)\u2212(\u03c3+\u03bc)E. Furthermore, by the comparison theorem, lim supt\u2192+\u221eE(t)\u2264\u03b2\u03a0\u03f5\u03bc(\u03c3+\u03bc)(1+\u03c9\u03f5). Since \u03f5 is arbitrary, it follows (by setting \u03f5\u21920) that lim supt\u2192+\u221eE(t)=0. Hence, for \u03f51>0 small, there exists a T1>T such that if t>T1, then E(t)<\u03f51. Using E(t)<\u03f51, for t>T1, in the fourth equation of (16) gives Q\u02d9\u2264\u03f51\u03c3\u2212(\u03b1+\u03bc)Q, and so lim supt\u2192+\u221eQ(t)\u2264\u03f51\u03c3\u03b1+\u03bc. Hence, lim supt\u2192+\u221eQ(t)=0. In a similar way, it can be shown that lim supt\u2192+\u221eH(t)=0andlim supt\u2192+\u221eR(t)=0.\nFinally, it follows from the first equation of (16), for t>T, that S\u02d9\u2265\u03a0\u2212\u03b2S\u03f51+\u03c9\u03f5\u2212\u03bcS, so, using the comparison theorem, lim inft\u2192+\u221eS(t)\u2265\u03a0(1+\u03c9\u03f5)\u03bc+\u03f5(\u03b2+\u03c9\u03bc). Hence (by letting \u03f5\u21920) lim inft\u2192+\u221eS(t)\u2265\u03a0\u03bc. Additionally, since lim supt\u2192+\u221eS(t)\u2264\u03a0\u03bc in D it follows that limt\u2192+\u221eS(t)=\u03a0\u03bc. Thus, limt\u2192+\u221e(S(t),E(t),I(t),Q(t),H(t),R(t))=(\u03a0\u03bc,0,0,0,0,0)=E0.\n \u25a1 The epidemiological implication of the above result (Theorem 2) is that the combined use of quarantine and isolation can lead to disease elimination if the two interventions can bring (and keep) the threshold quantity, R0H, to a value less than unity (i.e., the condition R0H<1 is necessary and sufficient for disease elimination).",

            "text": "\nProofThe proof of Theorem 3 is based on using the approach given in [30], [31], [32], [33]. It should be noted, first of all, that the second equation of (16) can be rewritten as (24)I\u02d9=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)S(t)I(t)1+\u03c9I(t)\u2212(\u03b31+\u03d5+\u03bc+\u03b41)I(t)\u2212ddt\u222bt\u2212\u03c4t\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)S(x)I(x)1+\u03c9I(x)dx. Consider the following function: V(t)=I(t)+\u222bt\u2212\u03c4t\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)S(x)I(x)1+\u03c9I(x)dx. Clearly, V(t) is bounded (since the variables I(t) and S(t) are bounded). Furthermore, it follows, using (24), that (25)V\u02d9=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)S(t)I(t)1+\u03c9I(t)\u2212(\u03b31+\u03d5+\u03bc+\u03b41)I(t). Since, at the endemic steady state, S(t) is given by S\u2217\u2217=\u03a0\u03bc+\u03b2I\u2217\u22171+\u03c9I\u2217\u2217>0 whenever R0H>1, it is clear that for any 0<q<1,S\u2217\u2217<K, where K=\u03a0\u03bc+\u03b2qI\u2217\u22171+\u03c9qI\u2217\u2217. Hence, there exists a number m\u22651 such that S\u2217\u2217<K(1\u2212e\u2212m\u03a0\u03c4/K).The next task is to show that I(t)\u2265qI\u2217\u2217 for all t\u2265(m+1)\u03c4. Suppose, by contradiction, that I(t)<qI\u2217\u2217 for all t\u2265(m+1)\u03c4. It then follows, from the first equation of (16), for t\u2265(m+1)\u03c4, that S\u02d9(t)>\u03a0\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b2qI\u2217\u22171+\u03c9qI\u2217\u2217)S(t)=\u03a0\u2212\u03a0KS(t). Hence, S(t)>K\u2212e\u2212\u03a0/K[t\u2212(m+1)\u03c4]{K\u2212S[(m+1)\u03c4]},>K{1\u2212e\u2212\u03a0/K[t\u2212(m+1)\u03c4]}, and so, for t\u2265(2m+1)\u03c4, (26)S(t)>K(1\u2212e\u2212m\u03a0\u03c4/K)=S\u02c6>S\u2217\u2217.\nSince I(t)<qI\u2217\u2217<I\u2217\u2217, it follows from (25), for t\u2265(2m+1)\u03c4, that (27)V\u02d9>\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03bc+\u03c3)S(t)I(t)1+\u03c9I\u2217\u2217\u2212(\u03b31+\u03d5+\u03bc+\u03b41)I(t),>\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03bc+\u03c3)S\u02c6I(t)1+\u03c9I\u2217\u2217\u2212(\u03b31+\u03d5+\u03bc+\u03b41)I(t),=[\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03bc+\u03c3)S\u02c61+\u03c9I\u2217\u2217\u2212(\u03b31+\u03d5+\u03bc+\u03b41)]I(t). Let I\u02c6=min\u03b8\u2208[\u2212\u03c4,0]I(\u03b8+2\u03c4(m+1)). It can be claimed that I(t)\u2265I\u02c6 for all t\u2265(2m+1)\u03c4. Suppose the claim does not hold. Then there exists a constant d1>0 such that I(t)\u2265I\u02c6 for t\u2208([2m+1]\u03c4,2[m+1]\u03c4+d1=t\u2217),I(t)<I\u02c6 for t>t\u2217 with I(t\u2217)=I\u02c6 and I\u02d9(t\u2217)\u22640 (see Fig. 6\n). However, it follows from the third equation of (16), when t=t\u2217, that I\u02d9(t\u2217)=e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u03b2S(t\u2217\u2212\u03c4)I(t\u2217\u2212\u03c4)1+\u03c9I(t\u2217\u2212\u03c4)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)I(t\u2217),=e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u03b2S(t\u2217\u2212\u03c4)I(t\u2217\u2212\u03c4)1+\u03c9I(t\u2217\u2212\u03c4)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)I\u02c6,since I(t\u2217)=I\u02c6,\u2265e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u03b2S(t\u2217\u2212\u03c4)I\u02c61+\u03c9I(t\u2217\u2212\u03c4)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)I\u02c6,since I(t)\u2265I\u02c6 for t\u2208([2m+1]\u03c4,t\u2217),>[e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u03b2S(t\u2217\u2212\u03c4)1+\u03c9I\u2217\u2217\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)]I\u02c6,since I(t)<I\u2217\u2217 for t\u2265(2m+1)\u03c4,>[e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u03b2S\u2217\u22171+\u03c9I\u2217\u2217\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)]I\u02c6=0. This contradicts the fact that I\u02d9(t\u2217)\u22640. Hence, I(t)\u2265I\u02c6 for t\u2265(2m+1)\u03c4. Thus, it follows from (27) that V\u02d9>[\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03bc+\u03c3)S\u02c61+\u03c9I\u2217\u2217\u2212(\u03b31+\u03d5+\u03bc+\u03b41)]I\u02c6for all t\u22652(m+1)\u03c4. Hence, limt\u2192\u221eV(t)=\u221e, which contradicts the fact that V(t) is bounded. Finally, to complete the proof, we need to show that I(t)\u2265\u03bd for sufficiently large t.Let t1 be sufficiently large and I(t1)=qI\u2217\u2217. Consider the following interval, [t1,t2]. It follows, from the second equation of (16), that I\u02d9\u2265\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)I. Hence, (28)I(t)>I(t1)e\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)(t\u2212t1)=qI\u2217\u2217e\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)(t\u2212t1),for t\u2208[t1,t2]. It is clear from (28) that if t2\u2212t1\u2264\u03c4, then I(t)\u2265qI\u2217\u2217e\u2212\u03c4(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)=q\u03bd. For the other case (where t2\u2212t1>\u03c4), it is easy to see that the inequity I(t)\u2265qI\u2217\u2217e\u2212\u03c4(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)=q\u03bd also holds for t\u2208[t1,t1+\u03c4]. We claim that (28) also holds for t\u2208(t1+\u03c4,t2]. If not, then there exists a constant d>0 such that I(t)\u2265q\u03bd for t\u2208(t1+\u03c4,t1+\u03c4+d=t0), with I(t0)=q\u03bd,I(t)<q\u03bd for t\u2208(t0,t2) and I\u02d9(t0)\u22640. Here, too, it follows from the third equation of (16), when t=t0, that I\u02d9(t0)=e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u03b2S(t0\u2212\u03c4)I(t0\u2212\u03c4)1+\u03c9I(t0\u2212\u03c4)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)I(t0),=e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u03b2S(t0\u2212\u03c4)I(t0\u2212\u03c4)1+\u03c9I(t0\u2212\u03c4)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)q\u03bd,since I(t0)=q\u03bd,\u2265e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u03b2S(t0\u2212\u03c4)q\u03bd1+\u03c9q\u03bd\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)q\u03bd,since I(t)\u2265q\u03bd,\u2265[e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u03b2S(t0\u2212\u03c4)1+\u03c9I\u2217\u2217\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)]q\u03bd,since q\u03bd\u2264I\u2217\u2217,>[e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u03b2S\u2217\u22171+\u03c9I\u2217\u2217\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)]q\u03bd=0. This contradicts the fact that I\u02d9(t0)\u22640. Hence, I(t)\u2265q\u03bd for t\u2208[t1,t1]. Since this interval and the parameter q\u2208(0,1) are chosen arbitrarily, it is concluded that I(t)\u2265\u03bd. Thus, lim inft\u2192\u221eI(t)\u2265\u03bd. \u25a1\n",

Consider the auxiliary equation of (29): (30)u\u02d9(t)=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(U1S+\u03f5)u(t\u2212\u03c4)1+\u03c9u(t\u2212\u03c4)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)u(t). Since R0H>1, it follows that, for sufficiently small \u03f5>0,\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(U1S+\u03f5)>(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41). Hence, by Item (ii) of Lemma 5 and (30), limt\u2192\u221eu(t)=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(U1S+\u03f5)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)\u03c9(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41). Thus, by the comparison theorem, I\u221e=lim supt\u2192\u221eI(t)\u2264\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(U1S+\u03f5)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)\u03c9(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41), and so I\u221e\u2264\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)U1S\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)\u03c9(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41). Similarly, let U1I=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)U1S\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)\u03c9(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41). Then, for sufficiently small \u03f5>0, there exists a T2>T1+\u03c4 such that I(t)\u2264U1I+\u03f5 for t>T2. It follows from the first equation of (16), for t>T2, that S\u02d9(t)\u2265\u03a0\u2212\u03bcS\u2212\u03b2(U1I+\u03f5)1+\u03c9(U1I+\u03f5), and so, by the comparison theorem, S\u221e=lim inft\u2192\u221eS(t)\u2265\u03a0[1+\u03c9(U1I+\u03f5)]\u03bc+(\u03b2+\u03bc\u03c9)(U1I+\u03f5). Hence, S\u221e\u2265L1S, where L1S=\u03a0[1+\u03c9U1I]\u03bc+(\u03b2+\u03bc\u03c9)U1I. In other words, for sufficiently small \u03f5>0, there exists a T3>T2+\u03c4 such that S(t)\u2265L1S\u2212\u03f5 for t>T3. It follows from the third equation of (16), for t>T3+\u03c4, that I\u02d9(t)\u2265\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(L1S\u2212\u03f5)I(t\u2212\u03c4)1+\u03c9I(t\u2212\u03c4)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)I(t), and so (by considering the auxiliary equation) u\u02d9(t)=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(L1S\u2212\u03f5)u(t\u2212\u03c4)1+\u03c9u(t\u2212\u03c4)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)u(t). Hence, it follows from Item (ii) of Lemma 5 (since R0H>1) that limt\u2192\u221eu(t)=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(L1S\u2212\u03f5)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)\u03c9(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41), and the comparison theorem gives I\u221e=lim inft\u2192\u221eI(t)\u2265\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(L1S\u2212\u03f5)\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)\u03c9(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41). Hence, for sufficiently small \u03f5>0, there exists a T4>T3+\u03c4 such that I(t)\u2265L1I\u2212\u03f5 for t>T4, where L1I=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)L1S\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)\u03c9(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41).\nUsing S(t)\u2264U1S+\u03f5,I(t)\u2264U1I+\u03f5, S(t)\u2265L1S\u2212\u03f5 and I(t)\u2265L1I\u2212\u03f5 in the second equation of (16), for t>T4+\u03c4, gives E\u02d9\u2264\u03b2(U1S+\u03f5)(U1I+\u03f5)1+\u03c9(U1I+\u03f5)\u2212\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(L1S\u2212\u03f5)(L1I\u2212\u03f5)1+\u03c9(L1I\u2212\u03f5)\u2212(\u03c3+\u03bc)E. Hence, by the comparison theorem, E\u221e=lim supt\u2192\u221eE(t)\u2264\u03b2(U1S+\u03f5)(U1I+\u03f5)[1+\u03c9(U1I+\u03f5)](\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(L1S\u2212\u03f5)(L1I\u2212\u03f5)[1+\u03c9(L1I\u2212\u03f5)](\u03c3+\u03bc). Therefore, for sufficiently small \u03f5>0, there exists a T5>T4+\u03c4 such that E(t)\u2264U1E+\u03f5 for t>T5, where U1E=\u03b2U1SU1I(1+\u03c9U1I)(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)L1SL1I(1+\u03c9L1I)(\u03c3+\u03bc).\nSimilarly, by using S(t)\u2264U1S+\u03f5,I(t)\u2264U1I+\u03f5,S(t)\u2265L1S\u2212\u03f5 and I(t)\u2265L1I\u2212\u03f5 in the second equation of (16), for t>T4+\u03c4, we have E\u02d9\u2264\u03b2(L1S\u2212\u03f5)(L1I\u2212\u03f5)1+\u03c9(L1I\u2212\u03f5)\u2212\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(U1S+\u03f5)(U1I+\u03f5)1+\u03c9(U1I+\u03f5)\u2212(\u03c3+\u03bc)E, and so E\u221e=lim inft\u2192\u221eE(t)\u2265\u03b2(L1S\u2212\u03f5)(L1I\u2212\u03f5)[1+\u03c9(L1I\u2212\u03f5)](\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(U1S+\u03f5)(U1I+\u03f5)[1+\u03c9(U1I+\u03f5)](\u03c3+\u03bc). Hence, for sufficiently small \u03f5>0, there exists a T6>T5+\u03c4 such that E(t)\u2265L1E\u2212\u03f5 for t>T6, where L1E=\u03b2L1SL1I(1+\u03c9L1I)(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)U1SU1I(1+\u03c9U1I)(\u03c3+\u03bc). Using E(t)\u2264U1E+\u03f5 in the fourth equation of (16), for t>T5, gives Q\u02d9(t)\u2264\u03c3(U1E+\u03f5)\u2212(\u03b1+\u03bc)Q, and so Q\u221e=lim supt\u2192\u221eQ(t)\u2264\u03c3(U1E+\u03f5)\u03b1+\u03bc. Thus, for sufficiently small \u03f5>0, there exists a T7>T6+\u03c4 such that Q(t)\u2264U1Q+\u03f5 for t>T7, where U1Q=\u03c3U1E\u03b1+\u03bc.Similarly, by using E(t)\u2265L1E\u2212\u03f5 in the fourth equation of (16), for t>T6, we have Q\u02d9(t)\u2265\u03c3(L1E\u2212\u03f5)\u2212(\u03b1+\u03bc)Q, and Q\u221e=lim inft\u2192\u221eQ(t)\u2265\u03c3(L1E\u2212\u03f5)\u03b1+\u03bc. Thus, for sufficiently small \u03f5>0, there exists a T8>T7+\u03c4 such that Q(t)\u2265L1Q\u2212\u03f5 for t>T8, where L1Q=\u03c3L1E\u03b1+\u03bc. Using I(t)\u2264U1I+\u03f5 and Q(t)\u2264U1Q+\u03f5 in the fifth equation of (16), for t>T7, gives H\u02d9(t)\u2264\u03b1(U1Q+\u03f5)+\u03d5(U1I+\u03f5)\u2212(\u03b32+\u03bc+\u03b42)H, and H\u221e=lim supt\u2192\u221eH\u2264\u03b1(U1Q+\u03f5)+\u03d5(U1I+\u03f5)\u03b32+\u03bc+\u03b42. Thus, for sufficiently small \u03f5>0, there exists a T9>T8+\u03c4 such that H(t)\u2264U1H+\u03f5, for t>T9, where U1H=\u03b1U1Q+\u03d5U1I(\u03b32+\u03bc+\u03b42). Similarly, it follows by using I(t)\u2265L1I\u2212\u03f5 and Q(t)\u2265L1Q\u2212\u03f5 in the fifth equation of (16), for t>T8, that H\u02d9(t)\u2265\u03b1(L1Q\u2212\u03f5)+\u03d5(L1I\u2212\u03f5)\u2212(\u03b32+\u03bc+\u03b42)H, and so H\u221e=lim inft\u2192\u221eH\u2264\u03b1(L1Q\u2212\u03f5)+\u03d5(L1I\u2212\u03f5)\u03b32+\u03bc+\u03b42. Hence, for sufficiently small \u03f5>0, there exists a T10>T9+\u03c4 such that H(t)\u2265L1H\u2212\u03f5 for t>T10, where L1H=\u03b1L1Q+\u03d5L1I\u03b32+\u03bc+\u03b42.Using I(t)\u2264U1I+\u03f5 and H(t)\u2264U1H+\u03f5 in the last equation of (16), for t>T9, gives R\u02d9\u2264\u03b31(U1I+\u03f5)+\u03b32(U1H+\u03f5)\u2212\u03bcR. Hence, R\u221e=lim supt\u2192\u221eR(t)\u2264\u03b31(U1I+\u03f5)+\u03b32(U1H+\u03f5)\u03bc. Thus, R\u221e\u2264U1R, where U1R=\u03b31U1I+\u03b32U1H\u03bc. Using I(t)\u2265L1I\u2212\u03f5 and H(t)\u2265L1H\u2212\u03f5 in the last equation of (16), for t>T10, gives R\u02d9\u2265\u03b31(L1I\u2212\u03f5)+\u03b32(L1H\u2212\u03f5)\u2212\u03bcR, and so (by the comparison theorem) R\u221e=lim inft\u2192\u221eR(t)\u2265\u03b31(L1I\u2212\u03f5)+\u03b32(L1H\u2212\u03f5)\u03bc. Hence, R\u221e\u2265L1R, where L1R=\u03b31L1I+\u03b32L1H\u03bc.Continuing in this manner leads to the following sequences: (31)UnS=\u03a0[1+\u03c9Ln\u22121I]\u03bc+(\u03b2+\u03bc\u03c9)Ln\u22121I,LnS=\u03a0[1+\u03c9UnI]\u03bc+(\u03b2+\u03bc\u03c9)UnI,UnI=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)UnS\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)\u03c9(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41),LnI=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)LnS\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)\u03c9(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41),UnE=\u03b2UnIUnS(1+\u03c9UnI)(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)LnILnS(1+\u03c9LnI)(\u03c3+\u03bc),LnE=\u03b2LnILnS(1+\u03c9LnI)(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)UnIUnS(1+\u03c9UnI)(\u03c3+\u03bc),UnQ=\u03c3UnE(\u03b1+\u03bc),LnQ=\u03c3LnE(\u03b1+\u03bc),UnH=\u03b1UnQ+\u03d5UnI(\u03b32+\u03bc+\u03b42),LnH=\u03b1LnQ+\u03d5LnI(\u03b32+\u03bc+\u03b42),UnR=\u03b31UnI+\u03b32UnH\u03bc,LnR=\u03b31LnI+\u03b32LnH\u03bc.\nFinally, since LnS\u2264S\u221e\u2264S\u221e\u2264UnS,LnE\u2264E\u221e\u2264E\u221e\u2264UnE,LnI\u2264I\u221e\u2264I\u221e\u2264UnI,LnQ\u2264Q\u221e\u2264Q\u221e\u2264UnQ, LnH\u2264H\u221e\u2264H\u221e\u2264UnH and LnR\u2264R\u221e\u2264R\u221e\u2264UnR, the proof is concluded by showing that limn\u2192\u221eUnS=S\u2217\u2217=limn\u2192\u221eLnS,limn\u2192\u221eUnI=I\u2217\u2217=limn\u2192\u221eLnI,limn\u2192\u221eUnE=E\u2217\u2217=limn\u2192\u221eLnE,limn\u2192\u221eUnQ=Q\u2217\u2217=limn\u2192\u221eLnQ,limn\u2192\u221eUnH=H\u2217\u2217=limn\u2192\u221eLnH,limn\u2192\u221eUnR=R\u2217\u2217=limn\u2192\u221eLnR. Using the first four sequences of (31), it is easy to see that the sequence Un+1S can be written in terms of UnS as (32)Un+1S=\u03c92\u03a02e\u22122\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)UnSk2+e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(\u03b2+\u03c9\u03bc)[\u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212k]UnS, where k=\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41. Furthermore, it can be shown that whenever \u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)>k, the sequence UnS is monotone as follows: Un+1S\u2212UnS=[\u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212k][\u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)+k\u2212(\u03b2+\u03c9\u03bc)e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)UnS]UnSk2+e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(\u03b2+\u03c9\u03bc)[\u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212k]UnS. Since S\u2217\u2217\u2264UnS, it follows that Un+1S\u2212UnS\u2264[\u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212k][\u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)+k\u2212(\u03b2+\u03c9\u03bc)e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)S\u2217\u2217]UnSk2+e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(\u03b2+\u03c9\u03bc)[\u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212k]UnS,=0(since S\u2217\u2217=\u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)+ke\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(\u03b2+\u03c9\u03bc)). Thus, limn\u2192\u221eUnS exists.Let M=limn\u2192\u221eUnS. Then, it follows from (32) that M=\u03c92\u03a02e\u22122\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)Mk2+e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(\u03b2+\u03c9\u03bc)[\u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)\u2212k]M, and so M=limt\u2192\u221eUnS=\u03c9\u03a0e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)+ke\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)(\u03b2+\u03c9\u03bc)=S\u2217\u2217. Taking the limit as n\u2192\u221e of both sides of the third sequence of (31) gives limn\u2192\u221eUnI=\u03b2e\u2212\u03c4(\u03c3+\u03bc)S\u2217\u2217\u2212(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)\u03c9(\u03d5+\u03b31+\u03bc+\u03b41)=I\u2217\u2217. Similarly, taking the limits of both sides of the remaining sequences in (31), and using the previous results, gives limn\u2192\u221eLnS=S\u2217\u2217,limn\u2192\u221eLnI=I\u2217\u2217,limn\u2192\u221eUnE=limn\u2192\u221eLnE=E\u2217\u2217limn\u2192\u221eUnQ=limn\u2192\u221eLnQ=Q\u2217\u2217,limn\u2192\u221eUnH=limn\u2192\u221eLnH=H\u2217\u2217,limn\u2192\u221eUnR=limn\u2192\u221eLnR=R\u2217\u2217. Hence, limt\u2192\u221e(S(t),E(t),I(t),Q(t),H(t),R(t))=E1H. \u25a1\n",

It should be stated that the GTA recorded about 250 probable cases of SARS during the 2003 outbreaks [21]. The simulation results obtained, depicted in Fig. 9\n, show that while the model without time delay (considered in [10]) underestimated the observed cumulative number of probable cases (about 170 cases), the model with time delay (i.e., model (3)) gave a good estimate of the observed data (about 220 cases). Thus, this study suggests that the model (3), with time delay, is more appropriate for modeling the SARS outbreaks in the GTA than the corresponding model without time delay (given in [10]). Similar simulation results were obtained for the case of the model with Holling type II function (16) (see Fig. 10\n).",

Furthermore, this model has a unique positive endemic equilibrium whenever the threshold quantity (R0S) exceeds unity (Lemma 4).(ii)The model with Holling type II incidence function, given by (16), has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free solution whenever its associated epidemiological threshold quantity (R0H) is less than unity (Theorem 2). This model has a unique positive endemic equilibrium whenever the threshold quantity (R0H) exceeds unity (Lemma 7). Furthermore, the model system is permanent whenever R0H>1 (Theorem 3).

In other words, the theoretical results in this study show that the quarantine/isolation model with time delay (\u03c4>0) and standard or non-linear incidence function of Holling type II has essentially the same qualitative (equilibrium) dynamics as the corresponding autonomous quarantine/isolation model (\u03c4=0) with the standard incidence function considered in [10].",
