            "text": "In a globalized world where the spread of infectious diseases appears to ignore all boundaries and the risk of emerging pathogens is on the rise (Jones et al. 2008 , Fisher et al. 2012 , there has been a resurgence in interest by academics, the general public and both national and international government authorities in the geography of human infectious diseases at all spatial scales. Since most endemic and emerging human pathogens utilise non-human animal species at some stage in their transmission cycles (e.g. reservoir and intermediate hosts and vector species) (Taylor et al. 2001, Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005) , biogeographers and community ecologists are increasingly involved in this pursuit. Their contributions have yielded a range of novel and complementary insights on the spatial and temporal patterns of infectious disease occurrence, emergence and burden, their underlying ecological processes, and their surveillance and management (Guernier et al. 2004 , Smith et al. 2007 , Peterson 2008 , Reperant 2010 , Johnson et al. 2015 , Murray et al. 2015 , Stephens et al. 2016b .",

Given that this type of multi-scale, multi-disciplinary complexity is commonplace in biogeography, and much precedence exists from the study of parasitism, plant and animal diseases and global change ecology, there has never been a better time for biogeographers and ecologists to contribute their knowledge, theory and methods to public and global health. Critically, where strong links between human health and the environment are identified and quantified, such collaborations could stimulate novel streams of funding and yield cost-effective co-benefits for health and the environment (Myers et al. 2013 , Waldron et al. 2017 . This is particularly salient for research on human infectious diseases, most of which involve animal hosts and vectors in shaping their distributions and are therefore influenced by many of the same ecological processes that govern biodiversity patterns more generally (Guernier et al. 2004 , Murray et al. 2015 . Analogous to its utility for understanding wildlife distributions, biodiversity patterns and improving conservation management, biogeography has the potential to improve our understanding of infectious disease distributions, describe and explain patterns and processes underlying pathogen diversity ('pathodiversity') and contribute to infectious disease forecasting, risk management and threat abatement. Through the analysis of historical disease, host and/or vector occurrence and co-occurrence patterns, biogeographic approaches could even yield some of the earliest, and in some cases the only, insights into poorly known, burgeoning and future infectious disease risks (Murray et al. 2015) .",

Better understanding of pathogeography among ecologists and improved biogeographic knowledge among veterinary and medical scientists and public health managers should help improve disease surveillance, combat the global burden of human infectious diseases, and improve environmental management.

(2016b) recently reviewed the community ecology and macroecology of infectious diseases, respectively, and a natural intersection between these disciplines and the biogeography of infectious diseases occurs where these fields become spatially explicit. Macroecology deals with ecological questions that demand large-scale analysis (Brown 1995 , Brown and Lomolino 1998 , Cox et al. 2016 . The limits between biogeography and macroecology are fuzzy. They converge when biogeography is focused on the study of how population-or community-level parameters vary along geographic dimensions (Lomolino et al. 2006) , or when macroecology deals with spatial patterns (e.g. the geographic distribution of a certain pathogen species or diversity patterns). The divergence occurs when spatially explicit components are not crucial to answering questions being addressed by macroecology (Blackburn and Gaston 2006) , and when biogeography does not invoke structural and functional patterns of ecological systems (e.g. areography and some evolutionary biogeography approaches) (Morrone 2009 ). By contrast, community ecology offers further insights on the mechanisms and processes that bridge fine scale processes of individuals and populations with the ecology and evolutionary processes of species and disease distributions at larger spatial scales (Johnson et al. 2015) .",

Taylor et al.

Discovery and recognition of new human pathogens occurs regularly (Woolhouse et al. 2008) , with the most recent comprehensive inventory that we are aware of listing 2107 pathogens in humans (274 viruses, 1003 bacteria, 447 fungi, 82 protozoa and 301 helminths) (Wardeh et al. 2015) .",

Surprisingly, the distributions of most of these are very poorly known. As recently as 2013, only 7 infectious diseases were considered 'comprehensively mapped' (including Old World coltiviruses, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, monkey pox, dengue, Lassa fever and Mayaro) (Hay et al. 2013) , fundamentally limiting the ability of public and global health resources to be systematically and efficiently directed towards precise geographic areas and populations at highest risk from other impactful diseases. Indeed, distributional patterns of human infectious diseases are generally far more poorly compiled and characterized (e.g. often at only country or regional level and as coarse presence vs absence data) than many plant and animal species, for which numerous global stock takes, status assessments, occurrence databases and detailed distribution maps exist following a long tradition of biogeographic study (Wallace 1876 , Murray et al. 2015 ) (see also Supplementary material Appendix 1 Table A1 ). However, with the development of big data approaches and curated databases, resources are slowly improving for human infectious diseases (Wardeh et al. 2015 , Stensgaard et al. 2017 . Data may even on occasion be far richer or more geographically precise than for many plant and animal species (especially invasive species) owing, for example, to notifiable disease reporting requirements, such as those in place in EU member states for reporting human cases of certain diseases to ECDC and zoonotic and food-borne diseases to other EU registries (e.g. haemorrhagic cases of dengue and Rift Valley fever, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, West Nile fever, cholera, campylobacteriosis) (Lindgren et al. 2012 ). In addition, databases for specific groups of diseases (e.g. helminths, neglected tropical diseases) and host-pathogen (including human) associations are increasing (e.g. \ue02c www.thiswormyworld.org/ \ue02e).",

The close association between animals and human pathogens means that the diversity of potentially pathogenic microorganisms that occur in animals including wildlife is also of major interest for human health (Morse 1995, Murray and Daszak 2013) . However, at present, the full dimensions of this broader 'pathogen pool' are almost entirely unknown. For example, estimates of the total number of viruses within just nine target viral families from the first intensively sampled wildlife species (the natural host of Nipah virus, fruit bat Pteropus giganteus) suggest that the number of known human pathogens is just a tiny fraction of the total viral diversity that occurs in wildlife (Anthony et al. 2013 ).",

It might also be represented to reflect the process of transmission itself (e.g. 'force of infection'). With some information on the average impact of infections in humans, public health practitioners often also describe spatial and temporal patterns of disease in terms of 'burden', with various available measures that broadly seek to capture the loss of healthy life (e.g. death and disability) attributable to the presence of certain diseases within a population (e.g. disability adjusted life years, DALYs) . Conversely, the absence of disease is of equal interest for pattern and process analysis, but harder to obtain given the sampling difficulties of asserting freedom from disease (Cameron 2012 ). Furthermore, occurrence records (and its derivatives) will generally be a subset of actual occurrences, because in most cases they will be heavily influenced by observation effort.

            "text": "Such developments have facilitated the study of the spatial structure of some infectious diseases in unprecedented detail ( Fig. 1) . In some cases, there has been innovation in the integration of these approaches with mechanistic models traditionally used to explore the population dynamics of infectious diseases (Redding et al. 2016) , and some analyses have been developed and updated in close to real time (e.g. during the west African Ebola outbreak) (Pigott et al. 2014 (Pigott et al. , 2016 . These advances complement an already strong suite of tools already used in epidemiological studies, which might equally flow the other way into the toolboxes of ecologists (Magalh\u00e3es et al. 2011 , Caprarelli and Fletcher 2014 , Bhatt et al. 2017 . Peterson (2008) defined the first explicit 'biogeographic framework' for human infectious diseases. Drawing on the work of Sober\u00f3n (2007) on the Grinnellian niche and geographic distributions of species, the framework is characterized by considerations of a pathogen's dispersal ability combined with the abiotic and biotic factors that interact to determine whether a disease is able to fulfill its full geographic potential. Although not explicitly demonstrated, Peterson (2008) emphasizes that a key difference between pathogens and diseases in comparison to free ranging wild species (with the exception of invasive species) is the relative unpredictability of dispersal events (e.g. rapid, long distance introductions), and the relatively lower importance of abiotic and relatively higher importance of biotic factors. This applies particularly to the high degree of inter-specific interactions, from the infection of a pathogen in a host, to the numerous other species that may be involved in pathogen transmission cycles. The distribution of an infectious disease is thus defined by the joint distributions of all species involved in its transmission cycle as dictated by the suitable ecological conditions and dispersal limitations for each.",

These elements could range from no knowledge, no data and large barriers to the collection of new data (e.g. for many emerging infections in developing country contexts, such as at the beginning of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa), to high degree of knowledge from existing scientific studies, well developed and accessible databases on relevant geographic/environmental, reservoir host, vector, pathogen, human and disease data, and existing structures to streamline the collection of new data (e.g. high impact diseases in developed country contexts, such as malaria in the EU).",

This may be particularly the case for macroecological and biogeographical studies, which are often data intensive and conducted at scales that may be difficult or impractical to undertake new data collection. There is thus a clear need to expand the scope of research programmes on infectious diseases to encompass the geographic, biological and temporal scales relevant to biogeographical analysis. This involves informing monitoring and surveillance activities on what types of data would be most useful and urgent. Improving data capture and quality with standardized sampling methodologies could help lead to analyses and discoveries that transcend the specific epidemiological details of a single site, geographical context or disease.

            "text": "\u2022 Operational taxonomic units: potential complications for biogeographic pattern and process analysis may arise when the 'presence' of a specific disease type is in fact confounded. This could occur, for example, if multiple causal agents result in disease complexes (e.g. Leishmaniasis) or if the causal agent is unknown and diseases are instead classified by their symptoms (e.g. syndromes). Distributional data and databases on infectious diseases should thus strive for the highest 'taxonomic resolution' possible (Murray et al. 2015 , Stensgaard et al. 2017 ). \u2022 Observation effort: a persistent issue in robustly quantifying occurrence, in any form, is its relationship to observation effort (Allen et al. 2017) . Observation effort could vary spatially, temporally or taxonomically. Presence, prevalence, burden and diversity patterns of infectious diseases, hosts and vectors may all increase proportionally to observation effort, and confidence surrounding reported absences also increases with observation effort. Failing to account for this has the potential to introduce biases in biogeographic studies. Numerous studies have taken steps to incorporate measures of observation effort to limit the potential effects of observation bias in biogeographic studies of infectious diseases, typically by including factors hypothesised to be related to observation effort, such as sampling intensity, GDP, health expenditure or publication output, in statistical models (Jones et al. 2008 , Hopkins and Nunn 2010 , Yang et al. 2012 , Murray et al. 2015 ) (see also O in Box 2). \u2022 Sampling protocols: a lack of communication between biostatisticians and field workers in both ecological and health fields before collecting samples can lead to a breakdown in robustness of subsequent analyses. For example, sampling too many host individuals of one species could be as problematic as not sampling enough from a target host (e.g. humans), particularly when research resources are constrained. Best practices involving probability sampling should be pursued where possible (Nusser et al. 2008 ). \u2022 Geographic coverage and resolution: sampling should cover a sufficiently large area(s) to reproduce in space what really exists in the field; for example, metapopulation or metacommunity geographic distributions with sources and sinks of pathogen transmission. The effects of uneven sampling across space and one-shot sampling should be avoided (Peterson 2014) . At the other extreme, improving precision on available data points is a high priority for developing robust geo-referenced databases of disease (or pathogen, host, vector) occurrence. All data should be collected and stored for subsequent access at the highest spatial resolution possible (i.e. GPS coordinate locations). \u2022 Temporal coverage: infected hosts including humans may travel long distances during disease incubation periods, introducing uncertainty in the attribution of the geographic location of infection (Peterson 2014) . Surveillance and sampling strategies should thus allow the capture of appropriate temporal scales (i.e. matching scale of disease-relevant processes) so that data can be better aligned with covariate information such as environmental variables and human activities. \u2022 Phenology: animal and plant phenology should be monitored; the behavior and biology of most species, including humans, are influenced by often relatively predictable annual changes in climate that determine when they start or finish natural events, such as flowering and fruiting, breeding and mass gatherings. Many of these activities and departures from norms due to, for example, unusual weather events have implications for disease risks and spatio-temporal distributions, and could have large implications when considering the influences of large scale change (e.g. climate change). \u2022 Humans as hosts and dispersers: humans will often serve not only as hosts but also as effective dispersal mechanisms for infectious agents. Although this can lead to unpredictability and extreme long distance invasion events (Peterson 2008) , data on human populations and their movement are being increasingly well resolved at both fine and coarse spatial scales and this is proving invaluable in decomposing biogeographical components of many infectious disease systems including emergence risks (e.g. use of flight or road traffic data, mobile phone use data, social media) (Colizza et al. 2007 , Balcan et al. 2009 , Wesolowski et al. 2012 , Jurdak et al. 2015 ). \u2022 Concurrent covariate sampling and time-lagging: ideally, assessment of environmental and social variables should be conducted at the same time as human or wildlife disease sampling (if it is not available at the appropriate scale retrospectively i.e. from remote sensing data). Peterson (2014) discusses a range of issues relevant to modeling the distribution of infectious diseases, including quality control of input occurrence data, sampling design with the reduction of oversampling in certain areas, and design of analysis (see also Hosseini et al. 2017 ).",

Although they did not identify their study explicitly as 'biogeographic', there are clear parallels with Peterson's (2008) framework (as well as many others, such as Plowright et al.'s (2017) recent treatment of spillover ecology). We develop these ideas further in Box 2, focussing on the interactions between a number of inter-dependent elements, including: physical geography (G), environment (E), reservoir host(s) (R), vector(s) (V), pathogen(s) (P), human factors (H), and the management (M) and observation (O) landscapes, the latter serving as the lens through which all other elements and disease distributions (D) are ultimately observed. From this framework, we can envisage how these elements may act and interact to influence both the real and observed distributions of specific diseases in space and through time, as well as multidisease patterns that may emerge at higher levels of organization (see 'Emergent patterns and multiple diseases' below).",

Whereas G and E will almost always have some kind of modifying influences, single-element transmission source systems (i.e. diseases only involving human-human, environmental, single reservoir species or single vector species transmission) represent the least biogeographically complex examples in this framework. Examples include tetanus (E), measles (H), and Lassa fever (R). The more biogeographically complex diseases involve multiple elements; for example, multiple reservoir host or vector species (R n and V n , respectively) in addition to human-human or environmental transmission (e.g. dengue (HV n R n ); infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans (EV n R n )). We describe the potential utility and demonstrate an application of this general framework further in Box 3, by undertaking a 'disease trait profiling' exercise whereby we classify a large number of clinically relevant human infectious diseases according to their transmission sources (i.e. the E, H, V and R elements described in Box 2). The trends that emerge illustrate how certain disease characteristics are far more common than others (e.g. transmission from animal reservoirs vs arthropod vectors) and the extent to which mapping efforts are already underway. However, the analysis also highlights some important gaps. For instance, 31.9% of diseases with a strong rationale for mapping (as rated by Hay et al. 2013) have not been mapped in any study (Box 3, Fig. panel F) , and declining overall quality of mapping efforts correlates with increasing biogeographic complexity (Box 3, Fig. panel  G) , highlighting a need to expand the breadth of ecological interactions considered within disease systems to improve mapping quality in future studies.",

When applied to pathogens, hosts and/or reservoirs and vectors, SDM is useful for understanding risk factors conditioning the distributions, emergence or the accumulation of new outbreaks of disease. In SDMs, the available information on the presence or the incidence of disease is linked to a diverse set of environmental variables and allows the evaluation of the degree to which certain environments are favourable for the occurrence of disease, even in areas where it has not been detected before. In the absence of, or in combination with, local-scale data suitable for (Pigott et al. 2016) . Illustrating the detail of modern cartographic projections of disease risk based on models of environmental suitability for the zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus (shaded colours) and the spatial variation in disease risk that would be masked from country-level chloropleths (thick black lines). Dotted lines indicate regions that have reported no index cases to date but are predicted to be partially at risk based on environmental suitability models that utilize a thresholding approach on the model output that captures 95% of the occurrence records used for model fitting (see also Fig. 6 ). Boosted regression trees were used to develop the model based on georeferenced records of Ebola virus disease outbreaks in humans and infection records in bat reservoirs and a range of environmental covariates. The scale reflects the relative probability that zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus could occur at these locations; areas closer to 1 (dark red) are more environmentally similar to locations reporting Ebola virus occurrences; areas closer to 0 (light yellow) are least similar. mechanistic models, SDMs can take advantage of the large geographic scale to explore macroecological processes that are able to explain and predict the occurrence of disease. This can reveal emergent patterns and processes not perceptible at the local scale (Brown 1995) , and can help lay a foundation for hypothesis testing or provide a geographic context for further studies on the ground (Allen et al. 2017) .",

            "text": "Disease trait profiling could help synthesize and summarize the range of potential ecological interactions of diseases and highlight important priorities or gaps for biogeographic analyses. To illustrate, we classified all clinically relevant diseases within the GIDEON database with single causative pathogens (n \ue035 186 diseases) into each of the combinations possible considering whether disease transmission sources included the E, H, V and R elements outlined in Box 2 (note, although H is by definition always involved for human infectious diseases, here it is treated more specifically as a transmission source i.e. human-human transmission). We then examined how variations in the complexity of diseases, as indicated by the number of elements involved in their transmission (complexity score, CS), was related to geographic range size (as broadly indicated by the number of countries in which the disease is present), the rationale for mapping, whether mapping efforts had already taken place, and the quality of existing mapping as rated by Hay et al. (2013) . Consistent with other studies, 71.0% of diseases in our dataset involved (but do not necessarily require) transmission to humans from animal reservoirs (zoonotic) (Fig. A) . Human-human transmission was also common (40.3%), while diseases including potential transmission from vectors (31.7%) or environmental sources (21.5%) were less common. For diseases involving vectors or reservoirs, the great majority involved multiple vector (95%) or reservoir (85%) species rather than single species (Fig. A) . Diseases ranged considerably in their degree of 'biogeographic complexity', but only 15 of 35 possible combinations were represented in our dataset (Fig. B) . The least complex examples involved transmission from the environment (E) only, a single reservoir (R) only, or humanhuman (H) only (CS \ue035 1), while the most biogeographically complex diseases involved multiple vectors, reservoirs and could include either environmental (EVnRn) or human-human (HVnRn) transmission as well (CS \ue035 8). On average, diseases including humanhuman transmission were the least biogeographically complex ('H' mean CS \ue035 3.0), followed by diseases including transmission from reservoirs ('R' CS \ue035 4.0), while diseases involving transmission from the environment ('E' mean CS \ue035 4.3) and vectors ('V' mean CS \ue035 5.2) were more complex. On average, complexity was not obviously related to commonness (Fig. C) , but more complex diseases tended to be more geographically restricted (Fig. D) , and had both a stronger rationale for mapping (Fig. E) as well as a higher proportion of diseases that had already been mapped (Fig. F) , particularly when human-human or environmental transmission were never involved (traits that can radically increase their distributions to the point of making them essentially ubiquitous). However, the quality ratings of existing mapping efforts for more complex diseases were considerably lower on average than for simpler diseases (Fig. G) . These trends illustrate the extent to which mapping efforts are already underway for clinically relevant infectious diseases but also highlight some important gaps. For instance, as of Hay et al.'s (2013) study, 31.9% of diseases with a strong rationale for mapping had not been mapped in any study (Fig. F) , and declining overall quality of mapping efforts for more restricted and biogeographically complex diseases highlights a clear need to address the breadth of ecological interactions within disease systems in future studies. on the spatial distribution of some infectious diseases (Stephens et al. 2009 (Stephens et al. , 2016a .",

While biogeography has already made significant contributions to providing a generalized framework for disease mapping (Peterson 2014, Escobar and Craft 2016) , we emphasise that it is the comparative power of biogeography that could help take pathogeography a step further, diverging more radically from medical geography, to address the factors that govern the structure, assembly, dynamics and spatial patterns of multiple or entire assemblages of human infectious diseases over a more diverse range of spatial and temporal scales.

However, with the exception of using host distributions as a simple proxy for the potential distributions of pathogens (Daszak et al. 2012) , the distribution of reservoir species has only recently been used as an explanatory variable, together with other environmental descriptors, to define a pathogen distribution model (e.g. compare Peterson et al.

When the ecology of a pathogen is complex and unresolved (e.g. Ebola virus, Leroy et al. 2004 , Groseth et al. 2007 , Olival and Hayman 2014 , imposing restrictions to the selection of host or vector species considered in a model might under-represent the zoological substrate conditioning a pathogen's transmission and distribution (Roche et al. 2012) . Olivero et al. (2017a) thus addressed the mapping of favourable areas for the Ebola virus in the wild by combining two biogeographical approaches: SDM and chorotype analysis. Mammalian chorotypes in Africa were employed as surrogates of the types of distributions shown by reservoirs and any wildlife species implicated in the virus spillover cycle. Olivero et al. (2017a) found that a model based on a number of diversity patterns, each one associated with a different mammalian chorotype, defined favourable areas for the presence of Ebola virus with higher accuracy than did a model based on environmental variables alone (i.e. climate, forest type), concluding that mammalian biogeography contributes significantly to explaining the distribution of Ebola virus in Africa. In addition, vegetation was identified as a factor placing clear limits to the presence of the virus. Favourable areas for Ebola virus were thus determined from information provided by both models (Fig. 2) .",

Although strongly heterogeneous (Fig. 3 ) (see also Stensgaard et al. 2017) , some striking patterns suggest that human infectious disease communities are shaped by the same ecological processes that shape the diversity of life more generally (Guernier et al. 2004) . This is evident, for example, from observations of a clear latitudinal gradient in disease diversity and disease range sizes, whereby disease richness decreases and range size increases towards the poles (Fig. 4) (Guernier et al. 2004, Guernier and Gu\u00e9gan 2009) . Other patterns are consistent with island biogeography theory, such as a positive relationship between land surface area and disease richness (Smith and Gu\u00e9gan 2010) , and reduced richness on smaller islands and with distance to the nearest mainland (Jean et al. 2016 ). Together, these findings likely explain why the strongest predictor of human infectious disease richness known to date is wildlife richness (Dunn et al. 2010) , while some vector groups show similar patterns (Foley et al. 2007 ). These patterns also illustrate that a correlation between human disease diversity and wildlife/ vector diversity may not necessarily imply direct causation.",

(2015) show that human infectious disease assemblages exhibit biogeographic regionalisation reminiscent of zoogeographic patterns, particularly for zoonotic (Fig. 5A, B) , vector-borne and parasitic diseases, and that mammalian assemblage similarity is consistently among the strongest predictors of human infectious disease assemblage similarity among countries (Fig. 5C ). Such an effect is very likely predictive of as-yet undescribed patterns of microbial diversity, such as the geographic structure recently demonstrated among novel coronaviruses detected in wild bat hosts (Anthony et al. 2017) . In addition to this dominant explanatory effect of biodiversity, other factors, including environmental (climate, land area, population size), social (human connectivity, health expenditure, observation effort) and epidemiological characteristics (e.g. pathogen type, transmission mode) also affect infectious disease \u03b1and \u03b2-diversity patterns (Fig. 5C ). The strongest \u03b2-diversity patterns, for example, can be observed in zoonotic, vector-borne and parasitic infectious diseases, likely due to a more dominant role of environmental factors and persistence of historical dispersal barriers limiting their geographic distributions, while patterns of humanspecific diseases are far more homogenous at the global scale (Smith et al. 2007 , Dunn et al. 2010 , Just et al. 2014 , Murray et al. 2015 , Jean et al. 2016 ) (see also Box 3 Fig. panel D) .

Nestedness occurs where species assemblages are subsets of the biotas at more diverse sites (Wright and Reeves 1992, Ulrich and Gotelli 2007) , and indicates a non-random process arising from any factor that promotes the orderly disaggregation of assemblages (Gaston et al. 2000) . The latitudinal gradient of human infectious diseases exhibits such a pattern, with disease assemblages occurring at higher latitudes being subsets of those occurring closer to the equator (Fig. 4C ) (Guernier et al. 2004 ). In contrast, turnover indicates the replacement of some species by others as a consequence of environmental sorting or spatial and historical constraints (Qian et al. 2005 , Baselga 2010 ). In the only assessment of nestedness vs turnover undertaken so far for human infectious diseases that we are aware of, both nestedness and turnover appear to contribute to overall differences in infectious disease assemblages among countries at a global scale, with the relative contribution varying between major epidemiological classes (Murray et al. 2015) . For example, nestedness dominates differences in human-specific diseases, whereas turnover dominates differences in zoonotic and vector-borne diseases.",

Increasing pathogeographic awareness, participation and collaboration among ecologists, biogeographers and veterinary and medical practitioners could thus contribute to closing the gap between environmental and health management, increased inter-disciplinary research and management efficiency, and reductions in the global burden of disease.",

Yellow indicates countries that contain some environmentally suitable areas for Ebola. Darker colour indicates countries that do not contain areas predicted to be suitable for Ebola. The overlap in top 22 priority countries between (B) and (C) is ~70%. The approach taken in (A/B) requires no specific information about the target disease and could provide a relevant biogeographic 'prior' for planning (e.g. having an emergency response plan in place), reacting to novel appearance of diseases (e.g. for prioritizing surveillance), in data poor settings, and for conservative risk assessment. The approach taken in (C) is more refined and specific but also more data intensive (see Fig. 1 for more detail).",
