The spike or S glycoprotein is a transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of about 150 kDa found in the outer portion of the virus. S protein forms homotrimers protruding in the viral surface and facilitates binding of envelope viruses to host cells by attraction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in lower respiratory tract cells. This glycoprotein is cleaved by the host cell furin-like protease into 2 sub units namely S1 and S2.

In addition to using nonstructural proteins, SARS-CoV could utilize its protein accessories to avoid immune responses. For example the gene segment located on ORF3b of this virus has the ability to antagonize the INF signaling pathway and cause inhibition of the effector cell activation cascade for eradication and inhibition of viral replication [39] .

They recognize PAMP comprised nucleic acids, carbohydrate moieties, glycoproteins, lipoproteins and other small molecules that are found in the structural components of viruses or intermediate products such as dsRNA and induce cascade signaling to produce immune system cell effectors. Each of the PRRs could induce a different biological response to subsequent protein activation [23, 26]. For example, Toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) might recognize the outer component of CoV, the protein spike. Furthermore, through mediation of MyD88, this introduction will trigger the activation of NF-\u03baB transcription factors and the pathogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway to induce proinflammatory proteins. Meanwhile, activation of endosomal receptors such as TLR-3 and TLR that could recognize the RNA or dsRNA genome of coronavirus leads to recruitment of TRIF adapter protein directly.
