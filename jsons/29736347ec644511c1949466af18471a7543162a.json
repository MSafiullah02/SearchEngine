The SIR dynamics are expressed using stochastic differential equations. We first optimize the parameters of the model using RMSE as loss function on the available data using L-BFGS-B gradient descent optimisation to minimise this loss function. This helps to gain better approximation of the model's parameter for specific country or region. The derived parameters are aggregated to project future trends for the Indian subcontinent for next 180 days, which is currently at an early stage within the infection cycle. The projections are meant to function a suggestion for strategies for the socio-political counter measures to mitigate COVID-19. This study considers the current data for India from various open sources. The SIR models prediction is found following the actual trends till date. The inflection point analysis is important to find out which countries have reached their inflection point of the number of infection. We found that if current restrictions like lockdown in India continues with same control, then India will observe it\u015b peak in active patients count on 22 May 2020, it will take 28 August 2020 for 90% of the peak active infections to end. Inspired from the study of DDI Lab at Singapore university of technology and design (SUTD), this study additionally tries to model and quantify the variations in the count of active patients in the country which might occur due to effect of waiver in restrictions. It should be noted that these results were predicted using COVID-19 data of India",

COVID-19 has been devastating for the whole world. Some regions are in initial stages of this epidemiology like India. Moreover, India hosts huge population, there is an eminent danger and most of those population are under the poverty-line or the countries do not have huge resources for medical interventions for affected patients. The choices are limited -either choose herd immunity which may backfire and it is too risky or lockdown and restrict the population from traveling. Thus, we attempt to think about the share of population allowed to move around (some are essential services and a few not obeying the orders) and assuming the mobility factors appropriately, we attempt to predict what can happen during the lockdown. In most of SIR modelling studies [2] done for India, the parameters like \u03b2 and \u03b3 were inspired from European nations which do not model the dynamics of India. Some studies [3] make initial guess for parameters by taking R(0) = 0. This study deals with the dynamics governing the evolution of the COVID-19 infections are modelled employing a stochastic equation SIR model, inspired from [4] and [5] , we study developing model for India specific predictions. We first optimize the parameters of the model using RMSE as loss function on the available data using L-BFGS-B gradient descent optimization to minimise this loss function. This helps to gain better approximation of the model's parameter for specific country or region. An aggregate of those parameters has been used for projecting the longer-term trends for the Indian region, multiple projections have been generated by varying the exposure factor E f that influences the growth rate of infections. This is done in order to provide insights for selective quarantining and lockdowns. The SIR model is one among the only disease models we have to elucidate the spread of an epidemic through \u2022 what is the utmost number of individuals which will have the disease at one time?",

From Figure 7 , it is evident that the curve shifts to left with increase in E f , which means that when restrictions are waived off, the number of infections will be high and growth rate will also be very high. If current restrictions are continued i.e. E f = 1, then total number of active infections will start to decrease after 22 May 2020. These results are in accordance with the study by DDI lab, Singapore university of technology and design [8] . In addition, this study also models the effect of any waivers on social restrictions with E f > 1, the total number of Figure 11 . Daily new cases/day predicted by SIR model infections are expected to increase before reaching its peak. From Figure 7 and 8, with waiver in restrictions, the number of new infections will be much higher than the recovery. Figure 9 shows that with help of restrictions we can control the number of infections as well as the rate at which are approaching the peak of curve. From Figure 10 , it is evident that only China and South Korea have reached the inflection point which means that infections are yet to reach it's peak in India. The model tells us that to scale back the impact of the disease we would like to lower the 'contact ratio' the maximum amount as possible -which is strictly what the present social distancing measures are designed to try to do. Figure 11 , for E f =1, it shows that the count of daily new cases per day will decrease to 97% of its peak on 16 July 2020 and 99% on 8 August 2020.",

To model the impact of travel restrictions like lockdown, social distancing on the reproduction number; we used a parameter E f whose value is used to simulate the effectiveness of social restrictions. With more travel restriction like lockdown the value of E f decreases and hence, effective contact rate decreases which results in reduced R0 [9] .
