Current efforts in the field of drug discovery are particularly concerned with the handling of chemical structural information so that properties of a ligand are optimized to address the multiple demands of a potent drug (Brown 1998) . Chemoinformatics mainly emerged due to the enormous amount of data that has been generated by recent drug discovery attempts, including high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry methodologies (Russo 2002) . Chemoinformatics include several modeling approaches aiming at successful drug design. For instance, the development of quantitative relationships between the observed biological activities and the chemical structures through construction of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) models and the prediction of ligand-protein structures via docking approaches are among the most widely used techniques. It is important to highlight that the methods employed in chemoinformatics are usually developed to handle large sets of chemical structures and their different properties (usually referred as molecular descriptors) and thus should be appropriate for big data analysis.",

The recently released curated small-molecule databases are valuable assets for testing and validating chemoinformatics algorithms and tools (Hu and Bajorath 2012) . There are many databases (either publicly available or proprietary) containing a number of chemical substances. The size of typical databases ranges between tens of thousands and millions of compound entries (Leach and Gillet 2007) . The most well used public databases are PubChem (Wang et al. 2009 ), ZINC (Irwin et al. 2012) , BindingDB (Liu et al. 2007) , and ChEMBL (Gaulton et al. 2012) . ZINC contains the three-dimensional structures of commercially available compounds, which were constructed to be used in structurebased virtual screening, while PubChem, BindingDB, and ChEMBL also include (bio)activity information. Additionally, PubChem provides screening information data sets (SIDS) and the three-dimensional structures of the majority of the compounds, and in BindingDB and ChEMBL databases the activities of compounds can be assembled into relevant classes. Activity classes are of particular usefulness toward benchmarking of new computational methodologies (Hu and Bajorath 2012) .",

Such applications include CDK, Indigo, RDKit, Vernalis, CACTVS, Enalos, Lhasa, OpenBabel, OCHEM, Chemical Identifier Resolver, ErlWood, EMBL-EBI Nodes, and CheS-Mapper. Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) is an open-source analytics platform, which is the leading tool for wide-ranging data processing, integration, analysis, and exploration (Berthold et al. 2008) . It enables the visual creation of data flows (so-called pipelines), the selective execution of specified analysis steps, and the presentation of the results via interactive views on models and data. KNIME offers intuitive use and high level of scalability, which currently render it the most popular platform for chemoinformatics applications. Therefore, as already mentioned, this chapter will be mostly devoted to the description of software tools that employ KNIME to accomplish their functions.",

Since toxicity assessment of NPs via traditional experimental routes often require expensive and time-consuming procedures, computational approaches such as quantitative nanostructure-activity relationships (QNARs) have been successfully used to predict the toxic effects of NPs (Vrontaki et al. 2015; Kleandrova et al. 2014a, b; Speck-Planche et al. 2015; Winkler et al. 2013 Winkler et al. , 2014 Shao et al. 2013; Toropov et al. 2013) . However, the computational investigation of NP toxicity is seriously hindered by the lack of available NP descriptors, organized datasets, and systematic experimental data for NPs. Only few organized datasets on NP toxicity are available so far. Among these toxicity datasets on nanostructures, metal oxide NP data have been investigated in several computational studies (Fourches et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2011 Liu et al. , 2013a Puzyn et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012) .",

Values for descriptors such as the size, R1 and R2 relaxivities, and zeta potential along with a coating-indicative parameter were considered as independent variables for the model development. The values of the input variables for each NP and the corresponding toxicity class are shown in Table 1 . (Liu et al. 2011; Epa et al. 2012) c R1: spin-lattice relaxivity; R2: spin-spin relaxivity d NHit: the number of hits identified for each NP across the 64 bioactivity measures (4 cell lines X 4 assays X 4 concentrations) NPs were evaluated with different assays in various cell types and concentrations that produced a 64-component vectorial metric. Each NP was characterized either active or inactive according to the number of hits obtained across the 64 bioactivity measures. For the QNAR developed KNIME workflow, the following steps have been integrated: (1) data preprocessing, (2) variable selection, (3) model development and (4) validation, and (5) determination of domain of applicability [via the Enalos Domain -Similarity node that defines applicability domain (APD) based on euclidean distances].

Descriptors D026 and D741 indicate the number of oxygen atoms and Ar-CHDX groups that may be present in the compound. Descriptor D282 encodes the structural information content order-1 index. This descriptor represents a graph theoretical invariant, which considers the molecular graph as being a source of different probability distributions, to which the information theory is applied (Todeschini and Consonni 2009 ). D470 encodes information as described by Geary topological structure autocorrelation length-8 weighted by atomic Sanderson electronegativities. The Geary index denotes spatial autocorrelation and is a distance-type function which varies from zero to infinite. D509 encodes information regarding the atomic polarizabilities combined with Moran topological structure autocorrelation length-7. Moran coefficient (value range between 1 and C1) indicates the spatial autocorrelation and is associated with atomic properties, the number of atoms, and the topological distance between them. Descriptors D545 and D575 represent the lowest eigenvalue from Burden matrix (Burden 1989 ) weighted by van der Waals order-6 and the highest eigenvalue from Burden matrix weighted by van der Waals order-4, respectively (Burden et al. 2009 ). Burden descriptors weighted by van der Waals have been shown to be very selective descriptors and in turn useful for similarity searching (Todeschini and Consonni 2009) .",

Thus, 70 compounds (Kre\u010dmerov\u00e1 et al. 2007) were used in the test set, while the remaining 309 compounds were combined into one dataset to train the model. It was observed that an activity cutoff of 50 M yields a relatively good accuracy. Despite that models developed by different activity thresholds (10 or 30 M) were successful in distinguishing inhibitors (>90 %) from noninhibitors ( 65 %), they lacked a balanced class distribution (predicting adequately both classes instead of predicting accurately only one), which clearly affects the quality of the model. Therefore, new models were constructed based on the 309 compounds set (200 compounds in the training set, 109 compounds in the test set). From the models for each activity threshold (10, 30, 50, and 100 M), one model (at 50 M) displayed superior performance over the others. That is, it predicted 92 % of inhibitors and 78 % of noninhibitors with a MCC coefficient of 0.71, and a G-mean score (0.84), which reflects the high quality. Finally, the best YFV inhibition model (at 50 M) was implemented into KNIME workflow to become freely available for use in medicinal chemistry applications.",

As already mentioned, a reaction vector represents the changes that occur during a reaction. This is described in a descriptor scheme that is enhanced in the products (positive descriptors, they represent bonds gained in products) and is diminished from the reactants (negative descriptors, they represent bonds lost from reactants). In de novo design, the practical role of reaction vectors is to propose synthetic ways to new compounds by achieving a balance between specificity and generality. Namely, the reaction vectors should be specific enough in order to avoid their application in environments which disfavor the course of a reaction, but encoding part of the environment will hamper their ability to generate novel structures. It was shown that such a balance may be obtained by combining atom pairs separated by one and two bonds (Patel et al. 2007 ). The reaction vectors employed by Patel et al. are modifications of the original descriptors developed by Carhart et al. (1985) . More detailed information on reaction vectors can be found in Patel et al. and references therein (Patel et al. 2009 ).",
