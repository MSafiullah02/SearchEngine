            "text": "In mid-December 2019, a cluster of unidentified pneumonia cases named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical symptoms resembling viral pneumonia. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of respiratory specimens revealed a novel beta corona virus to be present, which has subsequently been named severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1\u20135]. COVID-19 pneumonia is characterized by fast spread, wide epidemic range, and major respiratory dysfunction. The number of reported cases rose rapidly and by 26 February 2020, there were more than 78,100 confirmed cases (65,596 in Hubei Province) with 2718 deaths (2104 in Hubei) reported, and with an additional 2019 suspected cases in China [6]. In addition, 2918 confirmed cases had appeared in many other countries throughout the world [6]. Global attention was soon focused on the situation because of the increasing number of new cases and the high death rate associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early diagnosis will enable patients to be isolated and treated in good time, essential for avoiding the spread of disease, improving prognosis, and reducing mortality. Thus, early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia is of great significance.",

For example, two patients with a Wuhan exposure history who showed expected features on CT images had a negative result on the initial but not on a follow-up RT-PCR test. Therefore, when the result of the RT-PCR test is negative for a patient with CT features typical of viral pneumonia and history of potential exposure, the patient should be isolated, closely observed, and undergo further RT-PCR testing.",

For example, three patients with mild clinical symptoms only showed pharyngeal discomfort but because one of their family members had been diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, they underwent CT scans. Their CT images revealed multiples opacities to be present in the lungs, and subsequently, they also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on a RT-PCR test. In addition, some patients showed obvious improvements of symptoms after receiving treatment but the follow-up CT suggested there would have been a significant progression. Therefore, for some suspicious patients with mild clinical symptoms, CT examination is recommended for the detection of lesions, early diagnosis, and assessment of the disease progression. Moreover, follow-up CT scans should be performed for evaluating the efficacy of treatment during hospitalization.",

Firstly, the sample size is relatively small and the reported CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia should be considered preliminary rather than definitive. Secondly, follow-up CT scans were only obtained for 40 of the 55 patients and thus the full range of disease appearance may not be represented. Thirdly, the relatively small sample size may account for why no children are included in this study. Whether children may be less likely to become infected or, if infected, display milder symptoms is obviously an important question to be addressed in future studies.",
