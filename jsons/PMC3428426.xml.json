            "text": "Autoproteolytic proteins pose unique challenges to understanding structure\u2013function relationships because their cleavage is an intrinsic consequence of folding. This post-translational modification is involved in the regulation of protein folding,1 cell signaling,2 nucleoporin biogenesis,3 apoptosis,4 and the function of many enzymes.5., 6., 7. These studies have established that self-cleavage proceeds through an N\u2013O(S) acyl shift mechanism: an active-site nucleophile (Thr, Ser, or Cys) attacks into its N-terminal peptide bond generating a (thia)oxazolidine intermediate (Fig. 1a).8 This transient species collapses to a (thio)ester, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to yield two subunits bearing new N- and C-termini. The N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) generated by autoproteolysis is used by enzymes, such as the Thr-utilizing proteasome \u03b2-subunit (P\u03b2S),9 in a catalytic diad (or triad) for catalysis. It was originally believed that all Ntn-utilizing enzymes belonged to the same superfamily (dubbed the Ntn superfamily).5., 10. However, subsequent research showed that a second group of enzymes exists (the D/O superfamily), which is related to the Ntn superfamily through convergent evolution.11 Together, these enzymes perform a diverse array of hydrolysis and acyl transfer reactions.",

Consequently, a comparison between the functional active site before and after autoactivation is possible for only two systems, glycosylasparaginase14., 15. (GA) and P\u03b2S.9., 16. This lack of mechanistically relevant structural information constitutes a fundamental gap in our understanding of how a single protein sequence is optimized to facilitate both autoproteolysis and enzymatic catalysis in its mature form. Because cephalosporin acylase (CA) and penicillin acylase, both members of the Ntn superfamily, are currently the subject of directed evolution experiments to improve the industrial production of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics,17., 18. further insights may provide valuable lessons in the development of enzymes with improved activity. Addressing this problem will rely on the ability to compare and contrast structural changes upon autoactivation for both Ntn and D/O superfamilies. To this end, we sought to extend our analysis of ThnT by determining the mature structure of the enzyme and elucidating the features necessary for substrate binding and catalysis.",

            "text": "A 6-h room temperature incubation of ThnT purified from heterologous expression afforded autoproteolytically activated enzyme suitable for X-ray crystallography. Wild-type ThnT crystallized under similar conditions and in the same space group as the mutationally inactive precursor ThnT T282C. Diffraction to high resolution and phasing by molecular replacement yielded the 1.8-\u00c5 crystal structure of wild-type ThnT. For clarity, all residues of ThnT referenced hereafter will be numbered according to their position in the precursor protein. Autoproteolysis generates two subunits, \u03b1 and \u03b2, composed of residues 1\u2013281 and 282\u2013399, respectively. Like most structurally characterized Ntn enzymes, the subunits of ThnT remain intimately intertwined after activation with global features comparable to their uncleaved forms (Fig. 2a).11., 19. The N-6His tag and the first 23 residues of the \u03b1\u2010subunit were not observed, as was the case for the T282C structure. A short linker sequence leading into the scissile bond of the proenzyme, residues 274\u2013281, showed few tertiary interactions and modeled with very high average B-factors (41.4 \u00c52).13 These disordered residues comprise the C-terminus of the \u03b1\u2010subunit, and as we anticipated, they are not observed in the structure of mature ThnT. Interestingly, comparable disorder in precursor proteins and nascent C-termini has been found in many autoproteolytic systems.14., 20. This observation is readily explained as a strategy employed to promote dissociation of the C-terminus, which must occur to expose the active site of the mature enzyme.",

Surprisingly, the peptide \u03c9 angle of Thr282 consistently refined to a strained 167\u00b0. Comparable strain was observed at this position in the proenzyme inactive state, and we hypothesized that this destabilization was used to help drive formation of the reactive conformation.13 Hence, it appears that retention of this unfavorable geometry is a consequence of the selection for an active site that can promote two different chemical reactions. The energetic penalty of straining this bond may be offset by the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Thr282 and the amide nitrogen of Asn217, which would be disrupted upon relaxation of the \u03c9 angle. The amide proton of Phe144 and \u03b4NH2 of Asn217 comprise the oxyanion hole of ThnT for autoactivation.13 In the major conformer of the precursor structure, a single water molecule occupied the oxyanion hole, taking the place of the reactive carbonyl. A similar placeholder is not observed for mature ThnT; instead, a glycerol molecule and additional water molecules are bound in the active site (Fig. 2b).",

Notably, the solvent-filled groove that may represent the substrate binding site is not present prior to autoactivation and is only revealed upon a conformational change in residues Arg74\u2013Thr80, which includes cis\u2013trans isomerization of the Gly77\u2013Pro78 peptide bond (Fig. 3b). This dramatic structural rearrangement is promoted electrostatically by reorienting the carbonyl of Arg74 away from Asp321 and positioning it 1.4 \u00c5 closer to the side chain of Lys300. The new conformation allows the amide nitrogens of Gly76 and Gly77 to hydrogen bond with the backbone of Leu318 and Asp321, respectively. Additionally, there is a net release of four water molecules, which is entropically favorable.21 These transitions stabilize the loop relative to the uncleaved form, which is corroborated by a decrease in the average B-factor of the loop from 18.5 \u00c52 prior to cleavage to 11.6 \u00c52 in the mature enzyme. Together, these data demonstrate that specific structural features of ThnT promote the isomerization of the Arg74\u2013Thr80 loop.",

These residues correctly orient the nitrogen lone pair to accept a proton from the nucleophile (Fig. 2b).

Hence, it is now possible to distinguish between system-specific features and general features of their active sites. The catalytic activity of P\u03b2S relies on a hydrogen bond network very similar to that shown in Fig. 2b. However, the active site of each protein is formed from different parts of their topologically distinct folds (Fig. 4\n), reinforcing their relationship through convergent evolution. Consequently, it appears that this hydrogen bond network represents an optimal balance between facile autoactivation and substrate catalysis. We recently reported that the Thr \u03b3-methyl may accelerate the intramolecular cyclization that occurs during the N\u2013O acyl shift in autoproteolysis.13 This phenomenon is known as the RRE (Reactive Rotamer Effect),25 and a similar effect may apply to any reaction for which the rotamer distribution may be shifted to favor the reactive state by the addition of steric bulk. This is precisely the case for ThnT and P\u03b2S, where the inactive g+ rotamer is structurally viable for both Thr and Ser but is destabilized by Thr because the \u03b3-methyl shields a hydrogen bond with Gly322 (in ThnT) or Lys33 (in P\u03b2S).9 Similarly, the g+ rotamer cannot be formed for the ornithine acyltransferases (members of the D/O superfamily) because it would cause a strong 1.7-\u00c5 steric clash with the Thr111 in the oxyanion hole.26 Hence, comparison of ThnT with P\u03b2S and other Ntn enzymes reveals unique features of each active site that promote formation of a reactive state. Combined with the role of the RRE in autoproteolysis, we believe that these effects strongly and specifically contribute to the selection of Thr nucleophiles in autoproteolytic systems.",

The slow timescale of the apparent hydrolysis, however, suggested that the phenomenon could be due to a contaminating protease. Although inclusion of protease inhibitors failed to prevent this cleavage, N-terminal sequencing showed that hydrolysis occurred two residues prior to the first observed residue in the crystal structure.

Hence, development of an HMK inhibitor of ThnT could simultaneously answer the long-standing question concerning the mode of attachment of HMKs to this class of enzyme while providing detailed information about the substrate binding interactions of ThnT.

            "text": "Although a definitive mechanism for inactivation of ThnT is beyond the scope of the present study, the co-crystal structure establishes that ThnT is alkylated at the nucleophilic position and that few alternatives exist with respect to the mechanism of this derivatization. For the Ser proteases, the nucleophile attacks into the carbonyl forming an oxyanion that displaces the adjacent halide forming an oxirane intermediate. This three-membered ring is subsequently opened by attack of the His residue of the catalytic triad, resulting in a second covalent attachment.31 Were a comparable mechanism involving an oxirane to occur in the inactivation of ThnT, its formation would obey the well-known stereoelectronic requirement that attack of the oxyanion into C\u2032 proceeds anti-periplanar to the chloride leaving group (Fig. 6b). The location of the oxyanion is well defined by the location of the oxyanion hole of ThnT. Modeling this species shows that placement of the chloride anti-periplanar to the oxyanion results in a strong steric clash with Ser320 and the carboxylate of Asp321. Because this geometry is intrinsic to oxirane formation, and the ThnT active site harbors features that would significantly impede expulsion of the chloride, we do not believe that inactivation of ThnT occurs through an oxirane intermediate. Instead, the ether linkage reported here is most similar to the thioether formed upon derivatization of the cysteine proteases papain,32 SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) peptidase,33., 34. and hepatitis A viral 3C.29 For the latter two enzymes, an episulfonium species was also trapped, presumably as an intermediate of the inhibition process. A comparable mechanism for ThnT would involve a highly unstable oxonium species that is unlikely to occur (Fig. 6c). Together, these constraints suggest that the mechanism of HMK inhibition in ThnT is distinct from those reported for the serine and cysteine proteases.",

Although the data presented here do not provide a ready explanation for the inability of ThnT to cleave phosphopantetheine, the catalytic activity of ThnT is clear. Formation of the Michaelis complex places the carbonyl of the scissile amide into the oxyanion hole (Fig. 7\n). The majority of the enzyme\u2013substrate interactions are in the pantothenate binding region defined by the ThnT\u2013inhibitor structure (Fig. 5b), consistent with the capacity of ThnT to efficiently hydrolyze a variety of pantetheinylated compounds.12 The cysteamine moiety of the substrate provides the ideal distance for the carboxylate of thienamycin to form a salt bridge with Arg148. The catalytic nucleophile is centered within the active site, and its exposure to solvent is minimized by Phe144 and Phe348 from the opposite subunit. Like other N-terminal amidohydrolases,5., 38. the \u03b1-amine deprotonates the hydroxyl of Thr282 to generate a reactive nucleophile. Attack into the substrate generates a tetrahedral intermediate whose collapse is concurrent with protonation of the amine leaving group. Studies have shown that amidohydrolases often provide a hydrogen bond acceptor to facilitate inversion of the nitrogen,39 and we hypothesize that Ser320 may satisfy this role for ThnT (Fig. S2). Expulsion of the amino leaving group generates thienamycin and an acyl\u2010enzyme intermediate. A water molecule in a position similar to Wat1 or Wat2 (Fig. 2b) is then activated by the \u03b1-amine, which hydrolyzes the acyl\u2010enzyme intermediate, regenerating the ThnT active site.",

In all systems, dissociation of the nascent C-terminus after autoproteolysis is favored by a lack of tertiary contacts. When autoproteolysis is initiated through a si-face attack, the same oxyanion hole is used for both self-cleavage and substrate catalysis. Within the active site, the Thr \u03b3-methyl facilitates this chemistry by directing the nucleophile into a reactive state. Lastly, we identified large structural rearrangements necessary for the formation of the ThnT substrate binding pocket. Although P\u03b2S is \u201cinsignificantly different\u201d16 before and after autoproteolysis, most other enzymes from the Ntn superfamily (including penicillin acylase,40 CA,41 and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase20) show evidence of a unique conformational rearrangement. These enzymes each contain a high degree of similarity with the ThnT proenzyme active site but are structurally divergent after autoproteolysis. We propose that this is evidence of a more general phenomenon. Autoprocessing systems with shared chemistry, regardless of lineage, will have comparable features prior to autoprocessing that may dissipate as each protein rearranges to its unique mature state. The observation that two markedly different conformations of the Arg74\u2013Thr80 loop of ThnT (Fig. 3b) facilitate each of the hydrolytic chemistries highlights the orchestrated complexity of the structure\u2013function relationship in autoproteolytic enzymes. Not only does sequence encode for an intrinsically reactive folded state but also, as we have shown here for ThnT, the downstream consequences of this self-cleavage result in spontaneous reorganization to the catalytically competent state of the mature enzyme.",

The carbapenem substrate and covalent intermediates were generated with the structure drawing functionality of Discovery Studio 2.1 and manually docked in the active site of ThnT. Generally, the system was typed with the CHARMM force field and minimized using an adopted basis NR algorithm.47 Crystallographic waters were explicitly included in all minimizations. Attempts to position the substrate or inhibitor in an orientation substantially different from the observed conformation (e.g., placing the chlorine atom inside the oxyanion hole) resulted in significant active\u2010site distortion. All rotamers of the CMK C\u2032\u2013Cl bond were independently minimized before and after oxyanion formation in order to assess the capacity of ThnT to accommodate reactive intermediates. All hydrogen bonding interactions defined by the inhibitor-bound structure were constrained to \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5 of their measured values. The algorithm exited after achieving a root-mean-squared gradient of < 0.1 kcal/(mol \u00c5). All other settings were default.",

(a) Abstraction of a proton by a general base (B:) initiates cis-autoproteolysis with Thr (X = O, Y = CH3), Ser (X = O, Y = H), or Cys (X = S, Y = H) nucleophile. The activated residue attacks into its N-terminal amide bond, resulting in a (thia)oxazolidine ring that collapses to a (thio)ester with concomitant protonation of the amine leaving group by a general acid (AH). The \u03b1-amine activates a water molecule for hydrolysis of the (thio)ester, creating a new N-terminal residue. (b) Mechanism of ThnT hydrolysis of a pantetheinylated carbapenem. The N-terminal amine acts as a general base to activate the nucleophile for attack into the carbonyl of the pantetheine side chain. The \u03b1-ammonium donates a proton back to the amine leaving group, generating an acyl-enzyme intermediate. In a manner directly comparable to autoactivation, the \u03b1-amine again activates a water molecule to hydrolyze the substrate from the enzyme, returning it to its resting state. This hydrolytic chemistry is standard among Ntn-utilizing enzymes.",

Both formation of the oxirane and its collapse to an ether are unlikely to occur within the ThnT active site.
