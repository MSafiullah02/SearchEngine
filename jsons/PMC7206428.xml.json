Italy we have developed a standardized protocol when approaching patients on maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) and kidney transplant recipients, respectively (1). Reports would suggest a more severe disease course in patients with CKD(2) although outcomes in MHD patients is still unclear with earlier small case series suggesting a milder course (3). Management of MHD patients in the context of an epidemic poses several challenges: this group of patients usually requires caregiver assistance, transportation from home to the dialysis units as well as spending periods of time in crowded waiting areas before and after treatment(4). Moreover, MHD patients are usually old and affected by several comorbidities that are known to be associated with high risk of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.",

In our cohort including four centers of the \u201cBrescia Renal COVID task force\u201d, we have identified 94 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As expected, infected MHD patients not requiring hospital admission experienced a better disease course compared to patients who required hospitalisation. Nevertheless, 5% of the patients treated in the outpatient setting subsequently required admission. There was also substantially less use of antiviral medications in patients managed in the outpatient setting although the proportion of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine was similar between the two groups. This should be taken into account when interpreting the results since it was the managing physicians decision to start medications. While the lower rate of antiviral use was associated with lower incidence of adverse events in the outpatient group, whether this may be the result of less frequent antiviral use rather than a better overall disease profile needs to be clarified. Finally, in our cohort, only a few patients were treated with glucocorticoids and tocilizumab, which does not allow us to draw any conclusions on the potential efficacy of these treatments.",
