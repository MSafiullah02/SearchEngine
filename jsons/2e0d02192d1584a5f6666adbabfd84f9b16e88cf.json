Epid., 1970, 97: 585-592.-A seroepidemiologic study of infection by coronavirus strains 229E, OC38, OC43, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A-59, is described. In adults with upper respiratory disease, two \"outbreaks\" of coronavirus infection occurred, one during the winter of 1965-1966 associated with complement fixing (CF) antibody responses to OC38, OC43 and MHV, and the other during the following winter associated with CF antibody responses to 229E, In hospitalized children, infection with 229E was rare; infection with OC38, OC43, and MHV occurred less often in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract disease (3.5%) than in a control group with non-respiratory tract disease (8.2%). The limitations of the CF test using available coronavirus antigens are discussed.",

The distinctive appearance of these viruses by electron microscopy suggested that they be designated as a new group, the \"coronaviruses\" (7) . Members of the group are medium-sued, RNA-containing, and etherlabile, and bear characteristic club-shaped surface projections. Nine of the 23 strains recovered from the human respiratory tract were originally isolated in human embryonic tracheal organ culture (HETOC) (1, 3, 6, 8) . Three of the nine were subsequently adapted to growth in monolayer tissue cultures and two others (OC38 and OC43) were successfully adapted to growth in suckling mice and shown to be antigenically related to several strains of MHV by CF tests and fluorescence staining (6, 9, 10) . The 14 remaining human strains were originally recovered in tissue culture monolayers and appeared antigenically similar or identical to the prototype tissue culture strain, 229E (2, 5) .",

CF and neutralizing antibodies to several strains of 685 MHV were found in military recruits before any coronavirus strains had been recovered from man (11) . Epidemiologic analysis of these findings indicated that, although fourfold rises in antibody were frequent, there was no discernible association with disease. Both strain 229E and strain B814 have been shown to cause colds in adult volunteers (1, 12) . Preliminary seroepidemiologic surveys performed in this laboratory suggested that 229E, OC38, and OC43 infection occurred with sporadic frequency in adults with upper respiratory tract disease (5, 9) . This report describes a more extensive seroepidemiologic study using the available CF antigens from human strains and an antigen of MHV, strain A-59, shown by Hartley and others to detect CF antibody in human sera (11) .",

There was no evidence that coronavirus infection potentiated the pathogenic effect of infection by either parainfluenza virus 3 or RS virus, the two viruses found most often in conjunction with coronaviruses (table 3) . DISCUSSION These studies were undertaken to define more clearly the seroepidemiology of coronavirus infection in adult and pediatric popu-lations. Serum samples and nasopharyngeal washings were studied from adults with colds occurring in two two-year periods. During the first period (1962-1964) detectable coronavirus infection was uncommon. However, in the winter of 1965-1966, members of the OC38-OC43-MHV group were prevalent and detectable both by serologic and organ culture techniques. One year later members of the 229E group were prevalent and again detectable by both serologic responses and virus isolation. It is of interest that among adults all the coronavirus recoveries and most of the coronavirus serologic responses occurred in the four winter months of December, January, February, and March. In several surveys of colds in adults, respira-tory disease was common during these winter months but rhinovirus infection, though frequent in the fall and spring, was rare (13, 16, 17) . This pattern of rhinovirus infection prevailed in this study during the period 1965-1967. Thus, during these winter months coronaviruses although still accounting for less than 50 per cent of colds, became the predominant identifiable organisms associated with adult upper respiratory disease.",

It may be that the presence of severe LRTD requiring hospitalization interfered in some way with infection of the respiratory epithelium by coronaviruses. On the other hand, it seems more likely that this negative correlation reflects the fact that it was not possible to select a completely comparable control group. Control children were drawn from different pediatric wards, and their lengths of stay in the hospital frequently differed from those of the test group.

            "text": "The infrequency of detectable CF antibody to 229E in the pediatric population studied here was surprising. Although 229E virus infection may indeed be rare in children, several other explanations for this anomalous finding are possible. The 229E antigen, in contrast to the other coronavirus antigens, may have reacted with CF antibody to a narrow range of coronavirus serologic types, owing either to the type of tissue in which it was made, or to some characteristic of the virus itself. Possibly serum CF antibody (as opposed to serum neutralizing, or secretory antibody) did not develop in children in response to 229E virus infection. Studies of 229E neutralizing antibody in different age groups would contribute to the clarification of this finding.",

In contrast, the strains isolated in organ culture include at least two and probably several more anti-genie types (10) . One type, exemplified by strains OC38 and OC43, is clearly related to the MHV group. The other type or types have an indefinite relationship with MHV and with the OC38-OC43 group. In particular, patients yielding coronaviruses in organ culture varied markedly in their antibody responses to the CF antigens used in this study. One such patient showed in multiple tests no rise to any of the coronavirus antigens. Two others showed responses in some tests and not in others. Infection with strain B814 was likewise difficult to detect serologically, using OC38, OC43, MHV and 229E antigens (10) . The heterogeneity of antibody response in subjects with known or presumed coronavirus infection, and the probable insensitivity of presently available serologic tests in the detection of coronavirus infection indicate that the serologic studies reported here do not describe a complete picture of coronavirus infection. It is probable that undetected coronavirus infections occurred in these populations during the study periods. CF antigens from the other known coronavirus strains, and further efforts to isolate and characterize new strains will contribute to further definition of the epidemiology of coronavirus infection.",
