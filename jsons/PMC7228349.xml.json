Since Wuhan is one of the cities with the largest volume of kidney transplants in China, COVID\u201019 infection in renal transplant recipients deserves attention. As a population living with immunosuppression, the clinical manifestations, treatment and prognosis of COVID\u201019 pneumonia for renal transplant recipients may differ from those of the general population.\n5\n However, no relevant reports have as yet been published. Herein, we report a case of COVID\u201019 pneumonia following kidney transplantation, which was successfully recovered after treatment with immunosuppressant reduction coupled with low dose methylprednisolone\u2010based therapy. Our intervention protocol thus may serve as a template for the treatment of other such patients.",

Regarding the case discussed in this report, overall clinical characteristics (symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT) were similar to those of other non\u2010transplanted adult patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia (ie, those patients without atypical or silent manifestations due to immunosuppression\n6\n).

Next, considering the progress of the patient's illness and his subsequent improvement, immunosuppressive agents were gradually reinstated. However, for the period prior to reinstating oral immunosuppressants, we considered it important to use appropriate doses of intravenous corticosteroids. The immunosuppressive effect of corticosteroids might protect the renal allograft from acute rejection and avoid imminent Addison crisis in the period of the discontinuation of oral steroid; moreover, the anti\u2010inflammatory effect of corticosteroids may also reduce alveolar exudation and relieve systemic symptoms (such as fever or fatigue) caused by the storm of inflammatory factors.\n9\n, \n10\n It is crucial to pay attention to the dosage and duration of steroid administration. Long duration and excessive doses of steroids may adversely affect recovery due to the inhibition of antiviral immunity, and may also result in other side effects related to steroids.\n11\n In the present case, the patient was given 40mg of methylprednisolone daily for 12 days, which may have played an important role in the faster recovery from his pneumonia without the occurrence of severe side effects.",
