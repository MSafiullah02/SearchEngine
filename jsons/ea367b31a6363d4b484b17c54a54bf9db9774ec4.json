The pathogen was confirmed to be a distinct clade from the \u03b2-coronaviruses, which was officially named SARS-CoV-2 with the disease termed COVID- 19 . Liver injury has been reported in several recent COVID-19 studies, but its incidence varies [3, 4] . In addition, Gu et al and Xiao et al concluded that gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) (diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain) should not be ignored during the outbreak of COVID-19 [5, 6] . Song et al also reported a case with diarrhoea as the onset symptom, and emphasized that gastrointestinal system might be a potential route for SARS-CoV-2 infection [7] . However, the latest epidemiological study showed a relatively low prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms induced by SARS-CoV-2 [3] . Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the liver injury and the prevalence of GIS in COVID-19 patients.",

In addition, the heterogeneity among the studies we included was assessed by the Q and I 2 statistic [10] . When I 2 < 50%, the fixed effects model was applied to estimate risk using the DerSimonian and Laird method because of lower heterogeneity. In contrast, the random effects model was used when I 2 was > 50% [9] . A p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Figure 1 showed the search flowchart and twenty-one studies were included with a total of 3024 COVID-19 patients [3, 5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .

Moreover, nausea and vomiting are not necessarily caused by SARS-COV-2 infection and may be the result of various system dysfunctions. Therefore, diarrhea is the focus symptom of gastroenterologists on patients with coronavirus infection. It was reported that the prevalence of diarrhoea in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS was 30% and 10.6%, respectively [29] . One study indicated that MERS coronavirus could survive in simulated gastrointestinal fluids and has the ability to infect intestinal organoid models [29] . Hui et al also proposed that SARS-CoV can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route [30] . Furthermore, Zhang et al found that in the later stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the proportion of positive anal swabs was much higher than that of throat swabs [31] . The prolonged existence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in faecal samples was also observed by Wu et al [32] . They found that 55% of COVID-19 patients had anal swab positive results, and the average positive time of throat swab was 16.7 days, while the average positive time for anal swabs was 27.9 days. Importantly, positive staining of viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) could be visualized in the cytoplasm of stomach, duodenum and rectal gland epithelial cells through immunofluorescence [5] . These might provide the basis for virus mutation to obtain fecal-oral transmission capability.",
