Physicians are often better at obtaining medical information than they are at understanding how that information affects the patients.7 Communication contains both verbal and nonverbal interactions.8 A calm atmosphere, relaxed setting, and ample time are essential, particularly when disclosing bad news,9 but even then, a physician with good communication skills should be able to make the patient pleased that she or he saw the physician. This can be accomplished by always stating the truth but by cushioning ominous information with hope. When realistic, the physician might say, for example, that the cancer was caught early, provide reassurance about a probable good outcome, or suggest a new and improved therapy.",

Sometimes this slowing down is so gradual, patients may be unaware or attribute it to aging. Assessing the activity required to bring about the dyspnea is important. How many stairs can be climbed before stopping? How far can someone walk on level ground at her or his own pace without stopping? Does talking on the phone, getting dressed, or eating cause dyspnea?

The essential first step in evaluating a patient with cough is to obtain a thorough history, paying particular attention to the following aspects: acute or chronic, productive or nonproductive, character, time relationships, type and quantity of sputum, and associated features. It is noteworthy that, of the various components of the workup used by the authors of a systematic anatomic investigation to determine the causes of chronic cough, the medical history alone led to the correct diagnosis in 70% of patients.31\n",

For example, the percussion note over a large pneumothorax is hyperresonant and becomes tympanitic when tension is present; in contrast, percussion over a pleural effusion or pneumonia produces dullness, which has been defined as a low-intensity sound of short duration, feeble carrying power, and rather high pitch.66 Flatness is the unresonating sound obtained by percussing over the liver. Three different tonal zones can thus be detected when percussing large pleural effusions: normal resonance above the fluid, dullness in the middle, and flatness when completely below the fluid; these variations in sound may result from the presence of an internal meniscus or fluid wedge, which points upward into the lung above it.

Full contact with the skin is necessary for best listening, which may pose a problem in a patient whose intercostal spaces are sunken from weight loss. In addition, the skin or hairs may brush against the diaphragm and produce a sound that resembles a pleural friction rub. As with examiners' hands, a warm stethoscope head is appreciated by patients. The importance of a quiet room and of applying the stethoscope directly to the skin rather than through clothing has recently been reemphasized.81At times, especially in the intensive care unit, it is not always possible to sit patients up to listen carefully to their backs, which compromises the completeness of auscultation.",

Bronchial breath sounds are loud, high-pitched, tubular, or whistling sounds with expiration as loud as or louder than with inspiration. Bronchial breath sounds are similar to tracheal breath sounds (Audio 16-3), and their presence is the classic auscultatory sign of pneumonia with consolidation. Similar sounds are heard in patients with other types of consolidation, such as pulmonary edema and hemorrhage. The presence of this sign assumes that the sounds originate centrally and reach the chest wall.82\n",

There is general agreement that the brief recurrent detonations that characterize fine crackles are caused by the explosive openings of small airways that had closed owing to the surface forces within them.79, 84 This explains why fine crackles are much more common during inspiration than during expiration and why they are best heard over dependent lung regions\u2014where airways are more likely to close\u2014than over uppermost regions. This is also compatible with the presence of crackles in healthy elderly persons in whom dependent airways close at resting lung volumes. Crackles therefore are best heard during the first deep breaths at the lung bases posteriorly. After several such breaths or intentional coughing, these fine crackles will disappear if the small airways remain open throughout the time the patient is being examined.84\n",

As inspiration progresses, radial traction on airway walls increase until suddenly they pop open.85 Thus crackles heard later in inspiratory time imply that the tension required to open individual airways is greater. Coughing or deep inspiration may change the quality of coarse crackles, such as those associated with underlying alveolar or airway disease, but the crackles rarely disappear entirely. Expiratory crackles are much less frequent than inspiratory crackles and are often seen in obstructive lung disease.83\n",

Wheezes are usually louder than the underlying breath sounds and frequently noted by patients. A leading theory is that wheezes are produced by fluttering of the airway walls and fluid together induced by a critical flow velocity.87 The pitch of the wheeze is dependent on the mass and elasticity of the airway walls and the flow velocity. The degree of bronchial obstruction is proportional to the amount of the respiratory cycle that it occupies. There is no relationship to the intensity or pitch of the wheeze and pulmonary function. Wheezes are well heard over the trachea, and listening over the trachea may be superior to listening over the lung in most asthmatic patients87 (Audio 16-6\n). Wheezing with forced expiration can sometimes be provoked in healthy subjects79 and does not establish a diagnosis of asthma. More helpful is to elicit wheezing and/or coughing at a full expiration without forced effort. Because several disease states are associated with wheezing, additional information should be obtained to make the correct diagnosis.",

Because sounds of central origin are attenuated as they are transmitted peripherally through normal air-filled lung, voice-generated sounds have a muffled quality and the words are indistinct. In contrast, in the presence of consolidation, the characteristics of the sounds are remarkably different. The term egophony (Audio 16-8\n) indicates sounds that have a high-pitched, bleating quality; a change in sound-filtering properties of consolidated lungs accounts for the presence of egophony, which does not require, as often stated, the presence of an overlying pleural effusion. Bronchophony (Audio 16-9) and pectoriloquy (Audio 16-10) both mean that spoken sounds are transmitted with increased intensity and pitch; when each syllable of every word, especially when whispered, is distinct and easily recognized, pectoriloquy is the preferred description. An E-to-A sign means that the spoken letter \u201cE\u201d sounds like \u201cA\u201d while listened to over the lungs.

The hallmarks of clubbing are (1) a softening and periungual erythema of the nail beds, which causes the nails to seem to float rather than to be firmly attached, (2) an increase of the normal 165-degree angle that the nail makes with its cuticle, (3) an enlargement or bulging of the distal phalanx, which may be warm and erythematous, and (4) a curvature of the nails themselves. Of these features, the straightening of the nail cuticle angle appears to be the most sensitive measurement.93\n",

Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (Fig. 16-4\n) is almost always associated with clubbing, particularly in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, other intrathoracic malignancies, and cystic fibrosis. It occasionally develops in patients with bronchiectasis, empyema, and lung abscess but is rare in patients with most of the other conditions in which clubbing has been observed.94 One of the striking features of clubbing is the speed with which it can develop, about 2 weeks in patients with new-onset empyema, and with which it can reverse, also about 2 weeks in patients after corrective cardiac surgery. The presence of clubbing, which was found in 1% of all admissions to an internal medicine department, was associated with \u201cserious disease\u201d in 40% of afflicted patients95; therefore new-onset clubbing always warrants a chest radiograph, and if no abnormality is found, a CT scan to look for a pulmonary neoplasm or other lesion, which may still be localized and curable.",

The most potent stimulus to new capillary growth is hypoxia, which causes an intense production of vascular growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor. With histochemical staining, Atkinson and Fox99 showed increases in vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1, and hypoxia-inducible factor-2\u03b1 along with increased microvessel density in the stroma of clubbed digits. The second common characteristic of patients with digital clubbing is shunting of blood past the capillary bed of either the lung or the liver, which suggests that lack of metabolism of angiogenic factors that bypass a critical organ may be involved. Several of the conditions associated with clubbing have inflammation and shunting, such as bronchiectasis and liver cirrhosis.",
