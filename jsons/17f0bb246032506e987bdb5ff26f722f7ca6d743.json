Because there is currently no specific immunity in the population, humans of all ages and races are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic, and as of Apr 18, 2020, a total of 2,160,207 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 146,088 related deaths had been reported [3] . Diagnosis relies on viral RNA detection by RT-PCR using nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Considering the existence of asymptomatic transmission and false negative results of PCR caused by sampling mistakes or sometimes low viral shedding of the NP [4] , improvement of COVID-19 diagnostic assays are still needed. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the understanding of antibody responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 in patients will be helpful for diagnosis, seroepidemiologic surveys, and pathogenesis studies. In this study, we investigated the humoral immunity of hospitalized patients, analyzed the profile of IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in 41 COVID-19 patients between three and 43 days of their illness.",

As a screening assay for COVID-19 diagnosis, combined nucleocapsid (N) protein and spike (S) glycoprotein were used as coated antigens to increase the sensitivity. The levels of IgG and IgM antibodies were positively correlated with the Relative Luminescence Unit (RLU), and were calculated as AU/mL. Briefly, the serum samples of both healthy patients and confirmed COVID-19 patients were tested. According to the receiver operating curve (ROC curve), the corresponding concentration point of AUC (area under the ROC curve) greater than 0.9 was defined as the cut-off point, and the level of this point was defined as 10AU / mL.",

Although the IgG level of those in the mild and moderate group was still rising on day 28, the IgG response of the critical group was significantly stronger than that of non-critical groups within 4 weeks after illness onset (p=0.0001, Table S3 ). For IgM, the fitting curve of the critical group rose above the cut-off value on day 10, peaked on day 23, then began to decline. However, the IgM levels of non-critical groups rose above the cut-off value as early as day five, peaked on day 16, then dereased. In the majority of the patients, there were antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 during the first three weeks of the disease. The seroconversion time of IgG antibody was earlier than that of IgM antibody (Table S2 and Figure S1 ). The profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was comparable with previous findings of SARS-CoV infections [5, 6] . Li et al., reported that both IgG and IgM antibody levels increased to detectable levels from the second week of illness in 20 SARS-CoV patients [5] .",

            "text": "On the other hand, Park et al., reported that early antibody response was associated with reduced disease severity in MERS-CoV infections [7] . Xu et al., revealed that imbalance of the immune system was a pathogenesis factor from the pathological finding of a COVID-19 case [8] . Here, compared to non-critical groups, we also observed delayed IgG and IgM antibody responses in the critical group ( Figure 1C and 1D). Moreover, the slope of the IgG antibody response was steeper in the critical group (Table S3) , which might be a hint of inflammatory storm. The intervention window might be the second week after illness onset for most patients.",

Firstly, Liu et al. found that acute lung injury in Chinese macaques caused by SARS-CoV could be mediated by higher anti-spike IgG [9] , and we detected high levels of IgG antibody in critical patients. Since we used combined N and S proteins as capture antigen to increase sensitivity of this assay, further studies are needed to separate the effects of specific anti-N and anti-S antibodies. Secondly, we did not test the possible cross-reactivity of our in-house A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 assay with common human coronaviruses (e.g., hCoV-OC43 or others), MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV. No SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infections had been reported by any of the patients in the study, and the infection rate of common hCoV infections has been estimated to be as low as 0.8% in a previous study [10] . Thus, even if the crossreactivity exists, it would have limited impact on the validity of these findings. A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 Figure 1 ",

Given the fact that most of the early cases went to the hospital late (around eight days after illness onset), whose first serum specimens were already positive with SARS-CoV-2 IgG or IgM, seroconversions of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were only observed in 16 (39.0%) and 21 (51.2%) patients, respectively (Figure 1A and 1B). The median time of seroconversion for IgG was 11 days (8 -16) and for and IgM, 14 days (8 -28) after disease onset. On an individual basis, the seroconversion time of IgG antibody was earlier than that of IgM antibody (12.45\u00b14.36 vs. 13.75\u00b14.60 days, p=0.0019,",
