TLR3 is observed in the human myeloid DCs (mDCs), macrophages, natural killer cells, and B cells [6, 16] . TLR3 mRNA has also been detected in epithelial cells of many different organs including airway, uterine, corneal, vaginal, biliary, and intestinal organs because the mucous membranes of these organs act as efficient innate barriers to infection from the respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal and urogenital systems [6, 16] . Surprisingly, higher expression level of TLR3 is also observed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, suggesting a specific function in response to encephalitogenic viruses of the central nervous system [6, 17, 18] . TLRs 7 and 9 are predominantly expressed in plasmacytoid DCs ( pDCs) in humans and are involved in strong IFN-a induction, but TLR8 tends to be detected in human monocytes and mDCs, and predisposes the induction of inflammatory cytokines [1, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . In mice, TLR7 is highly expressed in pDCs, while TLR8 is expressed in all four splenic DC subsets including CD4 \u00fe DCs, CD8 \u00fe DCs, CD4 2 CD8 2 DCs, and pDCs.

In the absence of gp96, TLR7 and TLR9 remain in the ER and gp96-deficient macrophages fail to respond to agonists of TLR7 and TLR9 [35, 36] .

Unc93b1 is also required for cytokine production, up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, and efficient cross-presentation of exogenous antigens via MHC class I and class II molecules [42] [43] [44] . Although the precise mechanism by which Unc93b1 controls each TLR trafficking is yet to be elucidated, it is known that Unc93b1 is essential for the activation of TLRs 3, 7, 8, 9, and 13, and efficient translocation of each TLR from the ER to endosomes [42] [43] [44] . Unc93b1 with an H412R mutation cannot exit the ER and overexpression of Unc93b1 increases trafficking of TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 to endosomes [45] . Furthermore, TLRs 7 and 9, but not TLR3, compete with each other for association with Unc93b1. Under normal circumstances, Unc93b1 physically associates with TLR9, and overexpression of TLR9 inhibits TLR7 signal transduction, resulting in a weaker TLR7 response to RNA.

The importance of autophagy in the regulation of innate immune recognition of pathogens in phagosomes or autophagosomes has been revealed by a number of recent studies. Autophagy is important for the regulation of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs, especially TLR7 [30, 31, [60] [61] [62] [63] . A subset of nucleic acid-sensing TLR ligands, including synthetic nucleic acid-analogs, bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, can induce autophagy. Synthetic nucleic acid-analogs and pathogens are able to induce the formation of phagolysosomes or autolysosomes via fusion of double-membrane vesicles ( phagosomes or autophagosomes) with late endosomes or lysosomes, which are highly acidifying environments containing abundant degradation enzymes. The ligands are then delivered to endosomal compartments where recognition by nucleic acid-sensing TLRs occurs in pDCs, macrophage cells, and B cells [30,31,60 -63] . Although host ssRNAs can also be taken up by macrophages or pDCs during phagocytosis of necrotic cells/infected cells, they rarely reach the endosomal compartments.

In addition, pDCs take advantage of an autophagic process in which 'self' nucleic acids are degraded inside double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes [60] . In the absence of ATG5 in pDCs, type I IFNs cannot be induced in response to CpG-DNA and HSV-1 infection [60] .

Interestingly, the dsRNA bluetongue virus induces the production of a significant amount of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines in pDCs via a MyD88-dependent but TLR7/8-independent signaling pathway [144] . pDCs do not express TLR3 and do not use the RIG-1/MDA5 signaling pathway, however, it is still not known how pDCs respond to dsRNA virus infection [144] .

TLR9 activation by pneumococcal DNA was observed only in cells with live bacterial infection [123] . A recent study reported that TLR9 was important in host defense against M1T1 GAS infections by increasing macrophage hypoxia-inducible factor-1a levels, and oxidative burst and nitric oxide production in response to GAS, contributing to GAS clearance in vivo in both localized cutaneous and systemic infection models [124] . On the other hand, the virulence factor DNase Sda1 of M1T1 GAS has the ability to degrade bacterial DNA and suppress TLR9-dependent INF-a and TNF-a induction [125] . Thus, this is a novel mechanism of bacterial innate immune evasion based on autodegradation of CpG-rich DNA by a bacterial DNase. TLR9 was also shown to be critical for the induction of type I IFNs signaling and the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 in DCs in response to S. aureus, illustrating an additional mechanism through which S. aureus induces the innate immune signaling during infection [126] . One possibility is that bacterial DNA may be delivered to endosomal compartments where acidic conditions ( pH \u00bc 5.5 to 6.2) lead to the degradation of dsDNA containing multiple CpG motif sequences which are recognized by TLR9.

As previously mentioned, 'self'-derived nucleic acids are properly degraded by extracellular and endosomal nucleases before they can be sensed by nucleic acid-sensing TLRs within endosomal compartments under normal conditions. In addition, compartmentalization of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs is important for avoiding contact with 'self'-nucleic acids.
