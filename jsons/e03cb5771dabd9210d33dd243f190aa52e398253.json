Therefore, equal and unequal constraints are solved for many chaotic systems to get its minimized energy function. Nowadays, solving LMIs are used as constraints for Lyapunov function to be minimized has got attention in the field of control theory. A leader-follower based algorithm is proposed by Huang [33] in 2019 for designing observer for quadrotor using consensus static controller. Zhao et. al [34] worked on incremental quadratic constraints for observer based secure communication scheme whereas, amendment in increment multiplier matrix is carried out by Zhang et. al [35] . An adaptive observer [36] , satisfying Lipschitz inequality, based on state estimation is derived using linear matrix inequalities. Apart from continuous time chaotic systems, Zhang et. al [37] worked on discrete-time systems and introduced generalized Luenberger like observer. In 2020, Kaviarasan [38] used fuzzy modelling approach for robust observer based control of multi-weighted complex network systems. Moreover, multiple sensors are used in work of Wen [39] for transmission of data between heterogeneous nonlinear systems. Zhang et. al considered exponential reduced order observer [40] for chaotic systems satisfying incremental quadratic restrictions and its improved version of exponential reduced observer is given in [41] . The issue of transferring data in noise based public Chanel is observed in [42] , while problem of unmatched observer is solved in [43] by Yang. Mostly, humans are interested in robot based technology and the first thing to notice is its dynamics. Besides, many disadvantages of chaos in real life, it has advantages in robotics engineering. A contraction transformation algorithm is proposed for Arnold dynamical system to complete coverage trajectory for mobile robots [44] . In 2016, Li [45] considered Lorenz chaotic system and worked on path planning of robot in bounded region. Nasar presented mobile based robot [46] used for mission of field exploration in 2019, whereas Volos derived a method which is based on microcontroller [47] for fast path coverage of discrete-time chaotic system.",

Furthermore, with the aid of LTspice, a circuit is designed for quadrotor chaotic system which we used in path tracking of robot. After performing several simulations on considered chaotic system, we concluded from Figs. 19 and 20 that second simulation show better results in bounded rectangular region. In future, our target is to design an observer for hyperchaotic systems and will try to implement on RBG images, while in robotics our aim is to implement such targets on real based models which might be helpful in worst conditions such as CoV \u221219 .",
