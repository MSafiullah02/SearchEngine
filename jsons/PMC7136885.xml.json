            "text": "Vaccines and therapeutics are the main weapons deployed to combat infectious diseases. Vaccines have been successful in dramatically lowering infection rates for diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis and many more, and have led to the complete eradication of smallpox and near-eradication of polio 1, 2, 3, 4. However, safe and effective vaccines for some of the most prevalent and crippling diseases known to mankind remain elusive, despite decades of research 5, 6, 7. Against a backdrop of a rise in vaccine hesitancy across the world, the development of effective drug treatments for patients suffering from infectious diseases is imperative [8]. However, drug lead discovery and optimisation for infectious agents can be technically challenging for a variety of reasons: (i) no cell culture or adequate animal model exists 9, 10, 11; (ii) little is known about the biological activity of the agent\u2019s targets; (iii) the agent requires category 3 or 4 containment facilities not available to most academic or industrial researchers and institutions. The 2018 WHO Blueprint List of Priority Diseases is exclusively populated by RNA viruses that fulfil one, two or all three of the criteria mentioned above [12]. Therefore, the development of low containment systems for high-throughput hit discovery has become a necessity.",

            "text": "Small-compound drugs act on proteins involved in the viral life cycle: entry into host cells, virus uncoating, replication and translation of the viral genome or suppression of the innate host immune response. The development of viral pseudotypes and virus-like particles (VLPs) has made research and drug discovery into virus entry and uncoating possible at a reduced containment level 13, 14, 15. By contrast, analysis of subgenomic replicons enables uncoupling of viral replication, transcription and translation from virus assembly, host cell egress, entry and uncoating. Replicons are broadly defined as autonomously replicating DNA or RNA molecules, whereas viral subgenomic replicons are usually produced by deletion of one or more genes coding for structural proteins or insertion of or replacement by a reporter gene and/or selectable marker 16, 17, 18, 19. Replicons have been made possible by the advent of reverse genetics: a process of storage and manipulation of entire viral genomes hosted on plasmids, and the recreation of viral RNA genomes by in vitro or in vivo transcription of these plasmids. In cases where replicons cannot be established, plasmid-driven co-expression of replication factors necessary to drive replication of a reporter RNA create minimal replication systems termed minigenomes. These reporter RNAs usually contain the genomic 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) which are essential for replication, transcription and translation. Whereas most replicons can be maintained in cell lines by antibiotic selection and passed on during cell division, minigenomes based on plasmid transfection have a limited lifespan and need to be recreated before experimentation. Although not exhaustive, Table 1\nlists established replicons and minigenome systems for many medically relevant viruses. Since their conception, replicons and minigenomes have been used in low- and high-throughput screens of compound libraries, to elucidate the biological mechanisms of drug action and to screen for drug escape-mutants arising in the replicon-harbouring cell pool owing to generally poor fidelity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp).",

The HCV genome encodes a polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved by the viral NS3/4A and cellular proteases into the three structural proteins: Core, Envelope protein 1 and Envelope protein 2, and the seven nonstructural proteins: p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. Most HCV strains will not establish productive infection in cell culture and it was not until 2005 that JFH-1 was shown to be the first strain that could be propagated in a cell culture system without adaptive mutations 26, 27. To overcome this limitation, in 1999 Lohmann et al. defined NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B as the minimal set of HCV proteins necessary to facilitate autonomous replication by replacement of the coding region for Core, Envelope protein 1 and 2, p7 and NS2 with a neomycin resistance cassette. Expression of NS3\u2013NS5B was driven by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES), establishing a bicistronic HCV replicon [18] (Fig. 1\na). This development started DAA discovery which eventually led to the licensing in 2011 of first-generation DAAs boceprevir and telaprevir, both NS3/4A protease inhibitors. Replicons were used to assess efficacy and bioavailability of drug candidates, as well as analysis of escape mutants during discovery and optimisation of candidates, reviewed in Refs. 28, 29. However, boceprevir and telaprevir act on HCV genotype 1 only, making development of subgenomic replicons of other genotypes necessary to facilitate discovery of drugs acting on some or all genotypes. To date, subgenomic replicons have been developed for HCV strains 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5a and 6a to ensure testing of pan-genotype effectiveness of drug candidates 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. These replicon systems have aided in the development of second-generation DAAs such as ledipasvir, acting on the viral NS5A regulatory protein, and sofosbuvir, a nucleotide phosphoramidate prodrug inhibiting the NS5B polymerase 36, 37. Without the development of HCV replicons DAA development would have been severely delayed if not impossible and, for the first time in history, patients can now be cured of HCV by DAA combination therapy.",

The polyprotein is then processed by the viral NS2b/3 and cellular proteases into the three structural proteins Capsid, pre-Membrane and Envelope, and the seven nonstructural (NS) proteins NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5, with NS5 harbouring N-terminal methyltransferase and C-terminal RdRp activity. In addition to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs, the first 65 nucleotides of the Capsid coding region contain a hairpin element and the 5\u2032 cyclisation motif, which are essential for replication [39]. A DENV2 replicon was established by Pang et al. in 2001 by deletion of pre-Membrane and Envelope protein coding regions, showing that DENV is amenable to analysis by replicons [40]. Around the same time, replicons were established for closely related viruses like Kunjin, West Nile and yellow fever virus 17, 41, 42. In 2011, selectable DENV replicons harbouring reporter genes were reported by multiple groups. These were constructed by replacement of Envelope or by excision of the coding region from the C-terminal portion of Capsid to the end of Envelope and replacement with a variety of reporter genes, including fluorescent proteins, luciferase and a combination of reporter genes and antibiotic resistance cassettes. In replicons with two foreign genes (e.g., reporter and resistance cassette) translation of nonstructural proteins was driven by an IRES sequence, and translation of the reporter was driven by the viral 5\u2032 UTR. The reporter is separated from the antibiotic resistance by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A autoprotease, enabling post-translational cleavage of the reporter from the resistance marker 43, 44, 45, 46 (Fig. 1b).",

Hernandez-Morales et al. tested a HCV compound library in a high-throughput DENV2 replicon screening assay, identifying JNJ-1A as an effective lead [49]. This publication showed how the subgenomic replicon system can be used to detect drug-induced resistance-associated mutations. In the case of JNJ-1A, resistance-associated mutations were found to cluster in the NS4b coding region. Interestingly, NS4b has no known enzymatic activity but is essential for replication, and is known to interact with viral and cellular proteins to form the dengue replication complex and subvert the cellular innate immune response [50]. Quinic acid derivatives were shown to reduce the amount of NS3 in treated DENV1 and DENV3 replicon-containing cells by FACS analysis [51]. Interestingly, genome replication and translation were excluded as the mode of action for some drug candidates, such as hirsutine, using the dengue subgenomic replicon system [52]. Dengue virus drug discovery is a hotbed of activity as recently reviewed [53]. However, none of the aforementioned drug candidates has been taken to the clinic.",

Abamectin and ivermectin are widely used antihelminthics but no follow-up studies were conducted on their antiviral effect against CHIKV. However, a Phase II/III trial is ongoing to assess safety and efficacy of ivermectin use in DENV infections [65]. In a follow-up study, berberine was shown to inhibit the MAP kinase pathway activated by CHIKV infection, showing that it was effective in alleviating symptoms of CHIKV infection in a mouse model [66]. However, no clinical studies followed. The WEEV replicon has been used in a high-throughput study using a library of 2206 extracts of marine organisms from diverse geographic regions. Thirty-seven primary hits were identified and, from these primary hits, an antimycin A derivative from the marine actinomycete Streptomyces kaviengensis was isolated as the most promising. Antimycin A is a prominent broad-spectrum antiviral that inhibits the cellular mitochondrial electron transport chain and de novo pyrimidine synthesis [67]. Besides drug discovery, togavirus replicons have been modified and successfully used as platforms for the expression of heterologous recombinant proteins and as vaccine platforms 68, 69, 70, 71.",

Therefore, in the mid-1990s a minigenome system was developed based on plasmid-driven expression of the L, N, P and M2 proteins that form a ribonucleoprotein complex within transfected cells, together with an RNA molecule consisting of the leader and trailer sequences of the RSV genome and a region coding for cat (Fig. 1c) [76]. This system was mainly used to elucidate replication and transcription of the RSV genome, although some drug leads were found, including an inhibitor of co-transcriptional RNA guanylylation [77]. In 2011 a true RSV replicon was established by replacing the SH, G and F coding regions with the selectable marker blasticidin S deaminase (bla). The replicon was found to be stable and non-cytopathic in several cell lines. It could be packaged into VLPs by co-expression of structural proteins SH, G and F in trans, and transferred to different cell lines by infection with resulting trans-packaged VLPs (Fig. 1d) [78].",

            "text": "EBOV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The EBOV genome is \u223c19 knt in size and codes for eight major viral proteins: Nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein (GP) and soluble glycoprotein (sGP), VP35, VP40, VP24, VP30 and Large protein (L) [97]. The L protein, harbouring RdRp activity, together with NP, VP30 and VP35, constitutes the ribonucleoprotein complex, with the former three proteins being sufficient for replication, and VP30 essential for transcription [98]. The minigenome system consists of an RNA molecule carrying the native 5\u2032 leader and 3\u2032 trailer sequences of the genome, with an expression cassette inserted in the antisense direction coding for either cat, luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1f) 15, 98. Classically, cells are co-transfected with plasmids coding for L, VP30, VP35 and NP. These cells are then transfected with the in vitro transcribed minigenome RNA, leading to replication and transcription of the minigenome within transfected cells, and ultimately to expression of the reporter gene. Over the years improvements have been made to this system, such as cell lines stably expressing L, NP, VP30 and VP35 to minimise variability introduced during co-transfection of plasmids [99], a selectable marker that is co-expressed with the reporter for creation of a stable cell line continuously replicating the minigenome and T7-polymerase-driven expression of the minigenome within cells transfected with a plasmid coding for the minigenome and T7 polymerase [100].",

Each region coding for a protein is shown as a box in red if the region codes for a structural protein, in yellow if it codes for a nonstructural (NS) protein or in purple if it codes for a nonviral protein. Internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A autoprotease sequences (FMDV2A) are marked by lines or arrows, respectively. For minigenomes (d,f) plasmid-driven expression of viral genes is shown by circularized lines. (a) Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome (ai) and its derived replicon (aii). The HCV replicon was established by replacement of C, E1, E2 and NS2 by the neomycin phosphotransferase (neo). Translation of NS3\u2013NS5B was driven by an IRES sequence. (b) Dengue virus (DENV) genome (bi) and its derived replicons (bii and iii). Replicons for dengue virus have been produced by replacement of the C-terminal part of C, full length prM and the N-terminal part of E with either green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is cleaved by from NS1 by the FMDV2A sequence (bii), or with a polyprotein cleaved by the FMDV2A sequence producing puromycin-N-acetyl transferase (pac) and enhanced GFP (EGFP). Translation of NS1\u2013NS5 is driven by an IRES sequence (biii). (c)Togaviridae genome (ci) and derived replicons for Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (cii and ciii) and Sindbis virus (SINV) (civ). Replicons have been established by replacement of the structural polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) with the polyprotein cleaved by FMDV2A producing pac and EGFP (cii) or an additional insertion of Renilla luciferase (RLuc) within nonstructural protein (nsp) 3 (ciii). The SINV replicon was established by replacement of the structural polyprotein with pac. (d) Respiratory syncytial virus genome (di) and its derived minigenome system (dii) or replicon (diii). The minigenome system was established by tagging the coding sequence of chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (cat) with the 5\u2032 leader and the 3\u2032 trailer sequences of the viral genome and plasmid-driven co-expression of the viral polymerase (L), nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P) and matrix protein 2 (M2). The replicon (diii) was established by deletion of the coding regions of the small hydrophobic protein (SH) and the two glycoproteins G and F, and insertion of GFP at the 5\u2032 end of NS1. (e) Human norovirus (NV) genome (ei) and its derived replicon (eii). The replicon was established by replacement of the majority of the viral protein (VP)1 coding region with neo. (f) Ebola virus (EBOV) genome shown in (+) sense (fi) and its derived minigenome system (fii). The minigenome was established by tagging GFP with the (+) sense 5\u2032 leader and 3\u2032 trailer sequences of the viral genome and plasmid-driven co-expression of the viral polymerase (L), VP30, VP35 and the nucleoprotein (NP).",
