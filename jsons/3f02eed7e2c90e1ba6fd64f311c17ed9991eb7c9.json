This type of leukonychia has been associated with tuberculosis, arteriosclerosis, nephritis, Hodgkin's disease, chilblains, metastatic carcinoma, anemia, and hepatic cirrhosis [1, 2] . Most researchers agree that it is caused by abnormal keratinization [2] [3] [4] . Some [2] postu-Correspondence late that altered vascular patterns of the nailbed or intravascular changes (anemia and hypoproteinemia) may also lead to increased whiteness of the nail. Since our patients were not anemic or hypoproteinemic, we suggest that vasculitis was the cause of leukonychia partialis. Although the heart and coronary arteries are mainly involved in Kawasaki disease, other small and medium-sized arteries may exhibit intimal thickening, round cell infiltration, and, rarely, fibrinoid necrosis [5] . According to Kawasaki et al. [6] an arteritis similar to that seen in infantile periarteritis nodosa and accompanied by coronary thrombosis and aneurysm was found in 13 autopsy cases. We would welcome correspondence from others who have seen nail color abnormalities in Kawasaki disease. troenteritis and age-matched controls for detection of antibody to coronavirus in sera and coronavirus-like particles in stools. Coronavirus-like particles were detected by electron microscopy in 34 (16.3%) of 208 patients and in 3 (1.6%) of 182 controls tested (P < .01), Subsequently, we purified HECVs from stools of two patients (VA24 and VA 35) by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Antisera from mice and guinea pigs immunized with purified virus were examined by conventional immune electron microscopy (lEM) [2] for reactivity to HCV OC43, NCDCV, and the two HECV strains. Results showed a two-way crossreactivity between HCV OC43 and the two HECV strains. The antigenic relatedness to HCV OC43, as well as the typical morphology (figure), suggest that the coronavirus-like particles detected were actually HECVs. Furthermore, the buoyant density of HECV-24 and HECV-35 in sucrose was approximately 1.20 glml, a value in agreement with those reported for human and animal coronavirus. Convalescent-phase sera from all the patients positive for excretion of coronavirus-like particles in stools, and seronegative for previous HCV OC43 infections, reacted by IEM with HECY-24 and HECV-35 and, to a lesser extent, with HCY OC43. Acute-phase sera from the same patients were poorly reactive or nonreactive by IEM. Conversely, Figure 1 . EM appearance of human enteric coronavirus (strain HECV-35).

These rats were shipped in sterile containers. Five rats that were randomly selected and killed immediately upon arrival in our laboratory were subsequently found to have Pneumocystis carinii organisms in their lung tissue. An order placed to the Harlan Sprague-Dawley Company (Indianapolis, Ind) for gnotobiotic rats yielded the same result -all six of the animals shipped were infected with P. carinii. The methods and the results of this serendipitous investigation have been published in detail and should serve as a warning to those who employ \"germ-free\" research animals [3] . The Charles River Company refunded us for their \"germ-free\" rats after I visited their facility and demonstrated appropriate histological techniques for screening for P. carinii. Since then, Dr. Hughes has ascertained that the animals purchased by him for use in his transmission studies [4, 5] were from a different isola-",

Possible routes include (1) undetected lapses in technique employed by the companies, (2) unusual resistance of P. carinii to physical and/or chemical agents, or (3) in utero transmission. Whatever the route, this experience underscores the need for great caution when attempting to reach conclusions based upon experiments conducted in gnotobiotic animals, especially when the companies breeding the animals do not screen for the infective organisms in question.
