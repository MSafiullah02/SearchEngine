            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a major cause of hospital admission in young children and viruses are the most frequent etiological agents involved in such cases [1], [2]. Viral detection techniques have greatly improved in recent years, as the use of molecular diagnostic tests has importantly increased the ability to identify respiratory viruses in children with ARI [3]. Until recently, infection by two or more viral agents concomitantly, in infants and toddlers, was considered an unusual event. However, as these new diagnostic techniques became more readily available in clinical settings, studies have been showing a much higher prevalence of respiratory coinfection [4]. In most of reports, detection of two or more respiratory virus simultaneously ranges from 10 to 30% in pediatric patients [5], [6], [7]. In reports that analyzed respiratory infections by nucleic acid amplification techniques assessing a large number of viruses, such prevalence is higher than 40% [8], [9], [10].",

Main aspects considered for classification are selection bias, study design, confounders, blinding, data collection methods and withdrawals and drop-outs. Overall quality of evidence for all outcomes assessed was done according to GRADE guidelines (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) [22]. As interventional studies to evaluate severity of viral coinfection are not possible, observational studies were considered the highest level of evidence for all outcomes. The overall levels were downgraded according detection of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness and imprecision. Inconsistency was considered serious when substantial heterogeneity was detected (I\n2 greater than 50% or P < 0.01). Serious indirectness was detected when most of studies compared a specific viral combination rather than all coinfections versus all single infections. Imprecision was considered when optimal information size was not met and/or a wide 95% confidence interval (CI) was detected. Disagreements between the review authors over the quality of evidence and risk of bias were resolved by a third reviewer.",

The contribution of coinfection to severity was assessed using risk ratio and 95% (CI) for categorical variables and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous variables. For studies reporting multiple comparisons of virus combinations, all patients and events were joined if such procedure did not carry risk of including the same patients twice. For situations in which such risk was detected and for continuous outcomes, only combination with the largest number of patients was included in meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using I\n2 test. Although serious heterogeneity was regarded as a sign of low quality of evidence, additional sub-groups analysis was considered necessary a priori regardless of heterogeneity. Random effect model were used for pooled OR and MD calculations. If basic required data on results were not presented (e.g.: measures of central tendency) and attempt to contact authors were not successful, the study was excluded from analysis. For articles that presented continuous variable as median, the standard deviation (SD) was calculated from interquartile range (IQ) dividing it by 1.35 if the sample size was considered large and the distribution of the outcome was similar to the normal distribution. In conditions above were not met, study was excluded from meta-analysis [23]. After preliminary analysis considering all included articles, main analysis was performed with studies including minimal set of viruses mentioned above. Analysis was stratified by age in order to assess possible differences in severity in studies including only infants (0\u201323 months), preschool children (0\u201359 months) and all children (0\u201318 years).",
