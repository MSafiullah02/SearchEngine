            "text": "The proliferation of global health actors over the past two decades has produced a dense and diverse landscape of organizations involved in global health governance. Global health governance {GHG} is a set of formal and informal processes, operating beyond state boundaries, through which actors participate in steering, coordinating, and financing collective action on health and disease in populations around the world (Dodgson et al. 2002; Lee and Kamradt-Scott 2014; Ng and Ruger 2011). As a concept, GHG is used both analytically and normatively, referring to processes for health governance in a globalized world, global institutions\u2019 impact on health and its determinants, and arrangements for collectively establishing and meeting global health goals (Lee and Kamradt-Scott 2014). As a system, GHG comprises actors broadly categorized as public/private, state/non-state, or with old/new status, such as: UN agencies, public-private partnerships, philanthropic foundations, NGOs, development banks, think tanks, academic institutions, and governments (Youde 2012; Harman 2012; Clinton and Sridhar 2017a). However, within this evolving GHG scenery wherein non-state and private actors have gained prominence (Hoffman et al. 2015; Ng and Ruger 2011; Szlezak et al. 2010), Ricci (2009) notes that the role of the state has been underemphasized in the contemporary literature.",

Even within the mosaic of funding from new, non-traditional donors (Sch\u00e4ferhoff et al. 2014; Harman and Williams 2014), 73% of official development assistance for health is from states (Moon and Omole 2017). But the state has a critical role to play as a global health governor, beyond that as a global health financier. Schrecker (2012) warns that confining our focus on complex institution building at the global level deters much needed attention from the policy processes and agency of state actors and national governments. The role of the state should not be understood as one that is diminishing relative to that of other actors in the GHG system, but rather it should be understood with regard to its interactions with other actors in the system (Dodgson et al. 2002; Ricci 2009; Davies 2010; Sandberg et al. 2016).",

            "text": "National policies on global health {NPGH} are public policies on global health matters involving collaboration between health and foreign affairs ministries. Switzerland\u2019s Swiss Health Foreign Policy (2019, 2012, 2006) has been identified as the first example of an inter-ministerial agreement adopted on objectives for a national global health strategy (Kickbusch et al. 2007). Other examples include the U.K.\u2019s Health is global: UK Government Strategy (2008), the Norwegian White Paper on Global health in foreign and development policy (2012), Germany\u2019s Shaping global health \u2013 taking joint action \u2013 embracing responsibility (2013), Japan\u2019s Global Health Policy (Okada 2010), and France\u2019s Strategy for Global Health (2017). Descriptions of these global health strategy documents underscore the disposition of diplomacy and policy formulation to integrate heath and foreign policy in multisectoral arrangements for global health at the national level (Kanth et al. 2013; Hein and Kickbusch 2012; Kickbusch et al. 2007), but little is known about how these interact with processes in the GHG system at large outside of global health diplomacy instruments and practices (Ruckert et al. 2016; Kickbusch 2013). Yet, there is nascent knowledge about policy processes to develop such documents (Gagnon and Labonte 2013; Aluttis et al. 2015). A comparison of the NPGH documents adopted in Norway and Switzerland showed that these policies target actors in the GHG system (Jones et al. 2017b). NPGH arenas are multisectoral governing arrangements wherein actors from health, development, and foreign affairs sectors interact in policy action situations to make decisions about the government\u2019s work in global health and its governance (Jones et al. 2017a). Various rules-in-use by actors for micro-processes (e.g. coordination, information sharing, and negotiation) within NPGH arenas establish ranks and relationships of power between different policy sectors interacting on behalf of the state in global health. For example, the rules in the Norwegian NPGH action arena designated a leading role to the foreign affairs sector and a supporting one to the health sector, except in matters concerning WHO affairs (see Appendix A in supplementary material). Alternatively, the Swiss NPGH arena depended on a core group of four sectors that share power in decision-making, with public health as a linking sector between them (see Appendix B in supplementary material).",

The problem is that these relationships may be invisible to global health policy practitioners, in particular when these relationships are built through the involvement of actors from policy sectors other than their own. This relational problem is central to polycentric governance of global health (or other policy regimes of global scope like climate change) because policy development and action at one level may not be independent of a combination of influences (cooperation or competition) from others (Tosun 2017; Gautier et al. 2018). Knowledge about potential interdependencies between global/foreign and national/domestic public policy processes pertaining to GHG may benefit policy scholars and practitioners to learn how national policy-makers from different sectors engage in GHG and where are the interfaces between GHG and national-level decision-making on state action in global health. Based on two in-depth case studies of Norwegian and Swiss NPGH arenas, this paper aims to explore the relationship between processes at national and global decision-making levels on matters of global health.",

Thus, our conceptual framework for this study, based on Real-Dato\u2019s synthetic framework (Real-Dato 2009), positioned external mechanisms of policy change as a directional force from the global arena on to the national one (Jones et al. 2017a). We used literature on how ideas affect policy change to inform our selection and understanding of potential mechanisms by which the global arena influences NPGH policy arenas (Campbell 2002; B\u00e9land 2009). Mechanisms are defined as relational concepts to understand how levels of NPGH and global arenas relate (Falleti and Lynch 2009). We selected policy learning and networking as mechanisms because both suggest that the circulation of ideas and instruments between actors may explain processes for policy change and outcomes of policy change.",

Policy learning refers to using past and current experiences to inform ideas and policy-relevant knowledge of actors for decision-making at the collective choice level (Real-Dato 2009). Policy literature proposes various types of learning such as political, social, policy-oriented, or government learning and lesson-drawing (Bennett and Howlett 1992). Learning objectives reflect different kinds of change for doing policy: procedural (adjustments for organizational change), instrumental (lessons for programmatic change), or systemic (frameworks for paradigmatic change) (Bennett and Howlett 1992; May 1992, 1999; Howlett and Ramesh 2002; Hall 1993). This literature also distinguishes intentional from reactive learning (Bennett and Howlett 1992). For Hall (Hall 1993) learning is deliberate, by questioning previous policy successes or failures and learning from their consequences to adjust policy objectives and tools; whereas for Heclo [cited in (Howlett et al. 2009)] learning is stimulated by the social context and policy environment, which incites a process to adapt and respond to external shifts.",

Based on similar studies (Gagnon and Labonte 2013; Aluttis et al. 2015), we intended to recruit approximately 15 informants per case, including actors from the foreign affairs, health and development policy sectors. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 informants from Norway and 14 from Switzerland between November 2014 and October 2015 (see Table 1). We asked informants about intersectoral policy situations and decision-making processes for NPGH during the period 2006-2012 before the formal adoption of policy documents. In addition to questions about how actors worked together in policy situations, we asked about influences on processes to develop NPGH, and specifically, whether anything from outside of the respective countries exerted influence (i.e. If so, what? Where from? Who or which process contributed it? How was it used?). A diagramming technique for graphic elicitation was used in the face-to-face interviews. With one exception, interviews were recorded (36+ hours of audio) and transcribed verbatim (543 pages of transcripts).

Data on mechanisms of policy change related to external sources of influence (e.g. institutions, ideas, instruments) on the internal policy process of NPGH. Mechanisms of policy change are non-deterministic relational concepts because they are mobile and work differently in different contexts (Falleti and Lynch 2009). Because the study defines policy context as a composite of physical environment and ideational elements, context includes the social, scientific/technical, and political fabric within which actors work. As such, contexts are elements of NPGH arenas, but they also span across boundaries of sovereign jurisdictions and geographical national borders. This has two implications for analysis: we did not analyze outcomes of mechanisms operating in the cases, and we looked for mechanisms of learning and networking in contexts that were relevant from informants\u2019 perspectives for understanding their government\u2019s work in global health, whether inside or outside the national arena.",

The World Health Assembly {WHA} and the WHO Executive Board {EB} were zones of interaction in both cases, appearing linked to reflexive approaches of member states to reorganize their participation in WHO\u2019s governing bodies. During the 2000s, the politicization of the WHA stimulated learning for organizational change to include more senior politicians for authority in delegations. From WHA interactions, the NPGH arenas learned that their WHO delegates needed more diplomatic skills for negotiating, in addition to technical skills related to health and development.There was this idea that it\u2019s an either/or thing. It\u2019s either foreign policy or health policy. Which in the case of WHO is no longer correct. The two spheres have really been blurred\u2026 and it\u2019s crucial that our two ministries work very closely together. It is much more politically driven. Norwegian informant (H)Learning processes in the WHA prompted government innovations in foreign affairs administration, like health expertise for diplomatic posts and WHO liaison staff in permanent missions. In the Swiss arena, learning supported the creation of a health sector desk in the political division of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, nomination of health-dedicated personnel in the Permanent Mission of Switzerland to Geneva, development of health diplomacy training for health attach\u00e9s in embassies, and establishment of Ambassador for Global Health title.When I started, the missions in Geneva had no one specifically trained in or assigned to health.

It really crystallized around the question of Nestle and baby food. Swiss informant (H)The interactions in matters of WHO governance constituted learning processes for the Swiss and Norwegian arenas to reflect on organization and representation of the sectoral dimensions of cooperation in the delegations, and to establish rules for preparing, taking, and administering WHA decisions between sectors that were necessary to manage onsite demands during the assembly. The NPGH arenas in both cases held multisectoral information meetings before each WHA and EB meeting in addition to specific delegation meetings.We have the WHO Forum prior to the WHA in May, the EB in January, and the European Regional Committee in September. We go through the main topics for these WHO meetings and agree on which agency takes responsibility to develop issue papers. We go very strategically through the agenda, prioritizing items, so people going to the meetings are well prepared when it comes to the topic\u2019s background and questions, and with the Norwegian position. Norwegian informant (H)Similarly, in the Swiss arena, learning in this interactive space triggered processes for defining united positions in advance, rather than assembling a collection of sectoral ones. This represents a major shift from the preparatory processes for WHA before the coordinated approach was institutionalized through the Swiss arena.We did not even have a preparatory meeting in Bern before the WHA. We just went to Geneva and the different parts of the delegation met in the hall before the assembly started. And then, sometimes we realized that we had major issues where we disagreed. That was very difficult because someone had to call the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about what to do. Swiss informant (H)From the Swiss arena\u2019s perspective, the WHO governing bodies are interactive spaces for policy-oriented learning because governing bodies validate and circulate global norms for national adaptation. As one Swiss informant (FA) said, \u201cthe WHO agenda strongly influences the priority topics\u201d deliberated in the Swiss arena. The agendas of formal meetings of interdepartmental groups also included topics from international organizations for which health is not the focus, such as World Intellectual Property Organization.",

Global health initiatives use public-private partnership models to advocate, fund, and/or implement interventions for disease-specific programs. Networking of political and knowledge elites in international organizations was formative for their interactions in public-private partnerships for health where learning increased political capital in the Norwegian arena.Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, who later became Minister of Foreign Affairs, was Gro H. Brundtland\u2019s right hand in WHO. At the same time Jens Stoltenberg\u2019s appointment to GAVI\u2019s board (2001-2005) was facilitated. So when Stoltenberg became the Prime Minister (again in 2005), he had been a GAVI board member, bringing that sphere with him and all the low-hanging fruits of success from putting money into vaccines for saving children. Norwegian informant (FA)The involvement of Norwegian politicians in the governance of global health initiatives like GAVI connected policy learning directly to the political context of the Norwegian arena. Using elite networking to help place Norwegian politicians (i.e. Jens Stoltenberg and Dagfinn H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten) into such roles also supported policy learning useful for them in Norway. H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten, elected as a Board member of GAVI in 2006 (replacing Stoltenberg who became Prime Minister in 2005), was Chair of the GAVI Board from 2011-2015 during which time he was also a member of the Parliament\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Defense Standing Committee from 2006-2013 and its spokesperson for the public hearing and committee\u2019s opinion on the White Paper in the Norwegian arena.H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten played a crucial role in ensuring a cross-spectrum support in the Parliament for this White Paper, but in doing that, he also had a lot of power in ensuring that perspectives other than those initially presented in the White Paper became substantial. Norwegian informant (CS)The complex relationships of the Norwegian arena to interactive zones in the governance of institutions such as the Global Fund, UNAIDS, GAVI were intensified due to Norway\u2019s role in their establishment. New forms of interaction with the international context of global health sprouted from the Norwegian arena\u2019s direct and intentional modification of the GHG institutional landscape.It\u2019s circular because we were a big actor in setting up those funds. From that perspective, they were partly created as tools for our political priorities. We didn\u2019t just orient towards them after they existed. And now that they are there and are doing well and giving good results, they are still our priorities. Norwegian informant (FA)",

            "text": "Both arenas used formal and informal transgovernmental arrangements as interactive forms for learning. An annual retreat hosted by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) in Glion prior to the WHA (2004-2011) constituted the most informal form of interaction combining elite networking and policy learning. The Head of International Affairs at the FOPH initiated this meeting between senior international affairs administrators from Ministries of Health and health experts from OECD countries to facilitate exchanges of policy ideas and experiences, creating a space for policy-oriented learning about GHG between health actors from high-income countries. For example, the idea for a WHO Committee C proposal emerged from Chatham House rules discussions in Glion.On an informal basis, in terms of the issues [for the Swiss Health Foreign Policy] - a lot came out of discussions with a selection of OECD countries assembling in this little village. Some said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work yet,\u201d or, \u201cWe would like to have such a thing, but what\u2019s your experience with that?\u201d We found some had a paper, but not many tools. Some had tools of collaboration in place, but they hadn\u2019t [officially] formalized it as a government decision. Swiss informant (H)The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs {MFA} founded the Foreign Policy and Global Health {FPGH} initiative, a more formal diplomatic arrangement for cooperating with ministries of foreign affairs in France, Senegal, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, and Thailand. The FPGH initiative functioned as an interactive zone between the Norwegian arena and MFA counterparts to collectively reflect on health from a foreign policy perspective. As put by a Norwegian informant (FA), it was \u201ca turf on its own that we used when we saw that it was smart \u2026 which is as important as pouring money on specific things.\u201d The FPGH espoused a \u201cplatform of trust\u201d, a protected space for dialogue among peers in countries from northern and southern hemispheres. By networking with actors who were not based in health ministries, it created opportunities to work \u201cflexibility and strategically\u201d on health in the foreign affairs policy community.[T]he design with these seven countries across regions and alliances was unique, as an initiative without a permanent secretariat and no website. It was based on people, trust, and mutual interests. \u2026 People could come together, air disagreement and have discussions. It was a really good place to talk about definition of concepts and issues like global health security. Norwegian informant (H)Policy learning from this FPGH initiative enhanced the Norwegian arena\u2019s understanding of health issues in foreign policy terms, and this learning supported action in institutions for GHG. One policy-oriented learning outcome of the FPGH was an annual UN General Assembly resolution on FPGH and reports to the UN Secretary General which concretized commitments taken among the group of seven and increased their visibility on a global platform. The group selected a topic annually for focus in these global statements, and FPGH members transferred them to their domestic policy contexts for the MFA to reflect them in their own foreign policy agendas.That involved connecting health to different parts of the MFA. This year, the focus for the UN General Assembly resolution has been security of health workers, so we work really closely with the humanitarian section, which also has this as a priority. And if it was environment and climate, as it was one year, we do it together with our colleagues in the climate section. Norwegian informant (FA)The most formal transgovernmental interactions of the Swiss arena with the international context took the form of bilateral arrangements. Swiss NPGH actors had frequent bilateral discussions with countries that were developing similar national strategies or experimenting with health diplomacy instruments related to GHG. Bilateral relationships with countries that shared approaches and values for global health policy provided opportunities for regular meetings to share lessons learned and examples of other\u2019s successes and challenges.",

Then everything is brought together within WHO. There, we take positions, we learn if we were successful and why we were not successful, and what should be changed in the future to be more successful. The missions in Geneva organize many issues on global health governance. This is our learning field. That\u2019s why we are also very proud to have all these actors in Geneva because this is an incredible opportunity for Switzerland to influence the global thinking on global health. That\u2019s our playground somehow. Swiss informant (D)One way the Swiss arena optimized this hub was via working lunch seminars. The Swiss Interdepartmental Working Group on Intellectual property, Innovation and Public Health holds these before its formal meetings, inviting international experts to present alternative policy options that stimulate discussion and inform decision-making of the group.

Their careers of over 40 years evolved with the changes from tropical medicine, to international health, to global health as a policy field. Their work \u201con the frontlines\u201d of global health practice, research, and governance contributed directly to building the international profile and presence of Norway in GHG, simultaneously constructing pillars of the Norwegian arena.The White Paper on Global Health sums up many years of policy, of activities, and of networking.

Norwegian informant (FA)The Norwegian arena capitalized on their personal and professional networks, knowledge and ideas. Their careers took them from working in the field in resource-poor countries to political appointments to international organizations.He\u2019s been very influential in terms of the direction and the impact of Norwegian global health policy \u2013 first, by virtue of his scientific approach and institutional experience, not least at the international level. Second, because he is very strategic. Not only within this field, but across fields. Norwegian informant (D)Each had direct contact with ministers, and they regularly briefed senior administrators who were responsible for connecting their strategic efforts and practical considerations in the Norwegian arena.They were building and maintaining networks and linking people working at different levels, knowing how to pull on the good people around them\u2026 that map of politicians, before they came into position and when they were in position, the political background and networking tied around these two persons. That\u2019s a pretty important piece of that puzzle. Because without it, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are with the White Paper now, because we wouldn\u2019t have had that political commitment to it in this ministry. Norwegian informant (FA)In the Swiss arena, one boundary spanning knowledge elite was critical for connecting Swiss state actors to the international level. She was a significant knowledge broker and partner of the Swiss arena on whom it relied for expertise in health diplomacy and foreign policy. Her personal and professional connections built through her career and years of experience in policy, academia, and international health institutions like WHO, made her an asset to the Swiss arena as a \u201cfacilitator\u201d.She wrote articles and had a lot of contact [with FOPH]. Apart from our steady contact with her, she was going around the world, giving conferences on global health policies and issues. We also got the feedback from that side. She was our intellectual partner. Swiss informant (FA)She especially bridged the Swiss arena with epistemic and policy communities in the external context. The establishment of the Global Health Program at the Graduate Institute in Geneva constituted a fundamental networking and learning arm for the Swiss arena; many Swiss health attach\u00e9s and diplomats have been educated there. The development of the health diplomacy training established the Graduate Institute as a key stakeholder of the Swiss arena for policy dialogues with international experts in Geneva about GHG issues.",

Connective forms [F4, F5] are ontologically different from other structures in our findings, and they are rarely discussed in these terms in GHG literature. Both cities [F4] and transnational knowledge elites [F5] were forms of interactions important for consolidating learning and networking from institutional forms [F1, F2]. Boundary spanning, a term from organizational science and administration, generally refers to practices for reaching across diverse structural divisions to benefit inter-organizational collaboration and improve complex problem management. Researchers and practitioners have argued that global health practice needs boundary-spanning approaches to work more inclusively across contexts and structures (e.g. professional, sectoral, geographical) (Sheikh et al. 2016). In our findings, we refer to boundary spanning [F5] as a form of interaction via the work of senior transnational knowledge elites whose global health careers produced extensive personal and professional networks world-wide. They are skilled networkers and strategists (not necessarily working in government), dedicated \u201creticulists\u201d and \u201centrepreneurs of power\u201d (Williams 2002) with vast international experience and thick address books, who broker learning and relationships between policy-makers, funders, institutions, and epistemic communities. State actors in NPGH arenas use boundary spanning transnational knowledge elites to help them analyze and navigate the complexity of the GHG system [F5]. Through meta-networking, these elites link salient learning and relationship-building from diverse interactions in translational spaces back to politicians and policy practitioners in national institutions.",

This may be due to the flexibility or autonomy that informality offers NPGH actors to interact with actors from different sectors within the GHG system. Our findings showed that policy learning and networking were both operating in most forms [F2-F5], although learning was the only mechanism in data related to interactions in WHO governance [F1]. The procedural and instrumental foci of learning in the WHO governing bodies was a mixture of deliberative, based on delegations\u2019 planning, and reactive, responding to shifts in the WHO policy environment also linked to systemic perturbations of public health crises (e.g. SARS, H1N1 swine influenza). Learning and networking processes appeared more interconnected in other forms of interaction [F2-F5] especially when networking processes are used informally to improve access to experts or policy communities and expand reach of learning processes [F4, F5].",

(2014) who empirically define GHG as a \u201cprocess of change and adaptation and as an arena where actors, institutions, and ideas interact\u201d. Interactions between state and non-state actors from different levels of policy and governance are characteristic of the transnationalization of public policy (Stone 2004). Transnationalization pertains to relationships between actors and sectors functioning outside the traditional frameworks of international relations, and it refers to frames of reference (e.g. policy regimes, networks) relating social and geographic spaces across multiple localities, diverging from ideas of national and global spaces as concentric spheres (Pries 2009). While our results focus on forms of interaction, exploring the transnational nature of NPGH arenas calls for a discussion of agents in interactions. Stone identifies three types of \u201ctransnational policy community\u201d individuals who circulate ideas, procedures, and instruments (Stone 2008). The \u201cinternationalized public sector official\u201d operates in institutions and networks [F1, F2, F3, F4] based on authority from their official positions within their state. The \u201cinternational civil servant\u201d works in the secretariat of international organizations and global public-private partnerships [F1, F2, F4]. The \u201ctransnational policy professionals\u201d are policy and practice pundits (i.e. consultant, foundation officer, scientific expert, NGO executive) [F2, F4, F5]. Transnational policy professionals impact the circulation of policy learning through networks and modify the geographies of governance (Prince 2012; Marx et al. 2012). The boundary spanning transnational knowledge elites identified in our two cases [F5] are a hybrid combination of all three types of individuals in the transnational policy community for global health due to their careers. We would add to Stone\u2019s categories that of the \u201ctransnational capital class\u201d of corporate elites (Carroll and Carson 2003) that interact with NPGH and the GHG system in global public-private partnerships and product development partnerships (i.e. pharmaceutical industry) [F2, F4] (see (Rushton and Williams 2011; Kenworthy et al. 2016) for examples).",

Transnational interactions contribute to reaffirming state actors as intrinsic to the system. States with NPGH arenas receive recognition as integral actors in the GHG system, beyond institutional membership or donor status. The intersectoral collaboration developed within NPGH arenas aims to improve state influence in the transnational arena for GHG. Indeed, networks across state institutions and the reconfiguration of responsibilities of state agencies to include governance of issues at the international level are examples of how global governance transforms internal governance arrangements (e.g. NPGH) to perform GHG as part of the domestic arena (Hameiri and Jones 2015). Based on cases of NPGH in select high-income countries, the domestic resources for such transformations to construct NPGH arenas are not likely afforded by lower-middle or low-income countries. Furthermore, actors from these countries may be excluded from informal elite networking processes in transgovernmental and connective forms of interaction unless those forms actively build capacity for equitable representation and inclusive participation supported by skills for global health diplomacy and health in foreign policy (Adisasmito et al. 2019).",

            "text": "The exclusion of other mechanisms of policy change, such as conflict expansion and venue shopping, are limits to the study\u2019s findings regarding forms of interaction. These types of mechanisms affect change in public policy (often in agenda-setting processes) through framing strategies to modify a policy image in order to render the policy issue more appealing or meaningful to different audiences or to propose different instruments for addressing it. We excluded these mechanisms because they are generally associated with the global governance of particular health or disease issues (i.e. HIV/AIDS, pandemics, antimicrobial resistance). Related to this point, global issues networks were absent from our data and results. Such networks have been shown to be influential in advocating issues for global health policy and practice, including helping raise political priorities (Shiffman et al. 2016; McDougall 2016; Smith and Shiffman 2016). Our observations about boundary spanning networking practices that operate at the intersections of GHG hubs and the personal networks of transnational elites from national arenas might explain why such formal global health networks are absent. These networks may represent other forms of interaction between national and global processes governing global health. However, given the focus of our study on cases of the intersectoral NPGH arena, such interactions with issue networks may be either via national civil society organizations who are observers in NPGH, through sectoral arrangements specific to health institutes or subordinate agencies, or in intersectoral arrangements at the programmatic/operational level (rather than policy governance/collective choice level). The interaction and power rules-in-use for the policy action situations in each case determined the status of civil society organizations, non-governmental organizations and academics in the NPGH arenas in Norway and Switzerland (see Appendices A and B in supplementary material). We interviewed key informants mainly from government sectors in the policy arena, as they were represented and involved in multiple action situations. This focus on actors from government policy sectors may have limited critical perspectives collected from informants on the policy process.",

The formal and informal interactions between NPGH arenas and GHG construct an interdependent relationship between the policy processes within NPGH arenas and GHG system. These ties are formed through the circulation of ideas in policy learning and networking processes between state and non-state actors in institutions and networks. Thus, NPGH arenas appear to have fuzzy boundaries as a policy process, with their borders drawn by extent and type of their interactions with the GHG system. Based on these findings, the characterization of NPGH arenas as transnational governance of global health introduces a nuanced perspective to understand intersectoral governance arrangements of states as actors of GHG.\n",
