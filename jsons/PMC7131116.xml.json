However, suicide only accounts for a small proportion of deaths in older people; in contrast it is among the three leading causes of death in those aged 15\u201344 [1]. Self harm was ranked 13th in the all-age global causes of death in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study, but in old age it was ranked much lower to be 17th at age 60\u201364 and by age 80 years and over it was ranked 32nd [3].",

Rapid population ageing worldwide and the recognition that factors associated with suicidal behaviour vary across the life cycle are drawing attention to this deficit.",

In a study of general practice patients aged 60 years and over, the presence of suicidal ideation was associated with nearly 34 times increased risk of attempted suicide in the previous year [9]. A study of 97-year olds found that 77% of those acknowledging suicidal feelings did not meet criteria for depression [10] and a qualitative study found that older people with a wish to die originally developed thoughts about death as a positive solution to life events or adverse circumstances [11]. There is also evidence that suicidal thoughts in older people are associated with increased risk of mortality by natural causes [12].",

            "text": "Impulsive suicide attempts have long been reported in older people with frontal executive dysfunction secondary to early dementia or mild cognitive disorders [13]. Most research into cognitive function, however, has focussed on older people with major depression with and without a history of suicide attempts. In a preliminary investigation for a series of case\u2013control studies, poor performance on tests of executive function, attention, and memory were found to be associated with suicidal behaviour in older people with major depression [21]. Subsequent findings distinguishing older depressed suicide attempters from those without a history of suicidal behaviour included a perception of life problems as threatening and unsolvable and an impulsive approach to problem solving [22] and a tendency to ignore past experiences and neglect outcome probability when making decisions that are overly present-focused [23], [24]. A second research group found that older depressed suicide attempters have worse cognitive inhibition performance, especially on the motor component, than their non-suicidal depressed counterparts and this inability to inhibit intrusive information may predispose to suicide attempts [25]. There is also an inability to inhibit neutral information access to working memory and delete irrelevant information which may impair the capacity to respond adequately to stressful situations [26].",

Vascular disease may predispose to late onset depression and this often has midlife antecedents such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. A case\u2013control of suicides over age 50 years found that cerebrovascular risk factor scores were significantly higher in suicide cases [29]. It is unclear whether physical illness has an independent effect upon suicide risk and studies are inconsistent about the role of specific illnesses [13]. Some physical illnesses including cancers and thyroid disorders can cause depression and these might not be detected until after a suicide attempt. Chronic pain, breathlessness and functional impairment are frequently reported health features [13], with one study finding that the risk of suicidal ideation increased with pain severity and lack of pain control, particularly in men [30]. Psychological reactions may result in some people feeling overwhelmed by their health problems. Physical vulnerability also increases the risk that an older person will succumb to a suicide attempt. For example, an analysis of suicide attempts recorded in the National Trauma Data Bank in the United States from 1995 to 2002 found that mortality was higher in older people [31].",

The role of anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, is unclear with some studies finding an increased risk though it seems usually in the context of mixed anxiety/depressive states [5], [13], [45]. In one large population-based study from Denmark, the highest risk of suicide was in those hospitalised with a reaction to stress and adjustment disorder [42]. This is consistent with the observation that the increased suicide rate in older people in Hong Kong during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was related to their stress over fears they would be a burden on their family [46]. Alcohol abuse is less frequently implicated in old age compared to younger suicides and often has comorbid depression [7], [13]. Personality disorders are less common in suicidal behaviour in late life compared with younger cohorts [7], [13]. There appears to be a slight increased risk associated with dementia and this mainly happens in people under the age of 70, with comorbid depression and within three months of diagnosis [42], [47].",

It recommended a range of universal (entire population), selective (high risk populations), and indicated (symptomatic individuals) strategies that could be considered. As no single prevention strategy is likely to be successful alone, a multi-faceted, multi-layered approach to suicide prevention is required. Consistent with this, an evaluation of national suicide prevention programmes in 21 OECD countries concluded that suicide rates declined after government-led suicide prevention programmes were introduced and that this was more pronounced in youth and older people [49].",

These studies included a series of quasi-experimental studies in rural Japanese communities with high suicide rates, which involved community-based depression screening in older people and psychoeducation with follow up of screen positives by GPs or psychiatrists, demonstrated reduced suicide rates in women but not men [51]. Recently a multimodal intervention which included involvement of local government leadership, education of the general public to reduce stigma and increase awareness, training programmes for community gatekeepers and screening and increased support for individuals at high risk, was found to be effective in reducing suicidal behaviour, particularly suicide attempts in males and older people in rural areas, but was ineffective in highly populated regions [52].",

In terms of better understanding suicidal behaviour, work in recent years has made progress in identifying the neurocognitive differences between suicidal and non-suicidal depressed older people along with associated structural differences on neuroimaging. It is unclear whether these neurocognitive factors also play a role in suicidal behaviour in the absence of depression. This holds promise for future research.",

How best to improve the quality of depression management in primary and secondary care requires further research. Further work is also required to examine if enhancement of social connections is beneficial. Currently the Senior Connection, a randomised trial of volunteer peer companionship for older people involving community-based social services agencies and primary care practises, is underway in the United States [59]. Effective suicide prevention in a population, however, is likely to require a multi-layered multi-faceted approach. Further research is required regarding the optimal way of delivering such interventions particularly in urban populations and for males.",
