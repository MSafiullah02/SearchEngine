It is not surprising, therefore, that a robust, vigorous, and rapidly responsive immune defense system has evolved over millennia of exposure to diverse and increasingly sophisticated microbes. In addition, air-borne irritant particulate matter such as allergens, biopersistent fibers such as asbestos and combustion-derived nanoparticles (e.g., diesel exhaust particles) must be overcome to maintain a high level of function. The architecture of the respiratory system provides a first layer of defense against air-borne microorganisms and particulate matter, effectively blocking the lower airways from anything greater than 5 \u03bcm in diameter. Inhaled air is warmed and filtered through the nasal hair and nasopharyngeal passages before negotiating the larynx (which ordinarily prevents any intrusion from matter destined for the gastrointestinal system and allows phonation) down the large tubular trachea and into the upper bronchi. The initially large bronchial airways repeatedly bifurcate until they reach an extremely narrow gauge and form alveoli at which point gas exchange with the capillary network that lines the alveolar wall becomes possible. Pseudostratified columnar-ciliated epithelium predominates in the trachea and bronchi forming the mucociliary escalator. Any intruding microorganism or misplaced particulate matter slipping out of the air stream in the upper airways is trapped in the muco-ciliary escalator and forced up and out by the regular beating motion of the respiratory cilia.",

The respiratory mucosa has developed a sensitive and specific recognition strategy that allows it to identify microbe-specific protein patterns such as lipopolysaccharide, lipotechoic acid, formylated peptides, flagellin, and non-methylated DNA. Once detected, these galvanize resident alveolar macrophages and initiate a variety of proinflammatory pathways that instigate the classical elements of inflammation (calor (heat), rubor (redness), dolor (pain), tumor (swelling), and loss of function as described by Celsus and (debatably) Virchow)2 driven by increased vascular permeability leading to a proteinaceous infiltrate and leucocyte recruitment. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate most of this form of recognition and though they each have a specific role, TLRs can function in unison to expand their powers of recognition.3 Resident alveolar macrophages deal with the majority of insults that trigger this alert system but if they are overwhelmed recruited leucocytes including granulocytes lend assistance.",

They are then ingested (phagocytosed) by neutrophils or, if they should prove resistant to this because of size or learned subversion, are subjected to a chemical onslaught (exocytosis) as neutrophils forcibly externalize toxic granule substances such as lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS).4, 5 A subset of neutrophils (and other leucocytes potentially6) employs web-like neutrophil extracellular traps to ensnare and kill resistant organisms but must themselves die in the process.7 In beneficial neutrophil-dominant inflammation, the organisms or foreign particles are detected and phago-cytosed by neutrophils, which then undergo an organized, non-provocative programmed cell death (apoptosis) that promotes their own recognition and removal by macrophages or dendritic cells. At this point, the interface between the innate and adaptive immune systems occurs as macrophages, which migrate to the lympho-reticular system following ingestion of apoptotic neutrophils, act as antigen-presenting cells allowing the lymphocyte population to complete the resolution and remembrance process. The next time this particular organism is encountered a preprepared, specific response should be available to ensure it has less opportunity to make an impact.8",

This response has no obvious beneficial effects and it is still unclear why it should occur. The eosinophil is a useful and active defender against parasitic infection and has an armament specific to that end. It has been noted that as parasitic infections have been largely eradicated in Western society, the incidence of this abnormal eosinophil response (termed allergy or atopy) has increased and it seems that eosinophilic inflammation occurs almost as an outlet for redundancy.1",

In pulmonary infection, this may occur because a microorganism can subvert host defense by surviving either within inflammatory cells (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or inside a protective micro-environment (Pseudomonas aeruginosa).11, 12 Persistent inflammation may occur because of a recurrent stimulus like tobacco smoke (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), allergens (asthma), or long (>20 \u03bcm) biopersistent fibers (asbestosis).13 Inflammation is also chronic where the host immune system malfunctions and becomes under- or overactive or misdirected as occurs in autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis), immune deficiency syndromes (chronic granulomatous disease, severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome), cystic fibrosis (CF), or adult respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury (ARDS/ALI). In some cases, the etiology is unknown and subject to debate (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)). Regardless of the cause, it is apparent that the over-recruitment, ineffective clearance, and hence accumulation and misdirected or frustrated activation of neutrophils and eosinophils lead to tissue damage and an inciting feedback loop of inflammation that perpetuates chronicity13 (Figure 1).",

This cell differen-tiates into a common granulocyte progenitor cell, which when given appropriate stimulation can produce any granulocyte lineage. Potential granulocyte lineages include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Basophils are the least well studied and least numerous of the granulocytes, and their physiological function seems to overlap somewhat with that of eosinophils. They are probably meant to counter parasites but their relevance to Western society is in the production of numerous medi-ators necessary for the incitement of the asthmatic response. Neutrophils and eosinophils are discussed in greater detail below. Granulocytes are terminally differentiated and having therefore exited the cell cycle, they remain in the G0 phase of growth for the duration of their lives. However, a recent report suggests that postmitotic neutrophils are capable of radical pheno-typic switching to take on major characteristics of macrophages when stimulated with growth factors, whereas another study shows that mouse neutrophils can be switched to a dendritic cell phenotype following in vitro incubation with colony-stimulating factor-1.14, 15 Extravasated granulocytes recruited to the tissues ought to die by apoptosis whilst non-migratory, circulating granulocytes are removed by the combined efforts of the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. There is renewed interest in granulocyte life cycle and differentiation as pharmaco-logical inhibitors of the cell-cycle machinery have been shown to promote granulocyte apoptosis.16, 17",

They survive in the circulation for approximately 7\u201310 h but if compelled by inflammatory circumstance or chemical persuasion can extend their life span up to 48 h and beyond. This population turnover requires efficient production by the bone marrow and prompt clearance by that same organ with help from the spleen and liver. Neutrophils possess at least four different types of granules termed: primary (azurophilic), secondary (specific), gelatinase, and secretory; each carries a specific arsenal of toxic chemicals that the neutrophil uses against non-host elements. The neutro-phil is a key effector cell at the front line of immune defense and is efficacious (and lifesaving) in the majority of instances because of its versatility. Neutrophils prove to be effective phagocytes because on accomplishment of this task they are programmed to die a prompt, quiet and importantly, contained, apoptotic death. This limits the time available to internalized microorganisms and prevents hijacking of cellular controls to enable subversion (as is thought to occur when M. tuberculosis is internalized by macrophages18). This timely death also signals larger scale phagocytes such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells to initiate a phagocytic response. If a neutro-phil is unable to phagocytose an invader then it will disgorge granule contents into the surrounding environment causing tissue damage and amplifying the inflammatory response. This should not be construed as a purely detrimental response as it serves to block potential routes of entry for invading orga-nisms as tissue damage causes capillary shutdown and collapses lymphatics, sends a strong signal of imperiled defense, and allows time for an alternative immune strategy to be adopted.8",

It is becoming appreciated that there is a false division between the innate and adaptive immune response systems and that a more realistic model involves a continual interplay between constituents of these systems.

They may survive for up to 12 h in the circulation but have the ability to extend their longevity to over a week if required. Not only are they bigger than neutrophils but they also wear more flamboyant colors when stained by the Romanowsky method (methylene blue and eosin), which accounts for their name. Eosinophils may also be distinguished by their production of Charcot\u2013Leyden crystals (manufactured from lysophospholipase, an eosinophil-derived enzyme), which are often visible in their cytoplasm. Eosinophils, like neutrophils, are supplied with numerous granules though their constituents differ including major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin. This array is certainly capable of tissue damage and probably evolved to combat helminthic infection. Increasingly, new roles for eosinophils are being identified and it seems likely that they have a role in combating viral infection as eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin have been shown to degrade single-stranded RNA viruses. They are said to play an early role in innate immunity by production of important cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 though this is probably only physiologically important in the gastrointestinal tract. They can also modulate adaptive immunity by specific activation of T cells.20",

These drugs extend neutrophil life span but promote eosinophil apoptosis. This effect seems to correlate with their ability to upregulate Mcl-1 in neutrophils but downregulate the same protein in eosinophils.41 Dexamethasone has also been shown to promote macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils.42 The impact of putative inflammation-resolving agents on clearance of apoptotic neutrophils is of paramount importance as prompt removal is essential to avoid secondary necrosis and loss of toxic contents. This is perhaps why the discovery of a new class of endogenous lipid-derived proresolution agents has been so exciting. The lipoxin family produced by neutro-phils and macrophages limits the recruitment of neutrophils to inflammatory sites and enhances macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. This occurs as part of a natural brake on progression of inflammation and there is hope that enhancement of this pathway may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to counter inflammatory disease, a hypothesis that has already shown promise in several animal models.43 Another exciting prospect for therapeutic modulation of granulocyte apoptosis has emerged with the discovery of active cell-cycle machinery in neutrophils, which can be inhibited to promote apoptosis. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor drugs promote neutro-phil apoptosis and drive resolution of inflammation in animal models. Given that these drugs are already in use for the treatment of cancer, it is possible that they could make the transition from bench to bedside for the management of inflammatory disease in the near future.17, 44",

            "text": "In normal healthy lungs, the predominant alveolar leucocyte is the macrophage, a cell that becomes resident following differentiation from a bone marrow-produced circulating precursor monocyte. Alveolar macrophages occupy a unique position at the interface between inhaled air (and hence the external environment) and the circulation (in the form of the alveolar capillary network, which is closely juxtaposed to the alveolus to promote efficient gaseous exchange) and because key macrophage functions include chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and cytotoxi-city they are lynch pins of immune defense. Importantly, during pulmonary infective or inflammatory disease, a key role in resolution of inflammation falls to both alveolar and recruited circulating macrophages. These cells are responsible for the removal of apoptotic neutrophils and to some extent eosinophils (though epithelial cells may be equally important for eosinophil removal) by efferocytosis. In order for an apoptotic cell to be recognized by a macrophage it must display specific signals. The most obvious change in the apoptotic granulocyte's plasma membrane is the externalization of phosphatidylserine residues but this in itself is not sufficient to expedite phagocytosis. The search for a macrophage-docking receptor on granulocytes has been exhaustive but inconclusive and currently a combination of various glycoproteins and phospholipids is of postulated importance. These putative receptors include the recently identified Tim,5, 45 stabilin-2,46 and BAI1.47 The process of efferocytosis, literally meaning \u201cburying the dead\u201d, is a proresolution strategy in itself. Macrophages that consume apoptotic neutrophils switch to a resolution phenotype that allows them to secrete TGF-\u03b2 and IL-1048 as opposed to proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. This is in contrast to macrophages that have consumed necrotic neutrophils where the opposite is true and inflammation is actively propagated. In addition, the proresolution phenotype includes the production and enhanced responsiveness to lipoxins, protectins, and resolvins. These mediators enhance macrophage phagocytosis and promote proresolution cytokine production.43",

The highest concentrations of neutrophils are found in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) (which is perhaps representative of rapid airway-directed migration) but numbers of neutrophils are also increased in lung parenchyma and airway smooth muscle. Neutrophilic inflammation is characteristic of COPD exacerbations and there is a correlation between the resting burden of lung-based neutrophils and seve-rity of disease phenotype. Neutrophilic inflammation appears to be driven by the irritant force as smoking drives alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells to express increased levels of IL-8, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant. IL-8 also stimulates neutrophils to release myeloperoxidase whereas TNF-\u03b1 and leukotriene B4 (also produced by epithelial cells, mast cells, and T lymphocytes) cause neutrophil activation (degranulation, reactive oxygen species production). Meanwhile, macrophage phagocytic function is impaired by cigarette smoking and cannot keep pace with the increased neutrophil burden.52 Enhanced neutrophil recruitment and activity combined with decreased macrophage phagocytosis weigh the scales heavily toward neutrophil-mediated tissue damage. COPD lungs are subjected to high levels of toxic neutrophil products including reactive oxygen species, elastase, and proteinases. These toxic substances overload the capacity of native antiproteinases and antioxidants to neutralize them, which leads to damaged epithelial cilia and decreased mucociliary clearance. Damage to the respiratory mucosa means that alveolar cells are replaced by goblet cells that increase mucous production. Furthermore, airways are progressively remodeled by the reparative process so that they become thicker, less-efficient conductors of air. There is some controversy with regard to the longevity of neutrophils isolated from the airways of COPD patients. Studies have shown both enhanced longevity and no enhancement of longevity whereas peripheral blood neutrophils appear to have an increased life span in keeping with systemic inflammation.",

IgE attaches to mast cells and basophils priming them to release histamine, leukotrienes, and ILs at subsequent exposures. Traditionally, asthma is an eosinophil-dominant disease and eosinophils are heavily recruited by the same TH2 cell type signaling (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6) responsible for the production of IgE. This process was thought to be under the direct control of IL-5 but as anti-IL-5 therapy has proved ineffective, it is suspected that there is a greater redundancy in the system. Anti-IL-5 therapy failed to significantly reduce eosinophil numbers in the asthmatic airway but did decrease deposition of extra-cellular matrix proteins suggesting a role for Il-5 in airway remodeling.63, 64 Interestingly, an IL-4 analog (pitrakinra), which prevents binding of IL-4 and IL-13 to IL-4\u03b1 receptor complex, attenuated the late-phase response (bronchoconstriction measured by reduction in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s) to allergen challenge. It is as yet unclear whether this success was due to inhibition of IL-4 alone, IL-13 alone, or due to combined inhibition.65 In addition, a role for TH17 cells has been postulated particularly in forms of asthma where neutrophil recruitment contributes to pathogenesis.66",

Anti-IgE therapy is showing promise in a subset of patients, and increased eosino-phil apoptosis and downregulation of inflammatory cytokines have been demonstrated in peripheral blood samples taken from asthmatics treated with omalizumab (a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds IgE). Future developments will probably include anti-IL-4, anti-IL-13, and potentially anti-Th17-based therapies, now that there is a rationale for their development. However, it is not always best practice to attempt a one-hit, magic-bullet cure especially in inflammatory disease where there is considerable redundancy in the cytokine system.

Healing by fibrosis results in significant loss of lung architecture and vital respiratory mucosa to scarring. Neutrophils are known to be present in BAL from IPF patients and are also significantly increased within lung tissue. In addition, there is evidence of the toxic chemicals produced by neutrophils including myeloperoxidase, elastase, collagenases, and proteases. The importance of this chemical insult is supported by the elastase knockout mouse, which is significantly protected against lung injury and also fails to upregulate TGF-\u03b2.74 A recent clinical paper has shown that significant neutrophilia within the BAL fluid of IPF patients correlates with increased mortality.75 It has been argued that the terminal scarring process of IPF occurs because of a significant loss of lung architecture and that where lung architecture is preserved there is potential for reversal of the remodeling process and resolution.72 It has also been suggested that the fibrotic response may in a sense be driven by a persistent but ineffective proresolution of inflammation phenotype. This hypothesis is drawn from the observation that TGF-\u03b2 is a key proresolution molecule but is also intimately involved in fibrogenesis. In a disease model where non-resolving low-level inflammation results in sustained TGF-\u03b2 production, it is possible to conceive that a fibrotic healing phenotype might evolve. Therapeutic strategies that drive neutrophils toward apoptosis will certainly have something to add to treatment of this disease if they can prevent or ameliorate the inflammatory insult (whether it be acute, chronic, or relapsing) that must be responsible for such extreme distortion of lung architecture.69, 70",

Analysis of BAL fluid from patients with early-stage ARDS demonstrates increased numbers of activated neutrophils and their numbers correlate with severity of lung injury. Indeed, persistence of BAL neutrophilia at day 7 is associated with increased mortality. The pulmonary circulation contains a large sequestered neutrophil population termed the \u201cmarginated\u201d pool that does not normally circulate but is loosely adhered to the vessel walls. This population can be mobilized into the circulation by steroid therapy or by exercise. Neutrophils are subject to slow transit through the pulmonary microvasculature where blood vessel diameters are smaller than their own. The ability of neutrophils to progress depends on their considerable properties of distensibility. In ARDS/ALI, neutrophils are recruited early in large numbers, and an alteration in their rheological properties (they become less deformable) means that they struggle to maneuver through vessels whereas cytokine excess encourages their adhesion to vessel walls and subsequent translocation into the lung parenchyma and airways. The influx of huge numbers of neutrophils and proteinaceous inflammatory edema fluid from permeabilized vessels impairs gas exchange and makes adequate ventilation extremely difficult.",

Neutrophils isolated from the BAL of ARDS patients have enhanced longevity, are activated, and may cause insurmountable damage to the respiratory mucosa leading to healing by fibrosis and permanent scarring with loss of lung architecture and function. In experimental models where neutrophils are depleted, ALI caused by endotoxin is attenuated. In other studies, enhancement of neutrophil apoptosis also reduced inflammatory parameters and tissue damage. The picture is complicated by apparent ARDS/ALI in neutropenic human patients. It is also clear that given the extravagant neutrophil influx associated with this condition, it would likely require a dual strategy of enhancing both neutrophil apoptosis and neutrophil clearance to ensure that secondary necrosis (and tissue damage) is prevented by prompt removal.76, 82",

Invading pathogens that overcome immediate host defenses are nonetheless recognized as foreign by their non-host constituents such as lipopolysaccharide or formylated peptides in their outer membranes. TLRs, CD14, and G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., FPR) found on macrophages and other respiratory mucosal cells are responsible for this detection and subsequently stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction by the production of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. This proinflammatory milieu prolongs neutrophil life span and promotes neutrophil activation to allow effective microbial phagocytosis and killing.3, 35 and 84 If the inflammatory reaction is successful in containing the pathogens and they are cleared by phagocytosis or killed, then the inflammatory reaction remains localized to a single lobe or segment of the lung. The upregulation of anti-inflammatory, proresolution molecules should ensure containment of inflammation. Neutrophil phagocytosis of bacteria and the induction of proresolution cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 promote neutrophil apoptosis and removal by macrophages.85",

A recent study that utilized a physiological steroid dose (supra-physiological doses had been employed in previous studies) has shown a significant reduction in length of hospital stay and mortality in Intensive Care Unit patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia.87 It is possible therefore that in a subgroup of patients with pneumonia, strategies to aid resolution of inflammation (in combination with antibiotic therapy) may be warranted.",

It is postulated that a relative dehydration of the respiratory mucosa means that the mucociliary escalator is compromised by viscid mucus and that altered mucosal pH results in malfunction of host antimicrobial peptides. There may also be a failure of normal bacterial internalization processes and it has been suggested that an intrinsic proinflammatory phenotype is conferred by CFTR malfunction. The proinflammatory phenotype theory postulates that an overburdened endosomal system encumbered by the processing of faulty CFTR signals distress, which leads to activation of NF-\u03baB. Production of IL-8 is stimulated resulting in enhanced neutrophil recruitment. Regardless, the net result is a failure of mucosal immunity, and a succession of bacterial infections occur (initially, Staphylococcus aureus and/or Haemophilus influenzae but subsequently and devastatingly P. aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). With bacterial colonization, innate defense is roused and a significant neutrophil influx occurs. This is usually thwarted, initially by microbial resistance and subsequently by distorted lung architecture. This results in an insurmountable accumulation of inflammatory cells and toxic damage from chemicals eluted by their necrotic carcasses. Elastase, reactive oxygen species, and myeloperoxidase cause further lung damage, and the clearance of inflammatory cells is so poor that the lungs literally become clogged with inflammatory cell DNA. Eventually, there is a terminal paucity of functional gas-exchange equipment, and respiratory failure and death supervene if lung transplant is not possible.88",

It was known that P. aeruginosa could effectively hide from the immune system in a protective and impenetrable bio-film. A more subtle effect mediated by pseudomonas produced pyocyanin has now been recognized. This chemical promotes neutrophil death but inhibits macrophage clearance resulting in neutrophil death by necrosis. This leads to the spillage of cathepsin G and elastase, which can cleave the important chemokine receptor CXCR1 on other neutrophils. This receptor would usually allow IL-8-mediated enhancement of neutrophil killing prowess, which enabling neutrophils to kill pseudomonas. In CF patients, neutrophils have little CXCR1 for the above reason and are consequently effectively crippled as well as out-maneuvered. Even more detrimental, fragments of this receptor stimulate the TLR system resulting in enhanced neutrophil recruitment and prolongation of the inflammatory response.89",
