The main contributions use deterministic epidemiological models (see Kucharski et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Sun et al., 2020, among others) , all focussing on the time evolution of the phenomena, especially with predictive purposes. The prediction of new infected, deceased and healed is certainly essential for health policy in order to estimate the capacity of a health system to cope with the stress caused by a pandemic. Nevertheless, in the recent literature the relevance of space in the diffusion of the COVID-19 is treated only marginally (Chinazzi et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b) , although the importance of spatial and spatio-temporal autocorrelation in epidemiology was already highlighted in the seminal book by Cliff and Ord (1981) . The authors show the effectiveness of statistical methods in analyzing the incidence of some epidemics, such as e.g. measles in Cornwall, 1969 Cornwall, -1970 in London in 1849 and tuberculosis and bronchitis in Wales, 1959 Wales, -1963 In the last 20 years spatial epidemiology has been evolving rapidly and it has found a great response in medical applied research (for a recent review on methods and applications in the field, see Kirby et al., 2017) .",

Reformulating this concept, it could be said that the phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside. In light of this, we found imperative to include a component that can account for spatial dependence among areal units in the study of COVID-19 diffusion, in order to explain the strength and direction of the spreading on the territory as well as in time. This is particularly relevant in countries such as Italy or Germany in which the local health systems interested by the disease are strongly regionalized. The territorial specificity, which can result in more or less drastic containment measures, cannot be neglected in a model construction that has the ambition to explain how the contagion moves in space and time and to allow reliable spatio-temporal predictions.",

Data are available from the websites of the main Italian newspapers, such as, Il Sole 24 ore. 2 Therefore, immediately after the release, we were able to collect the infectious disease count time series at provincial level for the period 1 NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) is a European Union geocode standard for referencing the subdivisions of countries for statistical purposes, established by Eurostat in agreement with each member state. The level of NUTS are four, nested into each other: NUTS-0 are the sovereign countries; NUTS-1 are the major socio-economic regions; NUTS-2 are basic regions for the application of regional policies (Italian regions); NUTS-3 are small regions for specific diagnoses (Italian provinces).",

Since spatial dependence may result stronger than it actually is at a coarse spatial resolution (Arbia et al., 1996) , we have wanted to use data at the provincial level of aggregation, which is the freely available finest possible level of aggregation. For the first six days, data were provided only to media outlets and published by newspapers in the form of interactive maps. For this period, we have used web scraping techniques to track raw data upon which maps have been constructed. For the remaining days, we simply downloaded data about provinces released by the Department of Civil Protection. Clearly, at this stage, data suffer from several problems of quality. The number of contagions is continuously updated and positive swabs need to be confirmed by the National Institute of Health, not to mention several cases of delayed reporting by the local authorities. Therefore, the results presented in the paper may benefit from availability of more accurate data. The overall temporal distribution of daily counts of COVID-19 infections is depicted in Figure 1 , 3 while the spatial distribution is showed in the map in Figure 2 . The two plots indicate that while the growth of cases over time in Italy has been globally exponential, it is characterized by strong local heterogeneity and also by a relevant spatial pattern in the form of a hot-spot in the northern part of the country (the plot of the time series disaggregated for all Italian provinces is reported in the Appendix).",

We can clearly see that only few provinces, the most affected by the disease until now, are mainly influenced by the local endogenous transmission of the contagion (map on the left). For a relatively higher number of provinces, mostly located in the north and center parts of the country, a relevant number of cases is instead explained by the transmission from neighboring provinces (map on the centre). For the majority of provinces, located mainly in the south, the contagions follow essentially the endemic trend (map on the right). The comparison among provinces in terms of the three investigated components is robust to spuriousness because the Italian population is entirely and homogeneously susceptible, that is immunologically \"naive\", to this new virus.

First of all, the province of Lodi (Lombardy region), which is the first area that reported cases, sees a predominance of the component related to the internal diffusion of the disease. This evidence agrees with the quarantine to which some of its municipalities underwent since the beginning of the outbreak and with the hypothesis that the epidemic in Italy started right there. The province of Lodi shares the eastern border with the province of Cremona (Lombardy region), that in turn shares the northern border with the province of Bergamo (Lombardy region) as depicted in Figure 4 . The latter two are so far some among the most severely affected provinces in Italy. Their proximity with the province of Lodi makes them widely susceptible to the contagion effect between neighboring regions. This suggests that the contagion of infections among inhabitants occurred before containment measures were carried out and that the disease remained undetected before patient 1 was discovered. A similar situation arose for the province of Parma (Emilia-Romagna region), which share the norther border with the province of Cremona. Even here the between-epidemic component is relevant and it may be explained with the strong social and economic ties existing among the areas. The second in time discovered outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy was detected in a small town in the province of Padova (Veneto region). Even in this case, strong control measures to reduce transmission outside have been carried out, as evidenced by the almost total influence of the within-epidemic component. This shows that there have been no \"return infections\" from the surrounding areas but it does not mean that, before the quarantine, the infection could not have circulated in the neighboring provinces. In fact, the province of Venice (Veneto region), which is geographically, culturally and economically near to that of Padova demonstrates to be affected by these form of interactions. The cases of the provinces near the national borders are also of particular interest, such as the provinces of Turin (Piedmont region) and Trieste (Friuli Venezia Giulia region), adjoining with France and Slovenia, respectively. These provinces may be affected by the so-called boundary problem for which the analysis of a phenomenon may be biased by the presence of arbitrary administrative geographic borders. Thus, on one side we might lose information regarding what happens beyond the country border, due to different ways of collect information and monitor the diffusion of the disease. One the other side, we might not have a clear overview about cross-border phenomena as job trajectories. In addition, the two considered provinces seem to be not connected with the aforementioned outbreaks originated in Lombardy and Veneto regions. Due to these reasons, the provinces of Turin and Trieste show a limited effect of epidemic components and a prevalence of the endemic component, which is due only to the evolution of the disease over time. Looking at the national aggregated counts, the exponential evolution of COVID-19 contagions is clear. On the country as a whole, the main component seems to be the temporal trend but also the epidemic components have a not negligible role. The observed decomposition is probably mainly due to the central and southern provinces, which are characterized almost exclusively by the spread over time component.",

The observed total number of cases at 18 March 2020, obtained by aggregating the province data, is 4204; the model provides a prediction of 4191 cases. Therefore, the model underestimates by only 14 units. Naturally, the advantage of the proposed model is that it provides predictions for each individual province (point predictions can be found in Tables 2 and 3 of the Appendix) but it is clear that the use of predictions at local level can have positive effects on the prediction of total number at country level. We report (in Figure 2 of the Appendix) the 80% prediction intervals of the provincial counts of infections at 18 March 2020. Given the brevity of the observed time series, to obtain a reasonable degree of precision we cannot require higher confidence levels. Despite the fact that the intervals are quite wide, the results are promising if compared with the known observed counts.

The use of spatio-temporal models can greatly improve the estimation of number of infected and can help the public decision-makers to better plan health policy interventions. Italy has viewed a massive spread of the disease with peculiar patterns on the territory. Started from some provinces in the northern area, this serious illness descended down the Boot and is nowadays present in all 107 Italian provinces. Several discrepancies among provinces, especially between north and center-south of the country, persist but coming weeks seem to be decisive to understand the behavior of the contagion trend. Containment measures in Italy have followed an application in three steps: first, some municipalities in Lombardy and Veneto regions underwent to quarantine; second, the entire Lombardy and some provinces in other northern regions (Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Marche) were isolated from the rest of the country; third, all Italian territories were subjected to a complete lockdown. Such stepwise approach in imposing hard control measures to the entire national territory might have conducted to a temporal shifting of the contagion dynamics. Emblematic is the case of the province of Lodi, the first area submitted to the quarantine. After an average increment of 85 cases when the illness began to be systematically discovered, in the last 5 days of the time series, which correspond to three weeks after the lockdown, this province seems to have settled the average number of newly discovered contagions equal to 42 cases (so the contagions have been halved). This fact suggests that policies of contagion containment seem to exert a mild success so far in the areas in which there was an effective enforcement of the control measures. Instead, in metropolitan areas where the population density and the more active social behavior make more difficult to comply properly to the recommendations, the whished effects are not yet taking place. This is the case of the province of Milan, which is experiencing an increasing number of cases in last days (from an average of 9 new cases detected of the beginning to an average of 273 new cases of last days). And then there is the case of center and southern provinces, which have viewed a delayed start of the epidemics but also the arrival, in the last two weeks, of flows of people escaped from northern regions undergone to lockdown. As an example, the province of Florence went from an average increment of 3 new cases of the first period to an average increment of 41 new cases of last 5 days, and, similarly, the province of Naples, has gone from an average increment of 4 new cases to an average increment of 29 new cases, confirming the hypothesis of downhill race of the disease along the peninsula. All this has led to the failure in applying homogeneous measures at national level, also due to regional autonomy in force in Italy and to important local differences, which may lead to delays or failures in containing the contagions from a global point of view. This evidence suggests that consider the peculiarities of local territories may be effective in planning specific strategies for enforcing the containment measures established at national level.",

Since the epidemics started, a frequent question of the public decision-maker is about when the peak of contagions will manifest. Probably a more appropriate request should concern the emergence of different local peaks in different moments, which Italy should expect in next weeks. The dramatic events in northern provinces can serve as a test bench for the health system, offering an overview about what southern provinces might be confronted. Analyses and predictions both in space and time offer a decisive perspective about which areas may be more affected and when, given the time to the decision-makers to intervene on the local policies.",
