However, because many COVID-19 cases are never diagnosed, the CFR almost certainly overestimates the true lethality of the virus. Instead, the better answer is captured by the infection fatality rate (IFR) (Wong et al., 2013; Kobayashi et al., 2020) . The IFR, also a simple ratio, differentiates itself from the CFR by considering all cases, including the asymptomatic, undetected and misdiagnosed infections, in the denominator. For instance, if 20 individuals die of the disease in a population with 1000 infections, then the IFR is 20 / 1000 = 0.02 = 2%.",

Due to this severity bias, the reported number of cases likely includes mostly people whose symptoms were severe enough to be tested and excludes the vast majority of those who are mildly-or asymptomatic. Even when testing is made equally available to all individuals (e.g., Bendavid et al. (2020) ), there is potential for \"selection bias\" if people who have reason to believe they are infected are more likely to volunteer to be tested. We refer to the phenomenon whereby infected individuals are more likely to be tested than non-infected individuals, as \"preferential testing.\" (Hauser et al. (2020) and others use the term \"preferential ascertainment.\") If the degree of preferential testing in a particular sample is of known magnitude, bias adjustment can be achieved by appropriately altering the estimated rate of infection and its uncertainty interval. However, the degree of preferential testing is no doubt difficult to ascertain and likely highly variable across different jurisdictions. An open question is whether or not it is possible to reliably estimate the IFR without any specific knowledge about the degree to which the data are biased by preferential testing (Q1). If not, should we rely only on select samples for which testing is representative and ignore the vast majority of available data? (Q2) In this paper, we address these two important questions by considering a simple Bayesian hierarchical model for estimation of the IFR.",

(2009) conduct Bayesian inference to estimate the severity of pandemic H1N1 influenza; see also Presanis et al. (2011) . More recently, Rinaldi and Paradisi (2020) , and Hauser et al. (2020) employ Bayesian methods for estimating the severity of COVID-19 from early data from China and Italy. In order to address preferential testing bias, Hauser et al. (2020) apply susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental models to age-stratified data and, in order to establish parameter identifiability, assume that all cases of infected patients aged 80 years and older are confirmed cases. The Bayesian model we propose is more general and allows one to obtain appropriate point and interval estimates for the IFR with varying degrees of prior knowledge about the magnitude of preferential testing and the distribution of other explanatory factors (e.g. age, minority status). This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce required notation, discuss distributional assumptions and review key issues of identifiability. In Section 3, we formulate our Bayesian model and present a small illustrative example. In Section 4, we describe how the model can be scaled for larger populations and present results from a simulation study. In Section 5, we go over potential model extensions as well as model limitations. Finally, we conclude in Section 6 with a discussion of how the model could be used for an analysis of COVID-19 data and return to the questions of interest, Q1 and Q2.",

As emphasized in Gustafson et al. (2009) , the average frequentist coverage of a Bayesian credible interval, taken with respect to the prior distribution over the parameter space, will equal the nominal coverage. This mathematical property is unaffected by the lack of identification. However, the variability of coverage across the parameter space is difficult to anticipate and could be highly affected by the choice of prior. For example, we might expect that, in the absence of preferential testing (i.e., when \u03b3 = 0), coverage will be lower than the nominal rate. However, if this is the case, coverage will need to be higher than the nominal rate when \u03b3 > 0, so that the \"average\" coverage (taken with respect to the prior distribution over the parameter space) is nominal overall.",

As of May 2020, nonpreferential testing has only been reported for limited populations where the entire population was tested, including the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship, four US prisons where all inmates and staff were tested, and the town of Vo', Italy (Field Briefing, 2020; Lavezzo et al., 2020; So and Sminth, 2020; Aspinwall and Neff, 2020) . Of these, only the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship had made testing and outcome data publicly available at the age-group level at the time of publication (Field Briefing, 2020); (participantlevel age and test result data are available for Vo', Italy, but no outcome data were listed at the time of publication). Munich, Germany has undertaken a populationrepresentative prospective cohort study where researchers randomly selected addresses and all household members will be asked to complete COVID-19-related questions and serologic testing (Radon et al., 2020) . While the research protocol does not specify when, whether, or how the data would be made publicly available, the Munich data will be an important resource as perhaps the first large-scale, population-representative dataset that is not affected by preferential testing.",

First (Q1), is it possible to reliably estimate the IFR without any specific knowledge about the degree to which the data are biased by preferential testing? And secondly (Q2), must we only rely on select samples for which testing is representative and ignore the vast majority of available data? The proposed Bayesian model suggests that reliable estimation of the IFR at the group level is indeed possible when existing data do not reflect a random sample from the target population, and when limited knowledge is available about the likely magnitude of preferential testing. Importantly, the key to (partial) identifiability is sufficient heterogeneity in the degree of preferential testing across groups and sufficient homogeneity in the group-specific IFR. We also saw that, one need not ignore the vast majority of available data that may be biased by preferential testing. This data, with appropriate adjustment, can supplement any available representative data in order to sharpen the inference.",

This reflects the additional uncertainty of not knowing about the absence/presence of preferential testing. Otherwise, when \u03b3 > 0, we see that ignoring preferential testing has significant consequences. With the M {\u03b3=0} model, the 95% CI for \u03b8 fails to include the target when \u03b3 > 0.
