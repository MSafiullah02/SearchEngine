The hosts of twenty-three species which attack Asteraceae are listed, including those being used or investigated as possible weed biocontrol agents. The species are divided into four species groups and the differing host relationships and types of galls induced by these groups are discussed. U.lopholomae sp.n. and U.afJinis ssp. calcitrapae ssp.n., associated with Centaurea (Lopholoma) spp. and C. (Culcitrapa) spp. respectively, are described. U . algerica (Hering) and U.sjumorum (Rohdendorf) are both treated as subspecies of U. quadrifasciata (Meigen). U.pontica is given full specific status and U.hispanica is removed from synonymy. The following new synonymies are made (junior synonyms in parentheses): U. angustifascia (Hering)",

The only named subgenus is Asimoneura which was described by Czerny (in Czerny & Strobl, 1909) for the Spanish species, U.stroblii Czerny. Between 1909 and 1963 the earlier name of Euribia was used by authors such as Hendel (1927) and Hering (1933 Hering ( , 1935 Hering ( , 1937 Hering ( , 1938a Hering ( , b, 1940 Hering ( , 1941 Hering ( ,1953 Hering ( ,1956 Hering ( ,1961 . However, in 1963 the International Commission for Zoological Nomenclature (opinion 678) ruled that the pamphlet of Meigen (1800) be suppressed and all species described as Euribia should therefore be placed in Urophora. The recent Catalogue of Palaearctic Diptera (Foote, 1984) listed sixtyfive species, thirty-three of which occur within the area covered by this paper. Since completion of the catalogue a further species has been described from this area by Freidberg (1982) ; Korneyev (1984 Korneyev ( , 1985 has added four species from the U.S.S.R., and single species have been described from Japan (Ito, 1983) and Korea (Kwon, 1985) . The present paper describes one additional species and a subspecies, and reduces the western Palaearctic list to twenty-five species as a result of new synonyms",

In this paper, aculeus apex shape is used as a major identification character (Figs 30-64 ). Most species have very similar male terminalia. with neither the surstyli (Figs 1-5,7, 8, 10, 1 I ) , or the poorly sclerotized aedeagal glans yielding tenable diagnostic characters. However, a few species have well-sclerotized aedeagal glans and male terminalia characters can be used to divide the genus into four species groups; the critical characters are presented in the group diagnoses. Another male character that is sometimes species specific is the shape of the abdominal sternites . These vary from being very broad in the stem gall forming U.curdui (Fig. 21 ), to very narrow in U.angustifascia and both of the Echinops associated species . However, other species are very variable and have a sternite shape between those two extremes (Figs 17. 18) , although there may sometimes be a deep cleft in the most heavily sclerotized part of sternite 5, sometimes approaching the depth shown in Fig. 22 .",

The terms primary and sccondary aculeus steps are also used; an aculeus with a single pair of preapical steps or shoulders is said to have primary steps only (e.g. Figs [43] [44] [45] ; an aculeus with two pairs of steps has both primary (proximal) and secondary (distal) steps (e.g. Figs 52-55). Following Steyskal (lY79) . the wing crossbands are named subbasal (covering bm-cu), discal (covering rm), preapical (covering dm-cu) and apical; see for examples with all four crossbands. Measurements were only taken from dissected females, and these are given in the species descriptions. with dimensions of exceptionally small or large individuals given in parentheses; malcs tend to smaller than females. The following abbreviations are used for measurements:",

It was found that the eggs of U.stigma are about 0.6 mm long, very broad and have a distinct apical opening (Fig. 24) which is presumed to be a micropyle (see Margaritis, 1985) . The eggs of the other species examined are much narrower and 0.6-0.8 mm long (Fig. 23 ).

Some species are known to spend the first larval instar in the egg and emerge as second instars; these are U.cardui (Peschken & Harris, 1975) , U.jaceana (Varley, 1937) and U.stylata (Redfern, 1968) . Species which are known to emerge as first instar larvae are U.afinis and U.quadrifasciata (P. Harris, pers. comm.) . Of these species, those that hatch as second instar larvae induce multilocular galls, while those that hatch as first instar larvae induce unilocular galls (P. Harris, pers. comm.) . Group 1 species of known biology induce a variety of gall types, usually formed of receptacle tissue (Zwolfer, 1983; Harris & Myers, 1984) , which engulfs the larval chamber that is situated in the achene or the receptacle (Freidberg, 1984) . These galls are lignified and may be multilocular, e.g. U.jaceana (Varley, 1947) and U.styZata (Harris & Wilkinson, 1984) or unilocular, e.g. U.afinis (P. Harris, pers. comm.) , U.jaculata and U.sirunaseva (White & Clement, 1987) ; often, unilocular galls occur multiply within a single flower head and they can be confused with the true multilocular galls. Conversely, U.quadrifasciata forms a papery, non-lignified, gall from the ovary wall (Harris &Myers, 1984) . The only species known to form a gall which is not within the capitulum of its host-plant, is U.cardui which forms a multilocular stem gall (Lalonde & Shorthouse, 1982 ) on a narrow range of Cirsium species. It is likely that galltype could be a useful classificatory character, but details of this kind are not yet available for most species. Members of this group are found throughout the Palaearctic region, with a single species in Taiwan, U. formosana (Shiraki) , and introduced species in North America and Australia.",

Urophora scutellata Rondani, 1970: 15,21 . Urophora aprica (Fallen) yellow; basal scutellar seta based within the broad marginal black area, except in some Turkish specimens; femora black, at least in basal two-thirds orange apically, except in Turkish specimens which have extensive orange areas on at least the fore-and mid-femora. Wing: base yellow; subbasal crossband extending between veins C and A1; subbasal and discal crossbands separated by a narrow yellow area, but sometimes joined between veins C and R4+5; discal and preapical crossbands separated; hyaline area between preapical and discal crossbands 1- Comments. The name U.aprica has been misapplied to small specimens of U. terebrans (previously known as U.approximata) and to U.lopholomae. Although it is a Fallen species, Hering (1938b) actually described U. approximata as a new species for what he thought was the 'aprica' of Fallen and then gave a key to separate it from the 'aprica' of Loew. The lectotype is mould covered and in a delicate state. Consequently, it was not dissected, but its external features are sufficiently distinct as to leave little doubt about the identity of this species. U. brunicornis was described within Robineau-Desvoidy's (1830) description of U. centaureae suggesting that it is likely to be a synonym of U.aprica.",

The deep apical notch and primary steps of this species (Fig. 51) indicate that it is probably a very close relative of U.cuspidatu (Fig. SO) , but the section beyond the primary steps is very elongate and it lacks the distinct sccondary steps of U.cuspidata. A single male of Terellia colon (Meigen) , or a very closely related species, was also reared from the same collection of C. depressa capitula. T. colon, like U . cuspidata, is normally only associated with Centaurea subgenus Lopholoma; this implies that C. depressa is probably very similar to Lopholoma species in terms of the characteristics that are of importance to these tephritids. This Urophora species is not formally described here because the aculeus tip shape could only be studied on one specimen and the possibility that this is simply an aberrant U.cuspidata cannot be discounted.",

In southern France a population of Urophora which were morphologically identical to U . jaceana were swept off C . (Acrolophus) spinabadia at a site where no subgenus Jacea could be found. Acrolophus species are the normal hosts of U.afinis ajj'inis, which has an identical aculeus tip shape to U.jaceana, suggesting that these may be closely related species.

Previous authors have called this species U.dzieduszyckii, but that name refers to a much larger species whose female was described as having a wing length of 4.4 mm. Specimens from France were regarded as the nominal subspecies of U.dzieduszyckii by Hering (1937), who described subspecies pontica from near Volgograd, because it lacked the abnormally long fore coxae of his nominal subspecies. Hering (1937) described the nominal subspecies as having the fore coxae as long as the fore femur. In fact, Hering's own specimens (BMNH) have the fore coxae 0.74.8 (36) and 0.8 (1 9 ) times as long as thefore femur, and the specimens labelled as 'paratype ssp. pontica' in the BMNH have the fore coxae 0.6 ( I ? , 16) times as long as the fore femur (this is typical of all other Urophora species); an additional specimen from Turkey has a ratio of 0.8 (19). These data suggest that there may be a tendency towards abnormally long fore coxae in Mediterranean and western European individuals of this species, but the evidence is tenuous and there is no good reason to give any of these poorly known populations subspecific status.",

Comments. Urophora quadrifasciata is a very variable species and two forms of aculeus shape can be distinguished (Figs 31,32, & 33-35) . One of these forms can be further divided by differences in aculeus length. The resulting three forms each attack non-overlapping ranges of host-plants and have some geographic separation. There is some rather circumstantial evidence that U. quadrifasciata is a species complex, and this is presented in the discussion. With the evidence available at present, it would be unwise to attempt to distinguish true species within this possible complex. However, the three morphologically distinct forms may be regarded as subspecies and these are separated by the following key: Aculeus margins swollen before apex; each margin is not parallel to the lumen wall (Figs 33-35) .",

Terminalia: aculeus apex, Fig. 31 . Biology. U. quadrifasciata quadrifasciata attacks the capitula of Centaurea species belonging to subgenera Acrolophus, Cyanus, Jacea, Phalolepis and Solstitiaria. In Acrolophus species which are adventive in Canada, this subspecies of U.quadrifasciata induces a thin nonlignified gall, formed from the wall of an ovary (Harris & Myers, 1984) , and the larvae emerge in the first instar (P. Harris, pers. cbmm.). Sobhian & Zwolfer (1985) describe the gall of U. quadrifasciata in Centaurea solstitialis as 'a gall in the ovary and later [the larva] feeds within a transformed achene the seed coat of which is inflated'. This reference to an inflated seed coat suggests that the galls examined by Harris & Myers (1984) and Sobhian & Zwolfer (1985) may differ in structure, but this has not been confirmed.",

The available slide mounted wing labelled as 'armeniaca' in the Hering collection (BMNH) has the typical pattern of U.quadrifasciata; its size (WL=4.1 mm), long ovipositor and type locality, indicated that it is also most likely to be this subspecies of U. quadrifasciata.",

In the mountain areas of the Jura, the Alps and southern Germany, a form with dark femora and broad black margins to the scutellum has been found associated with C.defloratus; there is no evidence that this is not conspecific with other Carduus associated populations and the dark coloration may be the effect of cold winter diapause; such an effect has been experimentally induced in some butterflies such as Pieris brassicae (Gardiner, 1979) . Furthermore, alpine populations of U.cuspidata have similar broad black margins to the scutellum. U.sonderupi is here regarded as a synonym of U.solstitialis, although it was apparently reared from Cirsium vulgare, rather than from a species of Carduus; this unusual host association is detailed in the discussion.",

No female syntype of U.solstitialis could be located, but Linnaeus described this species as being Carduus associated and its identity is assumed from that information (White, 1987) . Similarly, the types of U.dauci, U.leucacanthi and U. femoralis were unavailable for study, and the types of U.hastatus and U.pugionata were too frail to be dissected; for nomenclatorial stability these nominal species, whose types have the typical wing pattern and size of U.solstitialis, were all assumed to be synonyms of U.solstitialis. Both U. veruata and U.sibynata have the typical aculeus tip shape and wing pattern of the species which attacks Carduus and they are also assumed to be that species. U.sonderupi also has this aculeus tip shape and wing pattern, but it was apparently reared from Cirsium vulgare.

However, the type locality is England, and the wing pattern of the available syntype is typical of the species which attacks Cirsium vulgare in England. The identity of the available syntypes of U. venabulata was confirmed by examination of the aculeus apex. U.pia was described by Hering (1938a) from a single male which was collected at the same locality, and by the same collector, as typical specimens of U.stylata, and U.pia is probably only an aberrant U.stylata that differs from typical specimens by having a partly formed subbasal crossband. Similarly, U. vulcanica could only be identified by its wing pattern and no syntypes of U.cirsii or U.jacobeae could be located; these species were regarded as synonyms of U.stylata to maintain nomenclatorial stability. The eastern Palaearctic species U.suchalinensis (Shiraki), U.japonica (Shiraki) and U.carnpes-tris Ito are very similar to U.stylata, and their status will be discussed in a later paper (Korneyev & White, in prep.) . U.styfata has been established in North America for the biocontrol of Cirsium arvense (Harris & Wilkinson, 1984; Piper, 1985) . The name Musca stylata Fabricius 1775, has also been used for a species of the related genus Myopites Blot, normally known as 'M.styfatus (Frabricius, 1794)'; Fabricius (1794) gives Musca stytata as a redescription from his work of 1775. Only Urophora stylata fits the original description of Musca stylata which was described from England, an area from which the species known as 'Myopites styfatus' is not known to occur (White, 1988) ; this Myopites species should therefore be known by its synonym Myopites limbardae Schiner, 1864 .",

The oldest available name that may apply to this species is U.dzieduszyckii, but this nominal species has no type locality and the female from which it was described could not be located. Previous authors, such as Hendel (1927) and Foote (1984) , give the type locality of U. dzieduszyckii as being Poland. This is an error caused by the fact that Frauenfeld (1867) was sent the specimen by M. Nowicki of Krakow, Poland. Frauenfeld also acknowledges W. Dzieduszycki, who was presumably the collector, and notes that Dzieduszycki was a supporter of a museum in Lemberg, now in Latvian S.S.R. Hendel(l927) examined the type of U. dzieduszyckii, and even presents a photograph of its wing. Frauenfeld described the species as being larger that U.eriolepidis (a synonym of U.tere-brans), and as having a wing length of 4.4 mm. It is just possible that U.dzieduszyckii is an aberrant U.cardui found in Latvian S.S.R., but the wing photograph presented by Hendel (1927) and its large size, suggest that U.dzieduszyckii is more likely to be the Echinops associated species found in the Middle East. There is little doubt that the holotypes of U.syriaca and U. erichischmidti also represent this Echinops associated species, which is here referred to as U.syriaca as that is the oldest confirmed name.

Previous authors, for example Steyskal (1979) , separated U.terebrans and U.eriolepidis on the basis of the relative breadth of the hyaline area between the discal and preapical wing crossbands; however, this appears to be geographic variation in a single species. Specimens from Germany, including the syntypes of U. approximata, are sma!ler than U.terebrans from other areas, but they have the same aculeus tip shape and they attack the same host as U.terebrans in the Pyrenees; these differences are probably also explained by geographic variation. Hendel (1927) described U. manni because he said it had 3-4 pairs of frontal setae, rather than the usual 2 pairs. In fact the type specimens each differ in the number of frontals on each side of their heads, and the paralectotype was found to have the typical aculeus tip shape of U.terebrans. Consequently, it is assumed that the types of U.manni are simply aberrant specimens of U. terebrans.",

Urophora maura (Frauenfeld, 1857) ; Steyskal, 1979: 11; Foote, 1984: 143. Redescription. Head: first flagellomere orange; palpi yellow, darkening to orange apically; palpi shape similar to U. cardui, but slightly narrower; gena about 0.2-0.3 times eye height; labellum about 1-1.5 times length of first flagellomere. Thorax: scutum with a dense tomentum which obscures the underlying cuticle; postpronotal lobe often largely yellow, but sometimes mostly black with a small yellow spot just posterior to postpronotal seta; basal scutellar seta based within the central yellow area of the scutellum; femora orange. Wing: without crossbands; entirely hyaline except for yellow cell sc. Terminalia: aculeus, Fig. 62 and Richter (1970) lists Lsalicina as a host, but there is no indication of the original source of this record. Although no reared specimens were examined. there is no reason to doubt the association with Inula. The records of U.maura associated with Acroptilon repens (L.) DC. (Tyurebaev. 1981; Watson & Harris, 1984) probably refer to either U.xanthippe (Munro) or U. impicta (Hering) .",

            "text": "Many of the Urophora species described in this paper are very variable in characters such as size and wing pattern. Previous authors, such as Hendel(1927) and Hering(1937 Hering( ,1938a Hering( , b, 1940 Hering( , 1961 , accepted some mere varietal forms as distinct species. For example, U.terebrans and U.approximata were distinguished by the relative lengths of their ovipositors, despite the fact that both of these nominal species attack the same host and there is no evidence to suggest that the longer ovipositor of U.terebrans is anything other than an allometric artefact of its larger body size. Loew (1856) , and all subsequent authors, distinguished U. terebrans, from the Pyrenees, and U.eriolepidis, from Austria, by the relative separation of their discal and preapical crossbands, although there is no other distinct difference between these two nominal species. Similarly, Hendel (1927) separated U.manni from other Urophora species because he said it has three, rather than two pairs of frontal setae. In fact the lectotype of U.rnanni has three frontal setae on one side of its head, and two on the other, and it is clearly an aberrant individual of U. terebrans. These earlier authors were unaware of allometry, they did not have large enough collections with which to detect geographic variation in wing patterns, and they often failed to detect aberrant chaetotaxy. They also lacked the benefit of our present knowledge of host-plant relationships, which was largely founded upon the work of Zwolfer (19650, and they were unaware of the taxonomic value of the aculeus tip shape. In this paper U. eriolepidis, U.manni and U.approximata are all placed in synonymy with U.terebrans because there is no good evidence to suggest that they are distinct species, although it would be unwise to discount such a possibility entirely. A similar approach was taken in the interpretation of all the species covered by this paper. Consequently, the nomenclatural confusion caused by such illfounded nominal species as U.rnanni should have been overcome. However, some of the socalled 'species' described in this paper may in fact be groups of very closely related species that cannot be easily distinguished morphologically. The possible species complexes will now be discussed.",

These two Urophora species are superficially quite different in appearance, as they differ in both size and wing pattern, but they share an almost identical aculeus tip shape (Figs 5 M 1 ) which suggests that they may be closely related species. In central Europe they are never found on each other's range of hosts and there is little doubt that they are distinct species in that area. However, individuals that are morphologically identical to U. jaceana have been found on a species of Acrolophus on the Mediterranean coast of France. Furthermore, flies which are the size of U.jaceana, but with the wing pattern of U.affinis, are found attacking species of the subgenus Centaurea (Calcitrapa) in Turkey and the Middle East, and these populations are named here as U.ufjinis subspecies calcitrapae. A few specimens reared from Acrolophus species in Turkey were examined, and found to be typical of subspecies afjinis. The discovery of both subspecies in an area of sympatry, suggests that the two 'subspecies' may in fact be distinct species. However, the only Turkish specimens of subspecies afjinis were not from sites where subspecies calcitrapae was found, so there is no evidence that the two subspecies are distinct when they occur together at a single site. Consequently, the two forms of U.affinis should be treated as subspecies until more conclusive evidence is obtained to support their separation. Similarly, the flies from southern France, which were found on Centaurea (Acrolophus) spinabadia, are unlikely to be genetically typical U.jaceana, as that species has never been found associated with such closely related plant species as C. ( A . ) maculosa, although C.maculosa has been well surveyed by several weed biocontrol specialists. These data suggest that central European U.afJinis subspecies affinzs and U.jaceana may simply be the morphological extremes of a series of at least four groups of populations, some or all of which may be reproductively isolated and therefore distinct species.",

U. quadrifasciata quadrifasciata is widespread on adventive species of Acrolophus in North America, but it rarely attacks C. (Jacea) nigra, although that is a heavily attackedplant in Europe. Similarly, it has spread into the North American range of C.solstitialis, but it has not yet been recorded as attacking that plant, although that is a host of the nominal subspecies in Europe. Without biological evidence, such as the results of host choice tests, combined with the discovery of morphometric differences between sympatric populations, there is no good reason to regard any of the populations here referred to as U. quadrifasciata as anything other than forms of a single polytypic species. However, appropriate study may show that this socalled 'species' is actually a complex of several species, some or all of which only attack a very narrow range of closely related Centaurea species.",

In any genus of monophagous or oligophagous insects it is impossible to be certain about the true limits of species that show hostrelated variation, unless very expensive and detailed studies are undertaken of each of the potential species complexes. This revision has stopped short of actually attempting detailed studies of each possible species complex. As a compromise, the available evidence suggesting that some of the 'species' described here may actually be species complexes has been presented, and these data should be taken into account when using the host list (see appendix) as a reference source for selecting potential weed biocontrol agents. throughout most of its range, but from the Danish islands of Lolland and Falster there are some reared series from Cirsium vulgare. This plant has been well surveyed in many areas of Europe by Zwolfer (1965) , and by several subsequent weed biocontrol specialists, but no further finds of U.solstitialis have been made on it. However, there is a single record of specimens identical to normal U. solstitialis reared from Cirsium helenioides in Switzerland (leg. Zwolfer). The Danish specimens are smaller than typical Curduus associated specimens of U.solstitialis and they were described as a separate species called U.sonderupi by Hering (1940) . It is possible that U.sonderupi is a distinct species, but this is unlikely as it has never been found again on Cirsium vulgare. It is also possible that the host-plant was a misidentified Carduus species, possibly C.acanthoides or C.crispus, but that does not explain why the specimens were unusually small. It is also possible that Cirsium vulgare is the normal host of U.solstitialis in Scandinavia, as that area has not been well surveyed. No obvious conclusion can be drawn from these possibilities and U.sonderupi is here regarded as a synonym of U.solstitialis because there is no good evidence that it is a distinct species.",

All of the species attacked by I/. hispanica are component parts of plant communities which grow adjacent to each other in coastal western Mediterranean areas.
