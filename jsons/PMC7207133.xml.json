No doubt there was confounding by increased globalisation among more developed countries (with higher GHSI). Increased exposure to foreigners travelling for the purposes of tourism, business and use of healthcare is likely to increase the risk of new infectious pathogens being introduced. Similarly, mass migration contributes to disruption of local bacterial and viral environments.2 Furthermore, the rarity of pandemics in conjunction with false reassurance from a high GHSI may have contributed to more lenient adherence to infection control mechanisms in recent years.6\n",
