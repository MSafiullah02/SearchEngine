            "text": "The first reports of RSV infections in nursing home residents appeared in the 1970s, and since then there have been at least 20 published accounts of RSV in long-term care facilities.[13\u201330] Some reports described RSV outbreaks involving between 8 and 52 residents, with overall attack rates ranging from 12% to 89%. In 11 prospective surveillance studies, attack rates were considerably lower, ranging from 1.4% to 40%. Much of this inconsistency can be attributed to the use of relatively insensitive serological assays and/or culture for diagnosis, and to the fact that case definitions varied substantially. In the prospective studies, pneumonia rates were 0\u201333% and death occurred in 0\u20135%. In one prospective winter surveillance study conducted in a large Rochester, NY, USA nursing home, RSV infection was documented in 40 persons by culture and sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA).[17] The overall attack rate was 7% and RSV was identified as the cause of 27% of the illnesses. Although the presence of both group A and B viruses indicated at least two separate virus introductions, the room locations of infected patients and the clustering of RSV strain types strongly suggested nosocomial transmission by healthcare workers. In most of the outbreaks reported, RSV circulated simultaneously with other viruses, most notably influenza A virus, thus highlighting the error of attributing all respiratory tract illnesses to influenza when a few cases are identified.",

In order to obtain a broader view of RSV disease burden in nursing home residents, Ellis et al.[31] conducted a population-based analysis of the effect of influenza and RSV infections in 81 885 nursing home residents in Tennessee, USA. This retrospective cohort study estimated rates of cardiopulmonary hospitalisation, medical care utilisation and death during 4 consecutive years by linking them to viral activity in the general community. On average, RSV accounted for 15 hospitalisations, 76 courses of antibacterials, and 17 deaths per 1000 persons, and for 7% and 9% of all cardiopulmonary hospitalisations and deaths, respectively. In contrast, influenza was responsible for 28 hospitalisations and 15 deaths per 1000 persons. Notably, morbidity but not mortality was higher among those with co-morbid conditions.",

A second publication from Sweden encompassing a 10-year period described 57 RSV-infected adults with a mean age of 75 years, of whom two-thirds had pneumonia.[34] A more recent 3-year analysis of elderly persons hospitalised during the winter with acute cardiopulmonary symptoms identified RSV serologically in 10% and influenza in 13%.[35] Eighteen percent of RSV-infected persons were admitted to the intensive care unit, 10% required ventilatory support and 10% died. Discharge diagnoses included pneumonia in 44%, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 19% and congestive heart failure (CHF) in 20%. In a recent report, the same investigators identified 61 RSV infections among 625 persons (10%) admitted to a large Rochester, NY, USA hospital for acute cardiopulmonary disease.[36] In this study, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used in addition to culture and serology to detect viral aetiology. In another analysis of 1195 adults of all ages admitted to Ohio, USA hospitals with pneumonia, Dowell et al.[37] found that RSV was the third most common aetiology (4.4%), behind Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.2%) and influenza virus (5.4%). Of the 57 RSV-infected persons, 68% were >64 years of age. In another study using culture and a virus neutralisation assay, Glezen et al.[38] identified only two RSV infections in 150 hospitalised elderly persons with acute cardiopulmonary syndromes, although interestingly the rate was approximately 4% among adults 45\u201364 years of age.",

This compared with infection rates of 7% for influenza and 52% for rhinovirus, but it should be noted that different diagnostic tests were used to detect the three viruses. In another study from the UK, Zambon et al.[41] used a sensitive nested RT-PCR to identify RSV in 15% of nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 167 patients >64 years of age with acute respiratory illnesses seen by general practitioners over a 3-year period. Influenza was identified in 28% of the same subjects. These results are similar to our finding that 11% of 287 winter illnesses in persons >65 years of age were a result of RSV infection when culture, EIA and RT-PCR were used for diagnosis.[40]",

More recently, several investigations have used more sensitive RT-PCR for diagnosis.[52\u201355] Rohde et al.[53] evaluated the presence of respiratory viruses in 85 subjects with a mean age of 70 years admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD and in 42 stable COPD patients admitted for other reasons. RSV was detected in 22% of exacerbations, and in none of the controls. RSV was the third most frequent virus detected after rhinovirus and influenza A virus. Although other investigators have also detected RSV by RT-PCR in patients with COPD exacerbations, they have also noted the equivalent presence of RSV RNA in clinically stable COPD patients.[55] These recent findings raise the possibility that RSV may persist in certain adults, a concept supported by recent observations by Schwarze et al.[56] using a murine model of RSV.",

In contrast, influenza A accounted for approximately 37 000 yearly deaths in the same age group. Using similar methods, Griffin et al.[59] estimated that among patients with chronic lung disease in Tennessee, USA, RSV caused 17.7 hospitalisations per 1000 persons and 46.5 deaths per 10 000 persons. It should be noted that these results were not calculated using virus-confirmed illnesses but rather were dependent upon several assumptions, including that viral circulation among infants reflects viral activity in elderly populations and that other winter time respiratory viruses do not confound the results.",

Symptoms range from a mild cold-like illness to severe respiratory failure.[62] The full spectrum of disease is best delineated from analysis of prospectively documented infections in senior daycare centres or in outpatient elderly populations.[32,39] In general, the clinical picture is indistinguishable from that of any of the other viral respiratory pathogens, with the exception that fever is less pronounced than for influenza. Rhinorrhoea and nasal congestion are seen in the majority, whereas sore throat is reported by about one-quarter of subjects. Similar to influenza infection, cough is nearly universal, being reported by >90% of infected subjects. Dyspnoea is reported by 11\u201320%, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms are extremely uncommon. On examination, the temperature exceeds 38\u00b0C in half or less of patients. Rales are noted in about one-third of patients and RSV is more apt to be associated with wheezing than is influenza, even in those without underlying obstructive lung disease. Radiographic abnormalities can be seen in patients with lower respiratory signs and symptoms, and are usually unilateral or bilateral patchy subsegmental alveolar infiltrates.[29] However, lobar consolidation was described by Dowell et al.[37] in hospitalised patients with pneumonia as a result of RSV. The role of bacterial superinfection during RSV infection in the elderly is not fully understood. We have noted bacterial pathogens occasionally, and isolated S. pneumoniae from the blood from several RSV-infected hospitalised patients (personal observation).",

In a nursing home study in which transit time of specimens to the laboratory was <1 hour, RSV was isolated in 45% of serologically proven RSV cases.[17] When tissue culture inoculation was performed at the bedside in another study, viral culture performed better and was 67% sensitive.[65] Unfortunately, in clinical practice, such methodology is not feasible and viral culture is only 20\u201330% sensitive compared with serology.",

A single high-CF titre has been used in a number of studies as indicative of acute RSV infection with some success, but this technique has not been rigorously studied.[18,23,24] When a \u22654-fold rise in titre is required for diagnosis, CF serology is approximately 50% sensitive when compared with EIA serology using purified viral proteins.[79] In a nursing home study using IgG EIA with purified F and G glycoproteins as antigens, 85% of subjects with culture-confirmed disease demonstrated \u22654-fold rises in RSV IgG.[17] When using preseason baseline sera, the sensitivity of serology EIA is closer to 90\u201395%.[80] Nonetheless, false-negatives may occur, particularly in hospitalised patients in whom acute sera is frequently obtained many days into illness. An interesting yet unexplained observation is that elderly adults have a significantly more vigorous serum antibody response to RSV than healthy young adults.[81] Therefore, serology may actually be a better method for diagnosing RSV in the old than in the young. Although sensitive and specific, serology based on IgG is limited by the need for convalescent specimens and, thus, diagnosis is retrospective. Serology is primarily a research tool, but it may be useful in outbreak investigations in long-term care facilities.",

The amount of virus in the lower airways of immunocompetent adults has been rarely studied. Using quantitative RT-PCR, German investigators found no difference in the titres of RSV in nasal lavage fluid of immunocompetent adults compared with induced sputum in COPD patients; however, respiratory viruses were more often detected in sputum.[52] Nonetheless, it may be reasonable to consider antiviral treatment in selected patients who present early with severe disease in whom a specific diagnosis of RSV infection has been made. Pre-emptive therapy may also be considered in high-risk patients or patients who are immunocompromised since a high percentage of these patients will develop serious lower respiratory tract disease.[85\u201387]",

Low serum neutralisation antibody has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for both infection and severe disease.[40,114] Unfortunately, at the present time, there is no licensed RSV vaccine although several candidate vaccines are in development. Immunisation with a purified F protein subunit vaccine was successful in inducing a 4-fold rise in antibody in 61% of healthy elderly and 47% of institutionalised elderly vaccine recipients.[115,116] However, the immunogenicity of a live attenuated RSV vaccine was poor in healthy elderly persons, presumably because of low infection rates.[117]",

RSV is second only to influenza as a cause of serious viral respiratory disease. Because of its nondistinctive clinical syndrome and difficulties with diagnosis, the virus remains a largely unrecognised cause of illness in elderly persons by internists and family practitioners. Continued research on therapy and methods of prevention are needed to reduce the substantive burden of RSV disease in the elderly.",
