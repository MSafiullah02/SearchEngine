There are myriad clinical and case management implications. Failure to appreciate the potential frequency of false positives and the consequent unreliability of positive test results across a range of scenarios could unnecessarily remove critical workers from service, expose uninfected individuals to greater risk of infection, delay or impede appropriate medical treatment, lead to inappropriate treatment, degrade patient care, waste personal protective equipment, waste human resources in unnecessary contact tracing, hinder the development of clinical improvements, and weaken clinical trials.

The EQAs provided participating laboratories with blind panels of positive and negative samples to assay, and received and analyzed the results. For each EQA we calculated the FPR as the number of negative samples reported as positive, divided by the total number of negative samples. Where we could only determine a range, we conservatively took the FPR as the lower bound of the range. In EQAs where no negative samples were reported as positive, we report the FPR in Table 1 as below a detection limit equal to the reciprocal of the total number of negative samples, but for analysis treated the FPR as zero. We calculated the median value and interquartile range of these FPR data and also of a subset restricted to EQAs where the total number of negative samples was >100. We used the lower of these medians and interquartile ranges to analyze the effects of false positives. From published studies we determined a range of FNR values to use in this analysis. We obtained test data and calculated test positivity rates for South Korea 1 and New York State, 2 representing regions with low and high positivity rates.",

In New York State, with FNR=20% and FPR=0.8%-4.0%, estimated FDR declined from 5-17% when positivity was lower in mid-March to 1-5% at the positivity peak on April 11 (Fig. 1D) . Test positivity was lower in South Korea. From the date of peak positivity to April 12 the estimated FDR rose from 14% to 37% if FPR=0.8%; it rose from 40-71% to 100% by different dates if FPR=2.3% or 4.0%, when the expected number of false positives was high enough to account for all of the positive test results (Fig. 1C ). If included in calculations, a high frequency of false positives reduces estimates of prevalence, which affect other key statistics, for example by increasing estimates of the hospitalization rate and death rate, Thus FDR rises as test programs sample populations with fewer infected individuals. This can result from programs continuing to implement broad-scale testing even as the prevalence of the virus in the general population declines, as appears to be the case in South Korea. Or it can result from expanding the scale of testing to include individuals who are less likely to be infected. Calls for mass testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be evaluated in light of the potential for the positive test results from broad-scale testing to be substantially comprised of false positives. Though broadening the scale of testing does generate more data, the quality of the generated data declines as it becomes increasing contaminated by false positives.",

The Patient's Fact Sheet for the US CDC's SARS-CoV-2 test states that there is only \"a very small chance\" that positive tests result could be wrong, but suggests that negative results could well be wrong. 16 Public health officials have similarly suggested that positive test results are absolutely reliable but negative results are untrustworthy. 17 In reality the opposite is true over a wide range of likely scenarios. For example, antibody tests indicate that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents of Santa Clara County, California is 2.49% to 4.16%. 18 At those prevalences, FPR=0.8%, and FNR=40%, the probability that a positive result is false is 24-34% while the probability that a negative result is false is 1.0-1.7%: it is 14-34 times more likely that a positive than a negative result is wrong. Positive results are more likely to be wrong than negative results at prevalences from 0-15%; with higher FPRs or lower FNRs, this remains true at higher prevalences. The explanation for this is straightforward. The FPR acts on samples from the uninfected fraction of the population, returning positive results for some uninfected individuals, while the FNR acts on the infected fraction, returning negative results for some infected individuals. When prevalence is low, the uninfected fraction is much greater than the infected fraction, so that even a low FPR can have a considerably larger effect than a high FNR.",

In practice, however, minute levels of contamination, which are extremely challenging to control, can produce false positives in PCR-based tests, and the potential for human error in sample handling or records management can probably never be entirely eliminated.

However, there is no apparent reason that SARS-CoV-2 protocols should produce significantly different FPRs, and we derived our model inputs conservatively from the EQA data. The EQA yielded FPR estimates on a per sample basis, and in analyzing the regional data we applied these to data aggregated on an individual basis, with some individuals tested multiple times. The individual-basis FPR may differ from the sample-basis FPR, but if the number of repeat tests is small relative to total tests the difference should be small.

With understanding of the potential frequency of false positives and their effects, clinicians, epidemiologists and those involved in critical public health decisions can avoid many of the pitfalls described in this paper. Second, EQAs of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic laboratories could be implemented to improve FPR estimates, and if designed appropriately, provide insight into the causes of intralaboratory false positives and facilitate their reduction. Efforts could also be made to assess the rate of false positives in sampling and sample transport. Third, false positives could be greatly reduced-though at the cost of increasing false negatives and consuming testing resources-by requiring two positive tests to count an individual as positive. This would ideally be done by taking two samples or splitting a sample at the point where it is taken, and sending each to different laboratories for analysis. Alternatively, false positives due to contamination at low concentrations could potentially be addressed by lowering the maximum Ct value for positive results, or by using primerprobe sets that are less sensitive. The resulting increase in FNR might be a reasonable trade-off for reduced FPR where test prevalence is low. Fourth, the rate of false positives in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests can be assessed retrospectively by antibody tests, though the accuracy of those tests may be similarly affected by false positives.",
