Briefly, the rabbit is a strict herbivore whose digestive system is adapted for the ingestion of a fibrous diet. Digestion in the stomach and small intestine is similar to monogastric animals and food that reaches the hindgut is mainly composed of fibre that cannot be broken down by the digestive enzymes of the stomach and small intestine. The rabbit has the ability to separate large fibre particles from small fibre particles in the proximal colon. The small particles and the large undigested particles are simultaneously sent in opposite directions. Large particles of undigested fibre pass distally and are excreted in hard faecal pellets. Small fibre particles are sent in a retrograde direction into the caecum where they undergo bacterial fermentation. Bacterial fermentation within the caecum releases volatile fatty acids that are absorbed as an energy source. The result of bacterial fermentation within the caecum is a fine paste containing amino acids, vitamins, enzymes, micro-organisms and volatile fatty acids.",

            "text": "Therefore, the rabbit\u2019s colon has a dual function. For most of the day, it mixes and separates ingesta, simultaneously sending indigestible particles towards the anus, and fermentable particles towards the caecum. Periodically, the motility of the proximal colon alters completely, and pasty caecal contents are directed along the colon to be expelled as soft faecal pellets or caecotrophs. Caecotroph production follows a diurnal rhythm. Most rabbits produce soft faeces during the morning and evening approximately 4 h after feeding. These caecotrophs are re-ingested directly from the anus to be digested in the stomach and small intestine as an additional source of nutrients for the rabbit. The nature of the intestinal contents, muscular activity, transit time and exchange of water and electrolytes alter according to the type of faeces passing through the colon. Therefore, digestion and colonic motility can be in either the \u2018hard faeces phase\u2019 or the \u2018soft faeces phase\u2019 (see Figure 1.4). The amount of ingesta and gas in the various sections of the digestive tract alters according to the phase of excretion. The size and shape of the caecum also follows a diurnal rhythm, which is an important consideration during abdominal palpation or radiography of rabbits.",

            "text": "Separation of ingesta in the proximal colon is accomplished by a combination of functional anatomy and colonic motility. Sacculations in the wall of the proximal colon (haustra) retain small particles while the larger particles accumulate in the lumen. Haustral activity directs small particles towards the caecum, while segmental activity directs large particles towards the anus. Lagomorphs have a specially adapted muscular segment of the colon known as the fusus coli that contains a large number of mucus glands (see Figure 1.5). The fusus coli acts as pacemaker for colonic motility. It is highly innervated and vascular and it is not only controlled by the autonomic nervous system but also subject to the effects of metabolites and hormones such as aldosterone and prostaglandins. During the excretion of caecotrophs, haustral activity ceases and caecal material is moved swiftly along the large colon. In the fusus coli, the material is formed into pellets that become encapsulated in mucus (see Figure 1.5). The transit time for soft faeces through the colon is 1.5\u20132.5 times faster than that for hard faeces (Fioramonti and Ruckesbusch, 1976).",

Water is secreted into the proximal colon during the process of mixing and separating and is sent into the caecum with the small particles. Water is absorbed from the caecum across the caecal wall into the circulation. The retention time of digesta within the caecum is affected by both caecocolonic motility and the nature of ingesta that reaches it. Conditions within the caecum are affected by the type and amount of nutrients that supply the microflora and the products of bacterial fermentation. The balance of micro-organisms in the caecum is of paramount importance to the health of the animal. A healthy microflora digests food efficiently. Any factor that upsets the balance of caecal microflora has the potential to result in the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria and cause disease.",

Changes in the amount and content of the ingesta that reaches the caecum have an effect on the balance of micro-organisms, which are therefore dependent on diet and intestinal motility. Bacteroides spp. predominate in a microflora composed of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and -negative rods, cocci, filaments, coccobacilli and spirochaetes. In addition to the aerobic flora, over 74 strains of anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the caecal mucosa and many of these species have not been cultivated (Straw, 1988). The microbial flora can contain small numbers of potential pathogens such as Clostridium spp. Stress has an effect on caecal microflora. Increased glucocorticoid levels increase coliform counts and narrow the aerobic-to-anaerobic bacteria ratio in the gut (Straw, 1988). Changes in the caecal microflora can be seen in Gram-stained smears of caecal contents. In the healthy rabbit, high numbers of large anaerobic metachromatic bacteria (LAMB) and protozoa are present. In rabbits suffering from mucoid enteropathy, a drop in the number of LAMB and protozoa and an increase in coliforms are found (Lelkes and Chang, 1987).",

Changes in caecal pH alter the caecal microflora and can result in the proliferation of pathogens. The proportions of volatile fatty acids in the caecum influence appetite and gut motility. In healthy rabbits, acetates predominate, followed by butyrates and propionates. Low fibre diets result in decreased acetates and increased propionates and butyrates. An increase in caecal butyrate inhibits normal peristalsis of the gut (Lang, 1981).",

In wild rabbits and those pet rabbits that eat a natural diet of grass and hay, a healthy gut flora that is resilient to any minor dietary changes that occur as the result of eating novel foods becomes established. In contrast, in intensive situations where large numbers of rabbits are kept in a small space and fed on artificial diets containing products that rabbits would not normally eat, alterations in the intestinal microflora can rapidly result in the proliferation of pathogens and the development of enteritis. Large numbers of pathogenic bacteria are most likely to be present in intensive situations. Commercial rabbits are young, growing animals, in which a healthy caecal microflora has not become established. Because of the financial importance of losses due to enteric disease in commercial units, extensive research has been carried out into the effects of varying dietary protein, carbohydrate and fibre levels on caecal microflora and volatile fatty acid production. These considerations are beyond the remit of this book, which is mainly concerned with the individual pet rabbit and not commercial rabbit production. The nutrition of the commercial rabbit is described in detail in P. R. Cheeke\u2019s Rabbit Feeding and Nutrition (Academic Press, Orlando, 1987) and reviewed in The Nutrition of the Rabbit (C. De Blas and J. Wiseman, eds) (CAB Publishing, Wallingford, Oxford, 1998).",

            "text": "It is not possible to consider any digestive problem in rabbits without examining the diet. The role of fibre and its \u2018digestibility\u2019 or \u2018indigestibility\u2019 is an important concept in the understanding of digestive disease in rabbits. Fibre digestion depends upon the presence of cellulolytic bacteria within the digestive tract. In rabbits the term \u2018digestibility\u2019 includes bacterial degradation or fermentation within the caecum, and not just digestion in the stomach and small intestine. For this reason, the term \u2018fermentable fibre\u2019 may be less confusing than \u2018digestible fibre\u2019. Bacterial fermentation of fibre within the caecum varies according to the chemical structure and particle size (see Figure 1.6). For example, hemicellulose is more digestible than lignin. Small particles enter the caecum where their digestibility is affected by their size. Smaller particles of fermentable fibre have a relatively greater surface area for bacteria to adhere to and are digested more quickly than the larger particles. Very large particles (> 0.5 mm) do not enter the caecum and are expelled, undigested, in the hard faeces. Although it has no nutritive value, indigestible fibre is an essential part of the diet because it stimulates gut motility, which sends nutrients and fluids into the caecum for bacterial fermentation. Insufficient indigestible fibre results in slow gut motility and retention of hair and ingesta in the stomach. Reduced motility in the proximal colon affects the separation of intestinal contents and reduces the supply of digesta and fluid to the caecum. Lack of both fermentable and indigestible fibre results in changes in caecal pH, volatile fatty acid distribution and the balance of microbial flora. Alterations in the populations of micro-organisms can allow enteric pathogens to proliferate. Therefore, although a low level of dietary fibre may not actually cause disease, it is a major predisposing factor. Additional factors such as coccidiosis or treatment with ampicillin are needed to cause pathological disease in commercial rabbits fed on a low fibre diet (Licois and Mongin, 1980). The caecal appendix is larger in rabbits on a low fibre diet, suggesting either an increased demand for the buffering effects of bicarbonate or an increase in lymphoid activity in response to greater production of bacterial toxins (Cheeke et al., 1986).",

High levels of indigestible fibre promote caecotroph ingestion, whereas high protein levels reduce it. More food is consumed by rabbits on a diet high in indigestible fibre, i.e. large particles of lignified plant material. However, processing the food to reduce the indigestible fibre down to particles small enough to enter the caecum will suppress appetite. Lignin is not digested by the caecal bacteria, whereas cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin are. Excessive amounts of ground lignified material in the caecum increase retention time and decrease digestibility (Chiou et al., 1998). Caecal impaction can be the result.",

The stomach pH of suckling rabbits is approximately 5\u20136.5. Adult rabbits have a stomach pH of 1\u20132, except during digestion of caecotrophs, when the pH rises. The high pH of suckling rabbits not only permits healthy bacteria to pass through the digestive tract and colonize the hindgut but also permits the passage of pathogens, such as pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli. Susceptibility to pathogenic strains of E. coli varies with age; rabbits of 3 weeks are more susceptible than rabbits of 6 weeks of age (Licois et al., 1992). Weaning is a stressful period for rabbits when healthy caecal microflora is not yet established and juvenile rabbits are susceptible to disease. Ingestion of maternal caecotrophs aids the population of the caecum with a healthy gut flora and early weaning and separation from the dam increase susceptibility to bacterial enteritis.",

Several animals sharing a small space increase faecal contamination and the risk of cross-infection.

Disturbances in water, electrolyte and acid\u2013base balance have a rapid and profound effect on health. Water and electrolytes are continually exchanged along the digestive tract and, in rabbits, any condition that affects this cycle of secretion and absorption also affects fluid and electrolyte balance (see Figure 1.4). Saliva is constantly produced by rabbits and, during the hard faeces phase, water is secreted into the stomach and proximal colon. It is then reabsorbed from the caecum and distal colon. Dehydration develops rapidly during intestinal disease, despite no obvious fluid loss in vomit or diarrhoea. Conditions that cause intestinal obstruction result in the accumulation of large amounts of fluid proximal to the site of obstruction. Conversely, gastrointestinal hypomotility reduces the secretion of water into the stomach and results in impaction of the contents. Dehydration is associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility, presumably due to decreased absorption of water from the stomach, caecum and distal colon.",

Many factors influence gastrointestinal motility in rabbits (see Box 8.1\n). Reduced gastrointestinal motility leads to impacted food in the stomach or caecum, impaired glucose absorption and a reduction in the supply of nutrients and fluids to the caecal microflora.Box 8.1Factors that affect gut motility\n\u2022\nPhase of faecal excretion: the nature and direction of the peristaltic waves alters with the excretion of hard or soft faeces. The fusus coli is a specially adapted area of the colon that acts as a differential pacemaker for the initiation of peristaltic waves in the proximal and distal colon. The fusus coli is under autonomic control. It is highly innervated and is influenced by hormones such as aldosterone and prostaglandins. Prostaglandin stimulates the excretion of soft faeces.\u2022\nIndigestible fibre: the passage of large particles of indigestible fibre through the colon stimulates intestinal motility as a result of intestinal distension.\u2022\nVolatile fatty acids in the caecum: an increase in caecal butyrate inhibits normal peristalsis of the gut. Low fibre diets result in decreased acetates and increased propionates and butyrates.\u2022\nMotilin: this is a polypeptide hormone secreted by enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum and jejunum. Motilin stimulates gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Fat stimulates and carbohydrate inhibits its release. In the small intestine, motilin activity is decreased aborally. It disappears in the caecum and reappears in the colon and rectum.\u2022\nPain and stress: cause adrenergic stimulation and inhibit gut motility.\u2022\nDisease: e.g. dysautonomia, coccidiosis, E. coli, rotavirus, enterotoxins, plant toxins can affect gut motility in different ways. For example, in rabbits with diarrhoea experimentally induced by coccidiosis, the motility of the caecum is increased and the motility of the ileum and jejunum is reduced (Fioramonti et al., 1981).\u2022\nPharmacological agents: e.g. prokinetics (improve gut motility), opioids (reduce gut motility), NSAIDs (can reduce prostaglandin stimulation of caecotroph production).\n",

It was thought that the trichobezoar caused a pyloric obstruction. Anorexia, weight loss, reduced faecal output, depression and death due to starvation were attributed to the presence of a trichobezoar. Many theories were put forward about the cause of trichobezoar formation. Handbooks and leaflets on rabbit care suggest that regular grooming is required to prevent excessive amounts of hair being swallowed and becoming impacted in the stomach. Some breeders still recommend one day a week without food for rabbits in order to \u2018clear the system\u2019 of ingested hair. Boredom, magnesium or copper deficiency, inadequate protein, individual caging and the presence of air filtration barriers have all been put forward as potential causes of trichobezoar formation (Ojerio and Ladiges, 1981). The rabbit\u2019s inability to vomit has also been cited as a contributory factor (Gillett et al., 1983). Treatment was usually unsuccessful. The administration of liquid paraffin to lubricate the gastric contents and that of pineapple juice to dissolve the hair enzymatically with bromelain were suggested as therapies. Surgical removal of the trichobezoar was a last resort and carried a poor prognosis. The association between trichobezoars and fatty liver was noted by many authors (Gillett et al., 1983, Ojerio and Ladiges, 1981). An association with pregnancy toxaemia was made by Patton et al. (1983). It is only in recent years that trichobezoars have been recognized as the result of anorexia rather than the cause. On post-mortem examination, the rabbit\u2019s stomach is never found to be empty (Okerman, 1988) and the presence of a small amount of fibrous food is normal. The presence of hair entangled in the food is also a normal finding because rabbits are continually grooming and ingesting large amounts of hair.",

Monthly radiographs were taken and the rabbits monitored closely for food intake and faecal output for 24 weeks after infusion. Gastrotomies were then performed to remove the foreign material and the rabbits monitored closely for a further 4 weeks prior to euthanasia and post-mortem examination. The presence of a latex bezoar did not have any adverse effect on appetite and weight gain of any of the 12 rabbits that were infused. In the same study, the stomach contents of 208 clinically healthy commercial rabbits were examined after slaughter and well-defined trichobezoars were found in 23% of them. This study cast doubt on the concept that trichobezoars cause anorexia. In 1986, Fekete and Bokori found elevated cortisol levels in rabbits with trichobezoars, although they concluded that the elevation was associated with the stress of having a trichobezoar rather than the trichobezoar being the result of stress. In 1987, Buckwell described the successful medical treatment of \u2018gut stasis\u2019 in rabbits exhibiting anorexia, reduced water intake, depression, weight loss and absence of faecal pellets. He described the presence of a palpable impacted mass in the region of the stomach. Treatment consisted of the administration of a motility stimulant, corticosteroid, oral fluid and the provision of hay. Since that time, trichobezoars have increasingly become recognized as the result, rather than the cause, of reduced gastrointestinal motility and are secondary to many other conditions.",

In one study by Jackson (1991), intestinal stasis occurred more frequently in a group of laboratory rabbits that were restrained without the use of a towel. Once towel wrapping was introduced for the restraint of all rabbits, the incidence of the trichobezoars fell dramatically and the author concluded that stress played a significant role in the cause of the disease. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system causes adrenal hormones to be released into the circulation. One of the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline is the inhibition of gastrointestinal motility. If gastrointestinal motility is reduced, water secretion into the stomach is also reduced and hair and ingesta accumulate and become impacted. The rabbit appears to be particularly susceptible to the effects of catecholamines on gut motility. In healthy rabbits with an uninterrupted daily routine, the passage of soft and hard faeces follows a circadian rhythm, with an average day-to-day variation of approximately 30 minutes. Stress or even alterations in routine can have a significant effect on the caecotrophic rhythm. Simply switching a light on during the normal period of darkness caused one rabbit to stop producing faeces for 10 days in a study of caecotrophic rhythm by Jilge (1980). Thunderstorms, bonfire night, predator attacks, pain and surgery can all slow gut motility and, if left untreated, result in impacted stomach contents and trichobezoar formation.",

Rabbits with slow gut motility crave fibre and will often eat hay or grass in preference to other foods.

Healthy pregnant rabbits show a period of insulin resistance between days 24 and 30 of gestation, during which high levels of insulin do not stimulate muscle glucose uptake (McLaughlin and Fish, 1994). Hepatic uptake of glucose and free fatty acids is also reduced in pregnant rabbits and brings about an arterial hyperglycaemia so more glucose is available to the uterus (Pere et al., 1992). Insulin resistance results in increased hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) activity, with increased amounts of triglyceride being hydrolysed from adipose tissue and transported to the liver.",

The onset of gastrointestinal hypomotility can be insidious and anorexic rabbits are often reasonably alert in the early stages. A reduced appetite and a reduction in faecal output are the early warning signs (Table 1.6). As the disease progresses, the rabbit becomes totally inappetent and depressed. It adopts a hunched appearance and may sit for hours, immobile in the corner of the cage or hutch. Affected rabbits do not groom and appear to be oblivious to their surroundings. They are no longer inquisitive and do not respond to being spoken to or the offer of an interesting titbit. The rabbit becomes clinically dehydrated. There are no specific clinical signs associated with the development of hepatic lipidosis but affected animals are depressed and unresponsive. In the terminal stages, they become totally inappetent and are often disorientated and ataxic. Hyperglycaemia occurs. Death is due to liver and kidney failure.",

Faecal output ceases completely and the impacted stomach can often be palpated as a hard mass behind the ribs, especially in the later stages of the disease. A blood sample can aid differential diagnosis, assist with choice of fluid therapy and offer prognostic indicators. A lipaemic sample or the presence of hyperglycaemia in conjunction with ataxia is a poor prognostic sign. In the early stages, hypoglycaemia may be found. This is treated by oral, subcutaneous or intravenous glucose therapy. In contrast, some rabbits show hyperglycaemia in the early stages of the disease associated with stress or pain. A blood glucose value within the normal reference range is reassuring. A PCV in excess of 40\u201345% indicates dehydration. Prerenal azotaemia is common in rabbits with gastrointestinal stasis. It is found in conjunction with dehydration. Blood urea and creatinine levels can be markedly elevated. If the analytical equipment is available, electrolyte status is invaluable. Once hepatic lipidosis is established, fatty infiltration of the kidneys occurs and the rabbit goes into liver and kidney failure. There can be a range of bizarre biochemistry results at this stage.Box 8.2Interpretation of abdominal radiographsThe rabbit\u2019s digestive processes follow a natural circadian rhythm that affects the appearance of abdominal radiographs. It is important to consider the time of day that an X-ray was taken, and whether the rabbit had recently ingested food.Hard faeces phaseDuring the phase of hard faeces formation and excretion, the stomach can contain large quantities of fibrous food. The caecum becomes progressively distended as ingested food passes down the small intestine and through the ileocolic junction. A full caecum and proximal colon gives the ventral abdomen a general mottled appearance. The outline of the caecum is sometimes visible. Hard faecal pellets are often seen in the distal colon. Small amounts of intestinal gas may be seen.Soft faeces phaseThe soft faeces phase is much shorter than the hard faeces phase and usually occurs during the morning. A small amount of food may be seen in the stomach. The caecal contents are expelled into the proximal colon so the caecum is reduced in size. The caecum may contain small quantities of gas. Hard faecal pellets are absent from the distal colon and rectum.Radiographic findings\n\u2022The stomach is situated within the costal arch and normally contains some food, which gives the organ a mottled appearance.\u2022The main body of the stomach lies on the left on the ventrodorsal view.\u2022The liver can be seen in the anterior abdomen, although the ventral border is not always clearly demarcated on the lateral view.\u2022The spleen cannot be seen radiographically.\u2022The small intestine cannot be distinguished from the long distal colon in the normal rabbit. Small pockets of gas may be seen in the intestines of normal rabbits.\u2022Obstruction or slowing of gut motility results in the accumulation of gas in parts of the digestive tract. Distended loops of bowel can be identified by their anatomical position (see Figure 8.2).\u2022The ileocaecocolic segment occupies most of the ventral abdomen. The appearance of the ileocaecocolic segment varies with the phase of digestion.\u2022Extraneous radiopaque material is sometimes seen in the digestive tract of rabbits that eat food that contains particles of soil or grit. Small particles are moved in a retrograde fashion into the caecum. Accumulations of sand or grit in the caecum should be differentiated from calcification in abscesses in organs such as the ovaries.\u2022Radiopaque deposits in the bladders are due to the presence of calcium carbonate in the urine. This is a normal finding. A solid radiopaque bladder suggests the presence of \u2018sludgy urine\u2019 (see Figure 12.2).\u2022The left kidney is usually clearly visible in the dorsal abdomen in the region of L3\u2013L5. The right kidney may be less obvious and is situated cranially in the region of T13\u2013L1. Renal length is approximately 1.25\u20131.75 times the length of the second lumbar vertebra (Hinton and Gibbs, 1982).\u2022The presence of intra-abdominal fat enhances the radiographic image of abdominal organs. The area cranial to the bladder is filled with fat deposited in the broad ligament in female rabbits and may be seen as a homogeneous grey area, especially in obese individuals.\u2022The uterus is not normally visible in the non-pregnant doe but may be seen if it is enlarged by pregnancy or disease.\u2022Nipples can be seen superimposed on the abdominal contents of some female rabbits. Nipples are rudimentary in males.\u2022Sometimes mineralization of ovaries, uterine tumours or intra-abdominal abscesses may be seen.\u2022Areas of calcification may be seen in association with soft tissue mineralization, chronic abscesses or in areas of fat necrosis. Hard areas of necrotic fat in the mesometrium can be a sequel to ovario-hysterectomy.\n",

The medical treatment of gastrointestinal hypomotility and the properties of therapeutic agents are summarized in Tables 8.2\nand 8.3\n. The general treatment of digestive disorders is given in Box 8.3\n. Nutritional support is important to prevent the development of hepatic lipidosis. Analgesics are always indicated, as gas accumulates in stagnant sections of the gastrointestinal tract, causing distension and pain, which compound the situation further.Box 8.3General principles of treatment of digestive disorders in rabbitsTreatment of digestive disease in rabbits is aimed at identifying, treating and removing the underlying cause, preventing dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, maintaining or restoring gut motility, protecting normal gut flora and preventing hepatic lipidosis. The dosages and properties of therapeutic agents are summarized in Table 8.3.\u2022Hospitalization is often necessary to permit observation of appetite and faecal output. Many rabbits with digestive disorders require fluid therapy, syringe feeding and medication by injection.\u2022A healthy rabbit passes copious quantities of hard faecal pellets. Up to 180 pellets a day can be passed by a rabbit that is eating well and on a high fibrous diet. Hard faeces are always passed overnight by a healthy rabbit. The absence of hard faeces is a significant finding.\u2022Small faeces, diarrhoea, uneaten or abnormal caecotrophs are easier to monitor in the hospitalized rabbit.\u2022Rabbits with diarrhoea should not be fasted like a dog or cat.\u2022Indigestible fibre is always required by all rabbits at all times and can be provided by a bed of good-quality, palatable hay.\u2022Fresh grass will tempt many rabbits to eat and is a good source of both indigestible and digestible (fermentable) fibre.\u2022Tempting fibrous vegetables can be offered to rabbits with diarrhoea, although fruit, lettuce and other salad items should be avoided.\u2022Anorexic rabbits can be offered a selection of fresh, appetizing leafy green foods. Even rabbits that do not normally eat greens can safely be offered freshly picked grass, dandelions, spring greens, cabbage, kale, carrots or apple.\u2022Syringe feeding is necessary for rabbits that have not eaten for more than 12 h.\u2022Fluid therapy is an essential part of treatment for anorexic or diarrhoeic patients. Oral or subcutaneous fluids can be given to rabbits that are not dehydrated but intravenous or intraosseous therapy is essential in advances cases. Fluid therapy is described in Chapter 3. The safest choice of fluid for most conditions in rabbits is lactated Ringer\u2019s or Hartmann\u2019s solution.\u2022Oral, subcutaneous or intravenous glucose is indicated in rabbits known to be hypoglycaemic from blood glucose measurements.\u2022Analgesia is essential for treating the pain associated with colic or gas distension of the bowel.\u2022There is a risk of gastric ulceration in anorexic rabbits and anti-ulcer therapy is indicated, especially in rabbits that have been anorexic for more than 48 h.\u2022Motility stimulants are indicated in the treatment of motility disorders. They are an essential part of treatment for gastric stasis and can also be used to treat caecal impaction and mucoid enteropathy.\u2022Antibiotics may be indicated for the treatment of enterotoxaemia and in some types of diarrhoea. Enrofloxacin, trimethoprim preparations and metronidazole are the least likely to cause disturbances in the gut flora. Metronidazole has been cited as a treatment of choice for enterotoxaemia caused by Clostridium spiroforme (Carman, 1994). Trimethoprim combinations can be used to treat coccidiosis.\u2022Some rabbits may be malnourished due to poor diet or dental disease and the inclusion of a vitamin supplement in the treatment protocol can be beneficial. Although rabbits synthesize vitamin C, there is evidence that vitamin C requirements of rabbits increase during periods of stress when plasma ascorbic acid has been shown to decrease significantly (Verde and Piquer, 1986).\u2022Anabolic steroids can be effective as an appetite stimulant for rabbits and have some beneficial effect in the retention of electrolytes. There appear to be no adverse effects at low doses.\u2022A probiotic can be used to introduce beneficial bacteria to the hindgut. There are many anecdotal reports of the efficacy of commercial probiotic preparations although they contain lactobacillus that is not a normal inhabitant of the rabbit gut. Alternatively, caecotrophs collected from a healthy rabbit can be used to introduce normal bacterial flora.\u2022Rabbits with digestive disorders are at risk of developing enterotoxaemia. Cholestyramine (Questran), an ion exchange resin, can be given to absorb enterotoxins.\n",

            "text": "Diet is a key part of the treatment of gastrointestinal hypomotility, and nutritional support will prevent the development of hepatic lipidosis. All anorexic rabbits must be encouraged to eat, and assist fed if they will not or are unable. Hepatic lipidosis can develop in any rabbit that becomes anorexic, although the risk is greater in obese, pregnant or lactating animals. Tempting foods such as fresh grass, dandelions and appetizing vegetables such as curly kale, spring greens, carrots and apples should be offered. Good-quality hay is important, both to stimulate appetite and to provide a sense of security to reduce stress levels. A bed of hay smells familiar. Grass and hay provide long particles of indigestible fibre that are important to stimulate gut motility. A quiet environment away from predators and barking dogs is important. In the initial stages (less than 24 h), analgesia and the provision of palatable fibre can be sufficient to stimulate gut motility and prevent progression of the disease. In the later stages (more than 24 h without food), syringe feeding is required to provide calories and fluid to soften and lubricate impacted stomach contents and provide water and electrolytes. Several proprietary brands of support feed are available for herbivores, and these should be fed as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Pur\u00e9ed vegetables or baby foods provide an easily assimilated digestible energy source that can be given through a syringe, although these are not sufficiently high in fibre. A source of fermentable fibre is important to provide nutrients for caecal bacteria. Indigestible fibre is difficult to administer through a syringe because the large particles clog the nozzle; however, purpose-made support foods do contain some. There is no point in attempting to grind indigestible fibre down for syringe feeding in an attempt to stimulate gut motility. Grinding fibre to a particle size where it no longer clogs a syringe means that the particles are small enough to be moved into the caecum instead of the colon and the stimulatory action on the gut is lost. Nasogastric tube feeding may be necessary as a last resort for intractable cases, but nasogastric tubes can be counterproductive. They clog up easily and an Elizabethan collar is required. Elizabethan collars have been proven to be stressful to rabbits (Knudtzon, 1988). Pharyngostomy tubes are somewhat more practical and are placed in much the same way as they are in cats. They have the advantage that being wider bore they are less likely to block; however, it is still difficult to get sufficiently fibrous food through. Pharyngostomy tubes also carry the risk of causing abscessation at the site of entry. The use of PEG tubes has been reported; however, this is not commonly done due to the risk of abscessation at the entrance site and the difficulty of inserting these in the rabbit. All three types of feeding tubes carry common disadvantages: they are unable to deliver food that will promote gut motility; they do not promote tooth attrition; and they have risks associated with their insertion. They are, however, a means to an end where otherwise a patient may die. Total parenteral nutrition has also been reported occasionally in rabbits; however, this is unlikely to be available outside of large referral institutions and is associated with the risks of sepsis, anaphylaxis, cholestasis and inflammation of the gut lining.",

They found no difference between the treated and untreated control samples and the authors concluded that none of the enzyme treatments exhibited any ability to dissolve hair.

            "text": "Rabbits are unable to vomit and therefore gastritis is more difficult to recognize than in the dog or cat. There are no specific clinical signs associated with gastric ulceration and inappetent rabbits are often already in pain from other causes. Anthropomorphically, it seems likely that gastric ulceration would add to the pain already being experienced. The clinical role of anti-ulcer preparations in the treatment of anorexic rabbits has not been evaluated but the possibility of gastric ulceration is a consideration when treating anorexic rabbits, especially when non-steroidal preparations have been administered. Several human preparations may be of use. Rabbits secrete high levels of gastric acid and pepsin in comparison with dogs, cats, rats and guinea pigs and the effects of anti-ulcer medications on gastric pH have been investigated (Redfern et al., 1991). Although omeprazole (Losec, AstraZeneca) is theoretically more effective than ranitidine (Zantac, GlaxoWellcome) in decreasing acid secretion and increasing postprandial pH, both preparations have a significant effect and appear safe as an adjunct to treatment of anorexia. Omeprazole is available in intravenous and capsule form for humans; ranitidine is available as an oral syrup. Ranitidine has the added advantage that it can also act as a prokinetic.Key Points 8.2Causes and effects of hypomotility\n\u2022For many years, the presence of impacted food material and hair within the stomach was believed to be a cause of anorexia and weight loss. Now, it is recognized that gastrointestinal hypomotility is the cause of impacted stomach contents (trichobezoars or \u2018hairballs\u2019) and anorexia and weight loss are the result.\u2022Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system inhibits intestinal motility. Gastrointestinal hypomotility is associated with any stressful situation or condition that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, including pain, surgery, stress or fright.\u2022A diet high in indigestible fibre stimulates gut motility and reduces the risk of gastrointestinal hypomotility.\u2022Gastrointestinal hypomotility results in gas formation in stagnant organs such as the stomach or caecum. Gas distension of the viscera is painful and abdominal pain stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and compounds the situation.\u2022Gastrointestinal hypomotility results in anorexia and a fall in glucose absorption from the stomach and small intestine. Volatile fatty acid production from the caecum is also reduced.\u2022Hypoglycaemia stimulates lipolysis and mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. Free fatty acids are metabolized as an energy source. Oxidation of free fatty acids releases ketone bodies that can cause ketoacidosis.\u2022Accumulation of free fatty acids in the liver results in the development of hepatic lipidosis. Fatty infiltration of other organs, such as the kidney, occurs and, ultimately, liver and kidney failure result in death of the rabbit.\u2022Obese rabbits that already have a fatty liver are especially prone to the development of hepatic lipidosis.\u2022Increased glucose demand during pregnancy and lactation increases susceptibility to hepatic lipidosis during periods of anorexia.\u2022Stimulating gut motility and maintaining a positive energy balance to prevent oxidation of fatty acids, ketoacidosis and hepatic lipidosis are essential parts of the treatment protocol for many digestive disorders in rabbits.\u2022Gastric ulceration is a common post-mortem finding in anorexic rabbits. Anti-ulcer treatment, such as ranitidine, can be used in rabbits.\n\n",

If the rabbit has been premedicated with low-dose (0.2 mL/kg) fentanyl/fluanisone to obtain the abdominal radiographs, it can subsequently be masked down with isoflurane to induce anaesthesia (see Box 4.6). Prior to surgery, blood samples should be taken to assess PCV, glucose and electrolyte status before commencing fluid therapy. The passage of a stomach tube is required to decompress the stomach and remove as much fluid and gas as possible. The stomach tube can remain in place throughout surgery. Endotracheal intubation is advisable. If the anaesthetic induction agent does not contain an analgesic such as fentanyl/fluanisone, pre-emptive analgesia with butorphanol or buprenorphine is also required.",

            "text": "The abdomen is opened with a midline incision in the region of the umbilicus. In many cases, the small intestine lies just beneath the incision and is easily recognized. It is visibly distended with gas and fluid cranial to the obstruction. The topographical anatomy of the small intestine and its relationship to other abdominal organs is illustrated in Figure 8.5. Once the obstruction is located, the intestinal loop can be exteriorized and the surrounding tissues protected by sterile absorbent material. The intestinal contents are milked away from the obstruction before applying bowel clamps or asking an assistant to occlude the intestine with digital pressure. The enterotomy incision is made along the antimesenteric edge of the intestine distal to the foreign body to avoid placing sutures in devitalized tissue. The foreign body is removed and any everted mucosa trimmed off before suturing the wound with a single layer of appositional interrupted sutures, making sure that they include the submucosa (see Figure 13.1). A fine inert, absorbable monofilament suture material with a high tensile strength is required, such as 5/0 poliglecaprone (Monocryl) or polydioxanone (PDS II, Ethicon). The repair of an intestinal incision is difficult due to the small diameter of the organ and the friability of the tissue. It is important to avoid stenosis as much as possible as it increases the possibility of re-obstruction at a later date. If enterectomy is indicated, the intestine should be sectioned at a slight angle to preserve its antimesenteric vascularity. Although techniques such as side-to-side or side-to-end anastomosis can be performed, they have no advantage over an end-to-end anastomosis, which is technically simpler (Bouvy and Dupr\u00e9, 1997). A good seal to prevent leakage of intestinal contents is necessary as omentalization is difficult in rabbits due to the small omentum. Post-surgical adhesions to other organs form readily.",

Metabolites and hormones affect the rabbit\u2019s appetite for caecotrophs (Fekete, 1989). When food is scarce, all caecotrophs are consumed. When food is available ad libitum, the amount of caecotrophs consumed is influenced by the protein and fibre content of the diet. Increased levels of fibre increase caecotrophy, whereas high protein levels reduce it. Increasing the indigestible fibre component of the diet not only stimulates the rabbit to eat the caecotrophs but also makes the pellets firmer and less sticky. Healthy rabbits that eat a high fibre diet will consume all their caecotroph, whereas rabbits that are fed ad libitum on low fibre cereal diets will often leave caecotrophs uneaten. On some diets, particularly where certain herbs or legumes are included, the soft faeces appear less attractive than usual and are not ingested (Lang, 1981). Many diseases alter normal caecotrophic function, either by altering the consistency and composition of the caecotrophs or by interfering with the ingestion of caecotrophs from the anus (see Figure 8.6\n).",

The perineum of a rabbit is a very sensitive area and if the skin is sore, the rabbit may be reluctant to groom the area and ingest caecotrophs as they arrive at the anus. A vicious circle is formed, which results in sore, inflamed infected perineal skin (see Figure 7.3).

They are usually unwell and inappetent.\u2022The consistency of caecotrophs can be soft or liquid and can mimic diarrhoea. Change in routine or dietary change such as the introduction of salad items or soft fruit can result in production of soft caecotrophs.\u2022Several clinical conditions can either reduce a rabbit\u2019s appetite for caecotrophs or prevent a rabbit from consuming caecotrophs from the anus.\u2022Uneaten caecotrophs can become entangled in the fur around the anus and cause a superficial pyoderma in the skin beneath.\u2022Treatment of uneaten caecotrophs is aimed at identifying and treating the underlying cause, clearing up any skin infection, improving the rabbit\u2019s appetite for caecotrophs and improving their consistency so they are not so sticky.\u2022Decreasing dietary protein and increasing dietary fibre increase the rabbit\u2019s appetite for caecotrophs.\u2022Increasing dietary fibre also results in caecotrophs of a firmer consistency.\u2022True diarrhoea should be viewed as an emergency, as electrolyte and fluid balance disturbances can be rapid and significant.

Increasing the fermentable fibre content of the diet does have an effect on caecotroph consistency because small fibre particles are moved into the caecum. Most sources of fibre are a mixture of fermentable and indigestible fibre, so increasing the overall fibre content of the diet is likely to increase the amount of fermentable fibre that reaches the caecum. Increasing dietary fibre also increases appetite for caecotrophs and the amount of soft faeces produced (Caraba\u00f1o and Piquer, 1998).",

            "text": "The consistency of soft faeces is also influenced by the water content. Water is absorbed from soft faeces during their passage through the colon and variations in transit time can lead to changes in consistency in soft faeces. The introduction of novel foods, especially succulent items such as lettuce or fruit, can alter the consistency of caecotrophs so they are more liquid. This transitory change could be due to alterations in the transit time or changes in the caecal microflora. Dietary starch levels have no effect on the chemical composition of caecal contents or on the composition of hard or soft faeces (Caraba\u00f1o et al., 1988). The approach to treatment of uneaten caecotrophs is summarized in Box 8.4\n. In the short term, treatment is directed at clipping and cleaning the perineum and identifying the cause of uneaten caecotrophs. In the long term, dietary modification and weight reduction are required.Box 8.4Treatment of uneaten caecotrophs and perineal soilingRabbits with \u2018sticky bottoms\u2019 can be a challenge to treat successfully. The first step is to clean and treat the soiled perineum. The next step is to identify and treat the underlying cause (see Figure 8.6).In the short term\n\u2022Soiled fur should be carefully clipped away from the perineum. Simply bathing the area can be counterproductive, as it leaves the fur soiled and damp and leads to infection of the underlying skin.\u2022If the skin is inflamed, analgesia is indicated. Analgesics can also bring about a temporary respite from caecotroph production that is beneficial. Non-steroidal analgesics reduce caecotroph production by inhibiting endogenous prostaglandin synthesis (Pairet et al., 1986). Meloxicam or ketoprofen has a greater influence on prostaglandin production than carprofen. Soft faeces production also appears to be temporarily reduced after sedation with narcotic analgesics, especially fentanyl/fluanisone (Hypnorm, Janssen).\u2022Analgesics also alleviate pain from spinal problems or arthritis, which may be preventing a rabbit from grooming and cleaning the perineal region.\u2022Systemic antibiotics do not improve the consistency or reduce the production of soft faeces, although they may be beneficial in treating the perineal dermatitis. A \u2018safe\u2019 antibiotic such as enrofloxacin or trimethoprim that is unlikely to cause antibiotic-associated diarrhoea should be selected.\u2022In the early stages, plenty of good-quality hay or grass is required. Grass is ideal as it contains a mixture of fermentable and indigestible fibre and is palatable to most rabbits. A gradual dietary change will be required in the long term.\u2022Probiotics may play a part in establishing a healthy caecal microflora.\nIn the long term\n\u2022Dietary modification is of paramount importance in altering the consistency of the caecotrophs and stimulating the rabbit\u2019s appetite for them.\u2022Increasing the amount of fibre in the diet and reducing the amount of high calorie treats and cereals increases the rabbit\u2019s appetite for caecotrophs and makes them more fibrous and less sticky.\u2022Cereal mixtures should be reduced or withdrawn and substituted with small amounts of complete rations. Treat foods such as chocolate should be cut out altogether. Vegetables, but not fruit, may be offered, introducing one new item every few days, starting with the more fibrous varieties such as spring cabbage or broccoli. Apples, carrots and garden weeds such as dandelions can be introduced later. Soft fruit and salad items such as cucumber, lettuce and tomatoes are not necessary and should be avoided altogether in rabbits that have a tendency to not to eat soft caecotrophs.\u2022The introduction of fibrous green foods and vegetables is beneficial in increasing the fibre content and reducing the calorie content of the diet. In the short term, the introduction of new foods can unbalance the caecal flora, alter the consistency of the soft faeces and compound the problem. Therefore, dietary modification should take place gradually.\u2022Obesity is one of the main causes of perineal soiling, and weight reduction is an essential part of the treatment (see Chapter 2). Exercise is also important.\u2022Weight reduction and dietary modification may only be partially effective in resolving the problem in rabbits that have deep perineal folds. In obese animals, the skin folds often persist after the rabbit has lost weight. Surgical removal of the skin folds is a simple and effective remedy.\nLong-term management of incurable cases of perineal soilingIn some cases of perineal soiling, the underlying cause cannot be removed and the owner will have to manage the problem for the lifetime of the rabbit. Other steps may be needed, in addition to modifying the diet to alter the consistency of caecotrophs.\n\u2022Fluffy-coated breeds require constant grooming and clipping in the area around the tail and genitalia to prevent the hair becoming long and forming mats. Rabbits with maloccluded or no incisors require regular grooming in that area.\u2022Enough space is required for the rabbit to move away from soiled bedding and decrease the likelihood of caecotrophs sticking to the fur.\u2022Caecotroph production follows a circadian rhythm. Caecotrophs are usually produced during the morning. Observation of the individual rabbit\u2019s excretion pattern and changing the bedding accordingly can minimize soiling of the fur.\u2022Long-term NSAID analgesic therapy may be helpful in the treatment of underlying spondylitic or arthritic conditions.\n",

In the adult pet rabbit, caecal impaction occurs sporadically. Like gastric stasis, there is often a history of a stressful situation (see Figure 8.7\n). Dehydration may play a part in the aetiopathogenesis. It is known that feeding small fibre particles that absorb water can cause caecal impaction. Bulk laxatives, such as methylcellulose or psyllium, are examples. Ground-up lignified material can have a similar effect. Small particles, such as clay cat litter, can also become impacted as they are moved into the caecum during mixing and separation of ingesta in the proximal colon.",

Medical treatment is directed at providing nutrition, relieving pain, promoting gastrointestinal motility, softening the caecal contents and promoting caecal evacuation. Fluid therapy by all routes, intravenous, subcutaneous and oral, is indicated, plus liquid paraffin. All those foods reputed to cause \u2018diarrhoea\u2019 such as lettuce or fruit may tempt an inappetent rabbit to eat and provide additional fluid in addition to stimulating intestinal motility. As in all gastroenteric conditions in rabbits, good-quality hay or fresh grass must be constantly available as a source of indigestible fibre. Motility stimulants such as cisapride and metaclopramide can be useful in stimulating motility, although their effect on caecal motility in rabbits is not clear. Sometimes, motility stimulants appear to cause stomach cramps, perhaps due to their effects on the impacted organ. Analgesics are indicated, although, theoretically, interference with prostaglandin production by non-steroidal analgesics could have an inhibitory effect on the fusus coli. Carprofen is a weak cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor and therefore has less effect on prostaglandin production than some other NSAIDs. Non-steroidal analgesic therapy could contribute to gastric ulceration, which is often a post-mortem feature of anorexic rabbits, and anti-ulcer treatment with ranitidine or omeprazole is indicated.",

Van der Hage and Dorrestein (1996) described the clinical findings, pathological lesions and microscopic and transmission electron microscopic features of the coeliac ganglia of 19 rabbits with mucoid enteropathy.

The disease is occasionally encountered in adult pet rabbits, especially after a stressful incident such as transport or parturition. It is known that increasing the amount of indigestible fibre in the diet of newly weaned rabbits significantly reduces the incidence of mucoid enteropathy. Stress appears to play a major role in the development of the disease. Enzyme deficiencies, infectious agents and enterotoxins have all been cited as other possible causes. Inflammation is not a feature of the disease and intestinal hypomotility or changes in the acidity of the caecum have been proposed as aetiological factors (Lelkes and Chang, 1987). Investigations are often hampered by the presence of concurrent infections such as coccidiosis, Tyzzer\u2019s disease or opportunist pathogens such as Clostridium spp. or E. coli.",

In rabbits, mucus production is a response of the hindgut to untoward stimuli (Bergdall and Dysko, 1994) and is not necessarily specific to mucoid enteropathy. Experimentally, ligation of the caecum results in a mucoid enteropathy-like syndrome in some rabbits, with large amounts of mucus production in the colon. Incorporating the nerves and blood vessels in the ligature increases the likelihood of inducing a mucus hypersecretion 3\u20135 days after surgery (Hotchkiss and Merritt, 1996a). Surgical removal of the caecum does not result in mucus production, whereas filtrates from the ligated caecum administered to in vitro sections of colon do stimulate mucus secretion. Injection of oxytetracycline into the ligated caecum prevents colonic mucus secretion, suggesting that a bacterial secretory product is the stimulus for excessive goblet cell secretion characteristic of mucoid enteropathy. Hotchkiss and Merritt (1996b) postulated a blood-borne factor (termed mucus-stimulating substance or MSS) is present that binds to receptors on goblet cells causing mucus release. Serum from rabbits suffering from ME causes increased mucus secretion when applied to Sipunculus nudus, a mucus-secreting coelomate. Mucus secretion is also stimulated in the respiratory tract. Injections of cholestyramine into the ligated caecum can prevent the development of mucoid enteropathy-like symptoms, suggesting the presence of some type of toxin (Toofanian and Targowski, 1983).",

            "text": "Most rabbit breeders do not present cases of mucoid enteropathy to veterinary surgeons for diagnosis and treatment. Affected animals are culled or treated with a variety of home remedies. As a result, there is much confusion about the disease and there are claims of success with many different treatments, including antibiotics. In most cases, it is not clear whether the treatments were effective against other diseases, such as respiratory or enteric pathogens or coccidiosis rather than mucoid enteropathy. In commercial units, affected rabbits are often not treated, although antibiotic therapy can be instigated, either prophylactically or therapeutically. Mucoid enteropathy is not common in pet rabbits. It may be seen in the newly acquired baby rabbits from the pet shop or breeder, or in an adult stressed by parturition, transport or a change of home. In these circumstances, the individual rabbit is valuable to the new owner and treatment is often requested. However, the prognosis is poor and most cases die despite aggressive treatment. Treatment is non-specific and follows the same principles as for other digestive disorders (see Tables 8.2 and 8.3 and Box 8.3). Frequent enemas have been recommended (Breitweiser, 1997). The role of antibiotics is unclear, although many breeders believe that antibiotics are effective. In advanced cases, euthanasia is the most humane choice.Key Points 8.5Caecal impaction\n\u2022Onset is often insidious.\u2022The caecum may be palpated as a firm sausage-shaped mass in the ventral abdomen.\u2022The condition is painful and analgesia is indicated. Opiates do not block prostaglandin production; this is important because prostaglandins stimulate caecal emptying. These should be used in preference to NSAIDs.\u2022If NSAIDs are used, those drugs which are weak cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as carprofen may be preferable.\u2022Occasionally caecal impactions can move and cause colonic obstruction. This leads to the caecum distending with gas (this may be visible radiographically) and the rabbit becoming rapidly depressed and anorexic.\u2022Treatment involves pain relief, fluid therapy and prokinetic medications. In the 2002 edition of this book, Frances Harcourt-Brown stated that some success was achieved using synthetic prostaglandins in treating this condition.\u2022Caecal impactions can be caused by feeding small-particle fibre that absorbs water, such as bulk laxatives.\u2022Caecal impaction may be part of a larger spectrum of signs in diseases such as dysautonomia or mucoid enteropathy.\n\nKey Points 8.6Dysautonomia\n\u2022Dysautonomia, similar to equine grass sickness or Key\u2013Gaskell syndrome in cats, has been identified in rabbits.\u2022There is loss of both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve function. This results in reduced gut motility, particularly in the caecum.\u2022In the terminal stages, gastric dilatation and aspiration pneumonia can occur.\u2022The diagnosis may be confirmed at post-mortem histopathological examination of autonomic ganglia.\u2022There is no known treatment, although some cases may respond to supportive care and long-term management.\n\nKey Points 8.7Mucoid enteropathy\n\u2022The aetiology of this disease is unknown, although faecal-oral transmission has been suspected and either a bacterial toxin or other agent found in the serum of affected rabbits is postulated to cause the signs displayed.\u2022The hallmark of this disease is massive mucus secretion into the colon, without notable associated inflammation. The mucus secreted can be enough to plug the colon with a gelatinous mass.\u2022The caecal contents become inspissated and solid, adhere to the caecal wall and may obstruct the ileocaecal junction.\u2022Clinical signs include abdominal distension, depression, crouched stance and \u2018sloshy\u2019 sounding guts. Tooth grinding is common.\u2022Disruption of normal faecal output is one of the first signs of mucoid enteropathy. Diarrhoea and/or mucus may be seen in the early stages, followed by cessation of faecal output and abdominal distension.\u2022Mucoid enteropathy can occur concurrently with other enteric diseases such as Tyzzer\u2019s disease or colibacillosis.\u2022The prognosis is poor; however, some rabbits respond to intensive therapy that includes antibiosis, pain relief, fluid therapy and prokinetic drugs.\n\n",

Wild rabbits can be infected and transmission occurs by the ingestion of sporulated oocysts in food that has been contaminated by faeces. Sporulation of the oocysts is required for infectivity and requires at least 2 days outside the host. Oocysts are extremely resistant and can remain viable in soil, on vegetation and fomites for long periods of time (Harkness and Wagner, 1995). Recently, voided faeces do not contain oocysts that are infective (Harkness, 1997) as a prepatent period in the presence of oxygen is required for development. Eimeria stiedae has a slightly different life cycle to the intestinal Eimeria spp. Ingested oocysts hatch in the duodenum and sporozoites penetrate the intestinal mucosa before being transported to the liver, either in the blood- stream or in macrophages in the lymphatic system. Replication takes place in the mesenteric lymph nodes before transport via the hepatic portal circulation to the liver where they enter bile duct epithelial cells. Here the life cycle is completed with the ultimate release of oocysts into the bile duct. The prepatent period lasts for 15\u201316 days and oocysts are found in the faeces for at least 10\u201314 days after this (Owen, 1992).",

In an individual rabbit, hepatic coccidiosis can be treated with sulpha drugs (Schmidt, 1995); however, the changes in the liver are irreversible, and some authors (Harkness et al., 2010) feel the disease is essentially untreatable. Commercial pellets often contain a coccidiostat to prevent clinical disease in rabbit colonies while allowing an immunological response to confer immunity. Treatment of established disease can be problematic, as rabbits that are not eating well will not receive the medication in the feed. Medical treatment must be combined with suitable cleaning and disinfection procedures in order to be successful. In a comparative study of the response of rabbits infected with E. stiedae to treatment with sulphaquinoxaline, robenidine, methyl benzoquate, clopidol and a mixture of methyl benzoquate and clopidol, only sulphaquinoxaline and the combination of methyl benzoquate and clopidol gave satisfactory control of the parasite (Joyner et al., 1983). Toltrazuril (Baycox, Bayer) in the drinking water is highly effective in reducing oocyst output of intestinal and hepatic Eimeria spp. A regimen of 2 days\u2019 treatment repeated after 5 days reduces clinical signs and allows the development of immunity (Peeters and Geeroms, 1986, Redrobe et al., 2010).",

Intestinal coccidiosis causes inappetence, weight loss and chronic diarrhoea, which can be blood tinged. Animals affected with hepatic coccidiosis are often thin, pot-bellied and small for their age. Occasionally icterus is seen. Mixed infections occur. Raised bilirubin values in rabbits of this age are virtually pathognomonic for hepatic coccidiosis, especially in conjunction with other biochemical evidence of liver damage such as a raised AST, ALT, gamma GT and alkaline phosphatase values. Coccidial oocysts may be evident in the faeces. By the time the animals are presented for treatment they are often recovering from infection. If the rabbit is active and eating well, the prognosis is usually good with administration of sulpha drugs. Paediatric suspension of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can be used to treat the individual patient (see Table 8.3). A well-balanced diet is also required as the hepatic coccidiosis interferes with vitamin metabolism.Key Points 8.8Intestinal and hepatic coccidiosis\n\u2022Several species of Eimeria can cause intestinal coccidiosis. Eimeria magna and E. irresidua are the most pathogenic.\u2022Hepatic coccidiosis is caused by E. stiedae.\u2022Intestinal coccidiosis presents as an outbreak of diarrhoea, particularly in weanlings of 1\u20133 months of age. Clinical signs include inappetence, weight loss, fluid/mucoid faeces (sometimes containing blood), reduced body temperature and increased thirst. Rabbits may die without clinical signs if infection is acute.\u2022Hepatic coccidiosis presents as anorexia, failure to thrive, reduced weight gain, icterus, diarrhoea and death (up to 50% mortality in young na\u00efve rabbits). Weanling rabbits (5\u20138 weeks old) are most susceptible.\u2022Diagnosis of both types of coccidiosis is based on identification of coccidian oocysts in the faeces, in conjunction with histological examination of postmortem specimens.\u2022Treatment of coccidiosis relies on improved cleaning and disinfection of premises, reduction of stocking density, in addition to the use of sulpha drugs or toltrazuril. In commercial rabbitries coccidiostats may be added to feed.\n\n",

The disease is caused by Clostridium spp. that are anaerobic Gram-positive bacilli capable of producing powerful enterotoxins. The organisms can reside in the gut without causing disease but under certain conditions will rapidly proliferate and cause a severe enteritis. Clostridium spiroforme is a major pathogen in rabbit enterotoxaemia, although Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens may also be involved (Perkins et al., 1995). Pathogenic rabbit strains of C. spiroforme are different from non-pathogenic strains in other species. A similar pathogenic strain has been isolated from humans affected with diarrhoea (Carman, 1993). Rabbit isolates of C. spiroforme produce a toxin that is neutralized by antiserum to C. perfringens type E iota toxin. Virtually all rabbit isolates of C. spiroforme are toxigenic, although this is not the case in other species. Clostridium difficile produces two exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B. Toxin A is a lethal enterotoxin that binds to specific enteroreceptors and induces fluid secretion, mucosal damage and intestinal inflammation. Toxin B is a potent cytotoxin that interacts synergistically with toxin A (Perkins et al., 1995).",

Low fibre, high carbohydrate diets are associated with enterotoxaemia in commercial units. Recently weaned rabbits are most susceptible. Young rabbits do not digest and absorb starch as efficiently as adults (Blas and Gidenne, 1998) and carry a greater risk of unabsorbed carbohydrate reaching the caecum to act as a bacterial substrate. Substantial amounts of glucose are required by C. spiroforme for toxin production. There is a marked difference in starch digestibility between adult and growing rabbits. In adult rabbits, carbohydrate is hydrolysed and absorbed before it reaches the caecum. Enterotoxaemia in adult pet rabbits is not associated with a high carbohydrate diet but usually follows a disruption of the gut flora by antibiotics, other pathogens, toxins or stress. Experimentally, enterotoxaemia can be induced by oral administration of clindamycin. The accidental inclusion of lincomycin in the diet of commercial rabbits has resulted in clinical outbreaks.",

            "text": "Rotaviuses are enveloped RNA viruses that are particularly associated with diarrhoea in young animals. They are host-specific. Rotavirus has been associated with outbreaks of enteritis, usually in rabbits under 6 weeks of age. In most cases, diarrhoea is mild (Thouless et al., 1996). Rotavirus was originally isolated from weanling rabbits with diarrhoea, although it has also been recovered from unaffected animals (Bryden et al., 1976). Serological tests have revealed that rotavirus infection is widespread in colonies of domestic rabbits. The disease has been reported in many parts of the world, including Japan, Europe, Canada and the USA (DiGiacomo and Mare, 1994). In infected colonies, adult animals are seropositive and confer maternal immunity on their offspring. The young rabbits become infected when maternal immunity wears off, which coincides with weaning. Infected rabbits shed virus in faeces, which is probably the main route of transmission, although there is evidence for airborne spread. Severity of clinical signs depends on virus strain, intercurrent disease, immune status and all the other factors involved in enteric disease in weanling rabbits. In a study by Thouless et al. (1996), it was found that concurrent infection with rotavirus and E. coli resulted in increased mortality and morbidity due to diarrhoeal disease compared with infection with E. coli alone.",

In many cases, diseases are treated with home remedies or by culling affected stock. Half-truths, myths and legends abound, although some traditional remedies have a grain of truth or some sound common sense in them. Professional veterinary advice is seldom sought except when a disease threatens all the stock, a prize-winning bloodline or perhaps a particularly valuable individual. Expense is always an issue. Cases of enteritis can be difficult and expensive to investigate and treat. Prompt, detailed post-mortem examinations and laboratory investigations are required. The causes are often multifactorial and home visits to examine the stock and assess the husbandry may be needed. Successful treatment of individual rabbits with enteric conditions is difficult and usually expensive. Intensive therapy, including intravenous fluids, hospitalization and nursing, is required despite the breeder\u2019s expectation that some \u2018wonder drug\u2019 will provide an instant cure. Therefore compromises must be made and general principles applied to prevent further losses. Post-mortem examination is extremely valuable and all dead rabbits should be examined, not just one or two, as soon after death as possible. Microscopic examination of impression smears, gut contents and faeces can be a cheap way of obtaining information. A provisional diagnosis of mucoid enteropathy, coccidiosis or enterotoxaemia can be made from post-mortem examination, although concurrent infections can be present.

It may be advisable for breeders to take a break in their breeding programme and reduce stocking density so they have no young susceptible rabbits on the premises for a few weeks. A break gives the opportunity to clean and disinfect the premises thoroughly, and reduce the number of pathogens in the environment. Simply washing cages and hutches thoroughly in hot water and detergent to remove organic debris is beneficial and can be followed by the use of a disinfectant that kills viruses and bacteria. Povidone\u2013iodine compounds such as Tamodine (Vetark) or non-irritant Virkon can be used. Coccidial oocysts are particularly resistant to disinfection but are susceptible to desiccation. The use of a blowtorch to flame hutches is a simple method of killing oocysts or a 10% solution of ammonia is effective (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994). Ammonia is unpleasant and potentially hazardous to handle. Soil may need to be removed and replaced in outdoor enclosures. The introduction of a feed containing a coccidiostat can be required in the long term.Key Points 8.10Investigating and controlling disease outbreaks\n\u2022Many disease outbreaks have multifactorial causes, so robust investigation is required.\u2022Many instances of disease within a colony do not reflect a single pathogen; concurrent infections can be significant.\u2022Questions to ask include:1.What clinical signs are being exhibited?2.What age range of rabbits is affected?3.What percentage/number of rabbits are affected?4.What medications have already been administered?5.What is the policy regarding moving individuals in/out of the colony? (quarantine protocols)6.What is the cleaning/disinfection protocol?\n\u2022Site visits are very useful for assessing hygiene and stocking levels.\u2022Diagnostics will be required: post-mortem examination (including scrapes of gut lining, and histopathology), faecal examination, bacterial culture and serology. The diagnostics chosen should reflect a logical diagnostic plan in order to get the most relevant information.\u2022Basic strategies for controlling infectious disease should include:1.Stop stock moving in and out of the colony, and maintain as a closed community.2.Reduce stocking density and consider removing all vulnerable age classes for a period of time to allow disinfection.3.Maximize nutrition and ensure that sufficient fibre is being fed.4.Comprehensive cleaning and disinfection should be undertaken. This must include removal of organic debris as well as use of a suitable disinfection agent. The disinfectant must contact the clean surfaces for the effective amount of time in order to kill the organism in question. Using a blowtorch to burn the inside of wooden hutches can be a good option, as liquid disinfectants are less effective on porous surfaces.5.Advise staff on fomite transmission, and institute appropriate measures to avoid this: i.e. foot baths, hand-washing, changing clothes, not mixing utensils between groups, ordering which animals are attended to and when. Healthy animals should be first, proceeding to the sickest last. Different staff for each group could be considered.\n\u2022Preventing disease outbreaks is often easier than controlling them. Put a long-term plan in place including preventive medicine, surveillance diagnostics, stock control, hygiene and optimizing nutrition.\n\n",
