A vaccine that induces broad immunity to prevent K88 and F18 fimbrial ETEC bacterial attachment and colonization in pig small intestines and to neutralize enterotoxin enterotoxicity would be effective for PWD. Structure-based multiepitope-fusion-antigen (MEFA) technology using a backbone immunogen to present neutralizing epitopes of representing virulence factors capacitates development of broadly protective ETEC vaccines. Neutralizing epitopes have been identified from K88 fimbrial adhesin (FaeG) and enterotoxins but not F18 fimbrial adhesin. In this study, we in silico identified immunodominant epitopes from F18ac fimbrial subunit FedF which plays a critical role in F18 fimbrial adherence, genetically fused each epitope to a carrier, examined immunogenicity of each epitope fusion, and determined epitope-derived antibodies neutralizing activities against F18 fimbrial adherence. Data showed that seven immune-dominant epitopes were identified from FedF subunit. Fused to heterologous human ETEC adhesin subunit CfaB, epitope fusions induced anti-F18 antibodies in subcutaneously immunized mice. Moreover, antibodies derived from each fusion significantly blocked adherence of a F18-fimbrial E. coli bacteria to pig intestinal cell line IPEC-J2. While all seven epitopes exhibited neutralizing activity, results from this study identified FedF epitopes #3 (IPSSSGTLTCQAGT) and #7 (QPDATGSWYD) the most effective for antibodies against F18 fimbrial adherence, and suggested their future application in PWD vaccine development.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) is one of the most important swine diseases (Fairbrother et al., 2005; USDA, 2002) . Piglets commonly develop diarrhea 3-10 days after they are weaned, a clinical condition called PWD. PWD is mainly caused by pathogenic bacteria and viruses including diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, coronaviruses [transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)] and rotaviruses; however, diarrheagenic E. coli have a central role in the etiology of PWD (Hampson, 1994) . PWD causes weight loss, slow growth and acute death in recently weaned pigs, resulting in economic losses to swine producers in the US and other countries (Haesebrouck et al., 2004; Nagy and Fekete, 1999; Verdonck et al., 2002; Vu-Khac et al., 2007) . Diarrhea is also a main reason for using antibiotics on swine farms. Antibiotic exposure is linked to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), casting a major concern for animal and human health (Docic and Bilkei, 2003; Mishra et al., 2012; Torjesen, 2016) . However, a ban on the use of food animal growth promoting antibiotics in Scandinavia and Europe spiked PWD outbreaks (Casewell et al., 2003) , urgently calling for alternative effective prevention strategies against PWD. Vaccination would be the most economical and likely effective approach to control PWD and an effective means to reduce the use of antibiotics.
