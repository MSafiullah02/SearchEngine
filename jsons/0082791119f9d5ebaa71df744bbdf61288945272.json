This will likely have a very significant impact on the timely dissemination of scientific results especially in Interactive Computer Graphics and Visual Computing where International Conferences have long been the dissemination mechanism of choice. While our Journal has also been affected by these changes, we are working with many top venues to help in pro-1 http://www.replicabilitystamp.org/ (Accessed May 5th, 2020) 2 https://www.journals.elsevier.com/software-impacts/ (Accessed May 5th, 2020) viding both quality control and speedy publication via Special and Technical Sections as well as inviting authors of accepted papers to present their findings to selected conferences.

They automatically extract wayfinding decision points from raw 3D building geometry to estimate the wayfinding complexity of an environment [5] . Their approach to signage design is done in a twostep optimization. A validation using agent-based-simulation and validated using expert-based VR walk-through, showed increased coverage area with fewer signs than conventional approaches.",

A novel approach by Bruno Roy, Eric Paquette, and Pierre Poulin [7] , proposes particle upsampling as a fast and flexible post-processing approach to increase details in animations of splashing liquids. Their method computes a splash zone using the intersections between a selected volume and colliding objects. Their method can thus generate localized and parameterizable high-resolution splashes from either solid-liquid or liquid-liquid interactions, to produce customizable splashes as details on top of coarsely animated liquids.",

This provides interesting challenges and opportunities to apply crowd simulation as a means to analyze architectural designs for both feasibility and safety. Still, such simulations can be time-and labor-intensive, by requiring experts to tune parameters, adjust designs until reaching acceptable solutions. To obviate this, Kaidong Hu et al. [8] adopt a machine learning approach to learn relationships between crowd motion and building environments. They then apply optimization techniques to identify optimal environment layouts while considering crowd movement features, without needing to run crowd simulations.

A twitter feed 5 is another outlet that is experiencing a significant increase in following. In addition to these, we manage an Instagram page 6 and a YouTube 7 channel to boost the visibility of quality work as it appears on ScienceDirect. Authors are welcome to submit their handles on social media to help us better disseminate their work. In the first quarter of 2020, our new publications have been seen by more than 910 0 0 people. These initiatives are due in no small part to the work of In\u00eas Santos, whose enthusiasm, consistency and dedication are key to establishing and maintaining our media presence.",
