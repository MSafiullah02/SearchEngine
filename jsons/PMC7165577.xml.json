Viruses within one genus are phylogenetically related, have common features in genomic organization, and high degrees of sequence similarities in the RNA polymerase and capsid regions (Guo et al., 1999). Animal caliciviruses are often associated with systemic diseases and gastroenteritis in cats and chickens. Vesicular lesions, reproductive failure in swine and marine animals, and haemorrhagic diseases in rabbit have also been reported. In children, the leading cause of epidemic, non\u2010bacterial gastroenteritis is associated with human caliciviruses (HuCV) (Murphy et al., 1999).",

Porcine enteric calicivirus (PECV) was first reported in the USA and later also found in the UK, Hungary, Japan and Korea (Saif et al., 1980; Nagy et al., 1996; Sugieda et al., 1998; Park et al., 2000). Sequence analysis revealed similarities between the PECV found in the USA and SVs from the UK, while NVs, detected from four caecal contents of pigs in Japan, were closely related to HuCV. The latter finding has raised public health concerns regarding the potential of cross\u2010species transmission, and swine as a possible host for HuCV (Sugieda et al., 1998). Moreover, reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) has also detected enteric caliciviruses in foods, water, sewage and fomites. Thus HuCV has been suggested as the leading cause of food and waterborne viral gastroenteritis in humans (Mead et al., 1999; Schaub and Oshiro, 2000). RT\u2010PCR amplification of PECV RNA from stool specimens has been described. However, there are no reports of diagnosing PECV in Korea (Guo et al., 2001). This is the first report of the molecular epidemiology of PECV outbreaks in Korea, which covers a 2\u2010year period (2001\u20132002).",

They possess a single\u2010stranded, plus\u2010sense genomic RNA, which is 7.4\u20137.7 kb in size and encodes a single structural capsid protein of 58\u201380 kDa. The capsid protein is a polyprotein that contains motifs indicative of a putative 2C helicase, 3C\u2010like protease, RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase 3D (RDRP), and a small basic protein of unknown function (Guo et al., 1999). The RDRP protein of PECV is conserved among calicivirus strains (Guo et al., 1999). As in SVs, the PECV capsid proteins are divided into three distinguished regions. The N\u2010terminal region 1 (aa 1711\u20131984 for PECV) is highly conserved and shows higher amino acid sequence identities with those of SVs than with those of other caliciviruses. Region 2 (aa 1985\u20132132 for PECV) is hypervariable, and corresponds to regions C\u2013E in feline calicivirus and to SMSV1 and SMSV4 (Neill, 1992; Liu et al., 1995; Guo et al., 1999). The C\u2010terminal region 3 is conserved but to a lesser extent than region 1. The capsid diversity among caliciviruses of the same genogroup or genus is mainly determined by the variability within region 2. This region may contain the multiple serotype\u2010specific determinants recognized by monoclonal antibodies (Hardy et al., 1996). Region 3 has conserved amino acid residues and a few antigenic epitopes but shows some variability (Hardy and Estes, 1996; Guo et al., 1999).",

Primers of nested\u2010PCR for the RDRP region were designed according to the published sequence of the RNA polymerase region of the Cowden strain. The sequence of these primers is as follows: primer nR (5\u2032\u2010GAGTGTCTGTTGGCTCAATG\u20103\u2032, 4771\u20134752); primer nF (5\u2032\u2010CTCCTATGCTGAGGACACAC\u20103\u2032, 4392\u20134411). To find out the variability of the region 2 of the capsid region, the oligonucleotide primers used in the RT\u2010PCR and nested\u2010PCR were designed from the published sequence of the capsid region of the Cowden strain.

RNA was serially diluted 10\u2010fold in RNase\u2010free water. PECV RNA was extracted from raw faecal samples by using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with the following modifications to increase the yield of viral RNA. The extraction of single\u2010stranded RNA was repeated twice with TRI, and combined aqueous phases from the first and second extractions. One\u2010step RT\u2010PCR assay was performed with modifications as described previously (Guo et al., 2001). As a negative control, one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR and nested PCR were also performed with the extract of viral nucleic acid from Korean Field Isolate (KPEDV\u20109) of PEDV, and Miller strain of TGEV, cultured on vero and swine testicular cells (provided by Choong Ang Animal Disease Laboratory Ltd, Seoul, Korea) respectively. To increase the sensitivity and specificity of the RT\u2010PCR, 5 \u03bcl of diluted RT\u2010PCR products (1 : 100) were added to a tube containing 45 \u03bcl of the PCR mixture (final dilution 1 : 1000).

Due to this finding, Korean PECVs are classified into two groups when compared with the TC PECV and WT PECV regarding differences in the hypervariable capsid region. The nucleotide and amino acid changes between Korean PECV and that of the Cowden PECV may reflect Korea's different environmental condition, including climate and growing systems. The amplicons shared only limited amino acid sequence identities with a part of the capsid region of vesiviruses (20.5\u201321.6%), lagoviruses (15.8\u201323.4%) and NVs (18.0\u201324.9%). Moreover, these amplicons shared low amino acid identities with those of SVs (22.1\u201323.9%) (Fig. 1). The reduced virulence could probably be due to the result of a potential change in tissue tropism or binding that may be related to the amino acid substitutions in the hypervariable capsid region. Thus, the amino acid changes in the capsid hypervariable region may be associated with both the cell culture adaptation and the attenuation of the virulence of the TC PECV in piglets.",
