Feces were collected by inserting standard cotton tipped swabs into the rectum prior to infection and at 1 week intervals for at least 2 months, and then at 1\u20132 month intervals thereafter. RNA was isolated from the swabs (van der Hoek et al 1995). Five microliters of the purified RNA was added to 7 \u03bcl of PCR mixture containing 6 \u03bcl of TaqMan One Step RT-Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 0.31 \u03bcl of MuLV/RNase Inhibitor, 0.24 \u03bcl each of forward and reverse primers, and 0.10 \u03bcl of RNase-free water. The 12-\u03bcl reaction went through a reverse transcriptase step for 30 min at 48\u00b0C and AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) activation for 10 min at 95\u00b0C. The samples were put through 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 60 s for RNA amplification. PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 7300 Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) System and 7300 System Software. The positive/negative cutoff of the assay was around 75\u2013100 RNA transcripts/swab. Therefore, swabs that were negative at 1 \u00d7 log 10 were considered negative. The number of RNA transcripts per swab was considered equal to the number of viral particle (Gut et al 1999), given that each FECV particle contains only one RNA transcript. There was no evidence for fecal inhibitors of the RT-PCR assay used in this study; SPF cat fecal samples were always negative, but became rapidly and progressively positive after experimental infection. Therefore, internal DNA (Monteiro et al 1997) or RNA (Escobar-Herrera et al 2006) fragment controls were not employed.",

There was a distinct primary stage of infection that lasted from 7 to 18 months; the highest level of virus shedding occurred during this stage. This primary stage was resolved in one of three manners: (1) recovery, (2) persistent shedding, and (3) recurrent or intermittent shedding. These findings corroborated earlier studies of naturally occurring FECV infection. In a comprehensive study of 275 purebred cats from six catteries, fecal samples were collected every 1\u20133 months for a year and virus shedding quantified by RT-PCR (Foley et al 1997b). A large proportion of these cattery cats shed virus at any given time, but most manifested cycles of infection and shedding. Similarly, Harpold et al (1999) found that all adult cats in an Abyssinian cattery shed virus in their feces at least once during the year and 4/15 cats were shedding greater than 75% of the time. Rohner (1999) reported that FECV shedding dramatically decreased over 2 years in a group of naturally infected cats. Herrewegh et al (1997) studied the persistence and evolution of endemic FECV infection in a closed cat-breeding facility. Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in the feces and/or plasma of 36 of 42 cats (86%) tested. Four of five infected cats were still shedding when tested 111 days later. Two cats were then placed in strict isolation and virus shedding was found to last up to 7 months in one animal.",

However, an immunologic explanation for the recurrent pattern of shedding was not so apparent. It would be tempting to blame periods of recurrent shedding on frequent reinfections. Reinfection is a common occurrence for many gut pathogens, because local immunity often requires persistence of the organism and does not possess strong memory (Brandtzaeg 2007). However, successful reinfection in four cats resembled a primary infection in magnitude and duration, which was not true for recurrent bouts of shedding. It is possible that recurrent shedding was an artifact of the assay procedure. If the assay failed to delineate low level shedding from non-shedding, recurrent and persistent shedders would be basically the same accept for amplitude. The alternative possibility was that these periods of reshedding were due to reactivation of a latent or sub-detectable infection. However, this was not supported by studies of natural or artificial stress (see below).",

Rohner (1999) also found that the levels of FECV were many log10 higher during early than late infection. Foley et al (1997b) were the first to show higher levels of FECV shedding in kittens than older cats in shelters. These findings have an important collective implication for FIP. FIP is much more common among younger cats (Pedersen, 1976, Foley et al., 1997a). If kittens are infected before their immune systems are fully matured, levels of FECV replication would be higher, and greater levels of virus replication would favor FECV \u2192 FIPV mutations. Relative age-related immunodeficiency could also prevent kittens from containing the FIP mutant virus. This scenario is supported by research with FECV-RM infection in cats that were immunocompromised by long-standing FIV infection (Poland et al 1996). Chronic FIV infected cats shed 10\u2013100 times more FECV than age-matched non-FIV infected cats, just like FECV in kittens, and 2/19 of them developed FIP vs none of the 20 FIV free cohorts. It was concluded that immunosuppression caused by chronic FIV infection enhanced the creation and selection of FIPV mutants by increasing the rate of FECV replication in the bowel, as well as by inhibiting the host's ability to combat the mutant viruses once they occurred.",

None of these kittens shed virus prior to 9 weeks of age, while all kittens that were tested between 10 and 15 weeks were positive. These findings were in concordance with those of Foley et al., 1997a, Foley et al., 1997b, who were not able to detect virus in feces before 10 weeks of age in cattery kittens. However, Harpold et al (1999) found that kittens in an Abyssinian cattery started shedding virus at 33\u201378 days (5\u201311 weeks) of age (mean 9.6 weeks). Gut et al (1999) studied 77 kittens from 12 catteries and found a progressive rise in fecal shedding from around 2\u20134 weeks onwards, with a peak at 9 weeks of age. Therefore, the period of 9 weeks of age is probably when most kittens are infected, although it may occur at an earlier age under certain conditions. These chronological findings support FCoV control programs that advocate isolation of pregnant queens and early weaning of their kittens (Addie et al 2004). Theoretically, if queens are strictly isolated and their kittens separated at the earliest possible time (<5\u20136 weeks of age), the kittens will remain, for the most part, free of FECV. The problem with this procedure is the occasional infection of kittens at 2\u20135 weeks of age (Gut, 1999, Harpold et al., 1999) as well as the problem of preventing infection after weaning. FECV is easily transmitted from room to room by caregivers even with very good containment facilities and procedures (Pedersen et al 1981a). The ease of fomite transmission and ubiquitous nature of the virus makes it extremely difficult to keep cats free of the virus. However, delaying FECV infection until the kittens are older (>16 weeks), by isolation and early weaning, may have another depressing effect on FIP regardless of whether or not they are infected later in life. The levels of virus replication might be lower in older kittens, thus decreasing the likelihood of mutants, and the immune system would be more competent in containing any FIPV that might arise.",

The stress of parturition and lactation is known to activate latent feline herpesvirus infection in about 40% of queens, and this re-excretion of virus is an important route for infection of kittens (Gaskell and Povey 1977). This stress can be mimicked by the administration of corticosteroids (Gaskell and Povey, 1977, Hickman et al., 1994); a single dose of methylprednisolone acetate is particularly effective (Reubel et al 1993). Methylprednisolone is also a potent activator of latent feline leukemia virus infection (Rojko et al., 1982, Pedersen et al., 1984a, Pedersen et al., 1984b) and will abolish age-related resistance to FeLV (Pedersen and Johnson 1991). It will even reactivate subclinical dermatophyte infections in kittens in the post-recovery phase (Pedersen 1991). Unlike feline herpesvirus, neither parturition/lactation nor methylprednisolone treatment affected FECV shedding in this laboratory setting. It might be argued that conditions in nature are more severe; however, FECV shedding was also not affected by parturition and lactation in cattery cats (Foley et al 1997b).",

When fecal shedders and non-shedders are looked at as groups, the relationship between higher titers and shedding and lower titers and non-shedding was significant. However, the overlap between titer and shedding was substantial and greatly diminished the value of titers in evaluating shedding status in individual cats. The value of applying group FECV.",

            "text": "Application of this technique to eradication of FECV under experimental conditions was first reported by Hickman et al (1995). A FECV was inadvertently introduced into a very large research cat-breeding colony and not recognized until a few cases of FIP were confirmed over the next couple of years. In order to save valuable blood lines, FECV was eradicated based on serum antibody titers. Cats with high or rising titers were culled and cats with low and decreasing titers were taken out of breeding and maintained in strict isolation. The process of continually selecting cats with low titers eventually yielded a much smaller group of cats that were proven to be free of FECV by following titers in their kittens. If the titers in kittens were strictly of maternal origin, they would become negative by 12\u201316 weeks. If the kittens were infected, they would fall, and then rise again after 12\u201316 weeks. Such an eradication regimen requires exceptional quarantine facilities and infection control practices and accurate titer determinations. These are difficult to achieve in most multi-cat environments in the field. Although the use of group titers for eradication may not be useful to many multi-cat households and catteries, group titers may be helpful in looking at the overall coronavirus status in cattery or other multi-cat environments. Groups of cats that tend to have high titers are likely to have a significant proportion of FECV shedders, while the converse would be true for groups of cats that have low and negative titers. Catteries with many high titer cats are known to have a greater incidence of FIP (Foley et al., 1997a, Foley et al., 1997b).",

First, there is a definite primary stage of infection that lasts several months, followed by a period when virus shedding either remains persistent at a lower level, becomes intermittent, or ceases. The immunity generated during this primary stage was slow to develop, variable in strength, and tenuous in duration. Reinfection also appeared to mirror primary infection, indicating that immunity is not only tenuous, but that it lacks memory. The finding that immunity is tenuous and reinfection common mirrors the conclusions of Addie et al (2003), who found that FECV recovered cats can be reinfected with the same or different strains of the virus. This is characteristic of gut immunity in general (Brandtzaeg 2007) and to coronavirus immunity in particular (Saif 2004). This pattern of infection and immunity is strongly influenced by environmental factors. FECV infection would be self-limiting if groups of cats were allowed to grow old without constant re-exposure to other infected cats and to new cats (especially kittens). Certain husbandry practices unique to cats may also favor cat-to-cat (ie, litterboxes and litter) and cat-to-human-to-cat (fomite) transmission.",
