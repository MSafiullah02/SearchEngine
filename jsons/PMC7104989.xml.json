These bacteria are extracted by Kupffer cells, killed by neutrophils, or excreted in bile in healthy clinical states. A low-flow, low-pressure perfusion of hepatic sinusoids may allow superior removal of bacteria by phagocytes, and pressure differentials in the biliary system may limit retrograde access of enteric organisms.2, 4, 5 Changes in this sinusoidal flow may decrease the effectiveness of phagocytosis when portal flow is compromised. Bowel disease, cholestasis, immunosuppression, and altered gut motility result in altered portal circulation, and the subsequently unchecked bacterial access to the liver may result in bacterial hepatitis or cholangiohepatitis. Common isolates implicated in bacterial hepatitis and cholecystitis include Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp, Bacteroides spp, Streptococcus spp, and Clostridium spp.6 Cultures can be obtained by liver aspirate, liver biopsy, and cholecystocentesis. A combination of liver and gall bladder samples (Fig 1) may increase the likelihood of identification of the offending organism(s). Surgical or laparoscopic biopsies may be more rewarding for culture growth compared with aspirates.6 In suspected cases, broad-spectrum antibiotics for common enteric isolates should be initiated pending specific culture results.",

            "text": "Leptopirosis is an extremely common nonenteric bacterial infection in the canine liver. Leptospires are thin, filamentous, spiral-shaped motile bacteria with a lipopolysaccharide outer envelope. Direct transmission occurs via contact with infected urine, venereal and placental tissues, or fluids. Indirect transmission can occur through contaminated water sources, soil, food, or bedding. The organism can stay stable for several months with the right environmental conditions. The organism initially penetrates the mucous membranes and rapidly multiplies after entry into the vascular space. Dissemination and replication occur in many tissues, including the liver. However, the organism tends to persist in the kidney and can be shed for weeks to months after infection. Certain serovars are more frequently associated with hepatic involvement and include Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae and L. pomona. Young dogs (<6 months of age) seem to develop signs of hepatic dysfunction more frequently in disease outbreaks.14 Profound hepatic dysfunction may occur without significant histologic changes because of subcellular damage produced by bacterial toxins. The endothelial damage, subsequent thrombosis, and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation seen in acute disease may contribute to hepatic damage. Chronic hepatitis has been reported as a sequelae to leptospiral infection.15, 16 Diagnosis is usually made based on clinical signs and serologic titers. However, leptospirosis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed before treatment may increase testing sensitivity given vaccinal interference and delayed seroconversion in the acute phase.17 Penicillins are the treatment of choice in the acute phase and must be followed by appropriate antibiotics to eliminate the carrier state. Alternatively, doxycycline may be used for both the acute and carrier states.",

Transmission generally occurs through ingestion or penetration of injured skin or mucosa. Disease can develop with diminished host resistance or concurrent diseases.68 Concomitant large intestinal diarrhea and ocular signs should prompt clinical consideration of Prototheca infection. Dissemination via blood or lymph to other organs including the liver is common. Various stages of development of the organism may be identified on cytology or histopathology. Urine culture and sediment are also useful in organism identification.69 This disease is invariably fatal, although disease progression may be delayed with various antifungal and antibacterial agents.70, 71, 72, 73\n",

Sporozoites are released in the intestine on tick ingestion and penetrate the gut wall, invade mononuclear cells, and disseminate. Target organs include the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes but can involve other internal organs such as the liver, kidney, and lungs.88, 89 The most striking clinicopathologic abnormality is leukocytosis with evidence of parasitemia of the white cells on peripheral blood smears. Clinical findings can range from incidental hematologic findings to severe life-threatening illness. Hepatitis, glomerulonephritis, and pneumonitis have all resulted from H. canis infection.90 Coinfections with other protozoal diseases (Toxoplasma, Leishmania, and Babesia spp) or other tick-borne diseases (Ehrlichia spp) and immunosuppressive states can predispose animals to clinical illness. The hepatitis is associated with developing meronts within the liver and their associated neutrophilic and mononuclear inflammation. Hepatozoon has also been documented in felines.91, 92, 93 Microscopic detection of gamonts in peripheral blood smears is the most frequently used diagnostic test.

Waxing and waning clinical signs are attributed to repeated cycles of asexual reproduction and pyogranulomatous inflammation. The primary site of infection for the merozoites is the cardiac and skeletal muscle. However, single zoites can enter circulation and reproduce asexually at distant locations.95 Diagnosis is most often made with muscle biopsy, although a recent study has identified promise in the use of PCR testing.96 An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been developed with sporozoites as the antigen.97 No treatment effectively eliminates the tissue stages of H. americanum.

The bobcat is the natural reservoir in North America and is usually asymptomatic despite persistent erythroparasitemia. The tissue phase of infection consists of the development of large schizonts in mononuclear phagocytes. The schizonts line the lumens of vessels in most organs, eventually leading to vessel occlusion. Merozoites are released into blood or tissue fluid once the host cells rupture and infect red blood cells. Late-stage parasitemia can often be detected on blood films at about 1 to 3 days before death. Most clinical signs, including those associated with liver abnormalities, are due to schizont-associated mechanical obstruction. However, parasite by-products may also be toxic, pyogenic, and vasoactive. The anemia is regenerative but mild in comparison with clinical icterus. This may be useful in differentiating this infection from hemotropic mycoplasmas. Demonstration of piroplasms in Wright's-stained or Giemsa-stained blood films most frequently provides a definitive diagnosis. Histopathology reveals schizont-laden mononuclear phagocytes in the veins of the lungs, liver, and spleen. The prognosis is generally considered poor, but different geographic strains may have varying virulence.101 Treatment with diminazene or imidocarb has been somewhat successful.102\n",

Domestic cats are the definitive hosts and excrete the infective oocyts. Three stages of the life cycle are considered infectious, including oocyst sporozoites, tissue cyst tachyzoites, and tissue cyst bradyzoites. Transmission can occur through ingestion of oocysts or tissue cysts and via congenital transmission. Other reported modes include lactation, transfusions, and transplantation.103 A higher frequency of disease is reported in dogs and cats fed raw meat or those in a rural/feral environment. The extra-intestinal life cycle is the same in all hosts, and sporozoites encyst in the intestinal lumen, penetrate cells, and divide into tachyzoites. The tachyzoites can form cysts in the CNS, muscle, and visceral organs, and may persist for the life of the host. Clinical signs were diverse in 100 cats with histologically confirmed toxoplasmosis, and more than 90% had pulmonary, CNS, and liver manifestations.104, 105 In dogs, disseminated infection is most often associated with canine distemper, other infections including ehrlichiosis and immunosuppression, or vaccination with live attenuated vaccines.106 Clinical cases in cats have been seen with steroids, cyclosporine use, hemotropic mycoplasms, and viral disease.107, 108, 109 Liver and lung involvement is associated with quicker mortality than other organ involvement. Tachyzoites may be detected on cytology of various organs and body fluids. However, diagnosis is most frequently based on clinical signs, serology (immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M), and response to treatment. Clindamycin is the treatment of choice.",

Clinical cases involve adult indoor or indoor-outdoor cats. The severity of clinical signs is proportional to the number of adult flukes as well as to the duration of parasitemia. Early diagnosis can be difficult. However, diagnosis is easier when eggs have been identified in the bile.128 Treatment of P. concinnum and liver fluke infections is best accomplished with praziquantel.",
