            "text": ", we have recognized the unprecedented nature of this era and the truly extraordinary nature of clinical scenarios that our colleagues are facing. Questions surrounding potential rationing of care and moral distress have been omnipresent and serve as a point of anxiety going forward. To this end, the Department of Surgery has relied upon its longstanding culture of integrating the institution's center for clinical medical ethics with a bi-weekly, open invitation ethics forum via videoconferencing. This has functioned as an outlet for individual clinicians and residents to engage with our medical ethics faculty, discuss practical issues, as well as address theoretic concerns that may arise. Discussion topics have included strategies for mitigating moral distress and future moral injury, rationing of care, an inside look at the Italian COVID experience, and muzzling of concerns from health care workers.",
