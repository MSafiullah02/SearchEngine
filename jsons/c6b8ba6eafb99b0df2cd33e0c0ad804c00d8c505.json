Still, an affordable and reliable procedure to effectively screen the potentially infected patients is much needed. The reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is the preliminary evaluation to assess whether a subject is at risk of COVID-19. However, the less satisfactory sensitivity of RT-PCR has its limitation on reducing the false-negative rate [1] and may overlook a good number of COVID-19 patients, especially in their early stage of infection. It is essential to find a complementary testing to boost the screening confidence and chest radiology, especially chest x-ray (CXR), with the advantages of affordability, efficiency and reliability, is promising in this regard. As will be demonstrated in the experiments, the proposed AI-based CXR screening system of COVID-19 could effectively detect the infection with high sensitivity, even several days prior to the confirmed RT-PCR results.",

The supporting evidence is threefold. First, performing CT scanning for comprehensive screening is not practical to contain a pandemic outbreak in that even the well-established healthcare system of a developed country simply does not have such a capacity to do so. Second, cleaning the CT scanning equipment takes considerably longer time than the case of using chest x-ray. The deep cleaning is necessary to prevent subsequent patients from being infected of COVID-19. Third, chest x-rays are already widely adopted as a de facto screening procedure, while CT scanning equipment is not equally popular and is mostly available in primary healthcare institutes. Their distinction in public use also reflects in the availability of large-scale open datasets of chest x-ray images over CT. The ease of collecting image data is crucial in training a reliable AI-based screening system, especially under the current circumstance.",

To extend the model, we collaborate with several medical research centers in Taiwan to collect chest x-ray images from COVID-19 patients at various stages, and re-train the pneumonia classification system using a three-stage cascaded learning strategy. Specifically, in the first stage, the AI model is trained to predict from a given CXR image the regions of interest, i.e., the mask of lung regions. In the second stage, features from the predicted regions are extracted to decide whether the image is a positive case of pneumonia. In the final and the third stage, the platform would further make decision on whether the underlying case is COVID-19 or another type of pneumonia. The resulting screening system also yields the stage-wise predicted heatmaps and thus provides explainable image clues leading to the classifications. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed platform for COVID-19 screening, we report the inference results from both the open datasets and those from the collected clinical cases.",

The training set can be further decomposed as D = D o \u222a D c and |D o | |D c | to indicate that D o is the original (large) collection for conventional pneumonia classification and D c includes all the COVID-19 CXR images. The overall network architecture of the proposed three-stage cascaded learning is illustrated in Fig. 1 . We detail the design details as follows. To prevent an AI-based system from learning inconsistent information or noisy annotations, we design the pneumonia classification system to focus on the essential regions of interest, which in our case is the lung areas. We consider a U-Net model [2] to first predict a mask of the lung regions in a CXR image, and use the resulting mask to filter out image areas that could distract the AI system from learning the crucial pneumonia-relevant features for the underlying classification problem. Simply put, the task of the first stage, as shown in Fig. 2(C) , can be thought of as a preprocessing step to segment the mask of the lung regions in each given CXR image.",

The preprocessing stage 1, lung segmentation, is trained on Tuberculosis Chest X-ray Image Data Sets that consist of two parts, Montgomery County X-ray Set and Shenzhen Hospital X-ray Set. The total number of samples contains 406 normal case images and 394 tuberculosis case images. We randomly sample 80% as our training/validation sets and 20% as our test set. Our stage 1 model achieves 0.88 dice similarity coefficient (DSC) on the test set. Fig. 3 shows some segmentation outcomes from our stage 1 model. We further investigate the effect of stage 1 considering the whole screening pipeline. Table 3 compares the pneumonia classification (stage 2) results between models with lung segmentation masking and models without lung segmentation masking. Table 1 . We separate the data into three groups: Noraml (N), Pneumonia (P, non-COVID-19), and COVID-19 (C). Normal and non-COVID-19 pneumonia CXR images are collected from Padchest [7] and RSNA [8] , while COVID-19 samples are selected from [6] . For the data from Padchest and RSNA, we randomly divide it into training/validation/testing in the ratio of 80%/10%/10%. As to the data of COVID-19, we split it into training/validation/testing in the ratio of 50%/25%/25%, due to its small sample size. During stage 2, binary labels are considered, where non-COVID-19 Pneumonia (P) and COVID-19 (C) samples are labeled as 1 (positive) and Normal samples are labeled as 0 (negative). For each batch of training, we evenly sample each group to account for imbalanced distributions among Normal, non-COVID-19 Pneumonia, and COVID-19 samples. The masked images by stage 1 model (lung segmentation, as in Fig. 3 ) are used as the input of stage 2 model for both training and inference. After achieving results of pneumonia classification of stage 2 as in Table 4 , we then train the stage 3 model to distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia, using only non-COVID-19 Pneumonia (P) and COVID-19 (C) training samples. All parameters but those of stage 3 are fixed during training. In this stage, marked as \"3: COVID-19\" in Table 4 , COVID-19 (C) samples are labeled as 1 (positive) while non-COVID-19 Pneumonia (P) samples are labeled as 0 (negative). Table 4 shows Fine-tune stage 2 and 3 on clinical datasets (NTUH and TMUH). From Table 4 , we observe the performance gaps in both validation and testing between clinical data and open data. (We will further elaborate this discovery in the next section.) To further improve the AI-based classification performance and achieve clinical applicability, we collaborate with NTUH, TMUH, and NHIA to collect more clinical COVID-19 CXR samples, as summarized in Table 2 . Starting from a pre-trained model using only open datasets, we fine-tune our model using clinical data. Instead of using only clinical data, we combine open datasets and clinical datasets to prevent from overfitting during our fine-tuning phase, and consider the incremental learning strategy as in (2) . As in the experiments on open datasets, we fine-tune our pneumonia classification (stage 2) and COVID-19 screening (stage 3) sequentially. Based on the final results shown in Table 5 , our method is able to recognize Normal, Pneumonia (both non-COVID-19 and COVID-19), non-COVID-19, and COVID-19 cases respectively with high AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. For qualitative result, those cases sampled from the testing set of open dataset in Fig. 6 and the clinical dataset in Fig. 5 demonstrate reasonable model activation in different stages. Fine-tune stage 3 on NHIA dataset. To evaluate the clinical applicability of our method, we fine-tune our stage 3 model on a relatively larger dataset (NHIA), which includes 306 COVID-19 (C) samples from 306 confirmed cases in Taiwan and 3,069 non-COVID-19 Pneumonia (P) samples. Of those 3,069 Pneumonia (P) samples, 50% of them are diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia and the other half are diagnosed with viral pneumonia. Table 6 includes the validation and testing results on NHIA dataset, suggesting the potential of using our method for distinguishing COVID-19 from both common bacterial and viral pneumonia.",

Suggested by medical experts, because of the efficiency and availability of CXR, we propose an AI-based screening system to recognize COVID-19 pneumonia in CXR images. Regarding coarse to fine manners, our cascaded method consists of lung segmentation, pneumonia recognition, and COVID-19 recognition as hierarchical screening. The proposed approach outperforms a previous method on open dataset of COVID-19 cases and is able to reach clinical-grade performance on NTUH and TMUH clinical data. Moreover, our method has been integrated into the internal system of Taiwan NHIA and CDC, achieving over 80% sensitivity and specificity on NHIA clinical test cases. Key future research challenges include the sensitivity improvement on cases with mild symptoms, medical studies of COVID-19 cases with recognized lesion patterns, and the refinement of lung segmentation to uncover subtle and relevant regions.

The convenience of working with an open dataset often comes with a price-the image quality could vary among samples in the collection and noisy or irrelevant annotations may be included in some images. Figures 2(A) and 2(B) illustrate examples of such issues regarding the image or annotation quality from an open dataset of medical images. (A) Misleading model attentions (right column) caused by non-informative areas (left column). (B) Four examples of \"noisy\" CXR images from open datasets. The alphabet at the upper-right corner, date stamp, and arrow marks in CXR images may confuse an AI-based system in both training and inference.
