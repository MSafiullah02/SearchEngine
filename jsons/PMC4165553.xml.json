            "text": "Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary from year to year, and it is important to continually monitor VE to confirm that vaccination is providing adequate protection and to identify factors affecting VE. The test negative design is an approach to estimating influenza VE from observational data based on recruitment of cases with acute respiratory infection, and comparison of vaccine coverage among the cases testing positive for influenza virus versus coverage among the cases testing negative for influenza virus [6]. The design has some similarities to a case\u2013control study, but one major difference is the absence of a group of patients prospectively identified and recruited specifically as controls in most such studies. An exception is in test-negative studies conducted retrospectively, when laboratory results can be included in the case definition and a separate group of patients with negative laboratory results for influenza can be recruited [7]. Provided that some assumptions are satisfied [8], [9], the design is thought to allow unbiased estimation of VE. The majority of test-negative studies reported in the literature have been conducted in outpatient settings in temperate locations [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. We have conducted systematic surveillance of the hospitalization burden of influenza among children in Hong Kong since 1997 [15], [16], [17], and here we use the test-negative approach to estimate influenza VE in this population. This study provided a better estimate of VE against the more severe outcome of influenza.",

The timeline of recruitment of patients is shown in Fig. 1\n. As previously shown [15], [16], [17], influenza activity and pediatric hospitalization are not limited to the winter peak in Hong Kong. The majority (80.8%) of children were 5 years or younger of age, and there were more males than females although there was no significant gender difference between those who tested positive or negative for influenza (Table 1\n). 9.0% of test-negative patients reported receipt of influenza vaccination in the preceding 6 months, compared to 4.8% of the patients that tested positive for influenza A or B virus (p\n < 0.001). Among patients between 6 months and 2 years of age, 6.9% reported receipt of influenza vaccination in the preceding 6 months, compared to 12.3% among children 3\u20135 years and 10.8% among children 6\u201317 years. Parents were unable to recall the exact dates of vaccination but the history of vaccination given showed that children received TIV well into January. This appears to be a common practice in Hong Kong that is different from places like the US where the main annual influenza vaccination happens over a couple of months in October and November in the fall.",

The overall VE was 61.7% (95% confidence interval, CI: 43.0%, 74.2%) against influenza A and B combined, based on reported receipt of seasonal influenza vaccination in the preceding 6 months comparing test-positive to test-negative patients (Table 2\n).

Studies from several countries also showed low to moderate VE for the 2011\u20132012 season for H3N2 in adults and children when there was also antigenic mismatch with the vaccine [13], [14], [30], [31]. However, the circulating H3N2 strain in 2012\u20132013 in Hong Kong was matched to the vaccine while VE was still poor. One possible explanation was that the epidemic in 2012\u20132013 was very late, peaking in September (Fig. 1) and therefore VE may have been low due to waning post-vaccination immunity [11], [31]. A study from the UK showed that the VE for H3N2 in 2011/12 showed waning intra-seasonal protection [32]. VE was moderate in the first three months of the season but reduced in the second three months even when there was antigenic match. We only captured vaccination history within 6 months but did not have information on vaccination within 3 months, while influenza vaccines are typically administered between October and January prior to the winter influenza season in Hong Kong. The H3N2 epidemics in this 4-year study were in the summer and fall and largely mismatched with the vaccine strains. Our finding of VE against H3N2 may not be generalized.",

This was surprisingly good considering the circulating influenza B lineages of Victoria:Yamagata was at a 4:6 ratio in the largest influenza B epidemic in this study in 2012, with the TIV including a Victoria lineage virus. Specifically, the VE against influenza B in 2012 in a 60% mismatch season was 65.8% (95% CI: 16.8%, 85.9%). The VE seen appears to be higher than that of 38% (95% CI: 4, 60) for a poor match season according to a meta-analysis of controlled trials of TIV in children and non-elderly adults [33]. Other studies have also shown suboptimal VE in the situation of a mismatch season [34], [35]. One explanation of the difference seen between ours and the previous studies may be that since the prevalence of cross-protective antibody is a function of previous priming by antigenically related strains or subtypes, children in Hong Kong with high influenza activity are more likely to have been primed by both influenza B lineages. A study from Canada showed an adjusted VE of 55% (95% CI: 32%, 70%) against a mismatched influenza B for 2007\u20132008 in adults and children which also demonstrated some cross-protection [36]. The quadrivalent influenza vaccine that contains both B lineages has been licensed and recommended for use in the US for the 2013\u20132014 season [18]. A multinational VE study of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine against \u2018moderate-to-severe\u2019 PCR-confirmed influenza was recently published [37]. Surprisingly, the VE against moderate to severe influenza B disease, defined as a body temperature higher than 39 \u00b0C, otitis media, lower respiratory tract illness, or myositis, encephalitis, seizure or myocarditis, was only 46.5 (95% CI: 34.1, 78.7) in a season with almost exclusively the Victoria lineage. Further vaccine effectiveness studies comparing the quadrivalent and trivalent vaccines will have to be conducted to determine whether the theoretical advantage of inclusion of strains from both B lineages could be translated to a real improvement in VE.",

Unlike most influenza VE studies, our study was conducted year round. This allowed us to capture all influenza hospitalization. This is particularly relevant for areas with prolonged or multiple influenza A seasons, as well as for influenza B epidemics that can occur any time of the year. Another strength of our study includes matching test-positive patients with test-negative patients recruited in the same week which may be particularly important when influenza activity is not concentrated in a few weeks. Furthermore, we have shown that our results are robust even when using different criteria to define the \u201ctest negative\u201d group (Table 2), viz. influenza negative, negative for all viruses tested or those positive for other viruses.",

To culture respiratory viruses, it is able to isolate more respiratory viruses but lack of sensitivity to certain viruses such as human metapneumovirus [compared to RT-PCR for HMPV, sensitivity of culture is 13.6% (unpublished data)], or unable to recover such as rhinovirus type C [41] or unable to isolate human coronaviruses [42].",

A second limitation is that vaccination history in the preceding 6 months was self-reported and there may have been some misclassification bias leading to underestimation or overestimation of VE overall, while as mentioned above we did not collect data on exact date of vaccination. We also did not have information on comorbidity. In addition, our definition of the vaccination status to be those receiving vaccine within 6 months of hospitalization may falsely bias toward higher VE in a setting where the influenza season lasts for many months. Given that it may not be feasible to vaccinate more than once each year, true VE late in the influenza season may be lower than our estimates for children vaccinated in the November\u2013December period as recommended in Hong Kong. Finally, our definition of the vaccination status to be those who had received vaccine within 6 months of hospitalization precluded assessment of VE for the whole year in line with the practice of annual influenza vaccination.",

Vaccine effectiveness varied by year correlating with vaccine match although the impact of a mismatched B lineage is less clear. Protection against hospitalization also appeared to decrease when an epidemic happens late in the year. In our analyses, we chose to match test-positive and test-negative patients by calendar week to allow fairer estimation of VE given changing vaccine coverage during the course of the year. This approach may be particularly valuable in subtropical and tropical settings with prolonged influenza activity.",
