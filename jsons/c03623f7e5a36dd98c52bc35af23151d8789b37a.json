We selected 5 scores in normal distribution of these durations as lagging days, which will be used in the following estimation of death rate. We calculated each death rate on accumulative confirmed cases with each lagging day from the current data and then weighted every death rate with its corresponding possibility to obtain the total death rate on each day. While the trendline of these death rate curves meet the curve of current ratio between accumulative death cases and confirmed cases at some points in the near future, we considered that these intersections are within the range of real death rates.",

Following normal distribution, the mean score \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3 can be calculated either. Thus the 5 selected scores (\u03bc, \u03bc \u00b1 \u03c3 and \u03bc \u00b1 2\u03c3) in normal distribution can be obtain as the basic elements for the following estimation and prediction of death rate, which are respectively 2, 8, 13, 19, 25 days. The disease information in table 2 has been collected from the public media before we resume data analysing with the same method of death rate estimation and prediction in South Korea as in China [1] . We have collected accumulative confirmed cases and deaths and then new confirmed cases and new deaths in South Korea. ",

Based on these results, the total death rate in regions can be calculated specifically by putting in the different death rates with different durations together. While the trendline of these death rate curves meet the curve of current ratio between accumulative death cases and confirmed cases at some points in the near future, we considered that these intersections are within the range of real death rates.

The predicated death numbers then were compared to the real death numbers (Table 6 ). considerably lower than expected. Prior expectation has been much higher, based on multiple infectious routes [3] [4] . Using our formula, the results indicate that the current infectious rate is even lower than the rate based on the total numbers (see Fig. 1A ). The infectious rate in Hubei province is currently around 4%, although previously the rate was as high as 39%. On average, the infectious rate overall in China is about 4%, while in Hubei it is 10%. In the rest of the country, it is 0.46%. Among the inpatients, the rate in serious medical condition ranges from 10% to 30% (see Fig. 1B ), while it averages at 18% in China, 19% in Hubei, and 13% in the rest of country (except Hubei).
