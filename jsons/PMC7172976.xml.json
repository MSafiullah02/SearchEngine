There are 74.0 million children younger than 18 years in the United States in 2020. Every 1% increase in the proportion of the US population infected with SARS-CoV-2 includes an additional 740 000 children who become infected. Even under moderate cumulative infection proportion scenarios, it is projected that there would be millions of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and thousands of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 patients as the epidemic peaks across the nation.",
