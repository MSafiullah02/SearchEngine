SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 had swept the entire of China, including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, in only 1 month. A total of 72 528 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases and 1870 deaths have been reported in China as of 18 February 2020,\n3\n and 25 countries outside China have reported confirmed cases.\n3\n The WHO issued a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020.",

Most patients with COVID\u201019 among the first cluster of pneumonia cases (27 of 41, 65.9%) were exposed to Huanan seafood market,\n2\n and several wild animals, including bats, snakes, minks, and pangolins, were reported to be the possible reservoir for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n Patients are currently the major sources for the COVID\u201019 outbreak given the increasing number of cases. Mild but infectious cases may also serve as sources and make COVID\u201019 difficult to control.\n7\n\n",

Nevertheless, the latest reports argued that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein binds ACE2 with a much higher affinity than SARS\u2010CoV S protein does.\n9\n This may be an important factor contributing to the quick spread of COVID\u201019.",

Several groups have analyzed the clinical features of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients to elucidate what factors considerably influenced disease outcomes.\n1\n, \n2\n Li et al\n2\n showed that, among the 425 patients who were confirmed before 22 January 2020, elderly patients were more likely to suffer severe infections, and no child (<15\u2010years old) were infected. However, age may have little relationship with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, and all individuals have an equal possibility of being infected because of the increasing number of cases.\n1\n The high\u2010risk population are those who have an exposure history, are older, and have underlying diseases, such as hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n1\n\n",

SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is transmitted between humans mainly via aerial droplets and direct contact.\n1\n, \n2\n The virus is also found in stool specimens of patients, suggesting potential fecal\u2010oral transmission pathway; however, this route requires further investigation.\n10\n The Wuhan government has pronounced to shut down public transport system since 23 January 2020 to control virus transmission. All other cities in Hubei Province implemented similar policies in the next 3 days. However, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 transmission seemed to be not effectively controlled. Only 425 cases were reported before 22 January 2020, yet, the confirmed cases have explosively increased since then.\n2\n, \n3\n One possible reason may be that millions of people had left Wuhan for the traditional Spring Festival before the city closed. If any of these people were infected, they would be dangerous sources of the following generations of virus transmission. Community transmission has been ongoing in a number of provinces outside the Hubei Province in China. Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces have all announced a huge number of confirmed cases (more than 900).\n3\n Local transmission chains in these provinces may have started through the index cases imported from Hubei Province. Their richer economic environment (Guangdong and Zhejiang) and proximity to Hubei (Henan, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi) mean frequent population exchanges and, consequently, frequent virus transmission.",

The most important goal is to control infectious sources. The Chinese government rapidly initiated serial measures, such as isolating Wuhan and then the whole Hubei Province, improving epidemic information monitoring and reporting, and detecting, isolating, and curing patients. More than 8000 physicians and nurses from other provinces went to Hubei Province and started to combat the disease with local medical staff.\n7\n At the same time, two hospitals with 2600 beds in total have been built in Wuhan for confirmed and suspected patients.\n7\n A fast and effective detection system was established and maintained to differentiate suspected patients continuously. Rational supervision on wild vectors may also be important but is easily ignored. The second thing we could do is to safeguard susceptible people. The Chinese government has quickly organized supplies and taken measures based on SARS\u2010CoV epidemic control to guarantee the order of daily life. Popular science propaganda was widely implemented to evoke civilians with self\u2010protection and hand hygiene and to reduce going out. Third, authorities need to take measures to cut off the transmission of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 among local residents. For example, the Chinese Spring Festival holidays should be extended and school openings should be postponed. Besides, home quarantine is the best choice for residents, however, the widespread lockdown may inevitably bring a psychological effect; hence, mental health counseling and popularization are recommended. Lastly, we should say that what we have done today is not only to control COVID\u201019 but, more importantly, to build a security system to prevent similar outbreaks in the future.",
