Preliminary data from Chinese studies indicated that COVID-19 was more lethal in the elderly than younger people [13,15], and we also found that an older age was an independent risk factor for death, as in the case of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus [23,24].

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increased severity of COVID-19 in obese patients, including the combination of reduced cardiorespiratory reserve and impairment of adaptive immune response to infections [27] It should be notice that the proportion of obese patients in our cohort was much lower than that recently described in a large case series by Richardson et al (16.3% vs 41.7%) and it cannot be excluded that in countries with high prevalence rate of obesity the effect of this condition on the burden of COVID-19 related mortality may be greater [19].",

It has been shown that in pulmonary diseases marked by inflammatory features there is a typical raise in serum CRP level in response to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1 or TNF-\u03b1. [29]. Thus, higher CRP level in non-survivors of our study may indicate excessive and dangerous inflammatory response. We also found a significant correlation between higher CK levels upon admission and the risk of death. Elevated level of CK in COVID-19 patients might be a sign of respiratory muscle injury resulting from the increased demands placed on the respiratory system. There also previous evidence suggesting that serum levels of CK may rise in patients with pneumonia and pulmonary embolic disease [30]. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that the increase in CK values in COVID-19 may be related to a damage to CK-rich tissues, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle and brain, directly induced by the virus or maladaptive immune responses. Autopsy studies are required to define the damage of organs that can cause CK increase during COVID-9.",

Firstly, as in China, the dramatically evolving scenario of the epidemic in Italy required continuous structural, organisational and staff changes that exposed the study to maturation bias. In particular, the number of laboratory examinations performed upon admission was limited (i.e. Interleukine-6 determination became available only after 15 days from the start of the study). Secondly, only 14.8% of our patients underwent a chest computed tomography upon admission because of barriers in our infrastructure created in order to ensure a dedicated COVID-19 service. Thirdly, it was difficult to ascertain the different effects on outcomes of the miscellaneous and often concomitant drug treatments given to our patients because of the absence of a standard of care for COVID-19 (excluding oxygen supplementation). Nevertheless, as all of the patients admitted to our Infectious Diseases Department were enrolled in this study and the study population was probably representative of the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in Italy in the early stage of the epidemic.",
