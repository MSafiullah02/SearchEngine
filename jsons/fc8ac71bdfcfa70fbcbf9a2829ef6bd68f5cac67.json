            "text": "This year, on the Sunday before the Birth of Saint John the Baptist, after sunset when the moon had first become visible, a marvellous phenomenon appeared to five or more men while sitting facing it. Now there was a bright new moon, and as usual the horns protruded to the east; and lo, suddenly, the upper horn split in two. From the middle of this division a firebrand burst forth, throwing over a considerable distance fire, hot coals and sparks. Meanwhile the body of the moon which was lower [than this] writhed as if troubled, and in the words of those who told this to me and who saw it with their own eyes, the moon throbbed as a beaten snake. It then returned to its former state. This phenomenon was repeated twelve times and more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random then returning to normal. And after these vibrations it became semi-dark from horn to horn, that is, throughout its length. Those men who saw this with their own eyes reported these things to me who writes them; [they are] prepared to give their word or oath that they have added nothing false to the above. Hartung (1976) has argued that this was the first and only sighting, in recorded history of a large asteroid striking the moon and contended that this collision created the twenty-two kilometer-wide crater, known as Giordano Bruno. In contrast, Nininger and Huss (1977) postulated that the twelfth century English eyewitnesses had seen a meteor in the Earth's atmosphere that happened to be in the line of sight of the moon. Calame and Mulholland (1978) , however, strongly support Hartung's position, arguing that the moon was still reverberating from the collision and ringing like a bell. If these authors are correct, the Canterbury eyewitnesses saw an event releasing some 100 000 megatons of energy, that is an event that was ten million times more powerful than the atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki (Ingram 1999) .",

Unlike the Moon, the Earth has retained only a small sample of its population of impact structures as the result of geomorphological processes. Beyond that, since the oceans occupy about 70 percent of the planet's surface, many other near-Earth objects must have struck these areas. Nevertheless, over 160 impact craters have so far been identified on Earth. A complete listing of their size and location is available at the Earth Impact Database (2004) . A further 15 or so major impacts can be recognized in the stratigraphic record (Grieve 1997; Kaiho et al. 2001) . Impact scars range in size from the Vredefort (South Africa), Sudbury (Canada) and Chicxulub (Mexico) craters that are respectively 300, 250 and 170 kilometers in diameter to the 1.5 m Haviland crater in Kansas (Earth Impact Database 2004, Grieve and Kring n.d.) .",

            "text": "Given such enormous range in scale, the consequences of impact must also have differed dramatically. The Chicxulub crater, located under Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, is thought to have been created by an asteroid that was roughly 10 kilometers in diameter. It is estimated that it hit the Earth with the energy equivalent to more than 5 billion Hiroshima atom bombs, that is 100 million megatons (Morrison 1996) . Aside from the initial concussion and heat, two major post-impact events caused massive secondary planetary damage. Large quantities of rock and dust blown out of the crater subsequently rained down as meteors, heating the atmosphere and creating worldwide forest and grassland fires. Not all the dust returned to Earth quickly, however, a finer layer remained suspended in the atmosphere for months, blocking photosynthesis and causing plummeting surface temperatures. It is likely also that the ozone layer was seriously damaged (Birks et al. 2006) . These events triggered massive global terrestrial and marine extinctions, bringing to a close the domination of the dinosaurs and, with it, the end of the Cretaceous Period and Mesozoic Era. It is possible that a similar collision, creating what is now a buried impact crater offshore of Northwestern Australia, may have marked the end of the Permian (Becker et al. 2004 ). The Bedout impact may have triggered the Permian-Triassic extinction in the same way that the Chicxulub impact terminated the Cretaceous era (Kerr 2004) . Indeed, based on variations in sulfur isotopes and the presence of a nickel-rich layer in end-Permian limestone, marl and shale in southern China, Kaiho and colleagues (2001) previously had postulated such an extinction event, caused by a meteorite of up to 60 kilometers in diameter (Ball 2001) . However, controversy continues over whether, or not, the end-Permian ex-tinction event had an extraterrestrial cause (Koeberl and Farley 2004) .",

A larger one impacts the ground at nearly its velocity at the top of the atmosphere producing considerable impact damage. The protection offered by Earth's atmosphere is insidious in that smaller, more frequent impactors such as Tunguska only produce air blast damage and leave no long-term scars on the Earth's surface, while objects 2.5 times larger than it, which hit every few thousand years, cause coherent destruction over many thousands of kilometers of coast. Smaller impactors give no qualitative warning of the enormous destruction wrought when an asteroid larger than the threshold diameter of 200 meters hits an ocean. A water wave generated by an impactor has a long range because it is two-dimensional, so its height falls off inversely with distance from the impact. When the wave strikes a continental shelf, its speed decreases and its height increases to produce tsunamis. The average run-up in height between a deep-water wave and its tsunami is more than an order of magnitude. Tsunamis produce most of the damage from asteroids with diameters between 200 meters and 1 km. An impact anywhere in the Atlantic by an asteroid 400 meters in diameter would devastate the coasts on both sides of the ocean by tsunamis over 100 meters high. An asteroid 5 km in diameter hitting in mid Atlantic would produce tsunami that would inundate the entire upper East Coast of the United States to the Appalachian Mountains.",

On June 30, 1908 a near-Earth object, some 50 to 70 meters in diameter, exploded 8 km above the Stony Tunguska River, in Siberia. Whether it was an asteroid or comet is still in dispute, but the resulting air blast devastated an area of some 2 150 square kilometers. In the hot central epicenter the forest flashed into a huge ascending column of flame that was visible for several hundred kilometers. Fires burned for weeks destroying 1 000 square kilometers of forest. Ash and powdered fragments of tundra were drawn skywards by the fiery vortex and carried around the world by the global air circulation (Gallant n.d.) . The blast felled trees outwards in a radial pattern over an area half the size of Rhode Island. The mass of the object involved was probably about 100 000 tons and the explosion's force some 40 megatons of TNT, that is 2000 times the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb.

From a disaster planning point of view, the most worrisome meteoroids are those that range in size from greater than ten to hundreds of meters in diameter. As pointed out by Chapman (2003) , although impact rates and their consequences vary enormously, they have several important characteristics in common. Whether explosion occurs in the atmosphere, ground surface or ocean they can have devastating consequences. Despite this threat, they are too small to be easily detected or tracked by existing telescope programs, and their impacts are too infrequent and too unpredictable to be studied in detail. As a consequence, their nature and effects are not well understood. This means that \"scientific uncertainties are greatest for just those objects whose sizes and impact frequencies should be of greatest practical concern to public officials\" (Chapman 2003) .",

This is a useful concept, although it must be admitted that it lacks precision. The average American has a 1 in 100 chance of dying in a motor vehicle accident. Other hazards with high probability include homicides, fires and firearm accidents and are likely to be the cause of death of 1 in 300, 800 and 2500 Americans respectively. Americans have a 1 chance in 20 000 of being killed directly, or indirectly, by the impact of an asteroid or comet. A similar probability is given for the likelihood of death in a passenger aircraft crash. In contrast, floods and tornadoes can be expected to kill roughly 1 in 30 000 and 1 in 60 000 Americans respectively (Chapman and Morrison 1994) . If these figures are even of the right order of magnitude, it can be argued that mitigating the adverse impacts of cosmic impacts should be paid at least as much attention as reducing flood and tornado losses.",

Typically limits to what can be successfully accommodated are defined either by law or by common practice. Usually regulations, such as building or public health codes, identify the maximum event that must be guarded against. As a result, the level of socially accepted safety reflects such factors as needs, wants, wealth and past experience (Foster 1980) .

If it does, the most likely point of impact would be the Pacific Ocean. While there is still disagreement about the size of the resulting tsunami, there can be no doubt that it would cause immense damage around the ocean's rim and beyond (Hills and Mader 1977; Ward and Asphaug 2000) . If the impact point of the asteroid were in the center of the Pacific Ocean, within twentyfour hours or so, hundreds of port cities, ranging from Melbourne and Sydney through Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo to Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Valparaiso would have been seriously damaged, if not completely destroyed. Financial losses would inevitably be in the tens if not hundreds of trillions of dollars, causing a collapse of the world's economy. If the Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific and its 26 member states functioned exceptionally well, life loss might be kept in the millions but, if not, or if the impact site was close to one shore or the other, relative mortality rate in coastal areas could exceed that of the Black Death. Obviously, computer generated tsunami risk maps, showing potential inundation from an asteroid strike should be prepared and used to plan evacuation routes and reduce construction on high risk sites. They would not completely prevent either large-scale destruction or loss of life, but they would help in their reduction. They also may be useful tools in encouraging politicians to take cosmic threat seriously. A lack of such tools and associated mitigation planning were responsible for much of the life loss around the Indian Ocean, caused by the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake on the 26 th December 2004 (Lay et al. 2005) .",

That is, those parts of these grids that are unlikely to suffer tsunami damage should be capable of autonomous operation. Such design would make them far less susceptible to other hazards, including earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist attack. Greater functional redundancy would also help to protect against total collapse given serious damage to coastal areas. Beyond this, as little as possible that is irreplaceable should be immobile, especially if it is normally located in a high risk zone. Early detection of near Earth objects speaks for itself.

In 1970, for example, Whalin and coworkers described a scale representation of the harbor at San Diego, California. This model was built to investigate the impact of deep-water wave heights from about 4 to 15 meters. Such waves could be generated by localized seismic disturbances, an explosion, a massive landslide, or the impact of a meteorite. They concluded, as the result of experiments conducted with their scale model, that waves of this magnitude would cause extensive inundation of the Silver Strand, the city of Coronado, and parts of the North Island.

Regardless of the hazard involved, the construction of such models require four common steps. The first is an analysis of the physical characteristics of the hazard. This allows the subsequent development of a mathematical model capable of forecasting the severity and frequency of its impact. The approach taken is to develop a model that can produce a spatial representation of intensities with properly spaced contours, which are consistent with the size, shape and configuration of observed patterns. This distribution will be controlled by the magnitude of the event, modified by the impact of certain local variables. In the case of a tsunami generated by an asteroid, the scale of inundation and associated damage would reflect size and speed of the impactor, its location in the ocean, and the presence or absence of local features such as bays, reefs, submarine ridges, canyons and the width of the continental shelf.",

Foster and Carey (1976) , for example, produced such a matrix for the simulations of earthquake damage in Victoria, British Columbia.

This produces a synthetic, computer simulation of the disaster experience that can be represented in terms of economic loss, degree of damage to particular buildings, and fatalities and injuries sustained.",

Members of the Spaceguard search programs include the Lowell Observatory's LONEOS in Flagstaff, Arizona, Jet Propulsion Laboratory's near-Earth Asteroid Tracking [NEAT] facility, located in Maui and on Mt. Palomar, California and Spacewatch on Arizona's Kitt Peak (Chapman 2004 ). In addition, the International Spaceguard Foundation is centerd in Italy. This consists of a team of astronomers who collaborate by e-mail whenever one discovers a particularly threatening Near-Earth-asteroid. This global network of professional and ama-teur observers continues to discover a new Near-Earth-asteroid every few days. As of February 2004, almost 2 670 have been found, some 600 of which are potentially hazardous. As Chapman (2004) points out, this compares with only 18 that were known in 1981. It is believed that the census is complete for near-Earth-asteroids greater than 3 kilometers in diameter. The estimated number of near-Earth-asteroids greater than one kilometer in diameter is some (1 100 \u00b1 200) (Bottke 2006) . About 55 percent of this total had been identified by early 2004. NASA also supports a Near-Earth Object Program that was established in 1998 to help coordinate and provide a focal point for research into asteroids and comets that approach the Earth's orbit. It operates from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and provides data on the recent approaches to the Earth, including the name of the object, its closest approach date, miss distance, estimated diameter and relative velocity. On June 27, 2004, when the author visited this website (NASA 2004) 40 such objects were listed, varying in size from an estimated 900 m-2.0 km to 15 m-34 m in diameter, with miss distances reaching a minimum of 1.5LD (1 LD [lunar distance] =~384 000 kilometers).",

Firstly, the possibility of deflecting or destroying smaller comets or asteroids, so that an Earth impact is prevented, needs detailed consideration. A wide range of approaches to impact prevention has been put forward in the literature. Mitigation subsystems might involve rocket propulsion, rocket-delivered nuclear warheads, kinetic energy systems using projectiles, directed energy from lasers, mass drivers, solar sails and biological, chemical or mechanical asteroid and/or comet \"eaters\". Suggestions have been made also of super magnetic field generators and futuristic force fields, tractor beams and gravity manipulation (Morrison 1996 (Morrison , 2004a Simon 2002) . Considerable progress has been made very recently in this area. The NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts has just announced five Phase II awards for the further development of revolutionary advanced concepts to help protect the Earth from cosmic collision (NIAC 2004) . Beyond this, the European Space Agency has given priority to \"Don Quijot\u00e9\", selected from six potential asteroid protection missions. This will involve an asteroid 500 meters in diameter and two spacecraft, Sancho and Hidalgo. Sancho will arrive first and orbit the asteroid for several months, deploying penetrating probes to form a seismic network. When this is ready, and adequate data has been collected, Hidalgo will arrive, crashing into the asteroid at about 10 kilometers per second. Sancho would then study the changes in the asteroid's orbit, rotation and structure caused by Hidalgo's impact. This information will give insights into what is needed to modify the orbit of any similar asteroid that may threaten Earth (Morrison 2004b) . The United States is currently installing a missile defense system (Missile Defense Agency 2005). With greater international cooperation, this might be expanded to provide the capacity to protect the planet against errant near-Earth-objects, including medium-sized asteroids.",

Once an expert consensus has been reached, the major issue of adequate tsunami warnings and associated evacuations must be addressed. While there is an effective tsunami warning network for the Pacific, nothing comparable exists elsewhere. How then could warnings and evacuation be effectively organized for the populations of low lying coastal areas around the Atlantic, Arctic and Indian oceans? How could the evacuation of the total populations of low altitude countries like the Netherlands and Bangladesh be organized? What about that around the Mediterranean or the Great Lakes? What about islands without central mountain cores, such as the Marshall and Tokelau Islands? The issues are enormous and the logistics far beyond anything humanity has ever attempted. It seems much more likely that, rather than face up to these problems, many decision-makers would prepare to issue warnings of impending impact together with the advice to 'duck, hide, hope and pray' (cf. Stirton 1971). Table 27 .4, of course, provides an insight into a little of what is really needed.",

The former was completely demolished by a nu\u00e9e ardente, a glowing avalanche of gas and debris ejected from Mount Pel\u00e9 and the latter buried beneath sediments deposited by an earthquaketriggered avalanche (Griggs and Gilchrist 1983;  Office of Emergency Preparedness 1972). Nevertheless, civilizations have been destroyed by natural hazards. To illustrate, the tsunami that swept the lowlands of the Mediterranean Sea (circa 1450 to 1480 BC) generated by the eruption of the volcano of Santorini, likely decimated the Minoans (Foster 1980) .",
