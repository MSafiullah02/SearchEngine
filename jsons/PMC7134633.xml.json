These methods are the diagnostic tools most easily applied as near-patient tests, but development is reliant on the identification of suitable antigens that are present in detectable quantities in clinical specimens. To date, commercial assays have been developed only for a limited range of pathogens. The most widely available assays have focused on the detection of selected bacterial pathogens in urine and the detection of viruses in respiratory specimens.",

A newer generation immunochromatographic test that detects the C-polysaccharide cell wall antigen in urine (NOW) has been an important advance in the diagnosis of pneumococcal disease.4 This test has a sensitivity of 70% to 80% and a specificity of greater than 90% compared with conventional diagnostic methods for detection of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Unfortunately, the NOW test cannot be used reliably in children as it also detects pneumococcal carriage.5 Alternative pneumococcal antigens for diagnostic purposes, such as pneumolysin, have shown promising results, although none has been demonstrated to perform better than existing commercial C-polysaccharide antigen assays.6, 7, 8 The combination of a pneumolysin-specific antigen detection ELISA together with the NOW test may result in a better diagnostic yield because of the higher specificity of the pneumolysin detection ELISA.7\n",

These assays require technical expertise and have the advantage of allowing direct evaluation of specimen quality. More recently, commercial rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have become widely used for the detection of influenza or RSV directly in respiratory specimens. These diagnostic test kits, produced as dipsticks, cassettes, or cards, contain internal controls, and a positive result is signaled by a color change. Results are produced by these tests within 5 to 40 minutes.",

In practice, PCR has been successfully used to rapidly diagnose mycoplasma pneumonia during outbreaks, and was particularly useful in children, immunocompromised patients, and in early-stage disease.65, 66\n",

Advances in this area have been relatively slow, with NAATs for mycobacteria failing to provide greater sensitivity than culture-based methods. The relatively high false-negative rate with NAATs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis probably reflects a combination of the paucibacillary nature of samples, presence of inhibitors in samples, and suboptimal DNA extraction methods. The situation is changing, with new developments in rapid diagnosis and antibiotic susceptibility testing.82 For direct detection of M tuberculosis in respiratory samples, all commercial assays have high specificity (>98%), but variable sensitivities: 90% to 100% for smear-positive samples and 33% to 100% for smear-negative samples.27 Consequently, it is recommended that use of these tests is restricted to only smear-positive samples. Evaluations of PCR for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in high-prevalence populations have been promising.83, 84, 85, 86 Alternative strategies under development to diagnose tuberculosis by molecular tools include detection of mycobacterial DNA in urine87, 88 and direct detection in respiratory specimens by microarray.89\n",

These methods are among the most attractive diagnostic tools, but further development is reliant on the discovery of suitable antigens that can be reliably detected in readily obtained specimens. NAATs have now been developed to a stage where multiplex assays that detect the common respiratory pathogens are commercially available, although not all have been rigorously evaluated in clinical settings. Further improvements in design and performance are expected, and an emphasis should be placed on clarifying the clinical usefulness of NAATs, developing standardized methods, producing even more user-friendly platforms, and exploring the role of quantitative assays. New approaches for respiratory pathogen detection are desperately needed. Breath analysis is an exciting new area with enormous potential, and it will be interesting to follow progress in this area over the next few years.",
