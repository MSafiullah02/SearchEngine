The failure of many conventional approaches results from their neglection of feedback loops, instabilities and/or cascade effects, due to which equilibrium models do often not provide a good picture of the actual system behavior. However, the complex and often counter-intuitive behavior of social systems and their macro-level collective dynamics can be understood by means of complexity science, which enables one to address the aforementioned problems more successfully. We highlight that a suitable system design and management can help to stop undesirable cascade effects and to enable favorable kinds of self-organization in the system. In such a way, complexity science can help to save human lives.",

In this paper, we will pay particular attention to the problem of collective dynamics in human populations [1] [2] [3] . Topics addressed range from crowd disasters [4] to crime [5, 6] , terrorism [7] [8] [9] , wars [10] [11] [12] , and the epidemic spreading of diseases [13, 14] . Recently, these fields have evolved towards increasingly quantitative, realistic, and even predictive models, bringing together statistical data analysis, modeling efforts, analytical approaches, and laboratory experiments. These advances make the research described in this paper applicable to real-life situations, creating the opportunity to employ scientific knowledge to save human lives.",

In traffic flows, for example, researchers have found that \"phantom\" traffic jams can occur in the absence of accidents or bottlenecks [16, 17] . Despite the drivers' best efforts to prevent traffic jams, they are unavoidable if the vehicle density crosses a certain threshold [18, 19] . At high densities, small variations in speed are amplified from one driver to the next, causing a cascade effect. This ends in a situation undesirable for all, in which every driver is stopped. What, then, can be done to prevent these systemic instabilities? We suggest here that a better scientific understanding, based on methods from complexity science, can help. For example, despite the complexity of traffic patterns [20] , they can be described well by analytic and predictive models [18] . This has enabled traffic assistance systems based on a distributed control approach and bottom-up self-organization, which can be used for effective congestion avoidance [21, 22] . Surprisingly, well-designed self-regulation here outperforms classical top down control.",

In fact, the number of crowd disasters and the overall number of fatalities are even on the rise, probably as a result of the increasing frequency and size of mass events (see Fig.1 ). The classical approach to the avoidance of crowd disasters is reflected by the concept of \"crowd control\". This assumes that it is necessary to \"make people behave\". The concept is somewhat similar to how the police sometimes handles violent demonstrations and riots. For example, tear gas and police cordons are used with the intention to gain control over crowds. However, there is evidence that such measures, which are usually intended to improve the safety of the crowd, have sometimes unintentionally deteriorated the situation. For example, the use of tear gas may have played a significant role in the crowd disasters in Lima, Peru (1998) Our approach in the following is to clarify the cause of crowd disasters and afterwards discuss simple rules to improve crowd safety, oriented at giving more control to the individuals over the situation they are in (\"empowerment\"). This strategy can 1. The term \"pushing\" suggests that people are relentlessly pushing towards their destination, disregarding the situation of others. However, when the density in the crowd is very high, even inadvertent body movements will cause physical interactions with others. The forces transmitted by such involuntary body interactions may add up from one body to the next, thereby causing a situation where people are unintentionally pushed around in the crowd. This situation is hard to distinguish from intentional pushing.",

            "text": "In sharp contrast to this, it turns out that many crowd disasters do not result from a \"stampede\" or \"mass panic\" [26] . Prior to 2007, crowd-flow theory generally assumed a state of equilibrium in the crowd, where each level of crowd density (1/m 2 ) could be mapped to a corresponding value of the crowd flow (1/m/s). This assumption turned out to be approximately correct for low-to-medium levels of crowd density. However, it was later found [27] that at very high density the crowd is driven far from equilibrium into a state of turbulence. In many cases, fatalities result from a phenomenon called \"crowd turbulence\", which results when the density in the crowd is so high that bodies automatically touch each other. As a result, physical forces are transmitted from one body to another-a process that is unavoidable under such conditions. These forces may add up and create force chains that cause sudden subsequent pushes from various directions, which can be hardly anticipated. Eventually, the individuals are pushed so much that one or some of them may stumble and fall to the ground. This creates a \"hole\" in the crowd, which breaks the balance of forces for the surrounding people: they are pushed from behind, but not anymore from the front, such that they are either forced to step on fallen persons (\"trampling\") or they will also fall. Due to this domino effect, such \"holes\" eventually grow bigger and bigger (a situation that may be coined \"black hole effect\"). That is, the areas of where people have fallen to the ground, or typically on top of one another, are growing overtime. This explains the phenomenon of piles of people often identified as causes of crowd disasters and interpreted as instances of trampling. Under such conditions, it is extremely difficult for individuals to get back on their feet and people on the ground eventually die of suffocation. With the weight of others on top of them, they cannot breathe well enough.",

All elements of the plan, should be exercised before, including contingency plans. In case of the reorganization of the annual pilgrimage in Saudi-Arabia (\"Hajj\"), for example, many elements were combined to increase the level of safety. This included [32] While sophisticated procedures combining expert consulting, computer simulations and video monitoring remain the safest way to avoid accidents, most event organizers are not in a position to undertake them all. In fact, such complex procedures are often expensive and turn out to be cost-effective only for large events, or if mass events are regularly held at the same place (e.g. the Muslim pilgrimage in Mecca). Hence, organizers of small-and intermediate-size events are often constrained to rely on their intuition and past experience to assess the safety of the events they are in charge of. However, the dynamics of crowd behavior is complex and often counterintuitive. A systemic failure is usually not the result of one single and well-identifiable factor. Instead, it is the interaction between many factors that cause a situation to get out of control, while each factor alone does not necessarily constitute the source of disaster per se [26] .",

Even though this is a well-established fact in academic circles, it remains a frequent source of crowd disasters [26] . Likewise, the topology of the environment plays a crucial role to ensure a smooth flow of people. Avoiding bottlenecks is probably the most important recommendation. The problems implied by bottlenecks have been demonstrated with many computer simulations, regardless of the underlying model [28, 29, 33] . Bottlenecks exacerbate the physical pressure among neighboring individuals, and create the initial perturbations that might trigger crowd turbulence. Furthermore, bottlenecks produce long queues and excessive waiting times. Therefore, while people naturally keep reasonable distances between each other, they tend to become impatient and reduce inter-individual distances when their perceived progress towards the goal is too slow. This causes a vicious circle: The increasing local density reduces the flow through the bottleneck, and the reduced flow further increases the local density. Importantly, bottlenecks do not only result from the static environment, but can also be created dynamically by other external factors. Ambulances, police cars, people sitting on the ground, lost belongings, or temporary fences often create bottleneck situations that were not initially foreseen. Another less intuitive side-effect is that the temporary widening of pathways can be dangerous as well, because people typically make use of the additional space to overtake those who walk in front of them, creating bottleneck situations when the pathway narrows to its normal width. Finally, recent computer simulations have revealed that sharp turns increase the physical pressure around the inner edge of the bend [28] . Even though turnings are not necessarily dangerous, they constitute potential zones of danger in case of unexpected overcrowding.",

Clear signs of emergency, such as people falling or calling for help usually happen at a stage that is already critical and does not enable a timely response. The most accurate indicator of danger is the local density level. Recent studies have revealed the existence of local density thresholds above which the danger to the crowd is significantly increased [28] : Stopand-go waves tend to emerge beyond 2-4 p/m 2 , while crowd turbulence is likely to occur above 4-7 p/m 2 , depending on the average body diameter. The problem is that local densities are hard to measure without a proper monitoring system, which is not available at many mass events. Nevertheless, crowd managers can make use of simple signs as a proxy for local density. For example, one may observe the frequency and strength of body contacts among neighboring people. Typically, when the frequency of involuntary body contacts increases -often perceived as pushy behavior -this indicates that pressure in the crowd builds up and pressure relief strategies are needed. Crowd managers should also be alerted by the emergence of stop-and-go-waves, a 9 self-organized phenomenon characterized by alternating moving and stopping phases, which is visible to the naked eye [27, 28] . As this stop-and-go pattern is related with a reduced flow of people, the density may quickly increase due to the vicious circle effect, so that measures for pressure relief must be taken. Finally, behaviors such as people climbing walls, overcoming fences, or disrespecting conventional routes -often interpreted as relentless and aggressive behaviors -may indicate escape attempts. They should be considered as a serious warning signal of a possible, upcoming crowd disaster.",

A reliable flow of information between the visitors of an event, the organizers, security staff, police and ambulance is crucial for coordination. In fact, visitors often become aware of developing congestion too late because of the short-range visibility in crowded areas. This may impair orientation, which further increases the problems in the critical zone. In such situations, calm but clear loud speaker announcements informing visitors and well visible, variable message signs can let people know why they have to wait and what they should do. A robust communication system often constitutes the last means to gain control before a situation gets out of hand. It is also important that crowd managers have a reliable overview of the situation. Existing technologies offer useful monitoring systems that allow for real-time measurements of density levels and predictions of future crowd movements (see e.g. section 2.3 describing the use of smartphone applications for inferring crowd density). While such sophisticated monitoring systems are among the most efficient ways to keep track of the situation, most events are not yet using them. The minimum necessary requirement, however, is a video monitoring covering the relevant zones of the event, from which the organizers can precisely evaluate the crowd movements and earlier detect signs of upcoming congestion.",

In international comparison this implies that with only a twentieth of the world population, the US accounts for a quarter of the world wide prison population [42] . 3 It is also interesting to note that a single prisoner annually costs more than the pay of a postdoctoral researcher. For a recent study on US prison costs per inmate see [44] . show averages of US States with very high (black), high (red), moderate (green) and low (blue) crime rates. The four categories are obtained through grouping US States by their average crime rate over the period 1965-2010 and then assigning the 25% most affected States to the first category, the 25% next most affected States to the second category, etc. Examples of US States with very high crime rates are Washington D.C. and New York.

The homicide rate in the United States, for example, began to rise steadily in the 1960s and oscillated at around 8 to 10 homicides per 100,000 for 20 years. It only started to significantly decline in the early 1990s (see Fig. 9B ). In fact, such fluctuations in the frequency of crime are visible across a wide and diverse spectrum of criminal offenses, suggesting that cyclic recurrence is a fundamental characteristic of crime (see Fig. 9C ). This observation is notable, in particular, as different criminal offenses -homicide and theft, for example -are thought to arise from different kinds of motivations: homicides are usually assumed to be related to manifestations of aggression, whereas theft is most often economically motivated [47] .",

Each player trends to imitate the strategy of the best performing neighbor. 5 The game is staged on a L \u00d7 L square lattice with periodic boundary conditions, where individuals play the game with their k = 4 nearest neighbors.

The introduction of dimensionless parameters is possible in the form of \"(relative) inspection costs\" \u03b1 = c/ f , the \"(relative) temptation\" \u03b2 = g/ f , and the \"(relative) inspection incentive\" \u03b3 = r/ f , which leads to the following payoffs:",

Monte Carlo simulations are performed as described in the Methods section of Ref. [6] . The collective spatio-temporal dynamics of this simple spatial inspection game is complex and counter-intuitive, capturing the essence of the crime-fighting problem well. One can observe various phase transitions between different kinds of collective outcomes, as demonstrated in Fig. 10 . The phase transitions are either continuous (solid lines in Fig. 10 ) or discontinuous (dashed lines in Fig. 10 ), and this differs markedly from what would be expected according to the rational choice equation (7) or the well-mixed model [65] , namely due to the significant effects of inspection and spatial interactions. Four different situations can be distinguished: Figure 11 provides a more detailed quantitative analysis, displaying in panel (A) the sudden first-order phase transitions from the C + O + P phase to the pure P phase, and from this pure P phase to the pure C phase, as inspection costs \u03b1 increase. In panel (B), we also observe a sudden, discontinuous phase transition, emerging as neighboring individuals are rewired. This introduces a small-world effect. We observe that conflicts escalate in amplitude until an absorbing phase is reached. It follows that the exact impact of each specific parameter variation depends strongly on the location within the phase diagram, i.e. the exact parameter combination. General statements such as \"increasing the fine reduces criminal activity\" tend to be wrong, which contradicts the widely established point of view. This may explain why empirical evidence is not in agreement with common theoretical expectations, and it also means we need to reconsider the traditional perspective on crime.",

The insurgencies that followed the US-lead interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq have caused civilian casualties in the order of hundreds of thousands while the US-declared \"war on terror\" has not significantly curbed international terrorist activity (Fig.12 ). In fact, in the political arena, critics argue that international interventions may themselves serve as triggers for terrorist attacks while others suggest the exact opposite, i.e. that only the decisive interventions and aggressive measures against terrorist organizations have stopped a much more severe escalation of There are no studies to date that can convincingly support either of the above views and establish a clear causal relationship between international terrorist activities and the \"war on terror\". At the level of individual conflicts, however, there are a number of studies that have helped to clarify the link between interventions and levels of violence [69] [70] [71] [72] . These studies in particular emphasize reactive or \"tit-for-tat\" dynamics as a fundamental endogenous mechanism responsible for both escalation and de-escalation of conflict. In the context of Iraq, one can find such reactive dynamics for both insurgent and coalition forces [70, 71] . Other research has identified similar dynamics in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where both the Israeli and Palestinian side were found to significantly react to violent attacks of the opposing side [73] . Establishing the (causal) effect of actions by one conflict party on the reactions of the other faction(s) thus appears central to a systemic understanding of endogenous conflict processes.",

            "text": "While such statistical signatures point to similarities in conflict patterns across cases and help identify general conflict mechanisms, detailed case studies on the micro-dynamics of violence suggest that mechanisms at the group-or individual-level may be very conflict-and context-specific [77] . A number of micro-level mechanisms that all contribute to the aggregate violence patterns are likely to be present in many conflicts (see, for example Ref. [78] ). The effect of (local) contact between warring factions on levels of violence, for instance, has been of central interest in conflict studies. Examining violence in Jerusalem between 2001 and 2009, a recent study addresses this question using an innovative combination of formal computational modeling and rich, spatially disaggregated data on violent incidents and contextual variables [79] . Past research has given empirical support for two competing perspectives: In 2006 ad 2007, the timing of events correlates significantly in time, i.e. the signature of inter-event times (D) significantly deviates from the exponential timing signature that is characteristic for uncorrelated event timing. In contrast, prior to 2006 (C) and after 2007 (E) event timing is indistinguishable from that of a random process with exponentially distributed inter-event times. (F) Shows the number of events per day in Baghdad for the whole period considered. The black bar indicates where an Anderson-Darling test rejects the hypothesis of exponential distribution of inter-event times at a 5% significance level for moving windows of 6 months, i.e. where the event timing signature is non-trivial. Note that timing analysis was performed for the greater Baghdad area to avoid spurious timing signatures of unrelated events (see also the discussion in the text). The data were obtained from the Guardian website [75] ; fit lines shown were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation [76] . 26",

            "text": "One key difficulty in research on the micro-dynamics of conflict is focusing on the \"correct\" theoretically and empirically plausible mechanisms that drive violence. In the study on Jerusalem, for example, one specific mechanism was shown to account for a significant part of the spatial patterns of violence in the city. This and similar studies are powerful in the sense that they explicitly test a particular causal micro-macro-link. Similarly, one may reverse this process and try to infer microprocesses based on the macro-patterns. Recently, such causal inference designs have been extended to be applicable to micro-level conflict event data. A novel inferential technique called Matched Wake Analysis (MWA) [80] estimates the causal effect of different types of conflict events on the subsequent conflict trajectory. Using sliding spatial and temporal windows around intervention events guarantees that the choice of unit of analysis does not systematically bias inferences, a problem known as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) [81, 82] . For robust causal inference the method uses statistical matching [83] on previous conflict trends and geographic covariates. In order to the estimate average treatment effects for one type of event (treatment) relative to another one (control) the method uses a Difference-in-Differences regression design. Formally, it estimates how the number of dependent events after interventions, n post , changes compared to the number of dependent events prior, n pre , as a function of the interventions: 7 n post = \u03b2 0 + \u03b2 1 \u00b7 n pre + \u03b2 2 \u00b7 treatment + u (13) In this expression \u03b2 2 is the estimated average treatment effect of the treated, our quantity of interest (see Ref. [80] for further details on the method). Such inferential methodology is especially useful when testing specific causal hypotheses, in particular those that may otherwise be difficult to detect against the background of large-scale violence unrelated to the hypothesized mechanism. We have previously emphasized the importance of reactive dynamics for an understanding of endogenous conflict processes. One such example is the effects of counterinsurgency measures on the level of insurgent violence. The direction of these effects is generally disputed, both theoretically and empirically. One line of reasoning suggests that hurting civilians indiscriminately will generally cause reactive support for the military adversary [71, 84] . Another line of thinking suggests that the deterrent effect of such measures leads to less support for the adversary [69, 85] .",

Specifically, we focus on the greater Baghdad area -the focal area of violence -and consider three frequent types of events. Raids refer to surprise attacks on homes and compounds, in which the military suspects insurgents or arms caches. The relative heavy-handedness and the high probability of disturbing or harming innocent bystanders sets these operations apart from more selective detentions. In turn, to attack incumbent forces insurgents frequently rely on Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and civilian support in manufacturing, transporting, and planting them. If civilians were really more inclined to support the strategic adversary after having been targeted in raids, one would expect more IED attacks to take place after and in the spatial vicinity of raids compared to detentions or arrests under otherwise comparable conditions. The opposite should be true if deterrence (by raids) was the mechanism at work. As visible in Fig. 14 , raids lead to higher levels of subsequent IED attacks compared to detentions: our estimates suggest that 2-3 raids, lead to one additional IED attack in the direct spatial vicinity 7 treatment is a boolean marking whether the intervention is of the treatment or control type. (B) Estimated change in the number of attacks with Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) following raids in comparison to those following detentions. After matching on spatial covariates and trends in IED attacks preceding the interventions, the causal effect of raids vs. detentions was estimated with a Difference-in-Differences regression design [80] . Note the noticeable positive effect (lighter colors) in the interpretable (non-shaded) areas of the plot at distances up to about 3 kilometers and 10-12 days: on average for every 2-3 raids one more IED attack is observed compared to less heavy-handed interventions. Data used for this analysis are significant action (SIGACT) military data (see for example Ref. [71] ). within up to 10-12 days. This result thus lends empirical support to the notion that civilians support the adversary in reaction to indiscriminate violence. Based on such improved methodology for studying micro-level processes in conflicts, it is possible to gain a better and systematic understanding of the driving forces behind violence.",

Moreover, seemingly large events may not always be cause for alarm whereas small events may greatly matter.

The outbreak of conflict is rarely unavoidable.

Yet, escalation is rarely linear, and its outcome remains uncertain until the very end. A negotiated solution Figure 15 : Estimated probability distribution of the (logged) number of conflict-related news for all countries and all weeks since 1902.

Each vertical line is a boxplot of the bootstrapped median number of conflictrelated news prior to all interstate wars since 1902.

We will now address another serious threat, the emergence and worldwide spread of infectious diseases. Pandemics have plagued mankind since the onset of Figure 18 : Pandemics of the past and present. Global disease proliferation has been prevalent throughout human history. Before worldwide eradication in 1979, smallpox had claimed the largest death toll since its emergence approx. 5000 yrs. ago followed by measles which is believed to have killed a substantial fraction of native Americans in the times after Columbus. Both, the Justinian Plague and the Black Death were caused by bacterial diseases and each one killed more than half the European population in a few years. The 20th century Spanish flu claimed more victims that world war I and HIV/AIDS is the most recent globally prevalent non-curable infectious disease. civilization. The transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer life styles to settled cultures marked a point in history at which growing human populations in combination with increasingly cultured life-stock, led to zoonotic infectious diseases crossing the intra-species barrier. New pathogens that could be sustained in human populations evolved, and eventually lead to infectious diseases specific to humans. It is thus no surprise that the greatest killer among viral diseases, the smallpox virus emerged approx. 4000-7000 years ago [110] . It is estimated that smallpox alone has caused between 300 and 500 million deaths and along with measles killed up 90% of the native American population in the years that followed contact with Europeans in the 15th century. Historic records indicate that various large scale pandemics with devastating consequences swept through Europe in the past two millennia. The Antonine Plague (smallpox or measles) killed up to 5 million people in ancient Rome and has been argued to be one of the factors that lead to the destabilization of the Roman Empire [111] , while the Black Death (bubonic plague) swept across the European continent in the 14th century and erased more than 25% of the European population in its wake [112] . The largest known pandemic in history, the Spanish flu of 1918-19 caused an estimated 20-50 million deaths worldwide within a year, more than the casualties of World War I over the following 4 years. This pandemic was caused by an influenza A virus subtype H1N1, a similar strain that triggered the 2009 influenza pandemic (\"swine flu\"). Although all of these major events are unique and different from each other in a number of ways, a number of factors are common to all of them. First, increasing interactions with animal populations in farming increases the likelihood that novel pathogens are introduced to human populations. Second, larger and denser human populations increase the opportunity for pathogens to evolve the ability to be sustained in these populations, adapt to the new human host and trigger local outbreaks. Third, increasing mobility, for instance driven by trade and commerce, promotes the spatial distribution of emergent pathogens and generates the conditions for full-blown pandemics to follow a local outbreak phenomenon.",

The greatest success along these lines is the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1979 by a decade long global vaccination campaign. Today, worldwide health surveillance systems are in place that are key to timely outbreak identification, containing emergent infectious disease, and combating endemic diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and malaria. However, although advances along these lines are promising news, modern civilization also improves the conditions for the emergence of new pandemics. First, intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production yields a higher rate of intra-species barrier crossing and thus the emergence of potentially virulent human infectious diseases. Second, worldwide population increases exponentially, having crossed the 7 billion mark only recently with more than 50% living in dense metropolitan mega cities, perfect conditions for an emergent pathogen to be sustained by human-to-human contacts. Third, the modern world is extremely connected by intense long range traffic, more than three billion passengers travel among four thousand globally distributed airports every year.",

In 1766 Daniel Bernoulli published a paper on the effectiveness of inoculation against smallpox infections [121] . Not only did his seminal work contain the first application of the theory of differential equations, a mathematical technique quite novel at that time. His paper was also published before it was known that infectious diseases were caused by bacteria or viruses and were transmissible. The prevalent scientific opinion in Bernoulli's time was that infectious diseases were caused by an invisible poisonous vapor, known as the miasma. Evidence existed, however, that inoculation of healthy individuals with degraded smallpox material incurred immunity to smallpox in some cases and Bernoulli's theoretical work shed light on the effectiveness of this procedure, a topic vividly discuss within the scientific elite of Europe at that time. In the beginning of the 20th century Kermack and McKendrick laid the foundation of mathematical epidemiology in a series of publications [122, 123] and introduced the SIR (susceptible -infected -recovered) model which is still used today in most state-of-the-art computational models for the dynamics of infectious Figure 19 : Global connectivity in the 21st century: Heterogeneity and lack of scale.

The combination of local, initially exponential growth, typical for disease dynamics, with diffusion in space generically yields regular wave fronts and constant spreading speeds. This type of approach was successfully applied in the context the spread of the Black Death in Europe in the 14th century [127] .

This is illustrated in Fig. 19 which shows the worldwide air transportation network. This network connects approx. four thousand airports worldwide and transports more than three billion passengers every year. The strong spatial heterogeneity of the human population in combination with the lack of scale in global mobility no longer lead to regular wave patterns of global disease spread as examples of the recent past have shown. SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003 initially proliferated in China and shortly after its arrival in Hong Kong cases were reported in Canada, the United States and Europe. In 2009, the H1N1 pandemic started in Mexico, quickly reached the US and subsequently arrived in Europe and elsewhere in the world. The spread of modern epidemics is spatially incoherent and chaotic, generically does note bear any metric regularity and observed spatio-temporal patterns depend sensitively on the outbreak location. All these factors complicate the development of predictive tools that can forecast the time course of emergent infectious diseases.",

The approach accounts for a diverse set of mobility patterns, e.g. bi-directional movements between origin and destination, one can define different mobility patterns for host individuals in different infectious states, hospitalization, vaccination, age structure at every location and seasonality can be incorporated in the model setup, see Fig. 20 .

Today, GLEAM represents one of the most sophisticated and powerful simulation frameworks for global disease dynamics and has been employed in a variety of context. in little time. A clear advantage of the GLEAM software is that entire sets of fully stochastic simulations can be performed in order to compute confidence intervals along with the most probable time course. In this respect the design of the GLEAM infrastructure is similar to modern weather forecast systems.

Furthermore, the level of details these models incorporate also implies an abundance of parameters that either must be assumed or in some cases guessed. Generically these parameters interact non-linearly in a given model and despite their predictive power, it is difficult to assess which parameters are important and which are less significant. It is safe to say that currently we lack a full understanding of the dynamic richness of these highly detailed models and therefore also of the phenomena they describe. Another drawback of purely detailed computational approaches is the fact that parameter values must be chosen and fixed to run a specific computer simulation. This is particularly challenging when new infectious agents emerge for which none of the vital disease specific parameters are known. Consequently, at the onset of an emergent epidemic even the most sophisticated simulation frameworks have to be employed with great caution, because, despite their potential to model the phenomenon in a very detailed way, a significant level of uncertainty remains concerning the choices of sensitive parameters.",

Most importantly, detailed computational models that incorporate all potentially relevant factors ab initio fail to inform which factors are actually relevant, and which ones are not [131] . Gaining a better understanding of the phenomenon however is particularly important because based on a deeper understanding we can potentially predict certain aspects about the most likely time course of a global epidemic even when a set of parameters is unknown. One approach along this line of reasoning was recently introduced [14] . In this study, the authors introduced the notion of effective distance to replace conventional geographic distance which substantially simplified the complexity of the spatio-temporal dynamics of global diseases. This approach showed that when effective distance is used, even complex network-driven contagion phenomena can be understood in the framework of ordinary reaction-diffusion dynamics. When this technique is applied, spreading phenomena that appear to be complex in conventional geographic representations, possess simple wave fronts and constant speeds when effective distance replaces geographic distance. Thus, the key result of the study was that the observed complexity is predominantly caused by the inappropriate and antiquated use of distance that no longer applies today.",

The complexity of the above model is encapsulated in the flux fraction matrix elements P mn which is shaped by the spatial heterogeneity of the metapopulation and the multiscale properties of the global mobility network. It is this coupling matrix that causes solutions of the above model to appear spatiotemporally complex, as is shown in Fig. 21 . The figure depicts temporal snapshots of two simulated pandemics (i.e. solutions to Eqs. (19) ) with initial outbreaks in London and Chicago. Because of the inherent complexity in the global mobility network, i.e. the coupling matrix P nm , the patterns appear to be complex, spatially incoherent and quickly lose any correlation to their initial outbreak location. Clearly, no geographic wave front is discernible except in the very beginning of the spreading process. The lack of geographic imprint makes it difficult to predict arrival time sequences from the maps alone. Furthermore, the geographic de-correlation makes it impossible to reconstruct the initial outbreak location based on a single temporal snapshot of the process. Unlike historic spreading processes that evolved according to more regular wave propagation, modern global disease dynamics make it difficult to define a proper propagation speed by, for instance, correlating geographic distance with arrival times. Because the spatio-temporal complexity generated by the model is caused by the coupling matrix P nm a plausible strategy for defining an effective distance measure must relate this distance to this coupling matrix.

This is very valuable information during the onset of an epidemic and one can initiate effective containment strategies with minimal information concerning the disease.

The effective distance approach can help reconstruct the outbreak origin by identifying the node from which the observed pattern appears to be most regular. This approach has been able to successfully reconstruct outbreak origins of recent contagion phenomena, e.g. the foodborne disease EHEC/HUS that struck Germany and its European neighbors in 2011.",

Beyond ethical and political concerns, the efficacy of compulsory vaccination programs may be constrained by (1) the limited information available to those designing the policies, and (2) uncertainty about how people will change their behavior [138] in response to the information they receive as an epidemic progresses. Here we will investigate when voluntary vaccination [139, 140] can be a viable alternative to imposing immunization in a top-down way. That is, we use a model to determine if and when information about the risk of becoming ill will enable individuals to voluntarily make decisions that are beneficial, not only to their own health, but also to the health of many others.",

In this framework an individual that vaccinates will incur a cost c v (the cost of vaccination) and one that becomes ill will incur the cost of infection c i (we assume that vaccines have 100% efficacy and thus vaccinated individuals will never become infected, but this assumption can be easily relaxed). Therefore, the expected cost to an individual who vaccinates is c v . Meanwhile, the expected cost to an individual who does not vaccinate is c i R, where R is an individual's estimate of the probability that she will fall ill if she does not vaccinate.

However, as discussed in Sec. 4.1, the complex contact patterns between individuals, which mediate the spread of diseases in the real world, lead to spatio-temporal variation in infection levels. Therefore, we ask how the effectiveness of voluntary vaccination changes when individuals make immunization choices using information that incorporates this variability. To answer this question we introduce a model where individuals interact physically only with a subset of the population, which we call contact neighbors. We employ the formalism of a network [147] to represent this contact structure [144] [145] [146] . Each individual is represented by a node, and the links between nodes represent the potential for an infectious interaction. To model variation in the information that individuals have about the health of others, we introduce a second network where individuals are connected if they are informed about each other's state. (The transmission of information could be through any mechanism: e.g. through direct conversation, word of mouth, observation of symptoms, mass-media reporting, or social media.) The information neighborhood can be (1) a subset of the contact network, (2) exactly equal to it, or (3) a superset (see Fig. 25 ). By construction, all individuals have the same number of contact neighbors k and the same number of information neighbors k info . However, we allow for the number of contact neighbors to differ from the number of information neighbors. The key point is that, in this setting, an individual estimates the risk of infection R from the fraction of its infected information neighbors (rather than considering the global fraction of infected individuals as above). For both of these networks we consider two types of topologies: (1) a network where every node has the same predetermined number of neighbors but otherwise has a random structure, and (2) a lattice network (for description of these two types of networks see a standard network reference, e.g. Ref. [147] ). These two simple network topologies are different enough to demonstrate that the results we find are not due to specific structural features.",

To estimate the probability that vaccination will remove the disease from Figure 25 : The right information range facilitates disease eradication. Probability F that the disease is eradicated after a fixed time T , as a function of k info /N, the fraction of the total population within an individual's information neighborhood (here N = 10 4 agents). The main figure is for a lattice network while the inset shows a random network, both with a contact neighborhood of size k = 12. An individual interacts with others in her contact neighborhood (red) and sees the state of those in her information neighborhood (blue). The overlapping area is shown in violet. The information neighborhood is a subset of the contact neighborhood when k > k info , exactly the same when k = k info , and a superset when k < k info . 51 the population, we fix a time T much larger than the transient time, and count the number of simulations where j(T ) = 0. We find that this fraction F of simulations where the disease is eradicated changes systematically with k info (see Fig. 24 ). Interestingly, F exhibits a clear maximum when the information neighborhood is of an intermediate size. While initially the use of information about a growing number of neighbors facilitates eradication of the disease, as individuals average over information obtained from increasingly large regions of the system, the disease becomes decreasingly likely to die out. In the extreme case where individuals consider only the average infection level in the entire system, the system behavior is essentially the same as in the well-mixed infinite system described above. Further experiments indicate that this qualitative behavior holds across different epidemiological parameters that allow the infection to invade the population when there is no vaccination 10 , although the mechanisms driving the behavior vary [143] .",

The reason for this is that the equilibrium or representative agent approaches underlying classical rational choice analysis are not applicable [15] . The social systems investigated here are characterized by systemic instabilities. Under such conditions, the desirable system state is left sooner or later, often giving rise to cascade effects such as contagious spatio-temporal spreading. 11 As a result, the system is eventually driven out of control, despite everybody's best intentions and efforts to avoid this.",

Despite best intentions, \"more of the same\" is very unlikely to have positive effects if we do not understand why such measures have been of limited effect in the past. One of the key problems in this regard appears to be the individualcentric approach, which often systematically neglects the collective dynamics, i.e. the complex systemic interplay of individual actions and the broader social context they take place in as well as the socio-economic conditions of an individual.",

In particular, the findings discussed in our paper suggest that too strict control attempts may actually cause a loss of control in a complex system. The reason is that strong control may not only be expensive, but also ineffective, as it tends to undermine the natural capability of complex systems to self-organize. 13 To control a complex system, a \"long leash\", i.e. allowing for some flexibility (\"freedom\") often works better than a \"short leash\". 14 The best approach is to use the principle of \"guided self-organization\" [15, 150] , i.e. to interfere with the system in a minimally invasive way, such that the system would self-organize and do by itself what we want it to do. In this context, it is worth reminding the reader of the \"minimally invasive\" principle of \"chaos control\", which just pushes the system slightly at the right moment, to let it take a particular path [151] . Planning and control approaches mostly work well for stationary systems, while complex systems with a largely variable and hardly predictable dynamics call for enough autonomy that allows them to flexibly adapt to the respective local requirements [152] . In other words: managing complexity requires a decentralized adaptation rather than a centralized control. Nevertheless, it is possible (and even necessary) to enable the self-organization of a complex system [153] . Suitable institutional settings such as proper organizational frameworks for mass events, can support systems in their self-organization and self-regulation, thereby reducing the need for interference. This basically means to replace or complement the classical concept of planning and top down control by the concept of empowerment, i.e. to create opportunities to take desirable decisions rather than to enforce a particular way of reaching a goal [154, 155] . In fact, to be manageable, complex systems must be designed in special ways and the interactions and institutional framework must fit each other well to enable favorable self-organization.",
