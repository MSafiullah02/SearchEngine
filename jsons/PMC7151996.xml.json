Microscopic hematuria and non-nephrotic proteinuria are present in association with deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3. Serum complement may be transiently decreased. Diffuse proliferative GN is also acute and self-limited if the infection is eradicated. IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits are prominent in the mesangium and glomerular capillaries, and electron-dense deposits are present in mesangial, subendothelial, and subepithelial locations. The immune complexes deposited in the glomeruli may or may not contain bacterial antigens, and cryoglobulins may be present. Staphylococcal infections, particularly methicillin resistant, may induce diffuse proliferative GN, likely resulting from bacterial wall superantigens that induce a nonspecific polyclonal immunoglobulin response, with crescent formation and exclusive or predominant IgA deposition. The clinical presentation is the acute nephritic syndrome. Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) is commonly observed with chronic infections. The clinical presentation is usually the nephrotic syndrome with microscopic hematuria and variable degrees of hypertension. Immunoglobulins and C3 deposits are present. In the setting of liver disease (as in Schistosoma mansoni infection), IgA may be a predominant component of the immune deposits. Membranous nephropathy (MN) is associated with chronic infections and presents as the nephrotic syndrome. Finally, vasculitis may develop in association with viral (especially hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus) or bacterial (rarely Streptococcus) infections.",

Traditionally, only certain nephritogenic strains of group A Streptococcus pyogenes result in GN. In the tropics and southern United States, PSGN usually follows streptococcal impetigo of M types 47, 49, 55, and 57. Throat infections with streptococcus types 1, 2, 4, and 12 are also nephritogenic.3, 4 More recently, ingestion of unpasteurized milk contaminated with group C streptococcus (Streptococcus zooepidemicus) has caused clusters of cases and at least one large epidemic.5 The risk of nephritis in epidemics may range from 5% in throat infections to as high as 25% in M type 49 pyoderma. A genetic predisposition is suggested as there is an association of PSGN with HLA-DR4 and DR1 and higher attack rates in siblings than expected for the general population. The risk of PSGN is reduced by early antibiotic treatment.",

GAPDH has been localized in areas of the glomeruli with plasmin-like activity, suggesting a local direct mechanism of glomerular inflammatory damage, but it is not co-localized with complement or immunoglobulin.8 In contrast, SPEB is co-localized with both complement and IgG, suggesting a participation in the immune-mediated glomerular damage.9 Furthermore, SPEB is the only putative streptococcal nephritogenic antigen that so far has been demonstrated in the subepithelial electron-dense deposits known as humps (Fig. 55.3\n), the most typical histologic lesion of acute PSGN. In studies from Latin America and central Europe, SPEB but not GAPDH is usually detectable in renal biopsy specimens of PSGN patients.9 In contrast, GAPDH was present in PSGN in a study of Japanese patients.6 These contrasting results raise the interesting possibility that different streptococcal antigens are capable of inducing acute nephritis in different ethnic groups. Indeed, a study of the group C S. zooepidemicus strain that caused the epidemic outbreak in Brazil revealed an absence of the gene related to SPEB, which documents that this antigen was not involved in that epidemic.10\n",

Subepithelial immune deposits (humps) develop because of the presence of cationic antigens (e.g., SPEB) or the dissociation of immune complexes in the subendothelial space with transit and re-formation on the outer aspect of the glomerular basement membrane. Cell-mediated immunity is supported by the presence of CD4 (helper) T lymphocytes. Cytokines also contribute to the local inflammation and injury. Urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 correlates with the severity of proteinuria in the acute phase of PSGN.",

For example, immune complex disease generally results in activation of the classical complement pathway, yet in most cases, C4 levels are normal and only C3 is found in the deposits. This could be explained by the presence of antigens (such as GAPDH) that activate the alternative pathway. In some patients, C3Nef IgG antibodies have been demonstrated in sera that are capable of activating the alternative complement pathway. Activation of the lectin complement pathway by bacterial antigens has been postulated (see Chapter 16), but individuals genetically unable to activate this pathway may still develop PSGN.",

Anti-IgG reactivity may result from the loss of sialic acid from autologous IgG due to streptococcal neuraminidase (sialidase) or from binding of the Fc fragment of IgG to type II Fc receptors in the streptococcal wall.4 Additional manifestations of autoimmune reactivity include the anti-C1q antibodies, particularly in severe cases, and rarely anti-DNA reactivity, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.4\n",

The garland pattern is clinically relevant because it is associated with heavy proteinuria and a large number of electron-dense subepithelial immune deposits.

The disease typically affects children, usually 4 to 8 years old, and only rarely adults. It presents with heavy proteinuria and overt nephrotic syndrome, late-onset hypertension, and progressive kidney insufficiency. Despite the severe hypoproteinemia, the blood cholesterol level is often normal, presumably because of associated nutritional deficiency. Renal biopsy shows MPGN with intramembranous lacunae (due to reabsorption of immune complexes). Immunofluorescence shows coarsely granular IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits, and electron microscopy displays subendothelial electron-dense deposits (Fig. 55.9\n).
