The potential for these aircraft passengers to transport infectious diseases to non\u2010infected areas is a serious public health concern, as demonstrated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that originated in 2002 and rapidly spread into 25 countries on five continents, resulting in over 8000 cases and 774 fatalities (Peiris et al., 2003). The potential for intercontinental spread of infectious bacteria via passenger aircraft also exists, particularly for newly emerging strains such as multiple\u2010drug\u2010resistant tuberculosis (Udwadia et al., 2012; Velayati et al., 2009). While reports of bacterial transmissions during air travel are infrequent, rare instances of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Neisseria meningitidis transmission within aircraft have been observed (Abubakar, 2010; Kenyon et al., 1996; Rachael et al., 2009; Wang, 2000). Deliberate infection of aircraft passengers with bacterial pathogens is also a threat (National Research Council, 2006). One measure that could mitigate infectious disease spread is rapid detection of pathogens in aircraft air prior to deplaning.",

On the basis of 2009 flight statistics, a biosensor that could be deployed in commercial aircraft arriving into the United States would require a probability of false alarm of under 10\u22126, less than approximately one false alarm per year as calculated in the studies by Hwang et al. (2011). As such, a critical obstacle in deploying rapid onboard biosensors is to minimize false alarms that may be generated by diverse microbes in circulated air in aircraft, making the understanding of microbial background critical for biosensor design.",

            "text": "To date, several studies have assessed bacteria species present in air from aircraft (Dechow et al., 1997; La Duc et al., 2006, 2007; McKernan et al., 2008; Osman et al., 2008; Wick and Irvine, 1995). Collectively, these studies conclude that humans and their belongings are a major source of airborne microorganisms in aircraft cabins. However, these prior studies are likely to have identified only a small fraction of the bacterial diversity present in aircraft cabins for a few reasons. First, previous studies of aircraft air employed culture methods (Dechow et al., 1997; McKernan et al., 2008; Osman et al., 2008; Wick and Irvine, 1995) and/or cloning of 16S rRNA gene sequences (La Duc et al., 2007; Osman et al., 2008). Results from culture methods reveal only a small fraction of the total microbial reservoir (Osman et al., 2008), especially for aerosolized Gram\u2010negative bacteria (Heidelberg et al., 1997). The effectiveness of culture methods is likely to be further reduced in the aircraft environment because of drying caused by the low relative humidity (<20%) and the rapid air exchange rate (of \u223c0.5 Kg per min per cabin occupant). In addition, prior studies used grab samples that provided limited sampling, with short sampling duration (usually 3 min or less) and discrete sampling strategies (Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology (BEST) (2002). La Duc et al. (2007) and Osman et al. (2008) in their studies pooled samples, creating composite samples of up to 10 m3 of air.",

            "text": "One way to accomplish the more comprehensive, integrated sampling is by collecting air samples via HEPA ventilation filters used in the air\u2010handling systems onboard aircraft. HEPA filters are advantageous because they are expected to capture at least 99.9% of bacteria (Bull, 2008), are aboard aircraft for months, and may collect particles from on the order of 107 m3 of air during their typical 5000\u2010h use. Even though only a small extract of filter media may be used for analysis, the amount of air sampled is large. On the order of 70 m3 of air may flow through each square centimeter of media over the life of a typical HEPA recirculation filter. From ventilation filter material, DNA and RNA can be extracted to identify microbes present (Goyal et al., 2011; Korves et al., 2011; Noris et al., 2011). Molecular methods relying only on extracted DNA have been used extensively in many environments to obtain a comprehensive picture of the microbial community, including indoor air environments (Rintala et al., 2008; Tringe et al., 2008). One molecular method for sampling environments that is relatively fast and inexpensive is the use of DNA microarrays (Brodie et al., 2007; DeSantis et al., 2007). DNA microarrays make use of short oligonucleotides probe sequences adhered to glass surfaces to assay the gene sequences present in a sample. A microarray with probes for 16S rRNA gene sequences (used for bacterial classification), called the PhyloChip, has been used to analyze microbial communities in outdoor air (Brodie et al., 2007) and many other environments (Kelly et al., 2010; Sunagawa et al., 2009; Tsiamis et al., 2008; Weinert et al., 2011; Yergeau et al., 2008). The PhyloChip has been shown to expand the breadth of coverage of microbial diversity compared to both culture methods and cloning (DeSantis et al., 2007).",

These 61 filters came from aircraft with intercontinental and North American routes and were collected during 2008 and 2009 (Table 1). Service hours for 30 filters were between 500 and 15 190 h. Service hours for the remaining 31 filters were not recorded, but filter removal times during standard maintenance are expected to vary from 6 to 18 months. Information about aircraft types or cities within the route types cannot be disclosed in compliance with non\u2010disclosure agreements. Typically, continuous removal of aircraft air occurs through cabin vents at the floor level on the side walls, which run along the entire length of the cabin (some airframes may exhaust air through the ceiling). Up to 55% of the exhausted cabin air is recirculated back into the cabin after it permeates the HEPA filter, while the rest of the exhausted cabin air is released out of the aircraft through outflow valve(s) (Hunt and Space, 1994).",

OTU were grouped into 3297 subfamilies; subfamilies can consist of more than one genus. Details of probe selection and chip design are presented elsewhere (Brodie et al., 2006, 2007; DeSantis et al., 2007).

For filter and reagent blank samples, as much as 40 \u03bcl concentrated product were used for PhyloChip analysis for two reasons: (i) to optimize the chance of detecting amplicons at very low concentrations and (ii) to load volumes of blank samples similar to actual samples. Ordinarily, reagent blanks are run only on a PhyloChip if visible bands are observed when loading 5 \u03bcl PCR product on a gel from a test PCR (single annealing temperature). However, for the aircraft dataset, several reagent blanks that did not produce visible bands were amplified using gradient PCR and run on the PhyloChip to assess reagent background. Application of PCR product followed previously described procedures (Brodie et al., 2006, 2007; DeSantis et al., 2007), including the use of the same internal standard (spike) mix used to provide similarly scaled data for all samples being compared; see Supplemental Data S1 for a brief description.",

Details of how probe intensities are used in PhyCA to generate information about each sample are included in the Supplementary Materials of the study by Hazen et al. (2010). Briefly, probe sets consisting of pairs of perfect and mismatch probes were used to distinguish real signals from background. PhyCA uses a two\u2010step process to first select a group of OTU with positive signals (Stage 1) and then to test those signals for cross\u2010hybridization potential (Stage 2). Probes with greater cross\u2010hybridization potential between neighboring OTU are more heavily penalized, reducing their contribution to the final output. The criteria used for Stage 1 and Stage 2 analysis for the G2 chips were Stage 1: rQ1 \u2265 0.379, rQ2 \u2265 0.565, rQ3 \u2265 0.82, pf \u2265 0.93, mean_without_hi_lo \u2265 500; Stage 2: r\nxQ3 \u2265 0.515 (pf is defined in the Supplemental Data S1).

Intensity ranks were used instead of the original MFI values to facilitate comparisons between aircraft and outdoor air samples; the magnitude of fluorescence intensity values could not be compared directly because outdoor and aircraft air samples were collected with different methods and had different amounts of PCR product loaded onto chips. Furthermore, total richness estimates could not be compared directly because greater PCR loading could result in a greater pool from which to draw representatives, potentially affecting the breadth of taxa detected. To assess the relative abundance of subfamilies, the OTU that ranked the highest based on intensity was used to represent the subfamily.

PhyloChip 16S rRNA gene sequence data cannot differentiate pathogens from their close, less pathogenic relatives. Even if the pathogens were present, they may not have been viable; DNA results do not distinguish infectious from non\u2010infectious particles. The results indicate that some lineages that contain pathogens, as well as close non\u2010 or weakly\u2010pathogenic relatives, were prevalent; the pathogens in these lineages include B. anthracis and B. cereus, gastrointestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica, pneumonia, ear infection, and meningitis\u2010causing Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the opportunistic nosocomial pathogen A. baumannii. The detection of most of these pathogen\u2010containing lineages is not surprising, given that they contain common human commensals (S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae) or are a common cause of disease (S. pneumoniae). Some pathogen\u2010related lineages were also identified in previous studies of aircraft air, including Burkholderia cepacia, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Neisseria meningitidis, and Mycobacterium species as well as opportunistic pathogens that affect immunocompromised persons (La Duc et al., 2007; Osman et al., 2008). The incidence of some pathogen\u2010containing OTU differed between the aircraft and outdoor air samples. In particular, the greater incidence of OTU containing B. anthracis and S. pneumoniae in aircraft parallels the association of human\u2010associated Firmicutes with aircraft and other indoor air.",

It is possible that in some cases, trace amounts of some pathogens could have been present and responsible for OTU detections. If trace amounts of some pathogens are present, then biosensor probes cannot merely detect presence or absence, but must take abundance, binding affinity, and/or viability into account. Other data, such as PCR tests for diagnostic (pathogenicity) genes, will be needed to evaluate the trace presence of pathogens. It is also important to note that even for bacterial taxa with similar 16S rRNA gene sequences in aircraft and outdoor air, there may be important differences in the bacterial genomes, including differences in the incidence of virulence factors and epitopes.",

Molecular analyses of aircraft HEPA filters could also be used after an outbreak has occurred to investigate the source of the infectious organism; a similar use has recently been proposed for building ventilation filters (Ackelsberg et al., 2011). For biosensor development, characterizing background is critical for creating sensors with low false alarm rates. Further characterization of genetic background of aircraft and airport samples could be done using next\u2010generation sequencing techniques, and comparisons could be made to other indoor environments as more data becomes available (e.g., from the microBEnet project, http://www.microbe.net/). Identifying DNA sequences and other molecular targets specific to pathogens are among the many great challenges for biosensor research in the future.",
