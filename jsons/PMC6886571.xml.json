Routine immunization of recruits resulted in ~50\u201360% declines in overall ARI, and by the early 1970s, vaccination for adenovirus became standard.4",

The case definition for SARI is the same, but with the added requirement of overnight hospitalization, a proxy for illness severity. The ILI and SARI case definitions in the ARIC NHS are derived from those developed by the WHO,11 with the only difference being that IDCRP\u2019s definition limits symptom onset to 7 days (vs 10 days in the WHO definition) prior to clinical presentation to improve the likelihood of pathogen detection using polymerase-chain reaction (PCR)-based assays.",

A standardized method could also serve as an overall measure of influenza severity. Therefore, in collaboration with NIAID and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we developed the InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) daily diary to act as a standardized, measure scale of patient influenza symptoms to evaluate the occurrence, severity, and duration of influenza symptoms during clinical trials. Thirty-seven drafted questions14 were finalized into a 32-item measure of influenza symptoms across six body regions (e.g., nose, throat, eyes, and chest) and evaluated using a 5-point ordinal system. Use of FLU-PRO was assessed based on information from 200 ILI patients (28% hospitalized during illness) and the questionnaire scores were found to be reliable, reproducible, and valid, indicating its usefulness in clinical trials and epidemiological studies.15 Specifically, FLU-PRO may provide valuable insight into treatment efficacy and safety with greater precision and less bias than non-standardized metrics in FDA-regulated studies.",

Use of a self-administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (SNIF) was assessed in a phase IV, open-label randomized control trial involving 1077 subjects. Seroresponse between subjects who self-administered and those who had the vaccine administered by a healthcare profession did not differ. Prior to vaccine administration, there was no preference in method; however, at follow-up, 64% of subjects who self-administered expressed a preference for that method.29 Antibody response to the influenza vaccine among adults with HIV infections was also evaluated in one study and HIV-infected adults were less likely to generate a seroprotective response compared to adults without HIV infection. These findings indicate that despite receiving influenza vaccinations, adults with HIV infections may remain vulnerable to the disease.30 Furthermore, the degree to which influenza vaccinations attenuate symptoms was assessed in another study involving 155 influenza-positive patients enrolled ARIC NHS (111 vaccinated). Patients who received a vaccination were significantly less likely to experience fever >101\u00b0F or myalgias. When influenza species was considered, there was a significant reduction in symptoms among patients positive for Influenza A/H3N2 who received a vaccination; however, there was no difference in disease severity with vaccination status among patients positive for Influenza A/H1N1.31",

Vaccine effectiveness is typically estimated using the test negative design, comparing proportions of influenza vaccination among patients with and without influenza. An analysis of influenza vaccine effectiveness conducted with ARIC NHS data in 2015 showed the vaccine effectiveness was below 35%.32 The findings were consistent with those from the CDC and other sources, highlighting the poor effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine. These data also raise concerns that repeated immunization with seasonal influenza may increase susceptibility to influenza and severe illness.33 In some influenza seasons, attack rates appear to be higher for people who were vaccinated during both the current and the prior year\u2019s influenza seasons compared to individuals who had only been vaccinated during the current season. Elucidating the relationship between repeated vaccinations and protection would have important implications for influenza vaccination policy. To date, the results from epidemiological studies have been conflicting. Nevertheless, examination of 155 influenza cases in the ARIC NHS (111 vaccinated) found that upper respiratory and overall symptoms were significantly less during the first two days of illness among vaccinated individuals.31 The aim of the Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Study is to explore the impact of repeated vaccination on influenza acquisition and severity in DoD populations based on a review of electronic medical records. Specifically, the study will assess the influence of antigenic components of the vaccine and the predominant influenza strain on vaccine effectiveness. The findings will provide preliminary data for the development of more definitive studies.",

Presently, five military treatment facilities in the United States are participating in this protocol with plans to involve additional sites during the second year of the study. Enrollment will be restricted to adults (who are preparing to receive seasonal influenza vaccination at participating DoD sites.

The assessment of novel and current ARI prevention and control strategies is crucial for mitigating the threat of severe disease. Between 2011 and 2015, IDCRP participated in a NIAID-sponsored, multi-center, randomized phase 2 trial assessing the safety and efficacy of anti-influenza plasma in the treatment of severe influenza.36 When patients who received plasma plus standard care were compared to those who only received standard care, there was a non-significant reduction in length of hospitalization (median of 6 days versus 11; p = 0.13). In addition, patients who received plasma had less serious adverse effects (20% vs 38%; p = 0.041). Overall, there was no significant impact on the time to normalization of the patient\u2019s respiratory status with use of plasma; however, use of plasma was safe and well-tolerated by the patients and demonstrated the potential to improve outcomes with severe influenza.36 Building on these findings, enrollment in a Phase 3 trial has been completed and data analysis is ongoing.",
