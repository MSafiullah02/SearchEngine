Functional communication is defined as a behavior that is directed to another person who in turn provides either direct or social rewards. Nine critical communication skills will be described. These skills are critical because, if children cannot calmly and effectively engage in each skill, then they will most likely try other means to obtain the same outcome. Typically, these other means are challenging\u2014crying, fussing, shouting, hitting, and so on. We have identified nine such skills, of which some are skills to be used as a speaker and some are to be used as a listener, as outlined in Table 1.",

            "text": "It also is recommended to distinguish what a child likes or prefers from what a child needs when assessing motivating items and activities. For example, Mary enjoys eating vanilla pudding but does so only with a spoon, never with her fingers. It is fair to say that she likes pudding, but it would be unusual to declare that she likes spoons. Mary does not have a collection of spoons, and when asked to name things she likes or enjoys, she never mentions spoons. Therefore, parents are advised to list both things their children like and things they may need within a context. Furthermore, many traditional approaches to preference assessment attempt to compare individually offered items for the purpose of ranking them within a hierarchy. Although it may be true that a child prefers a ball in comparison to a napkin, this strategy places too much emphasis on individually presented rewards as opposed to combinations. Simply put, imagine how most children would respond if asked, \u201cDo you want peanut butter or jelly?\u201d Adults rarely simply order coffee from a barista. Therefore, parents are advised to investigate combinations of items or activities in order to enhance their effectiveness: cookies and milk, french fries and ketchup, music and dancing, and so on.Problem: Three-year-old Derek wants to play his favorite game, but his father has put the iPad on the top shelf above the television where Derek cannot reach it.

He has learned to set the track up on his own; connect the train engine, cars, and caboose; and put the train on the track and start the train. Today when the train rounds the first corner, it falls off the track. Joey tries several times to restart the train but does not notice that the track is not properly connected at the first corner. After several attempts to get the train going, each time ending with a derailed train, Joey screams and throws the train across the room.Potential solution: Re-create the situation by intentionally misaligning part of the track. Before Joey gets upset, teach him to bring the train to his sister and gesture for help. Over time, create other more challenging problems for Joey to encounter.Problem: Amanda is working on her math homework at the kitchen table along with her brother.

During the early afternoon, Sue begins asking her parents when the food will arrive, and they answer, \u201cNot for several hours,\u201d \u201cLater,\u201d or \u201cAt 6:00.\u201d Sue does not know how to tell time and continues to ask every 15 or 20 min, which begins to annoy her parents.

They give Marshall an index card with five open circles and tell him that he will earn a token each time he calmly responds when they say no.

For example, when Mom shouts to her son, \u201cDon\u2019t walk in front of the swings!\u201d failure to respond could result in injury. It is important to first teach children to respond to directions that will produce meaningful and desired outcomes from the children\u2019s point of view.Problem: Angela\u2019s parents report that Angela sometimes looks toward them when they call her name. If she is engaged in a favorite activity, however, she does not respond when they say, \u201cCome here.\u201d She seems to follow directions some of the time, but not always. For example, yesterday when her father told her to put her shoes away, she did not do so. But this morning, as he was getting on his coat so they could go to the park, he told Angela to get her shoes, and she ran right to them.Potential solution: Angela\u2019s parents can teach her to listen for her name paired with \u201ccome here\u201d by rewarding her with favorite items (e.g., toys, snacks) for coming over.",

Asking for a ball yields the ball, whereas saying \u201cthat\u2019s a ball\u201d leads to praise. This analysis should extend to following directions. \u201cGet the ball\u201d leads to the ball, whereas \u201cpoint to the ball\u201d leads to praise. It is suggested that directions at home should initially result in a child receiving items and activities in a direct fashion before lessons that only lead to social outcomes are introduced. Just as children must eventually learn to request and comment, so too should children learn to respond to what others are communicating about for both types of outcomes.",

If a child can read, then using words may be helpful, but children with ASD can learn to use pictures or other three-dimensional items to keep track of their schedules. When pictures are used within a schedule, it is a good idea to first teach what the pictures mean (i.e., what to do when one sees a picture) and only then teach the child how to use the schedule itself. Teach one lesson at a time, and avoid mixing them together. The pictures used should refer to important objects, activities, or areas of the home or neighborhood. The child should respond to the picture without someone telling him or her what the picture means\u2014otherwise, why use the pictures? For example, when shown a picture of a spoon, the child should get the spoon and go to the area or start the activity shown without someone saying, \u201cRight! Get the spoon!\u201d",

Mary throws a tantrum while screaming, \u201cNow! Now!\u201dPotential solution: Mary\u2019s mother introduces a visual schedule of the important activities of the day.

Initially, they make sure the surprise is something that David enjoys, such as time on the computer. Later, these good surprises are intermixed with surprise activities that David feels neutral about. Finally, his parents intersperse some surprises concerning things that David does not enjoy.

            "text": "Everyone must deal with transitions\u2014between locations, activities, and from person to person. The use of a schedule can help a child cope with what is going to happen at different times of the day. However, some children respond to transitions as if their lives were being turned upside down! Although improving information about the upcoming event may reduce the magnitude of the ensuing tantrum, providing more information (even visually based) is not always sufficient. Some transitions involve changes from activities that are highly rewarding to those that are less rewarding\u2014and no one looks forward to leaving pleasant activities. Some children become upset even when they are asked to change from a less rewarding activity to one that is more rewarding. This reaction may be because the transition involves both leaving something behind and changing to a new activity. Many children respond better when provided with information about the next reward rather than information about the next activity. When the next activity is not inherently rewarding, then adding a separate reinforcer may be necessary.Problem: MaryJane has just finished her breakfast and is coloring on a sheet of paper in the kitchen. Her mother tells her that it is time to play in the family room. MaryJane throws the crayons on the floor and screams while her mother physically guides her to the family room. Within a few minutes, MaryJane is calm once more and contentedly playing with her toys. Then her mother tells her that it is time to water the plants\u2014something that MaryJane usually enjoys. MaryJane screams and throws the toys around while her mother coaxes her to get the watering can. This pattern cycles many times each day.Potential solution: MaryJane\u2019s mother shows MaryJane what her reward will be for making a transition before asking her to change activities. For example, while MaryJane is coloring, her mother brings her one of her favorite toys from the family room. She shows the toy to her daughter, who immediately reaches for it. Then her mother says, \u201cLet\u2019s play with the toys in the family room . . . but first we need to put away the crayons.\u201d MaryJane puts away the crayons and runs to play with the toy. Later, while MaryJane is still playing with the toy, her mother shows her a picture of the watering can. While she is looking at the picture, her mother says, \u201cLet\u2019s go water the plants . . . but first we need to clean up the toys.\u201d Throughout the day, MaryJane\u2019s mother shows her the next available reward before indicating that MaryJane needs to stop what she is currently doing.",
