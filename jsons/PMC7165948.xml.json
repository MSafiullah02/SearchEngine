This primary sensory system contributes significantly to the quality of life, allowing for the full appreciation of flowers, perfumes, spices, and a vast array of foods and beverages, as well as the seashore, the mountains, and the seasons of the year. Thus, it is no wonder that losses or distortions of smell sensation are of considerable significance to patients, particularly those dependent on this sense for their livelihood or safety (e.g., cooks, homemakers, plumbers, firefighters, perfumers, fragrance sales persons, wine merchants, food and beverage distributors, and employees of numerous chemical, gas, and public works industries).

CN I mediates odor sensations (e.g., chocolate, strawberry and apple), whereas CN V mediates, through both chemical and nonchemical stimuli, somatosensory sensations, including those of burning, cooling, irritation, and tickling. The coolness of menthol and peppermint are mediated by CN V, as, for example, are the sharp sensations induced by ammonia vapors and various acids. The function of CN O, a ganglionated neural plexus that spans much of the nasal mucosa before traversing the cribriform plate to enter the forebrain medial to the olfactory tract, is unknown in humans. This nerve, whose disruption in some rodents alters reproductive behavior, \n1\n was discovered after the other cranial nerves had been named and is highly conserved among the vertebrates, including humans. \n2\n, \n3\n\n",

            "text": "On the basis of morphological and biochemical criteria, the mature olfactory epithelium comprises at least six distinct cell types (Fig. 1). \n6\n The first, the bipolar sensory receptor neuron, is estimated to number approximately 6,000,000 cells in the adult, exceeding the number of receptor cells in any other sensory system except vision. The olfactory receptors are located on the ciliated dendritic ends of these cells, whose surface area probably exceeds 22 cm2 in the human. The receptor cell axons coalesce into &sim;40 bundles (termed the olfactory fila), which are ensheathed by Schwann\u2010like cells. The fila traverse the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to enter the anterior cranial fossa and collectively constitute CN I. The second cell type, positioned near the surface of the epithelium, is the microvillar cell. These cells are said to number approximately 600,000 in the adult. Each microvillar cell, whose function is unknown, contains microvilli. The third cell type, the supporting or sustentacular cell, also projects microvilli into the mucus. These cells are believed to 1) insulate the receptor cells from one another, 2) regulate the local ionic composition of the mucus, 3) deactivate odorants, and 4) help protect the epithelium from damage from foreign agents. The supporting cells contain xenobiotic\u2010metabolizing enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P\u2010450), a feature shared with the fourth cell type, the cell that lines the Bowman glands and ducts. The Bowman glands are a major source of mucus within the region of the olfactory epithelium. The fifth and six cell types are the globose (light) basal cell and horizontal (dark) basal cell, cells that are located near the basement membrane from which the other cell types arise. The same type of basal cell, probably a globose cell, can give rise to both neurons and nonneural cells when the olfactory epithelium is damaged, expressing a multiple potency rarely observed in stem cells. It is noteworthy that the olfactory ensheathing cells, which form the bundles of axons that make up the olfactory fila, enhance remyelination and axonal conduction in demyelinated spinal tract nerves, as well as in severed rat sciatic nerves, \n7\n exhibiting both Schwann cell\u2013like and astrocyte\u2010like properties.",

In the human, the receptor cell axons of the olfactory fila, after traversing the cribriform plate, form the olfactory nerve layer and synapse in the second bulbar layer within the spherical glomeruli. In general, receptor neurons expressing a given receptor type project to one or, at most, two glomeruli, making the glomeruli in effect functional units. Thus, a given odorant activates a spatially defined or restricted set of glomeruli. Hence, the olfactory code is reflected, at this early stage, not only as different patterns across the mucosa, but across the glomeruli as well.",

In modern olfactory detection threshold testing, the subject is asked to report which of two or more stimuli (i.e., an odorant and one or more blanks) smells strongest, rather than to simply report whether or not an odor is perceived.

In addition, they are more reliable and produce lower threshold values. \n8\n The instructions provided to a subject are critical in measuring a detection threshold because, if the subject is instructed to report which stimulus produces an odor rather than which stimulus is stronger, a spuriously high threshold value may result because the subject's attention is diverted away from subtle differences in the presented stimuli (odor quality is present only at higher perithreshold concentrations).",

In addition to indicating the level of absolute smell function (i.e., normosmia, mild hyposmia, moderate hyposmia, severe hyposmia, total anosmia), this test provides a percentile rank for each age and gender group.

Nasal volume was assessed by acoustic rhinometry. Thirty\u2010six subjects (18 women, 18 men) were evaluated soon after they experienced the natural onset of a cold. After rhinitis onset (day 0), sensory and airway measurements were obtained on days 2, 4, 6, and 35. The cold produced a decrease in the volume of the anterior nasal cavity and an increase in mucus secretion, an increase in olfactory thresholds, a decrease in intensity ratings, and a decrease in N1 evoked potential amplitudes to both olfactory and trigeminal stimuli. When mucus secretion of the contralateral nasal cavity was controlled with oxymetazoline, N1 amplitudes to olfactory stimuli were still affected by the cold, as indicated by the significant increase of amplitudes as subjects recovered; however, this phenomenon was not found for any of the other test measures or for the responses to the trigeminal stimuli.

Some such studies have differentiated between rhinitis and secondary nasal and sinus disease (i.e., sinusitis and/or polyposis), although this distinction is often difficult to maintain. Currently, the term rhinosinusitis is preferable to the term sinusitis because invariably inflammation of the sinuses coexists with inflammation of the nose. Rhinosinusitis can be further divided into acute, subacute, recurrent acute, and chronic types, during which acute exacerbation of chronic symptoms can occur.

Hotchkiss evaluated self\u2010reported olfactory function in 30 patients with nasal obstruction secondary to polyposis who reported smell loss. All were treated with a total dose of 70 mg of prednisone over a 6\u2010day period. Restoration of smell was said to follow the systemic steroid therapy, with the magnitude of the restoration being proportional to the amount of polyp shrinkage. The restoration was reportedly unrelated to the duration of the loss of olfactory function. However, the self\u2010rated improvement lasted only (on average) 10 days after the discontinuation of therapy. Fein et al. examined 18 patients who reported loss of smell associated with allergic rhinitis. Of these patients, 14 had other diseases, including sinusitis, polyposis, and bronchial asthma. Again, no objective sensory testing was performed. On the basis of self\u2010report, the severity of the smell dysfunction was classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Of the four patients who had only allergic rhinitis, two were said to have had mild smell loss, and two, moderate smell loss. Of the 14 patients with other diseases, two reportedly had mild loss, six moderate loss, and six severe loss. In the latter group, severe loss was said to be associated with the presence of both polyposis and sinusitis. Although improvement in some of the subjects from hyposensitization, antibiotics, polypectomy, or various combinations of treatments was noted, a lack of a well\u2010defined experimental protocol employing quantitative olfactory tests and the introduction of the treatments in various combinations without control for their order or time precludes a determination of the relative efficacy of the interventions.",

At the transduction level, the discovery of the gene family that controls the expression of olfactory receptors has been a monumental event. At the measurement level the development and proliferation of practical and reliable olfactory tests has spawned hundreds of studies that otherwise would not have been made, demonstrating olfactory dysfunction in a wide range of clinical disorders and leading to the discovery that olfactory loss is a very early clinical sign of several major neurodegenerative diseases. The comparatively few studies that have employed modern psychophysical tests to patients with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis have generally found an association between the degree of smell loss and the severity of nasal disease, although, except in cases of marked obstruction, no relationship is apparent between airway patency and olfactory dysfunction. This observation, along with recent histopathological studies of the olfactory mucosa in these disorders and the fact that even after nasal surgery and corticosteroid treatments, smell function rarely returns, on average, to normal levels, suggests that airflow access is not the only factor determining smell loss in such patients. Although the weight of the evidence suggests that nasal steroid sprays, when appropriately administered, can improve olfactory function in some patients, not a single double\u2010blind study employing placebos has evaluated the efficacy of such procedures in restoring smell function. It is hoped that the widespread availability of easy\u2010to\u2010use tests of olfactory function will lead to such controlled studies in the not\u2010too\u2010distant future.",
