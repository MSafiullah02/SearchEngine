            "text": "Swine influenza is an acute respiratory tract infection in pigs, characterized by high fever, depression, loss of appetite, tachypnoea, dyspnea and coughing. At the microscopic level, the infection induces interstitial pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Pathogens causing swine flu are type A influenza viruses. Three swine influenza virus (SIV) subtypes, i.e. H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2, are circulating among pigs worldwide, whereas lineages may vary within each subtype depending on the region, i.e. North America, Europe and Asia. The disease is highly contagious. The morbidity can be high (near 100%) but the mortality rate is usually low (less than 1%) (Olsen et al., 2006). A flu outbreak has an important economic impact particularly because of the medications costs and the growth rate decrease (Bardini et al., 2011, Brons et al., 2011). These financial losses vary depending on the severity of the disease, which is influenced by many factors: the virus strain, the age and immune status of the infected pig, the presence of concurrent infections, climatic conditions, housing and infection pressure.",

PRDC is characterized by decreased rate of growth, decreased feed efficiency, anorexia, fever, cough and dyspnea. It is a multifactorial disease of pigs caused by sequential or concurrent infections with several viral or bacterial respiratory pathogens. Together with SIVs, some pathogens involved in PRDC have been identified to be Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), Porcine Circovirus type-2 (PCV-2), Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp), Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (Choi et al., 2003, Sorensen et al., 2006, Thacker, 2001). Several studies based on experimental dual infections of pigs have been conducted to understand interactions between SIVs and PRRSV, PCV-2, Mhp, PRCV or Bordetella bronchiseptica, pathogens that are frequently detected in herds (Lanza et al., 1992, Loving et al., 2010, Thacker et al., 2001, Van Reeth et al., 1996, Van Reeth et al., 2001, Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994, Wei et al., 2010, Yazawa et al., 2004). Among them, Mhp is one of the pathogens that is most commonly isolated from pigs with clinical signs of PRDC. Alone, Mhp induces chronic pneumonia with dry, non productive cough beginning 7\u201314 days after infection (Thacker, 2006). The hallmark lesions associated with Mhp are hyperplasia of the bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Experimental co-infections with Mhp and SIVs from the \u201cclassical swine H1N1\u201d lineage mostly circulating in America suggested that the dual infection results in increased overall pathogenicity as compared to outcomes of individual infections (Thacker et al., 2001, Yazawa et al., 2004).",

One pig over 5, that maintained a normal rectal temperature throughout the study, was the most affected. Its decline was characterized by vomiting, accelerated abdominal breathing and severe anorexia. Over the week post-infection with SIV, pigs from the MH1N1 group ate food in an average of 0.971 kg/day/pig, whereas pigs in the H1N1 group ate 1.297 kg/day/pig.

It has to be noted that the food consumption decrease following SIV H1N1 infection was particularly marked from 0 to 4 DPI. As a consequence, the mean weight gain (MWG) was significantly reduced in the H1N1 group, as compared to the C group, when calculated for the first 4 days period post-SIV infection (Fig. 2\n). Whereas Mhp infection alone did not affect normal weight gain, pre-infection with Mhp led H1N1-inoculated pigs to a very strong weight gain reduction, resulting in a negative MWG, i.e. a weight loss over the first 4 days post-SIV H1N1 infection.",

Thus, the MWG reduction was still significant when calculated from 0 to 7 days post-H1N2 inoculation, whereas it was not found significant after H1N1 infection over that period of time (Fig. 2). Previous infection with Mhp increased the severity of clinical signs induced by SIV H1N2, but to a lesser extent than it had on pigs infected with H1N1. Over the 7 days post-infection with SIV, pigs in MH1N2 group ate 1.051 kg of food in average against 1.302 kg in H1N2 group. However, whereas the difference in food consumption between these two groups was equivalent to that observed between MH1N1 and H1N1 groups, the weight loss was less important in MH1N2 group than in MH1N1 group.

HI antibody titer was significantly higher when animals were infected with H1N2 than with H1N1. Co-infection with Mhp impacted the serum HI response to SIV infection: HI titers were about 3 times higher for MH1N1 and MH1N2 groups than for H1N1 and H1N2 groups, respectively. Moreover, HI antibody titer was significantly greater for MH1N2 than for MH1N1.",

We have shown that both SIV subtypes were able to induce typical signs of swine influenza when inoculated intra-tracheally to na\u00efve SPF pigs, as previously proposed by others (Haesebrouck et al., 1985, Maes et al., 1984). The experimental diseases induced by the selected H1N1 and H1N2 strains globally mimicked respiratory outbreaks observed in the herds of origin, with fever, coughing, dyspnea and loss of appetite. However, a difference in the severity of clinical and pathological effects was observed depending on the strain subtype in experimental conditions, i.e. without any involvement of external factors. Thus, the H1N2 strain appeared slightly more pathogenic than the H1N1 strain: the daily weight gain per day between 0 and 7 days after SIV inoculation was lower and macroscopic pulmonary lesions were more extended, affecting the diaphragmatic lobes. H1N2 has been detected and isolated at 2 DPI SIV in nasal swabs from 5/5 inoculated animals whereas H1N1 has been detected in only 3/5 pigs at that time. This suggested that H1N2 SIV replicated faster and stronger than H1N1 SIV, leading to earlier shedding. However, at 7 DPI, SIV was still detected in 5/5 H1N1-infected pigs but in only 1/5 H1N2-infected pigs. This would imply a faster H1N2 virus elimination, possibly related to the induction of an earlier and/or more efficient immune response after H1N2 infection as compared to H1N1 infection, as revealed by higher HI titers in H1N2 group than in H1N1 group at 7 DPI. This difference in HI titers after European H1N1 versus H1N2 SIVs confirmed observations made at 2 weeks post inoculation SIV in a previous study (Van Reeth et al., 2006).",

            "text": "In 2001, Thacker et al. showed that the intra-tracheal administration of Mhp to conventional pigs 21 days before the inoculation by nebulization of a classical swine H1N1 virus led to an increase in clinical signs severity and pneumonia lesions at the macroscopic level, but no incidence was reported at the microscopic level (Thacker et al., 2001). In 2004, Yazawa et al. inoculated intranasally Mhp-infected caesarian derived and colostrums deprived pigs with classical swine H1N1 and also observed an increase in lung lesions, while the SIV was slightly pathogenic when it was inoculated singly (Yazawa et al., 2004). However, these authors showed that the expression of clinical signs may depend on the time of SIV inoculation following Mhp infection, as they were less pronounced when SIV was inoculated 7 days after Mhp, as compared to those observed when both infections were performed 21 days apart. In the present study, we confirmed that intra-tracheal inoculation of an European avian-like swine H1N1 increased clinical signs and lung lesions severity as compared to those observed after H1N1 SIV inoculation in na\u00efve pigs when inoculated 21 days after Mhp, a time where Mhp infection is well established (Marois et al., 2010). Interestingly, the most significant sign was the important weight loss over the 4 days following the H1N1 SIV inoculation, which was not determined in previous studies. There was a large variation of clinical disease between pigs in MH1N1 group. However, this individual variation was also found in other experimental studies of dual infection, as in PRRSV-SIV infection (Van Reeth et al., 1996, Van Reeth et al., 2001) but factors responsible of the variation are still unknown. Lungs were also more affected in MH1N1 group as compared to H1N1 group; lesion of pneumonia were much more extended and reached the diaphragmatic lobes. This can be correlated with the fact that H1N1 SIV was detected in diaphragmatic lobe in coinfected animals whereas it was not in singly inoculated pigs. Thus, the primary infection with Mhp seemed to impact the spread and/or persistence of the European avian-like H1N1 virus in lungs, whereas the shedding in nasal secretions was not enhanced.",

The respiratory symptoms were increased and the animal growth was slowed. The hyperplasia of bronchiolar-associated lymphoid tissue was more important and the serum HI response to H1N2 SIV infection was higher in the MH1N2 group than in H1N2 group. That could be the sign of an immune response more advanced or higher. The present data showed a difference in Mhp genome amount in diaphragmatic lung lobes of dual infected pigs, as compared to pigs only infected with Mhp. Thus, Mhp infection itself would be also influenced by the H1N2 infection.",

            "text": "Altogether, these results indicated that Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae interacted differently with H1N1 and H1N2 SIVs. In Mhp/H1N1 coinfection, synergistic effects were observed, with increased clinical signs and lung damages originating from both Mhp and H1N1 single infections. Thus, whereas H1N1 alone appeared less virulent than H1N2, the disease was more acute in MH1N1 group than in Mhp/H1N2 coinfected animals: the mean weight gain was more reduced, lesions of pneumonia were more extensive and microscopic lung lesions were more severe. These observations are typical of PRDC symptoms on field. By contrast, there were not apparent synergistic effects between the pathogens in Mhp/H1N2 coinfection, but rather the opposite, e.g. concurrent effect. The induction of immune response seemed earlier or more effective in MH1N2 group than in MH1N1. This could be linked to the difference also observed between responses that follow H1N2 and H1N1 single infections, respectively. Thus, it can be hypothesize that immune responses launched by H1N2 infection could play a role in the elimination of Mhp in the lung. The association between SIVs and Mhp are common in herds, even among healthy pigs that had no clinical symptoms (Palzer et al., 2008). The timing between the two infections but also the identity of the virus strain seems to have an important responsibility in the induction of clinical signs. All these results are in accordance with data we obtained from an epidemiological survey conducted in 125 herds affected by respiratory disorders, that showed a significant association between Mhp and H1N1, but not Mhp and H1N2, for the induction of enzootic pneumonia (Fablet et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Mechanisms responsible for the increased severity of clinical disease in case of dual infection are not clear and would require further investigations. It appears that cytokines produced locally at the site of infection have an important role in the development of the respiratory disease (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2011). The pneumonia induced by Mhp is associated with a production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 or TNF-\u03b1 from 7 days to 28 days post inoculation (Redondo et al., 2009). The SIV infection also induces the production of IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1, with a peak level at 1 day post-infection with SIV, what coincides with the onset of influenza symptoms and lung pathological changes (Barbe et al., 2011, Jo et al., 2007, Van Reeth et al., 1999). It can be hypothesized that an excessive and concurrent production of IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 in the lung would lead to significant tissue damages. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate the modulations of cytokines and chemokines in Mhp/H1N1 and Mhp/H1N2 co-infected animals in order to better understand and compare these pathogen interactions. Another major contributor to the development of an increased pathology in dual infection is the fact that Mhp and SIV target both the epithelial cells and thereby cause damage to the mucociliary clearance mechanisms, which play an important role in pulmonary defense.",

In addition, this experimental animal model could be useful for understanding mechanisms causing severe pneumonia in humans. Indeed, clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of influenza infections in pigs, which are physiologically, anatomically and immunologically similar to humans, closely resemble those observed in humans. In human, bacterial pneumonia after flu infection is often observed and a large majority of influenza complications or deaths results from secondary bacterial infection (Centers for Disease and Prevention, 2009, Morens et al., 2008).",
