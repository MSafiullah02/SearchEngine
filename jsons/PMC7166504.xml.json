To remove collagen and other large debris, the homogenate was filtered through a Steriflip vacuum\u2010driven system (Millipore Corp, Bellierica, CA) and the filter washed with TBS to yield \u223c7.7e7 CE/ml. A starting reference aliquot of the filtered homogenate was frozen for analytic and infectivity titrations (Fx0). Separation of nuclei from cytosol and myelin\u2010membranes was facilitated by adjusting the filtrate to 25% sucrose followed by centrifugation at 5,500g \u00d7 10 min in a Beckman HS\u20104 rotor at 20\u00b0C. The small nuclear pellet was strongly DAPI positive for DNA, and the thick floating white membrane\u2010lipid fraction showed only a weak DAPI fluorescence. The non\u2010fluorescent cytosol (Fx1) was collected by syringe, adjusted to 8% sucrose with TBS, and centrifuged at 10,000g \u00d7 5 min at 22\u00b0C to clear residual membrane and nuclear contamination. This yielded a highly infectious 10 k supernatant (s10). The release of 90% of the starting FU\u2010CJD brain infectivity into Fx1 cytosol was achieved without any detergents, making it possible to study the effect of later added detergents and enzymes such as Triton X\u2010100 (final concentration of 0.1%) and RNAse, as done here. The same method was used to make p18 particles from control and sCJD cerebral cortex; the latter was from a 67\u2010year\u2010old male with typical clinical and pathologic sCJD and positive for PrP\u2010res by Western blot.",

The use of pooled 18 k pellets (p18), suspended by bath sonication in 20 mM Tris\u2013Cl pH 8.9, enabled increased loads on sucrose step gradients [Sun et al., 2008] for further purification. Briefly, \u223c2e7 CE/ml were loaded on gradients and spun in a TLA 55 rotor at 135,000g for 1 h at 20\u00b0C. A reduced centrifugation time (1 h vs. 2 h previously) was used to better assess changes in sedimentation after RNAse and Proteinase K (PK). PK digestions, detailed in the Results Section, were done prior to gradient loading and stopped by PMSF [Miyazawa et al., 2011a].

FU\u2010CJD infected mouse brain typically contained 0.3 TCID per cell, equivalent to 3.3e8 (3.3 \u00d7 108) TCID per gram of brain (e9 cells). Titers done on all fractions in multiple independent experiments were averaged in Table I, as were other molecular components. Western blots for specific proteins such as PrP and tubulin, and colloidal gold staining for other proteins, were done as previously [Manuelidis et al., 2009]. Extracted nucleic acids were assayed by Nanodrop reader and Sybr gold stained agarose gels loaded with 3e6 cell equivalents (CE) of purified nucleic acids [Manuelidis, 2011]; 500 pg per band were easily detected in lanes with diluted markers; this reflects a sensitivity of six orders of magnitude from starting cell DNA (250 \u03bcg per 3e6 cells).",

Moreover, agent isolation here contrasts with standard sarkosyl procedures to \u201cpurify\u201d PrP amyloid aggregates that yield only 0.1\u20135% of the starting titer [Hilmert and Diringer, 1984; Weber et al., 2008]. Nuclear contamination, poor separation of agent from myelin, lipid\u2010rich membranes, pathological debris, blood vessels, and collagen all compromised previous agent purifications. We found that: (1) filtration of homogenates removes virtually all blood vessels and collagen with no loss of starting titer; (2) addition of sucrose to 25% stabilizes nuclei and improves their separation by low speed pelleting. This high sucrose concentration also separates the majority of floating lipid\u2010rich membranes, and at the same time removes 30% of starting PrP and PrP\u2010res; (3) Omission of detergents and their impermeable micelles enhances separation of 90% of the starting brain infectivity into the cytosol without artifactual aggregation (Fx1, Fig. 1A and Table I); and (4) We also discovered that RNAse treatment facilitates concentration of essentially all infectious particles by a simple 18,000g \u00d7 30 min centrifugation. Moreover, these more purified p18 particles contain relatively low protein and nucleic acid, features necessary for detection of agent\u2010specific molecules. The method outlined (Fig. 1A) is straightforward, takes only 1 day, and a rapid sucrose step gradient further purifies infectious particles from residual proteins that are not required for infection.",

            "text": "Figure 1B shows a typical Western blot of PrP in the sequential subcellular FU\u2010CJD brain fractions. The cytosol (Fx1) contains 70% of the starting brain PrP, including abnormal PrP\u2010res. Fx1 (lane 1) is further purified by a 10 kg spin for 5 min. This pellets residual membranes and nuclei (p10, lane 2) with little loss of agent. Additional PrP (30%) is removed, while the 10 k supernatant contains the remaining 28% of total PrP (s10, lane 3). Benzonase (BZ) digestion of nucleic acids does not reduce the PrP content as shown with more purified p18 particles after BZ (lane 5) compared to its undigested p18 control (lane 6). Thus BZ should not reduce infectious titer according to the prion protein\u2010only hypothesis. In stark contrast, digestion of p18 particles with 100 \u03bcg PK for 2 h shows no visible PrP (lane 8), even though this lane contains a >3\u2010fold higher load than lanes 5\u20137. In principle, such PK digested \u201cprionless\u201d samples should lose 3 logs of infectivity in accord with a loss of 99.9% of the starting total PrP but the infectious titer was not reduced (see Fig. 2B). No background was subtracted, and the 0.1% PrP value can reflect the residual 29 kDa PK band that binds PrP antibodies. For example, 3 h digests of Fx1 with very high PK (175 \u03bcg/ml, Fig. 1C, lanes 6\u20138) show this 29 kDa PK band (arrowhead). Other proteins, subsequently stained with gold on the same blot (Fig. 1D) are also markedly reduced in the PK+ lanes (compare undigested lane 1), while the added PK at 29 kDa is the dominant band. Although, PrP is barely detectable in these 3 h PK digests, many other gold\u2010stained proteins from 15 to 75 kDa clearly survive PK digestion. Large amounts of RNAse, added after PK was stopped (Fig. 1D, lanes 5 and 8, bands at 13\u201315 kDa) are removed by concentration of p18 particles. The above data encouraged further evaluation of agent particles in sequentially purified fractions with high infectivity.",

PrP was again reduced and thus the more purified subcellular infectious fractions were pursued to further minimize the set of proteins most critical for agent structure and resistance. With progressive purification, less obvious pathologic host components that adhere most tightly to infectious particles should also be revealed. Whereas aggregating PrP can trap the infectious agent and also entangle other brain proteins, including ubiquitin and Apolipoprotein J [Manuelidis et al., 1997], only a few of these may be retained with increasing agent purification, especially after PK digestion.",

A strong PrP\u2010res response in indicator GT1 cells, as early as p3 post\u2010infection with low CE, indicates a very high titer [Miyazawa et al., 2011a,2011b]. In A, the sucrose fractions without PrP induce a vigorous PrP\u2010res response in GT1 cells (+PK lanes), and 85% of the recovered infectivity is in the 15% sucrose fraction. In blot B from the RNAse only gradient, the same total TCID are recovered, but the infectious particles rapidly pass through the 8\u201315% sucrose steps and are concentrated in the bottom 25\u201360% sucrose steps. Control uninfected brain (N\u2010CNS lane in blot B), in contrast to the FU\u2010CJD samples, induces no PrP\u2010res in this GT1 assay. The total infectivity recovered from each of the three gradients was indistinguishable and quantitative, and is graphed in Figure 2C. This result indicates a smaller TSE particle size (\u223c60\u201380S) than previously determined, but one that is still in keeping with ultrastructural \u223c25 nm diameter dense particles observed in infected cells [Manuelidis et al., 2007]. Interestingly, BZ digestion of nucleic acids had a greater effect on titer than PK. Figure 2D shows BZ at two different concentrations reduced titer by 1 log. In the past, nuclease treatment of aggregated pelleted material has not caused a loss of infectivity [Manuelidis, 2011], and the nuclease sensitivity of more purified agent particles here deserve further investigation. In sum, the current results show that proteins other than PrP are essential for TSE agent infectivity.",

We have detected several protein subtypes in p18 particles, such as nucleic acid binding proteins [Manuelidis, 2011], including their affinity to biotinylated recombinant Sphinx DNA sequences. We have also detected protein bands that bind antibodies to Sphinx ORFs (data not shown). However, because the total proteins in the p18, and especially in the PK treated p18 particles, had low protein levels, it was advantageous to use more sensitive and inclusive approaches for analysis. Whereas the high titer of FU\u2010CJD p18 particles used for MS were not reduced by PK, they lost >4 logs of infectivity with urea\u2010trypsin treatments (even without Lys C) prior to MS analysis.

However, after PK, neither sample had detectable PrP by MS, and it is possible that the marginal 29 kDa band we detected in a 20\u00d7 overloaded Western blot of this FU\u2010CJD sample (0.05% of the starting PrP) reflected other peptides that can cross react with the M20 anti\u2010PrP polyclonal antibody.

Their absence from the normal p18 does not mean that they are not present, but only that they are preferentially bound to infectious particles rather than with co\u2010sedimenting cellular proteins. PK treatment also allowed discovery of molecules that were insufficiently represented in the more complex undigested sample, and these numerous cellular proteins quantitatively differentiated by SWATH will be detailed separately. Table II lists 42 sequences with the highest identity viral scores that were not detectable in the parallel uninfected PK+ control. The remaining significant 72 peptides (scores >20) are listed in the supplement. First, it is notable that many different RNA and DNA viral groups are represented including retroviruses (HIV 1), coronaviruses, herpesviruses (goat and frog origin), plant viruses (pepper leaf and grapevine), insect and bacterial viruses. None of these viruses have ever been in our lab, and they are unlikely to be contaminants because infected and control samples without these sequences were always prepared in parallel with identical reagents. Secondly, a fair number of sequences in the NCBI viral database were identified in limited geographic locations unlikely to be in our environment, such as Antarctic lakes, China, Hungary, Brazil, and Australian seawater. Thirdly, the significant viral identities are limited to a few protein classes, most notably, ENV glycoproteins, viral replication and polymerase proteins, and capsid (nucleic acid binding) proteins. Together, the foregoing suggests these sequence motifs may function in several disparate viral classes. These peptides would never have been identified in high background samples, and were brought out by PK treatment that markedly reduced other proteins not required for infection. Among the replicase peptides, it is also notable that bacterial REP proteins, further confirmed DNA sequences of particle REP nucleic acids [Manuelidis, 2011]. Although these and other sequences on the list may not be integral agent components, they, as well as others that may be discovered in enriched particle preparations, deserve further study to determine their potential roles in infection and particle processing.",

In view of the higher protein background in these non\u2010PK treated samples, these sequences may signify particle processing and pathologic products rather than integral agent molecules. On the other hand, the human genes identified in sCJD, but not the control human p18, began to give a strong indication of relevant pathological and neuronal repair sequences that were particle associated. High on the identity list, unexpectedly, were the neural Wiskott\u2010Aldridch protein and Huntintin. In addition, expected cell proteins including vesicle, endosomal, multivesicular, and chaperone proteins that are likely to be involved in agent trafficking and processing were also obvious. Expected mitochondrial proteins were also identified, consistent with the co\u2010sedimenting mitochondrial DNA detectable by PCR in every infectious preparation to date, including those treated with nucleases [Manuelidis, 2011].

All infectious preparations, when tested by sensitive molecular methods, contain appreciable nucleic acids of viral size (>1 kb) as well as proteins [Manuelidis, 2011]. We are not aware of any assessments or detailed characterizations by others of non\u2010PrP proteins in more purified TSE agent preparations. Disruption of nucleic acid\u2013protein complexes destroys infectivity [Manuelidis et al., 1995; Manuelidis, 2007]. In contrast, reproducible quantitative recovery of highly infectious TSE particles without detectable PrP is clear. Marked reductions in PrP and other background proteins by PK digestion led to substantial proteomic data demonstrating non\u2010PrP proteins strongly bind to or are essential for TSE agent infectivity. One or more of these viral and cellular proteins could protect a strain\u2010specific genome. The rapid purification method detailed here is reasonably universal because it has been effective for both the FU\u2010CJD and 22 L scrapie agents. Thus, it should be effective in other models, including high titer 263 K scrapie and sCJD agent infected hamster brains. Moreover, with this streamlined procedure, isolated FU\u2010CJD brain particles contained >3 logs more infectivity than found in most test tube PrP\u2010res conversion assays done under a variety of conditions [Castilla et al., 2005; Cosseddu et al., 2011; Klingeborn et al., 2011]. Thus, the current PK treated infectious particles are a high\u2010yield source for impartially identifying critical non\u2010PrP agent components. This approach opens the window of discovery, but it will take more work to define the integral agent sequences, including viral nucleic acids and their protective capsid proteins.",

These ultrastructural particles are comparable to the biochemically isolated infectious particles of 17\u201327 nm that separate from abnormal PrP fibrils [Silveira et al., 2005; Manuelidis, 2007]. The ability of viruses to induce misfolded host proteins and pathological fibrillar aggregates has been increasingly realized on a detailed molecular level [Hou et al., 2011; Manuelidis, 2013], and the present studies are most consistent with PrP changes that are part of a host innate defense mechanism. Indeed, PrP misfolding can become a runaway pathological response to infection by environmental TSE agents [Miyazawa et al., 2012]. Additionally, stress induced protein aggregates, from bacterial biofilms to Alzheimer's amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles, and other neurodegenerative diseases where accumulation of abnormal protein fibrils is prominent, further underscore their pathologic unity [Manuelidis, 2013]. While others may wish to pursue the invisible PrP in infectious PK treated brain samples, study of the more abundant viral\u2010linked proteins that associate with TSE infectious particles would seem to be more fruitful. Viral\u2010linked peptide sequences enumerated here can be used immediately to synthesize corresponding cDNA oligonucleotides to identify agent probes that are positive in different TSE models. Common strain\u2010specific molecules can also be defined by testing cDNA probes on different human agents already propagated in a range of species and cell types [Manuelidis, 2013].",

The surprising finding here of several proteins associated with human sCJD particles, but not in normal control brain, included Wiskott\u2013Aldridch protein as well as the expected vacuolar\u2013endosomal and vesicular trafficking retromer proteins. Particular sets of these proteins in the CSF may be able to diagnostically distinguish different types of dementias at an early clinical stage. Several of these peptides also specify new pathways to target therapeutically.
