For example, the HIV model developed by Banks, et al.  [3], [4] describes how anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drives viral load in patients toward an equilibrium level that is undetectable, even by ultra-sensitive assays. When ART is interrupted, e.g., due to patient non-adherence, the HIV model converges toward an equilibrium with high viral load. Indeed, these are the dynamics observed in clinical patient data  [4]. Banks, et al. fit their HIV model to clinical patient data and exhibited that the number of HIV model parameters that could be estimated with high statistical confidence increased with the number of treatment interruptions  [2]. Thus, non-equilibrium dynamics, induced by ART perturbations, increased the data information content as calculated through asymptotic standard errors for estimated model parameters.",

To investigate this relationship, we employed an optimal experimental design theory framework  [5], [6], [7] to develop an algorithm that minimizes parameter standard errors by choosing optimal perturbations to experimental inputs. Specifically, we describe how the algorithm for optimizing selection of observation times can be extended to include optimization of experimentally controlled perturbations in order to produce data sets with maximal information content. Although we do not propose intentional perturbations in a clinical setting with patients, such a framework could be useful for gaining information from in vitro experiments where there may exist limitations on the number of observable states and observation times.",

Data from genetic networks can be collected by measuring longitudinal gene expression, either pre- or post-translational, from in vitro cell lines. Importantly, there are also several methods for experimentally perturbing in vitro gene expression at the pre- and post-transcriptional levels  [8], [9]. We recently estimated kinetic parameters for a model of a synthetically constructed gene network for the recruitment module of the Brome Mosaic Virus replication cycle  [10], [11]. In the BMV synthetic system, gene expression is tuned by the concentration of experimentally controlled chemicals. Here, we report how optimization of the experimentally controlled inputs (chemicals) for the BMV system can lead to more informative experiments, and thereby dramatically decrease standard errors for estimated model parameters, i.e., reduce dramatically the uncertainty in estimating model parameters.",

Overall, the iterative algorithm outputs an experimental design which may result in significantly lower standard errors for all parameter estimates as compared to the naive experimental design regardless of the optimal design criteria choice (Fig. 3 (left), zero iterations = naive experimental design). Between the optimal design criterion, the SE-optimal design resulted in the lowest sum of NSEs, followed by D-optimal and E-optimal designs, although we note that there was variability in this comparison for each individual parameter (Table 2).",

Taking the non-iterative algorithm results together with the iterative algorithm results, our findings suggest that input manipulation is a more powerful tool for reducing standard errors in parameter estimates than optimizing observation times for the BMV system. For example, optimizing only the observation times still resulted in unreasonably large confidence intervals for the parameter m, whereas optimizing only the experimental input resulted in acceptably narrow confidence intervals for m, as well as extremely narrow confidence intervals for all other parameters regardless of the choice of optimal design criteria (Table 1).",
