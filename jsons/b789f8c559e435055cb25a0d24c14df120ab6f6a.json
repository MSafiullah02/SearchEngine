A useful approach developed by Carr, Huddleston et al. in 1993 1,2 consists of monitoring HexNAc \u00fe (m/z 204) or Hex-HexNAc \u00fe (m/z 366) product ions during an on-line high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ESI-MS/MS experiment. Also, more recently, Ritchie et al. used precursor ion scans for ions of high m/z values rather than product ion scans to detect glycoforms of different N-glycopeptides by HPLC/MS/MS. 3 Further characterization of glycopeptides has been conducted by several research groups using MS/MS of doubly or triply charged precursor ions generated by ESI. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Overall, product-ion spectra vary considerably depending on the type of mass spectrometer and on the conditions used. Some MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides exhibit successive characteristic losses of monosaccharide units [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] and also show high abundance mono-and disaccharide ions at lower m/z values. [6] [7] [8] [9] Other cases show, in addition to the sugarrelated ions mentioned above, peptide backbone fragments that can be used for sequencing. 4, 5 With ESI-MS, the most useful information in terms of localization of glycosylation sites has been obtained by performing MS/MS on the [Peptide\u00feGlcNAc] \u00fe ions obtained by in-source fragmentation of the corresponding glycopeptides, at high declustering voltage values. The resulting MS/MS spectra provided very unambiguous sequence information, plus assignment of the glycosylation site(s). 5, 7 Whether by in-source fragmentation or collision-induced dissociation (CID) in a cell, [Peptide\u00feGlcNAc] \u00fe or [Peptide\u00feGlcNAc] 2\u00fe ions generated from glycopeptides are always abundant and constitute a good signature for these modified peptides.

Reversephase LC separation followed by direct sample deposition on a multi-well MALDI target 11, 12 greatly decreases the number of compounds per MALDI spot. The proteomic analysis is then performed on many static samples rather than dynamically on-line, using an HPLC system. Glycopeptide-containing fractions are usually identified via the observation of singly charged glycoform peaks corresponding to the same peptide, i.e. spaced by 162 u (galactose, Gal), 203 u (Nacetylglucosamine, GlcNAc) or 291 u (N-acetylneuraminic or sialic acid, NeuNAc) in the spectrum. 13 Interestingly, MS/MS analysis of glycopeptide [M\u00feH] \u00fe ions generated by MALDI in our laboratory led to consistent fragmentation patterns, 13 Scheme 1) , the latter corre-sponding to a 0,2 X 0 cross-ring fragmentation of the connecting GlcNAc residue. 14 At m/z values lower than this quadruplet, y or b ions provided most of the peptide sequence information, and no abundant sugar-residue ions were present, as reported before in ESI-MS/MS analyses of doubly or triply charged precursors. [6] [7] [8] [9] CID-MS/MS spectra of non-glycosylated peptides obtained under similar conditions using the MALDI-quadrupole-quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF) instrument 15 usually consist of y and b ions with no particular species displaying high or low abundances except for y fragments corresponding to cleavages at the Asp C-terminal side in Arg-terminated peptides. In contrast, for glycopeptides, the abundance of ions forming the group of four peaks discussed above is easily traceable and thus conducive to the recognition of glycopeptides. Moreover for most glycopeptides analyzed, the MS/MS spectrum at and below the m/z value of the [Peptide\u00feH-17] \u00fe ions resembled that of the peptide without any sugar, and could therefore be interpreted automatically using a sequencing algorithm. This routine led to database assignment of peptide identity within a protein, as if there had been no glycan attached to the peptide. Recently, Demelbauer et al. showed that a MALDI-Q-ion trap reflectron TOF instrument (QIT-rTOF) could produce similar features when operated in the MS 2 mode. 16 In this article, a fast method for detection, identification and sequencing of N-glycopeptides is presented, based on MS and MS/MS measurements using a prototype MALDI-QqTOF instrument. 15 This method was developed and tested using a mixture of proteins and glycoproteins, all obtained commercially, which were reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin all together.

The aim was not to attempt identification of all glycopeptides in a mixture, but rather to use signals that were left unidentified in a proteomics search, 17, 18 and relate these to glycopeptides through signature MALDI-MS and MS/MS patterns. A component of the research involved MALDI-MS spectra derived from the analysis of HPLC fractions containing many peptides and glycopeptides. Under these conditions it was still possible, in some cases, to quickly detect glycoforms of peptides based on the characteristic patterns of peaks separated by 162 u (mannose, galactose), 203 u (N-acetylglucosamine) or 291 u (N-acetylneuraminic acid). They are also easy to distinguish from bare (non-modified) peptides by their high m/z values relative to those of coeluting peptides. Reverse-phase HPLC elutes unmodified peptides in order of increasing hydrophobicity. The elution order, to some extent, correlates with peptide molecular mass because larger peptides are more likely to contain more hydrophobic amino acids. Therefore, early HPLC fractions were enriched with low molecular mass species and, conversely, the later fractions contained an increased proportion of large peptides. The addition of glycans results in an accelerated elution rate, i.e. a glycopeptide has a shorter retention time, but higher mass, than its unmodified analog. Typical mass spectra of HPLC fractions therefore exhibit mostly non-glycosylated peptides at the lower m/z end, and glycopeptide ions at the higher end. The latter are somewhat isolated in the spectrum, and are thus easy to distinguish from unmodified peptide [M\u00feH] \u00fe ions.

In each case, MS/MS of the [M\u00feH] \u00fe ions of these glycopeptides allowed unambiguous identification of the respective masses of the bare peptide and carbohydrate portions. MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides were readily distinguishable from those of bare peptides. In the latter cases there was a uniform distribution of ions corresponding to the stepwise fragmentation of the backbone, whereas for glycopeptides the spectra displayed a characteristic pattern where ions, only fragments corresponding to the loss of saccharide units were observed. The presence of sialic acid was clearly identified through facile losses of these residues (\u00c0291 u). Successive losses of 162 u from the precursors indicated high-mannose glycan structures, whereas mixed losses of 162 and 203 u indicated the presence of complex oligosaccharides. For all glycoforms of a given peptide, below the m/z value of [Peptide\u00feH-17] \u00fe ions, b and y ions corresponding to fragmentation of the bare peptide provided information on its sequence. In fact, this portion of the MS/MS spectra was exploited in this study for automated peptide identification and database search for the protein of origin. This feature makes MALDI-MS/MS of glycopeptide ions more useful than ESI-MS/MS, where the peptide composition must be known in order to establish oligosaccharide composition. 21 A representative example is given in Fig. 2 Figure 3 shows an expanded view of the peptide fragmentation portion of Fig. 2(b) . Interestingly this portion of the spectrum did not vary with the size of the glycan attached to the peptide, i.e. from (a) to (e) in Fig. 2 . The larger the glycan, the less abundant the ions, which indicates that for several glycoforms of the same peptide it is advantageous to perform MS/MS on the smallest glycoform in order to obtain the most complete peptide sequence information. Interestingly, the partial spectrum of Fig. 3 seems to correspond to that of hypothetical [Peptide\u00feH] \u00fe precursors and, when entered in the 'Sonar MS/MS' search algorithm, it MS/MS signatures for N-glycopeptides 2023 allowed unambiguous identification of the sequence of this peptide as GGFHNTTALLIQYENYR, and thus of the protein, glucose oxidase (residues 384-400). This result, among other identifications, is reported in Table 1 , first column on the left. The fourth column contains the scores assigned by 'Sonar MS/MS' in which a lower numerical score represents an increased level of confidence. Figure 4 shows three MS/MS spectra of biantennary glycoforms of a peptide of mass 2197 u, which was later identified by 'Sonar MS/MS' as belonging to human fibronectin. The largest glycoform analyzed corresponds to a disialylated oligosaccharide (bottom), the middle one to a monosialylated form (center), and the smallest to the asialo form (top) of the same glycan. Features observed in the top spectrum are repeated in the center and bottom spectra after loss of one and two sialic acid residues (\u00c0291 u per unit). Spectral portions above m/z 2400 exhibit successive losses of hexose (\u00c0162 u) and N-acetylglucosamine (\u00c0203 u), showing that fragmentation occurs in both chains of the biantennary glycans. In all three spectra, the [Peptide\u00feGlcNAc] \u00fe ions are abundant at m/z 2400, along with [Peptide\u00fe84] \u00fe (m/z 2280), [Peptide\u00feH] \u00fe (m/z 2197), and [Peptide\u00feH-17] \u00fe (m/z 2180) species. Figure 5 displays a close-up of the low m/z section of Fig. 4(a) , which again varies in intensity but is the same for all three MS/MS spectra in terms of ions observed. In spite of three major unidentified peaks, 'SonarMS/MS' found a matching peptide with no ambiguity, DQCIVDDI-TYNVNDTFHK from human fibronectin. Knowing the sequence, the unidentified peaks were quickly recognized as [y\u00feGlcNAc] fragments, with the GlcNAc residue adding 203 u to the masses of the predicted y and b fragments. Also, [y\u00fe83] and [b\u00fe83] fragments were identified, the 83 u portion corresponding to [CH-CH-NH-acetyl] originating from 0,2 X 0 cross-ring fragmentations of the connecting GlcNAc residues. 14 Table 2 5, 7 All peptides identified by 'SonarMS/MS' contain consensus NXT or NXS sequences (highlighted in Table 1 ), thus simplifying determination of the glycosylation site. These conclusions can be confirmed, however, by assignment of [y,b\u00fe83] and [y,b\u00fe203] fragments. Thus, for the peptide Overall, MS and MS/MS analyses showed glycoforms of 10 different peptides originating from four glycoproteins present in the original mixture. Table 1 summarizes these results. According to the list presented in the Experimental section, other glycoproteins in the mixtures should have been identified. Possible explanations for the absence of their glycopeptides from the MALDI mass spectra include incomplete tryptic digestion or generation of tryptic glycopeptides outside the mass range considered in this study, discrimination in ionization efficiency due to coelution of several peptides/glycopeptides in single HPLC fractions, inability to distinguish glycopeptide from peptide signals in some fractions, etc. For example, hen ovalbumin, which is well known to be N-glycosylated, was not detected as part of this glycomics analysis. Inspection of the sequence of hen ovalbumin reveals that the smallest possible glycosylated peptide has a mass of 3293 Da (291-322, YNLTSVLMAM-GITDVFSSSANLSGISSAESLK) without counting the glycan portion. The addition of a small hypothetical biantennary glycan would bring the mass to above 5000 Da, i.e. beyond the limit of our range of observation in this study.
