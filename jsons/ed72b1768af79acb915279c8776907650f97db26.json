While only a small percentage of patients require mechanical ventilation and ICU care, the enormous size of the populations affected means that these critical resources may become limited. A number of non-invasive options exist to avert mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. This is a clinical review of these options and their applicability in adult COVID-19 patients. Summary recommendations include: (1) Avoid nebulized therapies. Consider metered dose inhaler alternatives. (2) Provide supplemental oxygen following usual treatment principles for hypoxic respiratory failure. Maintain awareness of the aerosol-generating potential of all devices, including nasal cannulas, simple face masks, and venturi masks. Use non-rebreather masks when possible. Be attentive to aerosol generation and the use of personal protective equipment. (3) High flow nasal oxygen is preferred for patients with higher oxygen support requirements. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may be associated with higher risk of nosocomial transmission. If used, measures special precautions should be used reduce aerosol formation. (4) Early intubation/mechanical ventilation may be prudent for patients deemed likely to progress to critical illness, multi-organ failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

[6] [7] [8] Selection of respiratory support for patients affected by COVID-19 must balance the clinical benefit of the intervention against the risks of nosocomial spread. Complicating this goal is that mitigation of aerosolization by early endotracheal intubation commits to the prolonged use of an ICU bed and mechanical ventilator, which may not be available in the context of a pandemic. Therefore, management of the COVID-19-associated respiratory failure must consider the full spectrum of invasive and non-invasive ventilation options.",

A high-fidelity mannequin study demonstrated that even at the highest setting of 60 L/min, exhaled air dispersion was 17 cm in a healthy lung scenario and only 4.8 cm in a severely diseased lung scenario. 25 The authors cautioned that if the connection from the tubing to the nasal cannula becomes dis-connected there might be a risk of lateral dispersion of oxygen and pathogens. 25 Some guidelines recommend placement of a surgical mask over patients being treated with high flow therapies as a secondary safety measure. 18 High fidelity human mannequin simulation studies show surgical masks do, in fact, reduce exhaled air dispersion ( Figure 1 ). 26 If HFNO oxygen therapy is used, medical staff should use airborne protection, and the patient should be treated in a negative pressure room, if available. 2, 17 There is no currently published evidence that HFNO is a risk factor for nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens. [27] [28] [29] [30] During the 2003 Toronto SARS-CoV outbreak, HFNO was not found to be a risk factor for transmission to healthcare workers. 29 This is in contrast with endotracheal intubation, which was strongly associated with transmission to healthcare workers during the SARS epidemic. 29 For the treatment of pneumonia, HFNO was associated with reduced mortality compared to NIPPV. 21 work was performed inside a negative pressure room (Figure 1) . 11, 12, 25 Helmet mask BiPAP is unique and a similar mannequin study showed that it is safer than other models. The maximal measured dispersal distance from the helmet-neck interface was 2.7 cm when an air cushion was in place around the neck (missing air cushions cause severe dispersion). 11 The use of CPAP or BiPAP is debated in patients with COVID- In the same studies, high flow oxygen masks (defined as flow rates >6 L/min) and mechanical ventilation were not associated with nosocomial spread. 40, 41 These data may be of particular relevance to the COVID-19 outbreak, where 3019 cases have already been reported in healthcare workers including 5 deaths as of February 11, 2020. 42 It is unknown if any of these were associated with the use of any particular respiratory treatment.",
