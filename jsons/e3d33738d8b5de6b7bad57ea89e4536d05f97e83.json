Chronic rhinosinusitis is common among CF patients, and roughly 6% to 48% of these patients suffer from nasal polyposis. 3, 4 After sinus surgery, CF patients tend to have poor outcomes compared to non-CF patients. 5, 6 The histopathology is different as well. Polyps from CF patients feature a thinner basement membrane, abundant acid mucin, less submucosal hyalinization, and less eosinophilic infiltrate. 7 Defects in ion channel transport of the respiratory epithelial cells are thought to contribute to these differences. 8, 9 These alterations in ion transport lead to dehydration of mucus and impaired mucociliary clearance.

These proteins all have a role in cell-cycle progression. Bclxl is considered the dominant regulator of apoptosis. It is known to regulate interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) production in macrophages, and has been found in higher amounts in granulocytes of patients with CF. In rat models, Bcl-xl interacts with coronavirus to prevent apoptosis in epithelial cells, causing acute infection to become persistent. 17 Furthermore, the Bcl family of proteins is closely tied to p53 dysregulation, which has been recently associated with increased lymphocytic infiltrates in nasal polyps. 18 Upregulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein may interfere with the normal clearance of cells and tissue homeostasis in CF patients, thus contributing to refractory sinonasal disease and polyps in this group.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 387, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 388, "end": 390, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1003, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1175, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A number of limitations exist with the use of this protein microarray. First, with this array protocol it is not possible to separate the individual contributions of the epithelial, fibroblast, and lymphocytic populations within the overall protein extract. As a result, with this technology, we cannot conclude which cell type is dysregulated. Second, pathologic differences may not be innate to the disease process, but may be effects of the local microenvironment of the polyp biopsy. Perhaps chronic inflammation resulting from S. aureus or P. aeruginosa contributes to these changes in protein expression. Third, patient to patient variability may become a factor when grouping 3 samples together. For instance, if a single patient highly expresses a particular protein, that protein may appear to be dysregulated in the overall group. Last, one must consider that our results demonstrate roughly 2-fold dysregulation; from anecdotal experience, 10-fold or even higher dysregulation may be discovered with use of this array.

First, many programs designed to quantify the intensity of staining of a specific chromogen, such as the algorithm we used in this study, will not differentiate between specific and nonspecific background staining. In attempt to overcome this limitation, we reviewed our slides with an attending pathologist to ensure our staining was specific and that an insignificant degree of nonspecific background staining was present. Second, a trained pathologist will be superior to a computer program at distinguishing specific cell types to determine which populations might be associated with higher intensities of staining. Our algorithm did not distinguish cell types but rather quantified the average staining intensity of the entire polyp.

This technique is rapid, easy to use, and can detect protein levels as low as a few nanograms per milliliter.
