COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China [1]. As a response to a broader disease threat, China placed restrictions on travel in and out of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, but the virus was detected in Europe already in January in countries such as France (January 24, 2020) and Finland (January 26, 2020) [2]. Currently, it is not known how long there were active COVID-19 cases circling in Europe before different countries started to react to the epidemic. The first death caused by COVID-19 outside Asia occurred in France on February 15, 2020. In Italy, the number of infections started to rise rapidly in the last week of February [3]. During March 2020, almost all European countries placed at least some restrictions in an effort to prevent a further uncontrolled spread of the virus.",

The reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 has been considered higher than that of SARS. In a recent review study, the average R0 of COVID-19 was found to be 3.28 with a median of 2.79 [4]. Viral shedding of the novel coronavirus is also long (median 20 days in survivors), and nonsurvivors have died, on average, after 18-19 days of illness onset [5,6]. Case fatality and infection fatality ratios have been recently reported for China, being 3.67% and 0.66%, respectively [6]. In Europe, similar estimations have not been made yet, but COVID-19 mortality has been particularly high in some regions such as Lombardy, Italy. Data shows major country variations in the spread and mortality rates of COVID-19 within Europe, but reasons behind the spread of the disease and subsequent mortality remain partly unexplained. Different countries have also responded to the epidemic at different rates, which gives a starting point for our investigations on societal and psychological factors related to the spread of COVID-19. A social scientific perspective could help us understand COVID-19 mortality.",

This means, for example, that social activity has an impact on the spread of viruses. European countries vary greatly in terms of population density, and there are also differences in the number of social contacts people have and interact with on a daily basis. In addition, there are major cultural differences in the physical distance people keep when interacting with their close friends and other people [8]. For instance, Southern European countries have been traditionally considered as contact cultures in comparison to noncontact cultures, such as North Europe and Asia [8-10]. During an epidemic, both the physical and social closeness of people are factors that explain the spread of the disease.",

Trust in institutions and other people is considered an important factor in the well-being and overall functioning of societies [11,12]. Institutional trust can be a crucial part of epidemic management and prevention because trust in public systems and authorities such as health care systems influences how people use services and follow instructions [13]. Trust in institutions becomes important after disruptive events such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or epidemics [14,15]. Research evidence from previous epidemics showed that those who had lower trust in the government were less likely to take precautions against the Ebola virus disease in Liberia and Congo during the 2014-2016 outbreak [16,17]. Similar findings were also noted during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong [18]. Great trust in authorities has also been associated with carrying out avoidant behaviors during the swine flu epidemic in the United Kingdom [19].",

Trust in state institutions is typically highest in Nordic countries (Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden), which also rank high in different welfare statistics worldwide [22]. Elsewhere in Europe, institutional trust is found to be low, particularly in Eastern European countries but also in Southern European countries such as Italy [23,24]. Determinants of institutional trust vary across different sides of Europe, but the perceived lack of responsiveness of political and governmental entities often results in low received trust from the public. In East Central Europe, older individuals and women have been found to show more trust toward institutions, while trust in political institutions is lower among more educated people [25]. In Southern European countries such as Italy and Spain, socialization experiences are largely associated with low institutional trust, and attitudes toward political institutions are deeply rooted in cultural legacy [26]. In other words, institutional trust is lowest in those countries characterized as contact cultures. The combination of social closeness and lack of trust in authorities might turn out to be lethal within Europe, at least for older adults.",

We analyzed the difference between countries with low vs high perceived institutional trust using a random effects regression model. Figure 3 shows development after the first COVID-19 death case in low- and high-trust countries. There are no statistically significant differences between the curves. Both curves indicate increases in mortality 2 weeks after the first COVID-19 death case, and there were no statistically significant differences between them. Figure 4 shows deaths per million inhabitants for countries reacting late and early. We can see how the number of deaths per day varied in the 24 days following the first national restrictions, and there is a statistically significant difference between the curves. Increases in mortality were more rapid in those countries reacting late than those reacting early. For example, 23 days after the first COVID-19 death there were 2.5 times more deaths in late-reacting countries (4.56 deaths/million, 95% CI 3.34-5.78) than in early reacting countries (1.83 deaths/million, 95% CI 1.02-2.65).",

Those countries that are now being hit the hardest by the disease were also the ones that were slowest to react nationwide, most notably Italy, Spain, and France. Our models showed that late national restrictions predicted a higher number of deaths. Despite the unity provided by the European Union, European countries were not working together against the emerging disease threat, and the regulations progressed slowly, taking one step at a time. There were also delays in putting the restrictions into action. Some countries have also taken different strategies to the COVID-19 epidemic. In Scandinavia, for example, Sweden has adopted less restrictions than Denmark, Finland, and Norway. Sweden also had a higher number of deaths per inhabitants at the time of this writing.

Although there have been virus epidemics before, the crisis caused by COVID-19 has created a unique global situation, demonstrating how poorly the previous epidemics (eg, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome) have prepared countries to deal with this disease [33]. What has made the COVID-19 situation unique when compared to other epidemics, has been the rapid spread of the virus and the unusually hard restrictions placed to prevent physical contact and closeness between people. As European countries in general rely on individual freedom and democracy, it is difficult to close and shutdown societies completely. It becomes crucial to understand how different societies are capable of handling the crisis situation. This is typically reflected in the literature as societal resilience, and institutional trust is an important part of it [14]. As the crisis is not over, later developments will reveal what kind of role institutional trust eventually had on the wider picture, which also involves factors related to social contacts between people and timely restrictions placed within societies. Our analysis was limited to a relatively short follow-up period and the inability to control for all possible factors involved. We also wish to note that variations across countries exist. This involves, for example, the fact that high-trust countries have adopted different societal strategies to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.
