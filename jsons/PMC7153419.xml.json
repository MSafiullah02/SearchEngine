Electronic microscopy (EM) studies show that white blood cells of diabetics exhibit less protrusion and deformation, reduced phagocytosis and lysosomal functions, and that cytoplasmic organelles are rarely seen. The lower functional ability of alveolar macrophages in diabetics provides more favorable conditions for the replication of TB pathogen, thus increasing TB susceptibility in diabetic patients. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of TB patients with diabetes, alveolar macrophages and their H2O2 production are both significantly lower than normal. These factors are negatively correlated to the range of lung lesions and the bacteria quantity in sputum.",

Diabetic patients may be asymptomatic in the early stage, but once high blood sugar occurs, polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, weight loss, and other symptoms will appear, and even diabetic ketoacidosis will occur in severe patients. The WHO officially announced the diabetes diagnostic criteria in 1999: Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) level \u22657.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL); Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) glucose levels \u226511.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) at the 2 h time point; patient has symptoms of high blood sugar, and his/her plasma glucose is \u226511.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) at any time. If there are no symptoms of high blood sugar, then one of these criteria (FPG, OGTT, or non-fasting plasma glucose levels) should be checked again. In 2010, the American Diabetes Association added a glycosylated hemoglobin (HBGA1c) value of \u22656.5 % to the diagnostic criteria above (American Diabetes Association 2010).",

They may have symptoms of TB such as cough, sputum, fever, night sweats, and so on, but the symptoms are often more acute onset, with purulent sputum and hemoptysis. Therefore patients with both diabetes and pulmonary TB are easily misdiagnosed as having acute pneumonia or pulmonary suppuration. Lung wet rale occurs if there are extensive lesions or combined infections. Often, chest X-rays show that saturated, exudated, or cheese-like lesions are most common and they are easily fused, forming cavities and spreading in the bronchus. The lesion sites are not only at the common preferred site of TB but all over the lung lobes as well. The rate of lower lung lobe lesions of TB is higher in TB/diabetic patients than the patients who have TB alone. Cavity formation is more common in TB/diabetic patients, and fluid levels can occur within the hollow region (P\u00e9rez-Guzm\u00e1n et al. 2000, 2001). In addition, the rate of lower lung lobe lesions of TB and cavity formation will increase as the years progress. The sputum smear-positive ratio is higher in TB/diabetic patients than those without diabetes mellitus and there are more drug-resistant (DR) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) patients in the former group (Bashar et al. 2001; Subhash et al. 2003).",

Generally speaking, it takes 1\u20131.5 years to complete a whole course of treatment for TB, which is longer than for patients with pulmonary TB alone. If drug-resistant TB is confirmed, an even longer course is required with the appropriate drugs according to drug susceptibility testing. Some scholars believe that short-course chemotherapy programs are also appropriate for concurrent treatment of these two diseases. Studies have shown that the sputum conversion rate of new smear-positive patients after 6 months treatment could reach 94 %. Sputum conversion can fail when the patient is older than 45, has a high pretreatment smear grade, and/or has lung field lesions in more than two lung lobes (Banu Rekha et al. 2007). At present, there has not been a randomized controlled study of multicentered large numbers of samples, and there is no standard program indicating the specific time for the course of treatment. It is thought that blood glucose control is the key point for treatment in the patients with both TB and diabetes. If patients\u2019 blood glucose control is good to excellent, their sputum conversion rate after both 2 months and after 6 months of treatment will be higher than those whose blood glucose is poorly controlled (Zeng et al. 2006). But there are different views (Balasubramanian et al. 2007). The recurrence rate of pulmonary TB combined with diabetes is higher than that of nondiabetics, especially for the patients with poor glucose control.",

            "text": "Treatment of diabetes is a comprehensive program involving health education, diet, exercise, medication, and blood glucose monitoring. It aims to maintain blood sugar within a standard safety range and to avoid or reduce the incidence of complications. Specific measures could refer to the diabetes-related treatment guidelines. The TB patients\u2019 physical status is in chronic consumption, so they require a reasonable calorie intake. High-quality protein should be the main source, which, along with increased intake of both vitamins and dietary fiber, could improve in TB site repairing. Patients with hypoalbuminemia should take special care to increase their protein intake. In addition to the daily calories required (calculated according to patient body weight and activity), appropriate additional energy could be added by increasing carbohydrates to up to 45\u201360 % of the total calories consumed (Chinese Diabetes Society, China Medicine Doctor Association Nutrition Doctor Specialized Committee 2015). Some studies have shown that the plasma concentration of anti-TB drugs in TB patients with diabetes may be reduced, thus reducing the effectiveness of TB treatment (Nijland et al. 2006; Ruslami et al. 2010). Anti-TB drugs can impact diabetes. INH can interfere with the normal glucose metabolism, increasing sugar in urine and blood and increasing peripheral neuritis as well. RIF is a liver enzyme inducer, which could accelerate the metabolism of sulfonylurea and shorten its half-life, weakening its hypoglycemic effect. Aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones are harmful to the kidneys. Ethambutol can cause optic neuritis. These drugs should be used with caution in the clinic and patients should be monitored.",

TB progression is correlated with macrophages (the effector cells) and T cells (the reactive cells) of the cellular immune system. Silica dust has a cytotoxic effect on lung macrophages, causing metabolic damage to pulmonary macrophages and leading to macrophage necrosis. It was recently found that there is surfactant-associated protein A (SP-A) in silicosis bronchial washing fluid (Lesur et al. 1993). SP-A can activate alveolar macrophages and inhibit the formation of free nitrogen, making patients susceptible to M. tuberculosis (Samten et al. 2008). In addition, M. tuberculosis may escape from macrophage phagocytosis by going into the silica nodules. Activated macrophages can swallow silica very quickly and then the cell\u2019s own lysosomes release and collapse. The cell dies quickly, releasing many materials that could stimulate fibroblasts. As a result, pulmonary capillary beds and the lymphatic system can be seriously damaged, with blood vessel walls thickened and deformed. The lumen can narrow or become occluded, reducing blood circulation to the lungs. The reduced blood supply weakens the lung tissue\u2019s resistance to TB bacteria. Pulmonary lymphatic system fibrosis can prevent the lymphatic system from resisting M. tuberculosis invasion.",

But there are concerns that it is easy to get false negative results for silicosis because of extensive fibrosis and bronchial distortion which complicate the discharge of M. tuberculosis (Xie 1999; Chen et al. 2005).

Therefore, the main program for silicon TB treatment is the same as standard TB control treatment: a three- or four anti-TB drug chemotherapy program is adopted, including INH, RIF, PZA, EMB, SM, and so on, with a 3-month initial phase followed by a 6-month continuation phase (3HRZE(S)/6HR).

Imaging is an effective tool for this diagnosis. Imaging characteristic is valuable in diagnosis of pulmonary TB combined with mycetoma.The following imaging features often suggest additional pulmonary infection in TB patients:The level of emerging liquid from the TB cavity is higher than before, and the infiltrating lesion tends to absorb or the proliferative change around the cavity wall increases.Emerging abscess or cavity lesions.Substantial lesions appear besides the former lesion, or there is infiltrated shadow that does not fit the characteristics of spreading along the bronchial tubes.\nConditions such as hemoptysis causing blood or blood clots gathering in or blocking the bronchial alveoli, or TB in combination with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pulmonary edema or atelectasis, should be identified.\nSerological tests are helpful in diagnosis.

From day 5 to day 10, there is gas chamber consolidation in the inflammatory lesions with visible air bronchogram. From day 10 to day 20, the lesion develops to a half-moon shaped translucent zone (air half sign, caused by coagulation necrosis and pulmonary embolism) and it can deteriorate to complete necrosis cavity, most of which is single onset. The lesion sizes are variable and the distribution has no obvious features. Drugs for treatment could involve voriconazole,\nitraconazole, caspofungin, or micafungin, and two of them can be combined if necessary. Imaging of pulmonary cryptococcosis often has nodules or mass shadow under pleural in unilateral or bilateral lung fields, and can be single or multiple onset, with a diameter of l\u201310 cm and smooth edges or fuzzy or with small burrs. Often, there is a cavity formed, and the wall is relatively smooth with uniform and very neat low-density shadow in the nodular shadow image. It is very important in pulmonary cryptococcosis diagnosis to note the presence of nodules or masses with smooth low-density necrosis areas or cavities, especially in multiple appearances which is usually what happens in patients with healthy immune systems. In contrast, the main progression in the immunocompromised host shows parenchymal infiltration, which is hard to distinguish from pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Amphotericin B and flucytosine can be used together or fluconazole can be used for treatment, with the treatment course lasting from 8 weeks to 6 months. Itraconazole could be used orally for patients who are not coinfected with meningitis. In pulmonary mucormycosis cases, the important symptoms for diagnosis are hemoptysis and chest pain with no other signs. Its early imaging shows bronchial pneumonia, with rapid integration into a large consolidation. This is often seen with a formed cavity and a wedge-shaped shadow which can be seen at the bottom near the pleura (if there is a large pulmonary vessel embolism). This is valuable for diagnosis. Currently, amphotericin B is the most effective medicine in the clinic (the dose is 0.5\u20131.5 mg/kg/day, with the total amount of 2.5\u20133.0 g for the course of treatment).

Mechanical ventilation may cause the spread of pulmonary TB, making treatment more difficult. Studies have shown that among patients using mechanical ventilation for pulmonary TB combined with respiratory failure, the mortality rate is up to 60 %, which is similar to ARDS and twice that of pneumonia caused by respiratory failure (Lee et al. 2003; Rollas et al. 2015). Therefore, it is necessary to explore a set of effective strategies and programs to guide the application of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of pulmonary TB with respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation can be either invasive or, if external, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). Many scholars have suggested using a flexible selection scheme: for patients with respiratory failure who have no contraindications for NPPV, NPPV can be implemented and, according to patient response,\ncontinued or halted in favor of invasive ventilation. The key point of using this strategy is rationally to master the indications of NPPV and invasive ventilation as well as when to change from NPPV to invasive ventilation. NPPV is widely used clinically because it doesn\u2019t require intubation or incision and thus avoids complications of artificial airways. NPPV can also reduce the need for sedatives, as it does not affect normal swallowing, eating, or talking. It can help to preserve the air temperature and humidity of the lungs and minimize coughing. It can also be used intermittently and patients can be taken offline easily. The clinical effectiveness of NPPV should be evaluated 1\u20132 h after treatment. Signs of clinical improvement include a PaCO2 decrease > 16 %, pH > 7.30, and an oxygenation index > 164 mmHg. There are always a certain percentage of failures for NPPV treatment. Therefore, for patients with no improvement after NPPV treatment and who have indications of endotracheal intubation, prompt emergency intubation must be considered. Additionally, in the case of irritability or loss of consciousness, inability to clear secretions or tolerate the connection method, hemodynamic instability, oxygenation deterioration, or increase in carbon dioxide retention, intubation should be done\nas soon as possible.",

In addition, TB bronchiectasis and pleural thickening are often combined. Most of these patients are elderly and may have TB-associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary heart disease, and so on. There are several reasons for respiratory failure, not only pump failure, such as thorax, pleural changes, respiratory muscle fatigue, but also lung failure such as airway obstruction, lung tissue lesions, and pulmonary circulation disorders. Mechanisms of respiratory failure include both restrictive hypoventilation and obstructive hypoventilation. There is not only an increase in the functional shunt induced by part of the pulmonary alveoli hypoventilation, but there is also an increase in functional dead space due to the induction of pulmonary alveoli blood hypoperfusion. Both diffusion impairment and anatomic shunt increase. Therefore, such patients usually have both disturbed ventilation and ventilatory disorders, showing type II respiratory failure, chronic respiratory failure, acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure, and so on.
