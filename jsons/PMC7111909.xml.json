            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged, human infectious disease that first appeared in China in late 2002. Between November 2002 and July 2003, the virus spread to 29 different countries on 5 continents and was responsible for 8096 clinical cases, leading to 774 deaths (WHO, 2004). WHO case management guidelines and restricted travel advices allowed to bring SARS under control by July 2003. The etiological agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, named SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003) that is genetically distinct from previously characterized members of the Coronaviridae family (Rota et al., 2003). During the 2002\u20132003 outbreak, SARS-CoV has been isolated in Chinese civets and racoon dogs (Guan et al., 2003) from which the virus was likely introduced into the human population (Kan et al., 2005, Song et al., 2005). Other SARS-CoV-like viruses sharing more than 88% nucleotide identities with SARS-CoV have been isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats, which have therefore been proposed to represent a natural reservoir host of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005). To date, endemic bat SARS-CoV-like viruses have also been detected in Africa and Europe (for review: Balboni et al., 2012), and reemergence of a SARS-like disease from an animal reservoir remains a credible public health threat. An efficient vaccine would be the most effective way to control a new epidemic.",

            "text": "Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus whose replication takes place in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Viral particles are composed of four major structural proteins: the nucleoprotein (N), the small envelope protein (E), the membrane protein (M), and the large spike protein (S). The spike protein is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein of 1255 amino acids. It assembles into homotrimers at the surface of viral particles, and gives the virion its crown-like appearance (Neuman et al., 2006). Each monomer (180 kDa) is composed of a signal sequence (a.a. 1\u201314), a large ectodomain (a.a. 15\u20131190) with 23 potential N-glycosylation sites, a transmembrane domain (a.a. 1191\u20131227), and a short cytoplasmic tail of 28 a.a. (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The S protein is responsible for viral entry, binds to the cellular receptor ACE2 (Li et al., 2003) and mediates fusion between the viral and cellular membranes (Petit et al., 2005, Simmons et al., 2005). Structurally, the N-terminal globular head (S1 domain, a.a. 1\u2013680) contains the receptor-binding region (Wong et al., 2004), and the membrane-anchored stalk region (S2 domain, a.a. 727\u20131255) mediates oligomerization and fusion (Petit et al., 2005). Similarly to other coronaviruses, cleavage of the S protein by proteases into its S1 and S2 subunits is required for activation of the membrane fusion domain following binding to target cell receptors (Matsuyama et al., 2010, Simmons et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Due to its critical involvement in receptor recognition, as well as virus attachment and entry, the S protein is the most promising and studied candidate antigen for SARS-CoV vaccine development. It is the major target for neutralizing antibodies in human patients (He et al., 2005, Nie et al., 2004) and in animal models (Buchholz et al., 2004, Tripp et al., 2005). Passive transfer of IgG from convalescent SARS patients enhanced the recovery of acute phase patients when administered within 15 days after the onset of symptoms (Cheng et al., 2005, Yeh et al., 2005). Administration of S-specific antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, to na\u00efve animals conferred protection against a subsequent SARS-CoV infection, demonstrating that the antibodies alone can protect against SARS in mice (Bisht et al., 2004), hamsters (Roberts et al., 2006), ferrets (ter Meulen et al., 2004) and Rhesus macaques (Miyoshi-Akiyama et al., 2011). Accordingly, several candidate vaccines relying on the induction of spike-specific neutralizing antibodies, including DNA vaccines (Callendret et al., 2007, Yang et al., 2004), live viral vectors (Buchholz et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2005, Kapadia et al., 2005), live attenuated vaccines (Lamirande et al., 2008), subunit vaccines (Bisht et al., 2005, He et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2006) and inactivated virus vaccine (Stadler et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2005), have been reported to induce a protective immune response in various animal models. Only a few of them have been evaluated in phase I clinical trials and, lacking a natural challenge, there is no data on efficacy in humans (Roberts et al., 2008, Roper and Rehm, 2009).",

            "text": "An ideal vaccine against SARS should induce long-lasting protective responses after a single administration, be produced at low cost and scaled up to millions of doses. Live attenuated vaccines are particularly appropriate for mass vaccination as they are inexpensive to manufacture and induce a strong immunity and long-term memory after a single injection. To evaluate such a vaccine approach, we previously developed a vector derived from the live-attenuated Schwarz strain of measles virus (MV) (Combredet et al., 2003). MV vaccine is a live-attenuated negative-stranded RNA virus proven to be one of the safest and most effective human vaccines. Produced on a large scale in many countries and distributed at low cost through the Extended Program on Immunization (EPI), this vaccine induces life-long immunity to measles after one or two injections. We previously showed that MV vector stably expressed different proteins from HIV and flaviviruses and induced strong and long-term transgene-specific neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses, even in the presence of preexisting immunity to MV (Brandler et al., 2007, Brandler et al., 2013, Despres et al., 2005, Guerbois et al., 2009, Lorin et al., 2004). In the present study, we evaluated the immunogenic potential of recombinant MV-SARS vectors expressing either the full-length or the secreted ectodomain of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV. In a mouse model of MV infection, MV-SARS recombinant viruses induced neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV and fully protected immunized animals from intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV. Antibody responses induced by MV-SARS vectors were quantitatively and qualitatively compared to responses induced by a prototype subunit vaccine prepared from alum-adjuvanted recombinant Ssol protein.",

Their length respects the \u201crule of six\u201d, which stipulates that the total number of nucleotides into the MV genome must be a multiple of 6 (Calain and Roux, 1993). MV editing- and polyadenylation-like sequences were mutated (Lamb and Kolakofsky, 2001, Schneider et al., 1997). Both S and Ssol sequences were inserted as an additional transcription unit (ATU) into MV vector (pTM-MVSchw plasmid), which contains an infectious MV cDNA corresponding to the anti-genome of the Schwarz vaccine strain (Combredet et al., 2003) (\nFig. 1A). The resulting pTM-MVSchw-S and pTM-MVSchw-Ssol plasmids were transfected into helper 293-T7-MV cells as previously described (Combredet et al., 2003). The corresponding recombinant measles viruses MV-S and MV-Ssol were successfully rescued as indicated by the formation of syncytia, and then propagated in Vero cell culture. We analyzed the replication of MV-S and MV-Ssol viruses on Vero cells by using the same MOI (0.01) than for standard MV stock production (Fig. 1B). The growth of MV-Ssol was only slightly delayed, compared with that of parental empty Schwarz MV (MVSchwarz). The final yield, routinely obtained at 60 h post-infection, was high and identical to that of parental MVSchwarz (106\n TCID50/ml). Viral growth and yield of MV-S were more affected than that of MV-Ssol. This may be due to reduced MV budding because of the insertion of full length S at the surface of the infected cells, as already observed for MV expressing membrane-anchored forms of HIV1 gp160 (Lorin et al., 2004).",

At 48 h post-infection, IFA performed on permeabilized cells using an anti-S hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid revealed a strong expression of both full-length S and entire ectodomain Ssol of the spike protein along the compartments of the secretory pathway in measles-induced syncytia (Fig. 1C, upper panels). When infected cells were not permeabilized before labeling, only the cell surface of MV-S induced syncytia was readily stained, indicating that the membrane-anchored S is efficiently transported to the surface (Fig. 1C, lower panels). Western blot analysis of cell lysates and supernatants using rabbit anti-S polyclonal antibodies confirmed the expression of S and Ssol proteins in recombinant MV-infected Vero cells with the expected apparent molecular mass of ~180 kDa (Fig. 1D, left panel). Under reducing SDS-PAGE conditions the full length S protein migrates as a doublet, which was described as two differentially glycosylated forms (Song et al., 2004). The lighter product was suggested to be an ER-resident form of the glycoprotein and the heavier a Golgi-processed form containing complex carbohydrates. Other bands of lower molecular weight were also observed that probably correspond to minor degradation fragments, since they were not present at earlier time points (not shown). Expression levels were similar in lysates of MV-infected Vero-NK cells and SARS-CoV infected VeroE6 cells. As expected, the full-length S protein was only detected in cell lysates. In contrast, Ssol was clearly detected both in lysate and supernatant of MV-Ssol infected Vero cells at 40 h after infection (Fig. 1D, right panel), indicating an efficient secretion. Consistently, the Ssol protein secreted in the cell culture medium was heavier than the Ssol observed within cell lysates, which is in agreement with this glycoprotein being synthesized in an immature form in the ER prior to transfer to the Golgi, from which it is secreted.",

Eight to twelve-week-old male CD46-IFNAR mice were immunized with two intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections at 4-week interval of 105 TCID50 of MV-S or MV-Ssol recombinant viruses. As controls, a group of mice was injected with empty MV vector (105 TCID50) and another group with 2 \u00b5g of purified Ssol protein adjuvanted with 50 \u00b5g of aluminum hydroxide (alum), usual doses for small rodents.

We designed human codon-optimized genes encoding the full-length SARS-CoV spike (S) protein and its soluble ectodomain (Ssol). These sequences were inserted into MV vector. Recombinant viruses were produced by reverse genetics and grew at standard titers. They expressed high levels of SARS-CoV full-length spike protein at the cell membrane and led to efficient secretion of the soluble ectodomain. Immunization of mice susceptible to MV with recombinant MV-S and MV-Ssol viruses induced specific antibodies that neutralized SARS-CoV infection in vitro. The induction of measles-specific immunity was not altered by the expression of the transgenes. Immunization primed a SARS-CoV-specific memory response that was vigorously boosted by a second injection. The anchored full-length form of the spike protein induced the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies, as we previously observed with HIV gp160 (Lorin et al., 2004), and also a more robust response than a prototype subunit vaccine prepared from adjuvanted recombinant Ssol protein. As compared to immunization with adjuvanted Ssol protein, both recombinant MV-SARS viruses induced higher titers of IgG2a than IgG1 antibodies, indicating a Th1 biased response, a hallmark of live attenuated viruses and a highly desirable feature for an antiviral vaccine. Remarkably, both recombinant MV-SARS vectors also induced SARS-CoV specific IgA, whereas the subunit reference vaccine did not. This raises an interesting point since several clinical studies already evidenced that parenteral administration of live attenuated measles vaccine to children stimulates secretory IgA responses in nasal washes (Bellanti et al., 2004, Simon et al., 2011). Although we did not assess the ability of recombinant MV-SARS to induce secretory IgA in the lungs and upper respiratory tract of immunized mice, this result is strongly indicative of the potential of MV-SARS to induce SARS-CoV specific secretory IgA responses.",

(2008) that also demonstrated the induction of neutralizing antibodies in mice to SARS-CoV spike expressed by a MV vector. However, this study did not evaluate the efficacy of vaccine preparation to protect immunized mice from SARS-CoV challenge. Our observation that MV-SARS induced a strong Th1 response appears of particular importance given the recently reported safety concerns by Tseng et al., which described Th2-type lung immunopathology upon challenge of mice vaccinated with inactivated whole virus, SARS VLP or alum-adjuvanted S protein (Tseng et al., 2012). They suggested that most previously described vaccine-induced immunopathology might proceed from the same Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration upon SARS-CoV challenge. Such effects will likely not occur with live vaccines since they induce potent Th1-biased responses. In agreement with this hypothesis, it was recently reported that a live attenuated SARS-CoV lacking E protein expression provided long-term protection against lethal challenge in an aged-mice model in the absence of any sign of vaccine-induced immunopathology (Fett et al., 2013).",

Using MV as a vaccination vector presents a number of advantages: this highly efficient and most safe vaccine is easily produced at large scale, vaccine strains are genetically stable, MV does not recombine or integrate genetic material, vaccine does not persist or diffuse. The Schwarz/Moraten strain from which we derived our vector (Combredet et al., 2003) is currently the most attenuated and the most widely used measles vaccine. Measles vector expresses very stably large amounts of heterologous genetic material, likely due to the absence of geometric constraints on the size of helicoidal nucleocapsids in this pleiomorphic virus (Tangy and Naim, 2005). Although the stability of expression of the specific SARS transgene remains to be determined, the remarkable genetic stability of added, expressed ORFs has already been described by us and others for a variety of transgenes inserted into measles vector and other members of the Mononegavirales. The measles vector demonstrated a strong capacity to stimulate both cellular and humoral neutralizing immunity against a number of antigens and provided protection from experimental challenge both in mice and primates (Brandler et al., 2007, Brandler et al., 2012, Despres et al., 2005, Lorin et al., 2004, Tangy and Naim, 2005). A measles-HIV vaccine candidate currently under clinical development has been evaluated in phase I clinical trial, demonstrating the GMP preclinical and clinical safety and immunogenicity of this vector (Lorin et al., 2012, Stebbings et al., 2012).",

The presence of anti-MV immunity in nearly the entire adult human population might restrict the use of recombinant MV to na\u00efve infants, an already worthy goal in any event. However, numerous studies have shown that revaccinating immunized individuals results in a boost of anti-MV antibodies, suggesting that the attenuated live vaccine replicates and expresses its proteins in spite of preexisting immunity (Dilraj et al., 2000, Rager-Zisman et al., 2003, Sepulveda-Amor et al., 2002). Likewise, the presence of maternal anti-MV antibodies has been shown to limit the induction of anti-measles antibodies but not the induction of specific T-cell responses in infants given measles vaccine during the first year of life (Gans et al., 2003, Gans et al., 2001). Moreover, we previously demonstrated that recombinant MV vectors were immunogenic and induced protection in the presence of MV preexisting immunity in animal models (Brandler et al., 2013, Lorin et al., 2004), which opens the possibility of using recombinant MV vector to immunize adolescents and adults, although this point needs to be evaluated in human trials. Measles appears very difficult to eliminate and still causes 160,000 deaths annually worldwide, mostly in poorly developed countries (Centers for Disease and Prevention, 2009). Europe also recently experienced severe measles outbreaks (Cottrell and Roberts, 2011). Improving and maintaining measles vaccination for decades is essential to contain this most contagious disease. In this context, the use of recombinant MV designed to immunize the pediatric or adult populations appears desirable.",

These characterized SARS vaccine candidates deserve to be evaluated in a much more adapted non-human-primate model, in which the cross-protective potential of the induced immune responses against zoonotic SARS isolates/variants could be addressed. Indeed, several studies have underlined the need to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies able to protect against heterologous viral variants, which may arise during independent emergence events (Bolles et al., 2011, Sheahan et al., 2011). Such antigenic variants have already been isolated from animals during the 2002\u20132003 epidemics and from sporadic human cases during the 2003\u20132004 reemergence (Deming et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2005), and are likely to emerge again from the large heterogeneous zoonotic reservoir of SARS-like viruses, should a new outbreak occur. The recent identification of a novel human betacoronavirus, MERS-CoV, as the agent of a SARS-like illness in the Middle-East, has raised great concerns about the pandemic potential of the disease (Perlman, 2013, WHO, 2013, Zaki et al., 2012). A decade after the SARS pandemic, it has renewed worldwide attention on coronaviruses and stressed the need of continued research and investment in the development of safe and effective vaccines against highly pathogenic coronaviruses.",

The isotype determination of the antibody responses was performed using isotype-specific (IgG1 and IgG2a) secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech). IgA titers were similarly measured using mouse-specific anti-IgA secondary antibody (1/2000, Southern Biotech) and calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of individual serum, giving an absorbance of 0.2.

Neutralizing antibody titers were determined according to the Reed and Muench method (Reed and Muench, 1938) as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of each serum, which suppressed CPE in at least 2 out of 4 wells.",

Absolute quantification of RNA was done by using in vitro transcribed RNA standards prepared from the cloned SARS-CoV N gene and quantified spectrophotometrically. Analytical sensitivity of this real-time N RT-PCR assay was experimentally determined by using limiting serial dilutions of the N RNA standard. Using probit non-linear regression analysis, the 95% detection limit of the RT-PCR was calculated at 40 copies of input RNA per reaction, which corresponded to 3.8 log 10 virus genome-equivalent (geq) per mouse tissue, assuming 100% efficiency in RNA preparation.",
