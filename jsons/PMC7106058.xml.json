            "text": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a clinically important complication of severe acute lung injury (ALI) in humans, highly associated with sepsis pneumonias and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients [1], [2], [3]. Inflammatory stimuli from microbial pathogens, such as endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), are well recognized for their ability to induce pulmonary inflammation, and experimental administration of LPS, has been used to induce pulmonary inflammation in animal models of ALI [4], [5], [6]. The development of an ALI model by way of i.n. LPS instillation is well suited for preliminary pharmacological studies of new drugs or other therapeutic agents because i.n. instillation of LPS into mice can produce a controlled ALI without causing systemic inflammation and multi-organ failure [4], [7]. LPS-induced ALI is considered a neutrophil-dependent ALI that contributes to local recruitment and activation of neutrophils [8]; the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6; and the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [9], [10], [11]. Neutrophil recruitment in the lungs is regarded as a histological hallmark in the progression of ALI [12]. Several candidate therapy strategies such as fluid management, surfactants, glucocorticoids, and stem cells have been applied to treat acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in the last decade [13], [14]. However, the mortality resulting from these conditions remains high [15].",

            "text": "Fangfeng, the root of Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz) Schischk, is widely applied for headache, febrility, vertigo and arthralgia as an important member of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). It has been proved that there are numerous pharmacologic effects of the extract from Fangfeng, such as suppression of adjuvant arthritis, inhibitory effects on the peptic ulcers and analgesic, anti-convulsant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant activities, etc in modern pharmacological experiments [16]. Abundant compounds were isolated from it, such as chromones, conmarins, and polyacetylenes [17], [18]. Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin is a major active chromone isolated from Fangfeng. In recent years, it has been identified that chromones are the main active components which contribute most to its pharmacological efficacy [19], but so far, the anti-inflammatory effects of Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin on ALI has not yet been studied. Therefore, with a mouse model of acute lung inflammation, the present study was undertaken to examine the effect of Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin on acute lung injury induced by intranasal instillation of LPS in BALB/c mice and investigate its possible mechanisms.",

            "text": "The study primarily focused on anti-inflammatory effects of Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. LPS, a glycolipid that constitutes the major portion of the outermost membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, can bind to the cell membrane receptor of the monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells, then activate the signal-transduction system, thus resulting in the synthesis and release of cytokines and inflammatory mediators [22]. Excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines not only enhances immune responses by fighting invading pathogens, but also has deleterious effects like perturbing regular hemodynamic and metabolic balances [23]. Thus, it is an important target in the treatment of inflammatory diseases to inhibit the pro-inflammatory mediator. As shown in Fig. 2, the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were down-regulated while the level of IL-10 was up-regulated in the Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin group. IL-10, an anti-inflammatory, is well known to down-regulate the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12 and NO [24], [25], [26]. A number of cytokines in combination with endotoxin can cause expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in macrophages [27]. Inducible NOS is an important pharmacological target in inflammatory and mutagenesis research. It has been proved that Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin had inhibitory effect on the synthesis of NO induced by LPS in RAW 264.7 cells [28], [29]. Combined with the finding of our study, it seems like Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin inhibits the synthesis of NO by producing IL-10 in RAW 264.7 cells. The anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10 can interfere with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the suppression of NF-\u03baB activation by preserving the expression of I\u03baB protein. NF-kB is a key transcriptional factor involved in regulating the expression of proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, thereby playing a critical role in mediating inflammatory responses [30], [31]. Under resting conditions, NF-\u03baB is held inactive by I\u03baB. However, NF-\u03baB can be activated by some stimulation of various receptors including TNF receptor, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and T-cell receptor (TCR). Persistent activation of NF-\u03baB is central to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory lung disorders including chronic obstructive pulmonary, asthma, pneumonia, and acute lung injury [32]. The activation of NF-\u03baB is implicated in the MAPK signaling pathway. Inhibition of MAPK family pathway, such as ERK, p38, and JNK, alleviates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [33]. Therefore, we investigate the possibility that Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin inhibits the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 via interfering with the activation of MAPK and NF-\u03baB. The results showed that Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin obviously not only inhibited NF-\u03baB activation, but also inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 3). Based on the above observations, our results suggest that Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin had anti-inflammatory ability by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through blocking the activation of MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways in vitro.",

Neutrophils are an important component of the inflammatory response that characterizes acute lung injury (ALI) [35]. Once an inflammatory response is initiated, neutrophils are the first cells to be recruited to sites of infection or injury. Although neutrophils have beneficial actions in eradicating microbial infections, excessive neutrophil activation, with resultant release of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory mediators, results in tissue injury and contributes to the development of organ dysfunction, such as ALI [9].",

Cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, that are secreted by alveolar macrophages stimulate more chemotaxis and attract more neutrophils to injured lungs [37], [38], [39]. In our study, the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in BALF were lower in the Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin group than in the LPS group. These reductions may have contributed to the decreased neutrophil count in BALF in the LPS-induced ALI model treated with Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin.",

            "text": "Edema is a typical symptom of inflammation both in systemic inflammation and in local inflammation [40]. Permeability edema which accompanies acute lung injury, severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with alveolar fluid clearance capacity reduction, increase of capillary endothelial permeability, and alveolar epithelial barrier disruption [41]. To quantify the magnitude of pulmonary edema, we determined the W/D ratio of the lung tissue and Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin was shown to inhibit this ratio. On the other hand, MPO is an enzyme located mainly in the primary granules of neutrophils, thus MPO activity in the parenchyma reflects the adhesion and margination of neutrophils in the lung [42]. In the LPS-induced ALI model, a large amount of PMN is recruited from peripheral blood into the lung, producing a substantial amount of MPO and reactive oxygen derivatives, and finally resulting in a cascade-like response and tissue damage [12], [43]. By contrast, administration of Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin markedly suppressed LPS-induced BALF neutrophilia (Fig. 6) and MPO activity (Fig. 7), as well as ameliorated the histopathologic changes in lung tissue produced by LPS challenge (Fig. 8). Recent studies that have been conducted on pravastatin [44], ceftiofur [45], and pinocembrin [46] showed the same regulatory effects as Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin, suggesting that this agent may be an important regulator of inflammatory responses. Taken together, these results indicate that the protective effects of Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin on acute lung injury in a mouse model induced by LPS may be due to its inhibition of inflammatory mediators and limitation of inflammatory response in the lung.",

These findings strongly suggest that Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin has a potent anti-inflammatory activity and may represent a novel strategy for the modulation of inflammatory responses.
