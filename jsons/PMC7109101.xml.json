The 5-year survival rate improves to ~10% in patients who undergo surgical resection, and to ~20% with the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy. Based on the results of the ESPAC-3 and CONKO-001 trials,1\u20133 gemcitabine was established as adjuvant therapy, with 5-year survival of ~18\u201320%. In addition, it has been reported that there is no significant OS difference between patients treated with gemcitabine and 5-FU.4 More recently, two clinical trials have demonstrated a benefit from combination chemotherapy. Firstly, the ESPAC-4 study showed that the combination of gemcitabine and capecitabine improved survival compared with gemcitabine alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68\u20130.98), p = 0.032) with 5-year survival rates of 28.8% vs 16.3% (p = 0.32),5 and this regimen is now included in the recently implemented ASCO clinical guidelines.6 Secondly, the PRODIGE 24/CCTG PA.6 study7 showed that adjuvant-modified (m)FOLFIRINOX was safe, and significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) when compared with gemcitabine. Median DFS was 12.8 months in the gemcitabine arm vs 21.6 months in the mFOLFIRINOX arm (HR = 0.59 (95% CI, 0.47\u20130.74)), and median OS was 34.8 vs 54.4 months (HR = 0.66 (95% CI, 0.49\u20130.89)), respectively, such that mFOLFIRINOX is now also considered a standard of care for patients sufficiently fit to tolerate this combination. Despite these recent advances, the majority of resected patients still ultimately develop disease recurrence, and novel therapies are still required.",

Dexamethasone was used as an antiemetic with chemotherapy. The initial schedule (main cohort) of vaccination comprised TG01 (0.7 mg of intradermal injection (id)) together with GM-CSF (0.03 mg id) commencing as soon as possible after surgery, and given on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 15 and 22, and twice weekly thereafter until the completion of gemcitabine (starting within 12 weeks of surgery and given as 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle \u00d7 6 cycles). Thereafter, TG01/GM-CSF was given four weekly up to 1 year, and 12 weekly for up to 2 years. Four patients in the main cohort started vaccination at the same time as chemotherapy (i.e. received concomitant treatment as permitted by the protocol), and received TG01/GM-CSF on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 15, and twice weekly thereafter until the completion of gemcitabine treatment. After 19 patients were treated, a modified TG01/GM-CSF dosing regimen was introduced. This was to investigate whether a reduced number of vaccinations, a reduced number of DTH tests used to detect immune responses and no vaccinations during chemotherapy treatment, could still induce the same immune responses while improving the safety profile, particularly with regard to allergic reactions seen in the main cohort. Patients in the modified cohort also received TG01/GM-CSF as soon as possible after surgery, administered on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 36. Vaccination was then suspended until completion of gemcitabine treatment (six cycles). Thereafter, TG01 vaccination was given at weeks 4 and 5 post chemotherapy, and then followed the same schedule as for the main cohort.",

Five patients (26.3%) in the main cohort experienced TEAEs associated with allergic reactions; no patients in the modified cohort, with a reduced antigen burden, and a break from vaccination during chemotherapy, experienced these types of TEAEs indicating a more acceptable level of toxicity. It is possible that the total peptide load of vaccinations plus DTH tests may have contributed to the risk of hypersensitivity in the main cohort, and it appears that the mandatory prophylaxis introduced for patients in this cohort reduced the risk of further severe episodes. A cohort with a modified vaccination schedule and fewer DTH assessments was introduced, and this appears to have largely abrogated the risk of hypersensitivity reactions without the need for prophylaxis, with no significant reactions reported in patients receiving this schedule.

Our subgroup analysis showed that a similar trend with median OS for patients receiving five or six cycles of gemcitabine (or 5-FU) in combination with TG01 was 37.0 months in this subpopulation (n = 22). These findings may suggest synergism between TG01/GM-CSF and chemotherapy.",

The study has also identified the vaccination schedule for future development of TG01 in pancreatic cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The clinical efficacy endpoints of DFS and OS compare favourably to historical data reported. Since this study was conducted, recent clinical trials have demonstrated improved survival with the use of combination chemotherapy (GemCap or mFOLFIRINOX) in the adjuvant setting, in patients sufficiently fit to receive these in the post-operative setting. Nevertheless, the majority of patients still experience disease recurrence, and further therapeutic advances are required. Thus, the incorporation of a safe, well-tolerated, non-cytotoxic agent such as TG01 may be particularly attractive in this context, and based on the encouraging safety, immunological and efficacy data presented here.",
