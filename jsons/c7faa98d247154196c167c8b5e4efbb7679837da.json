Most of the progress can be ascribed to an understanding of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system for donor selection, immunosuppression for prevention and treatment of graftversus host disease (GVHD), and significant advances in infectious disease prevention, therapy and supportive care. As a result of this progress, the number of potential candidates to receive a transplant has greatly increased, and the survival figures have been progressively encouraging. In fact, the term \"hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\" (HSCT) has supplanted the previously employed term \"bone marrow transplantation\" to reflect the broader range of donor stem cell sources available: bone marrow, fetal cord blood, and growth factor-stimulated peripheral blood [1] . Unfortunately, the use of aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens frequently results in life-threatening complications, requiring transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). Pulmonary complications, both infectious and noninfectious, occur in up to 60% of HSCT recipients, and a significant percentage of them will require ICU admission [1] [2] [3] . Infectious complications are more common in allograft recipients because of the requirement of immunosuppressive agents to prevent and treat GVHD. In addition, GVHD itself causes an immunodeficient state. In contrast, noninfectious acute lung injury syndromes (e.g., idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage) occur after",

In our experience from data collected within a 10-year period [5] , 89 patients with hematological malignancies with pulmonary complications were admitted to a respiratory ICU. Fifty-two of 89 (58%) of these patients were HSCT recipients. Patients were admitted to the ICU because of ARF in 61 instances (68%; including 23 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS), sepsis syndrome (12%), pulmonary hemorrhage (9%), heart failure (8%), and miscellaneous conditions (2%). The most common cause of ARF was a pulmonary infection, which was diagnosed in 60% of the patients for whom a specific diagnosis was obtained. Other authors have also found that infection is the most frequent cause of admission to the ICU, particularly in those with neutropenia where up to 80% have a clinically documented infection [6] [7] [8] . Also, among organ failures at ICU admission, acute respiratory failure and severe sepsis or septic shock are present in up to 80% of critically ill cancer patients [2, 9] (Table 5.1) .",

Different series have shown that bacterial pneumonia is also the most common cause of admission to the ICU in HSCT recipients [11] . One of the problems in diagnosing bacterial pneumonia in hematological patients is the inability to identify the organism in the majority of these patients, which may underestimate the incidence of these infections. Factors that generally increase the risk of bacterial pneumonia following HSCT include pre-transplantation immune status, type of conditioning regimen, and degree and duration of neutropenia [12] . In transplant recipients, bacterial infections may occur at any time in the post- Modified from ref. [7] transplantation period; however, they seem to be more common in the pre-engraftment phase due to the presence of mucositis and neutropenia. Potential pathogens are myriad. Encapsulated organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, are particularly prevalent; however, many other bacteria must also be considered, particularly Staphyloccocus aureus (including methicillin-resistant, MRSA) and multi-resistant gram-negative bacilli, such as P. aeruginosa [13] . Some epidemiological studies have shown that Legionella sp. pneumonia is more prevalent in the immunocompromised host [14] . It is important to consider that 15-30% of cases diagnosed as bacterial pneumonia are mixed bacterial/opportunistic infections [11] [12] [13] . This fact has to be considered, particularly in patients that do not respond to appropriate specific antibiotic treatment.",

A steady rise in the documented cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) post-transplantation has been documented. The risk for IPA is much higher following allogeneic HSCT when compared to autologous transplantation (incidence is 2.3-15% and 0.5-4%, respectively) [15] . Mortality rates for HSCT recipients with IPA have historically been as high as 80%; however, during the past 2 decades, the outcome of this infection seems to be changing. Recently, the Prospective Antifungal Therapy Alliance Registry performed a multicenter study to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of invasive fungal infections in HSCT recipients [16] . In this study, a total of 250 proven or probable invasive fungal infections were included. Almost 70% of the patients had received an allogeneic HSCT, and 31% had received an autologous HSCT. In this series, mortality rates of 21% and 35% at 6 and 12 weeks of diagnosing proven or probable IPA were reported, numbers that are consistent with those reported by other authors, confirming the survival gain evidenced after the inclusion of azoles in the therapeutic armamentarium of invasive fungal infections. Interestingly, the absence of MV or/and hemodialysis was significantly associated with improved survival.",

The incidence of these viral infections following HSCT ranges between 11-65% [27] . Upper respiratory tract infections in HSCT recipients are usually self-limiting. However, the progression to pneumonia carries a significant associated mortality. In one study of community respiratory viral infections following HSCT, the main viruses were RSV (35%), parainfluenza (30%), rhinovirus (25%), and influenza virus (11%). Of these, pneumonia occurred in 49% of patients with RSV infection, 22% of those with parainfluenza virus, and 3% of rhinovirus infection [28] . In another recent review of 343 cases of community respiratory viral infections in 306 adults with hema tological malignancies (mostly HSCT recipients), parainfluenza (mainly type 3) accounted for 27% of infections, influenza (mainly type A) for 33% of infections, and RSV for 31% of infections. Community respiratory viral infections progressed to pneumonia in 35% of patients with equal frequency among the three viruses [27] . Interestingly, community respiratory viruses are often co-pathogens with other organisms, including bacteria, fungi (aspergillus), or other viruses (CMV). Herpes simplex virus 1 reactivates in 80% of HSCT recipients and occasionally may be associated with pneumonia. However, universal prophylaxis with acyclovir and gancyclovir has significantly reduced the incidence [27, 29] . Human herpes virus (HHV-6) may act as a co-pathogen with CMV or act as an isolated cause of pneumonia [30] .",

Suffering from hematologic malignances is one of the most powerful predictors of mortality due to ARF in the ICU, and this is particularly true when patients with HSCT are considered and when MV is required. For many years, survival was considered dismal, with physicians supporting either denial of ICU admission or considering early treatment limitation decisions. Shuster and Marion [31] found a mortality of 80% in 77 patients treated in the ICU. Our study, evaluating prognostic factors of non-HIV-positive immunocompromised patients with pulmonary complications, showed that the mortality rate among HSCT recipients was almost twofold higher than that of patients with hematological malignances or of those who had received solid organ transplants. The requirement of mechanical ventilation was a critical predictor of poor outcome with mortality rates approaching 95% [7] . Long-term survival rates after MV are also dismal in recipients of allogeneic HSCT with active GVHD, with approximately 5% of patients surviving 6 months. Consequently, some clinicians have questioned the utilization of mechanical ventilatory support for these patients.",

Second, recent series support the notion that the prognosis for hematological patients admitted to the ICU has improved compared to that reported in the 1980s and early 1990s [32, 33] . Benoit et al. [32] , evaluating a cohort of 124 patients with a hematologic malignancy admitted to the ICU for a life-threatening complication, observed an ICU and in-hospital mortality of 42% and 54%, respectively. Soubani et al. [2] evaluated 85 patients admitted to the medical ICU, representing 11.4% of patients who had undergone HSCT during the study period. Fifty-two patients (61%) survived their ICU stay, and 35 patients (41%) were discharged alive from the hospital. The long-term survival rate (>6 months) in this cohort was 28%. Moreover, 19 patients receiving MV (37%) survived their ICU stay, and 33 (97%) patients who did not require MV survived. The study showed short-term and long-term survival rates among adult HSCT recipients who had been admitted to the ICU that were higher than those previously reported. Azoulay et al. [34] , in a study evaluating a large group of cancer patients with ARF due to a variety of causes, reported a mortality rate of less than 50%, reaffirming the survival gains achieved in critically ill cancer patients in recent years.",

Rather, it is probably related to a shorter neutropenic phase, better antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment, and improved experience in the management of these patients before their condition deteriorates. Also, the improved survival may partially be explained by the implantation of restrictive policies for selecting patients to ICU admission. Although the selection of the best candidates for ICU care is difficult and there are no objective data to support the decision [36] , it is possible that selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from ICU admission might explain part of the survival gains. Also, it is possible that the decrease in mortality was, in fact, accompanied by a decrease in the number of patients requiring MV, a known risk factor for poor outcome. Reasons for a decrease in the number of HSCT patients who require MV may be related to a decrease in pulmonary complications in these patients or because hematologists and intensivists are better at the early management of pulmonary complications, thereby minimizing the number of patients who ultimately require MV [3, 37] .",

In allogeneic HSCT recipients, infectious complications are more common because they require the administration of immunosuppressive agents after transplantation to prevent or treat GVHD. In addition, GVHD itself causes an immunodeficient state by involving mucosal surfaces, the reticuloendothelial system, and bone marrow. Because of all this, the mortality of recipients of allogeneic HSCT, requiring lifesustaining measures, is extremely high [3, 9] . In contrast, autologous HSCT recipients, who receive a less intense conditioning regimen, have a similar prognosis to other critically ill cancer patients in that their short-term risk of death depends only on the number and type of organ dysfunctions. Few studies have emphasized the radically different outcomes between allogeneic and autologous HSCT recipients in the ICU. Shorr et al. [38] collected data focusing only on autologous HSCT, with the aim of determining the frequency of and risk factors for the use of MV in this population. These authors concluded that MV is infrequently needed following autotransplants. Of 159 patients included, only 17 required MV (10.7%), with 3 of them surviving the episode (17.6%). It is possible that the large proportion of autologous transplantation recipients included in the recently published cohorts might be a confounding factor and led to an underestimation of the mortality rate of allogeneic graft recipients. In particular, the recent series by Soubani et al. [2] , which showed a significant improvement in survival in HSCT recipients, included a cohort with almost half of the patients (47%) having received an autologous HSC transplant.",

            "text": "The outcome of alo-HSCT recipients requiring MV has not improved for 2 decades, with consistent survival rates of less than 20% [37, 39, 40] Patients requiring MV have a worse prognosis than similar patients matched for general severity-of-illness scoring systems such as APACHE II, because MV may be directly injurious through increasing the risk for nosocomial pneumonia [41, 42] . Moreover, the association of ARF requiring MV with other organ failures has been reported to be almost uniformly fatal (Fig. 5.1) . The avoidance of intubation using ventilatory strategies aimed at minimizing further lung injury may change the dismal prognosis associated with MV in HSCT recipients. Different studies have shown that early implementation of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is indicated in an early stage of hypoxemic ARF in immunocompromised patients, since it decreases both the requirement of intubation and the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, and consequently this ventilatory support might improve survival [43] [44] [45] . However, caution should be used concerning the unselective use of NIV in immunocompromised patients. Azulay et al. [34] conducted a prospective study to identify factors associated with death in critically ill cancer patients admitted for ARF. These authors observed that mortality in patients treated with NIV who subsequently did not require conventional MV was only 15%, confirming the critical goal that this technique can add to the management of critically ill cancer patients. However, mortality in patients that required conventional MV after 72 h of NIV was very high. The absence of benefit from NIV in patients with severe lung involvement is in agreement with previous reports, suggesting that in selected cases NIV might have a deleterious impact by delaying conventional MV in patients who have ARDS and are managed with nonoptimal diagnostic and treatment strategies. Depuydt et al. [46] , in a retrospective revision of 26 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with NIV for ARF, could not demonstrate a survival benefit for the use of NIV in comparison with control patients receiving MV and matched for SAPS II. In this study, NIV was mainly used for the treatment of patients with acute severe hypoxic failure, and 60% of them required immediate endotracheal intubation as well as vasopressor therapy because of circulatory shock [45] . They hypothesized that the protective effect of NIV might be exerted only if applied immediately in an early, more compensated phase of their critical illness.",

The possibility of non-infectious complications and the difficulty of making an antibiotic selection in light of growing resistance and the wide spectrum of potential etiologic factors emphasize the importance of designing strategies aimed at obtaining an early diagnosis. This is particularly true if we consider that inadequacy of the empirical treatment in the ICU setting increases the risk of death significantly [47] . In this sense, it has been shown that early diagnosis of both viral and fungal infections decreases mortality [48] . The use of both non-invasive and bronchoscopic techniques may facilitate the diagnosis in the majority of cases [49] . Some authors advocate the use of non-invasive diagnostic techniques as the cornerstone of the diagnostic workup of these patients, leaving bronchoscopic techniques for those selected patients with no evident risk of deterioration [50] . However, various studies in non-hypoxemic patients outside the ICU have shown that fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a low-risk procedure that can be performed in most patients and may add to the prompt identification of the specific etiologic agent, facilitating an etiology-guided treatment and avoiding unnecessary and potentially harmful additional treatment [51] .",

As a result, survival in these patients has improved over the last decade. Thus, the general reluctance to admit patients with a hematologic malignancy to the ICU, even those with severe critical illness, is currently no longer justified. Not all transplanted patients with ARF can be expected to succumb. In the select, low-risk population of patients with autologous SCT with ARF, survival rates fall within a range that we see for many other diseases that are routinely managed in ICU, such as sepsis-related ARDS [42] . In these patients, dedicated and aggressive support in the early phases of respiratory failure to attempt to establish an etiology seems warranted, allowing the early introduction of specific treatment. Early diagnosis is advantageous, and bronchoscopy, when carefully indicated, substantially increases the diagnostic yield, causing changes in the empirical treatment in the majority of patients [7] . The appropriate timing for withholding or withdrawal of support is probably the most contentious issue surrounding the care of these patients [42] . In patients in whom potential benefits of ICU admission are in doubt, a trial of full intensive ICU management should be given for a limited time period, during which daily evaluation of organ dysfunction may provide a more accurate prediction of survival than at admission [9] .",
