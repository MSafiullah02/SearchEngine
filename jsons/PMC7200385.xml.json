However, the heavy workloads laboratories currently have to deal with for the diagnosis of COVID-19 worldwide makes the hypothesis of further scaling up for anorectal screening in all women programmed for vaginal birth and potential SARS-CoV-2 carriers, an unlikely proposition. Currently, there is no strong evidence in support of elective Caesarean section (CS) either in these patients if anorectal swab results are not available.",
