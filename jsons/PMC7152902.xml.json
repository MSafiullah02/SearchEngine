But even in \u201cnormal\u201d times, older adults\u2013particularly the oldest old and those with underlying health conditions\u2013frequently rely on the ED for care. In the United States (U.S.), older adults account for over 15% of the almost 150 million visits to the ED annually. Older adults in the ED tend to have a higher level of medical urgency, are more likely to undergo extensive diagnostic testing, have longer stays in the ED, and are more likely to be admitted to the hospital subsequent to the ED visit.1 These statistics are even more stark for older adults with additional vulnerabilities, such as older adults with dementia.2\n",

Both the physical design and the processes of care in the ED are designed for the purpose of rapid triage and diagnosis\u2014goals which are not necessarily aligned with the characteristics and needs of older adults.3 For example, equipment crowded into a small exam area and slippery linoleum floors increase fall risk for older adults. Constant beeping of equipment, lack of space for caregivers to accompany patients, and bright fluorescent lights on all night may increase risk of delirium. Providers are expected to assess patients in mere minutes, but it is difficult if not impossible to assess the complex medical conditions and subtle presentations of older adults under such circumstances. As a result of the mismatch between care delivery in the ED and needs of older adults, older adults often experience poor outcomes as a result of ED visits. These poor outcomes are well-documented, and include falls, delirium, functional decline, and increased mortality.4\n",

Physical spaces incorporate the needs of older adults, including nonskid floors, handrails, lighting that follows diurnal patterns, and pressure-reducing air mattresses.

A number of research studies have examined nurse-led multidisciplinary GEDI's. For example, a study of a Transitional Care Nurse model, in which an ED nurse was trained to facilitate care transitions for older adults, reduced subsequent inpatient admissions by 5%\u201316%.9 However, other studies have shown mixed results on the impacts of nurse-led interventions, demonstrating there is still more work to do to understand the best models of care.10\n",

For example, institutions could implement a geriatric practitioner model, where a clinician geriatric expert, such as a geriatric nurse and/or advanced practice nurse, are available for consultations for individual patients, as well as responsible for leading education efforts on the unit. Moreover, nurse educators should ensure that they are teaching principles of geriatric care to all of their staff and students.",

Moreover, fewer than 1% of registered nurses specialize in geriatrics, and this number is declining.
