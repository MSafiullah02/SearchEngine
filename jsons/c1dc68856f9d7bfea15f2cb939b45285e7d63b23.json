All human coronaviruses characterized at present are associated with respiratory illnesses, ranging from mild common colds to more severe lower respiratory tract infections. Since the etiology of a relatively large percentage of respiratory tract diseases remains unidentified, it is possible that for a certain number of these illnesses, a yet unknown viral causative agent may be found. Screening for the presence of novel coronaviruses requires the use of a method that can detect all coronaviruses known at present. In this chapter, we describe a pancoronavirus degenerate primer-based method that allows the detection of all known and possibly unknown coronaviruses by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of a 251-bp fragment of the coronavirus polymerase gene.",

However, the recent identification of HCoV-NL63 demonstrated that this novel coronavirus could not be amplified by the consensus RT-PCR described by Stephensen and colleagues, which might be explained by the presence of several mismatches in the primer sequences. We designed a novel pancoronavirus RT-PCR in which we modified the coronavirus consensus RT-PCR primers based on an alignment of the HCoV-NL63 sequence and the corresponding sequences of 13 other coronaviruses. Theoretically, this pancoronavirus RT-PCR should amplify a 251-bp fragment of the polymerase gene of all coronaviruses known at present, and we tested this experimentally for the five known human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1, and SARS-CoV) and three animal coronaviruses (PHEV, FIPV, and MHV). The sensitivity of the pancoronavirus RT-PCR was found to be lower than for a nondegenerate RT-PCR, which can be explained by the high level of degeneracy of the pancoronavirus primers. Nevertheless, this pancoronavirus assay is a useful tool for screening sample collections for the presence of all known and potentially yet unknown coronaviruses (5).",

If a single 251-bp band is visible after EtBr staining, purify the total amplification product by using the MSB Spin PCRapace purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitek MSB Spin PCRapace purification kit handbook). 2. If more than one band is visible, including a 251-bp band, run the total amount of PCR product mixed with 5 l loading dye on a 1.5% agarose gel (in 1X TAE buffer) on 100 V, 500 mA for 1 h. Stain for 10 min with EtBr, and cut each band from the gel with a sterile scalpel. Purify the fragments excised from the agarose gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit according to the Spin Protocol in the QIAquick gel extraction kit handbook. Such a FASTA file can then be used for nucleotide similarity searches using the NCBI WWW-BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) server on the Gen-Bank DNA database release 155.0 (6). The coronavirus type that is present in the sample can be determined by using this BLAST analysis, which provides coronavirus sequences that show the highest nucleotide similarity with the sequenced fragment (see Note 12). Furthermore, a FASTA file of the sequence data can be loaded into a multiple sequence alignment program such as CLUSTAL X version 1.82 (7), and the resulting alignment can be manually edited in the GeneDoc Alignment editor (8). Starting from a sequence alignment that compares nucleotides at homologous sites, i.e., sharing a common ancestor, a phylogenetic tree can be constructed using phylogenetic programs such as MEGA version 3.1 (Fig. 2) (9) . The construction of a phylogenetic tree based on sequence data of samples and coronavirus sequence data from GenBank will provide information regarding the genetic and evolutionary relatedness of a coronavirus detected in a sample to other known coronaviruses (see Note 13).",

Another precautionary measure that can be taken is to use tissue paper when opening the samples to avoid the formation of aerosols. 3. For modification of the coronavirus consensus RT-PCR primers (4), an alignment of the polymerase gene sequences of 14 known coronaviruses was made (Fig. 1) . While 50 copies of HCoV-OC43 RNA copies per microliter sample could be detected, the sensitivity for HCoV-NL63 was slightly lower, i.e., 5 \u00d7 10 3 RNA copies per microliter sample. 5. An important precautionary measure when performing RT-PCR is to avoid RNase contamination. Therefore, all materials should be RNase-free, and gloves and a gown should be worn even when preparing the (noninfectious) master mix. In addition, an RNase inhibitor (RNase OUT, Invitrogen Life Technologies; 20 units per reaction) can be added to the RT-PCR reaction to inhibit degradation of the RNA sample owing to RNases. This measure should be taken especially when a positive control RNA sample no longer amplifies. 6. Include negative as well as positive controls in each RT-PCR. A negative control consists of a sample containing only the master mix without RNA (10 l of water is added instead of RNA). As a positive control, RNA of a human coronavirus (e.g., HCoV-OC43) can be used. 7. When adding the RNA samples to the master mix, precaution must be taken to avoid RNA contamination. Such a precautionary measure is opening the tubes with tissue paper, thereby avoiding the formation of aerosols, as the latter could lead to cross-sample contamination. 8. It is advised to load the Molecular Weight Marker on both sides of the gel, as a gel can show the phenomenon of \"smiling,\" which makes the determination of the fragment size difficult when the MWM is only present on one side of the gel. 9. Use two pairs of gloves when handling ethidium bromide, as this intercalating agent is highly mutagenic. 10. Amplification of a 251-bp fragment of the coronavirus polymerase gene was demonstrated for HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, PHEV, FIPV, and MHV-A59 (Fig. 3) and for HCoV-HKU1 (data not shown). 11. The DNA pellet is often not visible. Therefore, during centrifugation the tubes are always put in the same orientation in the centrifuge, so that one knows at which side of the tube the pellet is located. The aspiration of supernatant should be performed carefully without touching the pellet. 12. The polymerase gene is a very conserved region in the coronavirus genome.",

Nevertheless, this sequence information allows a primary identification of the coronavirus type that is present in a sample. 13. The genetic and evolutionary relatedness to known coronaviruses can be determined from the phylogenetic tree clustering pattern of the coronavirus sequence fragment, amplified from a sample. A phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes that are connected by branches. The external nodes represent the existing organisms or taxa, while the internal nodes represent the (hypothetical) ancestors of the existing taxa. The length of the horizontal branches is indicative of the evolutionary distance between the connected nodes, whereas the vertical branches are noninformative. Taxa that are present in the same cluster are monophyletic, which indicates that they show a (relatively) close genetic relatedness.",

Add 10 l RNA-extract to the tube containing 40 l of the master mix, leading to a final reaction volume of 50 l (see Notes 6 and 7). The reaction is carried out with an initial reverse transcription step at 50 \u2022 C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation at 95 \u2022 C for 15 min, 50 cycles of amplification (30 sec at 94 \u2022 C; 30 sec at 48 \u2022 C; 1 min at 72 \u2022 C), and a final extension step at 72 \u2022 C for 10 min in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). 3. Load 9 l of PCR product mixed with 1 l loading dye on a 6% PAGE gel. Load 3 l of MWM VI on each side of the gel (see Note 8). Run the gel at 200 V, 200 mA for 30 min. Visualize the bands by illuminating the gel with UV-light on an Imagemaster VDS system after staining the gel for 5 min with ethidium bromide (EtBr) (see Note 9). 4. Determination of the fragment size is performed by comparing the length of the bands to MWM VI. Samples from which a PCR product of approximately 251 bp is amplified are presumed to be coronavirus-positive and will be subject to further (sequence) analysis (see Note 10).",
