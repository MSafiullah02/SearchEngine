            "text": "Rice cultivation started to take a heavy toll when immigrant peasant farmers cleared large areas in the lowland forests of Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. These countries became an important rice exporting region-the rice bowl of Asia. Other Southeast Asian countries followed, deforesting large areas of Sumatra and Java. Over ten million hectares of forests was cleared before 1920, although records of how this happened seem to be inconclusive. The Philippines, which had been under more than 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, also lost forest in the central places of Luzon, mainly to plantations of commercial crops such as tobacco and sugar cane. The colonial influence on the expansion of commercial crops was also noticeable in Assam, India where the British East India Company expanded its tea estates at the cost of tropical forests. In West Africa, mainly in Ghana and Nigeria, rainforests were cleared in the last quarter of the nineteenth century for some of the first commercial cocoa and oil palm plantations. The rainforests of Latin America, on the other hand, had hardly been affected by commercial agriculture before 1920, with the exception of some coffee plantations, for example in the areas northwest of S\u00e3o Paulo. Most of the deforestation in South and Central America was caused by shifting agriculture, which usually affected relatively small areas compared to cultivation in South and Southeast Asia. A notable exception to this pattern of moderate deforestation was the Brazilian Atlantic coastal forests, which had already been decimated in the initial phases of colonization in the Portuguese-controlled areas. {\u2026} At the global level, the level of deforestation remained modest until about 1920, as agricultural expansion happened mainly in temperate countries until that time. The world population had grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 1.9 billion by 1920. {\u2026} Through the 1920s and 1930s, tropical deforestation accelerated massively to almost eight million hectares per year. {\u2026} In the aftermath of World War II, from 1950 to 1980, tropical deforestation increased even further. An estimated eleven million hectares of tropical rainforest disappeared every year in the 1970s-at least, this was the widely cited figure from a first assessment published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 1976. 31 For another comprehensive resource on the historical overview of deforestation, see Deforesting the Earth: From Prehistory to Global Crisis, An Abridgment, by Michael Williams. 32",

As Nigel Sizer, the former director of The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) Forest Conservation program in Jakarta, Indonesia, explained, \"There is not just one factor that is leading to this wholesale slaughter of the Indonesian forests; it's a combination of weak governance, poor law enforcement, ill-advised government policies, and lack of alternative income opportunities for the rural poor.\" 34 Similarly, after World War II, tropical rainforest deforestation and degradation accelerated due to a variety of forces including, but not limited to:",

The world may literally eat up the tropical rainforests, these being the only large areas still available for agricultural expansion. Unfortunately, it is more profitable to produce a few tons of beef or animal feed per hectare than to maintain that hectare as intact tropical rainforest. 36 Much of this tropical rainforest deforestation and degradation is concentrated in select regions, such as Brazil's Arc of Deforestation and within Indonesia's Riau Province in Sumatra, and results from a few select agricultural soft commodities including cattle, soy, and palm oil. For example, \"from 1996 to 2005 the Brazilian states in the arc of deforestation-Mato Grosso, Rond\u00f4nia, and Par\u00e1-accounted for 85 percent of deforestation in the Amaz\u00f4nia Legal region, with an average of 1.66 million hectares of forest loss per year.\" 37 Similarly, \"it revealed that Sumatra and Kalimantan together lost 5.39 million hectares or 1.15 percent annually of forest cover between 2000 and 2008-more than the area of Costa Rica. Almost half this loss happened in just two provinces: Riau in Sumatra and Central Kalimantan.\" 38 The following map depicts these deforestation fronts.

The most publicized study, a 1989 Nature piece by respected botanists Peters, Gentry, and Mendelson, cataloged the marketable fruits, cocoa, oils, rubber, and medicines from tiny rainforest patches in the Peruvian Amazon. The group reported that profits from harvest of these products are two to three times greater over time than logging or clearing the forest for pasture. Seventy-two species on the site yielded products with actual market values in the neighboring city of Iquitos, Peru. Factoring in heavy transport costs and the cost of saving 25 percent of fruit harvests for regeneration, Peters et al. found that one plot could sustainably net U.S.$322 per hectare per year. Studies of A\u00e7a\u00ed palm fruit harvesting near Bel\u00e9m have also shown sustainable profitability without cutting forests. 77 The Amazon Rainforest is the world's largest tropical rainforest, and the Amazon River Basin is one of the largest sources of freshwater on Earth. It is estimated the Amazon River Basin contains \"12-20 percent of the world's freshwater. The Amazon biome drives atmospheric circulation in the tropics by absorbing energy and recycling about half the rainfall. This biosphereatmosphere 'pump' is an important control mechanism for rainfall patterns in other parts of the continent, particularly its central and southern zones.\" 78 Rainforests also help regulate the water cycle as trees can act as a sponge to moderate the release of water.

In fact, the Brazilian biologist Dr. Patricia Medici refers to the tapir as the \"Gardener of the Forest\" for their seed dispersal role. 81 According to the Infectious Disease Emergence and Economics of Altered Landscapes (IDEEAL) Project of the EcoHealth Alliance, Land-use change is a significant driver of emerging infectious disease. Over 60 percent of emerging infectious diseases over the past six decades, including SARS, H1N1/Swine Flu, and HIV-AIDS have originated in animals, with nearly half of these linked to changes in land-use. 82 The outbreak in 2013-2015 of the Ebola virus in West Africa is at least partially attributable to deforestation and forest fragmentation. 83 Furthermore, forests are both a source of GHG emissions and a sink for GHG emissions, in the sense that forests store a significant amount of carbon. It is estimated for \"the decade 2001-2010, total GHG FOLU {Forestry and Other Land Use} emissions were 3.2 GtCO 2 eq/yr {3.2 Gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per year} including deforestation (3.8 GtCO 2 eq/yr), forest degradation and forest management (\u22121.8 GtCO 2 eq/yr), biomass fires including peatland fires (0.3 GtCO 2 eq/yr), and drained peatlands (0.9 GtCO 2 eq/yr).\" 84 This source of GHG emissions-much of which is from the conversion of tropical rainforests to commercial agriculture and cattle ranches-is second only to the power sector and has literally more emissions than the entire world's transportation sector and all of its cars, buses, planes, and ships.",
