These gatherings might be planned or unplanned and recurrent or sporadic. Examples of MGs include World Youth Day, the summer and winter Olympics, rock concerts, and political rallies. MGs pose many challenges, such as crowd management, security, and emergency preparedness. Stampedes and crush injuries are common, the result of inevitable crowding. Outdoor events are associated with complications of exposure, dehydration, sunburn, and heat exhaustion. Other health hazards arise from lack of food hygiene, inadequate waste management, and poor sanitation. Violence is unpredictable and difficult to mitigate whether the MG is a political rally or a sporting competition. With few exceptions, however, the rates of morbidity and mortality resulting from these hazards are rarely increased outside the event. Global MGs, however, can lead to global hazards. Mitigation of risks requires expertise outside the specialty of acute care medicine, event planning, and venue engineering.",

The infection spread to remote areas of British Columbia in weeks, causing substantial morbidity among its indigenous peoples.21 Occasionally, the athletes themselves transmit infections. An outbreak of chicken pox occurred among members of the Maldives volleyball squad at Doha's Asian Games in 2006 and was successfully managed by use of quarantine, antiviral drugs, and vaccine.22 International organisers of the Olympics have paid close attention to security risks after 11 Israeli athletes and coaches died in a gunfight with terrorists at the Olympics in Munich, Germany, in 1972. One bystander was killed as a result of a bomb explosion at Atlanta's Olympic Park, GA, USA, in 1996.23, 24\n",

During the 1 month insurrection that ensued, half the city was destroyed and more than 30 000 people died.25 Although sports violence continues to be a risk during matches between rival teams, the massive crowds, crowds in motion, and immovable barriers cause the greatest loss of lives. The worst sports riot in history occurred in South America during a 1964 football playoff game between Peru and Argentina when fans responded in protest after a controversial decision to annul a goal by Peru. Police responded by throwing teargas canisters into the grandstand. More than 500 fans were injured and another 318 died. Most were crushed trying to escape the locked stadium, others died from teargas asphyxiation. The disaster in Hillsborough, UK, in 1989 was the worst stadium tragedy in British history. 96 fans died and another 766 were injured as crowds surged into the stadium crushing others in front who were pinned against fences. Many of the deaths resulted from compressive asphyxia while standing. Ineffective crowd control and poorly designed venues have also resulted in deaths at music festivals, most recently in 2010 during the Love Parade in Duisburg, Germany, in which 21 people were crushed to death and 500 were injured as a result of a stampede in a narrow tunnel. Occasionally, MGs cause structural stresses that threaten safety and security. In 1987, the 50th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, CA, USA, was celebrated by closing it to vehicular traffic. Though not catastrophic, the suspension cables had the greatest load factor ever when 500 000 pedestrians crowded onto the deck, flattening its centre span.26\n",

Colonial powers at the time were suspicious of political Islam, which was referred to as wahabism. Direct engagement in Hajj-related affairs was seen as too intrusive by politically savvy imperialists who recognised the sanctity of this little understood religious pilgrimage. Instead, supervision, albeit displaced, and management of Hajj were gradual processes, including surveillance, regulation, secure passage through the Red Sea and protection of British littoral interests, and eventually formal organisational processes, which would quickly become central to these hidden concerns. Imperial organisations linked cholera morbus, a non-epidemic diarrhoea, to Hajj, allowing a public health industry to develop that used health concerns to control immigration, pilgrim passports, proof of sufficient funds to allow return travel, maritime regulation, and vessel quarantine procedures.",

Increasing numbers of people attending the modern Hajj led to a 1980 decision by Saudi aviation authorities to partition Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport and create a separate south terminal to serve all pilgrims. Now two-thirds completed, the terminal's capacity is 80 000 travellers at any time. When completed, its final capacity will be greater than 30 million passengers per year. Important new features include health-screening systems, customs, and immigrations security. Each of its 18 hubs receives pilgrim flights; all hubs have two examination rooms. The terminal also features large holding areas that allow efficient reviews of selected arrivals in segregated parts of the terminal.

Although not compulsory, Umrah draws an additional 5 million pilgrims per year to the country; Jeddah's airport plays a major part throughout the year, controlling access and enforcing health protocols. Groups exiting the country and returning home are also monitored, allowing comparative studies between the two populations. At various times of the year, but most intensely during the Hajj season, public health teams, both stationary and mobile, use mobile devices to monitor inbound and outbound populations. Protocols are based on regularly reviewed case definitions. Gathered data are sent to centralised databases for real-time analysis. Many diseases are monitored during a Hajj season. Those given specific attention every year include both mild and severe respiratory diseases, food poisoning and gastroenteritis syndromes, haemorrhagic fevers, and meningococcal diseases. Reports of all diseases, but particularly those with immediate effect worldwide\u2014severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, cholera, yellow fever, polio, plague, meningitis, and viral haemorrhagic syndromes\u2014are expedited to WHO epidemiologists who work closely with Saudi authorities to analyse information and coordinate a response.

The pilgrims wear simple clothing, women and men comingle, women are enjoined not to cover their faces, children and adults of all ages are included, and families journey together. On arrival in Mecca, Hajj pilgrims do a series of synchronised acts based on events in the lives of Ibrahim (Abraham), his wife Hajra (Hagar), and their son Ishmael. Each pilgrim does an initial circumambulation (tawaf) around the central Ka'aba seven times. When completed, the pilgrim leaves for Arafat, about 22 km east of Mecca. Hajj culminates in Arafat on the Day of Standing, when all 2\u00b75\u20133\u00b70 million visitors stand and supplicate together on the mountain. Mount Arafat is believed to be the site of Mohammad's last sermon to his followers. Many people attempt to pray at the summit believing prayers there are the most blessed. On the way to Arafat, the pilgrims make overnight stops for prayers and contemplation in Mina. Leaving Arafat, the pilgrims return to Muzdaliffah, where stones are gathered; on the way to Mina, they stop at Jamarat bridge to throw stones at the pillars that are effigies of Satan. When the pilgrimage is complete, the new Hajjee (pilgrim who has completed the Hajj) makes an animal sacrifice thanking Allah for accepting his Hajj. This is often a proxy sacrifice because the Saudi Government has established modern abattoirs that are staffed by professionals who will do this on behalf of the pilgrims. Meat is then distributed to the poor, family, and friends. The final farewell is undertaken with another seven circuits around the Ka'aba. Muslim men on completion of a successful Hajj shave their heads. After completion of the Hajj, most pilgrims exit the country at Jeddah airport, which has congestion so great that the telecommunications infrastructure has to be constantly updated to allow sufficient capacity. A smaller number of pilgrims will visit the holy mosque in Medina. Some will also visit tourist sites in the Hijaz and the old city of Jeddah.",

In the operation and management of an MG, several sectors\u2014health care, security, and public communications\u2014need to know how to interface with public health services and resources quickly and effectively. Involving public health experts with the broader civic planning for any MG helps with parallel transparency in needs and expectations, ensuring that public health considerations are factored into the entire planning process instead of intruding too late in development, relegating public health security concerns to little more than ineffective afterthought. Delayed entry of these actors into the planning process can debilitate or completely disable adequate responses to potential diseases during MGs. Experts must educate civic planners about the values of early collaborative approaches to MGs for these reasons.",
