As of March 19th, 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China, and there are more than 130,000 cases of infection outside China. COVID-19 progresses rapidly, with a small number of patients becoming severe and critically ill, and multiple organ failure (MOF) in the terminal stage leading to death [2]. Existing evidences show that the elderly patients with some chronic diseases have a poor prognosis, and these patients are most likely to develop into critically ill pneumonia [3]. Improving oxygenation and lung protection is the core of multi-organ function supportive treatment for this type of patients. Tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation is an important pulmonary ventilation strategy. Mechanical ventilatory support with tracheal intubation may improve oxygenation and help improve outcome. However, it also has possibility to aggravate lung injury and induce circulatory derangement.",

SPO2 improved significantly after tracheal intubation in all patients (83.10 \u00b1 9.63 vs. 93.65 \u00b1 6.65%, p < 0.05), Since the administration of anesthesia drugs are individualized during induction of intubation, and at the same time assisted with vasoactive drugs such as ephedrine or epinephrine, so there are no significant fluctuations before and after intubation in heart rate and mean arterial pressure.

Recent studies have also reported the phenomenon of some false-negative test results [8]. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 mainly invades the lower respiratory tract, which may prevent the virus from being collected by throat swabbing. Although it is not tested in the present dataset, collecting sputum in the airway through the tracheal tube after intubation may help to improve the success rate of the RT-PCR test.",

After the machine has been worked for 5 min, the anesthesiologist who would practice intubation wore the positive pressure headgear and connects the headgear and the ventilation tube with the assistance of the assistant. The assistant wore a face screen. Both wore another layer of gloves. A rapid anesthesia induction with a sufficient dose of rocuronium was used. No mask ventilation before the laryngoscope was used to minimize aerosol contamination. Tracheal intubation was performed by exposing the glottis with a video laryngoscope. The headgear is disposable, they were thrown in the designated trash bin after use, and the positive pressure system was sterilized by low-temperature formaldehyde. During the observational period, none of the 17 anesthesiologists were infected.",
