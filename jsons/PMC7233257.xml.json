A novel coronavirus named as the 2019-nCoV previously and renamed as SARS-CoV-2 by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses[6] was isolated from these patients in Wuhan by Chinese scientists On Jan 10, 2020. Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2 originated via natural selection[7] differs from Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV[[8], [9], [10]]. It was found that the SARS-CoV-2 infection could cause not only clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to SARS-CoV-1, but also mild upper respiratory diseases and asymptomatic infection[[11], [12], [13]].",

Moreover, details of the laboratory assessments such as complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum biochemical tests and inflammatory factors associated with severity of COVID-19 have not yet been well described. In addition, previous studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 can co-infected with other respiratory virus[14] and will also have secondary infections with bacteria and fungi[13, 15], however, the information of co-infection with other respiratory pathogens especially atypical pathogens is still scared. Therefore, we present details of 354 inpatients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University to further explore the clinical characteristics and co-infections with other respiratory pathogens of patients with COVID-19 as well as the sex differences in clinical characteristics and the factors associated with severity of COVID-19.",

Whereas, we found 63.64% (7/11) of the 11 non-survivors were co-infected with other respiratory pathogens, especially Candida albicans and drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Meanwhile, 75% patients co-infected with other bacterial and fungi were found to be concentrated on patients older than 50 years. In addition, we found co-infection with other respiratory pathogens, lymphocyte count and levels of D-dimer were associated with severity of COVID-19. And the patients grouped in critical cases presented the highest mortality rate and displayed the lowest lymphocyte count and the highest levels of D-dimer and the highest rate of co-infection with other bacterial and fungi significantly. Thus, untimely detection and treatment of co-infections with other respiratory pathogens especially fungi and drug-resistant bacterial may be an important cause to mortality in COVID-19. In particular, the highest levels of IL-6 and IL-10 and the lowest levels of TNF-\u03b1were observed in subjects of critical groups. These results suggested that levels of IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1could be used for clinical classification of COVID-19.",

However, the mechanisms underlying these differences are still not clear. The reduced susceptibility of females to SARS-CoV-2 infections could be depended on the protection of X chromosome and sex hormones, which played an important role in innate and adaptive immunity[20]. Previous studies have found higher percentages of SARS-CoV-1 infection in male mice than in female mice and provided mechanistic insights related to estrogen[21]. Additionally, 17 \u03b2-estradiol could down-regulate lung ACE2 mRNA, the putative receptor of SARS-CoV-2[4], and protect females from influenza A virus pathogenesis[22].",

In this study, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids or blood of 40 patients suspected of co-infection with bacteria and fungi during hospital admission were collected for traditional culture detection. Since the samples were collected 3 to 5 days after patients admitted to hospital, the bacteria and fungi detected were more likely to be secondary to COVID-19. And we found 45% cases (18/40) infected with single bacterial or fungi and 5% cases (2/40) were infected with two and more species of bacterial and fungi. The rate of bacterial/fungal co-infection was higher than that previously reported[13, 15]. On the one hand, the number of samples in this study may be small, on the other hand, all the samples were collected and tested when patients suspected of co-infection with bacteria and fungi combined with the results of CT and infection markers. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that human metapneumovirus and other viruses can be detected from SARS-CoV-1 patients[23, 24], and one case co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and human metapneumovirus was reported[14]. However, only 1 case was infected with boca virus in 79 patients detected of 13 respiratory pathogens. These issues demonstrate that susceptibility to co-infection with other viruses may be reduced in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Additionally, for the samples were collected and tested 3 to 5 days after patients admitted to hospital, the viruses co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be cured.",
