Each agency has its own roles and responsibilities, its own procedures, language, reporting formats, and so on, but the management of a large adverse event requires all involved to work together as a team. The command post team typically comprises officers representing Emergency Medical Services (EMS), specialist police officers, and hazardous materials (\u201chazmat\u201d) technicians, who belong to a special branch of the firefighting services, as well as an event manager. Depending on the nature and scope of the event, the event manager may be a police officer, a hazmat technician, or, in the case of a major rapidly spreading infectious disease outbreak such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, a public health authority.",

If, for example, a suspicious package or backpack with unknown contents has been detected in a public area, the bomb technician and hazmat technician may send in a robot to help in the investigation before allowing people into the hot zone. These robots are equipped with remotely controllable equipment, including mobile video cameras and tools with which to take samples of any chemicals to help identify the offending agent without endangering first responders. The Forensic Identification Specialist (called FIS or \u201cIdent\u201d) sends his staff into the hot zone once the area has been rendered safe, to collect evidence for a possible subsequent court case. As the interval between the occurrence of an event and the case going to court is often several years, all items found in the hot zone must be given an ID, be photographed, and packaged in several layers of sealed plastic bags for storage. The FIS officer signs each bag as he seals it. If for any reason the item is removed before the court case, it is resealed and the relevant officer again signs each bag. A radiofrequency ID (RFID) tag attached to each exhibit enables the police to retrieve all evidence associated with a given event once the court case goes ahead.",

Together with information about the nature and extent of injuries of people in the hot zone, which the EMS first responders report to their team leader, this information is passed to other members of the hazmat team, located in special fire trucks equipped with a plethora of online and printed resources. Their role is to identify the agent as quickly as possible and communicate their findings to the command post team leader. The team leader decides on the level of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that everyone in the hot/warm zones must wear and on the decontamination agent to be used. PPE may involve impervious full body suits, gas masks, heavy boots, and gloves. The team leader also controls the entry into and exit from the hot zone to ensure that only authorized personnel is present. The firefighters decontaminate everyone exiting from the hot zone.",

            "text": "To generate user requirements for each target user population, our team had prepared a fictitious but plausible scenario (Rosson & Carroll, 2001) for each type of CBRNE event. The explosion scenario, for example, read as follows:A few minutes ago on the 10AM CBC radio1, you heard news of a terrifying accident in Montr\u00e9al's Central station. The magnitude of the disaster is not yet known. It is unclear if a highly toxic gas has been accumulating in the city's ageing sewerage system that runs underneath the railway net, or if it is an act of terrorism. Members of the public have apparently been complaining about extremely foul smells in the streets of Old Montr\u00e9al around that area for over two weeks. However, because garbage handlers have been on strike for the past four weeks, the accumulating garbage in the streets was believed to be the source of the smells. According to the report, a series of at least five deafening explosions occurred in rapid succession around 9:52AM. At least two buses are on fire; the station is apparently in ruins, and it is not known how many passenger trains may also have been hit by the blast. No information is as yet available about the number of casualties.Jeremy Hall, the Mayor of Montr\u00e9al, is on the line requesting your immediate assistance. Having recently provided funding to install the MedPost system in two of the city-owned hospitals, Mr. Hall is aware of your involvement in its development as well as of your expertise at handling major disasters in Canada and abroad. MedPost has not been fully implemented yet, but Mr. Hall believes it may be possible to use a limited version of it to help monitor the situation. This limited version, which is intended for training medical staff, is capable of tracking up to five types of data selectable from a wider range, but no one in Montr\u00e9al knows which data types will be most valuable for managing the situation efficiently, perhaps using a mixture of electronic and manual data tracking. They are also unsure as to what can, and what must be, reported to whom, when, and how often. What would you advise?\n",

Therefore, they had produced quite pretty-looking Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages even though none of us knew much about the roles of the different players before the day-long session. Yet, no sooner had the users \u2014 in this case, experts who had collaboratively managed the SARS event in 2003 \u2014 read the above scenario than they began to act out their respective roles with such an intense urgency and sense of realism that they seemed to have forgotten the artificiality of the situation. No attention whatsoever was paid to the HTML pages displayed on the wall. Perhaps the most important lesson we learned was the kinds of information to which different users must not have access. To keep the Minister of Health and the media informed on progress and prevent accidental information leaks about individual casualties, their present whereabouts, their condition, or any names of people affected, these users must not have access to such detailed information. They see aggregate data only, such as the total number of cases, the number of new cases since the last briefing, the number of suspected and confirmed cases, and the number of deaths believed to be attributable to the event. The coroners' role includes distributing casualties among the surrounding hospitals. The number of patients with severe burns, for example, turned out to be an extremely important item of information for them because there are only eight burns beds in Montr\u00e9al. Before these are filled, information must therefore be obtained about vacant burns beds in hospitals in other cities. Our very first, very crude mock-up HTML draft of the summary screen, which was subsequently shown to the domain experts for comment, is presented in Figure 7.2\n. As new information becomes available, the data is automatically updated in MedPost. Two updates are shown, with the most recent report shown next to the relevant field header. Thus the total number of cases (casualties) increased from 17 to 25 in the period 10:20-10:57. Eight new cases had been identified in the intervening period. The user can see when either the minister or the press was last notified, making it easy to focus on the most important data\u2014presented first\u2014namely the total number of cases and the number of new cases since the last report was received. Because the users were able to act out their roles in such detail, the summary screen hardly changed as the design of the application matured. Save for the look and feel of the final application, the content of this crude first prototype for this user population of which the screen in Figure 7.1 is a part remained virtually unchanged.",

However, unlike the infection control nurse, who also needs access to patients' names and home addresses, the epidemiologist cannot see those specific details.

We were able to observe several CBRNE simulations to gather user requirements and in a user-based prototype test. The scenarios given to responders upon arrival at the scene were always prepared by the event organizers, police, or fire chiefs. Researchers thus had no control over the nature, scope, or content of the scenario, and nor was the user test in any way under our control. The first simulation included five command post team leaders: two EMS officers, one bomb technician, one FIS, and one hazmat technician as well as several teams of first responders representing all three agencies, and over 20 stadium employees acting as casualties. Five HCI researchers, each equipped with a digital video camera, a still camera, an audio recorder, and note paper, observed and recorded activities in the command post throughout the event in which we derived user requirements for PROBE.",

Since we are not domain experts in any of the agencies' fields, this was very valuable; several misunderstandings on our part were identified that had led to misinterpretation, and hence to an unjustified user requirement. These were corrected before coding commenced on the advanced prototype. In the end, however, we only needed data obtained in the first half of the event, when responders and team leaders were making sense of the situation. Once they had identified the chemical agent they were dealing with, the number of casualties and types of injuries had been determined, and decontamination was proceeding, the management process settled into a routine that did not require much system support.

Our task is therefore to provide prototypes to assist with the UI design and to run usability evaluations. The user requirements stretch over many pages of very detailed items. Two important lessons have been learned so far in this project. First, the concept of a \u201cprototype\u201d varied considerably among members of the project team, and constraints included the need to work with specific development tools that impose a particular UI style or look and feel. Therefore, even our early prototypes were assessed against the very specific requirements, leaving very little room for \u201cthinking outside the UI design box\u201d. The second important lesson was that, for this user population, vocabulary, images, and content of the prototypes must precisely match reality and hence the users' rather specific expectations even of an initial low-fidelity prototype. Thus, when turning up to run an extensive, very early prototype pen/paper-based usability test in which we had expected up to 40 participants at a symposium held for first responders from around the country, we were unable to run the test. This was due to concerns with the inaccuracy especially of the images of bomb materials that we had found on the Internet. One screen displaying some of those images is shown in Figure 7.4\n. This, we were told, would turn the users right off and thus negatively affect eventual user acceptance of the eventual application.",

Therefore, be aware of, and respect, your target users' expectations and the level of seriousness they place on even high-level early prototypes.\u2022\nThis authenticity concerns text, terminology, and images. If you cannot obtain authentic high-quality images, use high-level abstractions to represent these instead.\u2022\nPeople are better at acting out their roles than at talking about them. Therefore, when writing usage scenarios, make sure you represent your users' reality as closely as possible, enabling them to act out their roles early in the requirements capture stage. Make sure also that you adjust the usage scenarios to each user population.\u2022\nOccasionally, certain users should not be able to access particular items of information. This is especially important if you are designing a time/safety/mission critical application, as sensitive information could inadvertently be leaked by people who should not know details that are irrelevant to their roles and responsibilities.\u2022\nRecord and analyze data only in the first half of a CBRNE or other crisis simulation. By far, most activity takes place at the beginning of a response to a crisis, when the responders are trying to piece together a coherent picture of the type and magnitude of an unfolding event. Once they know what they are dealing with, they go into a routine response mode in which they can rely on their knowledge and experience.\u2022\nReconstruct minute-to-minute parts of an adverse event from data transcriptions originating in several files. By collating all data from different media and possibly from different researchers into one master data file, everyone will have the same picture. When extracting user requirements from that file, keep a reference to the point in time at which the observation was made that led you to articulate the requirement. This greatly facilitates the user requirements reviews with all stakeholders and helps to correct any misunderstandings.\u2022\nSelect the episodes in the event that are worthy of detailed analysis. It is easier to select the best data from smaller sections. Therefore, divide the event data into smaller sections and then perform a quick tally of the relative amount of relevant verbal activity in each section to help select the best data to analyze. When an event stretches over many hours, it may not be necessary to analyze all verbal episodes to generate useful requirements.\u2022\nEliminate all unrelated conversations and statements from the data file, but calculate the percentage of such conversations. An indication of the amount of irrelevant conversation among the event response management team can provide information about the level of stress in the team and hence about the difficulty of their task. The more taxing the task is, the fewer irrelevant conversational episodes are likely to occur.\n",

We selected episodes that stood out to us as requiring a somewhat different approach to that we would typically adopt when designing UIs for people whose daily work does not involve serious threats to human safety. In MedPost, we were surprised to discover the power of the scenario for revealing details of the experts' roles and responsibilities that rendered the UI design a very easy task. In particular, it was interesting to note the importance of knowing which items of information should not be accessible to some users. In PROBE, we had underestimated the value of linking each user requirement to particular points in the minute-by-minute verbalizations captured in the master data file of the event. In the XIT prototype, we were quite taken aback by the importance to users of including authentic images to illustrate how an image-based search might work. Although these lessons were learned in the specific context of designing UIs for supporting the management of CBRNE events, we believe that they are generalizable to other types of projects.",
