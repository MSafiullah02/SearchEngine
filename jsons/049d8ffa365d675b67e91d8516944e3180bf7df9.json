Among them, Th1 cells, which are induced by IL-12 and produce large quantities of IFN-\u03b3, are involved in enhancing the clearance of certain intracellular pathogens, including viruses [10, 11] . Besides, CD8 + T cells restricted by class I major histocompatibility complex molecules are important in establishing immunity to influenza virus because they recognize internal viral proteins that are conserved between multiple viral strains [12] . Both CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells are critical in defending against influenza viruses [13] [14] [15] . Since the sequence of the new coronavirus is highly homologous to SARS and MERS virus [16, 17] , both of which are severe respiration viruses, probably that CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells are also responsible for controlling the new coronavirus. Here, we have shown that the reduction of those populations is associated with the enhancement of the severity of patients with the COVID-19.

Nowadays, it is common to use glucocorticoid [20] or specific neutralization antibodies to fight against cytokine storms [21] . The former causes a lot of complications while the latter is costly [22] . It has been proposed that immuno-modulatory therapy may prevent cytokine storms [14] . Here, we proposed that enhancing T cell populations or improving their functions through medical features or diet may deter the disease from getting worse. Our results further support the concept that boosting your immunity is effective in dealing with viruses [23, 24] .",
