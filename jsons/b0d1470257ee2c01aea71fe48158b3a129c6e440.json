Numerous studies from Europe and North America have shown that GNB are not a common aetiology 1,2 and a significant prevalence mainly affects high-risk populations. [1] [2] [3] Although limited, previous studies from Asia indicate that GNB is a more common cause of CAP, particularly in Southeast Asia. 4, 5 Initial antibiotic treatment for CAP is empiric. First-line treatment recommendations mainly target Streptococcus pneumoniae, the major causative pathogen in most parts of the world. 6 While GNB have repeatedly been associated with severe disease presentation and adverse prognosis, 1,2,7 the choice of appropriate antibiotic treatment in CAP is further complicated by the emergence of multidrug resistance among GNB, particularly in Asia, since excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for common infections can be harmful. 8 It is therefore important to define the frequency of GNB in CAP in Southeast Asia and to identify risk factors to provide support for clinicians in determining which patients merit deviation from the advocated first-line antibiotic therapy.",

The study hospitals were located in Takeo province (estimated population 0.9 million) and Kampong Cham province (estimated population 1.7 million), both located approximately 150 km from the capital. The participating hospitals could provide supplementary oxygen, but mechanical or non-invasive ventilation and computed tomography (CT) scan were unavailable. Details of patient recruitment and the methodology have been described elsewhere. 9 Patients were eligible if admitted to hospital with symptoms of acute lower respiratory tract infection, defined as onset \u226414 d, fever \u226538\u00b0C or a history of febrile episodes within 3 days and cough and at least one respiratory sign (dyspnoea, chest pain or crackles on lung auscultation) without any hospitalization in the previous 3 weeks and without any known tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active cancer. The decision to hospitalize was left to the clinicians' judgement. The study was approved by the Cambodian National Ethics Committee for Health Research (024-NECHR). Written informed consent was obtained from patients \u226518 y of age or the parents/guardians of children. In the present study we included individuals \u226515 y of age (the age cut-off for admission to adult wards in Cambodia) with radiological and clinical signs compatible with CAP.",

This is likely an underestimation of the true incidence, since the proportion of GNB reached 15.8% in the population with a valid respiratory sample. Data from Cambodia are scarce. In line with our findings, however, previous studies from neighbouring countries in Asia have in general reported a high frequency of GNB regardless of age. A recent systematic review of CAP aetiology based on 48 studies from Asian countries other than Cambodia found an overall proportion of 13% in hospitalized patients. In Southeast Asia, the proportion was even higher, ranging from 14 to 27%. 15 Although the reasons for the increased frequency of GNB are not fully understood, it can be explained in part by the contribution of B. pseudomallei (agent of melioidosis)-a highly pathogenic, still underrecognized agent of severe pneumonia that is endemic in Southeast Asia 16,17 -and the presumed high prevalence of a particularly virulent mucoid phenotype of K. pneumoniae that is prone to cause invasive disease. 18, 19 K. pneumoniae has been shown to be among the most frequent CAP pathogens in all age groups. 20-23 However, we and others have also found a high proportion of other GNB, such as P. aeruginosa, E. coli and A. baumannii. 24, 25 Many GNB are found in soil and humid environments. The higher incidence of GNB in CAP might therefore reflect effects of climate conditions or exposure to an environmental reservoir analogous to B. pseudomallei. 4 We are aware of very few publications on the GNB nasopharyngeal carriage rate. One recent study from Indonesia reports a GNB carriage rate of 30%. 26 Two older studies comparing developing and developed countries found significant differences: 36-57% vs 4-9%, respectively. 27, 28 It has been hypothesized that the widespread use of antibiotics (proper or substandard drugs) in Asian countries could bias the incidence estimates, since prior antibiotic use promotes colonization by GNB. 15, 21 Prior antibiotic use or the use of counterfeit drugs can also favour selection of patients with GNB seeking medical care due to treatment failure. We found no statistical evidence of differences in GNB prevalence between the subgroups according to prior antibiotic treatment. However, half of our cohort reported treatment of unknown origin prior to inclusion. Misclassification due to unawareness of whether or not antibiotics had been used could have biased our estimates.",

A high degree of misclassification could therefore have biased estimates towards the null. Nevertheless, the prevalence of diabetes found in our study was in line with previous prevalence estimates from Cambodia. 29 Furthermore, due to the substantial financial burden hospitalization often imposes on the family, many families in Cambodia choose to bring the patient home if they cannot afford care or when the patient is severely ill with little hope of recovery. 17 The present study was based on Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene hospitalized cases of CAP, which could have biased our cohort towards previously healthy and younger age groups. While some previous studies have identified underlying pulmonary disease as a risk factor for GNB in CAP, 2,30 others have not. 1, 7 A large proportion of our cohort had an underlying pulmonary condition. The most frequent pathogens in this group were H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, regardless of whether the underlying condition was bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis/asthma. Alcohol consumption was mainly associated with S. pneumoniae in our study. 7 Several GNB have been shown to cause necrotic pulmonary infections and cavitary lesions on the chest X-ray. 17, 19 Even with the large proportion of TB cases in our cohort-a well-known phenomenon in countries with a high burden of TB-we did not observe an association with GNB. Importantly, when excluding AFB-positive patients, cavitation was significantly associated with GNB aetiology. Thus if direct sputum examination is negative, the likelihood of GNB is high in patients with cavitary lesions on the chest X-ray.",

Inferences about disease outcomes such as death were limited by the large proportion of patients with missing information due to transfer to other health care units. Despite this limitation, our results support previous findings that GNB are associated with worse outcome. Since the ascertainment of comorbidities was insufficient and AST information was lacking for a large proportion of our cohort, we cannot conclude whether the excess mortality could be attributed to the GNB pathogens, to differences in underlying health status or to inappropriate antibiotic treatment.",

First, 28% of the patients with GNB were bacteraemic. Second, specimens were prospectively collected prior to any antibiotic treatment at the hospital. Third, only validated sputum was sent for culture and we used a cut-off of 10 7 cfu/ml of original sputum. Our study was based on prospectively collected information from two separate geographical regions over a 3-y period. We therefore believe the results are generalizable to the general population in Cambodia.",

Prospective clinical trials comparing empiric treatment algorithms according to the severity of CAP are therefore urgently needed. Given the complex situation, microbiological laboratory capacity needs to be increased and blood and sputum culturing in CAP should be encouraged.",
