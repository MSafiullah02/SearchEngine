The empirical evidence is generally positive but mixed, and almost exclusively focuses on U.S. data. Using several distinct commodity indexes over the period 1993-2019, we investigate the case of an investor in Canada, a commodity-currency country where equities are already exposed to commodity beta. We use spanning tests and several outof-sample performance measures for both risk-averse and disappointment-averse investors. Overall, we find that while the diversification potential of commodities was limited in Canada before and during financialization, the post-financialization period offers new opportunities. The evidence suggests that portfolio performance is significantly improved using some, but not all, commodity indexes. Thus, the choice of a relevant commodity index matters as a vehicle for diversification. Finally, compounding an international component to the sectorial diversification of the portfolio can significantly improve its performance.",

Adding energy commodities may lower risk for a commodity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f portfolio in the post-financial crisis period (Rehman et al., 2019) . However, indexes that are energy-light or focused on metals perform better for U.S. investors over 1983-2013 than do indexes that load more on energy or agricultural commodities (Bessler and Wolff, 2014) . While precious metals reduce downside risk, they may also lower the portfolio's Sharpe ratios (Bredin, Conlon and Poti, 2017) .

Let , be the monthly average of the RNTC sample of the strategy with the expanded and restricted investment opportunity, respectively, and , be the corresponding standard deviations. Then, the return-loss measure is given by: This is also true for the Commodity Currency Index. The evidence we report is therefore consistent with previous studies, and confirms that commodity indices taken alone underperform other asset classes (e.g., Jensen, Johnson, and Mercer, 2000) . With the exception of the Bloomberg Commodity Index and the Bank of Canada Commodity Ex Energy Index, we reject at the 5% level the null hypothesis that returns are normally distributed (using the Jarque-Bera test). Comparing the U.S. and Canadian trends in indexes underscores the differences between the two markets and further justifies our analysis. Figure 2 further shows, from a Canadian and U.S. perspective, the evolution of the main indices during two sub-periods of interest. Indeed, for the period from January 2005 to June 2008, Daskalaki and Skiadopoulos (2015) conclude that adding commodities to a U.S. investor's portfolio is profitable. This result is not surprising since this period is the longest and the strongest commodity bull cycle since the Second World War (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and Marone, 2008) . This is clearly seen in Panel B. Turning to the Canadian market, the S&P TSX has generally outperformed commodity indices. But given the significant presence of the commodities sector in Canada, the impact of a commodities boom is not the same for the Canadian and U.S. economies. As the Canadian dollar appreciates, this mitigates the impact of the boom. Indeed, prices in the domestic currency increase less than do world prices, the profitability of the export sector increases less than expected, and thus domestic consumers benefit from the appreciation in the form of cheap imports.

Indeed, the results suggest that it is better to turn to international diversification at the same time as adding commodities, and that is what the Bloomberg (BCOM) index offers.

The global financial crisis period also shows positive return-loss measures, but gains desappear with disappointment aversion A=0.6. These findings lend support to the main results, as investors benefit more from commodities in the most recent sub-period, post financiarisation (2008-2019P), and for longer windows. Using the Bank of Canada index yields consistently worse performance, except during the global financial crisis for the index excluding the energy sector.

This translates into better diversification potential in the third sub-period we study (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) (2018) (2019) . This improved diversification in the post financialization sup-period also translates into a reasonable diversification potential using commodities during the global financial crisis. Therefore, not only are commodities back in style, but our evidence suggest that they may offer some diversification against economic turmoil, suggesting a safe-haven characteristic sometimes associated with commodities (see e.g., Miffre and Fernandez-Perez, 2015) . Our results also suggest that, in general, commodity-linked improvements in terms of Sharpe ratios decrease with the investor's level of risk aversion. This finding is in line with recent evidence presented in Lin and Zhang (2019) and Cai et al. (2020) . Thus, our results are most relevant for investors with a lower relative risk aversion, who have the most to gain.",

In terms of country J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f diversification, our results suggest that a lighter loading in the energy sector (which tends to be pro-cyclical) provides some diversification during the global financial crisis.",

In our results, we find that the Morningstar commodity currency index improves on the efficient frontier, while regular commodity indexes do not. Furthermore, the U.S. commodity index has better out-of-sample performance than the Canadian commodity index. These results are especially relevant for more sophisticated investors, who are not constrained by the same investment set as institutional investors, and who can profit from the current diversification potential of commodities despite their volatility and strong cycles. Table 2 presents the Wald test statistics and respective values for the null hypothesis: the mean-variance frontier of the reference assets increased by the test asset coincides with the reference asset boundary only. The results are based on monthly observations from February 1993 to April 2019. In each period, the MV spanning hypothesis (eq. 5) and the non-MV spanning hypothesis (eq. 7) are tested separately. The non-MV spanning test is done with a power utility function and use different levels of risk aversion coefficients (RRA = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) and a subjective annualized discount factor of 0.95. The reference assets consist of the S&P/TSX Composite Index, the S&P Canada Aggregate Bond Total Return Index and the Bank of Canada's 1-month commercial paper rate. All test statistics are based on a Newey-West covariance matrix with five offsets. One, two and three stars indicate significance at the level of 10%, 5% or 1% respectively.

The null hypothesis is that the SR obtained from the set of traditional investment opportunities is equal to that derived from the augmented set of commodities. The results are reported for different rolling window sizes (K = 36, 60, 72 observations) and different relative risk aversion degrees (RRA = 2, 6, 10). Investors have access to commodity investments through the Morningstar Commodity Currency Index TR (MCC). Results are based on monthly observations from February 1993 to April 2019 and prices are in Canadian dollars. One, two and three stars indicate that annualized SR is statistically significantly different at the level of 10%, 5% or 1% respectively.

As for policymakers, our results suggest paying particular attention to interest rates, as diversification benefits increase in low rate environments.
