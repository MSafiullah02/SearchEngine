Although diagnosing RTIs requires a syndromic approach because symptoms of respiratory viruses infection overlap, only few rapid tests currently available can simultaneously detect multiple viruses. Most rapid tests solely detect influenza viruses or RSV. This is historically understandable, because these viruses were considered the most important respiratory viruses. Furthermore, availability of antivirals for influenza renders rapid diagnostic testing of influenza of high priority.
