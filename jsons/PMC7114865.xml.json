The causative agent CAV-1 was isolated a decade later [4] and was attenuated through passages on canine and swine cell lines to produce vaccines [5], [6]. CAV-2 was first recovered in 1961 from dogs with laryngotracheitis [7]. The isolate, strain Toronto A26/61, was initially considered to be an attenuated strain of CAV-1; only subsequently was it proposed as the prototype of a distinct CAV designated as CAV-2 [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].",

CAV-1 replication in vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes produces acute necrohemorrhagic hepatitis, and the disease is more severe in young animals [28], [29]. Transmission occurs through animal-to-animal contact or indirectly through exposure to infectious saliva, feces, urine, or respiratory secretions. CAV-1 is shed in urine up to 6 to 9 months after infection [30]. The incubation period in dogs is 4 to 6 days after ingestion of infectious material and 6 to 9 days after direct contact with infected dogs [31]. The mortality rate is 10% to 30% [32]. Coinfections with canine coronavirus (CCoV) [33], [34], canine distemper virus (CDV) [34], [35], [36], [37], or canine parvovirus [34] can exacerbate the disease, increasing the mortality rates.",

Dogs displaying a second peak of hyperthermia frequently undergo a more severe form of ICH. Commonly observed symptoms are depression, loss of appetite, increased heart rate, hyperventilation, vomiting, and diarrhea. Abdominal pain and distention can occur as a result of accumulation of serosanguineous or hemorrhagic fluid and enlargement of the liver. Frequently, hemorrhagic diathesis is observed with epistaxis, congestion, or hemorrhage of the mucous membranes and skin. Respiratory distress can also be observed as a consequence of laryngitis, tracheitis, and, less frequently, pneumonia. Neurologic signs (hypersalivation, ataxia, and seizures) are rare in dogs and are associated with vascular damage in the central nervous system (CNS) [28], [38]. Corneal opacity (\u201cblue eye\u201d;\nFig. 1) and interstitial nephritis may occur 1 to 3 weeks after recovery because of deposition of immune complexes [39], [40], [41]. Hematologic findings include leukopenia (<2000 cells/\u03bcL of blood; mainly attributable to a decrease in neutrophil count), increase in the serum transaminases (only in the severe forms of disease) [42], and coagulation disorders associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC; thrombocytopenia, altered platelet formation, and prolonged prothrombin time) [43]. Proteinuria (albuminuria) can easily reach values greater than 50 mg/dL because of immunomediated glomerulonephritis [29].",

Kennel cough is typically a complex of diseases caused by viral pathogens (eg, CAVs, CHV, canine parainfluenza virus, reoviruses) in association with bacteria, mainly B bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma spp. Most frequently, a dry hacking cough is observed as a consequence of an uncomplicated, self-limiting, and primarily viral infection of the trachea and bronchi. In complicated forms, which are more common in pups and immunocompromised dogs, secondary bacterial infections and involvement of pulmonary tissue overlap the viral infection. Cough is usually associated with mucoid discharges. The condition may progress to bronchopneumonia and, in the most severe instances, death [61]. Usually, CNS involvement is not seen, although death in pups with neurologic disease associated with CAV-2 infection has been reported [62].",

Postmortem findings and histopathologic changes are highly suggestive of CAV-1 infection. Confirmation of a diagnosis of ICH is obtained by virus isolation on permissive cell lines, such as Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol has recently been developed for molecular diagnosis [69]. Ocular swabs, feces, and urine can be collected in vivo for virus isolation and PCR. Postmortem samples can be withdrawn from the kidney, lung, and lymphoid tissues. The liver is rich in arginase, which inhibits viral growth in cell cultures [70], but it represents the most important organ for histopathologic examination [28], [29]. Viral growth in cells is revealed by rounding cells that form clusters and detach from the monolayers [34]. Immunofluorescence (IF) can detect viral antigens in infected cell cultures and in acetone-fixed tissue sections or smears. Viral replication can also be demonstrated by detection of nuclear inclusion bodies in the cells after hematoxylin-eosin staining.",

Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on viral genomes using the endonucleases PstI and HpaII generates differential patterns [17], [18]. Detection and differentiation of CAV-1 and CAV-2 by PCR with a single primer pair are also possible [69]. Although CAVs agglutinate erythrocytes of several species, hemagglutination is not used in routine diagnosis [71]. Because most dogs are vaccinated and CAV-2 infection is frequent in dogs, serology has low diagnostic relevance [21], [39].",

CAV-1\u2013based modified-live virus (MLV) vaccines proved to be highly effective but were associated with interstitial nephritis and corneal opacity [22]. Administration of CAV-1 in conjunction with CDV vaccines was also associated with postvaccinal encephalitis [73]. Because CAV-1 and CAV-2 are able to confer cross-protection, the current vaccines contain MLV CAV-2, which is not able to induce renal or ocular damage. The CAV-2 attenuated strain Toronto A26/61 is contained in most vaccine formulations [22], [74]. In the absence of maternally derived antibodies (MDAs), a single dose administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly is protective against ICH and ITB. Because of the possible interference of MDAs, however, the vaccination schedule requires administration of at least two vaccine doses at a 3- to 4-week interval, starting when pups are 8 to 10 weeks old. Intranasal administration of an MLV CAV-2 vaccine has been proposed to overcome MDA interference, but it may be associated with the onset of mild respiratory disease [29].",

At the moment, there are few data on the molecular epidemiology of CAVs, but it is commonly accepted that vaccine breaks occur rarely with CAV vaccines, because the viruses are genetically stable. Accordingly, CAV infection in vaccinated dogs has been associated with MDA interference in the early life of the pups rather than with emergence of variants genetically distant from the prototype strains contained in CAV-2 vaccines [34].",
