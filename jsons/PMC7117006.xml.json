            "text": "The cosmopolitan protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum infects humans and a range of other hosts, and is a common agent of calf diarrhea during the first four weeks of life (Gulliksen et al., 2009, Lanz Uhde et al., 2008, Millemann, 2009, Trotz-Williams et al., 2005). The spectrum of severity of cryptosporidiosis in calves varies from subclinical infection to severe diarrhea and dehydration (Fayer et al., 1998, Klein et al., 2008, O\u2019Handley et al., 1999). Typically, natural and experimental infections with C. parvum in calves have a pre-patent period of 3\u20136 days, followed by a patent period characterized by a bell-shaped oocyst excretion curve, with the number of fecal oocysts peaking and then rapidly decreasing to undetectable levels in a matter of 7\u201314 days (Fayer et al., 1998, Grinberg et al., 2002). Oocyst numbers as high as 107 oocysts per gram of feces have been reported at the peak of excretion (Fayer et al., 1998, Grinberg et al., 2002). Whereas infection rates as high as 100% have been reported in calves in the first month of life, a lower infection prevalence has been consistently observed in weaned animals (Bartels et al., 2010, Brook et al., 2008, Fayer and Xiao, 2008, Fayer et al., 2000, Garber et al., 1994). Newborn calves are therefore considered major amplifiers of potentially zoonotic C. parvum in nature, and the prevention of calf cryptosporidiosis is relevant from both animal and human health perspectives (Hunter and Thompson, 2005, Kiang et al., 2006, Smith et al., 2007, Grinberg et al., 2008, Xiao and Feng, 2008, Zhou et al., 2008).",

Calves can excrete hundreds of millions of oocysts (Naciri et al., 1999, Grinberg et al., 2002), and considering there is a high probability of infection with a dose as low as 50 oocysts (Moore et al., 2003), an infected calf could produce enough oocysts to infect thousands of new animals. Attempts to interrupt the transmission of C. parvum should therefore include the immediate isolation of every infected animal, but this is rarely feasible on commercial farms. In addition, the C. parvum oocysts are insensitive to the action of numerous disinfectants (Chen et al., 2002, Quilez et al., 2005) and are excreted sporulated and fully infectious (Smith et al., 2005), requiring daily cleaning for their removal. Therefore, in the absence of effective immunizing agents, pharmacological control strategies remain central for the prevention of cryptosporidiosis in calves.",

HL is a synthetic derivative of a quinazolinone alkaloid with cryptosporidiostatic activity, but a mode of action that is poorly characterized. In naturally and experimentally infected calves, the oral administration of 60 \u03bcg/kg HL for seven consecutive days from the first day of life delays the onset of oocyst shedding, reduces the number of oocysts excreted, and lowers the severity of diarrhea (Jarvie et al., 2005, Joachim et al., 2003, Klein, 2008, Lefay et al., 2001, Trotz-Williams et al., 2011, Villacorta et al., 1991). A formulation containing HL (Halocur, Intervet Ltd., Republic of Ireland) is currently the only prescription drug registered for the prevention of cryptosporidiosis of calves in several countries. The use of HL has a number of limitations, including a substantial market price and a narrow therapeutic index, with toxicity observable at approximately twice the recommended dose (Villacorta et al., 1991, Naciri et al., 1993, Trotz-Williams et al., 2005; http://www.msd-animal-health.co.uk/products_public/halocur/090_product_datasheet.aspx, accessed 15 July 2012).",

Indeed, with some exceptions (Klein, 2008, Lefay et al., 2001), most anti-Cryptosporidium efficacy studies of HL did not analyze or took into account the presence of co-infections. Co-infections might modify the anti-Cryptosporidium effect of HL in different ways. The increased fluid content and intestinal motility determined by the presence of co-infecting pathogens may reduce the activity of HL by dilution, or by reducing the transit time of the drug in the intestinal tract. Furthermore, enteric infection with rotavirus or other agents may cause exfoliation of infected cells, altering intestinal cellular function (Ramig, 2004), potentially increasing the toxicity of HL via systemic absorption.",

The initial aim was to assess the preventive efficacy of half the recommended dose of HL as compared with the full dose and no treatment, and the following treatment groups were established: Group 1 (full dose regime; n\n = 15), calves treated orally with 8 ml Halocur; Group 2 (half dose regime; n\n = 15), calves treated with 4 ml Halocur; Group 3 (placebo control group; n\n = 15), calves treated with 4 ml water delivered using the product's dispenser. The group sizes were estimated using power analysis for the detection of a difference between means, using PASS software (NCSS, Kaysville, UT). Assumptions for the calculations were a log10-transformed mean number of oocysts per gram of feces of 4.3 for the full dose and 6.2 for the untreated-control group at the peak of shedding, and a common standard deviation of 1.2. These means were estimated from a previously published study of efficacy of paromomycin sulphate (Grinberg et al., 2002). Group sizes of 8 calves per group achieved 84% power to reject the null hypothesis that both group means are 6.2. Thus, assuming a conservative infection rate of \u223c50%, 15 calves per group were required.",

Then the newborns were transferred to a large shed and allocated to a pen for newborn calves, of a capacity of about 10 calves. Calves were left in this pen for 2\u20133 days and then transferred to a new pen, in order to create space for new calves in the first pen. Subsequently, the calves progressed to new pens (often adjacent) containing 5\u201310 animals of the same age group every 2\u20133 days, until weaning. The allocation of calves to pens was done by caretakers who were not aware of the nature of the treatments given to each calf, effectively creating a commingled pen design. Adjacent pens were separated by slatted wooden fences. Sawdust was used as bedding material. The feeding regimen included the administration of complete commercial milk replacement for the first two weeks using a tank with multiple nipples, followed by feeding ad libitum using automatic feeders until weaning. Roughage was available from the second week of life. No routine vaccinations, preventive treatments or supplementations were administered to the calves during the study. However, inappetent calves could be tube-fed and severely diarrheic calves treated with oral electrolytes and/or other treatments by the caretakers. Severely sick calves were transferred to an isolation shed. The study protocol stipulated that the tube fed calves could continue in the study, but animals treated by the farmer other means or transferred to the isolation pen, were removed.",

The apple-green fluorescent oocysts present on the entire area of the stained drop were counted using a fluorescent microscope using an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and a 200\u00d7 magnification lens. This total number of oocysts (TON) on the slide was used for statistical analysis (see below). Samples containing >1000 oocysts were difficult to count and were re-processed by a further dilution of the fecal suspension at 10\u22121 in water, followed by the staining of a 10 \u03bcl drop as above. The TON present on each re-diluted specimen was estimated by multiplying the result by 10. When the available fecal material was insufficient for counting, a direct fecal smear was stained and a qualitative result (presence/absence of oocysts) was obtained. These qualitative results could not be used for the statistical comparison of the number of oocysts between the treatment groups, but were used for any comparison between proportions of Cryptosporidium-positive and negative specimens.",

The parasitological effects were analyzed by comparing the TONs between the groups using an analysis of variance for repeated measurements (rmANOVA) implemented by the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS (Statistical Analysis System, 2001, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). TONs were log-transformed as log10 (TON + 1) and analyzed using mixed models. The first model (Model 1) included the fixed effects of treatment (variable \u2018treatment Group\u2019), the day of sampling as repeated factor (variable \u2018sampling Day\u2019), and the interaction of treatment Group and sampling Day. Model 2 included the fixed effects as in Model 1 plus the fixed effect of sex of the calves, and Model 3 included the same factors as in Model 2 plus the effect of breed of the calves as a co-variable (variable \u2018Breed\u2019; Friesian calf = 1; non-Friesian calf = 0). Fixed effects for variable Breed were not included as a class due to unbalanced designs deriving from the uneven distribution of breeds across treatments. Finally, Model 4 was similar to Model 2, but did not include the data obtained from non-Freisian calves, effectively removing any variability due to the breed. All the models included the random effect of calf, to account for the within-calf variability. Using the Akaike's information criterion, an unstructured error structure was determined as the most appropriate residual covariance structure for repeated measures over time, within animals. Finally, the parasitological efficacy was also assessed by comparing the decline of the proportion of parasitologically negative calves as a function of time between the three groups using the non-parametric Kaplan\u2013Meier method (KM) (Kaplan and Meier, 1958). Also in this case, the analysis was repeated after omitting all the data from the non-Friesian calves. The KM analysis was implemented using a code available in \u201cR\u201d (Terry Therneau, 2012; A Package for Survival Analysis in R package version 2.36-14).",

Thirty eight calves (84.5%) were followed up for the entire observation period, and seven (15.5%) died at different stages during the study.

Two calves (Group 1 and Group 3) died from improper tube-feeding (possibly, milk inhalation) on Day 7 and Day 13.

The co-infections with rotavirus and Salmonella Typhimurium did not affect the ability of HL (full dose) to delay the onset of shedding. Whereas most calves (5/12) in Group 1 were still shedding oocysts on Day 20, the majority of the calves in the control group were already parasitologically negative by that day (Table 2). The prolongation of the prepatent period was not coupled with statistically significant differences between the mean log10 (TON + 1) of the treatment Groups after controlling for the repeated measurements, the sex, and the breed of the calves (Models 3 and 4). We hypothesize that HL suppressed the parasite's life cycle during the first days of treatment, when the diarrhea caused by the other pathogens was not yet overt, effectively prolonging the prepatent period in Group 1. Conversely, about 30% of the calves in Group 1 were passing liquid feces on Day 6, and this early diarrhea (probably caused by the co-infecting pathogens) could have shortened the intestinal transit time of HL in the last days of treatment, effectively abolishing its anti-Cryptosporidium effect.",
