Our model incorporates the asymptomatic infected individuals, who represent the majority of the infected population (with symptoms or not) and could play an important role in spreading the virus without any knowledge. We calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) via the next-generation matrix method and estimate the per day infection, death and recovery rates. The local stability of the disease free equilibrium is established in terms of R 0 . A sensibility analysis is performed to determine the relative importance of the model parameters to the disease transmission. We calibrate the parameters of the SEIARD model to the reported number of infected cases and fatalities for several states in Mexico by minimizing the sum of squared errors and attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak until August 2020.",

The parameters of the mathematical model were fitted with the experimental data provided by a daily update from the Mexican Ministry of Health. By adjusting the data from the period from March 12, 2020 to April 28, 2020, we simulated the daily new COVID-19 cases in Mexico until August 2020. The peak of the infection modeled will be in the middle of May, with 13 000 infected individuals with the known developed symptoms and roughly 130 000 infected individuals that will not develop any kind of symptoms. The values of the best fit parameters are given in Table 1 . Figure 3 shows the variation of the infection rate \u03b2(t), recovery rate \u03b3(t) and death rate \u03b4(t) with respect to time. The infection rate decreases at a good pace with respect to time, taking roughly 90 days from March 12 to a near infection rate per day of 0, which means that from that day they will be no more new infected individuals. The recovery rate in Mexico at twenty days past March 12 is increasing, and past the 20th day the recovery rate becomes constant with respect to time. This type of behavior may be explained by the fact that, at first, there were only mild cases in Mexico. Then, by March 30 there were much more severe cases, which are associated with a death rate that remains roughly constant at a rate of 0.015 per day. Using these values for the parameters, we can calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio R d (t) for each day (see Figure 4 ) As we can see in Figure 4 , during March R d (t) decreases exponentially from 16 to 4, roughly, and it decreases from 4 to 2 during the month of April. The decrease from the first period is very helpful and Mexico will be entering a declared phase two of the pandemic with a relatively low reproduction number. We believe this decay may have occurred because the Ministry of Health applied the \"Jornada de Distanciamiento Social\" before Mexico declared to be in phase two.

The difference in the peak may be due to the separation of the capital of Morelos from Mexico City (86.6 km). Also, the connection between these states was cut off due to the confinement declared by the Ministry, which may be a reason for the difference between the outbreak of the infection in these states. Figure 10 shows the variation of the infection, recovery and death rates for the Mexico Valley. The rates between these states are different: Mexico City (the capital of Mexico, which has one of the two more important airports of the country) has a higher infection rate in the initial days of the simulation of our model by being close to 1. The death rate in Mexico City decreases considerably throughout the simulation, which means that this state may have less fatalities than other states in Mexico in the advanced stages of the outbreak. At the beginning, Morelos had a higher infection rate than Mexico City, but it decays later at roughly the same rate as Mexico City. At first the recovery rate in Morelos was very low and the death rate was high, this means that Morelos was impacted at first with severe cases.",

Regarding the daily reproduction number, Campeche and Quintana Roo (Figures 18A and 18B, respectively) will have the same behavior: by early April, both will have a value for R d (t) of 4 and they will enter phase two with a value smaller than 3. During the month of May, the reproduction number will become smaller than one. Yucatan has the same behavior, but the reproduction number will be smaller than one by early June, this state should evaluate how well they are staying at their houses to try to diminish R d (t) at the same velocity than the rest of the states of the Yucatan Peninsula. We thought Quintana Roo ( Figure 19B ) was going to have a higher number of infected individuals, but Yucatan will have much more than the other states ( Figure 19C ). Campeche will have slightly more than 800 infected individuals. The death toll will be higher in Quintana Roo ( Figure  20B ) and then Yucatan ( Figure 20C ). Alarmingly, in Campeche roughly 20 percent of the infected will die by complications product of COVID-19. This behavior is of great importance, but we cannot know in detail why this is happening in this state. Finally, we can see in Figure 22 the simulation of the symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, which shows that the Yucatan peninsula is indeed flattening the curve.",
