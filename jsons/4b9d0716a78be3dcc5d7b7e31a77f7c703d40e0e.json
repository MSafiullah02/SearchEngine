It is particularly efficient in cases where labeling the training data is expensive and tedious, naturally linking it to the semi-supervised learning paradigm. In this work, we propose a new semi-supervised time series classification model that leverages features learned from the selfsupervised task on unlabeled data. The idea is to exploit the unlabeled training data with a forecasting task which provides a strong surrogate supervision signal for feature learning. We draw from established multitask learning approaches and model forecasting as an auxiliary task to be optimized jointly with the main task of classification. We evaluate our proposed method on benchmark time series classification datasets in semi-supervised setting and are able to show that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",

Time series Classification is no stranger to Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) too [6, 19] . Although proven to learn high level features across a broad domain of time series classification problems, the success of ConvNets hinges on the availability of large amounts of labeled training data. In reality, however, there is a high cost associated in acquiring such labeled data. As a result, there have been efforts to utilize semi-supervised learning algorithms catered especially for time series classification [2, 9, 12, 17, 21, 22] . The idea behind semi-supervised learning is to exploit unlabeled data for training purpose in the presence of only few labeled instances. The applicability of this learning paradigm naturally extends to time series data as plentiful of it can be acquired trivially. For example, a single polysomnography (sleep study) can generate up to 40,000 heartbeats but it takes the time and expertise of a cardiologist to annotate individual heartbeats [2] . Hence, effective methods for semi-supervised learning can lead to mining vast amounts of time series data for which only comparatively few labels might be available.",

Multi-task learning is an important paradigm in machine learning which builds upon the idea of sharing knowledge between different tasks [1] . A set of tasks is learned in parallel, aiming to improve performance over each task compared with learning one of these tasks in isolation. A multi-task learning problem can also be formulated with respect to main and auxiliary tasks. Auxiliary tasks are motivated by the intuition that for most problem settings, performance over one particular task is of primary importance. However, in order to still reap the benefits of multi-task learning, related tasks could be modeled as auxiliary tasks [16] . These exist solely for the purpose of learning an enriched representation that could increase prediction accuracy over the main tasks.",

This auxiliary task stands to provide a strong surrogate supervision signal for feature learning which when learned in parallel with the main task of classification of time series boosts the performance of the classifier especially in semi-supervised setting. More specifically, we first define a sliding window function parametrized by hyper-parameters of stride and horizon to be forecasted. Next, we augment the training set with generated samples for the forecasting task by providing labeled and unlabeled samples as input to this function. The ConvNet model is trained jointly to classify the labeled samples and forecast future series values. This exploitation of the unlabeled samples leads to learning representations that help boost the classification accuracy. The intuition is that these unlabeled samples come from the same distribution and if the model learns the complex task of forecasting series values accurately, then the same latent representations could be leveraged for classification. In our experiments we show that is indeed the case and our proposed method excels in semi-supervised setting where only a few labeled instances might be available for the model to learn from.",

            "text": "The problem of learning with both labeled and unlabeled data is of central importance in machine learning [25] . We specifically review works that have focused on time series classification. We note the seminal work in the field from Wei et al. [21] . They proposed a self-training approach based on a nearest neighbor classifier. The work from [2] later improved the method significantly by proposing a new meta-feature based distance. In [14] a clustering approach was proposed combined with self-training. Another SSL algorithm in [12] also is in essence a clustering based method. The authors of [22] proposed a graph theoretic SSL algorithm that constructs graphs relating all samples based on different distance functions and consequently propagates labels. The current state-of-the-art method in the field [17] is based on shapelet learning [8] on both labeled and unlabeled time series data. On the other hand, we note recent works [4, 5, 7, 15, 23] which showed that strong supervision could be leveraged by describing a task that is inherent in the data itself (requires no manual annotation). We consider the pioneering work by [4] which leveraged spatial context in an image for self-supervised learning by predicting relative location of one sampled patch to another. Similar selfsupervised tasks were image colorization [23] , solving jigsaw puzzles [15] and classifying image rotations [7] . More closely related to our work is a multi-task self-supervised network [5] . The work firstly tries to compare how the representations learned from recent proposed self-supervised approaches like above compare with each other, and then shows that combining these tasks even in a bare-bones multi-task network without catering for any controlled parameter sharing lifted the accuracy compared with the single-task networks compared before. Moreover, we also note the works that cater for temporal structure. Such temporal structure is inherent in video data, work in [13] proposed a sequential verification task to determine whether a sequence of frames was in correct order. It was shown that with this simple but intuitive task, the ConvNet captures temporally varying information such as human poses and ultimately lifted the accuracy on benchmark action recognition datasets. Another closely related example is [20] where the task was to recognize whether the video is playing forwards or backwards.",

However, with our work we exploit deep learning based methods which solve an auxiliary self-supervised task of forecasting which forces the network to learn filters to solve this particular complex task.

In the case of only few labeled instances being available as in semi-supervised setting, a fully-supervised approach can overfit on the training instances by learning a poor set of features which can hardly distinguish different classes. However, since training proceeds, by using the same set of features repeatedly the model can be more assuming of its predictions which would decrease the training loss in turn. In order to avoid this, a self-supervised task on unlabeled data could be leveraged that can learn comparatively more discriminative features for training and ultimately lead to a significant lift in accuracy on unseen data. Additionally, forecasting is well-studied and easily formulated, but at the same time is complex enough which does not open any doors for cheating, as there are no trivial shortcuts for the model to exploit for solving the task [7] . Moreover, the task allows us flexibility in terms of data generation. By configuring the different values of the horizon and stride, h and s respectively, one could control the number of samples needed to configure an optimal balance between the classification and forecasting task samples.",

From thereon, task-specific final layers output predictions for each task. This is illustrated in the Fig. 1 where we indicate shared parameters between the two tasks with same colored space.

In order to do so, consider that in a multi-task setting, the model is able to accurately forecast an unlabeled sample. The intuition is, if this unlabeled sample belongs to the same class as the very labeled sample the model is now trying to classify, and hence both are similar, then the latent features that were activated for the unlabeled sample could be leveraged to classify.

This evaluation protocol is kept in line with the previous published methods, so as to report a direct fair comparison. The metric of evaluation is classification accuracy throughout the experiments. Given that the initial splits can bias the maximum achievable accuracy, similar to the works before ours, we report the maximum achieved accuracy on the test split by running the experiments 10 times with different hyper-parameters altogether. Table 2 shows the comparison of accuracies for the proposed method and the baselines. The results are also stated for the best performing transfer learning scheme and the \u03a0-model. A number of interesting observations can be drawn from these results. Firstly, we observe that our proposed method is able to outperform all other methods by a wide margin across almost all benchmark datasets considered. This is only made possible because of the exploitation of the unlabeled data better than other methods. Given that we consider here only 10% labeled samples, the difference between the performance of the methods boils down to how these cater for the unlabeled samples. By leveraging the forecasting task, the model is able to pick up useful representations that directly effect the final accuracy.",

Moreover, we plot samples from the dataset together with our forecasts for last window of each of these samples in Fig. 2 . Our second intuition is that given the dataset is based on handwriting, it can be a difficult task to forecast it correctly. The mean squared error that we achieve also hints in this direction, though exceptionally for these handwriting samples it does not convey explicit meaning.",
