Doing so ensures that urgent orthopaedic care can continue to be provided. Although research has widely reported that COVID-19 causes only mild symptoms in individuals in their twenties and thirties with few medical comorbidities (most resident/fellow physicians),4 a situation in which an entire residency program falls ill with the highly virulent COVID-19 would be potentially catastrophic. In addition, if a large group of residents contract the virus with little to no symptoms, they may unintentionally expose a large number of vulnerable patients or other healthcare workers to the pathogen. The surge plan and its early adoption help mitigate these possibilities.",

In response, residency and fellowship programs must consider unique and novel avenues of learning. Weekly meetings and conferences that previously took place in person can be carried out using virtual meeting spaces. In response to the European working time regulations, which were changes analogous to the ACGME duty hour restrictions, Palan et al6 reported their experience in establishing and conducting virtual learning platforms and virtual journal clubs to help optimize resident time spent away from the hospital. The team found a number of unique strengths relative to a traditional in-person learning format, including the ability to revisit the digitally recorded session for clarification or continued learning, ease of access to both clinical material (ie, radiographs and advance imaging) and key articles, and the ability to connect individuals of different geographic regions. Similar practices must be adopted, given the current circumstances.",

This is spread out among the subspecialties (ie, adult reconstruction, hand, and sport) such that only residents assigned to that particular service are expected to attend. Given the decrease in clinical duties and the ease of use of the virtual meeting spaces, these conferences have since been opened up to all residents hoping to attend. Interestingly, attendance at these virtual conferences is now higher than normal, with generally positive reviews from faculty and attendees alike.

Conveniently, diminished case volume and clinical demands may offer newfound time for this focus. We know these independent study efforts are meaningful, with previous research showing that residents with routine traditional home study habits record higher Orthopaedic In-Training Examination scores compared with those who do not.11 To this end, a number of orthopaedic professional societies have published high-quality educational materials, including didactic text or questions, aimed at resident learning (Table 3). For those resources with question banks, tests can be created that are specific to certain subspecialties (ie, adult reconstruction, hand, and sport). On competition of these tests, the scores can be sent to either the program director or subspecialty attending physicians to indicate the level of proficiency. Furthermore, the ABOS requires a specific amount of time spent on each service to graduate.12 These online testing sites allow the program leadership to document work that is being done while a resident is on service to show that the resident/fellow is working toward proficiency.",

Surgical simulation is a powerful tool that can help meet this training demand. As Great Britain's former Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson once said, \u201cIf I had to have my gallbladder out, I would rather it was done by someone who had already done 100 in a simulator.\u201d15 Various simulation modalities studied in orthopaedic surgery have included surgical skill laboratories,16 cadaveric dissection and procedural training,17 computer-based virtual reality training,18 and arthroscopic surgery simulation.19 Despite their promise of improved surgical education, high \u201cobservational\u201d surgical volume, and time spent on direct patient care have been major barriers to widespread adoption. Hospital and residency changes surrounding COVID-19 may make more time available for these endeavors; however, the principles of cleanliness and social distancing must still be respected with use of these tools.",

Self-reported resident questionnaires are an easy option but are typically not considered as valid proficiency measures because of massive internal bias.20 The Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS), Global Rating Scales, and ABOS Surgical Skills Assessment Program are objective measures completed by independent observers who evaluate a trainee's preparedness and performance using a list of specific knowledge-based and performance-based checkpoints for a particular procedure (Table 4). These assessments have been publicized and validated across a number of subspecialties, including hand and wrist surgery,21 shoulder surgery,22 and arthroscopic knee surgery.23 The tools provide objective scores that are simple to record and track over time. In the setting of COVID-19, potential methods of use include recording a baseline OSATS or Global Rating Scales score of particular interest at the time of initial home duty (eg, the carpal tunnel OSATS24 for a resident assigned to the hand service) and ensuring that this score can be matched on the resident's return to the workforce. Doing so will not only encourage active resident learning during the time away but may also contribute to higher quality of patient care.",

Successful leadership during this time carries a number of challenges.27 The ACGME has provided guidance regarding how to handle this situation through a three-stage system28 (Table 5). At this time, most programs, including ours, are functioning in stage 2 capacity. A portion of residents have shifted to nonorthopaedic care duties, whereas others remain dedicated to the timely care of urgent orthopaedic issues. However, a growing number of programs are moving toward stage 3 capacity. At stage 3, four principles should guide all resident/fellow actions, whereas requirements specific to specialty (ie, orthopaedic surgery) are temporarily lifted (unique from stage 2). These principles include adequate resources and training, appropriate supervision for the level of care being provided, adherence to work hour requirements, and allowance of fellows to function as attending medical staff within their core specialty. In some jurisdictions hit hardest by COVID-19, including New York, the state government has temporarily lifted work hour restrictions.29 Developing plans now is critical to prevent resident burnout and to meet the growing demand for COVID-19 care providers.",

Time requirements on specific services, however, do remain in place. Although the ABOS has relaxed some requirements for minimum time-dependent residency experience, this remains a subject of discussion with further guidance expected from the ABOS. It also remains to be seen how this pandemic will affect young physicians preparing for board examination and exploring job prospects. As of March 2020, the ABOS had notified senior residents that they are still planning to administer the part 1 examination in July 2020, as previously planned.
