It is most often transmitted through the bite or scratch of a rabid animal [87], [101]. All species of mammals are susceptible to rabies virus infection, but dogs remain the main carrier of rabies and are responsible for most of the human rabies deaths worldwide [13]. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death. Once the symptoms of rabies have developed, its mortality rate is almost 100%. Rabies causes almost 60,000 deaths worldwide per year [29], [53], [92], [105], more than 95% of which occur in Asia and Africa [50]. More human deaths from rabies occur in Asia than anywhere else in the world [101], where India and China have the most and second most reported cases, respectively [90].",

            "text": "In the last 60 years, China experienced a few major epidemics of human rabies. The first peak occurred from 1956 to 1957 with about 2000 cases in both years, followed by substantial decreases in the early 1960s. The number of cases reached 2000 again in 1969 and increased to the historical record of 7037 cases in 1981. During the 1980s, more then 5000 cases were reported annually. In the 1990s, the number of cases declined rapidly from 3520 in 1990 to 159 in 1996 [60], [115]. Since then, the number of human rabies case has increased steadily again and reached another peak in 2007 with 3300 cases [60], [84]. From 1996 to 2015, 30,300 human rabies cases were reported [59], [60], [61]. Though human rabies were reported in almost all provinces in China [45], nearly 60% of the total rabies cases in China were reported in the southern Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces [60]. It is believed that the increase of rabies deaths results from a major increase in dog ownership and a very low rate of rabies vaccination [60]. In rural areas, about 70 percent of households have dogs and vaccination coverage of dogs is very low, largely because of poor awareness of rabies and the high cost of vaccination. Moreover, owned dogs usually have not been registered and the number of dogs is estimated at 80\u2013200 millions [87].",

Zhang et al. [115] analyzed the 108,412 human rabies cases in China from 1950 to 2004. They suggested that the rabies epidemics in China may be explained by dog population dynamics, untimely and inappropriate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment, and the existence of healthy carrier dogs. Si et al. [79] examined the 22,527 human rabies cases from January 1990 to July 2007 and the details of 244 rabies patients, including their anti-rabies treatment of injuries or related incidents. They concluded that the failure to receive PEP was a major factor for the increase of human cases in China. Song et al. [84] investigated the status and characteristics of human rabies in China between 1996 and 2008 to identify the potential factors involved in the emergence of rabies. Yin et al. [107] compiled all published articles and official documents on rabies in mainland China to examine challenges and needs to eliminate rabies in the country.",

Various models have been used to study different aspects of rabies in wild animals. Anderson et al. [3] pioneered a deterministic model consisting of three subclasses, susceptible, infectious and recovered, to explain epidemiological features of rabies in fox populations in Europe. A susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) model was proposed by Coyne et al. [19], and lately was also used by Childs et al. [14], to predict the local dynamics of rabies among raccoons in the United States. Dimitrov et al. [24] presented a model for the immune responses to a rabies virus in bats. Clayton et al. [17] considered the optimal control of an SEIRS model which describes the population dynamics of a rabies epidemic in raccoons with seasonal birth pulse. Besides these deterministic models, discrete deterministic and stochastic models [2], [7], continuous spatial models [48], and stochastic spatial models [75], [81] have also been employed to study the transmission dynamics of rabies. See also [27], [33], [38], [73], [82], [83]. We refer to reviews by Sterner and Smith [86] and Panjeti and Real [70] for more detailed discussions and references on different rabies models. Note that all these modeling studies focused on rabies in wildlife [55].",

Carroll et al.

Wang and Lou [96] and Yang and Lou [109] used ordinary differential equation models to characterize the transmission dynamics of rabies between humans and dogs. Zinsstag et al.

            "text": "In the last a few years, our team have been trying to model the transmission dynamics of rabies in China by considering different characters and aspects. In Zhang et al. [113] we constructed a basic susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) type model for the spread of rabies virus among dogs and from dogs to humans and used the model to simulate the human rabies data in China from 1996 to 2010. In Hou et al. [43] we modified the basic model in Zhang et al. [113] by including both domestic and stray dogs and applied the model to simulated the human rabies data from Guangdong Province, China. Observing that the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004 exhibit a periodic pattern on an annual base, in Zhang et al. [111] we proposed a SEIR model with periodic transmission rates to investigate the seasonal rabies epidemics and used the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004 to December 2010. To understand the spatial spread of rabies, in Zhang et al. [112] we added diffusion to the dog population in the SEIR model considered by Zhang et al. [113] to obtain a reaction\u2013diffusion equation model, determined the minimum wave speed connecting the disease-free equilibrium to the endemic equilibrium and illustrated the existence of traveling waves by numerical simulations. In order to investigate how the movement of dogs affects the geographically inter-provincial spread of rabies in Mainland China, in Chen et al. [12] we proposed a multi-patch model to describe the transmission dynamics of rabies between dogs and humans and used the two-patch submodel to investigate the rabies virus clades lineages and to simulate the human rabies data from Guizhou and Guangxi, Hebei and Fujian, and Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively. The purpose of this article is to provide a review about the models, results, and simulations that we have obtained in these papers on studying the transmission of rabies in China. We also summarize the prevention and control measures for the spread of rabies in mainlan China that were proposed based on these studies. Finally we discuss some topics for future study.",

To obtain the data involving dogs, we rely on online news, our estimation or data fitting. The values of parameters are listed in Table 1\nand are explained as follows: (a) The number of dogs was estimated to be 30 millions in 1996 and 75 millions in 2009 [60]. (b) The incubation period of rabies is 1\u20133 months. We select the medium value: 2 months. So \u03b4=\u03b4h=1/(212)=6. According to the protection period of rabies vaccine, we assume that \u03bb=\u03bbh=1. The probability of clinical outcome of the exposed is 30\u201370%. Here, we assume that it is 40%. So r=rh=0.4. (c) The rate of vaccination is the product of efficiency and the coverage rate of rabies vaccine. Efficiency of rabies vaccine is about 90%. However, the rates of vaccine coverage for dogs and humans are low. Considering a large number of stray dogs and the poor awareness of people in rural areas, we assume that they are equal to 10% and 60%, respectively.

This demonstrates further that our model has certain rationality. Moreover, our model indicates the tendency of the rabies epidemics with the current control and prevention measures, which is presented in Fig. 2.2(b). It shows that the number of human rabies cases will decrease steadily in the next 7 or 8 years, then increase again and reach another peak (about 1750) in 2030, and finally become stable. Therefore, if no further effective prevention and control measures are taken, the disease will not vanish.",

Zinsstag et al. [117] also estimated the effective reproductive ratio to be 1.01 through a research framework for rabies in an African city. Also for the rabies in USA in the 1940s when the annual reported cases varied from 42 to 113 and sharply increased in 1948, it was estimated that R0=2.334\n[18]. From these, it can be seen that our estimate of R0=2 is reasonable. More discussions of R\n0 for outbreaks of rabies around the world can be found in [18], [40].",

            "text": "Firstly, we examine the influence of initial conditions on the number of infected human rabies cases Ih(t). From Fig. 2.3\n, we can see that the initial population sizes of both dogs and humans effect on Ih(t). Moreover, the initial conditions of dogs can influence not only the number of human rabies cases but also the time of rabies case peak. The initial conditions of humans do not have such effects. We also observe that the peak of the initial outbreak would be postponed if Sd(0) is decreasing. Next, to find better control strategies for rabies infection, we perform some sensitivity analysis of Ih(t) and the basic reproduction number R\n0 in terms of the model parameters. First, we show variations of Ih(t) with time for different values of R\n0 in Fig. 2.4\n. We can see that R\n0 is really the threshold for the establishment of the disease in the susceptible pool and the number of infections increases with the increase of R\n0 (Fig. 2.4(A)). The influences of A and k on Ih(t) are shown in Fig. 2.4(B)(C). It can be observed that Ih(t) decreases as A is declining or k is increasing. When A=106 and k=0.98, the disease can die out. Moreover, we find that the decrease of A cannot delay the time of the first peak while an increase of k can. Furthermore, the influences of A, \u03b2, k on R\n0 are given in Fig. 2.5\n. It is clear that R\n0 changes more quickly when both A and \u03b2 vary. When \u03b2 is very small, the disease can be eliminated even if A=5\u00d7106. When \u03b2\u22654\u00d710\u22127, the disease cannot be eliminated even if A=106. From (B) and (C) in Fig. 2.5, it is clear that when A or \u03b2 is very small, the disease can disappear even if k=0. When A > 3 \u00d7 106 or \u03b2\u22653\u00d710\u22127, the disease cannot be eliminated even if k=1. Hence, it indicates that the influence of A and \u03b2 on the basic reproduction number R\n0 is greater. Fig. 2.5 reflects that whatever dog vaccination rate is, when the annual crop of newborn puppies is greater than 3 million and dog-to-dog transmission rate is greater than 3\u00d710\u22127,\nR\n0 cannot be below 1. However, it is difficult to control \u03b2. Currently, in China the annual crop of newborn puppies can exceed 5 million and the proportion of immunized dogs is only about 10%, which is too low. With the current incidence rate \u03b2=1.58\u00d710\u22127, we know that if the annual crop of newborn puppies A(5 \u00d7 106) is not reduced, it is impossible to have R\n0 below 1; if A=3\u00d7106, it is necessary to keep k \u2265 0.95; if A=2\u00d7106, it is necessary to keep k \u2265 0.39.",

Fig. 3.2\nshows that the simulation of our model with reasonable parameters values provides a good match to the data on infected human rabies cases in Guangdong Province from 2006 to 2010. With the current control measures, our model predicts that the human rabies infection cases would continue decreasing in the next a couple of years and then may increase slightly afterward. With the simulated parameter values, we estimate that R0=1.65. Thus, human rabies will persist in Guangdong Province under the current control and prevention measures. If we fix all parameters except l (the rate at which domestic dogs are abandoned) and \u03f5 (the rate rabid domestic dogs become stray dogs), the basic reproduction number R\n0 increases as l and \u03f5 increase. Fig. 3.3\n(a) and (b) represents the relationship between R\n0 and the quantity of stray dogs. We can see that the influence of parameter \u03f5 on the basic reproduction number R\n0 is greater than that of parameter l, thus culling domestic infected dogs at the right time can effectively decrease R\n0. From Fig. 3.3(c) and (d), we can also see that culling stray dog population (increasing c) can reduce R\n0. Moreover, in order to control rabies, the larger \u03f5 is, the more important it is to target culling stray dogs. Though both vaccinating susceptible dogs and culling stray dogs are effective control measures, comparing Fig. 3.4\n(a) and (b), we find that R\n0 can become less than one if vaccination rate \u03bd is greater than 50% but cannot become less than one even though the culling rate is 100%. Thus, culling stray dogs alone is not a good control measure while vaccination is a more effective one. Fig. 3.4(c) and (d) depicts the plots of R\n0 in terms of (\u03bd, c) and (\u03bd, \u03f5), respectively. We can see that increasing the vaccination rate and the culling rate of rabid domestic dogs are more effective than increasing the vaccination rate and the culling rate of stray dogs. Therefore, culling of infected dogs and vaccination are most important and effective means to control rabies infection. From Fig. 3.5\n(a), we can see that the acute infection in humans in Guangdong Province would be reduced evidently through the decrease of the stray dog population. Moreover, reducing the transfer from infected domestic dogs to stray dogs is more effective than decreasing domestic dogs that are abandoned. According to WHO, as long as victims bitten by animals receive proper PEP timely, human rabies can be prevented [98]. Fig. 3.5(c) indicates that the rabies infection rate can be reduced with the increase of using PEP. Thus, publicity and education on the risk and prevention of rabies is necessary and important to control the epidemic and should be strengthen in endemic areas, especially in rural areas.",

The transmission dynamics associated with these subpopulations are illustrated in Fig. 2.1. The transmission rate between Sd(t) and Id(t) is \u03b2(t), the transmission rate between Sh(t) and Id(t) is \u03b2dh(t), and humans do not spread rabies to each other. We can write transmission rate \u03b2(t) in the general form \u03b2(t)=\u03bb0\u03b2\u2032(Nd)\u03b2\u2032\u2032/Nd, where Nd is the total number of dogs, \u03b2\u2032(Nd) is the number of dogs that a susceptible dog comes across per unit time, \u03b2\u2032\u2032 is the probability of getting bitten after interacting with the susceptible dog, and \u03bb\n0 is the probability of being infected after bitten for the susceptible dog. We can express \u03b2dh(t) similarly. As discussed in the introduction, in the summer and fall there are more frequent interacts among dogs and between dogs and humans and these coefficients are more likely to change as season changes. Thus we use the periodic functions \u03b2(t)=a[1+bsin(\u03c06t+5.5)] and \u03b2dh(t)=a1[1+b1sin(\u03c06t+5.5)] proposed by [76] to describe the transmission rates among dogs and from dogs to humans, where a and a\n1 are the baseline contact rates and b and b\n1 are the magnitudes of forcing.",

We can also predict the general tendency of the epidemic in a long term according to the current situation, which is presented in Fig. 4.2. From these figures we can see that the epidemic of rabies can be relieved in a short time (Fig. 4.2(a)), but cannot be eradicated with the current prevention and control measures (Fig. 4.2(b)). Moreover, with these parameter values, we can roughly estimate that the basic reproduction number R0=1.03 under the current circumstances in China.

Most people, especially in the rural and remote areas, have little knowledge about rabies and even do not know what to do after being bitten by dogs. It was reported in [84] that 66.3% of rabies victims did not seek medical services at all and 27.6% of the cases received inadequate PEP.

The parameters about humans including the annual birth rate and natural death rate of humans in each province are adopted from the \u201cChina Health Statistical Yearbook 2012\u201d [66]. The incubation period for rabies is typically 1\u20133 months [101], we assume that it is 2 months on average, thus \u03c3iH=6/year. Similarly, we also have \u03c3iH=10/year\n[91]. The disease induced death rates of humans and dogs are assumed to be 1 [60]. According to [60], the vaccination rate kiH of humans in China is about 0.5 and the risk factor of clinical outcome of exposed dogs \u03b3iD is 0.4. Based on studies the minimum duration of immunity for canine is 3 years [77], we assume that the loss rate of vaccination immunity for dogs in patch i is \u03bbiD=13/year\u22480.33/year. Rabies mortality after untreated bites by rabid dogs varies from 38% to 57% [42], thus we take the average 47.5% as the risk factor of clinical outcome of exposed humans.",

Under this assumption the disease would die out in both provinces since their isolated basic reproduction numbers are less than one. This example theoretically shows the possibility that the immigration of dogs can lead the disease to a worse scenario even it could be eliminated in each isolated patch. It is remarkable that we only mentioned the dog immigration here because a simple observation to the formula of the basic reproduction number shows that only the immigration rates of dogs (\u03d5ijK for K=S,E,I,V) can affect it. In fact, only dogs can carry the rabies virus and then spread it to humans and other dogs. This transmission feature supports our mathematical analysis. Furthermore, Fig. 6.6(b) shows a direct comparison of numerical simulations on the number of human cases from the model with immigration and without immigration. The additional green curve represents simulations of the human cases without any immigration in Hebei and the human infectious population size goes to zero faster which is consistent with the fact that the isolated basic reproduction number (0.5477) in Hebei is less than one.",

To eliminate rabies we need some effective control strategies that can reduce R0 significantly. Thus it is even more challenging to control and prevent the disease in Guangxi and Guizhou from a numerical perspective. In Fig. 6.6(a), we compare the human rabies in Guizhou having dog immigration with that having no dog immigration.

Then the isolated basic production numbers satisfy the inequality: R01=2.3246>R02=0.7749. So rabies is endemic in patch 1 and will die out in patch 2. First, let (the immigration rate of dogs from patch 1 to patch 2) \u03d512=0.02.

However, the dog immunization rate in China has yet reached 10%, which is even lower in the countryside [60]. So increasing dog vaccination coverage rate is necessary and crucial in control rabies transmission in China. We suggest decreasing the dog birth rate in order to reduce the dog population and stop culling dogs and try to vaccinate these dogs instead. For pet dogs, registration and immunization should be mandatory; the price of vaccine should be reduced; the awareness of prevention rabies for dog owners should be enhanced; and contraception measures should be taken.",

It was reported that at least 18.2% of the human rabies cases in Guangdong Province are caused by stray dogs [79]. In Section 3, taking this fact into consideration and using rabies data from Guangdong Province, we proposed a SEIV model for the dog\u2013human transmission of rabies in which both domestic and stray dogs are considered. By the analysis of the model, we concluded that the cases of rabies in Guangdong would decrease gradually in the next a few year and increase slightly afterward, which indicates that rabies cannot be controlled or eradicated under the current strategies. By carrying out some sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number in terms of various parameters, we found that the vaccination rate of domestic dogs, the recruitment rate of domestic dogs, the number of stray dogs and the valid time of the immunity play very important roles for the transmission of rabies. From Fig. 3.5(a), we can see that the acute infection in humans in Guangdong Province would be reduced evidently through the decrease of the stray dog population. Moreover, reducing the transfer from infected domestic dogs to stray dogs is more effective than decreasing domestic dogs that are abandoned. As shown in Fig. 3.4(a) and Fig. 3.5(b), rabies can be controlled with the vaccination coverage rate over 75% which is a little bit higher than the recommended vaccination rate by WHO, the main reason is that a large number of stray dogs exists in most areas of Guangdong Province. However, from Fig. 3.5(b), although acute infection cases can be reduced by culling stray dogs, rabies cannot be eventually eradicated by this measure alone. Therefore, culling stray dogs is not a good strategy in controlling rabies. To prevent and control rabies in stray dogs, as suggested in Section 2, fostering of stray dogs could be introduced and encouraged, food baits containing abortifacient oral vaccine in capsules could be distributed in order to reduce the stray dog population and vaccinate stray dogs.",

Indeed, the human rabies cases increased continuously and dramatically in China from 1996 to 2006 and then started to decrease steadily (see Fig. 2.2). In Section 3 we used the data from 2004 to 2010 for the whole country and it was estimated that the \u201caverage\u201d basic reproduction number for China for this time period is R1=1.25. These results indicate that human rabies in Guangdong Province is more severe than the average in China.",

Firstly, we calculated the basic reproduction number R\n0 and analyzed the dynamics of the model including the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the existence of periodic solutions. We then used our model to simulate the monthly data on the number of infected human cases from January 2004 to December 2010 in China reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health and predicted the general tendency of disease in China.

From Fig. 2.2, we can see that the numbers of infected human cases increased dramatically from 159 cases in 1996 and were fierce from 1996 to 2004. After 2004, the spread of rabies began to slow down. Moreover, the data in 2005 and after 2007 decreased. So the fact that R\n0 in Section 4 is less than in Section 2 is reasonable.",

Moreover, we discussed the stability of the endemic equilibrium with diffusion to illustrate that the spatial pattern cannot appear. The key is to check the magnitude of influence of parameters on human rabies cases and the minimal wave speed c*. From the formula of c*, we can see that only d2,d3(=d2) can influence c*, but d\n1, d\n4 do not. Therefore, only the movement of exposed and infected dogs affects the spatial spread of rabies. From Fig. 5.6(b), we know that the influence of d\n2, d\n3 on c* is larger which illustrates that quarantine of dogs during movement is important to control the spatial spread of rabies.",

The expression and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number indicates that the movement of dogs plays an essential role in the spatial transmission of rabies. As mentioned in the previsous sections, reducing dog birth rate and increasing dog immunization coverage rate are the most effective methods in controlling human rabies infections in China. They also play important roles in controlling the spatial spread of rabies based on the multi-patch model. WHO recommends that 70% of dogs in a population should be immunized to eliminate the rabies. Unfortunately, this rate is still lower than 10% in most regions in China. Therefore, efforts to bring the awareness of the importance of treatments and enhance the vaccination coverage in dogs are important to control the disease in China.",

First of all, the immigration may lead a basic reproduction number to be larger than one even if the isolated basic reproduction numbers are all less than one. Therefore, the immigration of dogs is the main factor for the long-distance inter-provincial spread of rabies. We note that the transportation of dogs even between non-endemic provinces, such as Fujian and Hebei, can cause human rabies in Hebei to increase greatly. Additionally, the movement of dogs from regions with a low vaccination rate also makes the situation worse. Attention should be paid not only to the provinces with more reported cases but also to the provinces with low vaccination rates. In those extremely poor areas, where dogs have a low vaccination coverage, the dog trade business and transportation to other areas will contribute to the geographical spread of rabies significantly. To control the disease at a national level, more efforts are needed in these regions.",

In some areas, such as the endemic provinces Guizhou and Guangxi, people eat dogs due to minority culture or harsh climate. There is no open market for selling and buying dogs for business purpose, however the black market always exists. It is frequently reported that trucks sometimes full of dogs are intercepted by animal lovers in the inter-provincial highway. Sometimes more than one thousand dogs were crammed into many tiny cages in one truck. The efficiency of such dog transportation has been enhanced by the fast development and expansion of the highway system in China in the past ten years. Chinese law requires that the transported animals must be certified as vaccinated for rabies and other diseases. However, dog traders are found to falsify the paperwork for most of the dogs in the truck to reduce their cost. Thus it would be important to regulate the market and implement certain policies on dogs (such as vaccine records) and the dog traders (such as licenses). During our research, we found that it was very difficult to find the information on dog population in China due to the lack of dog registration management. Since a large number of dogs are transported from provinces to provinces, it is necessary to register and manage such transportation properly. In particular, dogs carrying rabies viruses can easily spread the virus to other dogs when they are crowded into a small space during the trip. The last case of our sensitivity analysis shows the oblivious dangers resulted from the transportation of infectious dogs that has a destination with a low vaccination rate. We suggest creating strict and uniform procedures to test the dogs that will be transported.",
