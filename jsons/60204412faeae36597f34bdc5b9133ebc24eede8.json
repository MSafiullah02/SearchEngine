This research aimed to assess (to the best of our knowledge), for the first time, the current level of awareness towards MERS-CoV among the Al-Jouf region population through a well-designed multistage questionnaire. Subjects and methods A cross-sectional study of 384 participants recruited from various places in Al-Jouf government was conducted through a valid and reliable questionnaire including sociodemographic and MERS-CoV knowledge data. Results The majority of the participants showed generally moderate knowledge about MERS-CoV. Age, education, and occupation were the only significant predictors of the level of low awareness concern. Also, the public awareness about the nature, communicability, and lethal effect of the disease was good overall; however, knowledge about incubation period, clinical picture, and epidemiology of the disease needs more governmental concern. The Ministry of Health was the main source of information. Conclusion Empowering public information regarding the incubation period and epidemiology of the disease is needed.

However, there was a significant difference regarding age, level of education, and employment. Similar to the results of Alqahtani and Aldawsari (2015) and Al-Abdullah et al. (2016) , the level of knowledge was higher particularly among younger individuals in the age range 20 and 40 years. This might be attributed to the capability of young persons to gain their knowledge from social media. Social media represents the second major source of information to the respondents in this work, as shown by our result. This comes in contrast to elderly people, who gained their knowledge from newspapers, television, and radio. Therefore, alleviating the concerns of the government in using various routes to reach different population groups is crucial. It is not surprising that postgraduates as well as governmental employees showed a high level of knowledge. This might be due to self-education and sharing the governmental campaign about MERS-CoV, respectively. In contrast to this, the greater knowledge of unemployed participants might come via benefiting from their free time in self-education and use of social networks. It is essential to note that, while the majority of the respondents were highly informed of the nature, communicability, and lethal effect of the disease, a still quite significant proportion of the respondents held wrong concepts about the mode of transmission. For instance, nearly half of the respondents were aware that corona is transmitted by camels. We considered this percentage to be insufficient and increasing public awareness of the people in Al-Jouf region, especially those who live in rural areas, should be taken seriously. Al-Jouf region, as with other desert regions in Saudi Arabia, is famous for raising camels since ancient times. There is even an area that lies 800 m from Sakaka, and known as Al-Jamal area, where large stones carved in the mountains were found in the form of camels (Center for International Communication, CIC 2018). It has been known that MERS-CoV was detected in dromedary camels in a number of countries and represented 22-25% of camel-to-human transmissions (Aguanno et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2018) . Studies powerfully suggested that MERS-CoV has been primarily passed through an evolutionary recombination process in dromedary camels in Africa and exported to the Arabian Peninsula through the camel trading routes (Andualem 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 267, "end": 297, "text": "Alqahtani and Aldawsari (2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 302, "end": 327, "text": "Al-Abdullah et al.

Public health education programs have confirmed their value in increasing the awareness of MERS-Cov disease. Consequently, the Ministry of Health should expand its awareness role through providing the media, schools and health centers, and governmental and non-governmental organizations with adequate and sound information and educational materials about the disease features and preventive measures. In addition to this, cooperation with the university medical research centers to invent new preventive and control agents is necessary. 4.
