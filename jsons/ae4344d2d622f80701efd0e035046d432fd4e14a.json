A Canadian case-control study assessing calf scours on beef farms reported a morbidity of 34% on case and 10% on control farms, with mortality rates of 6.2% and 0.1%, respectively. 3 A study in France 4 found morbidity of calf scours was 14.6%, with more than half the cases occurring in the first week of life and only 15% of cases occurring after 14 days of age. The overall mortality rate was 3.6%. A Swiss study of low-input beef farms reported an average calf mortality of 6.1%, with a large variation of 0-50% between farms. 5, 6 The two main recorded causes of death were respiratory (26%) and calf scours (26%). A Colorado study reported a calf mortality of 4.5% from birth to weaning, with the most common causes of death besides dystocia and stillbirth being hypothermia (12.4%) and scours (11.5%). 7 A study of southern Australian beef properties reported that 33% of the farms included in the study reported an overall mortality rate >2% in calves between birth and 16 weeks of age. 2 When this period was divided into five different age groups, the highest mortality rates were seen in calves younger than 5 days old (0.3%) and between 6 and 21 days of age (1.0%). 2 The pathogens involved in calf scours are well known and described in many studies, but the prevalence differs between countries and is related to the industry (beef or dairy) in which calves are born. 1, 2, 4, 8 In Argentina, a study of beef and dairy farms reported the most commonly found pathogen in calves less than 30 days old was bovine rotavirus (45.1%), whereas dairy calves were most commonly infected with Cryptosporidium parvum (29.6%). 9 The French study of beef farms isolated bovine rotavirus in 47.4% of cases and Cryptosporidium in 16.5% of scouring calves from birth to 30 days of age; Escherichia coli was isolated from 20.3% during the first days of life. 4 An Australian study of dairy and dairy-beef operations found that bovine rotavirus was the most common pathogen identified (79.9%) followed by C. parvum (58.5%), Salmonella spp. (23.8%), bovine coronavirus (21.6%) and E. coli K99 (17.4%). 1 That study also noted that bovine rotavirus and Salmonella spp. were more likely to be identified in samples collected from dairy-beef than dairy properties. 1 Specific management factors related to the incidence of calf scours in overseas studies are often associated with hygiene, such as heifers being calved in a separate location and calves with scours and their dams being placed in a quarantine paddock. 3, 10 Nutrition is another important area of management and, more specifically, feeding corn silage, extra protein, vitamin, copper or salt supplements has been associated with the incidence of calf scours. [10] [11] [12] The most important animal factor identified was parity, with low-parity heifers having a higher incidence of scours in their offspring because of the production of less and lower quality colostrum, more calving difficulties and potentially poorer mothering skills than older parity cows. 11 Poor drainage in the nursing area and a large calving area were some environmental factors associated with calf scours. 3 So far there is little evidence in Australia regarding the association between possible risk factors and scours in beef calves up to 14 days after birth. 2 To improve this, a survey to collect information was conducted among beef properties in the Hume area, New South Wales, to identify the incidence of morbidity and mortality of beef calves affected with scours between birth and 14 days of age and to investigate farm characteristics or management practices associated with scours being present.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 118, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 119, "end": 120, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 453, "end": 454, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 803, "end": 805, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 806, "end": 807, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1082, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1268, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1451, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1654, "end": 1656, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1659, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1662, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1664, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1902, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2129, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2369, "end": 2370, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2529, "end": 2530, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2782, "end": 2784, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2785, "end": 2787, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2989, "end": 2993, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2994, "end": 2998, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2999, "end": 3003, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3292, "end": 3294, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3415, "end": 3416, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3571, "end": 3572, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In February 2011, a questionnaire and return address envelope were distributed to 721 farms with at least 50 head of beef cattle in southern New South Wales, selected from the database provided by the Hume Livestock Health and Pest Authority.

However, biosecurity is a main priority in all animal health programs and potentially the main source of new infections on farms. Additional mineral supply, wintering cows and heifers in the same paddock or vaccinating against common disease did not differ between the two groups, with the exception of clostridial diseases. For animal-related factors, only the presence of multiple breeds and of mothering problems/weak calves were found to be significant. Possible reasons why commonly known risk factors did not apply to the situation in NSW could be the different environment and management systems compared with overseas studies. Most of the farms in the current study are mixed farming systems (56.5%), have winter cows and heifers in different paddocks (73.4%) and segregate them for calving in separate paddocks (79.5%). Shelter for young calves is not likely to be an important factor because the most common pathogens associated with scours are bovine rotavirus and C. parvum, 1 but would be more effective if E. coli was an important issue. Poor drainage in the nursing area is not very likely to be an important factor, as this is not a commonly used practice on beef farms in New South Wales. Milk production, an important selection trait within the Australian beef industry, is also not an issue, as more than 90% of the producers indicated that the milk production of their cows was good to very good.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 339, "end": 346, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "PRODUCTION ANIMALS"}, {"text": "The two most common pathogens detected in this and other studies are bovine rotavirus and C. parvum 1,4,9 and each pathogen requires a different management approach. A correct diagnosis would help in developing a plan for this or next year's calving season and prevent or treat new cases in the current season. The results of the final regression model indicated that unexplained or sudden death of calves was associated with affected farms. A possible explanation could be the time between infection and death of the calf. We focused on the period between birth and 14 days of age, which is when the pathogens related to calf scours can cause death very quickly and if not observed by the farmer it will be recorded as a 'sudden' or 'unexplained' death of a calf. Besides time, the criteria used to identify affected calves could be an issue. The fact that only a small proportion of farmers recorded information on scours and just one farmer submitted samples to a laboratory might indicate that the criteria for identifying affected calves are insufficient. Therefore, factors such as 'monitoring' and 'criteria to identify affected calves' might be areas of focus in both future research and advice given to farmers to control or prevent calf scours. The other significant factor, single or multiple breeds, can be related to the management system of the farm. Each breed requires its own optimal management system. Managing several breeds instead of one can cause suboptimal conditions for each breed, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality rates in the calves. Overall, it can be concluded that the morbidity and mortality associated with calf scours on southern NSW beef farms is low compared with other studies but with significant variation among farms. Under-reporting, the high non-response rate and incorrect diagnosis could have confounded these findings. Many risk factors found to be associated with scours in overseas studies did not apply to the farms investigated in the current study. Still the question remains, which additional questions could have been included that could help to explain the difference between affected and unaffected farms? With hindsight, questions regarding the frequency and methods of monitoring calves during the calving season and the criteria used by farmers to identify an affected calf should have been included. The main recommendations from this study include improving the monitoring and diagnosis of calf scours to identify common pathogens and to investigate causes of neonatal deaths. This information could then be used to develop farm-specific management protocols for the effective treatment of neonatal calf scours in New South Wales. Possible methods to improve the submission rate of faecal samples would be to inform farmers more about the financial impact of calf scours and develop sampling kits, including ice packs, that are easy to use on farms and can be directly transported from the farm to laboratory.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ".
