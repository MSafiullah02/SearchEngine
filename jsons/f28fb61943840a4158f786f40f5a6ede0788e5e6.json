The method involves digestion and reassembly of a target gene to generate a pool of smaller DNA fragments with random ends but controllable lengths, followed by screening for foldable fragments using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a folding reporter. The surface glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and HIV-1 were used as model proteins. Two foldable fragments for SARS-CoV spike protein were identified, which coincide with various anti-SARS-CoV peptides. A similar treatment of the HIV-1 gp120 yielded a number of fragments that are associated with the critical CD4 binding site, or the partially buried CCR5 binding site of the protein. The random dissection approach described here should be applicable to other viral proteins for isolating soluble viral surface protein fragments, and may provide alternatives to the fulllength proteins (subunits) or linear short peptides in search for antigen or vaccine candidates.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "261 the surface proteins, soluble fragments may be advantageous as they have the potential to provide discontinuous epitopes. Additionally, it has been suggested that the binding of viral surface proteins to cell receptors may expose sites in the viral proteins otherwise inaccessible (2, 3) . In particular, the binding of HIV gp120 to CD4 seems to expose a site that is critical for subsequent binding to the CCR receptor, but which is partially buried in the resting state of the HIV surface protein. This has been implicated as a possible mechanism adopted by the virulent virus to evade the immune surveillance (2, 3) . We reasoned that by producing discrete foldable fragments which are taken out of the context of the full-length protein, some of these hidden critical sites might become exposed in the fragments thus obtained. Consequently, these discrete foldable polypeptide fragments might facilitate screening for more effective vaccines or antigen candidates.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 285, "end": 288, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 289, "end": 291, "text": "3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 616, "end": 619, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 620, "end": 622, "text": "3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Searching for soluble fragments of a polypeptide chain may be achieved by genetic cleavage at predetermined sites based on detailed analysis of the target structure, or by the more traditional protease digestion method (4) (5) (6) (7) . However, the former approach is limited by the generally poor understanding of the structurefunction relationship of proteins, while for the latter only a small number of exposed surface sites are accessible to proteases. A random method that in theory can thoroughly and individually analyze all possible folding fragments would be more desirable. To this end, we formulated a dissection scheme that is capable of searching for soluble fragments of a given target in a random but systematic manner, and which is independent of protein function. The solubility of the dissected protein fragments was accessed through expression analysis of these fragments as N-terminal fusions to green fluorescent protein (GFP), which has been shown to be a good indicator for the \"foldability\" of the upstream polypeptide partner (8, 9) . This method using GFP as folding reporter is generally applicable because it does not require structural or functional information on the target proteins. Results from dissection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein and HIV-1 gp120 are presented. 1. Use the T7 promoter-driven system originally developed by Studier and colleagues (10) (11) (12) , pET30a(+) ( see Fig. 1a ). It is a powerful vector for the cloning and expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli . Target genes can be inserted into the multiple cloning region and placed under the control of strong bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals, and expression is induced by isopropylthio-\u03b2 -Dgalactoside (IPTG). The pET30a(+) expression vector carries an N-terminal His \u2022Tag configuration plus an optional C-terminal His \u2022Tag sequence which can be used to assay expression levels and purify proteins. The pET30a(+) expression vector also contains a kanamycin resistance gene. 2. Subclone the GFP gene from a commercial source. We used an in-house GFP-containing vector pET30a-hydA , which was constructed from pQB-2 (13) . This GFP variant carries 11 extra amino acid residues at the C-terminus which help emit a stronger fluorescent signal than the wild-type GFP (13) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 222, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 223, "end": 226, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 227, "end": 230, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 231, "end": 234, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1056, "text": "(8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1059, "text": "9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1438, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1443, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1448, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2202, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1467, "end": 1474, "text": "Fig. 1a", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "3.
