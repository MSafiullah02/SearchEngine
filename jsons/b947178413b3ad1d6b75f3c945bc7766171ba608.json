Some researchers opine that the SARS-CoV has its origin from bats and the prevalence of this virus to humans was through palm civets: the intermediate source between bats and human population. 1, 2 The most responsible reasons for it include the large human population gathering and human intervention which have violated the ecosystem globally. The population of the world intrudes the various untouched ecologies and put themselves before the unknown viruses and bacteria without knowing their threat or impact of exposure to humankind. 3, 4 The Coronavirus can travel beyond species boundaries. Earliest infection of SARS-CoV-2 was in Wuhan (China), and the WHO has called this pandemic as Corona Virus Disease 2019 . Initially, it was thought, that this virus also has its origin from the animals to humans, as some of the infected people were from a wholesale seafood market in Wuhan. At a later stage, infections were found in humans, those who have not even visited that particular market. Thus, making clear that this virus can also spread by human to human exposure [5] [6] [7] .",

Spreading or transmission of COVID-19 can be through close contact of human beings or by touch or the aerosol spreading of the virus. [8] [9] [10] The most common way of spreading of this virus is through respiratory droplets as the infected one coughs or sneezes. These micro-droplets containing the virus can infect a healthy human by settling on the face (mouth, nose, ears, eyes) or hands 11 . This virus can sustain for a long time on various surfaces which is also considered as a significant reason for its transmission. Frequent touching of the facial area, handshake and unavoidable touch to different surfaces while travelling (through various transport means) is also a significant threat to humans. Also, the transmission is known as \"hidden transmission\" by the carrier unknowingly spreading the infection to other population exists 12 .",

They have used a Bayesian regression model to study the decay rate of the virus on different surfaces. Around ten experiments with different conditions involving the above two viruses were done for five different environmental conditions. These include four metal surfaces and aerosol. Plastic, Stainless Steel, Copper, and Cardboard were the four metal surfaces taken to consideration. The reason behind to take theses metal surfaces was the use of these materials in our day to day life, whether the population is travelling, shopping or doing work in the office. Study on the aerosol showed that SARS-CoV-2 could sustain it for up to three hours. One important observation was that during the time the virus reduces its infecting capability, from 103.5 to 102.7 Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID) 50 per litre of air. A similar tendency of SARS-CoV-1 is also observed in this study and identified that the infection capability of COVID-19 virus has reduced from 104.3 to 103.5 TCID50 per millilitre 26 . Table 2 gives a comparative study of both viruses and shows that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 have significant sustaining time on different surfaces. Although the behaviour of both the viruses is almost similar on some metal surfaces like in the first three environmental conditions, they show linear decay in infection capability [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, in aerosol, plastic and stainless steel, the concentration of virus on the medium is different, but the differences are insignificant. Under the tested experimental conditions, SARS-CoV-2 was similar to SARS-CoV-1. These viruses include high viral load having the potential to infect the peoples, and before spreading, the affected person may be asymptomatic [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .",

Thus, to make these two graphs, the lower concentration values were taken from the table no. 1, as those are the correct values of concentration at the end of sustaining time of virus on different metal surfaces. It can be derived from Figure 1 and Figure 2 , that, the sustainability of SARS-CoV-2 is more or less similar to SARS-CoV-1 for the given environmental conditions. We see a linear decrease in the infection capability of this virus, with respect to time, and the same varies according to the medium (surface). This linear decrease shows the exponential decay in virus titre in per litre of air or millilitre of medium with time. The green line shows the linear decay of infection capability in the graphs. Graphs for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 are confined from 1 to Stainless Steel, 4-Copper and 5-Cardboard.",
