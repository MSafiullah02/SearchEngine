Top leaders and bureaucrats get to work together and to know and trust one another. When its club dynamics grows and some collective identity emerges behavior changes. Of course this is more difficult at the G20 which inevitably has more of the atmosphere of a public concert than a private club. But while this may not achieve the same level of discourse as a G8 meeting, there are offsetting advantages. As opposed to the G8 the G20 allows key voices from the global South to be heard in global and regional decision-making, and in so doing it injects both a catalytic element and degree of equality.",

In such a competitive and fragmented atmosphere it is easy to opt for the status quo. Yet the G20 does seem to be a special opportunity that should not be missed, allowing GHG a hub that it needs. Moreover, in practical terms there are signs of moves in this direction. The focus on the notion of a \u201cglobal safety net\u201d put forward by South Korea as hosts of the November 2010 G20 is compatible with this development. So is the prominent place accorded to Bill Gates in the context of the Business G20 to be held in conjunction with the leaders\u2019 summit.",
