There is concern that the expected increase in HDU/ICU bed occupancy and the risk of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection will severely limit or preclude surgical intervention. It is important that consideration is given to the prospects of surgical treatment. For patients who have started or completed neoadjuvant therapy, surgical intervention should be expedited where possible. If there is uncertainty related to surgical capacity, we would suggest that dCRT with no neoadjuvant or induction component is the most appropriate option to provide an upfront definitive treatment approach while limiting infection risk. In the absence of robust head-to-head data, dCRT and neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery are typically viewed as delivering equivalent outcomes for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma [8]. The evidence for equivalent outcomes from dCRT is less robust for oesophageal adenocarcinoma but good outcomes were seen for this group in SCOPE1 [9,10].",

            "text": "Despite the theoretical advantages of hypofractionated regimens during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is to our knowledge no robust evidence to advocate for a hypofractionated dCRT approach. Careful patient selection for dCRT using standard 50 Gy/25 fractions fractionation with concurrent chemotherapy is therefore imperative and patients should be counselled regarding the risk:benefit ratio of treatment. Patients at a higher risk include those with comorbidities and who are more likely to require acute admission, such as those with high-grade dysphagia when starting treatment [11]. Risks may also be mitigated through the use of weekly carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel in place of 3-weekly cisplatin\u2013fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, given the more favourable toxicity profile. In a recently presented phase III trial and in a multicentre retrospective analysis from the UK, weekly carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel-based dCRT has shown 2- and 3-year overall survival of 50 and 40%, respectively [12,13]. The regimen was well tolerated and resulted in 10% grade 3 or above haematological toxicity, compared with 28% for cisplatin\u2013fluoropyrimidine-based treatment in SCOPE1 [9,12,13]. We also suggest considering lowering the threshold for prophylactic enteral nutrition where there is capacity to place enteral feeding tubes, as this would potentially minimise the need for unplanned hospitalisation [14]. Follow-up of patients managed with dCRT should, if service pressures allow, include endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging at 8 weeks post-treatment, with a low threshold for surgery if indicated [15]. It is hoped that HDU and ICU access may be somewhat better in the timeframe for 5\u20136 months, where such surgery might be considered.",

In a recent single-centre retrospective series, this regimen resulted in reasonable median overall survival of 26 months that compared with 29 months for a dCRT cohort from the same centre that had fewer comorbidities but more advanced disease [16].

There is evidence to suggest that the benefits conferred by nCRT for pathological complete response and overall survival are seen at doses of 39.6 Gy, but it is less certain that higher doses deliver additional benefit [18]. Beyond the pandemic peak when surgical capacity begins to be restored but where services remain stretched, nCRT may again represent an appropriate treatment option. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may also be considered with prophylactic growth factor support, although in both instances (neoadjuvant chemotherapy or nCRT) multidisciplinary teams need to consider whether such patients are likely to proceed to surgical resection within a reasonable timeframe.",

Given the anticipated pressure on palliative care teams and a reduction in endoscopy capacity for procedures such as endoluminal stenting, radiotherapy will probably be an important option for symptom relief [19]. The risks of standard fractionation schedules in this setting of 30 Gy/10 fractions or 40 Gy/15 fractions will probably outweigh any benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and add further pressure to radiotherapy departments. As such, we suggest use of single 8 Gy/1 fraction or 20 Gy/5 fractions treatment schedules. There is little evidence that dose escalation above 20 Gy achieves additional symptomatic benefit [20].",
