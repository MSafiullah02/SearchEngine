In ARDS management, VV-ECMO enhances gas exchange and may mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury. Although randomized controlledtrials [1, 2] and retrospective studies [3] have failed to show a clear mortality benefit for VV-ECMO use in ARDS, they are reassuring against inferior mortality outcomes, and suggest possible clinical and mortality advantage.",

This lack of published data may reflect the acuity of the current crisis as well as staff and supply shortages at VV-EMCO centers caring for large numbers of Covid-19 patients. [4] In these settings, the use of a resource-intensive therapy such as VV- ECMO [4] suggested an ethical framework for rationing care in the current pandemic: benefits must be maximized, patients must be treated equally, and patients with the greatest need (the \"worst off\") should be prioritized. If patients are otherwise equal candidates for a scarce resource, preference may be given to those who provide a relevant benefit to others (e.g. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 healthcare workers). [4] These and similar principles [5] must be considered by any center contemplating VV-ECMO in the setting of acutely strained healthcare resources due to this current pandemic.",

When candidate patients exceed VV-ECMO resources, as could occur during a Covid-19 \"surge,\" criteria for discontinuation of therapy must be delineated prior to cannulation. Goals of care conversations, including proactive discussions of possible treatment failure, are essential.

This warrants particular mention due to the relatively large, multidisciplinary teams involved in high-quality ECMO care, and the volume of PPE that required in the setting of overall shortages. Inter-center transfer of VV-ECMO patients with Covid-19 may also present specific challenges regarding transmission risk. [5] Personnel, equipment, facilities, and intra-and inter-hospital systems may require reorganization to maximize effective patient care and staff safety. [5] It is likely that Covid-19 will remain the salient cause of ARDS for the foreseeable future.
