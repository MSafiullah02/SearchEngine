The incidence of cancer is projected to continue to rise, with an estimated 21.7 million new cases by 2030 (ref. 1). In the current clinic, patients with cancer typically receive a combination of treatments, including surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which have substantially increased the overall survival and quality of life of the patients. However, the therapeutic effects of these treatments have been greatly limited by their inability to selectively image and deliver therapeutics to tumours2,3. As a result, these treatments are unable to maximize surgical resection or safely deliver chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy without inducing significant side effects2,3.",

Furthermore, cancers are typically heterogeneous across tissues and within tumours and are therefore unlikely to be successfully targeted using a single ligand6,7. The ligand\u2013receptor approach is particularly limited for the imaging of brain tumours and the delivery of drugs to them owing to the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB)8\u201310.

Example transporters include large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), alanine, serine, cysteine-preferring transporter 2 (ASCT2) and glucose transporters11\u201314. In particular, LAT1\u2014which mediates the transport of large neutral amino acids\u2014is promising, as it has been shown to be highly expressed in a wide variety of tumours. In normal tissue, LAT1 is expressed in only a few organs, including the placenta, BBB, spleen, testis and colon13. LAT1 has previously been targeted for cancer chemotherapy using LAT1 inhibitors, such as 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH)15. Unfortunately, BCH-mediated chemotherapy has largely failed owing to a lack of potency and specificity. BCH inhibits all four LATs, including LAT1, LAT2, LAT3 and LAT4, each of which has distinct physiological functions. Effective inhibition of LAT1 requires high doses of BCH, which often induces significant toxicity15. LAT1 has also been targeted to enhance the delivery of chemotherapy drugs to tumours. It was shown that conjugation of aspartate enabled LAT1-mediated delivery, improving the accumulation of doxorubicin (DOX) in tumours by threefold to sixfold (ref. 16).",

However, most of the previously reported CQDs suffer from non-selective interactions with both tumour cells and normal cells17,18. Here, we report large amino acid mimicking CQDs (LAAM CQDs) for selective imaging and drug delivery to tumours, regardless of the origin and location, but not to normal tissue. LAAM CQDs are a group of CQDs with paired \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups on their edge, which trigger multivalent interactions with LAT1. We found that LAAM TC-CQDs\u2014a type of LAAM CQDs that were synthesized using 1,4,5,8-tetraminoanthraquinone (TAAQ) and citric acid (CA)\u2014are capable of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and can also image and deliver chemotherapy drugs to tumours, including tumours in the brain. In contrast to traditional CQDs, LAAM CQDs have the ability to selectively image and deliver therapeutic agents to tumours. This finding may suggest a promising approach to selectively imaging and delivering therapeutic agents to tumours.",

The reactant was purified using silica-gel column chromatography, resulting in a clear blue solution. The procedures for synthesizing LAAM TC-CQD are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. We demonstrated that this approach ensures that all of the small-molecular-fragment by-products can be removed (Supplementary Fig. 2). Analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that LAAM TC-CQDs are well dispersed with an average diameter of 2.45 nm (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 3). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis revealed a well-resolved crystal lattice with spacing of 0.21 nm (Fig. 1b, inset), which is consistent with the (100) lattice fringes of graphene20. The high degree of crystallinity was confirmed using Raman spectrum analysis, in which the crystalline G band at 1,605 cm\u22121 is stronger than the disordered D band at 1,365 cm\u22121, with a G-to-D intensity ratio (IG/ID) of 1.4 (Supplementary Fig. 4). An analysis using atomic force microscopy identified that LAAM TC-CQDs have a typical topographic height of 0.943 nm (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that most of LAAM TC-CQDs consist of 2\u20133 graphene layers. Analysis of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern revealed a broad (002) peak centred at ~26\u00b0 (Supplementary Fig. 6), confirming the graphene structure of LAAM TC-CQDs.",

            "text": "We determined the molecular structure of LAAM TC-CQDs. First, we determined the amount of amino acid groups on the edge of each LAAM TC-CQD using the classical ninhydrin reaction21. After incubation at 60 \u00b0C for 10 min, amino acid groups react with ninhydrin, leading to the formation of the purple-coloured product diketohydrindylidene diketohydrindamine, also known as Ruhemann\u2019s purple (RP), which has a maximum absorption at 570 nm. By measuring the absorption of RP, one can therefore calculate the amount of amino acids. The ninhydrin reaction is unique in that the production of RP depends on the amount of primary amino acid groups on the edge but not the structure of backbone, which we confirmed by testing six different amino acids, including aspartic acid, glutamic acid, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and glycine (Supplementary Fig. 7a). We found that the absorption of RP is linearly correlated with the amount of amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 7b). We analysed LAAM TC-CQDs using the ninhydrin reaction and found that treatment with ninhydrin generated a new adsorption peak at 570 nm (Supplementary Fig. 7c), suggesting the presence of \u03b1-amino acid groups on the edge. A calculation based on the correlation between amino acids and absorption revealed that there are about eight amino acid groups at the edge of each LAAM TC-CQD. We next determined the chemical composition of LAAM TC-CQDs using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum. XPS survey spectrum analysis suggested the presence of C, N and O in LAAM TC-CQDs with atomic percentages of 72.43%, 12.25% and 15.32%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 8). The deconvoluted C1s spectrum revealed that there are three different types of carbon atoms, including graphitic and aliphatic (C=C and C\u2013C), oxygenated (C\u2013O, C=O and O\u2013C=O) and N-containing (C\u2013N, C=N and N\u2013C=O) (Supplementary Fig. 9). The deconvoluted N1s spectrum showed three peaks at 399.0, 399.9 and 400.8 eV (Supplementary Fig. 10), which correspond to C\u2013N, N\u2013H and C=N, respectively. FT-IR spectrum analysis identified stretching vibrations for N\u2013H (3,298 cm\u22121 and 3,190 cm\u22121), C=O (1,720 cm\u22121), C=N (1,624 cm\u22121), C\u2013N (1,387 cm\u22121) and C\u2013O (1,158 cm\u22121) bonds (Supplementary Fig. 11), suggesting the formation of polyaromatic structures and the presence of free carboxyl and amino groups at the edge of LAAM TC-CQDs. In the 13C-NMR spectrum, peaks between 120.0 ppm and 140.0 ppm can be ascribed to aromatic functionalities and conjugated double bonds (C=C and C=N), and peaks at 173.6 ppm, 170.2 ppm and 53.3 ppm are associated with O\u2013C=O, N\u2013C=O and C\u2013N, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 12). The obtained structural information suggests that LAAM TC-CQDs might be formed through two steps. In the first step, under the hydrothermal condition, one molecule of TAAQ reacts with two molecules of CA, resulting a rigid carbon skeleton that consists of three benzene rings fused to four pyridine rings. Subsequently, the skeletons act as building blocks and undergo dehydration and decarboxylation, leading to the formation of LAAM TC-CQDs with high N doping in the large rigid \u03c0-conjugated structure and free \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups at the edge (Fig. 1a). Together with the physical properties of LAAM TC-CQDs, which we determined using TEM and HRTEM, we determined the molecular structure of the majority of LAAM TC-CQDs (Fig. 1a), which is consistent with a theoretical calculation using density functional theory (DFT) simulation (B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)) (Supplementary Fig. 13, Supplementary Table 1). On the basis of the structural information and size distribution, we calculated that the number average molecular mass (Mn) of LAAM TC-CQDs is 6,102.4 g mol\u22121, the weight average molecular mass (Mw) is 62,78.3 g mol\u22121 and the polydispersity index\u2014which is calculated as Mw/Mn\u2014is 1.03. The polydispersity index is close to 1 (monodisperse), suggesting that the LAAM TC-CQDs are highly uniform.",

A detailed list of the cells used in this study is provided in Supplementary Table 4. Using laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM), we found that LAAM TC-CQDs penetrated all of the tested cancer cells, including HeLa and A549 cells, regardless of their origin or stemness. By contrast, LAAM TC-CQDs have a limited ability to penetrate non-cancerous cells, such as CCC-ESF-1 cells. This finding was confirmed using flow-cytometry analysis (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Figs. 19\u201324). Quantification analysis showed that ~99% of cancer cells (all except one BCSC line, for which the rate was 95%) were positive for LAAM TC-CQDs, whereas the rate for non-cancerous cells was limited to <30% (average of 13%; Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 4). LCSM analysis found that a significant fraction of LAAM TC-CQDs entered the nuclei, which was demonstrated by the overlap of LAAM TC-CQD fluorescence and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluorescence. We further monitored the intracellular location of LAAM TC-CQDs over time after incubation with HeLa cells. We found that the majority of LAAM TC-CQDs localized on the cell membrane after 1 h and then entered the cytoplasm. After 6 h, a significant portion of LAAM TC-CQDs had entered the nuclei. By 8 h, the concentration of LAAM TC-CQDs in the nuclei exceeded the concentration of LAAM TC-CQDs in the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. 25, Supplementary Video 1). We used the same procedures to monitor the interaction between LAAM TC-CQDs and non-cancerous CCC-ESF-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 26, Supplementary Video 2). Consistent with our observations using LCSM and flow cytometry, we did not detect interaction between LAAM TC-CQDs and representative non-cancerous CCC-ESF-1 cells throughout the entire time window of 48 h.",

LAAM TC-CQDs were injected intravenously into mice bearing HeLa tumours at 5 mg kg\u22121. At 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h and 10 h after injection, the mice were analysed using fluorescence\u2013PA imaging. Figure 2c showed that fluorescence in the tumour region gradually increased over time and peaked at 8 h, whereas fluorescence in other regions was not observed. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of fluorescence images confirmed that LAAM TC-CQDs selectively imaged tumours but not normal tissues (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Video 3). The high degree of selectivity was validated by ex vivo imaging of isolated organs and tumours, which showed that the fluorescence signal in tumours was substantially greater than that of normal organs (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 27). Consistent with our finding using fluorescence imaging, the average PA intensity in tumours increased continuously over time until 8 h after injection, when the PA signal was predominantly concentrated in tumours (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 28). To exclude the possibility that the observed tumour specificity is unique to HeLa tumours, we evaluated LAAM TC-CQDs in four additional tumour xenografts derived from A549 cells, PANC-1 cells, MCF-7 cells and MD-MBA-231 cells, respectively. We found that LAAM TC-CQDs imaged tumours in all of the tested models, with a kinetics and specificity similar to those observed in the HeLa model (Supplementary Figs. 29 and 30). To further validate the tumour specificity, we evaluated LAAM TC-CQDs in mice bearing a A549 lung carcinoma on the left flank and a HeLa ovarian tumour on the right flank. LAAM TC-CQDs penetrated both tumours with a comparable specificity (Supplementary Figs. 31 and 32).",

G-CQDs22, Y-CQDs24, B-CQDs23 and B,S-CQDs17 were synthesized as examples. We incubated these four previously reported CQDs with a panel of cancer and non-cancerous cells, and we assayed specificity using flow cytometry. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 33 and 34, all of the tested CQDs penetrate both cancer and non-cancerous cells without selectivity. After cell penetration, most of the CQDs were localized in the cytoplasm. G-CQDs were selected and further evaluated in mice bearing HeLa tumours. The experiments were performed according to the same procedures that were used in the LAAM TC-CQDs study. A 3D reconstruction of fluorescence images suggested that, in addition to the tumours, there was fluorescence signal in the liver, lungs and kidneys (Supplementary Fig. 35, Supplementary Video 4). Ex vivo imaging showed that the fluorescence intensities in the lungs and kidneys were substantially greater than those in the tumour (Supplementary Fig. 36). We evaluated whether the traditional CQDs could be engineered to reach the degree of tumour specificity observed in LAAM TC-CQDs through conjugation of tumour-targeting ligands. We synthesized G-CQDs with surface conjugation of folic acid (FA) according to our previously published procedures23. The resulting CQDs, termed FA-G-CQDs, were evaluated in mice bearing both HeLa and A549 tumours. HeLa tumours, but not A549 tumours, are known to overexpress the FA receptor26,30. As expected, we found that FA conjugation enhanced the accumulation of FA-G-CQDs in HeLa tumours, but not in A549 tumours (Supplementary Fig. 37), suggesting that the ligand-conjugation approach primarily enhances the targeting efficiency of CQDs for receptor-expressing tumours. Although the fluorescence signal in HeLa tumours was greater than that of other organs, we observed significant levels of fluorescence signal in the liver, lungs and kidneys, which was confirmed by ex vivo imaging (Supplementary Fig. 38).",

We found that the fluorescence emission spectrum of LAAM TC-CQDs remained unchanged in all of the tested conditions (Supplementary Fig. 39).

None of the tested conditions\u2014including storage at room temperature for 3 months, continuous irradiation with a 500 W xenon lamp for 12 h and continuous ultraviolet irradiation at 365 nm for 5 h\u2014 notably altered the fluorescence emission spectrum (Supplementary Figs. 40 and 41a).

            "text": "To investigate the manner in which cells uptake LAAM TC-CQDs, we treated HeLa cells with an excess of Leu, Phe or Gly before adding LAAM TC-CQDs. In contrast to Gly, Leu and Phe are both high-affinity substrates of LAT1 (ref. 33). We found that the uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs was substantially inhibited by Leu and Phe but not by Gly (Fig. 3a). On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that LAAM TC-CQDs penetrate cancer cells through interaction with LAT1. This hypothetical mechanism is supported by six lines of evidence. First, pretreatment with the LAT1 inhibitor BCH considerably reduces the uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs by HeLa cells (Fig. 3a). Quantification using flow cytometry showed that pretreatment with BCH reduced the cellular uptake rates from ~99% to ~20% across all of the tested cell lines, including HeLa, A549, PANC-1, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231 SP cells (Supplementary Fig. 43). Second, LAT1 knockout, which was generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\u2013Cas9 and western blotting, markedly reduced the uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs by HeLa cells by ~80% (Fig. 3b\u2013d, Supplementary Fig. 44). Third, overexpressing LAT1 in HeLa cells through lentiviral transduction enhanced the cellular uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs in vitro (Fig. 3e). Fourth, the expression level of LAT1 correlated with the amount of LAAM TC-CQDs that penetrated cells in various cell lines (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. 45, Supplementary Table 5). Consistent with previous reports, the level of LAT1 expression in cancer cells was substantially greater than that in non-cancerous cells11,13,14. Fifth, the overexpression of LAT1 in HeLa tumours enhanced the uptake LAAM TC-CQDs by 4.9-fold in vivo (Fig. 3g). Sixth, in an in vivo competition study, pretreatment with Leu reduced the accumulation of LAAM TC-CQDs in tumours by 42% (Fig. 3h).",

To measure the total binding, cells were treated with various concentrations of LAAM TC-CQDs. After 60 min, the cells were washed, collected and analysed for uptake on the basis of fluorescence intensities using flow cytometry. To determine the non-specific binding, cells were pretreated with BCH at 5 mM followed by treatment with LAAM TC-CQD and then analysed using flow cytometry. LAT1-dependent uptake was obtained by subtracting the non-specific binding from the total binding. By fitting the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation to the data using weighted nonlinear least squares (Supplementary Fig. 46b), we determined that the binding affinity Km was 1.4 \u03bcM, which is comparable to the value determined by surface plasmon resonance.",

            "text": "Next, we investigated whether the internalization of LAAM TC-CQDs is mediated by LAT1-dependent transport or endocytosis. First, we performed docking analysis to identify the part of the LAT1 structure that LAAM CQDs bind to. Using the AutoDock Lamarckian Genetic algorithm, we simulated the interaction between LAAM TC-CQDs and the LAT1\u20134F2hc (CD98) heteromeric complex34. We found that LAAM TC-CQDs bind to LAT1 on the edge through hydrogen bonds formed between the amino acid groups in LAAM TC-CQDs and the Lys 77, Asn 242, Leu 238, Trp 452 and Lys 77 residues in LAT1 (Supplementary Fig. 47a). The rigid sp2-conjugate hydrophobic plane is also involved the binding (Supplementary Fig. 47b). We calculated that the docking energy is E = \u22122.07 kcal mol\u22121. No specific interaction between LAAM TC-CQDs and 4F2hc was found, suggesting that 4F2hc might not be essential for the LAT1-mediated internalization of CQDs. Furthermore, simulation using AutoDock did not find direct interactions between LAAM TC-CQDs and the internal LAT1 binding pocket. Collectively, these findings suggest that uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs probably does not occur through LAT1-mediated transport. Second, we evaluated the internalization of LAAM TC-CQDs in the presence of endocytic-trafficking inhibitors, including chlorpromazine and genistein, which inhibit clathrin- and caveolin-dependent endocytosis, respectively35. BCH was included as a control. We found that both chlorpromazine and BCH inhibited LAAM TC-CQD internalization by around 80%. By contrast, genistein did not notably inhibit the uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs (Supplementary Fig. 48). These results suggest that the internalization of LAAM TC-CQDs is mediated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Third, we measured the transport of LAAM TC-CQDs in cells by continuous fluorescence monitoring in the presence or absence of BCH. We found that, in the absence of BCH, intracellular fluorescence increased over time for the first 6 h, after which no further significant increase was observed. In the presence of BCH, there was little intracellular fluorescence throughout the entire time course (Supplementary Fig. 49). The kinetics of CQD internalization is consistent with the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis36,37. Fourth, we measured the change in the intracellular concentration of LAAM TC-CQDs after incubation using LCSM. We found that the concentration of LAAM TC-CQDs within cells was substantially lower than the concentration of LAAM TC-CQDs outside of cells 12 h after incubation (Supplementary Fig. 50). This observation supports the possibility that LAAM TC-CQDs are probably internalized through LAT1-mediated endocytosis. Finally, we determined whether efflux of LAAM TC-CQDs can be induced by the addition of Leu, a LAT1 substrate. According to the antiport mechanism, the addition of LAT1 substrates should induce efflux of LAAM CQDs if they are internalized through transport. LAAM TC-CQDs were added to HeLa cells at 10 \u03bcg ml\u22121. After 12 h, the medium containing LAAM TC-CQDs was removed and replaced with medium containing leucine at 10 \u03bcg ml\u22121. After an additional 2 h, the cells were collected and analysed using flow cytometry. We found that external addition of leucine did not induce efflux of LAAM TC-CQDs (Supplementary Fig. 51), suggesting that LAAM TC-CQDs are probably not internalized through transport. Collectively, these data suggest that LAAM TC-CQDs are internalized through LAT1-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",

The efficacy of DNA-damaging chemotherapy drugs, which function through interactions with DNA within the nuclei, are often further reduced by their limited ability to penetrate the nucleus38. Those limitations can potentially be overcome by using LAAM TC-CQDs as a drug carrier. First, LAAM TC-CQDs have considerable tumour-specific targeting, making it possible to avoid systemic toxicity. Second, owing to their nanoscopic size, LAAM TC-CQDs may not be removed by ABC transporters39,40. Third, LAAM TC-CQDs efficiently penetrate the nucleus, making it possible to maximize the efficacy of DNA-damaging chemotherapy.",

LAAM TC-CQDs have large \u03c0-conjugated structures that enable the loading of aromatic chemotherapy drugs\u2014such as topotecan hydrochloride (TPTC), DOX and hydroxycamptothecin\u2014through a \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction (Supplementary Fig. 52). We further evaluated TPTC-loaded LAAM TC-CQDs (TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs), which were synthesized by mixing LAAM TC-CQDs with TPTC overnight followed with extensive dialysis. Successful loading of TPTC was evidenced by the characteristic ultraviolet\u2013vis absorbance peak at 390 nm that is superimposed on the absorption spectrum of LAAM TC-CQDs (Supplementary Fig. 52a). The slight redshift of the absorption peak of TPTC after loading could be attributed to the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0-stacking interaction between TPTC and LAAM TC-CQDs. TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs have dual fluorescence emissions that correspond to TPTC (Supplementary Fig. 53, yellow channel) and LAAM TC-CQDs (Fig. 1d, red channel). We characterized the interaction between TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs and a panel of cancer cells and non-cancerous cells. The TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs retained the selective penetrability to tested HeLa and A549 cancer cells, and delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs eliminates the penetration of TPTC to non-cancerous CCC-ESF-1cells (Fig. 4a). On the basis of fluorescence intensity, delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs enhanced the accumulation of TPTC in the nuclei by 4.5-fold and 5.2-fold for HeLa and A549 cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 54).",

            "text": "Next, we characterized TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs for the treatment of HeLa tumours. Delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs markedly enhanced the toxicity of TPTC to HeLa cells but reduced its toxicity to non-cancerous cells (Fig. 4b). At a concentration equivalent to 5 \u00b5g ml\u22121 TPTC, TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs killed all HeLa cells but did not exhibit toxicity to non-cancerous CCC-ESF-1 cells. By contrast, free TPTC at the same concentration inhibited both cells at a comparable efficiency. The reduced toxicity to normal cells is probably because LAAM TC-CQDs, along with the cargo TPTC, cannot penetrate normal cells (Fig. 4a). Without the ability to penetrate cells, TPTC cannot exert its toxicity, as it functions in the nuclei. We determined the pharmacokinetics of TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs in mice bearing HeLa tumours. For comparison, TPTC-loaded liposomes\u2014designated as TPTC\u2013liposomes\u2014were synthesized using a molar ratio of 56:39:5 HSPC:cholesterol:PEG 2000-DSPE (Supplementary Fig. 55). The same lipid composition was used in several FDA-approved liposomal formulations, including Doxil41. TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs and control free TPTC or TPTC\u2013liposomes were administered intravenously at a dose equivalent to 2 mg kg\u22121 TPTC. The blood was collected at various time points. TPTC in the plasma was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. As shown in Fig. 4c, delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs substantially enhanced the blood circulation and bioavailability of TPTC; the half-life of TPTC increased from 5.4 min to 40.1 min and the area under the curve (AUC) increased from 13.4 to 138.1. By contrast, the half-life and AUC of TPTC\u2013liposomes were 11.8 min and 55.1, respectively (Fig. 4c). We next examined the biodistribution of TPTC in a second cohort of mice that received the same treatment. As expected, free TPTC was widely distributed over the body without specificity. By contrast, TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs exhibited kinetics similar to the kinetics of LAAM TC-CQDs (Supplementary Fig. 56). By 8 h, TPTC could be detected only in tumours. Ex vivo imaging of isolated organs confirmed that LAAM TC-CQDs enabled highly specific delivery of TPTC to tumours (Supplementary Fig. 57). Quantification on the basis of TPTC fluorescence intensity showed that delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs increased the concentration of TPTC in tumours by 16.7-fold while substantially reducing the accumulation of TPTC in other organs. The amount of LAAM TC-CQDs accumulated in the tumours accounted for 15.3% of the total injection dose. By contrast, a significant amount of TPTC\u2013liposomes were found in the liver. Delivery through the liposomes increased the concentration of TPTC in tumours by 6.7-fold (Fig. 4d). We assessed TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs for treatment of HeLa tumours. When tumour volumes reached around 100 mm3, the mice were randomly grouped and received intravenous administration of saline, TPTC (2 mg kg\u22121), TPTC\u2013liposomes or TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs (TPTC\u2013liposomes and TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs at a dose equivalent to 2 mg kg\u22121 TPTC) at days 1, 4, 8 and 12. At day 27, tumours in the mice receiving TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs treatment shrank to an undetectable level (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 58). By contrast, tumours in the mice receiving free TPTC or TPTC\u2013liposomes continuously grew, although at rates that were slower than that of the control mice (Fig. 4e). Tumour growth curves for individual tumour-bearing mice are provided in Supplementary Fig. 59. All of the mice treated with TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs survived over 50 d. However, the median survival times for mice treated with saline, TPTC and TPTC\u2013liposomes were limited to 25 d, 30 d and 35 d, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 59).",

Consistent with this finding, haematoxylin and eosin analysis of major organs isolated from normal mice receiving TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQD treatment did not detect inflammatory infiltration or pathological damage. However, apparent myocardial fibre rupture, diffuse ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, pulmonary hyperaemia and focal tubular necrosis were found in mice that were treated with free TPTC (Supplementary Fig. 61).

Consistent with our findings in HeLa and A549 cells, TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs demonstrated a substantially greater cytotoxicity to U87 cells compared with the free TPTC (Fig. 5f). Delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs enhanced the delivery of TPTC to tumours by 16.7-fold (Fig. 5g) and increased the half-life and AUC of TPTC in the blood by 10.1-fold (from 4.8 min to 48.6 min) and 12.2-fold (from 23.9 to 290.9; Supplementary Fig. 65b), respectively. By contrast, TPTC\u2013liposomes failed to demonstrate comparable enhancement effects (Fig. 5f,g, Supplementary Fig. 65b). We further analysed the therapeutic benefits of TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs for treating U87 brain tumours. Two weeks after tumour inoculation, mice were randomly grouped and treated with TPTC (2 mg kg\u22121) or TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs or TPTC\u2013liposomes (both at a dose equivalent to 2 mg kg\u22121 TPTC), administered three times a week for two weeks. Treatment with TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQDs effectively enhanced the survival of tumour-bearing mice to 16 d, which was substantially greater than the survival of the mice that were treated with free TPTC (3 d) and TPTC\u2013liposomes (4 d; P < 0.001; Fig. 5h). Furthermore, TPTC\u2013LAAM TC-CQD-treated mice did not decrease in weight over the course of treatment, whereas both free-TPTC-treated and TPTC\u2013liposome-treated mice did (Supplementary Fig. 65c).",

            "text": "To determine the molecular structure that accounts for the tumour specificity observed in LAAM TC-CQDs, we systematically analysed an array of LAAM TC-CQD analogues. First, we determined whether the carboxyl groups or the amino groups or both are essential. We removed the carboxyl and amino groups on the edge of LAAM TC-CQDs through hydrazine hydrate (NH2\u2013NH2) reduction24 and a carbodiimide (EDC)\u2013N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) coupling reaction with acetic acid23, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 66\u201368). The resulting NH2- and COOH-null LAAM TC-CQDs were evaluated in HeLa and CCC-ESF-1 cells. The removal of either carboxyl or amino groups abolished the tumour-specific penetrability of LAAM TC-CQDs, and the resulting CQDs penetrated both cancer and non-cancerous cells without selectivity (Fig. 6a,b). Flow-cytometry analysis (Supplementary Fig. 69) revealed that, in contrast to unmodified LAAM TC-CQDs, LAAM TC-CQDs without NH2 groups and COOH groups had 46% and 48% reduced uptake in HeLa cells, respectively, and 414% and 613% increased uptake non-cancerous CCC-ESF-1 cells (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, we found that, consistent with previous reports44\u201346, ultraviolet irradiation at 365 nm for 5 h deoxidized the surface of CQDs, leading to a significant reduction in the amount of amino acid groups (Supplementary Fig. 41b) and, as a consequence, the remaining LAAM TC-CQDs lost most of their cancer-targeting specificity (Supplementary Fig. 41c). We next tested whether the presence of a carboxyl group and an amino group on the same \u03b1 position is essential. 2,6-CQDs, which bear the same number of carboxyl and amino groups, were synthesized using 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (2,6-DAAQ) and CA and were analysed for their structure and optical properties (Supplementary Figs. 70\u201375, Supplementary Table 6). All of the carboxyl and amino groups of 2,6-CQDs are located in different positions relative to LAAM TC-CQDs. LCSM and flow-cytometry analysis showed that the altered carboxyl and amino positions results in a complete loss of tumour-specific penetrability; 2,6-CQDs penetrate both HeLa and CCC-ESF-1 cells with comparable efficiency (Fig. 6a\u2013c, Supplementary Fig. 76). We assessed whether the number of paired \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups is associated with tumour-specific penetrability. 1,4-CQDs and 1,5-CQDs were synthesized under the same conditions as LAAM TC-CQDs while TAAQ was replaced with 1,4-diaminoanthraquinone (1,4-DAAQ) or 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone (1,5-DAAQ). Both CQDs were analysed for their structure and optical properties (Supplementary Figs. 70\u201375, Supplementary Table 6). 1,4-CQDs, which are structurally similar to LAAM TC-CQDs but bear half as many paired groups, maintained tumour-specific penetrability (Fig. 6a). However, the penetration efficiency of 1,4-CQDs was substantially reduced to 61% of the penetration efficiency of LAAM TC-CQDs (Fig. 6b,c). 1,5-CQDs, which are also structurally similar to LAAM TC-CQDs and bear the same number of paired groups, penetrated HeLa cells with efficiency that was comparable to LAAM TC-CQDs (Fig. 6a\u2013c). Finally, we determined whether the backbone structure of LAAM TC-CQDs is important for its function. We synthesized Phe-CQDs, which bear paired \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups but have a substantially different backbone from LAAM TC-CQDs, using Phe and analysed their structure and optical properties (Supplementary Figs. 77\u201380). We found that Phe-CQDs maintained the tumour-specific penetrability in HeLa and CCC-ESF-1 cells, although the uptake of Phe-CQDs in HeLa cells was 36% of that of LAAM TC-CQDs (Fig. 6a\u2013c, Supplementary Fig. 81). The low penetrability of Phe-CQDs might be attributed to the poor water solubility of Phe-CQDs, which resulted in low dispersion in solution.",

We demonstrated that LAAM TC-CQDs are capable of imaging tumours with high selectivity (Fig. 2). The high degree of selectivity is probably because LAAM TC-CQDs efficiently penetrate cancer cells but not most normal cells (Figs. 2 and 4). Therefore, after intravenous administration, LAAM TC-CQDs are expected to accumulate in tumours and penetrate into tumour cells through interactions with LAT1. By contrast, the CQDs cannot penetrate normal cells and, as a consequence, are eliminated from normal tissues through rapid kidney excretion (Supplementary Fig. 64). Owing to its high specificity to tumours and intrinsic optical properties, LAAM TC-CQDs have great potential to be used for tumour imaging as well as for image-guided surgery.",

            "text": "Second, LAAM TC-CQDs are capable of targeted drug delivery to tumours with a high degree of specificity and efficiency. This cannot be achieved through the conjugation of traditional tumour-targeting ligands, which has also been shown to fail to considerably improve tumour-targeting efficiency4. Consistent with these findings, we found that conjugation of ligands enhanced the delivery of CQDs to some tumours, but not others, and did not substantially reduce their non-specific accumulation in normal tissues (Supplementary Fig. 38). Tumour-targeting ligands have previously been tested for LAT1-mediated drug delivery to tumours through conjugation of aspartate16. It was found that LAT1 targeting improved the accumulation of DOX in tumours by threefold to sixfold. However, a comparable amount of DOX was also found in the liver. By contrast, we found that delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs enhanced the accumulation of TPTC in tumours by 16.7-fold, while the accumulation of TPTC in the liver was reduced to a barely detectable level (1.8% of that in the tumours; Fig. 4d). The observed difference between these two studies may be because LAAM TC-CQDs and aspartate have different affinities with LAT1. We found that the specificity of LAAM CQDs is correlated with the number of paired \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups on the edge (Fig. 6). It seems that the local high density of \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups triggers a multivalent, strong interaction with LAT1. As a result, delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs, which bear lots of \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups, markedly enhances the penetration of TPTC into tumour cells. As most normal tissues do not express LAT1, LAAM TC-CQDs cannot penetrate normal cells and are quickly eliminated from the circulatory system (Fig. 2b). In contrast to LAAM CQDs, aspartate has only one pair of \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups and, as a result, the interaction between aspartate-conjugated DOX and LAT1 could be weak owing to a lack of multivalency. As a consequence, aspartate-conjugated DOX has a low affinity for tumour cells and can non-specifically penetrate normal cells, leading to high accumulation in normal organs16.",

Over the past few decades, we have witnessed significant improvements in the treatments for many types of cancers; however, for solid tumours of the brain, the prognosis remains dismal. The limited progress in the treatment of brain cancer can be largely attributed to the BBB. Although the vasculature of the tumour core tends to be leaky, the BBB is nearly intact in the capillaries that feed the proliferating tumour edge and the surrounding brain tissue and, unfortunately, enhancing drug delivery to brain tumours through traditional ligand-mediated delivery has not been successful8,9. The existence of the BBB has also limited the ability to image tumours in the brain, particularly those infiltrating tumour cells located in the region where the BBB is largely intact and where imaging contrast agents cannot be delivered in sufficient quantities48. Here we have shown that LAAM CQDs\u2014through their interaction with LAT1, which is a target expressed in both the BBB and in tumour cells\u2014are capable of imaging and delivering therapeutic agents to tumours in the brain with high specificity and efficiency.",
