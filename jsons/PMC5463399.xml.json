The intracellular appearance of naked DNA molecules triggers a double-stranded (ds)DNA sensing mechanism which consequently induces innate immune responses including the production and release of type I interferons (IFN-I). This response is central to the resolution of DNA-induced cellular stress [2\u20134] and prevents the emergence of autoimmunity [4, 5]. A recently described protein named STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes, also known as TMEM173, ERIS, MITA and MPYS) is a critical regulator of these innate immune responses [6\u20139].",

Suppression of components of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex such as TRAP-\u03b2 and Sec61 \u03b2 have been found to impair DNA-induced type I interferon (IFN-I) signals downstream of STING [11]. The TRAP complex has been shown to be involved in two of the ER\u2019s major responses: protein N-glycosylation [12] and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) [13]. Although the functional relevance of STING in the ER translocon system has not yet been fully elucidated, it has been proposed that STING can interact with TRAP component Ssr2/TRAP\u03b2 to enable its migration from the ER to perinuclear membranes, a process key to IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation [6, 14].",

            "text": "Recent reports have demonstrated that cytoplasmic DNA released by microbes and viruses can trigger dsDNA-sensing pathways which activate STING [6, 15\u201317]. STING then signals to the TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) / interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) axis to upregulate type I interferon production [11, 18]. As an IKK (I\u03baB kinase) \u2013related kinase, TBK1 can also interact with I\u03baB kinases to induce phosphorylation and thus degradation of I\u03baB, thereby liberating NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa B) subunits allowing their nuclear translocation resulting in upregulation of type I interferon and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 (interleukin-6), CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine 10), CCL5 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 5) and CCL2 [19]. Table 1 summarises the pathogens that have been shown to activate STING [6, 20\u201337]. Of note, STING knockout mice generated by Ishikawa and Barber were highly susceptible to infection by the single stranded RNA viruses vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sendai virus [6], suggesting STING activation pathways may overlap with RNA sensing mechanisms or reverse transcription of viral RNA [6, 24, 38].\n",

            "text": "Whilst STING acts as an adaptor protein in the dsDNA sensing pathway, it is not activated directly by DNA molecules. Instead, STING responds to DNA sensing proteins and molecules known as cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) [35, 47\u201349] (Figure 1). CDNs are derived from infectious agents exogenously, or are produced by the mammalian dsDNA sensor cGAS (cyclic guanosine monophosphate \u2013 adenosine monophosphate synthase; cyclic GMP-AMP synthase). The canonical CDNs, or microbial secretory CDNs, are molecules made of 3\u2032-5\u2032 phosphodiester bonds joining two adenosines (A) \u2013 cyclic di-AMP [35, 50], two guanosines (G) \u2013 cyclic di-GMP [47] or one of each \u2013 cyclic GMP-AMP [37]. One of the STING-activating universally expressed DNA sensors, cGAS, is capable of catalysing a unique form of CDN endogenously upon DNA recognition [51]. This molecule is comprised of one 3\u2032-5\u2032 phosphodiester bond and a non-canonical 2\u2032-5\u2032 linkage between adenosine and guanosine, and is thus named 2\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP to distinguish from the secretory cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP (3\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP) which contains two 3\u2032-5\u2032 bonds [37]. Previous literature [52\u201354] has suggested that 2\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP is ten- to a thousand-fold more potent than 3\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP in activating STING. A number of studies reported that the change of phosphodiester linkage in 2\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP results in a higher binding affinity to STING and thus leads to an augmented type I interferon response [55, 56]. It is also possible that hydrophilic secretory cyclic dinucleotides are excluded by the selectively permeable plasma membrane [57], and thus cannot be recognised by STING.\n",

IFI16, as well as its mouse orthologue p204, is a universally expressed DNA sensor, which forms multimers prior to STING activation in response to HSV viral infections [15, 60]. Evidence shows that IFI16 is responsible for detecting foreign DNA both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus and therefore it is capable of combating nuclear-replicating viruses such as Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma associated herpesvirus [61, 62] and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [27, 63], implying an ability to discriminate between \u201cself\u201d and \u201cnon-self\u201d DNA molecules. A recent report by Diner and colleagues showed dynamic regulation of IFI16 oligomers at different cellular compartments in response to altered viral infections [64]. Throughout HCMV infection, IFI16 oligomers are densely gathered nuclear \u201cpunctate\u201d structures, whereas in Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection these \u201cpuncta\u201d become gradually dispersed across the whole nucleoplasm and are eventually degraded. In contrast to previous studies, Diner et al. also found that IFI16 knockout cells do not impede TBK1 activation upon immune stimulation, whereas both STING and cGAS knockout cells will strongly suppress TBK1 activity, suggesting that nuclear DNA detection mediated by IFI16 is independent of the STING/TBK-1/IRF3 axis. Other studies indicate that antiviral cytokine production occurs in the absence of IFI16 via an unknown mechanism [64].",

It was shown that HSV infection can induce both DNA sensors in various cell types, and that cGAS is partially nuclear, thus is able to regulate the stability of nuclear IFI16 oligomers during detection of viral DNA [65]. This provides a molecular mechanism by which cGAS regulates nuclear DNA sensing. Further evidence also suggests a DNA dose-dependent interaction between IFI16 and cGAS in keratinocytes [66]. Although this interaction does not affect cGAS\u2019s ability to generate cyclic dinucleotides, evidence indicates that IFI16 can facilitate the detection of these ligands by STING, and the loss of IFI16 can significantly impair downstream type I interferon and pro-inflammatory signalling [66]. Therefore, IFI16 and cGAS are not redundant during DNA infections, but instead cooperate and regulate each other\u2019s activities.",

Complementary DNA (cDNA) produced from reverse transcription of negative-stranded RNA in retroviruses such as HIV, murine leukemia virus (MLV) and Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can induce a cGAS-dependent DNA sensing pathway and STING activation [28, 68] (Figure 1). However, HIV, in particular, is capable of inhibiting transcription of immediate anti-retroviral factors [69] and exploits the host STING blocker NOD-like receptor NLRX1 to aid the establishment of virus latency [67, 69]. It was also reported that cationic liposomes and nucleic acid-free herpesvirus-derived virus-like particles can directly induce STING/TBK1 relocation regardless of DNA sensing pathways, suggesting that the membrane fusion mechanism may be an alternative route for enveloped DNA and RNA viruses to activate STING. Enveloped RNA virus Influenza A virus has been shown to release haemagglutinin fusion peptide which induces STING but not cGAS activation [29], thus indicating another STING activation mechanism independent of cyclic dinucleotide recognition. It remains unclear whether the fusion particles alone are direct STING ligands or if activity requires facilitation by unidentified co-regulator(s).",

            "text": "The RNA-inducing adaptor MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein; also known as VISA, Cardif, IPS-1) can also interact with and activate STING [6, 8] (Figure 1). The mitochondria-resident adaptor MAVS is the major molecular platform through which the RLR-dependent RNA sensing pathway elicits the type I interferon response. MAVS responds to the cytoplasmic RNA sensors RIG-I (the retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5) [70], and in turn induces proinflammatory transcription factors NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7 [70\u201373]. Castenier and colleagues [74] found that RIG-I induced MAVS activation can modulate mitochondrial dynamic changes promoting signalling to STING at MAMs, \u201cmitochondria-associated membranes\u201d, where mitochondria and ER are closely associated [75]. This adaptor interaction was found to be dependent on a mitochondrial fusion mechanism which induces mitochondrial elongation towards the ER, and hence MAM formation. Virus-induced mitochondria fragmentation disrupts membrane association and hence abolishes MAVS activation and secondary STING signalling [74]. Another report also suggests that RNA virus-induced release of stress-associated mitochondrial (mt)DNA activates the STING-dependent dsDNA sensing pathway [76]. This process, which is also likely to involve mitochondrial stress-induced apoptosis, may provide an effective means to remove damaged cells for infection control.",

Yet many autophagy-related proteins such as autophagy-related gene (Atg) 9a and Vps34 are key to STING inter-organelle trafficking [79], and that the loss of early autophagy marker LC3 II can significantly impair the STING-dependent innate response to viral and bacterial infections [79\u201381]. This autophagy-like behaviour could also be related to the ER-originated pre-autophagosome formation, where STING is located [41].",

STING activation first induces adaptor dimerisation [82] and TRIM56-dependent ubiquitination to enable TBK1 docking [83]. Together, STING and TBK1 migrate to the perinuclear membranes of the Golgi via autophagy-like processes [6, 18, 79]. The association between STING-TBK1 leads to auto-phosphorylation of TBK1 at S172, a residue known to induce TBK1 activation [84, 85]. This further allows TBK1 to phosphorylate STING at S358 and S366 (S357 and S365, respectively, in mouse STING). Phosphorylated S366, together with L374, are important for the recruitment of IRF3 in close proximity to TBK1 at the C-terminus of STING, thereby enabling TBK1 to phosphorylate and activate IRF3 by exposing its nuclear localisation signal [18]. Activated IRF3 then translocates into the nucleus and promotes expression of type I interferons. Via a rapid feedback mechanism, IFN-I is released and binds to cell surface interferon receptors (IFN\u03b1Rs), which then induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) via Tyk2/JAK1 [86\u201388] and STAT1-STAT2 dimers [89, 90].\n",

The mechanism of this was found to be dependent on STING-TBK1 activation, which in turn regulates the activation loop of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 releasing p65 to form active dimers with p50. Hence, the functional NF-\u03baB complex can translocate into the nucleus and promote transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. Abe and Barber also suggested that TRAF6 may be involved upstream of TBK1, which likely facilitates NF-kB activation [19]. However, the IFI16-dependent STING pathway can only induce IRF3 but not NF-\u03baB activation, which would serve to preserve the survival activities regardless of the antiviral response during infection [91].",

Whilst this may not lead to dramatic differences in their three-dimensional structures, the structural differences at certain amino acid residues may be responsible for species-specific immune responses to some viral infections. For instance, Dengue virus (DENV) can inhibit STING signalling in human but not in mouse [107, 109]. DENV encodes for the protease NS2B3 that cleaves human STING at a highly-conserved putative cysteine motif (C88XXC91) to disable the adaptor. The equivalent cleavage target in mouse STING (mSTING) harbours a mutation that prevents NS2B3 cleavage, thus mouse STING can avoid DENV evasion. Mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts transfected with hSTING re-constructed with a mouse NS2B3 cleavage site sequence blocks the type I interferon response against DENV. Specifically, a substitution of S135A in hSTING sequence results in inhibition of NS2B3 cleavage, suggesting that protecting STING at this residue may provide the basis for a novel anti-Dengue treatment [107].",

Substitution at R284M can greatly stabilize the STING dimer, indicating its strong potential to cause chronic STING-dependent autoimmunity [103]. Substitution at R293Q can strongly reduce the c-di-GMP \u2013induced IFN-I signals and completely abolishes the signals induced by other 3\u2032-5\u2032 bond cyclic dinucleotides [104]. Other single residue polymorphisms such as R232H and G230A may affect the ligand binding pocket of STING, thereby reducing its response to bacterial ligands [104]. In particular, a loss-of-function triple STING mutant, R71H-G230A-R293Q (named HAQ), abolishes almost 90% of the interferon response to all cyclic dinucleotides [110]. The HAQ mutant occurs in one-fifth of the population from a thousand genome screen [104]. Homologous HAQ mutant knock-in mice have demonstrated that a variety of immune cells, including lymphocytes and Ly6Chi monocytes, express significantly less STING protein compared to the wildtype, and the mutant animals completely failed to respond to CDN challenge [106]. This suggested that the HAQ mutant may be a de facto null allele of STING, thereby reducing the availability of the STING protein to mediate a dsDNA sensing response.\n",

The human equivalent mutation I200N was also considered to have the same effects, but no such spontaneous mutant has been discovered. Only a few gain-of-function hSTING mutants have been identified clinically [39, 105] (Table 2). Patients with these STING mutations showed early on-set of severe systemic inflammation in blood vessels and various organs, displaying chronic inflammatory symptoms that are highly similar to pathologies of SLE (systemic lupus erythematous) and AGS (Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome) [39, 105]. All of these STING mutants have shown considerable structural resemblance to the active conformation, presumably leading to constitutive adaptor dimerization and signalling to type I interferon production. Both Liu and K\u00f6nig\u2019s groups suggested that inhibition of the interferon signalling adaptor JAK could significantly dampen IFN-I over-expression as measured in biopsy samples from these patients, indicating that JAK inhibitors could be a promising avenue to therapeutically control disease progression.",

Upon ligand binding, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM56 is recruited to initiate K-63 linked ubiquitination on STING, a prerequisite for STING dimerisation and activation [83]. Another E3 ligase AMFR (Autocrine motility factor receptor), together with its interacting partner INSIG1 (insulin-induced gene 1), catalyses K-27 linked poly-ubiquitination, which is critical for TBK1 recruitment [113]. In contrast, TRIM30\u03b1-dependent K275 ubiquitination [112] and RNF5 (RING finger protein 5) -dependent K150 ubiquitination [114] degrade STING dimers and negatively regulate antiviral signalling (Figure 4). This process is likely to involve the antiviral adaptor protein MAVS on mitochondria at the MAMs where the closely associated ER and mitochondrial membranes bring STING and MAVS in close proximity [115, 116]. Since ubiquitination is critical to STING regulation, some viruses can secrete proteases to specifically disrupt this process to suppress innate immune recognition, as summarised below (Table 3).\n",

One such example is the phosphorylation of S366 on the C-terminal domain to provide docking sites for IRF3 prior to its phosphorylation by TBK1 [6, 100, 117]. ULK1-dependent phosphorylation on S366 post Golgi trafficking blocks IRF3 binding to STING and thus prevents chronic STING activation [102] (Figure 4). ULK1 acts upon release from its repressor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase) which is induced by production of 2\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP from cGAS. Interestingly, both loss-of-function (S366A) and gain-of-function (S366D) mutations can abrogate IRF3 signalling [18], suggesting that either the phosphorylation of S366 is temporally and spatially regulating IRF3 docking, or that alternative post-translational modifications are responsible for this functional regulation. In particular, S366-dependent inhibition of IRF3 does not impair the NF-\u03baB pathway, indicating that these two pathways act independently of each other, which has likely evolved to prevent dysregulated antiviral responses from affecting survival activities [102].",

Both of these have been shown to sequester STING to prevent TBK1 recruitment; in particular the latter is strongly enhanced in HIV infection to suppress STING-dependent recognition of reverse-transcribed dsDNA [67]. Depletion of NLRX1 not only impedes nuclear transportation of viral DNA, but also restores the STING-mediated interferon response to stall progression of infection. This suggests that pharmacological suppression of intrinsic STING inhibitors could potentially support the re-establishment of STING-mediated innate immunity against RNA viruses, and thus may offer promising adjuvant therapy to combat retrovirus infection. However, Guo and colleagues also noted that such suppression must be finely controlled to avoid excessive inflammatory responses that may lead to autoimmunity [67].",

Recent studies on host-parasite interaction have revealed distinct roles for STING-dependent type I interferon responses during crosstalk with other pro-inflammatory pathways. CD40 receptors expressed on antigen-presenting cells are understood to initiate the cellular and humoral response of the adaptive immunity, specifically enhancing the generation of immunoglobulins against pathogens [133, 134]. Mice infected with Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis, infected red blood cells, TLR ligands or parasitic DNA/RNA upregulate both CD40 and type I interferon expression, whereas the loss of CD40 can reduce the level of STING further impairing the early type I interferon response in macrophages and dendritic cells [135]. Although CD40-induced STING upregulation leads to reduced CD40 levels and thus downstream NF-\u03baB signalling, type I interferon immunity has been suggested to be highly inducible in certain strains of parasitic infection [135].",

Yu et al. suggested that depletion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, rather than canonical dendritic cells and macrophages, can significantly impair type I interferon signalling at 24 h post Plasmodium yoelii infection [136]. The ubiquitous STING-cGAS pathway has been shown to enhance type I interferon production, and also potently induces SOCS1 to inhibit the MyD88 / IRF7-dependent type I interferon production which specifically acts on pDCs to protect against early malaria infection. The loss of STING and cGAS in mice augments the immediate type I interferon response from pDCs following malaria infection, and therefore protects the animal against early mortality [136].

For instance, several members of the Gammaherpesviridae family were found to express ORF52 protein homologs to disrupt cGAS activities, preventing subsequent production of 2\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP [48]. Species of the Flaviviridae and Coronaviviridae families tend to secrete proteases that directly cleave or block STING [140]; typical examples include the NS2B/3 and NS4B proteases released by flaviviridae Dengue virus and hepatitis C virus, respectively, which can both degrade hSTING. In particular, NS4B protease shows strong homology to the ER-embedded N-terminal domains of STING, leading to colocalisation and direct protein-protein interactions with STING [11]. It has also been suggested that tumour associated viruses such as human papillomavirus and adenovirus could potentially release oncogenic proteins to block cGAS/STING interactions with tumour suppressors, hence compromising innate immunity and supporting cancer progression [142].",

Recent research suggests that HIV-1 enhances the action of NLRX1 to dampen STING activity [67] and recruits host 3\u2032 exonuclease TREX1 to degrade excessively produced, reverse-transcribed, viral DNA thereby avoiding detection by the cGAS/STING pathway [68, 152]. The capsid of HIV also regulates its association with host protein cyclin A, which controls the masking of viral cDNA from cGAS recognition in the cytoplasm and its exposure in the nucleus to facilitate genome integration [146]. Mutations in the HIV-1 capsid sequence enhance its binding to cyclin A prematurely in the cytoplasm enabling DC sensing of double-stranded DNA and a potent innate immune response against viral infection [146].",

            "text": "A new insight into STING research was recently provided by York and colleagues who suggested that this protein is a crucial element of cholesterol metabolism [45]. Previous studies indicate that high cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane correlate with viral loads and host susceptibility to infections [190, 191]. Virus and microbial infections have been shown to modulate lipid metabolism in the plasma membrane to facilitate infectivity. For instance, influenza virus encodes fusion protein haemagglutinin that is specialised in manipulating membrane lipid to permit penetration into the cytoplasm, a central step to viral infectivity and survival [192]. In addition, membrane lipids can also form signalling microdomain named lipid rafts which are frequently hijacked by HIV for attachment, signalling and budding to further promote infection [193, 194]. The antiviral type I interferon response reduces cholesterol availability in membranes to prevent viral infection; however the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown [195\u2013197]. York\u2019s group recently identified that STING/TBK1 signalling is critical to the production of type I interferons to reprogram lipid biosynthesis in pathogenic infection [45]. They demonstrated that the shift from lipid biosynthesis to lipid uptake not only affects the plasma membrane but also ER membranes, a cue to activate STING, bypassing the dsDNA sensing pathway. However, since STING is not the only adaptor for innate immunity against pathogenic DNA in the cytoplasm, it is conceivable that additional DNA sensors may further enhance STING actions to modulate cholesterol metabolism and promote antiviral processes. In light of the membrane fusion theory that potentially mediates STING activation [198], virus-host lipid regulation at the plasma membrane offers a promising and novel future research direction.",

However, cancer cells also boost anti-inflammatory immune cells and regulatory T cells (Treg) to restrict CD8\u03b1 + DC activity thereby attenuating the activation of tumour-suppressive T cells [200, 201]. Therefore, a potent and long-acting adjuvant that can promote CD8\u03b1 + DC activities is highly desirable to enhance T cell priming and subsequent anti-tumour immunity.",

In both immunogenic and irradiation-induced tumour models, tumour-derived DNA was engulfed and recognised by the universal DNA sensor cGAS prior to STING activation [42, 43]. However, direct stimulation with STING ligands also enhanced DC production of type I interferons, suggesting that STING-inducing therapies may offer potential as anti-tumour adjuvants.",

            "text": "Preclinical studies published recently suggest that DMXAA-derived cyclic dinucleotides have been successfully applied in established mouse models of malignant tumours achieving sustained tumour regression [202]. In malignant tumour B cells, STING also induces an ER stress response through the IRE-1 / XBP-1 (X-Box binding protein 1) pathway [203]. In the presence of 3\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP STING dimers are phosphorylated and aggregate, rather than undergoing degradation. This consequently enables prolonged STING signalling to induce apoptosis of tumour cells. Similarly, Tang et al. showed administration of 3\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP induces rejection of chronic lymphotic leukemia in mouse models [203]. Another promising vaccine candidate is the recently developed STINGVAX which combines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and formulated 2\u2032-5\u2032 \u2013 3\u2032-5\u2032 linked cyclic dinucleotide [204]. In various established in vivo tumour models, STINGVAX has shown notable positive effects on dendritic cell activation and in promoting tumour-infiltrating T cells. Interestingly, activated cytotoxic T cells also upregulate the expression of PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1), which enhances the therapeutic action of pro-apoptotic ligand PD-1 to promote tumour cell death. Although these STING-based vaccines have recently been developed and have been tested in mouse models, the synergistic effect of the combined STING agonist and immune promoting therapy represents a novel strategy to combat tumours by reinforcing both adaptive immunity and anti-tumour targets.",

As previously mentioned, gain-of-function mutations in TMEM173 (the gene encoding STING) underlie type I interferonopathies that manifest in the autoimmune diseases, SAVI [39] and FCL [105]. Constitutive STING signalling was detected in both of these diseases resulting in dysregulated IFN-I signalling via interferon receptors and the adaptors JAK and Tyk. This leads to the accumulation of activated STAT1/2 dimers in the nucleus, promoting transcription of interferon-stimulated genes. Both Liu and K\u00f6nig\u2019s groups demonstrated that treatment with the JAK1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib in patient biopsy samples suppresses STAT activation and restores the STING response to immune stimuli similar to healthy control cells [39, 105] (Figure 5).",

Marked amelioration of systemic inflammation and reduction of interferon-stimulated gene expression was consistently observed in all three patients and in the subsequently recruited additional four patients with STING gain-of-function mutations. However, suspension of JAK inhibition in one patient resulted in a dramatic inflammatory relapse, though rescued by re-introducing ruxolitinib, demonstrating that this approach may be unsustainable and requires continuous monitoring [105, 205, 206]. Nonetheless, it is arguable that the partial inhibition of JAK-STAT pathway has the advantage of preserving STING-dependent immune protection against infection in these patients, since no excessive infection incidents were observed during these clinical trials [205].

The effective anti-SLE biologics, belimumab, targets the BLyS protein of B lymphocytes, preventing B cell activation and expansion critical to the production of autoantibodies and downstream activation of T lymphocytes [208, 209] (Figure 5). A series of stage II and stage III clinical trials have shown effective B-cell inhibition and significant improvement of clinical symptoms in combination with traditional care therapy of SLE in the treatment group compared to placebo control, whilst drug tolerance and immunosuppression-induced infection susceptibility were not markedly increased [209\u2013211]. This suggests an effective drug efficacy and safety of belimumab over another B-cell depleting drug rituximab, which failed to ameliorate SLE symptoms in phase II and III trails [212]. Unlike JAK inhibitors and anti-IFN biologics, B-cell targeted therapies are much less effective in controling type I interferonopathy that consequently cause complex inflammatory responses in STING mutant patients. However, they are still commonly used to treat the SLE-related consequences of STING over-activation to stall symptom deterioration, while they have also been considered suitable adjuvant candidates for STING-targeted therapeutics.",

However, targeting intracellular proteins such as STING remains challenging as the plasma membrane is a highly hydrophobic and size-selective barrier that resists passive entry of chemicals [57]. In contrast to the de novo STING ligand 2\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP [48], other cyclic dinucleotides are produced exogenously by pathogens and introduced into the cytoplasm by active transport or particle fusion [47, 50, 214].

These particles induced cellular expression of type I interferon genes which were effectively blocked by the TBK1 inhibitor BX795, suggesting that the interferon response was specifically induced via the STING/TBK1 pathway. Furthermore, the YSK05-based particles also express high levels of the antigen-presenting molecule MHC class I and T cell co-stimulating molecules CD80 and CD86 that are a prerequisite of T lymphocyte activation; all of these characteristics suggest they offer potential as adjuvants in anti-tumour therapies. Preliminary tests carried out by Miyabe and colleagues showed that mice immunized with cyclic di-GMP containing YSK05-liposomes reject tumour implantation compared to matched controls [219]. Subsequently, Nakamura\u2019s group demonstrated that in vivo injection of these particles greatly enhances the expression of IFN-I and MHC class I molecules in tumourigenic mice, resulting in augmented NK cell activation and potent innate immune protection against lung melanoma metastasis [220]. Therefore, the YSK05 liposomes offer a potential vehicle to assist delivery of STING ligands and to develop STING-based adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy.",

This method employs polyethyleneimine / hyaluronic acid (LH) -based hydrogels to enclose dinucleotide drugs into micron size spheres, which are selectively taken up by phagocytic cells such as RAW 264.7 macrophages, L929 fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), but not by non-phagocytic fibroblasts. Thus, the micron-sized particles appear to target phagocytosis specifically to gain entry into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, Lee et al. showed that LH-cGAMP hydrogel can induce IFN-I spikes in RAW264.7 macrophages, which were more than twice the magnitude of that induced by lipofectamine-delivered cGAMP at the same dose [221]. Administration of ovalbumin-containing LH-cGAMP particles in mice activates both the type I interferon response and humoral production of IgG to protect against ovalbumin challenge. Taken together, Miyabe and Lee\u2019s work indicates that the modified liposome-based delivery systems can markedly enhance in vitro and in vivo delivery of cyclic dinucleotide to cytoplasmic STING, and this success will promote the development of novel cancer vaccination and immunotherapies dependent on STING signalling.",

            "text": "Cytoplasmic DNA has been implicated in many human pathologies, many associated with chronic inflammation. Research has revealed that the ER transmembrane protein STING is a crucial player in dsDNA pathogen -sensing pathways whose dysregulation contributes to the development of several diseases. By responding to DNA sensors and cyclic dinucleotides, STING induces IRF3- and NF-\u03baB \u2013dependent pathways to elicit proinflammatory responses against infection and cancer progression. STING also directly crosstalks with several other regulators to modulate critical biological processes including autophagy and cholesterol biosynthesis. It is evident that activating STING results in the type I interferon response to protect against infection and tumour formation, while dysregulated gain-of-function STING mutations lead to detrimental consequences of autoimmunity. Understanding the molecular signalling mechanisms of STING activation has provided new insights to advance therapeutic strategies in treating infection, cancer and autoimmune diseases. It has also prompted the development of intracellular delivery systems to administer STING agonists. Despite the fact that STING has only been studied for a decade, this adaptor protein will continue to attract attention in immunology research and clinical practice into the future.",

Gain-of-function mutations of V155 M, N154S and V147 L have been identified in human autoinflammatory disease called STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), and substitution of G160E is the major cause of another human autoimmune disease known as familiar chilblain lupus (FCL). The most predominant loss-of-function STING mutant named HAQ is considered to compromise host innate response against infection, yet no clinical evidence is available for further discussion.

Cytoplasmic DNA, released from DNA viruses or reverse transcribed from the RNA viral genome, can induce direct interaction between STING and DNA sensors (in red) such as DDX41, IFI16, and DAI.

Mitochondrial stress can result in the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which also induces DNA sensor activation (not shown) and STING-mediated signalling.

STING-mediated signalling can be negatively regulated via multiple mechanisms, including E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM30\u03b1- and TRIM21- mediated degradation of STING and its upstream DNA sensor DDX41, respectively. Certain phosphodiesterases (PDEs) also specifically hydrolyse bacterial cyclic dinucleotides to prevent them being sensed by STING. Akt kinase is also capable of inhibiting cGAS detection of cytoplasmic DNA. Activated cGAS produces 2\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP to release AMPK-mediated inhibition of ULK1, which in turn blocks IRF3 recruitment downstream of STING activation. 2\u2032-3\u2032 cGAMP produced by cGAS can also activate Beclin-1 which can sequester cGAS as well as induce degradation of dsDNA. In a negative feedback loop, the product of the IRF3-dependent antiviral response, microRNA-576-3P (miR-576-3P), can prevent further STING activation. Some viruses can encode proteases or protein inhibitors to interfere in STING signalling, while others may enhance the activity of inflammasome complexes NLRC3 and NLRX1 to block STING/ TBK1 interaction",

Unresolved accumulation of cytoplasmic DNA can potentially trigger chronic inflammatory responses which result in autoimmune diseases, including a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and b Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome (AGS). Both diseases are strongly associated with persistently enhanced type I interferon upregulation named type I interferonopathy and subsequent B and T lymphocyte activation that potentiates systemic tissue and organ damage. Though STING dysregulation has been suggested to play an essential role in the development of these diseases, current treatment of SLE and AGS still relies heavily on anti-inflammatory therapies and DNA resolving methods to ameliorate symptoms. Gain of function mutations of STING can cause two autoimmune diseases named c STING-associated vasculopathy with on-set in infancy (SAVI) and d familial chilblain lupus (FCL). Both diseases show similar manifestations to SLE and AGS and are much less responsive to STING ligands than other immune stimuli.

Recently designed YSK05-containing liposomes (4) could carry c-di-GMP across plasma membranes to induce DDX41-mediated STING activation as well as enhance the expression of MHC class I molecules and T cell co-stimulatory receptors (not demonstrated), and thus it is considered to be a potential adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy. In addition, the polyethyleneimine/ hyaluronic acid (LH) hydrogel-based vesicles use phagocytosis to deliver both STING ligands and antibody-stimulating agents such as ovalbumin (dark triangles) to cells (5), and enhance both STING-dependent innate immunity and MHC class II-activated adaptive immunity to suppress cancer growth.
