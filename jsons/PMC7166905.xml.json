Specimen collection from women will often require an in\u2010and\u2010out catheterization (B\u2010III).16Residents with long\u2010term indwelling urethral catheters and suspected urosepsis should have catheters changed prior to specimen collection and institution of antibiotic therapy (A\u2010II).17The minimum laboratory evaluation for suspected UTI should include urinalysis for determination of leukocyte esterase and nitrite level by use of a dipstick and a microscopic examination for WBCs (B\u2010II). If pyuria (>10 WBCs/high\u2010power field) or a positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite test is present on dipstick, only then should a urine culture (with antimicrobial susceptibility testing) be ordered (B\u2010III).18If urosepsis is suspected, urine and paired blood specimens should be obtained, if feasible, for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and a Gram stain of uncentrifuged urine should be requested (B\u2010III).\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality to detect osteomyelitis, but bone biopsy for histopathologic examination definitively confirms the diagnosis and is most useful in guiding antimicrobial therapy (A\u2010III).25For suspected mucocutaneous fungal infection, a scraping can be performed for potassium hydroxide 10% preparation to verify the presence of yeast or dermatophytes (B\u2010III). If mucocutaneous candidiasis is refractory to empirical treatment, culture can be performed for the detection of drug\u2010resistant species (B\u2010III).26For suspected herpes simplex or herpes zoster, skin scrapings may be examined for the presence of giant cells (Tzanck preparation) and/or sent for culture, immunofluorescent viral antigen studies, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (A\u2010III).27Scabies should be considered in any nursing home resident with a generalized rash that is unexplained. Diagnosis should be attempted by light microscopy demonstration of mites, eggs, or mite feces on mineral oil preparations of several scrapings (B\u2010III).

Submit a single diarrheal stool specimen to the laboratory for a C. difficile toxin assay. If diarrhea persists and if the assay result is negative, submit 1 or 2 additional stool specimens for the toxin assay (A\u2010II).30In a patient with symptoms of colitis but no history of antibiotic use within the previous 30 days and/or a negative C. difficile evaluation result, one should submit a stool sample for culture for isolation of the most frequent invasive enteropathogens (i.e., Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella and Shigella species, and Escherichia coli O157:H7) (A\u2010II).31Local public health authorities should be consulted if rates of gastroenteritis or colitis exceed baseline thresholds in the facility (if these thresholds are known), if \u22652 cases occur at the same time in the same unit, or if a reportable pathogen is isolated (B\u2010III).32Intra\u2010abdominal infections and abscesses can occur in LTCF residents as a consequence of GI pathology.

Clinician access for timely direct patient assessment of fever or other symptoms remains a vexing problem for many LTCFs. Consequently, fever is a common antecedent to the decision to transfer patients to a higher level of care. Although direct care staff often make the initial clinical observations, calls to clinicians are typically made by supervising staff (an LPN or RN), because they are the ones licensed to take physician orders over the telephone. Multiple issues can impede effective communication about a possible infection in a facility or with a clinician, such as failure to communicate a change in condition at a shift change, difficulty contacting an on\u2010call physician after hours, or a difficult relationship between a nurse and a physician.\n56\n Skills of direct care staff in recognizing symptoms of infection and communicating them to a supervisor may be influenced by experience, education, and language skills (for nonnative speakers). The LPN or RN should independently assess the resident to be certain that key information on the resident's condition is available when the nurse calls the clinician. Clinicians practicing in the LTCF need to participate in setting and reinforcing standards for consistent collection and reporting of clinical information, so that adequate detail is communicated when there are overt or subtle signs suggesting an infection or other acute change in condition. Acute or subacute changes in functional status, such as new urinary incontinence, falls, decreased oral intake, or delirium, may be the initial and/or only clinical manifestation of infection in elderly persons.\n5\n\n",
