The high case fatality rate and global spread led to an urgent response by an international network co-ordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations, which resulted in the rapid identification of the aetiological agent Fouchier et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003; Kuiken et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003) . The outbreak was caused by a newly emerged and previously unrecognised coronavirus, now known as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV has been determined and the virus is classified within the order Nidovirales , family Coronaviridae , genus Coronavirus (Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003 ) . From December 16, 2003 to January 8, 2004 , four SARS cases were detected in the city of Guanghzou, the capital city of Guangdong province of China (Liang et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2006) . None of these cases was fatal or resulted in documented secondary transmission, suggesting the possibility that these sporadic outbreaks were caused by less virulent strains of SARS-CoV.",

Before the discovery of SARS-CoV, two human coronaviruses (229E and OC43) were known to cause upper respiratory tract infections that varied in frequency and severity in different disease outbreaks, but were usually mild and self-limited (Holmes and Lai 2001) . Since the discovery of SARS-CoV, two new coronaviruses, NL63 (van der Hoek et al. 2004 ) and HKU1 , have been isolated from human patients with nonfatal infections. To date, SARS-CoV is the only known coronavirus capable of causing lethal infection in humans. Recently, two groups independently demonstrated that bats in the genus Rhinolophus are natural reservoirs of SARS-like viruses , providing strong evidence that SARS-CoV is indeed a new zoonotic virus with a wildlife origin.",

Between November 2002 and February 2003, the first cases or clusters of SARS appeared in several independent geographic locations in the Pearl River Delta region in southern Guangdong, and suggested multiple introductions of a virus or similar viruses from a common source. Several of the early cases were reportedly associated with occupations that involved contact with wildlife, including handling, killing and selling wild animals as well as preparing and serving wildlife animal meat in restaurants (Xu et al. 2004 ). Moreover, a study of early SARS cases (i.e. those with disease onset prior to January 2003) compared to those identified later in the outbreak found that 39% of early-onset cases were food handlers, whereas only 2%-10% of cases between February and April 2003 were associated with this occupation. Also, early-onset cases were more likely to live within walking distance of animal markets than lateonset cases (Xu et al. 2004) .",

In one study by Xu et al. (2004) , a total of 1,454 clinically confirmed human cases were analysed covering the period from November 2002 to April 30, 2003. Several observations supported the hypothesis of a wild animal origin for SARS. It was observed that early cases of SARS occurred independently in at least five different well-separated municipalities in Guangdong Province. The study also found that early patients were more likely than later patients to report living near a produce market, but not near a farm, and nine of 23 (or 39%) early patients were food handlers with probable animal contact.",

Yu et al. (2003) analysed serum samples taken on May 4, 2003 from animal traders in three different live animal markets in Guangzhou. Out of 508 animal traders surveyed, 13% had antibodies to SARS-CoV; 72% of traders of masked palm civets ( Paguma larvata ) were seropositive. Interestingly, none of the animal traders had SARS or atypical pneumonia diagnosed during the SARS outbreak in Guangdong, suggesting asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV or a closely related SARS-like coronavirus. The presence of subclinical infections was corroborated in a separate study conducted by a Hong Kong group (Zheng et al. 2004) , who found that 17 of 938 (or 1.7%) adults recruited in 2001 had antibodies to SARS-CoV detected by immunofluorescence and virus neutralisation assays. These findings suggest that a small proportion of healthy individuals in Hong Kong had been exposed to SARS-CoV-related viruses at least 2 years before the SARS outbreak reached Hong Kong in mid-February 2003.",

The animals remained in the market for a variable period of time and each stall holder had only a few animals of a given species. Animals from different stalls within the market were sampled. Nasal and faecal swabs were collected for PCR and virus isolation and, where possible, blood samples were taken for serology. Among the six masked palm civets sampled, three were PCR-positive, and a SARS-CoV-like virus was isolated from four nasal swabs and one faecal swab . In addition, a very closely related virus was isolated from the faecal swab of the only raccoon dog ( Nyctereutes procyonoides ) sampled in the study. Two Chinese ferret badgers ( Melogale moschata ) were sampled, and although neither was PCR-positive, one displayed a neutralising antibody titre of 1:160 against SARS-CoV.",

Retrospective serologic studies indicated that there were no antibodies to SARS-CoV in the human population prior to the SARS outbreak, suggesting that SARS-CoV was not an existing human coronavirus . Epidemiologic studies, as discussed above, revealed that animal handlers and people working in the food industry had a higher representation than other groups among early SARS patients. Molecular epidemiologic studies confirmed that the earliest genotypes of human SARS-CoV from the 2002-2003 outbreaks were most closely related to those of animal SARS-CoV isolates ; The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 2004). During the sporadic outbreaks of 2003-2004, a total of four patients were independently infected with the SARS-CoV (Liang et al. 2004 ). There was no direct link between any of the four cases and none of the patients had direct or indirect contact history with previously documented SARS cases; all of them had a history of contact with animals. Furthermore, genome sequences of SARS-CoVs from human patients in 2003-2004 were almost identical to those isolated from civets in the market at the same time period, but more divergent from the human SARS-CoVs obtained during the 2002-2003 outbreaks. Taken together, these results demonstrated that animal-to-human transmission was responsible for the introduction of SARS-CoV into the human population.",

Considering that these animals were sampled at the same time in the same market, but originated from different regions of southern China, it is most likely that some, if not all, of them got infected in the market through animal-to-animal transmission. In the same study, it was shown that the raccoon dog isolate (SZ13) had an S-gene sequence which was identical to that of one of the civet isolates (SZ16) but differed from the other two civet isolates (SZ1 and SZ3) which displayed S-gene sequence variation.

However, for countries with a moderate to large number of cases, superspreading events (SSEs) played a pivotal role in large-scale transmission of the virus. In such circumstances, a few infected individuals caused a much higher number of secondary infections. In addition to the SSE in the Hong Kong hotel, other SSEs occurred in a hospital setting in Hong Kong, an air flight from Hong Kong to Beijing and in healthcare settings in Beijing, Singapore and Toronto (Anderson et al. 2004 ). In the SSE in a Beijing hospital, one patient infected 33 out of 74 persons that had close contact with the patient.

The genome sequence of the pig isolate (designated TJF) revealed it to be closely related to the human isolate BJ01obtained from a patient in Beijing, 120 km from Tianjin, but only distantly related to SARS-CoVs isolated from animals. More importantly, the TJF genome contained the 29-nt deletion, the genetic feature characterising SARS-CoV which circulated among human patients during the later phases of the 2002-2003 outbreaks, but never observed in any of the animal SARS-CoV isolates.

Due to the sudden emergence of SARS, it was extremely difficult to obtain reliable epidemiologic data to pinpoint the source of the outbreak. The vast number of live animals being traded in animal markets in southern China further complicated the investigation process. Experimental animal infection studies therefore became an important component of the SARS-CoV investigation.

Following the detection of SARS-CoV in market palm civets at the end of 2003, palm civets were culled in Guangdong Province in an attempt to prevent the potential reemergence of SARS. This provided a unique opportunity for Kan et al. (2005) to sample a relatively large number of animals for molecular epidemiological studies. A total of 91 palm civets and 15 raccoon dogs were sampled in the Xinyuan animal market in Guangzhou in January 2004. The animals were selected from 18 vendors with booths located in four blocks dedicated to the sale of civets and raccoon dogs. PCR analysis indicated that all of the animals sampled were positive and that most animals yielded positive rectal and throat swabs. In the same study, a total of 1,107 palm civets were sampled from 25 farms in 12 provinces from January to September 2004, but none of them was positive when analysed by the same PCR tests. These farms were selected on the basis that they used to sell animals to one of the booths at the Xingyuan animal market or that they claimed to have previously provided more than 80% of their animals to markets in Guangdong province.",

The most variable regions were located in the 5\u2032 end of the S gene, which codes for the surface spike protein involved in receptor binding, and in the ORF10-coding region immediately upstream from the N gene, which contains the coding region for putative nonstructural proteins of unknown function (Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003) and is known to be prone to mutation and deletions of various sizes Song et al. 2005 ; The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 2004). When these regions were excluded from the comparison, the sequence identity increased to 94% between SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs . It was interesting to note that the ORF10-coding region of bat SL-CoVs contained the 29-nt sequence present in civet SARS-CoV isolates and human SARS-CoV isolates from the early phase of the outbreak, but absent from human isolates obtained in the later phases of the outbreak (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 2004).

Furthermore, sequence analysis also indicated that human and civet SARS-CoV nestle phylogenetically within the spectrum of SL-CoVs, suggesting that the viruses responsible for the SARS outbreaks were members of this diverse coronavirus group, tentatively named the group 2b coronaviruses or G2b-CoVs (Wang et al. 2006) . This notion was strengthened by the comparison of genetic relatedness among the different bat viruses detected in Hong Kong and mainland China.

Horseshoe bats are cave-dwelling animals which feed mainly on moths and beetles and may have the opportunity to come into close proximity with other animals which live in or explore caves. It is interesting to note that in the study by , serological findings indicated that Rousettus leschenauti , a much larger cavedwelling fruit bat, may also be infected by a closely related G2b-CoV, although at much lower frequency. Contact between bats and other animal species may also arise because bats are used as a source of medicinal components and live bats are among a large number of different animal species that are traded in animal markets. From the studies by and Lau et al. (2005) , we know that the main route of excretion of G2b-CoV from naturally infected bats is via faecal shedding. The opportunity of virus transmission between H R and H S is therefore further enhanced since direct contact of bats and other animals may not be absolutely required for the virus to pass to a H S .

SARS-CoV reactive antibody was found in 79% of civets in January 2004 in one study and 100% of civets tested in another study contained SARS-CoV genomic RNA. Civet trading was banned in May 2003 after the first SARS outbreaks, but was resumed in August 2003. Considering that there was no evidence of widespread infection of SARS-CoV among civet populations on farms and in the wild (Tu et al. 2004; Kan et al. 2005) , it can be concluded that re-appearance of the virus in the civet population in markets in late 2003 to early 2004 was a result of separate spillover event(s) which occurred after the resumption of civet trading in August 2003. This would suggest sustainable intra-H S transmission among civets after spillover events. Similarly, intra-H S transmission among different human populations was documented in many different cities, especially in Guanghzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore and Toronto (Anderson et al. 2004) . It is conceivable that such intra-H S transmission would have been sustained for a much longer period if draconian quarantine measures had not been implemented.",

It was discovered that genotypes characteristic of each phase could be identified, and that the earliest genotypes were the most similar to those of SARS-CoVs isolated from animals. Moreover, it was shown that while the neutral mutation rate of the viral genome was constant during the different phases of the outbreak, the amino acid substitution rate of the coding region slowed during the course of the outbreak, indicating rapid adaptation to the human host. As expected, the spike proteincoding gene showed the strongest initial responses to host selection pressures.",

This suggested a rapid process of virus evolution in civets, much like the adaptation process revealed for human SARS-CoV isolates in the first study (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 2004). These results also indicated that civets were not likely to be an H R , and highlighted their potential role as an H S involved in transmitting the virus from bats to humans. The authors concluded that major genetic variations in critical genes, particularly the S gene, are essential for the progression from animal-to-human transmission to sustained human-to-human transmission, which eventually led to the first SARS outbreaks in 2002-2003.",

(2005) who analysed a total of 17 animal-derived sequences isolated in January 2004 and compared them to those from animals and humans isolated in 2003. Their study revealed that viruses in palm civets in the live animal markets had undergone a process of evolution that generated viruses with the potential to infect humans. Within the 17 animal-derived sequences, there were three which did not contain any of the novel signature variation residues (SNV) that characterised previously isolated pathogenic viruses. The authors postulated that such viruses were the evolutionary starting point of a process which introduced seven SNVs and caused the substitution of six amino acid residues in the spike protein. The resulting virus jumped to humans and was the cause of the low pathogenic infection of humans in 2003-2004. A further 14 SNVs caused 11 amino acid residue changes and resulted in the high-pathogenicity viruses which were responsible for human infection during early phase of the 2002-2003 outbreaks. Finally, six SNVs with four amino acid changes produced the group of viruses that were responsible for the global epidemic in the middle to late phases of the SARS outbreaks.",

The recent identification of horseshoe bats as the natural reservoir of this new group of G2b-CoVs will undoubtedly play an important role in facilitating our understanding of SARS emergence and in the prevention of future outbreaks. Bats have been identified or implicated as the natural reservoir host for an increasing number of new and often deadly zoonotic viruses. In addition to the emergence of G2b-CoVs from insectivorous Rhinolophus species, Hendra virus, Nipah virus and, most recently, Ebola virus have been shown to have fruit bat reservoir hosts (Chua et al. 2002; Halpin et al. 2000; Leroy et al. 2005 ; see the chapters by Field et al., and Gonzalez et al., this volume) . Bats typically respond asymptomatically to virus infection and display a capacity to permit persistent virus infections (Sulkin and Allen 1974) . Their wide distribution and abundant status (one mammalian species in five is a bat) makes them prime candidates for reservoirs of viruses which may, like G2b-CoVs, jump the species barrier and infect humans and other animals. Information on the ecology of bats and the nature of their response to virus infection may not only be scientifically interesting, but may also provide fundamental information on how best to cope with further outbreaks of disease caused by bat-borne viruses (Calisher et al. 2006) .",
