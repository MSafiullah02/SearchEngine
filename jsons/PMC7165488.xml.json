Ultraviolet (UV) treatment of liquid plasma has been proposed to introduce an additional redundant inactivation step in the manufacturing process of SDP to further enhance biosafety of the final spray\u2010dried product (Polo et al. 2015; Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2017).",

During the spray\u2010drying process, thermal inactivation, high pressure and rapid dehydration are the phenomena involved in microbial inactivation. Although the most important site of damage caused by dehydration is the cytoplasmic membrane (Crowe et al. 1987; Lievense & van 't Riet 1994; Perdana et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2017), dehydration also produces damage to DNA/RNA and protein (Lievense 1992).

However, it is prudent to evaluate additional biosafety features that may further enhance the robustness of the SDP production process. Exposure to UV\u2010C is extensively used for the disinfection of liquid media and surfaces due to its germicidal activity (Guerrero\u2010Beltran 2004; Lin et al. 2012). Previous research has demonstrated that UV\u2010C treatment of liquid plasma was effective to inactivate Porcine parvovirus (Polo et al. 2015) and Salmonella spp. (Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2017) inoculated in liquid plasma. During the spray\u2010drying process, temperature and dehydration are the mechanisms that contribute to microbial mortality (Perdana et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2017), whereas, UV\u2010C treatment causes damage to nucleic acids (Jagger 1967) and protein\u2010DNA cross links (Smith 1962).",

For both strains of E. coli, a rapid decrease in bacterial count was observed between 0 and 3000 J l\u22121 of UV\u2010C, with the appearance of a residual population (Nres) afterwards. These results agree with other UV\u2010C inactivation studies performed with E. coli (Hijnen 2006). The reduction of the inactivation rate at high UV fluencies (tailing) could be caused by micro\u2010organism aggregation, appearance of a resistant subpopulation, hydraulic design (Hijnen 2006), matrix effect or particle size effect (Winward 2008). Porcine plasma is a dense, coloured, liquid matrix with 8\u201310% solids, and contains a complex blend of different proteins with some of the proteins having binding properties (Burnouf 2007). Therefore, the matrix and particle size effects of porcine plasma may have had a special impact on the tailing effects of UV\u2010C treatment in the present study.",

Plasma pooling is also a recognized safety step in the production of certain human plasma products (Solheim et al. 2000, 2006, 2008), since there is successful neutralization of antigens in the presence of NA.

Spray\u2010dried plasma has a water activity of <0\u00b76 and is packaged and stored in mild temperatures. The storage conditions for SDP held at room temperature (c. 20\u00b0C) for 14 days has been demonstrated effective to inactivate Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and other coronaviruses when these viruses were experimentally inoculated on spray\u2010dried plasma (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s 2014; Sampedro et al. 2015). However, it is unknown if these storage conditions affect E. coli or other bacteria survival in spray\u2010dried plasma. In the present study, the SDP storage temperature effect (20\u00b0C for 14 days) on E. coli survival was not tested because both E. coli strains did not survive the spray\u2010drying process.

The plasma flowed through a steel tube containing a vortex (internal grooved spiral tube that generated a turbulent flow) between the spiral tube and the quartz sleeve. The tangential inlet of the reactor created high velocity and turbulence in the inlet chamber improving liquid contact with the UV\u2010C light. The liquid was pumped from the inlet chamber into the reactor at a constant flow rate of 4000 l h\u22121 to achieve a Reynolds value greater than 2800 which is indicative of a turbulent flow (Simmons et al. 2012).
