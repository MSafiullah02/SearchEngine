            "text": "The virus particles themselves are tiny, with the sizes of most virions at the limit of the resolution of even the best light microscopes. Most viruses are on the order of 50\u2013200 nm in diameter, though the smallest parvoviruses can measure less than 30 nm, while poxviruses or rhabdovirus particles like the vesicular stomatitis virus can be 0.3\u2010 to 0.4\u2010\u03bcm long. Filoviruses such as Ebola or Marburg virus or filamentous forms of the influenza virus have diameters of about 80\u2013100 nm, but can reach lengths of several \u03bcm. Viruses can be localized by fluorescence methods using specific antibodies directed against viral proteins, or viral components coupled to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or its derivatives. This allows virus\u2010infected cells to be analyzed by FACS methods or by immunofluorescence staining to reveal the distribution of major viral components, but these techniques cannot reveal much about structure. Viruses can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy as small spots, though the resolution is rarely sufficient to determine whether fluorescent spots represent virions, aggregates of viral proteins, or subviral particles. When carefully controlled, fluorescence methods can sometimes allow virus particles to be counted (Pizzato et al., 1999), while more recent multicolor fluorescence coincidence detection methods allow quantitative measurements of the antigenic composition of individual virions (Li et al., 2004). However, a detailed analysis virus structures requires higher resolution methods such as electron microscopy (EM). At the simplest level, negative staining of virus preparations can reveal some features of virus structure, size, and heterogeneity, and this can be of diagnostic value (Curry et al., 2006). More detail is revealed when virus preparations are rapidly frozen and the vitrified specimens examined by cryo\u2010EM. When combined with data from X\u2010ray diffraction studies, or with electron tomography or single\u2010particle analysis of isolated virions, highly detailed virus structures can be derived at near atomic resolution (Briggs 2006, Grunewald 2003).",

            "text": "As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses are dependent on living host cells for their replication. The viruses must first identify and adhere to a suitable host cell, which occurs through interactions of viral surface components or envelope glycoproteins with specific cellular receptors. The viral DNA or RNA genome must then access the relevant replication machineries of the host cells (Marsh and Helenius, 2006). Enveloped viruses have to fuse with a cellular membrane, allowing a naked virus core to be released into the cytoplasm. Further uncoating reactions and/or transport of the core to the cell's nucleus may also be required. Even the complex poxviruses, which carry their own machineries enabling them to carry out transcription and replication in the cytoplasm, need to access the appropriate location inside the cell, for example, in the vicinity of the endoplasmic reticulum (Schramm and Krijnse Locker, 2005). Once access to the replicative machineries has been established, the viral genetic material induces the host cell to synthesize the components required for the production of new virus particles, as well as virus\u2010specific enzymes or regulatory proteins that may reprogram the cells' activities. New virus particles are assembled, and, for enveloped viruses, acquire a lipid membrane by budding through a cellular membrane. Many cellular organelles have been shown to be involved in viral replication and assembly, including the plasma membrane, components of the biosynthetic pathway [endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus or the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN)], and endosomes. These compartments are exploited in different ways and to varying extents by different viruses. Some viruses subvert the host cells' normal functions, perhaps generating new virus\u2010induced structures or modifying normal cellular organelles to produce extensive \u201cvirus factories.\u201d These processes are most effectively studied with the electron microscope. The characteristic morphologies allow the easy identification of mature and assembling virus particles in cells, and the effects on the cell's own structure can be detected alongside. The EM techniques are even more powerful when combined with immunolabeling protocols, in particular immunolabeling of cryosections.",

Standard fixation protocols employ aldehyde fixatives to immobilize proteins and osmication to stabilize membrane structures. We now use a mixture of 2% formaldehyde (from paraformaldehyde), which is small and penetrates easily into cells, and 1.5% glutaraldehyde, a more potent fixative that cross\u2010links cell components, in 0.1\u2010M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. To minimize disturbance to the cells, it is best to prepare a double\u2010strength fixative (i.e., 4% formaldehyde/3% glutaraldehyde) at the temperature of the cells and add this directly into the culture medium. High\u2010pressure freezing, followed by freeze\u2010substitution with aldehyde fixatives may give even better preservation (Murk 2003, Studer 2001). However, many viruses are pathogenic and must be inactivated by fixation before the infected cells can be handled safely outside safety hoods or containment laboratories.",

            "text": "The assembly of HCMV takes place at specific replication sites both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of infected cells, often leading to large increases in cell size (cytomegaly). Distinct stages in the replication of HCMV have been documented by EM, as illustrated in Fig. 1\n. The viral capsid proteins move into the nucleus, where they assemble into 100\u2010nm\u2010diameter icosahedral cores that are then filled with the viral DNA to produce nucleocapsids (Fig. 1A). The nucleocapsids are thought to leave the nucleus by budding through the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope, before fusing and de\u2010enveloping at the outer nuclear membrane, so that naked capsids are released into the cytoplasm. This idea is supported by EM analysis, where enveloped capsids can sometimes be observed in dilations of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1B). In the cytoplasm, the particles acquire a layer of tegument proteins, a process that often occurs at characteristic cytoplasmic virus factories (Fig. 1C), identified as accumulations of electron\u2010dense tegument proteins in the vicinity of the centrioles/microtubule organizing center. The virus factories also tend to contain various membrane vesicles and are often surrounded by enlarged mitochondria. The virus particles acquire their final envelope by budding into characteristic crescent\u2010shaped membrane vesicles (Fig. 1D), and simultaneously become enclosed in small membrane\u2010limited vacuoles. Fusion of these vacuoles with the plasma membrane leads to the release of HCMV virions into the extracellular space. The morphology of the fully assembled extracellular virus particle (150\u2010 to 200\u2010nm diameter) shows the viral envelope, coated with a layer of the viral glycoprotein complexes (Fig. 1E). Three types of particles can be distinguished on HCMV\u2010infected cells, including enveloped nucleocapsids, empty capsid particles that lack the DNA genome [giving rise to noninfectious enveloped particles (NIEPs)], and cytoplasmic aggregates of tegument proteins, which produce enveloped \u201cdense bodies\u201d (see Fig. 1F). On infected human fibroblasts, we have also occasionally observed HCMV particles within or budding into multivesicular late endosomes (Fig. 1G). Various HCMV glycoproteins, including several viral chemokine receptor\u2010like proteins are also located on endosomes and multivesicular bodies and may be incorporated into the viral membrane during the budding step (Fraile\u2010Ramos 2001, Fraile\u2010Ramos 2002).",

            "text": "Retroviruses, including the primate lentiviruses HIV and SIV, are single\u2010stranded RNA viruses with a much smaller genome and simpler structure than the herpesviruses. The two copies of the unspliced 9.8\u2010kB RNA genome contain three major genes, gag, pol, and env; these code for the structural proteins, viral enzymes (reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease), and the envelope glycoprotein (Env), respectively. There are also sequences for a small number of accessory proteins (Freed, 2004). Like other enveloped viruses, HIV and SIV acquire their membrane by budding through a cellular membrane (Fig. 2A\n). Hence all of the components that make up an infectious virus particle need to be brought together at this membrane budding site in a coordinated manner (Pelchen\u2010Matthews et al., 2004). Virus assembly is driven primarily by the Gag polyprotein that contains all of the structural proteins of the virus, namely the matrix protein (MA) that forms a protein shell immediately beneath the viral membrane, the capsid protein (CA) that condenses into the truncated cone\u2010shaped core that is characteristic of HIV and SIV particles (see Fig. 2A), and the nucleocapsid (NC) that stabilizes the viral RNA genome. Gag alone is able to bind membranes, to deform them into a bud and later a stalked \u201clollipop\u201d\u2010type structure, and the presence of Gag can be visualized as a thick, membrane\u2010associated, electron\u2010dense layer at the budding site (Fig. 2A). Eventually, a scission reaction releases the budding virion from the host cell, and, concomitant with or shortly after release, the viral protease cleaves the Gag polyprotein, allowing CA and NC to condense into the cone\u2010shaped viral core of mature virions. Indeed, cells transfected with the gag gene alone will produce virus\u2010like particles (VLPs) with morphological features identical to immature SIV buds (Fig. 2B), but in the absence of the protease these particles cannot mature.",

Detailed analysis revealed a number of differences between particles budding from Gag or Gag\u2010GFP\u2010transfected cells. VLPs produced by Gag\u2010transfected cells had a fairly homogeneous size distribution of 110\u2013125 nm and consisted of a membrane envelope with an internal electron\u2010dense protein layer and an electron\u2010lucent center (Fig. 2B). Characteristically, the protein layer ended with a sharp line of electron density next to the lumen, similar to the appearance of immature virions budding from SIV\u2010infected cells (cf. Fig. 2A, arrow). Particles from Gag\u2010GFP\u2010transfected cells showed a wider size distribution (110\u2013160 nm, with occasional even larger particles) and significant shape heterogeneity, including oval or elongated particles (Fig. 2C). The electron\u2010dense layer at the budding sites appeared thicker (31 \u00b1 7 nm as compared to 23 \u00b1 3 nm for Gag buds) and lacked the electron\u2010dense line next to the particle lumen. In addition, the protein coat often showed a banded pattern with a regular periodicity of about 50\u201360 nm, both under the plasma membrane and in the budding or budded particles (Fig. 2C and D). Such interruptions in the protein layer were never seen for Gag VLPs and are likely to result from steric interference to Gag packing by the GFP moiety, which represents approximately one\u2010third of the chimeric Gag\u2010GFP protein. Aberrant Gag\u2010GFP\u2010budding structures have also been observed for HIV (Larson 2005, Muller 2004), though budding particles of normal appearance were seen in cells coexpressing Gag\u2010GFP together with unmodified Gag. Such cells still release green fluorescent VLPs, allowing correlative light microscopy/EM analysis (Larson et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The distribution of virus buds can also be useful in defining the sites of virus assembly. For example, SIV and HIV assemble primarily at the plasma membrane of T cells, T\u2010cell lines, or a variety of model tissue culture cell lines. However, intracellular vacuoles filled with virus particles can also occasionally be observed, both on SIV\u2010infected T cells (Fig. 2E) and on COS cells expressing high levels of the SIV Gag protein (Fig. 2F). This is similar to the assembly of HIV in primary human monocyte\u2010derived macrophages, which accumulate large vacuoles packed with virus particles (Gendelman et al., 1988). But on these static EM images, it is unclear where these intracellular viruses have assembled: virions near the cell surface might have been formed at intracellular locations and secreted, while intracellular virions could have been taken up by the cell, for example, by endocytosis. The presence of budding profiles or immature virions (Fig. 2E) can give an indication that viruses are actually assembling at a particular site, but such images are comparatively rare. Although the oligomerizing Gag protein can easily be identified on plastic sections, the presence of other viral proteins, such as Env, in the viruses is more difficult to establish. A further limitation of TEM of Epon sections is that it can be hard to identify the nature of the intracellular virus\u2010containing structures, for example, whether they are part of the endosome/lysosome system, or whether they represent structures modified by the virus, such as swollen Golgi cisternae or enlarged TGN vesicles. These questions can in part be addressed by immunolabeling of infected cells with antibodies against various intracellular markers. At least in the case of HIV assembly in macrophages, immunolabeling methods have demonstrated that the intracellular virus\u2010containing vacuoles contain some markers for late endosomes and lysosomes (Pelchen\u2010Matthews 2003, Raposo 2002).",

Methods for high\u2010pressure freezing followed by freeze\u2010substitution with aldehyde fixatives and rehydration before processing for cryosectioning are also being developed and may give still better cell preservation (Koster and Klumperman, 2003). However, when working with infected cell preparations, the fixation step also provides a useful way to inactivate the viruses. We routinely use a fixative containing 4% formaldehyde (prepared from paraformaldehyde and added to the cells as a double strength, i.e., 8%, fixative as detailed above). As glutaraldehyde is a cross\u2010linking fixative, it can improve cell preservation and the sectioning properties of the embedded, frozen cells, even at low concentrations (\u22640.2%), but even these low amounts can destroy some antigenic epitopes. Fixed cells are rinsed in a glycine\u2010containing buffer before embedding in gelatin, and embedded cell pellets are dissected into blocks suitable for sectioning, infiltrated with 2.3\u2010M sucrose as a cryoprotectant and frozen onto specimen pins by plunging into liquid N2.

Protein A conjugates can also be used to stain cells expressing Fc receptors: as the protein A\u2010binding site on antibodies is located in the Fc region, PAG will only bind to those antibody molecules bound to their specific antigens (with their protein A\u2010binding site exposed) and not those that have been captured by Fc receptors, where this site is hidden.",

On the other hand, the larger 15\u2010nm\u2010gold particles are easier to see in the EM and this can be used to focus the investigator's attention to features of interest such as virus\u2010infected cells or virus assembly compartments within these cells; modern digital cameras can be calibrated to enhance the contrast so that accumulations of gold particles can be detected even at low magnification and used to \u201chome in\u201d on the labeled structures.

            "text": "Some of our own studies on the assembly of VLPs from the SIV Gag protein illustrate applications of immunolabeling of cryosections (Fig. 3\n). The VLP\u2010budding profiles in COS cells transfected with the Gag\u2010GFP chimera were labeled with antibodies directed against the SIV MA or CA proteins (Fig. 3A and B, respectively), or with an antiserum against GFP (Fig. 3C). These antibodies show finely distinct labeling patterns, demonstrating the resolution of the EM\u2010immunolabeling method: antibodies against MA label the buds immediately beneath the membrane, consistent with the location of MA at the periphery of the VLPs, while anti\u2010CA antibodies stain more centrally over the electron\u2010dense Gag layer that is polymerizing under the membrane. Both the anti\u2010MA and anti\u2010CA antibodies are mouse IgG1s requiring a rabbit anti\u2010mouse IgG\u2010bridging antibody (an extra incubation step between the primary antibody and PAG in the protocol above). This gives the possibility to amplify the signal, as several bridging antibody molecules may bind to the primary antibody, and results in a more clustered distribution of the gold particles. The rabbit anti\u2010GFP antibody interacts directly with PAG, and no bridging antibody was used (Fig. 3C). Labeling here is by single gold particles. This is particularly striking over an area of flat polymerizing Gag\u2010GFP, where the striations in the Gag\u2010GFP layer are decorated with evenly spaced gold particles, located just below the electron\u2010dense Gag layer. Since the length of an antibody molecule is \u223c9 nm, gold particles would be expected to be located within 10 nm of the antigen in labeling reactions with a single primary antibody. If a bridging antibody is used, this will reduce the space resolution. While the orientation of the primary and bridging antibodies relative to the section may vary, for quantitative analysis it is generally assumed that the antigen of interest is located within \u223c20 nm of the surface of the gold particle.",

Since VLPs and budding figures are observed both at the plasma membrane and in some intracellular vacuoles, immunolabeling with antibodies against cellular markers can be used to identify these intracellular structures. Here, the VLP\u2010containing vacuoles were labeled by antibodies against the late endosomal protein CD63 (Fig. 3D) or the lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) (Kobayashi et al., 1998), which accumulates on the internal membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 3E). The presence of these markers identifies the intracellular vacuoles as late endosomes. Some VLPs appear to be directly labeled with gold particles, suggesting that CD63 or LBPA can themselves be incorporated into the budding virion membrane. By contrast, VLPs budded at the cell surface are not stained by the anti\u2010LBPA antibody (Fig. 3F), indicating that there may be biochemical differences between VLPs budded at the cell surface or at the membrane of endosomes.",

            "text": "We have also examined the assembly of various SIV strains that differ only in their cell surface Env. As for other retroviruses, the SIV Env glycoprotein is composed of two subunits, the surface glycoprotein (SU, gp120), which is noncovalently attached to the transmembrane subunit (TM, gp41). TM contains a long cytoplasmic domain of around 150\u2013180 amino acids, depending on the virus strain. This long cytoplasmic domain is required for virus transmission in vivo, but when some SIV isolates, such as SIVmac239, are passaged in human tissue culture cell lines, they spontaneously truncate the cytoplasmic domain and express an Env protein with a shorter cytoplasmic tail of only around 20 amino acids. Truncation of the Env TM cytoplasmic domain can increase Env incorporation into virions (Johnston 1993, Zingler 1993). We have examined CEMx174 cells chronically infected with SIVmac239 or with a variant expressing an Env protein with a truncated TM protein (SIVmac239/251Tail). Ultrathin cryosections were stained with an antibody against the V3 loop on the SIV SU protein (Edinger et al., 2000). As shown in Fig. 3G and H, there was only sparse gold labeling of the budded SIVmac239 particles (Fig. 3G), while virions with the truncated Env TM protein were much more strongly labeled (Fig. 3H). Consistent with the exposure of Env at the surface of the particles, the virions were decorated with PAG on the outside of the virions. Indeed, the abundant Env glycoproteins on these particles was visualized as a fuzzy electron\u2010dense layer (Fig. 3H). Since gold particles appeared as discrete spots on the images, they could be counted to give an estimate of the Env densities on virions. This suggested that, while SIVmac239 viruses were labeled with only 1.2 gold particles per virion (Fig. 3G), the short tail variant (SIVmac239/251Tail) contained 8.7 gold particles per virion (Fig. 3H), suggesting that this SIV variant incorporates more than seven times as much Env as the wild\u2010type SIVmac239, in agreement with the analysis of purified SIV particles by HPLC or electron tomography studies, which reveal \u223c8\u2010 to 10\u2010fold higher incorporation of truncated Env proteins into SIV (Chertova 2002, Zhu 2003). However, immunolabeling of cryosections offers the possibility of analyzing the composition of individual virus particles, rather than bulk populations, and may be used to compare, for example, viruses budded at intracellular sites or at the cell surface.",

This is in broad agreement with the values previously determined for the labeling of the Semliki Forest virus spike protein complex in infected baby hamster kidney cells (Griffiths and Hoppeler, 1986), or for labeling of 5\u2032\u2010nucleotidase at the cell surface (Howell et al., 1987). The high labeling of virions here probably results from the use of a rabbit anti\u2010mouse bridging antibody in the staining reaction, which gives some amplification, and from the fact that the stained virus particles are located in the extracellular space rather than embedded in the cytoplasmic matrix. The penetration of gold probes into cryosections depends on the density of the organelles, allowing reagents to penetrate well into some structures, while access to dense structures such as secretory granules may be severely restricted (Slot et al., 1989; Chapter 21 by Ladinsky and Howell, this volume). Labeling efficiencies vary for different antibody/antigen combinations, and depend on the size of the gold probes (higher labeling efficiencies are obtained with smaller gold probes), while steric effects may reduce the access of antibodies or gold probes at sites of high antigen density. While labeling efficiencies of around 10% or less can be acceptable for the study of viruses or virus\u2010infected cells, where viral proteins are expressed in abundance, inefficient detection can be a problem in the study of cellular antigens that may be present at much lower copy number.",

This is conveniently done with semithin (0.5 \u03bcm) cryosections that are cut with glass knives at \u221280\u00b0C, picked up on a droplet of 2.3\u2010M sucrose, and placed on glass slides. The slides should be marked by scoring small (5\u2010mm diameter) circles to indicate the area where the sections will be placed. A number of sections from different specimens can be placed side\u2010by\u2010side and screened together with the same antibody. Immunolabeling is performed on the slides by placing drops of solutions over the sections. Fixative is quenched by incubation in a solution of glycine and NH4Cl as above. For sections fixed in glutaraldehyde fixatives, a brief incubation in a freshly prepared solution of sodium borohydride is also required to reduce the autofluorescence of glutaraldehyde\u2010fixed tissue. Normally, there is no need to permeabilize the cells, as many organelles are cut open during the sectioning; however, if desired, buffers containing detergents such as Triton X\u2010100 or Saponin may be used. When these samples are stained, good images without \u201cout\u2010of\u2010focus\u201d fluorescence from adjacent layers in the cell can be obtained, even with a standard fluorescence microscope. Immunofluorescence thus allows a rapid assessment of the specimens: it can give an indication of the proportion of virus\u2010infected cells and, in situations where virus assembly occurs in a restricted location, of the number of cell profiles sectioned through the area of interest. The immunofluorescence patterns will give a first indication of the location of structures of interest, antibody reactivities can be conveniently assessed and antibodies titered, while double\u2010staining studies can give a first indication of the compartments involved.",

Double staining with PAG reagents requires sequential incubations, but it does sometimes permit double staining even with primary antibodies from the same species. These double\u2010staining protocols rely on the fact that the protein A\u2010binding site on antibodies is easily inactivated by a brief incubation in glutaraldehyde (5\u201310 min in 1\u20132% glutaraldehyde; we have found that a similar incubation in formaldehyde fixatives is not sufficient to block later cross\u2010reactions). With this in mind, a number of double\u2010 or even triple\u2010staining protocols can be devised (Table I\n). Antibodies that are able to bind protein A directly allow the simplest staining sequences, but protocols for labeling two mouse antibodies, even if one requires a bridging antibody, can also be developed. For example, labeling with a mouse IgG1, a rabbit anti\u2010mouse bridging antibody and a small PAG particle can be followed by glutaraldehyde fixation, quenching and then a blocking incubation with an isotype\u2010matched (again IgG1) irrelevant antibody to saturate any remaining sites on the bridging antibody that have affinity for mouse antibodies. Following another fixation step to inactivate PAG\u2010binding sites on the blocking antibody, the sections can be labeled with a mouse IgG2a or IgG2b followed by direct staining with a larger PAG particle. It is still not possible to double stain with two antibodies from the same species if they both require a bridging antibody (e.g., two weakly binding mouse IgG1s).",

Since all colloidal gold preparations contain some spread of particle sizes, combinations of 5\u2010 and 15\u2010nm gold particles give the most unambiguous distinction between the labels. Commercial preparations of 10\u2010 and 15\u2010nm gold both contain a small proportion of 12\u2010nm particles, so it may be difficult to identify the antibody associated with some individual particles. Given the ease with which large gold particles can be located at the EM, the biggest gold particles should be used to label structures of particular interest, for example, virus particles or a marker for a rare compartment. Due to steric interference and masking of sites, the efficiency of immunolabeling is reduced for the second or later antibody incubations, and hence the most critical staining reactions should be done first. For steric reasons, there is also less cross\u2010reaction if the smallest gold particles are used before larger conjugates in the staining sequence. Further restrictions arise if one antibody is sensitive to the glutaraldehyde fixation step: such an antibody then has to be used as the first primary antibody. To allow interpretations of the labeling patterns, antigen distributions should be carefully documented in single\u2010staining experiments, and all staining experiments need to be carefully controlled, for example, by using the \u201cwrong\u201d first antibodies or omitting reagents. The most informative controls are provided by cell lines lacking an antigen of interest, for example, after depletion by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or, when studying virus assembly, by uninfected cells, by pre\u2010absorbing antibodies with their antigen, and by omitting the second primary antibody.",

Some vacuoles are filled with viruses, while others contain scattered virus particles in irregular or interconnected structures. These structures can be stained with antibodies against markers for late endosomes (Pelchen\u2010Matthews et al., 2003) or for the major histocompatibility class II complex (Raposo et al., 2002), suggesting that they may be related to late endosomes or equivalent to the MIIC, the compartment where major histocompatibility class II molecules are loaded with peptides. Often only a fraction of the macrophages in a culture are infected with virus, which may be found in a restricted location in the cell, so screening samples by immunofluorescence (see Fig. 4 and above) is essential. Here, the preliminary immunofluorescence studies suggested that the virus vacuoles contain the tetraspanin CD9. This was further investigated in EM double\u2010labeling experiments. CD9 is located primarily at the plasma membrane, with rare staining also of intracellular vacuoles (cf. Fig. 4B), hence we wanted to mark the location of CD9 with large gold particles (PAG 15 nm). However, the CD9 antibody was extremely sensitive to glutaraldehyde fixation, with even a 5\u2010min incubation in 1% glutaraldehyde eliminating most of the signal. Thus, we used a protocol where staining with anti\u2010CD9/rabbit anti\u2010mouse bridging antibody/15\u2010nm PAG was followed by a rabbit anti\u2010HIV MA antiserum and 5\u2010nm PAG. Virus\u2010containing vacuoles were strongly labeled for CD9, which was frequently located over the virus particles in the lumen of the vacuole or over small vesicles resembling the intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies or \u201cexosomes\u201d (Fig. 5A\n). The identity of the virus particles was confirmed by their staining with 5\u2010nm PAG.",

Here sections from HIV\u20101BaL\u2010infected macrophages were stained sequentially with three antibodies that are all able to bind PAG directly. Virus particles are identified with a mouse monoclonal antibody against HIV\u20101 MA and 5\u2010nm PAG, the 10\u2010nm PAG marks the late endosome protein CD63, while a rabbit antiserum and 15\u2010nm PAG were used to detect the lysosomal marker, LAMP\u20101. Virus particles are clearly decorated with the 5\u2010nm gold particles, and often also labeled with the 10\u2010nm PAG identifying CD63. Indeed, biochemical studies have shown that CD63 is incorporated into the envelope of infectious HIV virions produced by macrophages (Nguyen 2003, Pelchen\u2010Matthews 2003). This is important because for many viruses, including HIV, only a fraction of the visible particles are infectious, and EM techniques alone cannot distinguish infectious from morphologically normal noninfectious virus particles. Cryosection immunolabeling allows the analysis of virus components, for example, the content of Envs that are essential for infectivity. Nonetheless, it is important to study statistically relevant numbers of virus particles, and the data are best analyzed in conjunction with complementary virological and biochemical studies. Finally in Fig. 5C, the 15\u2010nm gold particles identifying LAMP\u20101 are only rarely seen in the virus vacuole, but nearby an electron\u2010dense vacuole, probably a lysosome, is clearly labeled on its limiting membrane. These studies support the idea that the compartment where HIV assembles in macrophages is related to late endosomes but is distinct from lysosomes (Pelchen\u2010Matthews 2003, Raposo 2002).",

Hence lipid localization studies can benefit from high\u2010pressure freezing to prepare samples (Mobius et al., 2002). Cryosections are cut from the frozen specimens and collected with pick\u2010up solutions supplemented with aldehyde fixatives and uranyl acetate to stabilize the membranes.

When gold particle distributions on a set of photographs are compared with the distribution of random points (e.g., intersections on an overlaid lattice), relative labeling indexes can be calculated and used to identify significantly labeled compartments (Mayhew 2002, Mayhew 2004), and different experimental samples can be compared under various conditions.",

Nonspecific labeling needs to be clearly defined, for example on preparations lacking the relevant antigen, and quantified. Variations in the labeling efficiencies for different antibody antigen combinations or gold particle sizes must be accounted for. In particular, variations in the ability of different sized gold particles to penetrate cryosections (Slot et al., 1989), which may depend on the density of the structure to be analyzed, can give rise to different labeling efficiencies over different structures. For example, an antigen at the cell surface may be more accessible, and hence more strongly labeled, than the same molecule within an intracellular organelle, leading to large variations in labeling efficiencies (Griffiths and Hoppeler, 1986); hence, in some situations, labeling densities can only be used to compare variations in antigen concentration in similar organelles, and EM studies should be supported by, for example, quantitative biochemical analysis from cell fractionation.",

Tomography can reveal membrane connections and might be particularly revealing in studies of surface connections of budding viruses or of budding mutants. Tomography methods have also been used on thick cryosections (Koster and Klumperman, 2003; Chapter 21 by Ladinsky and Howell, this volume), revealing more structural details. However, colloidal gold probes do not penetrate into thick cryosections. Ultrasmall gold reagents are available, which can penetrate much further into sections and can be visualized by silver enhancement. A range of ultrasmall gold reagents against various antibodies is already available. Some of these are linked to Fab fragments, while reagents based on even smaller antibody fragments such as camelid heavy\u2010chain variable domains (Spinelli et al., 2000) are being developed. A related technology is the development of gold nanoparticles with defined chemical structures and therefore more uniformity than gold colloids. These particles can be covalently linked to various binding reagents, including antibodies, Fab fragments, ligands, or haptens, and show good stability and a long shelf life. Like ultrasmall gold reagents, gold nanoparticles can penetrate more deeply into sections, and can be visualized by silver enhancement or using gold\u2010based autometallography reactions that may be compatible with biological materials.",

Already applications have been described for GFP\u2010labeled HIV (Larson et al., 2005) or HCMV (Sampaio et al., 2005). Cells growing on gridded coverslips can be transfected, infected, or microinjected with GFP chimeras, or engineered virus strains. After imaging in a fluorescent microscope, possibly with live\u2010cell recording of the fluorescent constructs, cells are fixed and embedded, and the same cells can be relocated in the EM and may be imaged, even by tomography. Similar techniques are being developed for preparing cryosections from monolayers of cells (Oorschot et al., 2002), and for relocating the fluorescent cells on immunolabeled cryosections (Koster and Klumperman, 2003). Correlative methods may also make use of reagents such as FluoroNanogold\u00ae (nanogold particles as above, that have been modified with a fluorescent probe, either fluorescein or one of the Alexa Fluor\u00ae dyes). Such reagents can be used to label cells, or even cryosections, for analysis both at the fluorescent light microscope level and subsequently, after silver or gold enhancement, at the EM level. Indeed, ultrathin cryosections may be stained with FluoroNanogold\u00ae and then silver\u2010enhanced and viewed at the EM, with significantly higher labeling efficiencies than can be obtained with colloidal gold probes (Takizawa and Robinson, 2003). Fluorescent quantum dots are also reported to be easily visible in the EM and may have similar applications (Giepmans et al., 2005).",
