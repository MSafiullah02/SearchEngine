It is not a \u201cscience\u201d by any usual definition\u2014that is, it is not yet a set of principles by which knowledge of sustainability may be systematically built. Rather, it consists of a plethora of ideas and perspectives, sometimes conflicting, by which one might hope to achieve a viable future for humankind. All approaches recognize, in one way or another, that \u201cour common future\u201d depends critically upon preserving the life-giving functions of the Earth\u2019s ecosystems, landscapes, and biosphere. To achieve this requires the deepening of our understanding of the linkages between the \u201cglobal system\u201d (the planetary base for human survival), the \u201csocial system\u201d (the political, economic, industrial, and other human-devised structures that provide the societal basis of human existence), and the \u201chuman system\u201d (the sum total of all factors impacting the health of humans) (Komiyama and Takeuchi 2006).",

            "text": "The wake-up call for sustainability was sparked several decades ago by the report to the Club of Rome on \u201cThe limits to growth.\u201d This study, although built upon very simplified assumptions, showed that unbridled conventional economic growth is unsustainable. Clearly, there are limits to growth of the type that results in the depletion of non-renewable resources, for, ultimately, there will be \u201covershoot and collapse\u201d of population and the economic base (Meadows et al. 1972). Technological optimists have rejected this thesis, claiming that, as the depletion of one resource is approached, economic incentives will result in new technologies such that the depleted resource is no longer essential for human development. This may be true to some degree; for example, the desalinization of sea water has augmented or substituted for the limited supplies of fresh water in some special cases, but this solution cannot be universally adopted, owing to practical and financial constraints. However, the technological optimists have neglected a more fundamental constraint, namely, requirements for ecological functions. As many global and sub-global models have subsequently shown, unabated conventional economic development has already resulted in the degradation of ecological systems on a large scale. The report of the World Commission on Environment and Development warned that human activities must be tempered if development is to be ecologically supportable (WCED 1987). They advocated a policy of \u201csustainable development,\u201d that is, \u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d (WCED, p. 8). The WCED affirms the notion of limits to growth, although not in absolute terms, but, rather, limits set by the state of technology, social organization, and the capacity of the biosphere to \u201cabsorb the effects of human activities\u201d (WCED, p. 8).",

Ecosystem health is the study of the circumstances that enable ecosystems to maintain their full functionality while providing sustainable livelihoods and conditions that favor cultural well-being and public health. It seeks to identify key indicators of health at the ecosystem scale, taking the perspective that humans are part of, and not apart from, the system. Thus, the indicators are not only ecological in nature, but also involve social dimensions, including public health, cultural practice, sustainable livelihoods, governance, etc. Its focus is not only on measuring the health state of ecosystems and landscapes, but also on the determinants of health\u2014that is, the relationship of human activity to transformations in ecosystem and landscapes. Its perspective differs significantly from prevailing economic and engineering approaches. The concept of \u201chealth\u201d or \u201cwell functioning\u201d of ecosystems is often ignored by the prevailing engineering and economic approaches to environmental management, in which efficiency and monetary value are the key measures of success. From the ecosystem health perspective, the maintenance of the health of ecosystems, so that they maintain their full potential to sustain life itself, is the primary focus. ",

In many countries of the world, great strides have taken place in the economic realm, and also, in improving life expectancies. However, such gains are not sustainable if, as is the case in many situations, ecosystem functions are, at the same time, being compromised. This basic fact has been recognized for many centuries, if not for millennia. In ancient Greece, the great philosopher Plato noted marked deterioration in waters which had sewage inflow. By the eighteenth century, the citizens of Paris and London, while well aware that urban development had many benefits in terms of material well-being, were also aware that industrial processes and inattention to the needs to assimilate urban waste had resulted in grave damage to their rivers\u2014which, as a source of drinking water, was, in fact, the life-line of the city. In recent times, the great American naturalist, Aldo Leopold, noticed a number of tell-tale signs of what he termed \u201cland sickness\u201d in his native Wisconsin farm and woodlands. Agricultural development had clearly resulted in compromising the viability of agro- and forest ecosystems. Leopold pointed to soil erosion, nutrient depletion, loss of native species, increases in invasive species, increase in plant and animal pathogens, etc. as the key indicators of \u201cland sickness\u201d (Leopold 1941). Leopold suggested that the key to the sustainability of human settlement and agricultural practice was to maintain the \u201chealth\u201d of the land (Leopold et al. 1999).",

At the time, we were unaware of the pioneering work of Leopold, who had come to similar conclusions decades earlier; namely, that the Earth\u2019s ecosystems were becoming highly compromised as a result of anthropogenic stress and that one could establish a set of key indicators that could be used to assess the health of ecosystems.

To do this, we drew from the common medical practice of the identification of \u201cvital signs\u201d by which to assess health, and sought an appropriate set of vital signs that might have relevance at the ecosystem level. We suggested that, among the potential vital signs of ecosystems, these were nutrient and energy flows, soil nutrients, biodiversity, and the capacity of ecosystems to rebound from natural perturbations such as floods, fire, etc. Establishing quantitative baselines for particular ecosystems for these and other vital signs would enable one to identify situations in which ecosystem functions and structure were out of \u201cnormal bounds\u201d and, thus, had become compromised.",

In reality, all functions of ecosystems are vital to maintaining life systems, but some are recognized as more obviously of direct benefit to humankind, such as the provisioning of food and water (Costanza et al. 1997). For example, forest ecosystems provide many services, including the filtration of water (clean water), wood, food supplies from the harvest of forest game, stabilizing land forms (thus, protecting against mud slides), and providing recreational opportunities (such as bird watching, etc.). When forest ecosystems are compromised, there are significant losses in such ecosystem services, including, generally, a decrease in water quality and quantity, loss of fish habitat (in lakes, rivers, coastal areas within the watershed), loss of stability of land forms (resulting in increased risk of mud slides during heavy rains), loss of subsistence (e.g., hunting of game found in mature forests), etc. In short, anthropogenic stress on ecosystems, evidenced by the appearance of EDS, results in the reduction of ecosystem services, and, thus, of human well-being. As humans are part of the ecosystem, the loss of ecosystem services may serve as a \u201cblanket indicator\u201d of the deterioration in ecosystem health (Rapport 1995).",

In this situation, the lakes have been subject to the cumulative impact of a number of sources of anthropogenic stress for nearly two centuries (since European settlement). These stresses include the over-harvesting of fish, nutrient loading, the introduction of contaminants, many of which are toxic to living organisms, the introduction of exotic species, physical restructuring of shorelines, wetland drainage (for agriculture or urban development), etc. As a consequence, signs of EDS begin to appear by the early 1950s. These included reductions in species diversity (particularly in fish communities in harbors and bays), shifts in species dominance to favor smaller life forms (e.g., in fish communities, the shift from dominance by large benthic fish to small pelagic fish), increases in the concentration of nutrients (particularly phosphorus), increases in invasive species (e.g., the sea lamprey, smelt, alewife), increased disease prevalence (manifest in physiological abnormalities in fish and wildlife), increase in water-borne pathogens, and increase in the circulation of toxic substances within the water column and the biota. Such changes sharply reduced a number of ecosystem services. For example, there was a marked loss of most commercial fisheries (as a result of over-harvesting and other stresses), a loss of biodiversity, particularly within the near-shore fish community, a loss in the availability of edible fish, owing to their high levels of substances toxic to humans, loss of recreational opportunity (e.g., beach closures owing to public health concerns about human pathogens, e.g., fecal coliform bacteria), etc. (Bertram et al 2003).",

These recovery patterns are normal for healthy ecosystems. However, if the health of the ecosystem has become compromised owing to anthropogenic stress, recovery from natural perturbations will, in many cases, be slower and less complete. This hypothesis was tested in desert grassland ecosystems using a stress gradient created by cattle grazing patterns. Assessing the density and composition of key perennial grasses before and after a prolonged drought showed that recovery (resilience) was considerably higher in the less stressed part of the gradient than in the heavily stressed areas (Whitford et al. 1999).",

However, as humans are integral to the composition of ecosystems, it is also necessary to approach the question of evaluating the health of ecosystems from social, cultural, human health, and governance perspectives. Using the concept of resilience, for example, one might examine livelihoods in particular regions and how well they are able to buffer changes in economic conditions within a particular ecosystem or landscape. Similarly, one might look at the resilience of cultural traditions, perhaps in terms of the effectiveness of transmission of traditional knowledge from one generation to the next (Maffi 2001). The human health dimension of ecosystem health could be examined in terms of the capacity of people to cope with endemic disease risks, such as dengue fever and malaria in tropical countries, and in terms of nutritional status (McMichael 1993, 1997). Governance issues are also critical to the health of ecosystems (Ullsten 2003). Moving towards sustainability requires that communities which experience the impacts of human activities have a voice in determining what kinds of activities are acceptable. This is often not the case, particularly within the ever more \u201cglobal economy.\u201d In the mining and forestry sectors, as well as in water allocations, too often, decisions are taken by interest groups outside the community that ultimately bears the consequences in terms of environmental degradation.",

One way to overcome these obstacles is to seek ecosystem-based environmental accords, agreements, declarations, etc. that have the goal of the restoration of the health of regional ecosystems. For example, the Tulum Agreement brings together four countries of Mesoamerica for the common purpose of restoring the health of the Mesoamerican Coral Reef (Gawler et al. 2000).",

While goals such as the reduction of poverty, increased literacy, provision of adequate drinking water, etc. are laudable, they are not likely to be achievable in the absence of restoration of full functionality (i.e., health) to the Earth\u2019s ecosystems. Thus, to existing MDGs should be added an additional, and perhaps, primary goal\u2014namely, the restoration of the health of the biosphere and its ecosystems. If we fail to achieve this, it is most likely that we will continue to fall evermore short of the MDG targets.",

Since \u201csustainability science\u201d serves as a catalyst for encouraging new ideas that are essential to achieving a much-needed harmonization between human needs/aspirations and ecological constraints, ecosystem health should become one of its cornerstones.",
