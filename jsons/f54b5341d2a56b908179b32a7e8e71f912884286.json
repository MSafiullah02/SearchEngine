De novo diagnostic testing methods developed for emergent pandemics are subject to significant development delays and capacity limitations. There is a critical need for complementary surveillance approaches that can function at population-scale to inform public health decisions in real-time. Internet search patterns provide a number of important advantages relative to laboratory testing. We conducted a detailed global study of Internet search patterns related to COVID-19 symptoms in multiple languages across 32 countries on six continents. We found that Internet search patterns reveal a robust temporal pattern of disease progression for COVID-19: Initial symptoms of fever, dry cough, sore throat and chills are followed by shortness of breath an average of 5.22 days [95% CI 3.30-7.14] after symptom onset, matching the precise clinical course reported in the medical literature. Furthermore, we found that increases in COVID-19-symptom-related searches predict increases in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths 18.53 days [95% CI 15.98-21.08] and 22.16 days [95% CI 20.33-23.99] in advance, respectively. This is the first study to show that Internet search patterns can be used to reveal the detailed clinical course of a disease. These data can be used to track and predict the local spread of COVID-19 before widespread laboratory testing becomes available in each country, helping to guide the current public health response.",

During the early stages of a novel pandemic, laboratory tests specific to the pandemic do not yet exist and therefore must be developed de novo , leading to significant delays before test-based surveillance can begin. 2. Even once a test has been developed, scaling of manufacturing, distribution and test processing capacity takes a significant amount of time, resulting in limited testing capacity in many countries. 4 It is therefore difficult to achieve population-scale surveillance with laboratory testing in the crucial early stages of an emergent pandemic. 3. Even after tests are widely available, delays in test administration and processing make laboratory testing a lagging indicator relative to disease onset. 5 4. Laboratory testing often requires individuals to leave home and congregate at testing centers, increasing exposure both for those being tested and for the health workers administering the tests. 5.",

We also looked at other less common symptoms such as loss of smell and loss of taste, but the search data on those terms were too sparse for many countries. Since daily search data are inherently noisy, all search data were smoothed with a 5-day moving average. 22 and confirmed that robust data were available for these translated search terms on Google Trends. 19 We conducted temporal correlation studies to characterize the relationships between search data and reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. For each country and search term, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of search volumes for that search term and the time series of COVID-19 cases. We then shifted the search term data by a variable lag, and identified the lag that yielded the highest correlation. We computed the mean and standard deviation of these optimal lags for each search term across all countries. We then repeated these analyses substituting reported COVID-19 deaths for reported COVID-19 cases.",

Therefore, we examined a range of possible search-term-based definitions for initial symptom onset, based on various combinations of the earliest-peaking search terms \"fever\", \"cough\", \"coronavirus symptoms\" and \"coronavirus test\". Table 3 shows the lags between these different definitions for initial symptom onset and searches for \"shortness of breath\". The average lag between the searches for \"fever\" and \"shortness of breath\" was 5.22 days [95% CI 3.30-7.14]. For \"cough\" it was 5.16 days [95% CI 3.13-7.18]. These lags, and lags deriving from other symptom onset definitions, are all around 5 days, precisely matching the clinical course of the disease reported in the literature. 14 15 16 17 ",

Search data may be subject to socio-economic, geographic, or other biases inherent in the local digital divide. 13,26 , 27 Even though selecting specific search terms increases the signal to noise ratio, changes in search volumes for symptom-related terms such as \"fever\" could result not only from increases in COVID-19 cases, but also general curiosity about the pandemic, other diseases (e.g. influenza, Lassa fever 28 ), news coverage, or other factors. Due to privacy considerations, search data are provided as aggregated relative search volumes rather than raw counts, so while it is possible to predict an increase in cases, it may be difficult to infer the magnitude of such an increase. While search data have important limitations, laboratory testing is subject to a wide range of limitations listed above, in addition to reliability issues which cause certain types of laboratory tests to need to be repeated in order to increase reliability. 29 30 Recent studies have examined Internet search data related to the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

No physical intervention is required. 6. The data are available for free, independent of the scale of surveillance. Another priority in the early stages of an emergent pandemic such as COVID-19 is to characterize the clinical course of symptoms in affected individuals.
