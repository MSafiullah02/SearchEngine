The results of such informal and formal meetings to focus on the pandemic resulted in the establishment of universal testing protocols for pregnant patients, the suspension of all non-urgent surgeries, and the conversion of operative units to intensive care units (ICUs). In this letter we share the protocol for the care of patients in need of emergent gynecologic surgery.",

Patients with pending SARS-CoV-2 results are considered a person under investigation (PUI) and are treated as COVID-19 positive. A PUI must wear a surgical mask and all personnel in contact with the PUI require personal protective equipment (PPE). This PPE includes an N95 mask underneath a surgical mask, a face shield or eye goggles, a gown, double gloves, head covering, and shoe covers. There are designated PPE coordinators in each unit to ensure proper distribution of supplies for the safety of staff.",

Our institution has two OR's assigned for PUI and COVID-19 positive patients; these rooms are large, and well-ventilated. Once the patient is in the OR, only the anesthesia team remains in the room for anesthesia induction. Intubations are performed using the assistance of a video laryngoscope while the patient is placed under a clear plastic sheet to reduce viral spread. After intubation, the surgical team returns to the room which is then deemed a restricted zone to minimize all traffic in and out ( Figure 1 ).",

At the conclusion of the procedure the nursing and anesthesia team leave due to staff shortage and redeployment to COVID units as experienced by other institutions as well. Because our post anesthesia care units are also currently ICU's, the patient completes postoperative recovery in the OR while monitored by the surgical team. Once meeting milestones for discharge, he/she is escorted from the OR to the hospital exit by the surgical team to reduce patient exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Figure 1 ). COVID-19 pandemic has been a unique time where healthcare workers have come together nationally and internationally, sharing their experiences for patient care. As others continue to see an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases we encourage everyone to look at national and international organizations and large institutional protocols in care of not just COVID-19 patients but all patients in order to assure the safety of patients, and staff.",
