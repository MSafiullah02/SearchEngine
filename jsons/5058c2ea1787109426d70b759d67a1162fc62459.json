Radiological imaging plays a key role in the diagnostic process and during the monitoring of the clinical conditions especially of patients with severe symptoms. According to the preliminary data collected in our tertiary center, we have documented a peculiar behavior in patients requiring endotracheal intubation who underwent seriate chest X-rays. In fact, the radiological pattern of COVID-19 patients may worsen despite a prompt amelioration after the onset of mechanical ventilation. Thus, according to our initial evidence, we recommend to perform seriate chest X-rays in the days following the onset of mechanical ventilation even if the immediate monitoring suggests an improvement. Studies on a larger scale are necessary to fully assess the findings at chest radiographs of critical, mechanically ventilated patients and their correlation with the long-term outcome.",

Nevertheless, in the following days, over an interval of 6 days from intubation, four patients previously stable or with a former improvement (overall 33.3%) had a rapid worsening of the The first radiograph at admission demonstrated a mild interstitial thickening in the lower lobes (a). Within 72 h from hospital admission, his clinical conditions worsened and bilateral pulmonary consolidations became visible at chest X-ray (b). The same day he was intubated with a prompt improvement of the radiological findings especially in the left lung (c). In the next 24 h after the beginning of the mechanical ventilation, the bilateral pulmonary consolidations increased (d) clinical conditions; four patients (22.3%) remained stable and eight progressively improved (44.4%). At the chest X-ray performed at admission, nine showed an interstitial pattern and eight pulmonary consolidations. Only one had a negative chest X-ray which then evolved within 24 h in consolidations. Within 6 days, 89% of the patients (n = 16) showed a wide patch of parenchymal consolidations at imaging, a finding which is consistent with the literature [3, 4] . One patient died 18 days after hospital admission.",
