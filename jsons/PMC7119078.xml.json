The components of contact tracing included the following: obtaining all patient movements during the symptomatic stage; identifying the persons who had contact with the patient during these movements; and instituting follow-up action on the contacts for a 10-day period. A trigger board chaired by the Director of Medical Services decided on the classification and priority of each notified case. The triggers to activate contact tracing covered a broad spectrum of possibilities and included the following: all probable and suspect cases; cases of atypical pneumonia pending confirmation; fever >38\u00b0C with travel history to SARS-affected area; cluster of fever cases in a health care or step-down facility; unexplained fevers; death because of pneumonia without identifiable cause; and postmortem findings of respiratory distress syndrome.",

As challenges to contact tracing arose in health care settings, airline flights, cruise vessels, large educational institutions, hostels, factories, markets, food centers, places of worship, public buildings, and a mental hospital, our experience underscored the importance of maintaining a high level of vigilance and the preparedness to act and adjust strategies. Based on the lessons learned, policies were periodically modified to reduce the numbers that truly warranted monitoring without compromising public health (eg, from initial entire planeloads of passengers, contacts were later limited to those seated in physical proximity to the index patient).6 Inherent in the contact tracing operation was the assurance of health checks and careful follow-up of all identified contacts. The management workflow for contact tracing is shown in\nFig 1.",

Even then, for the first few close contacts of SARS cases, MOH only provided a health advisory document to alert the contacts that they had been exposed to SARS and what they should/should not do for 2 weeks following exposure. On March 24, 2003, when MOH invoked the Infectious Diseases Act to impose quarantine on persons who had been exposed to SARS and were potentially infectious, the provisions were found to be inadequate because it was not an offence for persons to break quarantine. The Act merely stipulated that, if a person should do so, he/she would be placed under isolation in a hospital or in any other suitable place, and it would only be an offence if the person escaped from such isolation. The Act also did not provide the legal powers to order the quarantine for those who have been treated for SARS or suspected SARS after their discharge from hospital.",

The order signed by the director was known as the Home Quarantine Order (HQO), of which there were 3 types: (1) HQO for contacts of probable cases of SARS: This was served on all who had come in contact with a probable SARS patient. These contacts were placed on HQO for a period of 10 days from the date of last exposure to the SARS patient. The HQO document underwent several modifications to reflect developments that included the use of electronic picture cameras and tagging, an HQO allowance, and the listing of the particulars of children living in the same household who also had to be under quarantine. (2) HQO for probable and suspected SARS cases who were admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH)/Communicable Disease Centre (CDC), the designated SARS hospital, upon their discharge: All those who were treated for SARS or admitted for suspect SARS were required to be placed on HQO for a further 10 days after discharge. This was because little was known about the period of infectivity and whether the SARS patient was infectious during the convalescent phase of illness. There were additional concerns of whether a suspect case could have been infected with SARS without the typical clinical manifestations and of whether the patients would suffer a relapse upon discharge. (3) HQO for patients in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and TTSH who have concomitant chronic diseases, upon their discharge: Patients with certain concurrent medical conditions were also placed on HQO for a period of 10 days following discharge from hospital. This followed realization that patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart failure and patients who were immunosuppressed because of cancer or steroid therapy could be sources of SARS without showing the typical signs and symptoms.",

With this arrangement, auxiliary police officers replaced health officers in serving the HQO at the homes of the identified contacts. The quarantined persons were required to stay home throughout the 10-day period, monitor temperature twice daily and check for symptoms, and provide information fully and truthfully when required via telephone. Children staying in the same household were disallowed from attending school during this period. CISCO officers made random checks and called the contacts between 8 am and 11 pm daily to ensure that they were at home. There were instances when such persons diverted the home telephone number to their hand telephone to give an impression of compliance. Consequently, surveillance was tightened by installing an electronic picture camera in each home. These cameras were normally switched off to maintain privacy but, when called, the person had to turn on the camera and present himself in front of it to show that he/she was really at home.",

The emergence of a novel disease provided the unique opportunity to test the implementation of contact tracing and quarantine to effect disease containment.7 The decision to undertake these measures was not based on scientific evidence of the merits of quarantine but on an urgent need to protect the community from a serious new disease that carried a high case fatality of 14%.

Our experience of mounting large-scale quarantine operations confirmed the necessity of having proper systems in place within an organizational framework for resources to be deployed effectively. Once the framework was established, the logistics of large-scale quarantine became doable. Nonetheless, given the commitment of resources, other disease investigation routines and health promotion activities had to be placed on hold or delayed. The public health operations were successful because it was possible to define the persons who were exposed to a symptomatic SARS case and hence at risk of spreading the disease. Those quarantined were also agreeable to being confined at home. Health education by visiting nurses, rigorous electronic surveillance, and financial incentives probably contributed to the low rate of 0.3% noncompliance with quarantine. There were many legal and operational obstacles that had to be overcome, but the government showed determination by committing the necessary resources to make quarantine action work.",

Identification, on average, of 38 contacts per case showed a tendency toward error on the side of caution. This strategy worked because, by reducing many of the potential reservoirs of infection, opportunities for the virus to spread in the community remained rare and the outbreak was limited very much to nosocomial (health care setting) and intrahousehold infection. On the other hand, the same strategy resulted in quarantining large numbers of people who eventually turned out not to have SARS, giving a very low yield of under 0.5%. This was similar to the experience in other countries and suggests that efficiency could be improved greatly in future outbreaks by improving the specificity of criteria used in defining the contacts for quarantine.8, 9\n",
