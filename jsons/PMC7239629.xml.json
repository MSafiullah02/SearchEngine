Since the beginning of this pandemic, headlines have also captured stories of health-care personnel facing attacks as they travel to and from health-care facilities. Nurses and doctors have been pelted with eggs and physically assaulted in Mexico.1 In the Philippines, a nurse was reportedly attacked by men who poured bleach on his face, damaging his vision.2 Across India, reports describe health-care workers being beaten, stoned, spat on, threatened, and evicted from their homes.3 These are just a few examples among many across numerous countries, including the USA and Australia.2\n",

What makes the current attacks specifically horrifying is that health-care personnel are responding to a crisis that is deeply affecting all societies. Governmental failures in some countries to adequately provide and manage resources in this pandemic mean that health-care personnel are risking their lives daily by caring for COVID-19 patients without adequate personal protective equipment and other safety measures in their workplaces.7 As a result, thousands of health-care workers worldwide have contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have thus been perceived as public health hazards themselves.8 This situation has generated violence against them in some places, essentially for performing their professional duties. This response is likely to exacerbate already unprecedented COVID-19-related stress and burnout that health-care workers and their families are experiencing in this pandemic.",

National and international bodies such as WHO must engage in a coordinated global effort. And this initiative must incorporate lessons learned from previous efforts to document violence against health-care personnel, such as attacks on those leading polio vaccination campaigns or who cared for patients with Ebola virus disease.10 Data on attacks specific to COVID-19 should be systematically gathered and included in the WHO Surveillance System of Attacks on Healthcare. Global support from all member states and their communities for this effort is essential to achieve a robust surveillance system. National data should be collected by ministries of health or occupational health and safety bodies. Mechanisms to analyse, share, and widely disseminate this information on violence against health-care personnel need to be developed or expanded, following the example of the reports from the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition11 and data gathered by Insecurity Insight,12 among others.",
