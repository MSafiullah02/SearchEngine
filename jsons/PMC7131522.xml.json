            "text": "To the etiology of virus-infected diseases, the farthest and worst outcomes will be in the changes of cellular genome. If these deadest virus or their influences really enter or devour into human genomes of infected cells in nature, we will not surprise why routine vaccines and exogenous chemical drugs could not eradicate the diseases after so many laboratory endeavors and high expenses of money. Therefore, we propose that final solution and eradication of these deadest diseases will only be based on thorough understanding the courses and ranges of virus infections. Since human genome project (HGP) has been just finished and has great potential in medicine [5], is it better to sequence the whole genome of infected human cells obtained from diseased patients? This strategy, though cumbersome and lack of experimental data to support, but it can be really reliable at present situations. It is a bold hypothesis and risky attempt, for we may find nothing but cost high. But the advantages for the project are also obvious because the project will pinpoint and identify the etiology and pathology of these diseases in detail and to the fullest, which can find useful and realizable biotherapies much easier and in faster speed. According to present technology, these combined DNA infection could only be rectified or silenced by biotherapy. This is one of the significances of the project. If it works, it must be an excellent model for finding ways and solution for most of virus-infected diseases. Our hypothesis is more imaginative and innovative than current attempted mainstream treatment option (vaccine and cocktail therapy). We believe people can really benefit from the project. Can we present our proposal open for discussion here? What is the most possible virus to undergo such change? Can we try to find one to initiate?",
