A striking example of this relationship was provided by bacteriological and histopathological analysis of infected lung tissue obtained from people who died of influenza during the 1918\u20131919 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d pandemic, in whom bacterial pneumonia was found to be the predominant cause of death [1].

            "text": "Several studies have evaluated immunological interactions between influenza and bacterial infections, including infections with Gram-negative bacteria [3]. In vitro studies in which influenza-infected alveolar macrophages were subsequently stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial compound that induces a profound innate immune response, revealed increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6 [4\u20138], indicative of a priming effect on these cells by influenza. Data from in vivo animal studies are ambiguous. Similar to the in vitro data, some report enhanced responses. For instance, influenza infection in mice was shown to enhance the inflammatory response and neuropathogenicity resulting from LPS administration on days 3 and 4 after influenza inoculation [9]. Likewise, murine influenza infection resulted in increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both plasma and lungs, and enhanced pulmonary neutrophil influx upon pneumococcal infection 7 days later [10]. Similar results were observed in mice 14 days after influenza infection [11]. However, two otherwise largely comparable studies demonstrated reduced pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations upon Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice infected with influenza 7 days before, indicative of influenza-induced immunosuppression [12, 13]. These equivocal results may be due to differences in the severity or kinetics of the influenza infection or the use of different bacteria as secondary challenges, thereby targeting various complex multi-receptor signaling pathways. Also, the use of live bacteria could have contributed to these ambiguous results. For instance, if influenza would induce immunosuppression and thereby facilitate outgrowth of bacteria upon a secondary live infectious challenge, the increased bacterial burden can eventually result in fulminant inflammation, which would wrongfully suggest influenza-induced augmentation of the immune response.",

Mean \u00b1 SD (533 \u00b1 163 pg/mL) TNF-\u03b1 plasma levels were obtained from previous work from our group, in which male C57BL/6J mice were also injected intravenously with 5 mg/kg LPS and sacrificed 90 min later [14].

The effect size was based on previous work [9], in which influenza infection modulated the plasma cytokine response to LPS administration by at least 50%. Comparisons were analyzed using unpaired Student\u2019s t tests and repeated measures one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as indicated in the figure legends.

Furthermore, this effect remained present, although less pronounced, in the recovery phase of influenza infection (10 days post-infection). The LPS-induced increase in MPO content in lung homogenates, reflecting pulmonary neutrophil influx or sequestration, tended to be enhanced in the acute phase of influenza infection as well.

For example, a preceding influenza infection in mice gravely enhanced lung injury induced by a secondary infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae 7 days later, resulting in a severe necrotic pneumonia accompanied by increased mortality [10]. Also, the increased MPO content observed in our study is an important hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [15, 16], a severe complication of influenza infection caused by excessive pulmonary inflammation. These and our study reveal that the enhancing effect on the pro-inflammatory innate immune response is most evident in the lungs, probably because the influenza-induced damage and consequent inflammatory effects are most pronounced at this site. In this context, our data are in line with the recommendation to use corticosteroids in patients with severe influenza infections in the Intensive Care Unit to counteract the pulmonary hyperinflammatory response causing ARDS. Several underlying mechanisms may contribute to the observed effects. At the cellular level, studies have shown that influenza and certain bacterial pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, utilize similar immunological pathways and that the overlap in the inflammatory mediators produced thereby creates augmentation of the immune response during sequential infection, in turn causing immunopathology [17, 18]. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that influenza stimulates TNF-\u03b1 gene transcription activators or may interfere with labile transcription repressor proteins and stabilizes TNF-\u03b1 mRNA by delaying its degradation [8]. Alternatively, the increased lung MPO levels observed do not necessarily reflect PMN infiltration into the lungs, but may (also) result from PMNs trapped in the vasculature, as circulating activated neutrophils become rigid and can be trapped within the small capillaries of the lung [19]. As such, increased entrapment of leukocytes in the pulmonary vasculature during influenza infection could also contribute to the enhanced inflammatory cytokine levels upon LPS challenge. We can only speculate on this, because no histological data are available, which represents a limitation of this work.",

            "text": "It may be argued that the enhanced pro-inflammatory immune response induced by influenza serves as a means to efficiently eliminate the primary pathogen and to enhance host defense towards a secondary infection. For instance, pro-inflammatory cytokines are induced in influenza-infected cells to limit viral replication and to initiate downstream immune responses [20]. However, this is not supported by previous work, where an increased bacterial burden was observed irrespective of an enhanced or suppressed response [11\u201313]. Several explanations for this observation may be put forward. First, next to potentiating pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, the present study and work by others [11] have shown that influenza infection also potentiates production of the key anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which was demonstrated to be crucial in facilitating bacterial outgrowth upon secondary challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae [11]. Second, influenza may on the one hand prime for production of innate cytokines produced by myeloid cells, but impair T cell-derived cytokines that are instrumental for the adaptive immune response. This was elegantly demonstrated by Kudva et al., who showed that, in line with our results, infection with Staphylococcus aureus 6 days after influenza resulted in increased pulmonary levels of innate cytokines such as IL-6 and MCP-1, and increased neutrophil influx to the lungs, but decreased concentrations of T-cell-derived IL-17 and IL-22, which were demonstrated to play a pivotal role in fending off the staphylococcal infection [21].",

            "text": "Whereas the enhancing effects of influenza on pro-inflammatory innate immune parameters were less pronounced at 10 days post-infection, a suppressed response was neither evident. This could be partly biased by the exclusion of two mice in both recovery groups due to severe influenza infection. However, it might also be argued that 10 days post-infection is too soon for these effects to manifest. For example, profound desensitization towards LPS and flagellin, another Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand, was observed in alveolar macrophages obtained from mice up to 6 weeks after influenza infection [22]. Furthermore, the direction of the response upon a secondary challenge is probably highly dependent on the pathogen or stimulus used, each using distinct intracellular signaling pathways. With regard to this, it is well-known that influenza virus particularly predisposes to Aspergillus fumigatus, which is present in 25% of all influenza patients [23, 24], causing infections such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis that are associated with very high mortality rates. As different mechanisms may be important in host defense towards various pathogens, the specific response towards Aspergillus fumigatus could be suppressed by a preceding influenza infection. The use of corticosteroids may be another important factor in the observed vulnerability towards particular secondary infections, as steroid use was shown to be independently associated with the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus in sputum of cystic fibrosis patients [25] and with a substantially increased risk of community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [26]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis revealed that the use of corticosteroids was significantly associated with nosocomial infections [27]. To the best of our knowledge, these putative detrimental effects of corticosteroid treatment during influenza on secondary infections have yet to be studied systematically in animal models. In any case, it remains to be determined whether the overall effects of corticosteroid treatment are beneficial or not, as they may lead to increased susceptibility in a subset of influenza virus-infected patients but may also provide health benefits in another subset of influenza virus-infected patients.",
