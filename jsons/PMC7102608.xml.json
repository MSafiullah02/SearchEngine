This pathogen results in a syndrome leading in some cases to a critical care respiratory condition, that requires specialized management at intensive care units (ICU) in many of them [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]].

As expected, several similarities and differences in the epidemiology, clinical features, and management of SARS, MERS, and COVID have been identified [[3], [4], [5],[20], [21], [22], [23]]. These are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses isolated from bats that share sequence homology with isolates from humans, suggesting bats as natural hosts and reservoirs [9,[24], [25], [26], [27]]. Although the clinical picture of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 seems to be similar, differences were noted [4,5,21,28] since early reports. A full clinical characterization of this disease, as well as its laboratory and image characteristics, is required.",

Many of these reports have started to answer clinical questions, including evolution and outcomes, as well as potential risk factors, and clinical, laboratory and image findings; however, a systematic review to consolidate what has been learned from each study or reported case is to-date missing. Although systematic reviews and meta-analyses usually include randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and aim to provide a more precise estimate of the effect of a treatment or risk factor for disease, also have been extensively used, especially during the last decades, to synthesized observational studies [[31], [32], [33]]. In many situations, RCTs are not feasible or available, and only data from observational studies are accessible [33]. This is the case for the clinical, laboratory, and image features of COVID-19.",

Although as of March 9, 2020, there have been more than 111,000 cases reported, these have not been included and published in studies available in the literature. Most studies were cross-sectional (15), and four were case series (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5\n). We analyzed 42 variables for the meta-analyses (Table 6\n). Publication bias was assessed with a funnel plot for the standard error by logit event, with no evidence of bias (Fig. S1). Additionally, the Egger test (P = 0.801) suggested that there was no notable evidence of publication bias.",

At least one-fifth of cases require supportive care in medical intensive care units, which is especially limited in most developing countries. Despite the implementation of optimal supportive interventions, case fatality rate among hospitalized patients is more than 10%. Similar to other viral respiratory pathogens, COVID-19 presents in the majority of cases with a rapidly progressive course of fever, cough and dyspnea. Important distinguishing factors are leukopenia and the rapid progression to ARDS. Eliciting a history of recent travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of this emerging pathogen or contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, should prompt clinicians to initiate isolation precautions and obtain laboratory confirmation. Additional research is needed to elucidate viral and host factors in the pathogenesis of severe and fatal infections.",
