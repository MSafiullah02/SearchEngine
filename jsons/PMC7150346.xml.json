The emergence of resistance to penicillin among Str. pneumoniae isolates represents a gradual reduction in in-vitro susceptibility. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards defines strains for which the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin is <1 mg/L as sensitive, 1.0\u20132.0 mg/L as intermediate and \u22654 mg/L as resistant.55 With Str. pneumoniae, the DNA incorporation and remodeling that results in resistance is from the DNA of closely related oral commensal bacteria (see\nCh. 3). By such a process, our own flora can develop resistance when we are treated with antibiotics and pathogens such as Str. pneumoniae can subsequently acquire resistance coding DNA from our own colonizing microflora.56 Pneumococcal resistance to \u03b2-lactams is due solely to the presence of low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins. Macrolide resistance, however, can occur either by target site modification or by an efflux pump (see\nChs 3 and 22). The relative frequencies of the two mechanisms vary internationally but in North America account for approximately 45% and 55%, respectively, of resistant isolates. Reports of breakthrough pneumococcal bacteremia in patients treated with macrolides have highlighted concerns about resistance to this class of agents.57,\n58\n",

In the USA, between 1995 and 1998, the proportion of invasive pneumococcal isolates that were resistant to three or more classes of drugs increased from 9% to 14%; there also were increases in the proportions of isolates that were resistant to penicillin (21% to 25%), cefotaxime (10% to 15%), meropenem (10% to 16%), erythromycin (11% to 16%) and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole (25% to 29%). These increases in frequency of resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents occurred in penicillin-resistant isolates only.61 Drug-resistant Str. pneumoniae is associated with various risk factors including the presence of co-morbidities, such as chronic heart, lung, liver or renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, immunosuppression or use of antimicrobials within the previous 3 months.62 Infection with drug-resistant pneumococci results in invasive disease with higher mortality rates amongst hospitalized individuals.63\n",

For outpatients, the BTS does not consider that atypical pathogens such as M. pneumoniae or Ch. pneumoniae are important enough to warrant routine coverage, and therefore treatment is aimed primarily at Str. pneumoniae, for which the drug of choice is amoxicillin. For hospital inpatients, the North American document divides patients into those managed on a ward or in the ICU, whereas the British guidelines consider hospital-treated patients under three categories: (1) not severe and admitted for non-clinical reasons or previously treated in the community (CURB65 0\u20131); (2) moderate severity (CURB65 = 2); and (3) severe (CURB65 3\u20135). The first group is treated with amoxicillin, the second is given amoxicillin plus a macrolide (erythromycin or clarithromycin) and the third group is given a \u03b2-lactam (amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate) plus intravenous erythromycin or clarithromycin. Fluoroquinolones are recommended as an alternative only for the second and third categories. In general, the potency and breadth of intravenous antibiotics recommended increases as severity increases. In moderately ill hospitalized patients treated in the UK, a simple \u03b2-lactam in combination with a macrolide is likely to be used, if clinicians follow the BTS guidelines. Individual hospital policies will be tailored to balance the requirement for potent therapy, with the need to keep antimicrobial activity as narrow spectrum as possible to avoid potential impacts on hospital ecology.",

In cases of CAP, the predominant etiological agents are Str. pneumoniae and the atypicals (in selected cases Gram-negative rods may be encountered). In nursing home pneumonia, Str. pneumoniae is still a significant pathogen, but (it is important to note that age >65 years and residence in a nursing home have been identified as risk factors for penicillin-resistant Str. pneumoniae infection) there is a greater proportion of cases caused by Staph. aureus, H. influenzae and Gram-negative rods in this population than in a younger cohort, and a disconcertingly high percentage of the Staph. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant.70 Atypicals are more common in younger patients.",

While it is recognized that a large number of bacteria are potential pathogens, there is a \u2018core\u2019 group of organisms that must be considered for each patient for whom antimicrobial coverage must be provided (Table 45.4\n). This group consists of Gram-negative bacilli (such as Enterobacter spp., Esch. coli, Klebsiella and Proteus spp., Ser. marcescens), H. influenzae, Staph. aureus and Str. pneumoniae. Depending upon the risk factors present and the severity of illness, anaerobes, methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, Legionella spp., Ps. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. should also be considered.",

Until the evidence base surrounding nosocomial pneumonia improves, variations in practice are likely to continue. The decision to select an agent should be based upon the host, pathogen and drug-related issues outlined earlier. A few specific issues, however, deserve comment. Single-agent therapy is recommended in many situations. Although two drugs should be used to achieve synergistic or additive activity against Ps. aeruginosa, there are no data to support the routine use of combination therapy for other bacterial pathogens in non-neutropenic patients.81\n",
