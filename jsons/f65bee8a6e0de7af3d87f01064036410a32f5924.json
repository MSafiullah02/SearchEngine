However, such important immune functions are known to decline with age in many mammals, including humans. It is a matter of clinical importance that the incidence of various age-associated diseases such as infections, cancer and vascular disorders increases with a decrease in immunological vigor. The extent of immunologic decline is variable and exhibits wide inter-individual variations. Thus, it is important to assess the extent of immunologic decline in both patients suffering from various diseases and in healthy people in order to maintain healthy conditions. To this end, we have developed a scoring system that analyzes immune parameters according to a database of known age-associated immune changes obtained from a healthy population. Using this scoring system, we can combine several different immunological parameters and express the immune status of individuals as a simple numeral.",

In many countries, the mean life span has increased steadily during the first half of the 20 th century, however, this has not been the case in Japan. The increase in the mean lifespan was outstanding in the second half of the 20 th century (after the Second World War) in Japan.

With regard to infection, Pawelec et al. (2004) suggested that chronic antigenic stimulation could lead to an increased prev- alence of senescent dysfunctional T-cells, and therefore contribute to more general alterations in the immune system. Furthermore, elderly people face an indefinite number of problems such as pain in the shoulder, arm or leg, dizziness, staggering and headaches. In addition, chronic inflammatory symptoms such as bronchitis, laryngitis or adenoiditis are very common in the elderly.",

Indefinite problems are attributable to variable causes including various diseases and psychological stress, but one of the major causes is inadequate adaptation to variable stresses from the external environment. Nervous, endocrine and immune systems work together to maintain the internal environment, when the body is exposed to the stresses from physical, psychological and biological surroundings. In the elderly, however, the function of all these three systems declines with age, resulting in improper adaptation to stress. Therefore, restoration of immunological function would be quite helpful for the elderly not only to prevent infection, but also maintain their internal environment at the time of exposure to stress. In other words, immunological restoration is expected to be effective for the improvement of the QOL in the elderly.",

We have been studying the immunological aspect of aging for many years and have confirmed that immune functions are susceptible to aging, diseases and stress. For the past 30 years, many studies including ours have shown that the age-related decline mainly occurs in Tcell-dependent immune functions and is relatively small in functions of other cells such as B-cells, macrophages and NK-cells (Makinodan and Kay 1980; Hirokawa 1992; Linton and Dorshkind 2004; Hirokawa et al. 2006) . Therefore, when considering the age-related change of immunological functions, the immunological assessment can be focused on parameters that are related to T-cell-dependent functions. We have reported that the age-related change in the T-cell-dependent immune system is observed in a decrease in the T-cells number, a change in the T-cell subpopulations and a qualitative change in T-cells such as a decline in proliferative capacity and a change in cytokine production (Fig. 2) .",

Since it is difficult to imagine the immunological level of each individual by merely looking at the numbers of the 10 parameters, we have tried to represent the immunological level of each individual Fig. 3 Process of scoring and grading immunological parameters. Values of immunological parameters are given a score from 1 to 3. Sum total of 10 scores is named scoring of immunological vigor (SIV-10). SIV-10 is then classified into 5 grades as shown in Table 2 . It is generally difficult to determine immunological status of individuals by a mere list of figures of 10 parameters. By the scoring system, 10 parameters can be grouped and expressed numerically as immunological score or grade in a plain style. The value of each immunological parameter falls within a range specified in a database and each parameter was scored into 3 grades based on its value. In particular, values in the range of a cumulative frequency less than 10% of values observed for healthy subject were scored 1, which indicates a low immunity level; those between 10% and 40% were scored 2, which indicates a moderate immunity level; and those with 40% or higher were scored 3, which indicates a sufficiently high immunity level. Since higher scores of CD4/CD8 ratios are frequently observed in very old people and patients suffering from diseases, values greater than 80% of the cumulative frequency were scored 2, which indicates a moderate immunity level. We employed 3 options to assess SIV; the first using 10 parameters, named SIV-10; the second using 7 parameters excluding cytokine production, named SIV-7 and the third using 5 parameters composed of T-cell-related functions, named SIV-5 or T-cell immune score.",

Thus, it has been expected that enzymes or substances that compete with oxidative stress are candidates for antiaging medicines. Antioxidant enzymes are present in our body, e.g., SOD and catalase. It is possible to enhance the production of these antioxidant enzymes by appropriate physical exercise. In addition, there are many kinds of supplements that are commercially available as antioxidant chemicals, although effectiveness of most of them has not been proved scientifically.

Treatment with a high dose of CY also induced apoptosis in the thymus, but suppressed the proliferative capacity, thereby, not leading to an enhancement of immune capacity.

The results suggest that intrinsic cellular change of the immune system is more responsible for the immune deficiencies in the aged than the environmental or structural tissue changes including connective tissues and humoral factors. In thymus grafting, however, thymic stromal tissues rather than thymocytes are important for the restoration of T-cell-dependent immune system. For human application, the transplantation of bone-marrow cells is becoming easier, but it is almost impossible to find donors of young thymuses. Further, donors need to have the same MHC type as the recipients. Thymus transplantation may be performed, if an autologous thymus can be partially removed at a young age and stored in liquid nitrogen.",

Many studies including ours ) have revealed that the intrinsic cellular changes are mainly observed in T-cells; i.e., decrease in number, changes in composition of subpopulations and qualitative changes such as proliferative activity and cytokine production. In fact, T-cells from old individuals do not proliferate efficiently in vitro, but the proliferation can be promoted in the presence of anti-CD3 and IL-2. Thus, activated T-cells in vitro are expected to restore the declined immune functions of aged mice and humans. This treatment was already employed for cancer treatment as an immunotherapy, e.g., lymphokine activated killer cells (LAK) (Rosenberg 2001 ).",

In this study we employed a congenic combination of B10.Thy1.1 mice (young and old) as donors and C57BL/6 Thy1.2 mice (young and old) as recipients, to determine how many activated T-cells survived in the recipients. The mice were sacrificed 11 days and 25 days after the infusion of activated T-cells and used for immunological assessment. For the infusion of activated T-cells, splenic lymphocytes were expanded 10-to 15-folds in the presence of immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and IL-2. Lymphocytes activated in this way were composed of mostly T-cells in which approximately 70 to 80% were CD8 + T-cells and 7 to 14% were CD4 + T-cells. The activated T-cells prepared from old mice donors contained many more CD8 T-cells. Although CD4+ T-cells were smaller in number than CD8+ T-cells, most of them expressed a phenotype of na\u00efve T-cells. After infusion of activated T-cells, the absolute number of T-cells significantly increased in the spleen of the recipient mice, especially of old mice. In the peripheral blood and spleen, donor-type Thy-1.1 T-cells were significantly more numerous in old recipients than in young ones. In addition, the number of donor-type T-cells that survived was significantly high in the spleen than in the peripheral blood in both young and old recipients. The magnitude of antibody formation against SRBC did not change significantly in young recipients. About half of the old recipients, however, showed a significant enhancement of antibody formation. It is of importance to note that such an enhanced antibody formation was observed in old recipients infused with activated T-cells either from young or old donors.",

T-cells expanded in a nonspecific manner may contain harmful T-cells exhibiting autoimmune activity.

The values varied across cases and were unsuitable for statistical analysis. After the infusion of activated autologous T-cells, an improvement in TCPI was observed in 11 out of 14 cases. The average value of TCPI before the infusion was 1.02, which is apparently lower than that observed in colonic cancer stages I to IV (1.21). After the infusion, the average TCPI was increased to 1.49, although it was definitely lower than that of healthy controls (1.70). It was not obvious whether the infusion of activated autologous T-cells was effective in reducing the tumor size, but most of the patients revealed that in general, they experienced an improvement in their health status after the infusion. Improvement of immunological function can not be expected in cancer patients whose T-cell expansion in vitro is less efficient. Thus, we have to consider the source of T-cells. A good technique is to obtain T-cells not from patients suffering from cancer, but from individuals in healthy condition. For this purpose we need to obtain peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy peoples and these lymphocytes should be kept in the frozen state. The process can be named as T-cell-bank and the system to establish T-cells bank is now under way. ",
