In recent years we have witnessed several infectious diseases spread well beyond their previously understood geographic boundaries, as was demonstrated by the introduction of Zika virus to the Americas. We have also witnessed the emergence and spread of novel pathogens, such as the discovery of a previously unknown Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia spreading to distant countries such as South Korea [1].",

In particular, human travel and migration (especially via air travel) is now a major driving force pushing infections into previously nonendemic settings. Year by year, there are increasing numbers of international tourists [2], more international refugees and migrants [3], greater capacity for shipping by sea [4], and greater international air travel passenger volumes [5]. Air travel poses a growing threat to global health security, as it is now possible for a traveler harboring an infection in one location on earth to travel to virtually any other point on the planet in only 1\u20132 days. Infections introduced via travel may be sporadic and have little potential for further transmission, such as Lassa fever introduced into European settings [6]. In other situations, infections introduced by air travel may cause self-limited local epidemics such as Chikungunya virus in Italy [7]. More recently, there are a growing number of examples of infections introduced to a new region that ultimately become endemic, such as Chikungunya virus in Latin America and the Caribbean [8].",

Such vectors have the potential to infect nontravelers in their new destination, as is seen in airport malaria [6]. Even if a vector is not infected, that vector may become endemic to a new region if there are suitable environmental conditions, and then potentially enable future epidemics. The most well-known example of this is the now-global distribution of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, the vectors responsible for a number of arbovirus infections including dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika viruses [9]. Vector introduction is further facilitated by ecological factors, such as climate change and urbanization, that may enable vectors to flourish in new regions.",

Preparation for planning mass gatherings, such as large sporting events or an annual religious pilgrimage, require special consideration for the potential of these events to contribute to global outbreaks. Here, we outline emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that are spread via human mobility, with a focus on air travel.

Though once well controlled, dengue virus re-emerged in Asia in the 1950s, and is now endemic or epidemic in many tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Its re-emergence over the past half-century has been driven by urbanization, globalization, inadequate vector control [55], and, notably, increasing human travel 56, 57. Autochthonous transmission has now been described in the USA, France, Croatia, and Madeira 58, 59, 60, all imported by infected travelers. Air travel is contributing to the increasing frequency of epidemics as new serotypes are introduced into susceptible populations by travelers 61, 62. Interestingly, there is emerging evidence that individuals infected with dengue virus who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic (and presumably have lower levels of viremia) are still able to infect competent mosquito vectors. Such individuals may be more prone to traveling given their lack of symptoms, and are likely contributing to global dengue virus transmission 63, 64.",

It causes a self-limited febrile illness with a syndrome of arthralgia or arthritis that may last for weeks to months after infection. Chikungunya virus was originally endemic in African and Asian settings, but has caused localized epidemics in Italy in 2007, and in Italy and France in 2017 7, 60, 65, 66. The 2007 epidemic in Italy was initiated by a single viremic traveler returning from India [7], highlighting the role of air travel in its spread. In December of 2013, autochthonous cases of Chikungunya infection appeared in Saint Martin, also likely introduced by a viremic traveler. Given the appropriate ecological suitability and competent vectors for transmission, Chikungunya virus rapidly spread throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, affecting 46 countries and over 3 million people, and is now endemic in the Americas [67]. An evaluation of global travel patterns from endemic locations predicted that imported cases of Chikungunya would be common in New York, Miami, and Puerto Rico, with autochthonous transmission in the latter two regions [8], which was ultimately realized 1 year later [68].",

The virus has a predilection for developing nervous systems, and microcephaly is well documented in children born to infected pregnant mothers [70]. Zika virus originated in Africa and spread slowly eastward to Asia during the second half of the 20th century, culminating in a large outbreak on the Yap island in 2007 [69]. This was followed by a number of smaller outbreaks in Pacific islands, eventually resulting in an unprecedented epidemic in Brazil in 2015 that spread through much of Latin America and the Caribbean [71]. Although the index case was not identified, molecular clock analyses suggest that the virus was introduced multiple times in 2013 or 2014 from viremic travelers [71]. The virus was accurately predicted to spread throughout Latin America and the Caribbean based on human air travel patterns from Brazil, to regions with suitable ecological conditions and competent mosquito vectors for disease transmission [72]. Similarly, Zika virus is predicted to be reintroduced to African and Asia-Pacific nations based on current air travel patterns 73, 74. It is currently unclear if Zika virus will be established as an endemic infection in Latin American and Caribbean nations, though there are several parallels with Chikungunya virus in this region, suggesting that this is a likely scenario [75].",

Treatment of organisms harboring antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes is associated with treatment failures, worse clinical outcomes, and greater expense [77]. The devastating economic and health impacts of AMR are expected to be amplified in low-income countries [78]. The rapid rise of broad-spectrum AMR among Gram-negative bacteria, especially the Enterobacteraciae, is a growing public health threat. Soon after the development of extended-spectrum cephalosporins in the 1980s there emerged Enterobacteraciae with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC cephalosporinases [79]. These resistance genes were soon found worldwide in a variety of Gram-negative organisms, including Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and others [80]. Carbapenemases are now increasingly commonplace, conferring resistance to some of the broadest-spectrum antibiotics [81].",

Travelers returning from areas with a high prevalence of AMR often return colonized with resistant organisms, and these individuals can transmit AMR organisms to others [82]. The New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) gene is a recent example of the potential for AMR to spread rapidly. Organisms with NDM-1 are resistant to essentially all cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotic classes [83]. The first case report of NDM-1 was in a traveler who acquired a urinary infection while in India in 2008 [84]. By 2010, NDM-1 was detected in the USA, Canada, Japan, Kenya, Oman, Australia, the United Kingdom, and multiple other European countries [85]. Similarly, colistin resistance with the mobilized colistin resistance-1 (mcr-1) gene is a very concerning development. From its likely origin in China, mcr-1 has been detected in returned travelers around the world 86, 87. Like NDM-1, it can colonize travelers returning from endemic areas [88], and local transmission is now being seen outside of China [89]. These bacteria are emerging far from their site of origin largely due to human travel and agricultural trade. The WHO has recognized AMR as a major global health threat and has enacted a Global Action Plan to help combat its spread [90]. However, large-scale antimicrobial stewardship programs are currently not realized in much of the world.",

            "text": "The revised IHR adopted after the 2002 SARS outbreak was designed to improve global reporting of outbreaks [24] and this document continues to function as an effective data-sharing agreement. While SARS and the revised IHR have resulted in an increased investment in surveillance among higher-income countries, countries with fewer resources but a higher burden of infectious disease epidemics have ongoing challenges operating surveillance programs. Improving global surveillance capacity is a priority, and countries with limited public health capacity may require logistic and infrastructure support for these global systems to function effectively 96, 97. In addition to disease surveillance networks, early-warning systems are increasingly helpful for monitoring the global spread of infectious diseases. Such systems utilize multiple data sources, including voluntary reports, international news, and social media 92, 93, 98, 99. Other systems, such as GeoSentinel and TropNet, coordinate tropical and travel medicine clinics that collect data on illnesses in returned travelers. These travelers essentially act as sentinels of emerging epidemics when a source country does not have the capacity to detect these infections in a timely manner. Such networks have detected a sarcocystis outbreak in Malaysia [100], dengue virus outbreaks in Angola [101], and tracked the spread of Zika virus globally [102]. With improved surveillance and early warning systems, and by harnessing travelers as sentinels, it is possible to piece together a global picture of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Responding to these epidemics, though, still poses several challenges.",

Travel bans and restrictions are generally not helpful in halting the spread of infectious diseases 45, 103, 104, 105, 106. Such policies also may hinder affected countries coping with the epidemic and can impose significant economic burden above the direct costs of the infectious outbreak [107]. Travel restrictions also violate the revised IHR, effectively punishing countries for participating in global disease surveillance and discouraging open communication [108]. Screening of travelers from affected counties also poses logistical problems. Screening commonly relies on either self-reported symptoms (such as an influenza-like illness), which may be inaccurate, or on periodic body temperature screening such as using thermometers or thermal imaging technology. Travelers may be completely asymptomatic if they are in an incubation period during the time of travel, and this may be especially pertinent for infections with longer incubation periods such as Ebola virus [109]. Ultimately, resources may be better channeled to controlling the epidemic at the source.",
