Respiratory syncytial viruses (A&B) were detectable in 45 of 84 (53.6%) nasopharyngeal aspirates from infants with bronchiolitis, whereas coronaviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses were not detectable in the same samples. Adenoviruses were detectable by PCR in 11 of 84 (13.1%) nasopharyngeal swabs. By using a picornavirus RT-PCR assay followed by a differential molecular hybridisation, rhinovirus and enterovirus RNA sequences were detected in 16 of 84 (19%) and in 10 of 84 (11.9%) of the nasopharyngeal swabs tested. Positive human rhinovirus or enterovirus RT-PCR assay, however, was the only evidence of respiratory infection in 8 of 84 (9.5%) and in 7 of 84 (8.33%) of the studied patients. Respiratory syncytial viruses, human rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and enteroviruses occur in dual infections detected in 18 of 84 (21.4%) respiratory samples tested. The median duration of stay in hospital was not significantly different between the patients demonstrating a single viral infection and those with a dual viral infection (6.22 \u00b1 2.07 vs. 5.04 \u00b1 0.95 days; P > 0.05). In summary, combination of molecular and classical detection assays of common viruses can be used to demonstrate enterovirus and human rhinovirus respiratory infection in childhood bronchiolitis, and provides an improved approach to obtain new insights into concomitant viral respi-ratory tract infection in infants.",

Classical im-munofluorescence assay of viral antigens in nasal aspirates is largely used for the viral diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infection by these viral agents. By contrast, conventional laboratory diagnosis of human rhinoviruses infection is based on isolation in cell cultures and confirmation of acid sensitivity. Therefore, the diagnosis of human rhinoviruses respiratory tract infections is limited by the poor sensitivity of cell culture assays and serologic diagnosis is virtually impossible because of the large number of serotypes [Kellner et al., 1988; Eugene-Ruellan et al., 1998; Hyypia et al., 1998 ]. Recently, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) has been used for the identification of both human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses in clinical samples [Atmar et al., 1993; Johnston et al., 1993; Halonen et al., 1995] . The relevance of these molecular assays for the detection of human rhinoviruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates from infants with respiratory tract infection was demonstrated. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies did not examine a large number of clinical samples taken from infants with lower respiratory tract infection or bronchiolitis [Gama et al., 1989; Ireland et al., 1993; Gilbert et al., 1996; Andeweg et al., 1999] .",

Diagnosis of virus respiratory tract infection in bronchiolitis was clearly achieved in patients with a single positive virus detection assay in their nasopharyngeal samples ( Table I) . As previously described, respiratory syncytial virus was the first etiological agent link to symptoms of bronchiolitis in male and female infants [Maletsky et al., 1971; Freymuth et al., 1997] . Surprisingly, coronaviruses, influenza viruses and parainfluenza viruses considered as major infectious etiological agents in childhood bronchiolitis were not detectable in the samples examined, suggesting absence of epidemic outbreaks involving these viruses during our clinical study [Eugene-Ruellan et al., 1998 ].",

RT-PCR assay provides a larger percentage of positive human rhinovirus detection, however, than the positive human rhinovirus culture medium rates (6.7% in infants with bronchiolitis) reported in a previous French study [Freymuth et al., 1986] .",

            "text": "Looking for an association of human rhinoviruses with bronchiolitis, the results presented above demonstrated evidence that 21.4% of immunocompetent infants had a dual respiratory tract infection. Previous serological studies reported that 30% of patients with respiratory syncytial virus also had serological evidence of another simultaneous viral infection. No significant differences in the severity of disease and in the median duration of stay in hospital was found between the infants with dual infections and those with a single virus. Similarly, Portnoy et al. [1965] and Maletzky et al. [1971] did not observe differences in the duration of hospitalisation between the patients infected with one and those infected by more than one respiratory virus. In reports published previously on virus respiratory tract infections, classical immunofluorescence and culture assays identified mixed respiratory in less than 5% of samples examined [Waner, 1994] . Interestingly, the sensitivity of picornavirus RT-PCR and adenovirus PCR assays combined to classical immunofluorescence assay detection of common respiratory viruses permitted the detection of dual respiratory infection in 21.4% of the patients studied. As reported previously, respiratory syncytial virus occurred in 88.8% (16/18) of the mixed infection diagnosed, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus or respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus being the most common identified virus pair (Table II) [Waner, 1994] . In concomitant respiratory infections, virus detection by PCR or RT-PCR could be linked to latent or defective pathogens. Therefore, respiratory virus detection by immunofluorescence detection assay could correspond to a replicative viral infection that should be considered as linked to the clinical illness. In cases of mixed infection, however, picornaviruses and adenoviruses could serve as a clinical illness promotion factor functioning additively or synergistically in bronchiolitis [Waner, 1994] . Therefore, human rhinoviruses or enteroviruses preexisting asymptomatic airway infections could enhance the risk of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in infants. Further clinical studies, including examination of respiratory specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects by quantitative RT-PCR assay detection of common respiratory viral pathogens, will be necessary to investigate the physiopathological and clinical consequences of mixed infections in childhood bronchiolitis.",
