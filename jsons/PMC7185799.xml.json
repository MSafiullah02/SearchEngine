Several reports have shown that many infectious diseases can be transmitted via the airborne route (Nardell et al., 1986, Mangili and Gendreau, 2005). A recent multi-disciplinary systematic review reveals that there is a strong and sufficient evidence to demonstrate the association between ventilation, airflow pattern in buildings and the spread of infectious diseases (Li et al., 2007). Besides human-generated virus laden bio-aerosols, smoke particles could increase respiratory irritation and aggravation of existing respiratory or cardiovascular disease, an asbestos fiber exposure for prolonged periods increases the risk of lung cancer, and miner aerosols may be carcinogenic or mutagenic (GN, 1999). Generally, the health hazards caused by particulate matter depend on the component, size, shape, density, and chemical reactivity of the particles.",

Because of the various sources, the indoor particle size range extends from submicron to larger than 100\u03bcm in diameters (more than 1000 times difference). This poly-disperse feature, or broad particle size spectrum, makes transport process complicated since the dynamic property is strongly related to particle size. For instance, fine submicron particles with a small relaxation time may follow almost exactly the main airstreams, acting like a tracer gas, while coarse particles with their diameter of 100\u03bcm may fall 1 m within 4 s in a still environment. The complex behavior of indoor particulate matter may include dispersion, deposition, re-suspension, coagulation, and even phase change. In order to solve the indoor air quality problems and to control the particle dispersion, understanding of the particle-laden turbulent flow is important. However, our present knowledge on turbulence limits the further exploration of the nature of interaction between turbulence and an individual particle. Therefore, it is so far still difficult to predict the indoor particle concentration when considering all mechanisms.",

            "text": "Mathematically, there are two treatments of indoor particle movements: the Euler\u2013Lagrange method and the Euler\u2013Euler method. The selection between them is based on the \u201cjob\u201d (research objective) and the \u201ccost\u201d (required computational resources) (Loth, 2000). Generally, the Lagrangian method may be comparatively memory intensive and computationally inefficient in order to ensure statistically stable results. However, the Lagrangian method is attractive if interests are in the particle dispersion history. Holmberg and Li (1998) have justified the two application requirements of the Euler\u2013Euler method in the modeling of indoor environments. These are that the particle size should be significantly smaller than the Kolmogorov microscale and that there should be enough particles in each computational cell so that the particle phase can be statistically assumed as a continuum. The Kolmogorov microscale is at the magnitude of 1 mm for a normal ventilated room (Etheridge and Sandberg, 1996), which is at least several times of indoor particle sizes. The interaction between particles and airstreams in built environments is considered as one-way coupling for saving computational load (Chen et al., 2006). It means a dilute dispersed phase flow, in which particle movements are determined by the state of the airflow. Both the transfer of momentum and heat from particles to fluids and particle\u2013particle interactions are ignored. For this treatment to be valid, the particulate loading should be low since it has a significant impact on phase interaction. For a typical indoor particle concentration in residential buildings in Hong Kong, the 24 h suspended particulate levels varied from 45.8 to 122.2\u03bcgm-3, as measured by Chao et al. (1998). It can be estimated that the corresponding L/D is of the order of 103 and \u03c4V/\u03c4C\n10-2. Thus, the one-way coupling in the modeling of indoor environment is feasible (Crowe et al., 1998).",

The drift-flux model can easily incorporate the effects of Brownian and turbulent diffusion and gravitational settling effect. The drift-flux models have been practiced before and the particle concentrations are predicted (Murakami et al., 1992, Zhao et al., 2004). The purpose of this work is to improve the wall boundary treatment in the drift-flux model with the help of one deposition model. After validation against two sets of experimental data, the new drift-flux model is applied to compare the transient occupant exposure in a mock-up terrorist attack in a ventilated room with mixing ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV), and under-floor air distribution (UFAD). The dispersion and distribution of particles generated from a heat source, which would represent an office machine, in these three types of air distribution methods are also investigated.",

            "text": "Although the amount of deposited particles is usually much smaller than that of particles exhausted by ventilation, in buildings with low air exchange rate particle deposition may constitute a major removal process (Thatcher et al., 1996). To quantify the deposition in the engineering calculation, some prediction models have been set up (Shimada et al., 1989, Nazaroff and Cass, 1989). The semi-empirical model by Lai and Nazaroff (2000) links the air velocity to the macrodeposition velocity, with no consideration given to the effect of spatial distribution of particles. This model accounts for the effects of Brownian and turbulent diffusion and gravitational settling. With the assumption that the deposition flux is one-dimensional and constant in the concentration boundary layer, and the particle eddy diffusivity equals the fluid turbulent viscosity (\u03b5p=\u03c5t), the dimensionless deposition velocity can be expressed by the following equation:(2)vd+=vs+1-exp(-vs+I)upwardsurface,vs+exp(-vs+I)-1downdardsurface,u*Iverticalsurface,where vs+=vs/u*, vd+=vd/u*, I=1/vd+=\u222br+30(\u03c5g/(\u03b5p+Dp))dy+, y+=yu*/\u03c5g, r+=(D/2)(u*/\u03bdg). In their derivation, the turbulent viscosity in the boundary layer is evaluated by the DNS results of Kim et al. (1987). This model is practical to use and has a stronger physical foundation compared with previous ones. More recently, Zhao and Wu (2006) have improved the Lai and Nazaroff's model by adding the effect of turbophoresis. The prediction accuracy is enhanced for particles larger than 1\u03bcm.",

            "text": "In the present work, the Lai and Nazaroff's model, as described by Eq. (2), is used to evaluate deposition velocities (Lai and Nazaroff, 2000). The deposition flux is defined as J=vdCcell=(Dp+\u03b5P)(dC/dy)+ivsCcell, where Ccell is the particle concentration in grid cells outside the boundary layer. In the present numerical implementation of the model, a nominal particle concentration Cwall is defined as(3)Cwall=Ccell-Ccell(vd-ivs)\u03b4y(Dp+\u03b5P)by using (Ccell-Cwall)/\u03b4y to substitute dC/dy, where i is to characterize the wall surface orientation (i=0 for a vertical surface; i=1 for an upward facing horizontal surface; i=-1 for a downward facing horizontal surface). In our simulation using Eq. (3), it is found that usually the particle concentration gradient is highest at downward facing surfaces, and lowest at upward facing surfaces. It is in line with the modeling of aerosol in a chamber by Holmberg and Li (1998). They found that the \u03b1 values were 0.9, 0.99, and 0.65 for walls, floor, and ceiling, respectively. This approximate zero-gradient of particle concentration at floor means that particle deposition at floor is mainly caused by gravitational settling, not by diffusion. For particles larger than 0.5\u03bcm, the deposition velocity is nearly the same as the settling velocity and the effect of local airflow condition (denoted by the friction velocity) can be ignored (Lai and Nazaroff, 2000). This phenomenon is also proved by the experimental work (Thatcher and Nazaroff, 1997). They found that, for micron-scale particles, gravitational settling onto upward facing surfaces dominated the overall rate of deposition. It should be noted that, as is common in all turbulence models involving the use of wall functions, the first cell size close to the wall greatly affects the simulation results. Exhibited in the current model, the Cwall value will be grid-dependent, and it is essential that the first normal grid point should be located beyond the buffer layer (y+>30). Secondly, the deposition models used by Lai and Nazaroff (2000), as well as by Zhao and Wu (2006) usually under-predict the deposition flux onto the downward facing surfaces, especially for coarse particles. Maybe deposition mechanisms, other than diffusion, gravitational settling, and turbophoresis, also play an important role. Here it demands the further development of enhanced deposition models.",

Particles were mixed into the supply air with a stable particle flow rate by a solid particle disperser. Using the Eulerian approach introduced above, both the airflow and the particle concentrations are simulated in the present study for the model validation purpose. Since the air is supplied at the ceiling level and exhausted at the floor level, one large eddy and a small recirculation zone at the left lower corner are formed (Fig. 2). Fig. 3\na shows the simulated 10\u03bcm particle concentration distribution at the center plane, and the particle concentration is normalized by the inlet concentration. A high gradient in the vertical direction is observed due to the gravitation. Particles deposit onto the floor, causing a relatively low concentration at the lower part of the room. The initial supply velocity of particles (0.225ms-1) and the effect of convection result in a higher concentration in the right half of the room. For comparison purposes, simulated concentration distribution for 1\u03bcm particles is presented in Fig. 3b, and very uniform distribution can be observed. The well-mixing assumption is acceptable for 1.0\u03bcm particles while it may not be right for 10\u03bcm particles. The concentration at the outlet opening is 0.25 for 10\u03bcm particles, and 0.96 for 1.0\u03bcm particles. Most of the 10\u03bcm particles deposits onto the floor. However, for 1.0\u03bcm particles, the deposition loss can be ignored. The simulated and measured concentration profiles for the 10\u03bcm particles are compared in Fig. 4\n.Because the airflow in this experiment was relatively simple and isothermal, a fine agreement is achieved.",

The stable concentration at the exhaust is denoted as 1.0. The numerical prediction is in accord with the experimental data. The time required to reach the stable outlet concentration is obviously dependent on the particle release location. If the particle is generated in a recirculation zone, or so called a dead zone, it can be imagined that it takes a longer time for the particles to be ventilated out of the room. Here the concept of residual life time can be employed. In a pulse emission of n particles, if the portion of the particles that can arrive at the exhaust is \u03b1 and each particle takes time ti, the particle residual life time can be defined as(4)\u03c4r=\u22111\u03b1\u00d7nti\u03b1\u00d7n.We replaced the 0.7\u03bcm particles by a tracer gas and other coarse particles (7, 14, and 21\u03bcm) and simulated the temporal development of the exhaust concentrations for comparison. The time required to arrive at the stable concentration is almost the same. Previous studies in a channel flow (Brandon and Aggarwal, 2001) and in free shear layers (Loth, 1998) have revealed that particle dispersion depends on Stokes number (St) which is the ratio of the particle response time to the characteristic time. Particles with St<0.1 behave like fluid particles, whereas those with St\u22481.0 no longer faithfully follow the trajectories of fluid particles but can still respond readily to fluid velocity fluctuations and those with St>1.0 diffuse at a much slower rate than that of a scalar field inasmuch as their inertia is too great to be significantly affected by the turbulent dispersion. The experiment by Hishida et al. (1992) confirmed that with St\u223cO(1) particle dispersion coefficients became larger than the eddy diffusivity of the fluid phase. However, since the particle turbulent diffusivity is expressed by fluid turbulent viscosity this phenomenon is not evidently captured by the present drift-flux model. In the frame of Lagrangian method, the Stokes number effect on particle dispersion and \u03c4r can be easily calculated in that each particle trajectory is simulated. These two issues will be included in our next research stage in which dispersion characteristic is investigated by large eddy simulation (LES) plus Lagrangian approach.",

For MV, an inlet diffuser with small opening was set at the upper level, and an outlet at the floor level. For the UFAD, a round swirling diffuser is mounted on the floor, which is simulated by eight small square cells, as shown in Fig. 9\n. Each cell has a different airflow direction and is in charge of one-eighth of the total supply rate. The angle between the outlet airflow and the floor is 30\u2218. This method is figured out by Kobayashi and Chen (2003) through smoke visualization. A vertical heat source beside the desk was specially designed to create different level of vertical thermal stratification.

            "text": "Particles are released from the surface of the vertical heat source. In the current study the mean deposition velocity is expressed as an area-weighted average of deposition velocities at solid surfaces. The deposition rate coefficient thus can easily be obtained by multiplying the mean deposition velocity by the surface-to-volume ratio. As to the studied room configuration the surface-to-volume ratio is 2.16m-1. The mean deposition velocities in different air distributions and at various air exchange rates are shown in Figs. 10\nand 11\n, respectively. The V-shaped deposition curve as a function of particle size is observed. Particles with diameters of 0.1 and 0.5\u03bcm have minimum deposition velocities since in this diameter range the total effects of diffusion and settling are minimal. The effect of ventilation condition on deposition velocity is particle size dependent. For particles which are larger than 0.5\u03bcm, the mean deposition velocity is independent of ventilation types and air exchange rates, i.e. vd\u2248f(\u03c1P,D). This result is expectable if we look into the present-used deposition model by Lai and Nazaroff (2000). The reason is that deposition flux onto the floor is 3\u20134 orders of magnitude higher than the total flux onto the vertical walls and ceiling and that gravitational sedimentation is the only dominant factor. That is, for particles larger than 0.5\u03bcm, deposition velocity is a function of their physical properties, i.e. density and size, which increases as the particle size increases. However, the situation is entirely different for particles smaller than 0.5\u03bcm because gravitational settling is overwhelmed by the turbulent and Brownian diffusion. For 0.01 and 0.1\u03bcm particles, the mean deposition velocity is highest in MV and lowest in DV (Fig. 10). In the mixing ventilated room, a higher air exchange rate results in a higher deposition velocity (Fig. 11). Both can be explained by a higher level of indoor air velocities in MV compared to DV and at higher ventilation rates. For these submicron particles, vd=f(\u03c1P,D,u*), and a higher friction velocity leads to a higher deposition velocity. This agrees well with the experimental measurements in a chamber (Nomura et al., 1997) and in residential houses (He et al., 2005). They found that the deposition rate coefficient increased with the air exchange rate. Through monitoring the transient particle concentrations and using the following equation(5)lnCtC0=-(a+k)tthe deposition coefficient k was determined by fitting a line to a plot of the log of Ct/C0 versus time and subtracting a from the slope.",

The time required to reach 90% of the final steady concentration is listed in the legend of Fig. 12. For 1.0\u03bcm particles, the temporal increment, like a tracer gas, is faster in UFAD, and slowest in MV, with DV in the middle. It takes 17, 19, and 23 min to reach 90% of the ultimate maximum concentration in UFAD, DV, and MV, respectively. It is obvious that these time values are dependent on the location. If the occupant's head is very close to the air supply the inhaled concentration will reach the concentration level in the supply air promptly. In the current study the occupant is seated closer to the air outlets in UFAD and DV than in MV. However, as particle size becomes larger, an interesting phenomenon is found. In MV, the 90% cut-off time is 6.3 min for 20.0\u03bcm particles, 13.2 min for 10.0\u03bcm particles, which are much less than 23 min for 1.0\u03bcm particles. In UFAD, the 90% cut-off time for 10.0\u03bcm particles is only slightly less than that for 1.0\u03bcm particles, which is 15 min. However, this cut-off time is non-sensitive to particle size in DV. We consider that high air supply velocities in UFAD, and especially in MV, make the particle movements more convection dominant than in DV.",

However, this benefit may become a disadvantage in a terrorist attack because of the shorter distance between the air outlet and the occupant, causing the fastest and highest exposure to the airborne agents among the three air distribution types. In some modern open-plan office buildings, floor-mounted air diffusers are installed in workstations for conditioning the personal environments of the office workers. Typically, the occupant has control over the air supply rate, direction, and even temperature to accommodate the individual thermal preference. These systems are variously called \u201ctask/ambient conditioning\u201d, \u201clocalized thermal distribution\u201d, and \u201cpersonalized ventilation\u201d systems (Bauman and Arens, 1996).

The indicator is the ratio of room air time scale, i.e. the reciprocal of air exchange rate, to particle's settling time. Table 2\nlists the falling times over 1 m vertical distance and their corresponding air exchange rate if this indicator is set to 1, which means that the particle settling time and the room time scale are comparable. The air exchange rates from 0.71 to 10.81 are reasonable in a naturally ventilated room and an operating room, respectively. Therefore for 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0\u03bcm particles, gravitation should be taken into account. These particles are in a transitional size range, below which gravitation can be neglected, and above which gravitation becomes dominant. It is manifested in Fig. 13, where 1.0\u03bcm particles behave approximately as a tracer gas, whereas the others not. For particles of 20\u03bcm, the simulation results indicated that the gravitational force is so strong that the inhaled concentration is less than 6.7% of the room supply concentration, i.e. 0.067\u03bcgm-3, in all ventilation types.",

Aitken et al. (1999) placed a manikin with a head and upper body only in a cuboid chamber (1m\u00d71m\u00d73m) ventilated by an upside-to-downside airflow at a velocity less than 0.1ms-1. The oral inhalability of 13\u03bcm alumina particles is 83%, 84%, and 92% at a breathing rate of 6, 10, and 20,lmin-1, respectively. Similarly, Hsu and Swift (1999) found the inhalability of 13\u03bcm alumina particles to be 73.8\u00b17.1% under oronasal breathing condition in a calm chamber whose inside dimensions are 0.9m\u00d70.9m and of height of 1.8 m. Some studies have given out empirical equations to predict inhalability as a function of particle aerodynamic diameter (Vincent et al., 1990, Kennedy and Hinds, 2002). There exist some differences between the results since inhalability, which is measured in a uniform concentration field, is also dependent on many other factors, such as the approaching air velocity, body-to-wind orientation, breathing frequency, and respiration tidal volume. For comparison, human exposure to 13\u03bcm particles in MV is simulated because a relatively uniform concentration distribution is created in MV. The average particle concentration at the breathing zone is 0.25\u03bcgm-3 and inhaled concentration is 0.20\u03bcgm-3, and thus the inhalability is 80%, which falls within the experimental range.",

With MV particle concentration is almost uniform except at the points close to the ceiling where there is a clean supply airflow. The larger the particles, the lower the mean indoor concentrations. For particles smaller than 5.0\u03bcm, human exposure is nearly equal to the outlet concentration. However for larger particles, human exposure is much less than the exhaust concentration due to the aspiration efficiency mentioned above. With DV a vertical concentration stratification is observed. It is shown that the buoyant upward airflows in a displacement ventilated room are able to bring the particles to the upper zone. Because of the heavy gravitational settling effects, this principle cannot be applied to 20\u03bcm particles. As a result, human exposure is greatly lower than that with MV for 0.1, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0\u03bcm particles, but larger for 10.0 and 20.0\u03bcm particles. As for gaseous pollutants, DV is still preferable to MV for fine particles. It so happened that a portion of 10.0 and 20.0\u03bcm particles, which are too heavy to be carried up, are locked in the breathing height, resulting in a higher exposure in DV. With UFAD the vertical stratification for 0.1, 1.0, and 2.5\u03bcm particle also appears and human exposure is lower than that with MV, but slightly higher than that with DV. But owing to the weak carry-up effect, particles larger than 5.0\u03bcm are unable to be entrained to the upper level.",

It is easy to understand that in MV a strong jet flow with a high momentum causes a full mixing of indoor air. In comparison to DV where supply air is delivered at low velocities, UFAD systems deliver air through floor diffusers at higher velocities. In order to reduce the local drafts at low levels, floor air outlets are designed to maximize air mixing within the occupied zone, which diminishes the ventilation performance compared to DV systems. This is why the concentration closely above the floor in DV (see Fig. 14b) is almost zero while this is not the case with UFAD. With UFAD systems, the thermal plumes generated from heat sources are a minor, secondary characteristic of the system, with the primary air motion in the occupied zone created by the high velocity floor diffuser (McDonell, 2003). However, DV systems are designed to minimize the mixing of air in the occupied zone, and thermal plumes are the dominant air movement characteristic. Room air is displaced out at a higher portion of the space by a continual supply of fresh air. As shown by Fig. 14(d), a steeper vertical temperature gradient is formed with DV than with UFAD, and the temperatures of air close to the floor is higher with UFAD, since swirling diffuser is characterized by a swirling discharge airflow pattern that is intended to produce high induction and limited throws (Webster et al., 2002). This steeper temperature gradient induces a stronger carry-up effect in DV.",

For supermicron particles, the ventilation type and air exchange rate have an ignorable effect on deposition rate coefficient. The movements of submicron particles are like tracer gases, whereas the gravitational effect should be taken into account for particles larger than 2.5\u03bcm. Human exposure to the particulate matters released into the supply air decreases as particle size increase due to the enhancement of deposition, and this exposure is also determined by the relative locations of the occupant and the air outlet. UFAD systems, which are reported to be able to improve ventilation effectiveness, would become the most vulnerable systems in a terrorist attack in the form of releasing biochemical aerosols in ventilation ducts, in terms of the shortest response time the occupants would have. With particle sources located within an internal heat source, desirable vertical concentration stratification appears in DV and UFAD for particles up to 10.0\u03bcm.
