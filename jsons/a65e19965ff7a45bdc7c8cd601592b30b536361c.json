China's population in 2010 represented 19% of the world's total population. The population rose by 73,899,804 (or 5\u00b784%) since the census in 2000. There were 665,575,306 urban residents, accounting for 49\u00b768% of the population; compared to the 2000 census, the proportion of urban residents rose by 13\u00b746% (reflecting the increasing migration from the countryside to towns and cities since the economy was opened up in the late 1970s).

From 1988 peasant couples were permitted a second child after four years if the first born was a girl, a measure to combat infanticide. In 1999 China started to implement a more widespread gradual relaxation of the one-child policy. In Dec. 2013 the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) approved a resolution allowing couples to have two children if either parent was an only child. The one-child policy was formally abandoned altogether from 1 Jan. 2016.",

Mandarin in one form or another is spoken by 885m. people in China, or around 70% of the population of mainland China. The Wu language and its dialects has some 77m. native speakers and Cantonese 66m. Around 400m. people in China cannot speak Mandarin. The ideographic writing system of 'characters' is uniform throughout the country, and has undergone systematic simplification. In 1958 a phonetic alphabet (Pinyin) was devised to transcribe the characters, and in 1979 this was officially adopted for use in all texts in the Roman alphabet. The previous transcription scheme (Wade) is still used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Mainland China is administratively divided into 22 provinces, five autonomous regions (originally entirely or largely inhabited by ethnic minorities, though in some regions now outnumbered by Han immigrants) and four government-controlled municipalities. These are in turn divided into 332 prefectures, 658 cities (of which 265 are at prefecture level and 393 at county level), 2,053 counties and 808 urban districts.

China also holds the world's largest foreign exchange reserves, at more than US$3trn. in Jan. 2016, although they have been falling since 2014 as the central bank strives to boost the currency in the face of large capital outflows. It is among the top recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) and is the world's largest producer and consumer of coal. In 2005 China made the transition from net receiver of foreign aid to net donor and has established itself as a key player in Africa's economic development, becoming the largest export partner of sub-Saharan Africa in 2013. According to the World Bank, China's cumulative FDI stock in Africa nearly totalled US$34\u00b77bn. in 2015, up from US$14\u00b77bn. in 2011. In Feb. 2011 China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy after the USA. The first steps from a centrally-planned towards a more market-oriented economy were taken by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s. He opened the economy to foreign trade and investment, decentralized industrial management and allowed private sector development. In 2001 China became a member of the World Trade Organization, establishing trade relations with many countries. Private entrepreneurs and foreign investors have played an important role in developing the manufacturing sector, China's principal growth engine. Even before 1978 the economy was heavily skewed towards manufacturing, but following the market-oriented transition output increased significantly. During this period there was a structural shift away from large stateowned enterprises (SOEs), although these still remain an important part of the economy. Between 1997 and 2003 the government oversaw reform of SOEs, with many poorly performing businesses privatized or liquidated. Stronger firms were restructured and often listed on the stock market. Many more recent enterprises are labour-intensive as distinct from the capital-intensive SOEs. Growth has been fuelled by low added value and labour-intensive exports. However, Chinese firms are predicted to become increasingly competitive with higher added value producers, such as South Korea.",

The yuan was floated to reflect market forces on 1 Jan. 1994 while remaining state-controlled. For 11 years the People's Bank of China maintained the yuan at about 8\u00b728 to the US dollar, allowing it to fluctuate but only by a fraction of 1% in closely supervised trading. In July 2005 it was revalued and pegged against a 'market basket' of currencies the central parities of which were determined every night. In July 2008, after three years of sharp appreciation, it was repegged at around 6\u00b783 yuan to the dollar, leading to claims from some international observers that it was being kept unfairly low to boost exports. In June 2010 the government announced that the yuan would be allowed to move freely against the dollar as long as a rise or fall does not exceed 0\u00b75% within a single day. In Aug. 2015 the yuan was devalued by a total of 4\u00b765% on three consecutive days.

There were 20 directly elected seats out of 60 for the first elections to the Legislative Council following Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty, increasing in accordance with the Basic Law to 24 for the 2000 election with 36 indirectly elected. In the Sept. 2004 Legislative Council election (and that of Sept. 2008) 30 of the 60 seats were directly elected. For the election in Sept. 2012 the number of seats was increased to 70, with 35 directly elected and 30 indirectly elected by functional constituencies. There were also five new functional constituency seats nominated by elected District Council members. The Chief Executive is chosen by a Beijing-backed 1,200-member election committee (800 prior to the March 2012 election), although it has been stated that universal suffrage is the ultimate aim. In 2007 a timetable was announced for Hong Kong to directly elect its Chief Executive in 2017 and its Legislative Council in 2020. However, Beijing insisted that only approved candidates would be allowed to stand in 2017, prompting mass pro-democracy rallies in the territory in 2014 and formal rejection of the plan by the Legislative Council in June 2015. Beijing nevertheless refused to countenance amendments.",

The borders were opened for trade with neighbouring countries in 1980. In 1984 a Buddhist seminary opened in Lhasa, the regional capital, with 200 students, and monasteries and shrines have since been renovated and reopened. There were some 46,000 monks and nuns in 2013. In 1988 Tibetan was reinstated as a 'major official language', competence in which is required of all administrative officials. In 1998 the then Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, said he was prepared to meet the Dalai Lama provided he acknowledged Chinese sovereignty over Tibet and Taiwan. In Sept. 2002 direct contact between the exiled government and China was re-established after a nine-year gap. However, in March 2008 anti-Chinese protests in Lhasa ended in violence, with dozens reportedly killed by the Chinese authorities, and in Oct. that year the Dalai Lama stated he had lost hope of reaching agreement with China on Tibet's status. In April 2011 he announced his retirement from active politics in favour of Lobsang Sangay, who had been elected to lead the Tibetan government-in-exile. In July 2011, shortly after US President Obama had received the Dalai Lama in Washington, China's soon-to-be president, Xi Jinping, pledged to 'smash' attempts to destabilize Tibet. By Feb. 2013 there had been over 100 reported cases of self-immolation by Tibetans protesting against Chinese rule.The estimated population of Tibet at the end of 2012 had risen to 3\u00b708m. from 3\u00b700m. at the 2010 census.

KEY HISTORICAL EVENTS Macao was visited by Portuguese traders from 1513 and became a Portuguese colony in 1557. Initially sovereignty remained vested in China, with the Portuguese paying an annual rent. In 1848-49 the Portuguese declared Macao a free port and established jurisdiction over the territory. On 6 Jan. 1987 Portugal agreed to return Macao to China on 20 Dec. 1999 when it would become a special administrative zone of China, with considerable autonomy. TERRITORY AND POPULATION The Macao Special Administrative Region, which lies at the mouth of the Pearl River, comprises a peninsula (9\u00b73 sq. km) connected by a narrow isthmus to the People's Republic of China, on which is built the city of Santa Nome de Deus de Macao, the islands of Taipa (7\u00b76 sq. km), linked to Macao by three bridges, Col\u00f4ane (7\u00b76 sq. km) linked to Taipa by a 2-km causeway, and Cotai, a strip of reclaimed land between Col\u00f4ane and Taipa (5\u00b79 km). The total area of Macao in 2015 was 30\u00b74 sq. km. Additional land continues to be reclaimed from the sea. The population at the 2011 census was 552,503 (287,359 females); density, 18,478 people per sq. km. The provisional census population in 2016 was 650,900. According to UN estimates, the entire population lived in urban areas in 2011. The official languages are Chinese and Portuguese, with the majority speaking the Cantonese dialect. Only about 4,000 people speak Portuguese as their first language. 784 foreigners were legally registered for residency in Macao. There were 8,468 legal immigrants from mainland China. CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT Macao's constitution is the 'Basic Law', promulgated by China's National People's Congress on 31 March 1993 and in effect since 20 Dec. 1999. It is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China, and is directly under the Central People's Government while enjoying a high degree of autonomy.

After the Second World War the island was surrendered to Gen. Chiang Kai-shek who made it the headquarters for his crumbling Nationalist Government. Until 1970 the USA supported Taiwan's claims to represent all of China. Only in 1971 did the government of the People's Republic of China manage to replace that of Chiang Kai-shek at the UN. In Jan. 1979 the USA established formal diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, breaking off formal ties with Taiwan. Taiwan itself has continued to reject attempts at reunification, and although there have been frequent threats of direct action from mainland China (including military manoeuvres off the Taiwanese coast) the prospect of confrontation with the USA supports the status quo.In July 1999 President Lee Teng-hui repudiated Taiwan's 50year-old 'One China' policy-the pretence of a common goal of unification-arguing that Taiwan and China should maintain equal 'state to state' relations. This was a rejection of Beijing's view that Taiwan is no more than a renegade Chinese province which must be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary. In the presidential election of 18 March 2000 Chen Shui-bian, leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, was elected, together with Annette Lu Hsiu-lien as his Vice President. Both supported independence although Chen Shui-bian made friendly gestures towards China and distanced himself from colleagues who wanted an immediate declaration of independence. Following his wife's indictment on embezzlement charges in Nov. 2006, President Chen survived three parliamentary attempts to impeach him. He was succeeded as president in 2008 by Ma Ying-jeou of the Nationalist Party.",
