Infection of pregnant animals with noncytopathogenic BVDV during the first trimester may cause abortion, stillborn, or persistently infected claves (Mahony et al., 2005). Noncytopathogenic BVDV may spontaneously mutate to the cytopathogenic biotype, resulting in the onset of fatal mucosal disease (Meyers et al., 1991).

            "text": "Identification of persistently infected calves, in combination with a proper vaccination program, is essential to the successful control of BVDV. The currently available diagnostic methods for BVDV include virus isolation, immunoassay, electron microscopy (EM), nuclei acid hybridization, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Deregt et al., 2002, Ridpath et al., 2002, Fulton et al., 2006, Youssef, 2006). Although RT-PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test for detecting BVDV RNA, it has the intrinsic disadvantage of requiring a high-precision instrument such as a thermocycler for amplification and a time-consuming and complicated detection method (gel electrophoresis unit). In recent years, many studies have demonstrated the potential application of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP assay for rapid detection of viral DNA or RNA (Parida et al., 2004, Enomoto et al., 2005, Cho et al., 2006, Chen et al., 2008, Komiyama et al., 2009, Rovira et al., 2009, Fan et al., 2010, Yin et al., 2010). Like RT-PCR, the RT-LAMP technique amplifies the target viral RNA sequence (Notomi et al., 2000). In this study, a RT-LAMP assay for detection of BVDV RNA is developed. Since the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR) of BVDV is among the most conserved regions and has been chosen as a preferred target region for detection of BVDV RNA by RT-PCR (Letellier et al., 1999, Fan et al., 2010), a set of six primers was designed to amplify 6 target sequences at the 5\u2032UTR of the BVDV genome for the RT-LAMP assay.",

The BVDV reference virus strains were propagated in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Shijiqing, China, free of BVDV and antibody to BVDV). Thirteen field isolates were isolated from calves with typical BVDV clinical signs such as diarrhea, miscarriages and stillborn. For virus isolation, a total of 1 g of fresh aseptically collected liver tissues was homogenized in 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). A 1:10 dilution of the supernatants was then inoculated onto MDBK monolayer cultures and incubated for 6 days. The presence or absence of cytopathic effect was recorded. After 3 times of freezing and thawing, culture supernatants were collected after centrifugation and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C for further characterization with indirect immunoperoxidase (IPX) test and electron microscopy (EM). All 13 field isolates were BVDV positive as revealed by both positive IPX staining and the typical BVDV morphology (40\u201360 nm in diameter) under an electron microscope.",

The 5\u2032UTR of BVDV, which is sufficiently conserved among the randomly selected BVDV isolates, was chosen for primer design. Primer Explored V4 software was used to design the RT-LAMP primers (http://primerexplorer.jp/e/). The two outer primers are known as the forward outer primer (F3) and the backward outer primer (B3), which helps in strand displacement. The inner primers are known as the forward inner primer (FIP) and the backward inner primer (BIP), respectively. Each inner primer has two distinct sequences corresponding to the sense and antisense sequences of the target, one for priming during the early stage and the other for self-priming during late stage of LAMP. FIP contains F1C (complementary to F1) and F2 sequence. BIP contains the B1C sequence (complementary to B1) and B2 sequence. Both FIP and BIP were high-performance liquid chromatography purified. FIP and BIP contained 3 R(C+G) and 1 Y(A+T) to facilitate the amplification of both BVDV1 and BVDV2 (Table 2\nand Fig. 1\n). All primers were synthesized by Invitrogen (GuangZhou, China).

            "text": "RT-LAMP has been used in detecting viral RNA molecules due to its simplicity and high sensitivity for a number of viruses including avian influenza virus, classical swine fever virus, West Nile virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Parida et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2010, Rovira et al., 2009). In this study, an RT-LAMP method was developed for detection of both BVDV1 and BVDV2. The RT-LAMP method exhibited the same sensitivity as real-time RT-PCR and did not detect classical swine fever virus and other bovine viruses. Similarly, an RT-RAMP method for classical swine fever virus did not detect BVDV (Chen et al., 2010), suggesting the specificity of each RT-LAMP assay. Twenty-one BVDV1 isolates and 17 BVDV2 isolates were selected at random from the GenBank database and the sequence homology in the 5\u2032UTR region upon which the RT-LAMP primers were designed was analyzed. It is estimated that the RT-LAMP would detect 95% of BVDV1 and 70.6% of BVDV2. The lower detection rate for BVDV2 is primarily due to the higher genetic variations observed in the 5\u2032UTR of BVDV2 compared to BVDV1 isolates. All 39 BVDV positive samples confirmed by real-time RT-PCR were clustered within the BVDV1 genotype as revealed by DNA sequence analysis of the 102 bp PCR product (Fig. 3). The RT-LAMP method will be particularly useful in detecting BVDV from cattle herds in China since BVDV1 is the major type of BVDV circulating in the cattle herds (Li et al., 1983, Xue et al., 2010). BVDV2 was first isolated from cattle in China in 2010 (Xie et al., 2011). Due to the inherent genetic heterogeneity of BVDV, it remains to be a challenge to develop a universal molecular test that is capable of detecting all BVDV isolates.",

There were 8 fecal samples positive by RT-LAMP and real-time RT-PCR but negative by RT-PCR. It is possible that the 8 fecal samples may have had few viral RNA molecules, which were below the detection limit of RT-PCR analysis. It is interesting to note that the primers for RT-PCR (100\u2013342 nt), real-time RT-PCR (104\u2013205 nt), and RT-RAMP (97\u2013470 nt) described in the study detected the same 5\u2032UTR region of BVDV Oregon CV24 (GenBank accession # AF0911605.1).",

The false positive results associated with contamination can be avoided by adding SYBR green I directly to the reaction mixture.",
