The operations of the healthcare system remain functional, including adequate hospital capacity, medication availability, and staffing. While there is no scarcity, resources need to be reallocated. Organ donation may decline. Risks include underutilization of available resources, and transmission of infection to patients or health care workers (HCW). The Overwhelmed stage. In this stage, the number of patients with COVID-19 exceeds hospital capacity, with a large proportion of critically ill patients. Rationing of medical resources, such as critical care capacity, staff or personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary. Organ donation is severely reduced. The number of HCWs absent due to infection, quarantine, or burn-out is substantial. Risks include inadequate care for infected patients, but also inefficient allocation of scarce resources between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, with high morbidity and mortality in both groups. There is substantial risk of infection, exhaustion, and psychological trauma to HCW. The Recovery stage. In this stage, the number of admissions for COVID-19 is decreasing, but secondary waves may occur. Normal activity may gradually resume. Resource availability is unpredictable. Augmented measures to prevent disease transmission are still needed. Risks include inefficient use of available resources, and increased infection risks to patients and HCW due to premature loosening of infection control practices. The New Normal stage. This is after the pandemic. Many hospital and outpatient clinic routines may have changed. Episodic bursts of local epidemics may still occur, resulting in periodic need to reduce elective procedures, patient or HCW travel activity, or in other intermittent resource restrictions. Overall hospital resource availability may be permanently changed as a result of the pandemic. Lessons learned during the pandemic may alter the healthcare work-flow measurably and permanently in many cases. Considering how the various stages of the pandemic might look from the health care institution perspective and weighing the practical and ethical factors that characterize thoracic transplant and MCS, we have created a table that outlines the risks and opportunities in each stage (",

            "text": "(7,8) A recent publication suggests several points to consider in the current pandemic as detailed below.(5)Maximizing treatment benefit: utility during the pandemicThe primary goal of resource allocation under crisis standards of care is to maximize the total number of lives saved. During the COVID-19 pandemic, even absent restrictions on resources, it is not clear how individual patients will be affected. For instance, the effects of COVID-19 on the overall survival of waitlisted or post-transplant patients is unclear.(9, 10) Risk differences may be mediated by COVID-19 itself, changes in access to medical treatment, or reduction in risk of acquiring other infections as a result of stringent social distancing. It is, therefore, not certain that criteria determining transplant urgency before the pandemic apply during the current pandemic.Data from Europe demonstrate reduction in organ donation rates during the pandemic.(11) This may increase the expected benefit of durable MCS and of conservative treatment modalities (such as inotropic therapy) as compared to listing for transplant. Recommendation: A commitment to maximize overall utility while preserving fair allocation of donor organs requires reconsideration of existing prioritization calculations among patients with advanced heart and lung disease. This reconsideration should be continuously adjusted to the changing conditions during the pandemic. Consideration of age during the pandemic Guidance documents for resource prioritization during a pandemic recommend a commitment to maximize the number of life years saved as a secondary goal beyond simply saving the most lives.(5, 12, 13) This justice-related consideration, characterized as the \"fair innings\" principle,(14) has been operationalized as a tie-breaker when considering two people who are equally likely to survive given access to critical care resources. Thus, age (and life years saved) may become an additional factor when rationing scarce critical care resources (such as ventilators) during the current pandemic.(15) Although this has not been the usual practice at most transplant centers, preference to younger patients might be one principle that transplant or MCS clinicians must consider during the severe rationing of resources in the Overwhelmed stage. Recommendation: To ensure just distribution of scarce resources and to avoid additional burden on front-line clinicians during the Overwhelmed stage, the controversial issue of patient age and life years saved, as criterion for prioritization should be discussed in advance, and local guidelines should be specified and communicated. Efficiency of thoracic transplantation/MCS during the pandemic The expected resource needs of individual patients have not traditionally been given weight in the selection or allocation for transplantation or MCS, at least not explicitly, although some variation between centers may occur. An example of such variation is the varying tendency to give priority to transplant candidates who are treated with Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO).(16) During the pandemic, however, considerations of efficiency may carry considerable weight, depending on local resources during the various stages of the pandemic. For instance, if critical care capacity is scarce, a patient considered in urgent need for transplant or MCS, but will likely have a complicated post-transplant course may not be given priority. Similarly, while MCS implants in ambulatory, non-inotrope dependent patients and even stable inotrope-dependent patients may be safely deferred, the resource need of patients with unstable disease severity should be considered in the interest of an overall efficient use of limited resources.(17) Thus, patients who may be predicted to have lesser likelihood of requiring limited resources (such as ECMO or dialysis) may be given priority. Conversely, if a patient in critical care is transplanted or receives MCS, it may liberate resources and be counted as a benefit.Recommendation: Estimating the resource need for each individual patient is necessary to devise a plan for a balanced allocation or for a reduction of transplant or MCS activity during resource scarcity.",

            "text": "in different countries.(1, 18) As the pandemic progresses, all travel between health care institutions carries risk for the HCW of acquiring or spreading infection, especially if PPE supply is limited. Strategies to minimize exposure should be implemented, but depending on the stage of the pandemic, organ procurement may still involve risk of contagion, especially as lung retrieval and transplant is considered an aerosol generating procedure. It is important to consider this when considering a donor offer. Furthermore, the highly specialized nature of thoracic transplant and MCS means that some HCW are difficult to replace in case of infection or quarantine. This may have significant collateral consequences for other patients and should be considered under a commitment to maximize overall benefit of resource expenditure. In particular, many transplant surgeons are also responsible for ECMO and other advanced life-sustaining therapies required to support patients with COVID-19 and should be protected from non-essential disease exposures. Another risk to HCW is the emotional stress in the Overwhelmed stage. To unburden HCWs, the establishment of triage officers and triage teams has been suggested,(5) but this may not always be feasible. Recommendation: Strategies for prioritization of organs for transplant and of other resources should consider the effects on HCWs, including risk of infection and emotional stress. Such strategies should be developed before the Overwhelmed stage, ideally in the Anticipation stage, and then continuously adapted to the evolving situation. The support of an ethics committee should be considered.",

Pediatric thoracic transplant during the pandemic Children appear to be at lower risk for COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality compared to adults.(25) The prioritization of healthcare resources to adults over children must be done with caution to preserve resources needed for pediatric patients, particularly keeping in mind that pediatric transplant programs are typically smaller than their adult counterparts. For transplant, survival benefit algorithms are not well established in pediatric patients, particularly infants and children under 12 years of age.(26) Moreover, illness severity score prediction models that may be used to allocate resources to critically ill COVID-19 patients are not validated for children. Thus, there is a lack of data regarding both benefit and urgency measures in pediatric transplant. However, neither the risks to the HCW nor the challenges in resource use are changed in this circumstance. Recommendation: Reallocation of resources to serve the increased needs of the adult population needs to be done carefully to ensure resources and staff critical for provision of pediatric transplant or MCS services remain available.",
