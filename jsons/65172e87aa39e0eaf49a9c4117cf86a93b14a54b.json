The envelope and membrane gene segments were the most conserved and had a 100% nt identity, and the nonstructural (NS) 6 accessory gene had the lowest nucleotide identity (98.9%-100%) within the US strains. Compared with segments of the China strains, the envelope gene segment was the most conserved (99.6% nt identity), and the spike gene segment was the most diverse (98.5%-98.8% nt identity). The China PDCoV strain HKU15-155 contained two 3-nt deletions in the spike gene and 3\u2032 untranslated region; the China strain HKU15 44 and US strains lacked this deletion. Inversely, PDCoV China strain HKU15-44 contained a nucleotide deletion in the 3\u2032 untranslated region that was not present in the US PDCoV strains.",

Identification of PDCoV in 30% of samples tested indicates that PDCoV is a common viral pathogen of pigs in the midwestern United States. We identified positive PD-CoV in 20 (22%) samples that were negative for TGEV, PEDV, RVA, RVB, and RVC, but PDCoV co-infections were more common (69 [78%] samples), especially with RVC (52 [58%]). Although the samples from Canada were negative for PDCoV, the Animal Health Laboratory has confirmed that 6 Ontario farms contain PDCoV. Because we selected samples on the basis of clinical diarrhea and geographic location was limited, the results do not accurately reflect the prevalence of PDCoV in North America. In addition, the presence of PDCoV RNA in feed does not indicate infectivity of the virus. The prevalence of PDCoV in North America is unknown, and the new PDCoV rRT-PCR can be used to access the prevalence in the United States and Canada.",

Because the sequenced PDCoV samples were from a similar geographic location, the 99.9%-100% nt identity does not correlate with the possible genetic diversity within the United States. An alternate hypothesis would indicate that PDCoV has been an undiagnosed pathogen of pigs in the United States and, like RVB, has been circulating there for an extended period (6) or that PDCoV might be a secondary infection to other enteric pathogens. PDCoV pathogenesis and retrospective surveillance studies are needed to answer these epidemiologic questions in the United States and to determine PDCoV prevalence worldwide.",
