            "text": "Proteases are enzymes that hydrolyze peptide bonds within endogenous substrates and peptides. They play a key role in regulating many physiological conditions, and protease activity is dysregulated in many diseases, including cancer, diabetes and neurological disorders 1, 2. To date, five major families of proteases have been described: serine, cysteine, metallo\u2010, aspartyl and threonine proteases (Fig. 1). The most abundant and explored families are the serine and cysteine proteases, named after the reactive nucleophilic groups in their active sites \u2013 the hydroxyl group in serine and thiol group in cysteine 3. Mechanistically, proteases hydrolyze peptide bonds in the substrate (endopeptidases) or at the N or C termini (exopeptidases) 3. Proteinases belonging to the same family, such as caspases, neutrophil serine proteases, aminopeptidases, cathepsins or kallikreins, typically have similar functions and process the same naturally occurring substrates. However, little is known about the individual physiological and pathophysiological functions of some proteases 4, 5, 6, 7. To answer these questions, chemical tools including substrates, inhibitors and activity\u2010based probes (ABPs) have become essential for monitoring changes in the activity of proteolytic enzymes in cells or even in whole organisms (Fig. 2) 8, 9, 10.",

This cross\u2010reactivity of substrates, inhibitors and ABPs with other enzymes significantly impairs or even prevents investigations of a target protease 4.

            "text": "The first broad chemical approach to study protease substrate specificity was proposed by Thornberry and colleagues in 1997 16, 17. In this concept, the PS\u2010SCL (Fig. 3), the substrate library comprises three \u2018sublibraries\u2019 to study protease preferences at the P4, P3 and P2 positions. For instance, in the P4 sublibrary, this position was fixed with one of the natural amino acids (1\u201319), the P3\u2013P2 positions were randomized with equimolar mixtures of natural amino acids (making this library useful to study various caspases), and the P1\u2013P1\u2032 positions were occupied by Asp\u20137\u2010amino\u20104\u2010methyl\u2010coumarin (AMC). The caspase specificity preferences in the active site pockets were obtained by screening each position separately, making this approach \u2018positional profiling\u2019. Shortly after, the Ellman and Craik groups utilized a bifunctional 7\u2010amino\u20104\u2010carbamoylmethylcoumarin (ACC) fluorophore as a reporter group in PS\u2010SCL, making introducing various amino acids at the P1 position much more effortless 18. To date, over 100 proteases have been profiled with the PS\u2010SCL approach, ranking this technology among the most useful tools in protease substrate specificity investigations 8. However, traditional PS\u2010SCL has been demonstrated to be insufficient when analyzing proteases with overlapping substrate specificity profiles (e.g. caspases, cysteine cathepsins, neutrophil proteases and deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs)). The use of only natural amino acids in a PS\u2010SCL reduces the chance of finding a specific (and/or very active) peptide toward the protease of interest. This drawback was overcome by a novel approach developed in the Drag laboratory 19. This concept, the HyCoSuL, relies on the use of a broad panel of unnatural amino acids in the substrate sequences, which explore the protease active site much more accurately than a set of 20 natural analogues alone (Fig. 3). The use of unnatural amino acids in fluorogenic substrate libraries was also applied in the CoSeSuL 12. This approach is restricted to proteases that display very broad substrate specificity in one (or more) active site pockets. By comparing such a specificity matrix with other proteases displaying narrower specificity in corresponding pocket(s), it becomes possible to distinguish between enzymes. PS\u2010SCL, HyCoSuL and CoSeSuL are valuable tools to study protease substrate specificities; however, they are all limited to the non\u2010prime pockets of the enzyme active site. IQF substrates offer an excellent platform to study protease preferences in both prime and non\u2010prime regions (Fig. 4) 20. In brief, IQF substrates are peptides of various lengths flanked by a fluorescence group (donor) and a quencher group (acceptor). Such intact peptides are in a quenched state, as the fluorescence from the donor is quenched by an appropriate acceptor. Once the peptide is cleaved by the protease, the peptide fragment with the fluorophore is separated from the quencher, and the fluorescence is liberated. Currently, there is no single, unified technology using IQF substrates in protease screenings, and the architecture of an IQF substrate library is tailored to the protease being investigated. To date, various donor\u2013acceptor pairs have been described in the literature and are reviewed elsewhere 8.",

            "text": "As an alternative to chemical\u2010based approaches, a phage display technology of biological origins has also been extensively developed and studied on proteolytic enzymes. This methodology was pioneered by Smith, who expressed a diverse pool of peptides on the surface of bacteriophage M13 21. This technique was initially oriented to studying protein\u2013protein interactions; however, it was later modified and adapted for protease substrate specificity profiling (Fig. 3) 22. The main advantage of phage display is the generation of a very large and diverse pool of substrates (up to 1010 individual peptides), which would be very challenging through chemical synthesis. Another important feature of this technique is that these peptides are subjected to protease analysis after each round of expression/selection; thus, in subsequent cycles, peptides of increasing quality are generated. One of the main drawbacks of these methods is that the peptides are label\u2010free. Therefore, the kinetic analysis of the best substrates requires these peptides to be resynthesized with an appropriate reporter group. Since Matthews and Wells first described the use of phage display in protease screening, multiple enzymes have been profiled with this technique 23.",

The NSP family includes neutrophil elastase (NE), cathepsin G (CatG), proteinase 3 (PR3) and neutrophil serine proteinase 4 (NSP4) 24, 25, 26. Among others, these enzymes are involved in killing bacteria via the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps 27, 28. NSPs evolved from a common ancestor by gene duplication, and they reveal a new branch of the chymotrypsinogen superfamily of serine proteases 29. NSPs consist of five exons and four introns. Along with the genes for NE and PR3, the NSP4 gene lies on chromosome 19p13.3 outside of the ZU1\u2010PRTN3\u2010ELANE\u2010CFD cluster 30, 31, 32, while CatG is located on chromosome 14q11.2 33. Regarding primary structure, the amino acid residues that determine the substrate recognition sites for NSPs are quite similar, and catalytic residues and substrate\u2010binding pockets are located in a crevice between two \u03b2\u2010barrels 32. Therefore, these enzymes share similar catalytic preferences and recognize the same endogenous inhibitors belonging to the serpin (serine protease inhibitors) family, such as antitrypsin or \u03b1\u20101 proteinase inhibitor and human monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor, which inhibit PR3, NE and CatG 34, 35.",

In this method, a rapid multiplex substrate profiling analysis using liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry sequencing was applied to profile the substrates of neutrophil serine proteases in human neutrophil extracellular traps. The obtained data clearly showed that each enzyme had overlapping, yet distinct, endopeptidase activities, suggesting overlapping functions and substrate preferences between neutrophil serine proteases 24.",

This technology allows researchers to explore the P4\u2013P2 binding sites in various structures. Surprisingly, in contrast to previously known NE substrates with sequence Ac\u2010AAPV\u2010AMC (Fig. 5), the HyCoSuL P4 screen identified the bulky 2\u2010amino\u20106\u2010benzyloxyhexanoic acid (Nle(O\u2010Bzl)) residue. This result was confirmed later by Lechtenberg, who presented a crystal structure of an NE ABP containing Nle(O\u2010Bzl) at the P4 position 39 and demonstrated the fit of unnatural amino acids in the enzyme pockets in the active site. Moreover, methionine sulfone (Met(O)2) was identified at the S3 site, which suggested a potential post\u2010translational modification of natural NE substrates. Not surprisingly, both NE (octahydroindole\u20102\u2010carboxylic acid, Oic) and PR3 prefer proline derivatives at the P2 position 19. Crucially, a comparison of the k\ncat/K\nm values for the synthesized substrate against both NE and PR3 showed that the Ac\u2010Nle(O\u2010Bzl)\u2010Met(O)2\u2010Oic\u2010Abu\u2010ACC (Fig. 5) substrate is approximately 900\u2010fold more specific for NE compared with PR3, exhibiting a relatively small K\nm of 0.28 \u03bcm for NE. An ABP for neutrophil elastase based on the optimal NE sequence was then used in in vitro studies, allowing researchers to discriminate between NE and PR3 and monitor the activity of neutrophil elastase in neutrophil traps for the first time 19.",

Using this technology, specific NSP4 substrates and ABPs were synthesized and tested in in vitro assays. NSP4 recognized large hydrophobic residues at the P4 position (homocyclohexylalanine), large basic residues at the P3 (4\u2010guanidynophenylalanine) and the proline derivative Oic at the P2 position (Fig. 5). The most successful substrate was potent (k\ncat/K\nm 32 000 m\n\u22121\u00b7s\u22121) and approximately 70\u2010fold more specific for NSP4 compared with CatG.

They are closely related proteases with a nucleophilic serine residue stabilized by histidine and aspartic acid at the enzyme's active site and are expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Those proteases are packed into cytoplasmic granules, and similarly to NSPs, they are secreted during stimulation. In humans, five Grs are distinguished (A, B, H, K and M) 48. However, granzyme genes were found on three chromosomes in three clusters (GrA, GrB and GrM clusters). The GrA cluster on chromosome 5 includes GrA 48, 49 and GrK; the GrB cluster on chromosome 14 includes GrB and GrH 50; and the GrM cluster on chromosome 19 includes GrM 51. Grs share distinctive structural features, such as the presence of a signal peptide and pro\u2010dipeptide, which are removed during activation. Although there are subtle differences in the crystal structures of Grs, their detection remains challenging because of the similarities between them. For instance, anti\u2010GrB binds both GrA and GrH. This problem is magnified since it was shown that Grs recognize and cleave the same natural substrates; for instance, 80 GrA substrates are reported to be GrB substrates as well, and among them, 22 have the same cleavage site 52. To date, no specific tool to distinguish between active and inactive Grs has been found; however, a few elegant approaches have been published and are discussed in this review.",

The amino acids near the scissile bond of the reactive center loop were modified in another approach by extracting structural fragments to obtain specific recombinant hK2 70 and hK14 71 inhibitors. In these approaches, phage display methodology was used to select peptide sequences for hK2 (six variants) and hK14 (two variants). hK14 has a dual (chymo)trypsin\u2010like substrate specificity, and Felber et al. described four variants of recombinant mutant serpins (two variants for serpin): \u03b1\u20101\u2010antitrypsin (AAT) and antichymotrypsin (ACT). In both ACT and AAT, five residues surrounding the scissile bond were replaced with a pentapeptide sequence that was previously obtained using phage display 72. Specificity was tested against enzymes with a broad range of specificity, such as elastase, chymotrypsin, trypsin, plasma kallikreins and thrombin, and then tested against enzymes belonging to the same family, i.e. hK2, hK3, hK5, hK6, hK8 and hK13.

            "text": "Caspases are cysteine proteases that display very narrow preferences at the P1 position, primarily recognizing aspartic acid (with some exceptions) 73. Such primary specificity is quite rare among proteases. However, Wells and colleagues have recently shown that these enzymes can also cleave substrates after glutamic acid and phosphoserine residues, shedding new light on their physiological functions 74. Since the discovery and characterization of caspases 20 years ago, hundreds of papers have been published on their substrates and inhibitors 9, 75. Unfortunately, their exclusive specificity for Asp at the P1 position makes it very difficult to distinguish these enzymes 76. Using PS\u2010SCL as a tool, Thornberry and colleagues determined the substrate preferences of the S4\u2013S2 pockets of nine human caspases 17. Based on these profiles, caspases were divided into three groups: caspase\u20101, \u20104 and \u20105, which prefer the (W/L)EHD sequence, caspase\u20103, \u20107 and \u20102, which recognize DE(V/H)D peptides, and caspase\u20106, \u20108 and \u20109, which favor (V/L)EHD motifs. Nevertheless, the specificity matrix clearly shows that these proteases display overlapping substrate specificity, and the \u2018optimal sequences\u2019 proposed by the authors may not be specific for only one enzyme. Indeed, later work by other groups has shown that short inherent substrates containing tetrapeptide motifs display cross\u2010reactivity among the caspases, making it very difficult to use these substrates in cell extracts that contain different concentrations of several caspases 4, 77. In another approach to design caspase\u2010specific substrates, Stennicke and colleagues synthesized a panel of IQF substrates (Fig. 4) 78. This strategy also allowed the authors to screen caspase preferences in the prime region (i.e. to the right of the scissile bond). A kinetic analysis revealed that all tested caspases (1, 3, 6, 7 and 8) preferred small residues (Gly, Ser and Ala) at P1\u2032, which could not be used as a discrimination factor to improve the specificity of the synthesized substrates. The inability to design caspase\u2010specific substrates using a PS\u2010SCL approach or by scanning internally quenched substrates could be due to their simple architecture. In these chemical approaches, the substrates are short linear peptides selected from a pool of peptide mixtures without an in\u2010depth caspase subsite cooperativity analysis. Biological approaches represent an alternative strategy for substrate identification. One such strategy tested on caspases was the application of cellular libraries of peptide substrates (CLiPS), developed by Boulware et al. 79, in which potential caspase substrates were randomly synthesized by bacteria and then subjected to fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorting analysis. This technique not only provided a general map of caspase preferences but also revealed detailed kinetic analyses of the substrates. However, the obtained results only confirmed that the preferred caspase\u20103 cleavage motif is DXVD/G, and new specific sequences were not identified. The main limitation of the described methods (using both synthetic and natural substrates) is that all of these peptides contain only natural amino acids in their structure. A potential solution is an approach that has been recently proposed by Poreba et al. 80. In the HyCoSuL approach, P4\u2013P2 peptide mixtures are enriched with over 100 unnatural amino acids, which provides a better exploration of the chemical space in the caspase active sites and attenuates the issue of overlapping specificity. The specificity of six human apoptotic caspases (3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10) toward the P4\u2013P2 positions were screened using this approach. A detailed kinetic analysis of their preferences allowed the development of peptides containing unnatural amino acids that had much greater selectivity indices than the previously reported substrates (Fig. 6). One of these substrates was then used to specifically monitor caspase\u20109 activation in HEK293F cytosolic extracts, in which apoptosis is triggered by cytochrome C 80.",

Because potent and selective caspase inhibitors appear as potential drug candidates, this area of research has been explored more rigorously than the identification of caspase substrates. To date, thousands of caspase inhibitors have been synthesized and evaluated 9. Some caspase inhibitors have been synthesized and used to study apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, whereas others are primarily used in pharmaceutical research 81, 82, 83. In general, almost all strategies for developing caspase\u2010specific inhibitors focus on (a) optimizing a peptide (or peptidomimetic) scaffold (non\u2010prime region), (b) exploring the S1\u2032 pocket by introducing various warheads (cysteine traps) into PS\u2010SCL\u2010derived peptides (mostly DEVD, IETD and YVAD), or (c) optimizing lead non\u2010peptide scaffold structures, such as isatins, indolones and quinolines. In previous studies, synthetic caspase inhibitors were simple peptides equipped with an electrophilic warhead (e.g. acyloxymethylketone (AOMK), fluoromethyl ketone, or an aldehyde) 9. The peptide motifs were based on the PS\u2010SCL results reported by Thornberry et al. 17. However, these tools were subsequently shown to display only limited selectivity toward individual caspases 84, 85. As the inclusion of natural amino acids in the P4\u2010P1 positions has not produced specific inhibitors, unnatural amino acids have been introduced into peptide scaffolds. This work was pioneered by Bogyo and colleagues, who synthesized a P4\u2013P2 combinatorial library of AOMK inhibitors containing 41 unnatural amino acids at each position 86. The same approach was further applied by Wolan and colleagues, who synthesized a P5\u2013P2 peptide library containing an aldehyde as an electrophilic warhead 87, 88, 89. The introduction of unnatural amino acids into the peptide sequence resulted in increased inhibitor selectivity.

One classic example for distinguishing between cathepsins is the optimization of E\u201064, a natural broad\u2010spectrum inhibitor. Katunuma and colleagues have developed several highly selective cathepsin B (CA\u2010030 and CA\u2010074) and cathepsin L (CLIK\u2010148 and CLIK\u2010195) inhibitors by replacing the substituents in the epoxide electrophilic warhead and changing the non\u2010prime recognition group 101. Other cathepsin S\u2010 (CLIK\u2010060) and cathepsin K\u2010specific inhibitors (CLIK\u2010163) were developed based on the structures of leupeptin and pyridoxal phosphate, respectively 101. These examples clearly show that optimization of lead structures (mostly broad spectrum inhibitors) is an excellent strategy for distinguishing closely related enzymes. Another strategy for the development of potent and selective cathepsin inhibitors is the previously mentioned SAS, in which the best substrates are converted into potent inhibitors by replacing the aminocoumarin reporter group with an electrophilic pharmacophore 95.

An analysis of the tertiary structure of legumain assigned it to the CD clan (together with caspases, gingipains and separases).

The first (quenched) activity\u2010based probe that specifically targeted legumain in vivo (LE\u201028) was developed by the Bogyo group 104. It contained a three\u2010peptide scaffold (Glu\u2010Pro\u2010Asp) equipped with an acyloxymethylketone warhead and flanked by two bulky groups (Cy\u20105 as a fluorophore and QSY21 as a fluorescence quencher) (Fig. 4). As Glu\u2010Pro\u2010Asp is the preferred motif of caspases, the specificity of LE\u201028 was obtained not by sequence itself, but by introducing bulky groups that drive LE\u201028 cellular uptake into the lysosomes. Another approach to distinguish legumain from caspases was recently proposed by Poreba et al. 12. Using HyCoSuL, the authors demonstrated that the legumain specificity at the P4 position was very broad, tolerating even d\u2010amino acids (Fig. 6). Thus, it was possible to use counter selection to extract a P4\u2013P1 tetrapeptide motif (with Asp at P1) that was not recognized by apoptotic caspases. This motif was then used to develop a legumain\u2010specific substrate, inhibitor, and activity\u2010based probe for tracking legumain activity in various biological models. This study provided proof of principle for the use of the CoSeSuL approach to develop specific tools for proteases that display broad substrate specificity.",

The screening of over 40 000 compounds against the closely related ubiquitin C\u2010terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH\u2010L1) and L3 (UCH\u2010L3) enzymes allowed the development of a UCHL1\u2010specific inhibitor based on an isatin O\u2010acyl oxime scaffold 105. In another approach, Borodovsky and colleagues used a chemical ligation method (intein strategy), in which the C terminus of the ubiquitin protein was modified with different warheads 106, 107. Depending on the type of warhead, these probes exhibited some level of specificity toward different DUBs.

A kinetic analysis of the P4\u2013P2 positions revealed differences between these enzymes that can be further exploited in the design of specific substrate candidates. The PS\u2010SCL library approach was also used to analyze the substrate specificity of human desumoylating enzymes (sentrin\u2010specific proteases; SENPs). The results from the screen of this library clearly showed similar substrate specificities for natural amino acids in the P4, P3 and P2 positions between SENPs.
