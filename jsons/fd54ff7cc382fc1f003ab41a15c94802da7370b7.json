This important document is a useful guide to the clinician and is available online [ 2 ] . The most recent National Blood Collection Utilization and Survey (NBCUS) reports that 13,775,000 million allogeneic units of whole blood and red cells (RBCs) were transfused in 2011, which is 8.2 % fewer units than in 2008 [ 3 ] . Over 20 million blood components were transfused in 2011 (there is a lag time between the receipt and publication of such data in this and similar reports). Blood centers collected 93.4 % of all components and the remaining amount was collected by hospitals [ 3 ] . The USA continues to transfuse red cells at a greater rate than many other countries, with 44 transfusions per 1000 population; this however, is a >10 % decrease from 48.8 transfusions per 1000 population in 2008 [ 3 ] .",

Apheresis blood collection uses automated technology that allows for the targeted collection of red cells, singledonor platelets, plasma, and leukocytes (usually stem cells or granulocytes). Products may be collected singly or in multiples depending on donor qualifi cation, the device, and FDA regulations. Plasma may be further manufactured into factor derivatives, albumin, and other medical products. Frozen plasma can be further manufactured into cryoprecipitate and cryoprecipitate-poor plasma.

The phenotypes of the ABO blood group system are based on expression of the A, B, and H antigens. A and B alleles are codominant. The O phenotype is recessive.

She claimed that she had the Bombay phenotype, however, the staff did not deem the information to be important and the blood bank was not notifi ed. After several unsuccessful attempts to crossmatch blood for the patient, the sample was referred to the immunohematology reference laboratory (RL) for identifi cation. After extensive workup the Bombay phenotype was identifi ed, and these fi ndings were confi rmed with the patient. Fortunately she did not require transfusion, as the only compatible blood for a person with the Bombay phenotype is from a donor with this precise phenotype. The point is that if a patient communicates that they have a rare blood type, the blood bank should be informed, in order to investigate it, and to allow adequate time to locate compatible blood. Such patients may participate in autologous donation and their red cells may be frozen for future use. Patients with unusual blood needs may wear an emergency alert bracelet stating their condition or may verbally relay the information to the clinical staff .",

Type B RBCs express B antigen and anti-A antibody is present in the plasma. Type O RBCs lack A or B antigen and have anti-A and anti-B antibody in the plasma. Finally, type AB blood expresses both A and B antigens on the red cell surface and lack naturally occurring plasma antibodies [ 11 ] . Naturally occurring blood group antibodies, also called isohemagglutinins , are not present in the newborn (apart from antibodies present due to passive maternal transmission) but develop around 4-6 months of age by a thymusindependent mechanism following exposure to car-bohydrate epitopes on gut bacteria and food [ 11 ] . A and B antigens are found on cardiac, gut, and renal endothelium (and other organs) and additionally exist in a soluble form in secretions; for this reason they are also known as \" histo-blood group antigens \" and as such, are an important consideration in solid organ transplant [ 10 ] (Table 19.1 ). ABO type compatibility is fundamental to avoiding a hemolytic transfusion reaction , which may occur within minutes of beginning the transfusion and with possibly fatal results. ABO antibodies are primarily of the IgM type, which fi x complement well, and are capable of causing acute, intravascular hemolysis. ABO antibodies of the IgG subtype may cause a delayed, extravascular hemolysis. IgG subtypes may also cross the placenta from the maternal circulation to cause hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) [ 12 ] . Antibodies from some blood group systems are more potent than those in other blood group systems in their ability to cause hemolysis [ 12 ] . Only one fatality resulting from ABO-mismatched RBCs was reported to FDA in 2013, accounting for 3 % of the total fatalities reported in that year [ 13 ] . Undoubtedly, many more ABO-mismatching events transpire without resulting in fatality. In 2011, a total of 42 such events were reported to the NBCUS, which amounted to 1 occurrence per 495,207 transfusions in the USA [ 3 ] . It is worth noting that not all hospitals participate in a program of voluntary transfusion reaction reporting, however fatalities due to transfusion must be reported to FDA [ 3 ] . Persons with type AB blood may be given any blood type and are sometimes referred to as being the \"universal recipient \" (Table 19 .2 ). The Rh blood group system is large and the D antigen is one of more than 50 Rh antigens found to date, but the presence or absence of the D antigen on RBCs is still commonly referred to as Rh-positive or Rh-positive, respectively. D antigen expression varies among ethnic groups (Table 19 .1 ). With respect to transfusion, the D antigen is second in importance to the ABO blood group system . For routine transfusion every effort is made to match the ABO/Rh of the unit to the patient; for example, a patient with B-negative blood should ideally receive blood from a donor who is B-negative (type B, Rh-negative), but O-negative blood would be compatible. Anti-A and anti-B antibodies are naturally occurring and are present depending on blood type (Table 19 .1 ). Non-ABO red cell antibodies are sometimes found in patient serum and are called \"unexpected\" alloantibodies . About 5 % of patients have unexpected alloantibodies. These antibodies have formed following exposure (usually from transfusion or pregnancy but possibly from other blood exposure) to red cells possessing antigens foreign to the recipient. Determination of RBC phenotype may be per-formed by serology and molecular testing and may help to predict what antibodies a sensitized person could make. Antibodies differ in their clinical signifi cance, or in their ability to cause hemolysis and/or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) . Extra time may be needed by the blood bank to locate blood for patients with rare or multiple alloantibodies.",

Another group that may automatically receive O-negative blood is all patients under 18 years of age, male or female. For women beyond childbearing age and all males greater than 18 years, O-positive blood may be dispensed right away. This approach has been adopted in many large, urban institutions as the need for emergency or trauma blood could never be sustained if only O-negative units were used.

Pediatric patients should be transfused according to weight, usually at a dose of 10-15 mL/kg [ 21 ] . One milliliter (mL) of RBCs contains 1.08 mg (mg) of iron [ 22 ] . Thus if 200 mL RBCs are donated, approximately 200 mg of iron is lost by the donor and that same amount is ultimately transfused into the recipient [ 22 ] . Hemoglobin levels are not an accurate predictor of iron stores and this is currently an area of great interest regarding US blood donors [ 22 ] . The 2012 REDS-II donor iron status evaluation (RISE) study results reported absent iron stores (ferritin < 12 ng/mL) in as many as 27 % of frequent female donors and 16 % of frequent male donors [ 22 ] . Conversely, the issue of iron overload may exist in blood recipients. Clinically signifi cant iron accumulation may be seen following the transfusion of 50 or more RBC units and possibly sooner in pediatric patients [ 23 ] . The total amount of iron transfused may be calculated using the following equation, where Kin is the total amount of iron infused:",

Pre-storage LR is done during automated apheresis collections or after whole blood collection. Bedside LR, or post-storage LR, remains an alternate but infrequently chosen option. To qualify as a \"Leukocyte Reduced\" product, the residual white cell count must be less than 5 \u00d7 10 6 per unit per FDA criteria, which may be easily met by use of any of the current third and fourth generation LR fi lters [ 25 ] . LR of RBCs decreases the incidence of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, HLA and platelet alloimmunization, and the amount of biologic response modifi ers (BRMs) , which accumulate during product storage [ 26 -28 ] . The equivalency of LR to CMV-negative products continues to be debated. Some physicians consider LR blood to be adequate and essentially equivalent to LR blood that is from CMV-seronegative donors. The rationale is that CMV resides within white cells, and with the effi ciency of modern LR fi lters, any risk of CMV would be exceptionally low [ 29 -31 ] . For CMVseronegative patients, especially those who are peri-or post-transplant, or low birthweight infants, many clinicians request CMV-negative products and accept LR-only products if CMV-negative and LR products are unavailable [ 29 -31 ] . In addition, CMV-seronegative donors who test \"negative for CMV\" on their most recent donation carry a small but real risk of transmitting CMV to a recipient, if the donor happens to be newly infected and is in the window period (the time between infection and the time at which the infection can be detected by testing) [ 29 -31 ] . The test performed on donor blood detects anti-CMV antibodies [ 29 -31 ] . Nucleic acid testing (NAT) testing for CMV DNA is available but is not used for donor testing [ 29 -31 ] . Frequent donors (such as platelet donors ) have a theoretically higher risk of transmitting CMV since they are able donate several times during the 6-8 week window period, whereas a single red cell donor can only donate a single unit in the same period of time [ 29 -31 ] . Indications for CMVnegative blood include the following populations: CMV-seronegative patients who are immunocompromised, fetuses, pregnant females, very-low and low-birthweight infants, transplant recipients of either hematopoietic stem cells or solid organs, and any severely immunocompromised patients including those with HIV.",

TA-GVHD is similar to post-transplant GVHD, affecting HLA-antigen-dense tissues such as the skin, gastrointestinal tract and liver [ 38 ] . There are, however, two fi ndings seen with TA-GVHD: bone marrow aplasia and an earlier onset, usually between day 2 and day 50 following transfusion, which distinguishes it from post-transplant GVHD [ 38 ] .",

            "text": "The outcomes of these studies also reiterate that the incidence of TRALI is much greater in comparison to the data published by NBCUS, which is a voluntary data reporting program. [ 3 ] . The reporting of any death suspected to be related to transfusion, however, is mandatory per FDA [ 13 ] . During fi scal years 2009-2013, 38 % of all transfusion-related deaths reported to FDA were confi rmed to be TRALI-related [ 13 ] . In fi scal year 2013, FDA reported that 37 % of all transfusion-related deaths were attributable to TRALI. Regarding the 14 TRALI-related deaths in 2013, 51 donors were implicated [ 13 ] . Gender data were available for 49 of the donors; 22 were male and 27 were female [ 13 ] . Thirty-eight of the donors were tested for the presence of HLA and HNA antibodies and ten of the 14 implicated donors reportedly had antibodies against cognate antigens in the recipient [ 13 ] . The majority of the deaths were among patients who received RBC transfusions alone or in patients who received multiple blood products [ 13 ] . Post-transfusion reactions consistent with what would now be described as TRALI were fi rst reported in the medical literature in the 1950s; however, the coining of the term \"TRALI\" is attributed to Popovsky and Moore in the mid-1980s as the constellation of fi ndings and symptoms temporally related to transfusion were unifi ed under one diagnosis [ 60 -62 ] . The diagnosis of TRALI begins with the recognition of acute lung injury (ALI) in the patient, defi ned by the American-European Consensus Conference as SpO 2 < 90 % or PaO 2 /FiO 2 > 300 mmHg on room air or other demonstration of hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary edema seen as lung infi ltrates by frontal chest radiograph [ 63 ] . A combined defi nition of TRALI, as defi ned by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Working Group and the Canadian Consensus Conference is an acute, non-cardiogenic lung injury occurring within 6 h of beginning a transfusion (though symptoms are often seen in the fi rst 1-2 h) with respiratory symptoms of tachypnea, dyspnea, pulmonary edema which may be mild to severe and sometimes seen as acomplete \"white-out\" on frontal chest X-ray [ 64 ] . Frothy secretions are sometimes seen coming from the patient's mouth or endotracheal tube. If mea-sured, the pulmonary artery wedge pressure should be less than 18 mmHg and there must not be any new, abnormal cardiac function [ 64 ] . Per this defi nition, TRALI may also be diagnosed in a patient with worsening preexisting pulmonary insuffi ciency (unique to the NHLBI defi nition), such as COPD or pulmonary fi brosis [ 64 ] . A diagnosis of possible TRALI may apply to patients with preexisting clinical risk factors for ALI, such as recent surgery, burn injury, coagulopathy, chronic alcoholism, sepsis, and carcinoma [ 64 ] . There may be hypotension (hypertension followed by hypotension may be seen), fever, chills, non-productive cough, and transient decreases in white cell counts, especially neutrophils [ 64 -66 ] .",

Up to 85 % of TRALI cases may be explained by the infusion of donor antibodies as demonstrated in an ex vivo animal model using isolated perfused rabbit lungs [ 70 ] . In these studies, antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLA) or human neutrophil antigens (HNA) had the ability to bind to neutrophils which expressed the cognate antigen and induce pulmonary edema [ 70 ] . However, the antibody, the cognate antigen on the leukocyte surface, and source of complement (plasma) had to be present in order for ALI to occur and if any of the components was omitted, lung damage was obviated [ 70 ] . This model has been refi ned using rats and demonstrated that a minimum number of antigen sites needed to be present on the neutrophils such that antibody binding must reach a threshold before ALI would occur [ 71 ] . This work was also relevant in showing that priming with fMLF (N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine,a component of bacterial cell walls) allowed anti-HNA antibodies to directly activate neutrophils in the absence of complement [ 71 ] .",

Such an in vivo two-event pathogenesis was confi rmed in a rat model which also demonstrated that lipids and other biologic response modifiers (BRM) could cause TRALI in older, stored RBCs irrespective of leukoreduction [ 74 ] . Both antibodies to MHC class I ligands and the lipids from stored RBCs were capable of priming quiescent neutrophils (PMNs) , activating primed PMNs (defi ned as superoxide anion production and release of granule constituents), and inducing ALI [ 74 ] . Specifi cally, rats that were infused with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, or LPS) alone did not develop ALI, however those rats who received LPS and then received a lipid extraction from 42-day-old RBCs did develop ALI [ 74 ] . Importantly extractions from fresh (day 1) RBCs or plasma did not result in ALI [ 74 ] . In addition, antibodies to common MHC class I or even class II antibodies caused ALI as the second event in this animal model of TRALI, indicating that TRALI, whether caused by antibodies to specifi c leukocyte antigens or due to BRMs that directly prime PMNs, appears to be the results of two distinct events [ 74 ] . The fi rst event is the clinical condition of the patient, which predisposes him to TRALI and the second event is the infusion of the specifi c antibody or BRM into the patient which activates the sequestered PMNs inducing damage to the vascular endothelium, resulting in capillary leak and ALI [ 52 , 74 ] .",

Antibodies to HNA loci, especially HNA-3a, also are postulated to cause TRALI by a two-event pathogenesis as well as inducing TRALI by activating the pulmonary endothelium alone through the CTL-2 receptor [ 77 , 78 ] . Such direct activation may occur without PMNs and could cause TRALI in neutropenic patients [ 77 ] . Other BRMs include soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) which has been shown to prime PMNs and are linked with clinical TRALI [ 79 ] . Whether due to antibodies or other BRMs, the majority of TRALI cases are the results of PMN activation inducing pulmonary endothelial damage [ 52 ] . Histologically, TRALI is indistinguishable from etiologies of diffuse alveolar damage, which include acute interstitial pneumonia, early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and others [ 80 , 81 ] .

During the 1990s the UK National Blood Service created a voluntary hemovigilance program, launching the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) and were the fi rst to collect plasma from male donors, after noting that TRALI or probable TRALI was seen almost seven times more frequently with plasma transfusion and about eight times more frequently with platelet infusion, (in comparison to TRALI occurrence in red cells) when these products were collected from female donors [ 83 ] . Their efforts were rewarded following the adoption of this collection strategy for platelets and plasma, and reports of TRALI from plasma transfusion fell from 15.5 cases per million units transfused (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) to 3 per million (2005-2006) for plasma and from 14 cases per million to just under six cases per million for platelet products [ 83 ] . Densmore and colleagues also showed that HLA antibody formation increased with pregnancy, with about 8 % of never-pregnant females showing sensitization, increasing to 15 % of women after one pregnancy, and to about 26 % after three pregnancies [ 84 ] . Never-transfused men and never-pregnant women have a 1.7 % prevalence of HLA antibodies [ 85 ] . The American Red Cross (ARC) examined their own hemovigilance data and subsequently adopted a similar strategy of collecting plasma from predominantly male donors (95 %) and saw a signifi cant (80 %) decrease in TRALI cases related to plasma infusion [ 86 ] . This similar and dramatic decrease in TRALI when female donors were avoided was also shown by Toy and colleagues, who designed a prospective study involving two major academic centers [ 87 ] .",

Baseline BNP is not likely to be measured unless the patient is already being monitored for heart failure and may not be useful unless the differences are marked.

In the center of each heme group (or molecule) is an iron atom which binds oxygen in the \"relaxed\" or high-oxygen affi nity state and releases it in the \"tensed\" or low-oxygen affi nity state. The ratio of 2,3-DPG (DPG) to hemoglobin is approximately equal in the red cell. The presence of DPG is important as DPG binds to the subunit and favors the unloading of the oxygen into the tissues. As RBCs age, the ability to produce DPG falls and the oxygen-releasing capacity is reduced. Aucar and colleages concluded that aging red cells had the capacity to signifi cantly and adversely affect the global coagulation status of trauma patients when the activated clotting time (ACT) (and controlled for all other factors) was compared at different RBC storage ages, but was especially prolonged between weeks 3 and 5 of RBC storage [ 93 , 94 ] .",

At this time intracellular proteins are released with loss of cellular integrity including peroxiredoxin-2 peroxiredoxin-6, glycolytic enzymes, e.g., \u03b1-enolase [ 99 ] . Some of these enzymes may have the ability to affect extracellular processes and may be masquerading mediators for they may be fully active [ 99 ] . Proteomic analysis has determined that AS-3 is the best additive solution because compared to AS-1, AS-5, and SGAM the intracellular proteins are retained longer [ 97 ] .

In further analysis of these patients, the transfusion of stored RBCs (age \u2265 21 days) was an independent predictor of those patients who developed MOF [ 102 ] . Importantly, these studies were controlled for the amount of blood transfused; all patients with intermediate ISS received 6 units of PRBCs in the fi rst 12 h and similar amounts of other blood products. In addition the mechanism of injury was not different. With new, stricter transfusion parameters using a hemoglobin of 7 g/dl as the trigger, only about 5 % of injured patients developed MOF [ 103 ] .

Creation of blood utilization guidelines should be based on the clinical service's requirements and the usage tools, including transfusion triggers and algorithms, should be developed by each clinical service, supported by medical literature and rooted in patient needs, with involvement from the transfusion medicine pathologist and blood bank. Longer red cell storage times undoubtedly results in cellular alterations, diminished viability and accumulation of undesirable byproducts in the plasma in which cellular blood products are stored. This raises the question: despite the fact that blood may be stored for up to 42 days in additive solution, should it really be transfused up to its date of expiration?",
