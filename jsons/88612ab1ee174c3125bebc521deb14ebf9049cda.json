The TDD-NCP model was developed recently by Cheng a\u0155s group in Fudan and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). The TDD-NCP model introduced the time delay process into the differential equations to describe the latent period of the epidemic. The Fudan-CDCC model was established when Wenbin Chen suggested to determine the kernel functions in the TDD-NCP model by the public data from CDCC.

People were concerned about the spread of epidemic and its development trend. Many mathematical researches focused on the modelling of the spread and development of the COVID-19. For instance, considering the epidemic's feature of spreading during the latent period, Cheng's group applied the time delay process to describe the typical feature and proposed a novel dynamical system to predict the outbreak and evolution of COVID-19. This model was called the Time Delay Dynamical-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (TDD-NCP) model. 1, 2 Based on this work, Chen et al also proposed a time delay dynamic system with an external source to describe the trend of local outbreak for COVID-19. 3 Then, considering the fractional order derivatives, Chen et al proposed a novel time delay dynamic system with fractional order. 4 In their system, the Riemann-Liouville derivative was added that can describe the confirmed and cured people's growth process. Later, based on Chinese Centers for Disease Control's (CCDC's) statistical data, Shao et al proposed a series time delay dynamic system (called the Fudan-CCDC model), 5 and they estimated the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 in their study 6 based on Wallinga and Lipsitch frame work. 8 The conclusion was, the R 0 estimated is in [3.25, 3.4] of COVID-19 that is bigger than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We refer our readers to some paralleled results. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] In 23 February, the Fudan-CCDC model is specially used to warn that there could be a rapid outbreak in Japan if no effective quarantine measures are carried out immediately. 7 In this paper, we provide a brief introduction of the TDD-NCP model 1, 2 and Fudan-CCDC model. 5 We use the Fudan-CCDC model to reconstruct some important parameters (including growth rate, isolation rage, initial date) and predict the cumulative number of confirmed cases in some of cities in China. In addition, due to the serious concern of possible severe outbreak in Japan, we also analyse the different evolutions of COVID-19 in Japan with different isolation rates in future days.
