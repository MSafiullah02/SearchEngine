This is a single-stranded positive RNA virus having a large genome (30 kb). The virus has club-shaped spikes that are visible under the electron microscope as a solar corona; hence the name- coronavirus [Figure 1]. It attaches to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2)[2] via the spike protein to gain entry into cells. ACE2 receptors are found in the lungs, nasopharynx, heart, kidneys, brain, intestines, vascular endothelium, and testicles. In the brain, ACE2 receptors are found especially in the brain stem cardiovascular regulatory areas.[3]",

This was also true of the pandemic of SARS in 2002\u20132003. Li- Kai Tsai and colleagues[5] retrospectively described 4 patients (out of a total of 76 patients) with peripheral neuromuscular manifestations during the SARS CoV 1 pandemic in Taiwan. All their patients were critically ill and demonstrated limb weakness 3 weeks after the onset of the viral infection. Two patients had an axonal motor sensory neuropathy, one had a combination of neuropathy with severe myopathy, and one had mild myopathy. However, the authors attributed all of these due to critical illness neuromyopathy due to either the systemic inflammatory response due to the virus or the high-dose steroids used to treat these patients. They also mentioned 2 other infected patients with markedly elevated creatine kinase levels and rhabdomyolysis.",

The retrospective, observational case series by Mao and colleagues from Wuhan, China[6] described peripheral neurological involvement in COVID-19. Of the 214 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 36.4% (78 patients) had symptoms of the nervous system. They classified neurological manifestations as those involving the central nervous system (dizziness, headaches, stroke, seizures, and altered sensorium), peripheral nervous system (8.9%) (taste/smell impairment, nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury (10.7%). These authors reported that neurological manifestations were more common in those who were severely affected by the COVID-19. The patients with neurological manifestations were older, more likely to have comorbid conditions (like hypertension, diabetes) and did not reveal the typical COVID-19 features of fever and dry cough. The onset of neurological features was seen early in the disease course (days 1 to 3); alarmingly in some patients, it was the sole presentation of COVID-19. Those with neurological syndromes had elevated C-reactive protein, increased D dimer levels, and reduced lymphocyte counts.",

These subjects did not have a fever or upper/lower respiratory tract symptoms or cough before the smell abnormality. Hypogeusia has observed in 5.6% of the Wuhan cohort[6] and all the Italian subjects. Lechien et al.[8] observed 85.6% (357 out of 417 COVID-19 subjects) of infected patients (predominantly Europeans) to have an abnormality of smell (79.6% were anosmic and 20.4% hyposmic). In 33.6% of the subjects, the abnormalities of smell preceded or were associated with the general symptoms of COVID-19. Gustatory abnormalities have been reported in 88.8% of the infected individuals. Besides, in 72.6% of these patients, the smell abnormality improved completely within 8 days of the resolution of other features of the disease. The abnormality of smell and taste seems to be more prevalent in the Europeans than the Chinese.",
