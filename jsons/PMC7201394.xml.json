Older people, men and those with medical comorbidities including chronic pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes and a compromised immune system have a much higher likelihood of complications including ARDS, renal failure and death. People who smoke or vape tobacco or cannabis products and people who are dependent on opioids and methamphetamine use may also be at increased risk of complications due to the respiratory and pulmonary effects of SARS-Cov2 infection.

Globally, substance use disorders are estimated to have a prevalence of 100.4 million persons for alcohol, 22.1 million for cannabis and 26.8 million for opioids. 4.2% of all disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributable to alcohol use whilst 1.3% of all DALYS were attributed to other drugs [5]. There are an estimated 15.6 million people who inject drugs internationally [6]. Globally, 17.8% of people who inject drugs live with HIV infection, whilst 52.3% are HCV antibody positive, of whom many will be HCV RNA positive [7]. Compared to the general population, people with substance use disorders (SUD) are more likely to have a higher burden of comorbid medical conditions [8, 9]. They are also more likely to experience social and economic disadvantage, homelessness and residential instability [10, 11], imprisonment [12] and difficulties with transportation and often face considerable barriers to accessing health services, including stigma and discrimination from healthcare professionals [13]. People with severe disease may rotate between emergency departments, withdrawal and other drug treatment facilities, homeless shelters and correctional facilities, raising challenges for prevention, screening, isolation and treatment of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Treatment services for people who use drugs, and in particular and opiate agonist treatment (methadone and buprenorphine), deserve special attention in the response to the pandemic.\nOpioid agonist treatment (OAT) should be considered an essential treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, as significant risks to the community exist with an interruption of the stable provision of opioid treatment. Methadone and buprenorphine are on the WHO list of essential medications [14].Patients on OAT are particularly vulnerable to disruptions caused by a pandemic. Co-occurring health conditions and daily dosing in large clinics may crowd many patients in close proximity on a daily or near-daily basis increasing their susceptibility to COVID-19 infections. Opiate agonist treatment dosing and community pharmacy staff have increased infection risks providing these services.Given the above vulnerabilities, without proactive measures, patients attending treatment services may be more susceptible to develop COVID-19 infections, may be less likely to be tested for SARS-CoV2, have increased difficulty complying with home isolation and may be in living situations where the infection may spread rapidly [15].Surging demands elsewhere in the health system resulting in resource and staff redeployment to support other high priority health services risks disrupting critical harm reduction services that could reverse gains made in the treatment and prevention of HIV and hepatitis B and C. As such, planning to ensure these services remain open and accessible is critical.Substance use counselling and withdrawal services may experience changing demand depending on other factors during COVID-19. Distress may result in some people increasing their substance use and subsequently require treatment (for example, alcohol use may increase). Changes in illicit drug supply may occur due to a range of complex interacting factors, with an increased demand for services. Alternately, some people who use drugs may be less likely to request services during the pandemic, with an escalation of substance use during a time of distress.There may be increased risk of opioid overdose arising from (a) erratic access to methadone or buprenorphine dosing, (b) erratic access to illicit heroin supplies and (c) increased access to take-away doses of methadone/buprenorphine necessitating expansion of take-home naloxone supplies, particularly where treatment services are providing increased take-away doses of OAT.COVID-19 itself has potential to increase overdose risk among people with SUD with chronic lung disease, previously identified as a risk factor for overdose mortality [16], and methamphetamine use may place people at increased risk of pulmonary hypertension [17], a risk factor for COVID-19 complications.",

While providing additional methadone take-away doses carries individual and public health risks, these can be minimised by ensuring access to take-home naloxone programmes with naloxone by nasal spray, pre-prepared injection or ampoules of naloxone.

Some hospital inpatient units may be re-purposed by acute hospitals for use as respiratory or other overflow wards. If this is the case, where appropriate, ambulatory withdrawal services should be encouraged to avoid unnecessary admissions and patient congregation in residential or inpatient services. This imposes extra challenges to withdrawal services as additional resources in order to function adequately might be required. As possible measures to be implemented, the use of daily staged medication supply (i.e. daily dosing) during withdrawal should be reconsidered to reduce unnecessary patient travel/attendance at hospital and community pharmacies. In addition, alternative approaches such as increased telephone monitoring and use of carers in the treatment process (e.g. holding medications) may be required.

            "text": "Principles to inform adjustments to D&A services in the face of an impending pandemic include the following:\nStaff health and welfare. Critical to service continuity for D&A services is to work with frontline staff to ensure that they are supported to continue working, comply with policies to not attend work, home-isolate and be SARS-CoV2 tested if they have respiratory symptoms or meet the criteria for a suspected case. Ensure adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, examine measures to limit staff face to face contact with COVID-19 cases where possible, provide videoconference consultations and avoid travel (e.g. via airports) that expose staff to greater infection risks, identify staff with particularly increased vulnerabilities (pregnancy, chronic diseases, advanced age) and consider redeployment. Staff who live with family at high risk are also presented with the challenge of potentially self-isolation at home or being unable to return to their homes. There is considerable \u2018COVID-19 anxiety\u2019 and staff frustration with cancellation of leave or the imposition of additional duties. Consideration of opportunities to improve staff welfare should be a focus where possible particularly if the pandemic becomes protracted. Monitoring of the health of health care workers is important. A study of health care workers in Beijing, China, that followed up staff who worked during the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003 identified an association between health care workers who worked in high-risk locations, such as SARS wards, and subsequent PTSD or alcohol use problems [21].Clear communication. Draw on established risk communication principles to keep patients and staff informed as trusted partners [22]. Communicate early, with clarity and transparency, acknowledge current problems, discuss achievements with humility and pay attention to expressed and unvoiced concerns. Ensure communications have a clear call to actions required, as well as what D&A services are doing to manage risk and ensure business continuity.Early intervention. The earlier that strategies are enacted to reduce SARS-CoV2 transmission and exposure for both patients and staff, the lesser impact services are likely to experience, enabling service continuity and managing fear and anxiety.Social distancing, reduced congregation and hygiene/infection control enhancement. The rationale for this is to reduce the risk of community transmission via confirmed/unconfirmed case contact during this pandemic. This strategy reduces the effective reproductive rate of the pathogen [23]. The principles for this include culture change in terms of standard precautions for infection control, limiting unnecessary gatherings, analysing root causes to prevent congregation and enhance movement of patients through a service. Alternative approaches to service delivery including patient contact by telephone or videoconferencing will reduce the need for travel and reduce the risk of congregation.",
