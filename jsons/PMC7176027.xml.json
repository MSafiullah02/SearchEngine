            "text": "Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the result of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and its main feature is T cell immune function defect [1]. HIV mainly exists in the blood, semen, vaginal secretions and milk of infected people. Therefore, it is usually transmitted between people through direct sexual contact, iatrogenic and perinatal transmission [2], [3]. Since 1997, the annual incidence of AIDS in the world has declined slightly, but it is still one of the most important causes of death in the world\u2019s major disease burden [4]\u2013[7]. It is estimated that there were 1.8 million new infections in 2016, with an average life expectancy of 40.32 years. About 70% of these new infections occur in low and middle-income countries, with investment spending reaching 8.13 billion US dollars [8]. In recent years, the number of AIDS cases reported annually has increased [9], [10]. In addition, the mortality rate of AIDS in class B statutory infectious diseases is the highest from 2008 to 2017, and the vaccine has not been determined [11], [12]. Therefore, facing the major public health challenges and threats brought by AIDS, and providing a clear and quantitative direction for effective formulation of preventive plans and rational allocation of limited available resources, this is a high-precision and accurate understanding of the prediction model of AIDS epidemic behavior is necessary. Jia J established an HIV / AIDS epidemic model with general nonlinear incidence and treatment methods, and studied the stability of disease-free balance and unique local balance [13]. Wang Yawen established the combination of autoregressive moving average model, generalized regression neural network and ARIMA model. ARIMA (1,1,1) (0,1,1) 12 and ARIMA-GRNN model can better predict the monthly incidence of AIDS in China, but the effect of the combined model is better [14]. Yang K used nonparametric local smoothing method to develop a flexible and effective data modeling method for St disease incidence, monitoring the incidence of cancer, AIDS, cardiovascular disease and other chronic or infectious diseases, with good results [15]. Mar Masi \u00e1used the multi state method to predict the development of PLWH into non AIDS events, and estimated three transfer probabilities: from alive and NAE free to alive and NAE experienced (\u201cNAE development\u201d); from alive and NAE experienced to death (\u201cdeath after NAE\u201d) [16]. Rezaei s elucidates the overall prevalence of depression in HIV / AIDS patients through systematic review and meta-analysis [17]. Adamu incidence rate in various states affected by insurgency activities in Boko Haram, Nigeria, collected data from 2004 to 2017, reporting 16 [18]. The information of 102 patients, including age, gender, diagnosis year and patient status, found that most of the HIV / AIDS infected people were women in these Boko Haram areas. Although these laws were discovered, they did not give a trend of future incidence rate. Deribew A studied the development trend of HIV / AIDS mortality in Ethiopia from 1990 to 2016, found that the decline of HIV / AIDS mortality was relatively slow, and provided the corresponding HIV testing and treatment plan, but did not give a future development trend, and the plan had a certain lag [19].",

It combines the bottom features of data into the top features through deep neural network, and is used for classification, prediction and other tasks. Compared with the traditional shallow learning methods such as neural network, logic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, etc., its network depth is deeper, its nonlinear representation ability is stronger, and its network learning ability is stronger. Shallow learning is often ineffective in dealing with complex problems, even when the number of samples is sufficient. This is because the network complexity is low and the learning ability is not strong. Even if a large number of samples are input, some important details cannot be learned. However, in the past, due to the limitation of computing power, blindly increasing the number of layers and parameters of the network is easy to lead to slow convergence and over fitting of the network. Today\u2019s deep learning technology can effectively solve these problems. While increasing the network depth, greedy layer by layer training method is used to prevent over fitting and improve the network performance.",

Secondly, in the construction of RNN model, due to the lack of mature theoretical guidance on the optimal number of hidden cells, feedback delay and other key parameters. Although mhpso algorithm is used to improve the number of singular numbers in this paper, its specific simulation and prediction process is largely unknown. Third, it is estimated that 32.4% of AIDS patients in China do not know their infection status. Therefore, the actual situation may be more serious than the estimated situation. Fourthly, many complex factors, including unpredictable factors, may lead to the occurrence and spread of AIDS. The prediction model we built only relies on the known AIDS cases in the past, without considering other factors to predict the unknown cases. Therefore, if conditions permit, factors related to the occurrence and development of AIDS are expected to be used together to assess the epidemic. Finally, the prediction model is based on the cases in China from January 2004 to April 2018. Therefore, the analysis of the epidemic only represents the situation and trend of AIDS in the country.
