Obviously your immune system is doing something amazing to keep all of that dismantling from happening when you are alive . (1951-) One of controlling systems in the body which the body also uses for communication ( externally and internally ) is the Immune system , based upon existence of MHC molecules fundamental for recognition , and other molecules responsible for antigen -presentation and immediate or postponed reaction to it. The fundamental unique feature of immune system cells is the capability of distinguishing \" self \" from \" nonself \" cells and proteins. Communication between different cell types of the immune system is critical in the recognition of self , surveillance , defense , and clearance of foreign invaders. These signaling mechanisms involve direct cellcell signaling as well as autocrine and paracrine signaling. The essential feature of particular cells of immunological system is memory and although still known at the level of phenomenology , presents the basis for vaccines .",

            "text": "During antigen recognition, cell-cell communication is mediated by a ligand on the surface of APC (it is MHC complex), binding to a receptor on the T cell (TCR complex). The body contains an inventory or repertoire of T cells bearing a large variety of a very different TCRs; each version of TCR is capable of recognizing a single antigen, so that population contains T-cells, that will recognize virtually any antigen. Each T-cell expresses only one type of TCR, specifi c for a particular antigen. Thus, millions of T-cells each with an antigen specifi c receptor continually sample the surface of Apes to determine whether the presented peptide matches the binding site for the receptor they carry. This scanning process takes place in the lymph draining nodes where circulating APCs and T cells most meet. T cell briefl y binds to MHC-peptide complex on the surface of APC. It is not a simple matching process but requires multiple signals: the involvement of co-stimulatory molecules, for full T-cell activation (B7 has to match to CD28). When a match occurs, signal transduction pathways are activated. This, multiple receptor-legend interactions must simultaneously occur before the specialized signal of antigen recognition can be transduced into T-cell. After recognition, T-cells will be activated and undergo clonal expansion caused by autocrine signaling of a cytokines called interleukin 2 (IL-2) which is a growth factor. Thus, many copies of the antigen-specifi c T-cells are produced.",

The science of vaccination began with Edward Jenner in 1796 and his observation that milk maids who contracted cowpox due to their exposure to farm cows became immune to small pox from the pus in the blisters formed by cowpox [ 8 ] . Jenner subsequently tested his hypothesis on an 8-year old boy and was successful [ 8 ] . He inoculated the boy with cowpox blisters initially from which he developed only a mild illness. Later the same boy was inoculated with small pox or variola particles. The child showed immunity developing no sign of disease [ 8 ] .

Even though vaccination is probably the most benefi cial therapy that a physician can provide a patient, there are still signifi cant roadblocks to the development and licensing of new vaccines [ 9 ] . The greatest roadblock is the lack of a complete understanding of how the human immune system \"works\". Early vaccines were developed using technology from the 19th and 20th centuries: inactivation by heat, chemicals, and irradiation to produce a killed vaccine, vaccination with a serologically related virus a' la Jenner, and attenuation by tissue culture passage to produce live vaccines with substantially reduced virulence [ 9 ] . These methodologies have failed to usher in vaccines against new and emerging diseases. Unmet targets for vaccine development include some of the more diffi cult infectious agents, such as human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV), Ebola , cytomegalovirus, Dengue virus, Human Parvovirus B19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ; bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Neisseria gonorrhea , or Mycobacterium tuberculosis ; and parasitic diseases, such as malaria or hookworm disease [ 9 , 10 ] .

Such an interdisciplinary approach is promising as research endeavors are now a part of the post genomic era, a common acceptance that all diseases have a genetic component. In microbiology the pathogen's genome is equally important to the host's genome in the establishment of a disease state. Experts in human and microbial genomic exploitation and information extrapolation, both of which rely on the domain expertise of the applied scientist must form a bridge with the biologist in an effort to develop better and more effective vaccines. While it is no secret that disciplines such as bioengineering, bioinformatics, and artifi cial intelligence cannot replace traditional wet-lab biology, it cannot be disputed that these disciplines and their associated tools have accelerated biomedical research at astounding rates.

The need to bridge the translational gap, as well as current stringent regulations for vaccine testing There are 3 roadblocks listed but 1 holds more importance than the remaining 2, the fi rst. There are still unanswered questions as to how exactly the immune system responds to pathogens. This is why both computer simulation studies and clinical studies of infected individuals are necessary. Yet the latter can be enhanced by the former. Mathematics can help us understand some of the complex cellular and molecular processes that make up the immune system [ 7 ] . Thus modeling the activity of a vaccine's impact on the immune system can provide insight which can ultimately lead to the development-roadblock #2-and clinical testing-roadblock #3-of novel vaccines. Hence overcoming the fi rst roadblock must happen fi rst, and modeling and simulation studies may help that to occur sooner while enhancing our knowledge base of how exactly the immune system processes pathogens. This greater understanding can be achieved both by analyzing models that formalize the biological ideas and by using mathematical methods to extract information from experiments that may not be accessible to a more intuitive biological approach [ 12 ] .",

B cell proliferation serves two purposes. The fi rst is to produce additional cells that can search the body for the pathogen bearing the epitope and the second is to confer immunity to the human host.

The latter of the three are phagocytes, which are capable of engulfi ng pathogens that have entered the body, and later presenting them to the helper T cells [ 13 , 14 ] . The CD4 functions as a co-receptor and helps to activate the helper T cell. It also interacts with the MHC-2 antigens on the surface of the phagocytic cell [ 13 ] .",

In the post genomic era vaccine design will take on new techniques as well as reinvent some of the older means of producing vaccines. This type of progress will require the involvement of not only the microbiologists, but engineers, and informaticians as well to name a few. Current vaccines against the Ebola have yet to be tested at a time of crisis and there is much doubt surrounding their expected rate of effi cacy. The human immune system though very complex can be studied using the Ebola model with the hope of not only saving lives, but setting an example for rational Example from Author's Co-Llaborative Work: RVD for Ebola Virus vaccine design-exploitation of the virus' antigens and the immune systems natural ability to recognize, remove, and repair. Thus a super-vaccine geared towards Ebola should at least contain viral epitopes towards both MHC-2:CD4+ and MHC-1:CD8+ cell interactions. Activation of the former will result in B cell activation and expansion and subsequently antibody production towards the Ebola virus. Activation of the latter will supply the immune system with a fl eet of cytotoxic effector cells capable of eliminating virus on contact. Additional epitopes could be used to involve other components of the immune system such as Natural Killer (NK) cells, macrophage, complement and other non-specifi c responses.",
