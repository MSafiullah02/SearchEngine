            "text": "Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to enable automated data transmission and offer ubiquitous wireless connectivity for trillions of devices (e.g., smart phones and sensors) with the capabilities of sensing, communication, computation and control. The vast amount of data generated by IoT devices can be exploited to extract useful information by machine learning, thereby enabling various intelligent IoT services. The emerging intelligent IoT applications include self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotics, healthcare, and supply chain finance, etc. However, enabling the paradigm shift from \"connected things\" to \"connected intelligence\" in the era of 6G via modern machine learning techniques [1] faces three main challenges among others. First, transmitting data with private information to the cloud server is susceptible to eavesdropping and data modification attacks. Second, aggregating a large volume of distributed data for model learning over radio channels is likely to cause network congestion and lead to excessive network latency, due to limited spectrum resources. Third, many connected devices have strong computation capabilities, which have not been fully exploited to collaboratively train sophisticated models with high performance and accuracy requirements [2] . Federated machine learning [3] is a promising solution for privacy-sensitive and low-latency intelligent IoT applications K. Yang, Y. Shi, Y. Zhou and Z. Yang are with ShanghaiTech University; L. Fu is with Xiamen University; Wei Chen is with Tsinghua University. and has the capability of harnessing distributed computation resources [4] , [5] . Specifically, federated machine learning allows each IoT device to keep its data locally and only requires each IoT device to upload its locally updated model to the edge aggregation server during model training via wireless links. This prevents revealing the collected data at the IoT devices to other devices and the aggregation server, thereby enhancing device privacy and data security. The shared global model with high prediction accuracy can be learned at the edge aggregation server by coordinating a fleet of IoT devices to participate model aggregation. The learning latency can be significantly reduced by leveraging advanced federated machine learning techniques to avoid offloading data to the cloud data center. Although more selected devices can yield better model aggregation performance, periodical model updating from the selected IoT devices becomes the key communication bottleneck to unleash the full potential of federated machine learning for intelligent IoT applications.",

This can be achieved by concurrent transmissions of analog locally updated models at each device, followed by directly receiving the average of local models at the edge server. This perfectly matches the functional computation of a weighted average of the local model updates for model aggregation to update a global model at the edge server in federated machine learning. Instead of treating the signals from other devices as interference in conventional multiple access schemes for mobile data services, AirComp is able to harness interference to reduce the spectrum resource requirements in the learning process over radio channels.

Through jointly controlling all reflecting elements, RIS is able to introduce a desired phase shift on the incident signals, which can be exploited to enhance the signal power and mitigate the co-channel interference. In addition, it turns out that RIS has the huge potential to be integrated with many emerging technologies, including edge machine learning, multiple-input multiple- output communications [10] , Terahertz communication, and sparse-code multiple access [11] . In this article, we shall develop a novel simultaneous access scheme empowered by RIS to boost the performance of model aggregation, thereby designing a communication-efficient federated machine learning framework for intelligent IoT.

Being able to interactively react to unexpected events, IoRT has wide applications in many manufacturing industries, including precision agriculture and industrial IoT. A single robot normally makes decisions based on the local observations and limited intelligence capability, which leads to excessive decision-making delay and inaccurate reactions to the dynamic environments. Federated machine learning has the great potential to fully leverage the computation capabilities of distributed robots to achieve collaborative intelligence, thereby enhancing the capability of performing more complex and challenging interactive tasks. 5) Supply Chain Finance: Supply chain finance integrated with machine learning and IoT is capable of speeding up the capital and information flows throughout the supply chain, thereby reducing the financial gap between the buyers and suppliers. In particular, the data from industrial monitoring in supply chain systems need to be transferred among different business entities and can be exploited to identify and extract underlying patterns with cutting-edge machine learning technologies. Being highly sensitive and also the key interests of business entities, the supply chain data however are vulnerable to security issues in such a distributed system. Federated machine learning provides a new solution to avoid information leakage as well as reduce the performance risk and the credit risk for supply chain finance.",

Specifically, the learning process of federated machine learning typically incurs hundreds of communication rounds, in each of which many devices update local models through a wireless multi-access channel. The communication loads for iterative model updates grow linearly with the number of involved IoT devices when the conventional orthogonal multiple access scheme is adopted. A high volume of communication loads may lead to severe network congestion, which in turn incurs excessive network latency. To tackle the communication bottleneck during the model aggregation period in federated machine learning over radio channels, we shall present a new simultaneous access scheme based on AirComp to reduce the required radio resources by integrating the computation and communication. The reconfigurable intelligent surface is further leveraged to boost the performance of AirComp via alleviating the unfavorable wireless propagation conditions.",

AirComp turns out to be an effective wireless data aggregation approach via exploiting the signal superposition property of the wireless multiple access channel. The class of target functions that can be computed over-the-air is called the nomographic function. Basically, a nomographic function can be evaluated by preprocessing the input data at each device, and then taking the sum of all data after preprocessing, followed by postprocessing the summation. Fig. 3 illustrates the procedures of computing a nomographic function from distributed IoT devices using the AirComp approach. Specifically, the input data after pre-processing is encoded as the transmit symbol at each device. By transmitting the encoded information symbols at all IoT devices over the wireless multiple access channel, the sum of all pre-processed input data can be directly decoded at the receiver with carefully designed transmit and receive strategies. The target function can be obtained by post-processing the sum of all pre-processed input data.",

Such a problem is generally a computationally difficult nonconvex bi-quadratic programming problem [14] , i.e., nonconvex quadratic with respect to both the receive beamformer and RIS phase shift matrix. To decouple the optimization variables, the receive beamformer and the phase shifts are updated in an alternating fashion.
