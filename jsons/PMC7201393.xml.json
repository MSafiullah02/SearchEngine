While uncommon, conjunctivitis can be an early manifestation of the disease and can precede pneumonia by several days [3\u20135]. A retrospective study of 1099 COVID-19 cases across 30 Chinese hospitals identified nine patients (0.8%) with documented conjunctival congestion [6]. However, ocular signs could be more prevalent than noted in retrospective reports. In COVID-19 patients who underwent dedicated ophthalmic examination, 12 of 38 (31.6%) had conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, or epiphora [5]. Patients with conjunctivitis have had SARS-CoV-2 detected in tears, suggesting infectivity [7]. It is unclear whether viral shedding occurs in the tears of positive cases without ocular signs [8].",
