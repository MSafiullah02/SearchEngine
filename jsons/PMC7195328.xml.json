The LDT interpreted 42.8 % (77/180) specimens as detected for SARS-CoV-2, and the Panther Fusion interpreted 43.3 % (78/180) as detected (Table 1\n). Detected samples included a wide range of cycle threshold (Ct) values, with a median of 31.5 (IQR 23.9\u201335.3) for the SHC assay, and 31.4 (IQR 25.9\u201336.1) for the Panther Fusion. Overall percent agreement between the two assays was 98.3 % (95 % CI 95.2\u201399.7). The PPA was 98.7 % (95 % CI 93.0\u2013100) and the NPA was 98.1 % (95 % CI 93.1\u201399.8). The kappa coefficient was 0.97 (95 % CI 0.93\u20131.0), indicating excellent agreement. One sample was detected on the LDT and not on the Panther Fusion, and had a Ct of 35.9. Repeat testing from the original sample on the Panther Fusion remained negative, and repeat testing from the eluate on the LDT was positive. Conversely, 2 samples were detected on the Panther Fusion and not on the LDT, and had Ct values of 37.2 and 36.6. Repeat testing on the Panther Fusion was not possible due to lack of remaining sample, and repeat testing on the LDT remained negative.",

Furthermore, the global shortage of critical reagents and consumables necessitated that laboratories diversify their arsenal of platforms and methods in order to attempt to meet testing demand. This unique situation created an urgent need to understand the relative test performance of each SARS-CoV-2 assay in use, which is particularly important given the clinical and public health implications of both false-positive and false-negative results.",

There were a limited number of discrepant results, and these were observed at relatively late cycle thresholds. The similar performance of these assays allowed our laboratory to increase testing capacity when needed, and also strengthened our ability to withstand supply chain disruption and instrument down-time. The Panther Fusion has a higher throughput with less hands-on time that the SHC LDT, though the SHC LDT has EUA for bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, a specimen type that is not authorized on the Panther Fusion. The E gene primer-probe set, which underlies the SHC LDT, was previously adapted to the Panther Fusion open access protocol to automate SARS-CoV-2 testing [5]. The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay used in this study targets two distinct, conserved regions of ORF1ab in one channel. Compared to a single-target approach, this dual-target design helps to ensure virus detection should mutation impact one of the target regions.",
