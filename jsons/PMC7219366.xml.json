On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, marking the first pandemic declaration since H1N1 in 2009. The early reported mortality rate, which was between 0.4 and 4.3%, appeared lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [1,2]. Current estimates of mortality rate for COVID-19 are believed to be inaccurate, however, with some believing they are underestimates, since most confirmed patients remain as inpatients, and others believing they are overestimates, because mild and asymptomatic cases are not being included in the denominator [1,3]. Many different strategies have been proposed and implemented worldwide in an attempt to contain this pandemic, some more successful than others. In Spain, the number of COVID-19 cases is growing exponentially [4]. Unfortunately, as in many countries, radical measures were undertaken in a reactive rather than proactive manner: not until March 14, 2020, was a State of Emergency (implementation of stringent lock-down measures for the population) declared in Spain [5].",

As per recommendations from various sources, including specific guidance in orthopaedics [6], there has been a reduction in elective clinics and surgeries to shift manpower towards acute specialties combatting COVID-19 and maximize the hospital beds and resources available. This rapid change in clinic provisions and the rescheduling of patients causes substantial inconvenience to patients and potentially poses a risk, due to delayed assessments and treatment, but is a necessity given the gravity of the current situation [7]. By limiting surgeries and clinics to emergent indications only, unnecessary exposure and contamination are limited for both patients and healthcare workers. However, this also results in delayed assessments for many patients, and ultimately adds to the healthcare burden, as some may not receive care until their disease is more advanced and potentially requiring hospital admission [6,8]. Trauma and orthopaedics may not seem to be in the frontline with coronavirus, but we do play a key role, and this must be planned for.",

This is likely because, like many countries around the world, the Spanish government has imposed quarantines and travel bans on an unprecedented scale. Flattening the curve \u2014 slowing the spread of COVID-19 across space and time \u2014 is critical, because no healthcare system can sustain a massive influx of infectious cases to emergency departments and hospitals [11]. With the population being encouraged and/or mandated to stay at home, there are lower risks of traffic and workplace accidents. Currently in many countries, only essential work is being performed on site, the majority of the work being performed remotely, even involving certain medical specialties [5,12]. This reduction in service visits, accidents and hospital admissions also might be explained by there being an understandable fear of visiting hospitals among the public. This fear can be expected to exist to a greater degree in areas where COVID-19 is more prevalent. At the time of this writing, on April 02, 2020 in Spain, there had been 102,136 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, with 9,053 deaths [4].",

A systematic review of 257,367 patients demonstrated that operative delays beyond 48 hours after admission may increase the odds of 30-day all-cause mortality in hip fracture patients [16]. Similarly, Nyholm et al, in an analysis of 3,517 hip fracture surgeries, found that a surgical delay of more than twelve hours significantly increased thirty-day mortality [17]. Recent studies also have demonstrated that older patients with medical comorbidities are more adversely affected by COVID-19 infections, owing to their diminished functional reserves and weakened immune systems [18]. This is important to consider in the hip-fracture population, the majority of whom are older and have multiple medical co-morbidities (in our study, the mean age of these patients was 86.9 years old). During this type of pandemic, which most adversely affects this exact population, these patients may need to be prioritized for early surgery even more so than normal, which may help to reduce their length of stay and, thus, their probability of acquiring a nosocomial infection like COVID-19. In the largest randomized controlled trial to assess hip fracture patients, published recently, an accelerated care pathway was found to be associated with a significantly shorter length of hospital stay [19]. Because of the risk of infection and deaths among hip fracture patients with COVID-19, at our center we have developed an algorithm for caring for these patients during the pandemic, which is initiated at patient admission (Figure 3\n). Among the osteoporotic hip fracture patients analyzed during the Spanish State of Emergency, 19.4% were COVID-19 positive at admission. Given this rate of positive tests, a routine COVID-19 test at admission for all patients with osteoporotic hip fracture was performed, which also may help to protect healthcare personal.",
