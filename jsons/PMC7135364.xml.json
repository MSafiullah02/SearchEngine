The disease spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection, so-called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was known to be diverse in severity, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to mild respiratory tract infection and severe or fatal pneumonia. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted within the family, in the community, among cruise passengers and in hospitals, and has become a public-health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020. As of 28 February 2020, laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 56 countries and territories with more than 83 382 cases reported globally; more than 78 832 of these cases were reported from China (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).",

Currently, there are four genera in the subfamily Coronavirinae of the family Coronaviridae: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus. Before the current COVID-19 epidemic, there were six recognised human respiratory coronaviruses, including HCoV-229E (Alphacoronavirus), HCoV-OC43 (Betacoronavirus), HCoV-NL63 (Alphacoronavirus) and HKU1 (Betacoronavirus) that often cause mild respiratory tract infection as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that in contrast can lead to severe or even fatal lower respiratory tract disease [9]. The seventh human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which also contains SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",

The discovery and marketing of new compounds often require months to years. However, in the face of the global spread of COVID-19, effective interventions for severe cases of COVID-19 are urgently required. Although little is known about SARS-CoV-2, several insights may be gained from its more well-known family member, SARS-CoV [11]. Here we review the literature on an existing but not approved antiviral agent, remdesivir, which exhibits promising in vitro antiviral activity and preliminary clinical experiences in the treatment of COVID-19.",

For the RdRp target in the genus Betacoronavirus, there are several potential drugs or compounds, including favipiravir, ribavirin, penciclovir, galidesivir, remdesivir, 6\u2032-fluorinated aristeromycin analogues and acyclovir fleximer analogues [12]. Remdesivir (GS-5734), the phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine C\u2011nucleoside [13], has a similar structure to tenofovir alafenamide, which is a nucleotide analogue of adenosine 5-monophosphate with antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It was developed by Gilead Science Inc. and has not been licensed or approved anywhere so far. Moreover, GS-441524 has been recommended for the treatment of cats with feline infectious peritonitis, which is uncommon but fatal and is caused by a feline coronavirus [14].",

Recently, the antiviral activity of remdesivir was demonstrated at the stage after virus entry into Vero E6 cells, supporting its antiviral mechanism as a nucleotide analogue [18].",

Using MHV as the tested coronavirus, two of three lineages of wild-type MHV in the presence of increased concentrations of GS-441524 were lost after 17 and 20 repeated passages, and only one lineage after 23 passages selected a low-level resistant mutant, conferring a 5.6-fold increase in the EC50\n[17]. Two amino acid substitutions (F467L and V553L) were noted in non-structural protein (nsp) 12, the RdRp of MHV, and also resulted in a 6-fold increase in the EC50 in SARS-CoV. However, the remdesivir-resistant MHV with F476L and V553L mutations was outcompeted by wild-type MHV in the absence of GS-5734, suggestive of the effect of remdesivir resistance on decreased viral fitness. Of note, in the mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, the remdesivir-resistant SARS-CoV-infected mice lost less weight and had a more evident decline in pulmonary viral loads by 4 days after infection than wild-type SARS-CoV-infected mice, indicative of attenuated pathogenicity of remdesivir-resistant SARS-CoV. The above findings indicate a high genetic barrier for remdesivir to develop resistance a well as decreased fitness and pathogenicity in remdesivir-resistant mutants, and further encourage the therapeutic potential of remdesivir in the treatment of newly emerging COVID-19.",

Although in the animal study the plasma half-life of remdesivir was short (0.39 h), remdesivir was rapidly distributed into PBMCs, converted into its active form within 2 h post-infusion, and had an intracellular half-life of 14 h. In the absence of any human pharmacokinetic information, such data from rhesus monkeys indicate that parenteral daily dosing of remdesivir may achieve sustained intracellular concentrations of nucleotide triphosphate, which are above its EC90 for SARS-CoV-2. These in vitro and animal data provide preliminary evidence supporting the clinical potential of remdesivir for human infections caused by contemporary and emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.",
