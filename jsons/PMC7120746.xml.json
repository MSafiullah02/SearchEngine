The nature of RT-PCR requires the synthesis of a cDNA by RT prior to its amplification in the PCR reaction. Thus, we focus on the three steps of RT-PCR: the preparation and requirements of the RNA template, the reverse transcription reaction, and the amplification of the cDNA by PCR.",

Depending on the source of the RNA template, a method of preparation should be chosen that minimizes degradation of the RNA.

Reverse transcription reactions have been performed using the RNase H-deficient reverse transcriptase, SuperScript II and the cDNA has been used for PCR amplification without further purification. In general, an RT-primer should be used that is highly specific and great care should be taken to adjust the optimal concentration of the RT-primer in the reverse transcription reaction. In our experience, the major problem that arises is less stringent priming during the RT reaction. The fortuitous cDNAs that are synthesized and the small amounts of RT-primer that are carried over into the PCR are responsible for most of the background amplification products observed (6).\n",

We recommend preparing the RNA from a confluent cell layer using at least one 175 cm2 tissue culture flask. This ensures that you will get enough poly(A)-containing RNA to perform several RT reactions using the same RNA preparation.There are different Magnetic Particle Concentrators recommended, depending on the size of the tubes. To lyse the cells and bind the RNA to the oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads, we use 15 mL tubes. Before we elute the poly(A)-containing RNA, we transfer the oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads into a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube.If the oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads appear to clump and do not resuspend well, you have cellular DNA in your sample. However, you can proceed without affecting the RNA quality or yield, if you perform additional washing steps (2-4) until the oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads can be resuspended easily.We strongly recommend analyzing the RNA template integrity before cDNA synthesis. We routinely perform a northern hybridization analysis. In Fig. 1 poly(A)-containing RNA prepared from HCoV 229E infected MRC-5 cells using two different methods are shown. In both RNA preparations, it is possible to identify the HCoV 229E genomic RNA (27.3 kb) and the six subgenomic mRNAs (1.7 kb-6.8 kb) that are characteristic of coronavirus infection. The hybridization analysis indicates that the material prepared using the oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads (lane 2) is less degraded than the material prepared using poly(U)-Sepharose (lane 1). RT-PCR amplifications of more than 5 kbp were only possible when poly(A)-containing RNA shown in lane 2 was used as the template for reverse transcription.The oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads can be regenerated according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions (Dynal). However, during the repeated washing steps, you will loose about 20% of the magnetic beads.Add the reagents in the order listed in Subheading 3.2. To melt RNA structures before the reverse transcription, some protocols recommend to heat the RNA for 10 min at 70\u00b0C. However, in most cases this is not necessary.Because the RT is performed at 42\u00b0C, cDNAs can be generated during the RT reaction by less stringent priming events. This is the reason for most of the background PCR products observed in our system. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to use a highly specific RT-primer and to adjust the optimal primer concentration in the RT-reaction (6). Furthermore, we recommend the use of different primers for the RT and PCR reactions.Before adding the SuperScript II enzyme, the RNA template and the RT-primer should be at42\u00b0C to minimize unspecific binding.We recommend incubation for 90 min when cDNA synthesis of more than 10 kb is desired. Increasing the incubation temperature above 42\u00b0C was not beneficial in our hands.Some protocols for the amplification of long mRNAs have required digestion of the RNA with RNase H after cDNA synthesis (11). This step did not seem to be necessary for amplification with HCoV 229E genomic RNA. This may be owing to the fact that in our protocols the HCoV 229E RNA was relatively abundant. Experiments with dystrophin mRNA required treatment with RNase H prior to amplification (6).The PCR cycle conditions have to be optimized according to the amount of template, the PCR primers and the cycle profile. We recommend that these parameters should be optimized with RT-PCRs of expected product sizes below 5 kbp before trying to synthesize longer RT-PCR products.This will result in a Mg2+concentration of 2 mM.Optional: a &quote;real&quote; hot start can be performed by adding the enzyme mix after the PCR sample has reached 94\u00b0C.\n",

The poly(A)-containing RNAs were separated by gel electrophoresis and the viral mRNAs were hybridized to a 32P-(5\u2032end)-labeled oligonucleotide (5\u2032AGAAACTTCTCACGCACTGG 3\u2032). Also shown is the relationship of the HCoV 229E genomic RNA template, oligonucleotide primers and RT-PCR products. The oligonucleotides are indicated as arrows with their orientation and position relative to the HCoV 229E genomic RNA. The expected sizes of the RT-PCR products are indicated.",
