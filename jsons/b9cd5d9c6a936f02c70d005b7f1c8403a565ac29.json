We can start growing disks around each point in the sample and consider the union of these disks. Initially when the radius \u03c1 of the disks are close to zero, we get a set of disconnected sets (Fig. 1a) . As we continue, we notice that at some particular radius \u03c1 = \u03c1 1 , a set with the same topology as the figure eight is obtained (Fig. 1b) . Upon increasing the radius further to \u03c1 = \u03c1 2 , the smaller of the two holes in the figure is completely filled while the other remains (Fig. 1c) . Further increasing \u03c1 = \u03c1 3 , fills up the larger hole as well (Figure 1d ), making the union of disks consist of a single connected component for all \u03c1 > \u03c1 3 . The next step is to look at the combinatorial information contained in the evolving unions of disks. We achieve this by constructing a filtered simplicial complex, a mathematical object consisting of vertices, edges, triangles, tetrahedra, and their higher dimensional analogues, called simplices, with information on when these are added to the complex. First we add a vertex for each point in the point cloud at time 0, then whenever two disks intersect, we add an edge. Every time three disks intersect, we add a triangle, and similarly we add higher dimensional simplices for higher order intersections. Therefore, we get a sequence of simplices. In this sequence, the topological persistence computation is a set of birth-death pairs of homology cycle classes that indicate when a class is born and when it dies. In the previous example, it indicates when the loops are formed and when they are filled up. The pair (birth,death] of these homology classes can be indicated as a sets of points in R 2 (called persistence diagrams; see [15] ) or as sets of horizontal lines (called persistence barcodes; see [9] ; illustrated in Fig. 1e ).",

In our example, Fig. 1e represents barcodes associated with Figs. 1a-d. In Fig. 1e (H 0 ) , we have many \u03b2 0 at the beginning, as observed in Fig. 1a which die as \u03c1 increases to connect the different components. In Fig. 1e (H 0 ) we have a red bar, which corresponds to the final connected component that lives forever. In Fig. 1e (H 1 ) , we notice two long bars, representing the two loops that are formed and then eventually filled up. The fact that one bar is longer than the other suggests the size of one hole greater than the other. Also, notice that these bars in H 1 appear up after the cycles in H 0 have died. In our data analysis using topological features, we wish to use these intervals in persistent homology to better understand the shape of the data. ",

Table 1 shows the F 1 score, true positive rate (TPR), and true negative rate (TNR) for our TDA approach as well as for baseline machine learning methods, on the task of predicting Parkinson's disease diagnosis. We included both micro-F 1 and macro-F 1 scores, the latter gives equal weight to each class to take into account class imbalance [31] . Our TDA with the convolutional neural network (TDA-CNN) approach achieved remarkable improvement of both microand macro-F 1 scores compared to the other methods. The TDA-CNN approach achieve scores above 0.87, while SVM (with two different kernel options) and random forest yield similar values to each other, up to 0.64 for micro-F 1 and 0.58 for macro-F 1 . Note that convolutional neural networks operate on two-dimensional image data, thus we chose a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) as a comparison on the RoDEO-processed gene expression vector data. For this data, the MLP-NN approach seems particularly ill suited, with scores 0.56 and 0.40 for micro-and macro-F 1 , respectively.",
