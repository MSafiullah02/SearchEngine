Currently, seven HAdV species (A\u2010G) have been identified and are classified in the genus Mastadenovirus of the family Adenoviridae.4 HAdV can infect a large variety of cell types and tissues in humans, leading to a broad array of diseases, including acute respiratory infections (ARI),5 febrile exudative tonsillitis,6 acute conjunctivitis,7 cystitis, gastroenteritis,4 and rare cases of encephalitis,8 myocarditis,9 and hepatitis.10 Although HAdV infections are generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, acute HAdV diseases have a significant impact on children (especially under 4 years of age), elderly, immunosuppressed individuals, and military recruits.4\n",

In fact, the cells types involved in the process of viral reactivation in vivo and the possible roles that HAdV replication may play in the development of chronic diseases, such as adenotonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis, is not entirely understood. The present cross\u2010sectional study of HAdV replication in adenotonsillar hypertrophy was conducted to help comprehend the association between viral replication in those tissues and shedding in secretions and the development of adenotonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis. Quantification of the HadV genome and the detection of mRNA of the HAdV hexon gene was performed in human adenoids and tonsils, NPS, and peripheral blood (PB) from patients with tonsillar hypertrophy and were compared to those obtained in samples from control patients.",

Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol. For antigen retrieval, the sections were treated with trypsin (0.05% in distilled water with 0.1% calcium chloride; pH 7.8) at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes. To detect HAdV antigen, the tissue sections were washed in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS), incubated for 1 hour in PBS with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 3% horse serum, and incubated for 2 hours with anti\u2010HAdV mouse monoclonal antibody (MAB8052; Millipore, Billerica, MA) diluted 1:1000 in PBS/BSA (pH 7.4) with 0.1% of Triton X\u2010100 (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with biotinylated horse antimouse IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:2000 in PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 minutes at room temperature.
