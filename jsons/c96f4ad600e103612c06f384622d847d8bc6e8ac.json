The agenda identified 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets intended to catalyse \"peace and prosperity for people and the planet\". Of the 17 goals, many address health indirectly (eg, zero hunger [SDG2], gender equality [SDG5], and clean water and sanitation [SDG6]), while SDG3 focuses directly on health, with the objective being to \"ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\" Substantial effort has been made to quantify the progress towards meeting the targets set in SDG3. 1,2 Examples include WHO's Thirteenth General Programme of Work, which provides a framework for tracking progress towards the health-related SDGs and research done by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors study (GBD) Collaborator Network, while less research has focused on tracking spending on SDG priority areas, especially how they relate to specific SDG3 indicators. 3 Tracking financial resources for SDG3 priority areas is crucial for two distinct reasons. First, any For SDG3 specifically, the Third Edition of the Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries assessed financial needs for universal health coverage, while researchers at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation have estimated funding gaps to achieve universal health coverage. The Department of Health Systems Governance and Financing at WHO has also projected resource needs to finance transformative health systems towards achievement of SDG3. Beyond estimated financing targets, needs, and gaps, only four of 27 SDG3 indicators have estimates of past or current total spending. These financial estimates are not directly comparable due to differences in study designs, scopes, and completeness.",

Monitoring this progress requires comparable and consistent estimates in financing for health. By providing these estimates, we create a foundation for stakeholders to discuss, set, and reach achievable financial goals. In particular, for some low-income countries our results highlight that the available resources seem insufficient to achieve the SDG3 targets by 2030. This study also highlights the need to estimate the financing available for the other SDG3 priority areas. Furthermore, the nuanced evidence on the scaleup of spending and improvements in health outcomes suggest a complex association between spending and health outcomes. This complexity highlights that, although more resources are probably needed to achieve SDG3, other constraints such as inefficient resource allocation, weak governance systems, inadequate health workforce, and drug shortages will likely need to be addressed to achieve the SDG3 targets. efficiency of health systems), knowing precisely how much is being spent and for what purpose is essential for tracking effectiveness and ensuring an equitable distribution of resources. Second, SDG3 target 3.8 identifies financial risk protection and access to essential services as key targets. 5 Financial risk protection is ensuring that no household endures financial hardship due to large spending on health. Achieving SDG3 target 3.8 not only requries enough resources are available to provide the services and interventions needed to prevent and treat ill health, but also that an awareness of the source of those funds is key. Ensuring that health spending does not lead to financial hardship and impoverishment, known as catastrophic health spending, requires that funds for health be prepaid and pooled across individuals via public or private insurance schemes. 6 The alternative to prepaid and pooled resources for health is reliance on out-of-pocket spending, which forces households without sufficient resources to choose between receiving health care or medical impoverishment.",

The objectives of this study are to measure spending on SDG3 priority areas where estimates are relatively complete and comparable, examine the association between outcomes and financings levels, and identify where resource shortages are most apparent for four SDG3 indicators. We quantified health spending for universal health coverage; domestic and DAH spending on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria; and DAH spending for reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health, tobacco control, non-communicable diseases, vaccines, and human resources. We also evaluated spending against key SDG3 indicators for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, universal health coverage, and pandemic preparedness. Additionally, this research estimates future spending on health up to 2030 and 2050 to highlight the expected resource availability and, in particular, provides information that can be used to identify where more prepaid and pooled resources are needed.",

Out-of-pocket health spending captures health-care spending by an individual patient or their household, excluding insurance premiums paid before needing care. Prepaid private-health spending includes non-governmental agency spending on health and private insurance. To estimate the three domestic health spending variables, we extracted data from the WHO Global Health Expenditure database for all available countries. 10 We downloaded the data in current national currency units, adjusted for inflation, and then converted to 2019 $US, completed our analysis, and then also converted our estimates into 2019 purchasing-power parity-adjusted $. We used deflator series and exchange rate data based on data from the International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook. 11 For each extracted datapoint, we used the metadata provided by WHO to qualitatively assess the quality of data. We assigned a weight to each downloaded datapoint on the basis of docu mented source information, completeness of metadata, and documented methods of estimation (more details are in the appendix [pp [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] ).

Disbursement of DAH funds to single countries were identified as such, while global initiatives and administrative costs were classified separately. Administrative costs capture the operational cost of running projects-eg, staff salaries. The research and development funds that are included in our DAH estimates are those that are disbursed through international development agencies with the primary intent of the improvement and maintenance of health in low-income and middle-income countries. The DAH contributions towards human resources we captured here include indirect funding for human resources activities, such as per diems, and direct funding for human resources for health projects that invest in human resources activities, such as training, education, and policy development. The health focus areas included in this study are HIV/AIDS; tuberculosis; malaria; reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health; other infectious disease; non-communicable diseases; sectorwide approaches; and health system strengthening. Detailed descriptions of the methods we used to isolate the disbursements of DAH funds for relevant health focus areas and preliminary estimates are in the appendix (pp 34-45) and elsewhere. 7, 15 The estimates presented here of DAH incorporated improvements in our methods compared with previous years, such as using additional project-level descriptions [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were eight development goals adopted by the UN in 2000. The goals, to be achieved by 2015, included the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; achievement of universal primary enrolment; promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women; reduction in child mortality, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; and improvement in maternal health. Like the SDGs, the MDGs included health specific goals and goals focused on other sectors indirectly linked to health. In our analyses, we examine spending over the duration of the MDGs, starting in 2000 up to 2015.",

We report spending estimates for Venezuela in 2014 US$ because necessary exchange rates for more recent years were not reliable. We evaluated health spending against key indicators relative to SDG3. In particular, we extracted estimates of incidence of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria from GBD 2017, 22 and the universal health coverage service coverage index. 1, 23 We used different measures to report findings from our spending and outcomes analyses. For HIV/AIDS, we report spending per prevalent case, because a lot of HIV/AIDS spending is determined by the number of people undergoing treatment. For malaria, we report spending per capita, because as countries move towards elimination a lot of malaria spending is on surveillance. For tuberculosis, we report spending per incident case, because a lot of tuberculosis spending is determined by detection of incident cases. Population estimates, both retrospective and prospective were also extracted from the GBD 2017 study. 24 We analysed the association between universal health coverage service index and pooled health spending by calculating the annualised rate of change in each metric from 2000 up to 2017. For our financial risk protection analysis, we used the estimates of catastrophic health spending and report catastrophic health spending estimates from the World Bank World Development Indicators database. We divided the extracted estimates by total domestic spending on health and then regressed on national income using loess regression methods. Annualised rate of change is only calculated for countries For more on the Millennium Development Goals see https://www.undp.org/content/ undp/en/home/sdgoverview/ mdg_goals.html with more than 1 year of catastrophic health spending estimates and when catastrophic health spending was greater than zero. 25, 26 We report estimates of DAH from 1990 up to 2019 for low-income and middle-income countries. The data for 2018 and 2019 are preliminary estimates based on budget data and estimation. We compared DAH contributions over two periods: 2000 up to 2015 and 2015 up to 2019. We also analysed DAH by Argentina is the only country in the World Bank category of lowincome and middle-income countries to fall in the GBD high-income super-region; hence, in the present study we do not include Argentina, and its GBD super-region, in figures that disaggregate by GBD super-region. We report aggregate rates that reflect the group of countries or region as a whole, rather than a mean across the countries in that group or region. We did all analyses using R (version 3.6.0) and Stata (version 15). All spending estimates used in this analysis are publicly available on the Global Health Data Exchange website.",

Our analysis quantified health sector spending and health spending on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria relative to outcomes, which are all priorities under SDG3. We also examined future availability of resources for health. Our results highlight that, globally, total health spending has increased since the state of the SDGs in 2015, reaching $7\u00b79 trillion (7\u00b78-8\u00b70) in 2017, and is expected to increase to $11\u00b70 trillion (10\u00b77-11\u00b72) by 2030, although with substan tial disparity across countries. In 2017, in lowincome and middle-income countries, an estimated $20\u00b72 billion was spent on HIV/AIDS, $10\u00b79 billion was spent on tuberculosis, and $5\u00b71 billion was spent on malaria in endemic countries.

Although these financing goals can be benchmarks to encourage more spending and increased health system efficiency, they do not ensure that SDG3 will be achieved. Ultimately, costing estimates like these need to be continuously improved to make them locally relevant and price appropriate, with realistic assumptions about health system inefficiency and the distribution of spending in a country, and to incorporate any challenges associated with preventing and treating disease in difficult to reach contexts.",

Governments contribute substantially across all three diseases. This observation is important because domestic resource mobilisation has received renewed interest as a key strategy for gener ating resources to finance the SDGs. 4 While DAH contributions to malaria and HIV/AIDS are substantial, contributions to tuberculosis are smaller. This pattern brings into light longstanding concerns and debate regarding the allocation of DAH especially across health focus areas. [41] [42] [43] These concerns and debate include whether the current criteria that rely mainly on a country's level of development are the most appro priate to use for allocation, donor preference for implementing vertical programmes with short-term measurable effects, and prioritisation of such diseases to broader health system challenges. Also, the relative dependence on household out-of-pocket spending across the three diseases is notable, with the proportion of out-of-pocket spending for tuberculosis and malaria being much larger than the proportion for HIV/AIDS. Changes in policy, such as making HIV treatment available and free to all, has transformed management of care for HIV/AIDS and its by-source funding distribution. Previous studies have shown that high out-of-pocket spending promotes health impoverishment. 17, 44, 45 Hence, targeted efforts, such as public education campaigns on enrolment in national health insurance or free provision of services where appropriate, aimed at increasing the share of national health spending that is financed through pooled resources might improve financial protection. The distribution of health spending by source across different regions also highlights heterogeneous health financing patterns for the three diseases globally. For some geographical regions (eg, Central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa), governments carry the primary burden of providing resources for these diseases, while in other regions (eg, southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, and south Asia) the pattern of financing changes with the type of disease. Similarly, health spending globally has distinct patterns. In the high-income GBD super-region, spending by governments dominates, while in other super-regions, such as south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, DAH and out-of-pocket spending are prominent. Preferably, resources for financing health care should be pooled to restrict the risk of health impoverishment for the population and delays in accessing needed care. Resources for financing health care could be pooled through government facilitation of the development of viable prepaid mandatory insurance programmes.",

Our results highlight a nuanced and complex picture regarding the link between health spending and its associated effect on outcomeshere, disease-specific outcomes. Although substantial reductions in the inci dence of some diseases were observed as spending increased in some countries, in others decreases in the inci dence of other disease were minimal or even increases in incidence were seen. For example, for malaria, we observed that in Myanmar and eSwatini, per-capita spending increased at an annualised rate of more than 15% from 2000 to 2017, and the annualised incidence rate decreased by more than 10%, while for tuberculosis, in eSwatini, Lesotho, and Nicaragua, we observed a more than 12% annualised rate of growth in per-capita spending with varying annualised rates of change in incidence (0\u00b789% decrease for eSwatini, 0\u00b704% increase for Lesotho, 2\u00b714% decrease for Nicaragua). Because these findings are not causal, interest in understanding this link between spending on health and health outcomes is strong and more efforts would be needed to understand the drivers of success.",

Although donor contributions will be necessary to meet spending targets in some low-income countries, governments were an important source of funding in the broader health system and among the three disease areas for which data were available. For most middle-income countries, the aspiration is that national economic growth will also bolster what resources are allocated to the health sector by the government. Further more, although DAH will continue to be needed in some low-income countries, a continued need for and value in DAH provision to cover so-called global public goods or common goods for health exists (such as pandemic preparedness or research and development for neglected tropical diseases). 35, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] This continued need is because the multisectoral nature of the SDGs and the increasingly interconnected world we live in present shared global challenges that need to be addressed beyond the individual country support framework that DAH has typically addressed.",

The comparison of the annualised rates of change of pooled health spending per capita and universal health cov erage index highlighted some of the best performers at each level of development. For example, Myanmar and Georgia show annualised growth in per-capita-pooled spending of more than 13%, which was associated with 2\u00b714% annualised growth in universal health coverage index in Myanmar and 0\u00b705% in Georgia. Peer-to-peer country learning might facilitate the transfer of best practices in both the delivery and administration of the health sector in countries that are not yet performing optimally with their available resources. The second annual Universal Health Coverage Financing Forum organised by the World Bank high lighted strategies such as strategic purchasing, improve ment in data management systems, and organisational management that can be adopted to promote better efficiency for health. 53 However, while important health gains can probably be made by increasing efficiency and investing in allied sectors, our future health spending estimates indicate that spending is expected to remain low in many countries, which raises concerns about the viability of reaching crucial SDG3 goals in those countries. In such countries, additional efforts to mobilise revenue, such as tax reforms where appropriate, are needed to ensure that adequate resources are available to support the achievement of the SDG3 goals.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, the data we used reported using different research units for each SDG3 indicator. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria spending estimates were available for a subset of total countries. As such, although the available data is meaningful and contributes to our knowledge of spending on the SDGs, a directly comparable analysis of global spending inclusive of all countries on these indicators is currently constrained by gaps in the available data. Also, multiple competing cost estimates exist, and so the existing financing targets that we found for comparison with our spending estimates often differed in geographical scope, methods, and currency. These comparisons require precise and contextspecific costing estimates that incorporate realistic levels of efficacy. Second, some of the input data on global health spending used to generate total health spending estimates had questionable annual growth trends or did not provide direct information about the sources of the data. We used modelling methods to enable incorporation of these data but we acknowledge that challenges exist in terms of the quality of the available global health spending data. Additionally, we provided UIs for the estimates to provide information on the quality and precision of the estimates generated. Third, while the use of keywords to isolate relevant health focus and pro gramme areas for our DAH analysis is the best existing strategy for a comprehensive effort, it relies heavily on the project description provided in the databases and in some instances might not accurately reflect what the funds actually contributed to. Fourth, presenting spending at disease level might not be the level of aggregation that is most relevant for ministries of health and disaggregating at facility level (primary, secondary, and tertiary) or at expenditure-item level (staff, commodities) might be more readily useful to them. We plan to provide estimates that include these levels of disaggregation in the near future. Notably, our analysis of spending and outcomes was not designed to detect causality, but was primarily a descriptive analysis of the associations between these two metrics. Therefore, our findings should not be interpreted as causal. Fifth, when forecasting health expenditures, we are unable to incorporate fundamentally new and different policies or innovations that are outside of the bounds of the observed data. Current estimates do not directly account for mass migration due to conflict and are only able to be incorporated on the basis of these events being reflected in the underlying covariates.",

Ideally, estimates on DAH and domestic spending on all the priority areas under SDG3 will provide a more comprehensive picture.
