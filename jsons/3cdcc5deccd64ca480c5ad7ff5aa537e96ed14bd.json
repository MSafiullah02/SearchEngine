Second, while CDC and other experts were consulted to determine a conservative estimate for when the case was most likely to become infectious, we cannot confirm if/when COVID-19 illness onset began. It was challenging to characterize illness onset in this patient, when the only symptom (mild nonproductive cough) began prior to exposure to COVID-19 and remained unchanged during and after diagnosis. Third, although 10 of 11 contacts with high-risk exposure were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 1 contact with high-risk exposure and 5 contacts with medium-risk exposure did not have specimens tested and we cannot rule out that viral transmission occurred in these contacts. Lastly, no viral culture data exists to evaluate viral viability in this patient.",

Ct values in specimens collected after symptom resolution, on illness days 12, 14, 16, 18, and 22, were >35, suggesting decreasing levels of virus in these specimens. On February 5, the patient reported his cough had resolved. On February 19, 14 days after symptom resolution, CDC confirmed the patient's nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 at 2 consecutive time points \u226524 hours apart and he was released from voluntary isolation.",
