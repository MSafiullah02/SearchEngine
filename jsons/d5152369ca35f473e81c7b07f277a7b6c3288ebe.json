CPV-2a and CPV-2b were reported in 1979 and 1984 , with unique amino acid residues as 426N and 426D, respectively. Both CPV-2a and CPV-2b variants are distributed worldwide and infect both dogs and cats but exhibit low pathogenicity in cats (Clegg et al., 2012) . In 1990, CPV-2a and CPV-2b were replaced by two new variants of CPV-2a (CPV-2a-297A) and CPV-2b (CPV-2b-297A), with one unique amino acid substitution, S297A (Decaro et al., 2009) . In 2000, CPV-2c was first reported in Italy with one substitution at the VP2 gene (D426E) (Buonavoglia et al., 2001) . Recently, has been circulating predominantly in Europe and the Americas (Decaro & Buonavoglia, 2012) . CPV-2c has also been reported in Asia, including cases in China, India, Taiwan and Vietnam (Chiang, Wu, Chiou, Chang, & Lin, 2016; Nakamura et al., 2004; Nandi, Chidri, Kumar, & Chauhan, 2010; Zhao et al., 2016) . It has also been reported that CPV-2c can cause severe diseases in cats (Miranda, Parrish, & Thompson, 2014; Nakamura et al., 2001) . In",

The viral DNA was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until used. PCR assay for parvovirus identification was conducted as previously described (Buonavoglia et al., 2001) . The oligonucleotide primers specific to the VP2 gene were Hfor: 5\u2032-CAGGTGATGAATTGCTACA-3\u2032 and Hrev: 5\u2032-CATTTGGATAAACTGGTG GT-3\u2032, located at positions 3556-3575 and 4166-4185 of CPV-2, respectively. In brief, PCR was performed in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl comprising 1 \u03bcl of DNA, 0.8 \u03bcM of each forward and reverse primer, 1\u00d7 TopTaq Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 1\u00d7 CoralLoad, and distilled water. The PCR condition was set as initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 3 min 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 45 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The expected size of parvovirus positive amplified product was 611 bp. Identification of CPV2 antigenic variants was performed by using PCR-RFLP to differentiate CPV-2c and CPV-2a/CPV-2b variants. The PCR product size was 583 bp of the coding capsid protein VP2. Then, the PCR product was digested with enzyme Mbo II (New England Biolabs, USA) that selectively recognizes the restriction site \"GAAGA\" (nucleotide 4062-4066 of the VP2 encoding gene). The CPV-2c was digested into two fragments of 500 bp and 83 bp (Buonavoglia et al., 2001) . The negative samples from CPV-2c PCR-RFLP assay were detected for CPV-2a and CPV-2b variants with specific primers (CPV-2abF/ CPV-2abR and CPV-2bF/CPV-2bR) generating the product size of 681 bp and 427 bp, respectively (Pereira, Leal, & Durigon, 2007; Pereira, Monezi, Mehnert, D'Angelo, & Durigon, 2000) ( Table S1 ). Concurrently, the CPV-2a/CPV-2b samples were confirmed by sequencing of the flanking region at amino acid position 426 to identify CPV-2a or CPV-2b variants.",

The criteria for selecting these 34 viruses for genetic characterization were based on epidemiological and demographic data, such as age of dog, date of isolation, breed and vaccination history.

In brief, the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acids of Thai-CPVI G U R E 1 Phylogenetic tree of VP2 gene of canine parvovirus type 2 and feline parvovirus. Circles and squares represent Thai-CPV-2 and FPV, respectively. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the Beast program with Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC), with 10,000,000 generations and an average standard deviation of split frequencies <0.10. Values on branches represent times of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) among CPV-2 antigenic types [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 300, 305, 321, 323, 324, 370, 371, 375) was conducted by the alignment of VP2 by using MEGA v6.06 and MegAlign software v.5.03 (DNASTAR Inc.). For the phylogenetic analysis, the partial VP2 gene sequences of Thai-CPV-2 and FPV were analysed with those of reference viruses. Vaccine and reference viruses, including CPV-2-vaccine strains (n = 3), CPV-2 (n = 2), CPV-2a (n = 3), CPV-2b (n = 3), CPV-2c (n = 14), CPV-2a-297A (n = 11), CPV-2b-297A (n = 7), FPV vaccine (n = 3), FPV-G1 (n = 9), FPV-G2 (n = 1) and FPV-G3 (n = 3), were included in the phylogenetic analysis. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree of partial VP2 gene was constructed by BEAST 1.8 with the Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) algorithm. A strict clock model with coalescent constant population and HKY with gamma 4 substitution were used as model parameters (Drummond, Suchard, Xie, & Rambaut, 2012). The Bayesian MCMC chain lengths were 10,000,000 generations, with sampling every 10,000 generations. The tree iteration was discharged with 10% of the chains as burn-in pattern by using a tree annotator, and the resulting MCC tree was drawn with FigTree software (v1.4.2) (Molecular evolution, phylogenetics and epidemiology, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK) (Figure 1). To determine the selective pressure on the partial VP2 (nucleotide positions 817-1314, amino acid positions 274-428), the ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions was estimated using Mixed Effects Model of Evolution (MEME) within the HyPhy software package(Murrell et al., 2012). The significance levels were set at p = 0.1. The values dN/dS > 1, dN/dS = 1 and dN/dS < 1 were used to define positive selection, neutral mutations, and negative selection, respectively. A phylogenetic tree was also constructed by using maximum-likelihood with bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replications using the MEGA v.6.06 program (Tamura, Dudley, Nei, & Kumar, 2007) (Figure S1).",

The estimated nucleotide substitution rate of the partial VP2 was 1.1905 \u00d7 10 \u22124 substitutions per site per year. 95% highest posterior densities (HPD) was 6.9511 \u00d7 10 \u22125 -1.6877 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). It is noted that the new variant CPV-2b-297A (n = 2) was clustered in a separate group in which one isolate (Dog/CU-20139) was closely related to the vaccine strain (CPV-2b/Vaccine), suggesting a virus of vaccine origin. The phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 gene of FPV was also performed, showing that Thai-FPV was predominantly clustered with FPV-G1 (n = 10), including one canine isolate (Dog/CU-17).

Our analysis suggested that the estimated time of the most recent common ancestor of Thai-CPV-2c subclusters was 2004 (Figure 1). The substitution rate of parvovirus in this study was in agreement with other studies (1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 -2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 substitutions per site per year)(Hoelzer, Shackelton, Parrish, & Holmes, 2008;Pereira et al., 2007;Shackelton, Parrish, Truyen, & Holmes, 2005). Moreover, our data indicated that parvovirus (which is DNA virus) has high genomic substitution rate similar to other RNA viruses at approximately 10 \u22124 substitutions per site per year(Duffy, Shackelton, & Holmes, 2008).Whole genome analysis indicated that Thai-CPVs are closely related to Asian-CPV-2c with unique amino acids at position 297A, 370R and 426E of VP2, suggesting predominant Asian-CPV-2c in the country. It is also noted that unique amino acid substitutions at positions Y324I and Q370R were only observed in Asian strains of CPV-2c. These unique amino acids (370R) might relate to receptorbinding properties, suggesting species preference. Recent observations have also been reported in China and Taiwan (Chiang et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2013). The identification of several types of CPV2 (CPV-2c, new variant CPV-2a-297A, and new variant CPV-2b-297A) demonstrates diversity of CPV2 in Thailand. CPV-2c is an emerging variant in the country and the Southeast Asia region. These findings will stimulate concern regarding whether currently used canine parvovirus vaccines will provide full protection against the new variant, Asian-CPV-2c. In summary, our results demonstrated the emergence of the new variant Asian-CPV-2c in dogs and cats in Thailand. Since cats can be infected with CPV-2c, dogs can also be infected with FPV. Thus, veterinary practitioners should focus more attention on both CPV and FPV infections, especially interspecies transmission. In Thailand, the surveillance of CPV and FPV should be further conducted on a larger scale to determine the dynamics of predominant variants and their distributions. This information will aid early diagnosis and the development of future strategies for domestic animal vaccination.",
