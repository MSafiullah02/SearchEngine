His respiratory capacity deteriorated and he was taken to the Emergency Unit of a specialized centre in Milan where he was connected to a ventilator. He eventually succumbed to the disease that initially was unnamed and that we now know as the consequence of COVID-19 infection.",

A few days ago, while going to work, I met the caretaker of our building and had a chat with him: he mentioned to me that he and other inhabitants of the building felt safer because I was there and could help in case of emergency or just try to explain what was going on and, above all, make predictions as to the end of this situation or at least regarding its improvement. This role, our role is, of course, also important at home, with family members, with friends and sometimes with just bystanders. We have to champion the scientific approach: discourage the idea that COVID-19 is the result of a conspiracy, or even of bad science; trust in laboratory work (and, yes, animal experiments too!) aimed at identifying a vaccine (by the way, everyone who was anti-vax has strangely disappeared just recently); provide understandable explanations on numbers and graphs that each day are submerging us, from whatever source, be it the television, newspapers the web or the social media.",

We did good things in Lombardy but we also made mistakes, and we and others will hopefully learn from these mistakes. One for all: avoid transforming hospitals into the problem rather than the remedy. Hospitalize patients that really need it and, above all, check all the operators with swabs, even if asymptomatic. They might be so because of their immune system, which for reasons now unknown is particularly fit to fight COVID-19, but the contagion to other unfit bystanders could become dangerous, even lethal. And now that the number of infected people may be platooning (here, of course), we need to set up reliable assays to determine IgM and IgG levels in the peripheral blood of people exposed to the virus.
