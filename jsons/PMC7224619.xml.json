As of this writing, there are nearly 450,000 confirmed cases and >14,000 deaths in the United States, with confirmed cases surpassing 1.5 million worldwide.1 But other diseases, like firearm injuries, continue unabated. At best, interpersonal violence is taking place at baseline rates; at worst, violence is escalating. And it feels that way to all of us working in urban trauma centers. Recent data support this observation. In Philadelphia, there were 141 shootings in March, making it Philadelphia's worst March for gun violence in 5 years. During the first 10 days alone of Philadelphia's \u201cStay At Home\u201d order, there were 52 shooting victims in the city (Fig. 1).2",

There is concern over the effect that \u201cStay At Home\u201d orders may have on domestic violence; indeed, the risk of death among victims of domestic abuse is increased 5-fold with a gun in the home.7",

We might have hypothesized a month ago that \u201cStay At Home\u201d orders would reduce firearm violence, but we have seen the opposite in our community and remain concerned about the potential for increases in the volume of intimate partner violence and child abuse victims that we see.

With the strain on resources and uncertainty of COVID-19 status in patients that cannot be screened (eg, intubated patients or those with depressed mental status), our institution has dedicated part of the trauma bay for these patients. Rapid testing is used before transfer to the intensive care unit\u2014if clinically appropriate\u2014to triage patients to negative pressure rooms and COVID-19 dedicated units in an attempt to reduce exposures. N95 masks are now standard for all trauma resuscitations and aero-digestive procedures. Although presently we are fortunate enough to have adequate PPE at a time when shortages have become a national issue, conservation of equipment is imperative. We reuse items when appropriate, carefully plan procedures so as to limit entrances and exits from a patient's room, and limit the number of providers participating in procedures to the minimum possible. An increase in the volume of violence also increases the need for PPE use. Now is the time for national guidelines and best practices for trauma systems around the country in the context of a pandemic. We must keep our workforce healthy and able to care for all patients for the long haul.",

Standardized guidelines based on an institution's supply are beneficial and need to be continuously updated. Although we are all inclined to continue to provide operative care to patients in need, we must be exceptionally prudent and operate on only those patients with life-threatening problems. Our health system has put in place a requirement that all nonemergent cases require \u201cjustification\u201d from the attending surgeon as part of the scheduling process. We applaud this change and urge others to do the same. As this pandemic progresses, it may force us into the uncomfortable position of weighing maximum public health benefit against individual patient benefit. Difficult decisions may have to be made at the institution level regarding allocation of scarce resources like blood products, ventilators, and advanced therapies like extracorporeal membranous oxygenation.",

Although distancing measures will undoubtedly mitigate the viral epidemic, we cannot allow it to exacerbate the violence epidemic. The fact that violence has persisted in Philadelphia despite orders to stay home may say something about the risk/benefit calculus in our trauma patients. Although many people are consumed by the fear of virus transmission, for some, this risk pales in comparison to the baseline risk of community violence and is superseded by the need to carry on with everyday activities for survival. Isolating and abandoning society's most vulnerable members will only trade one cause of mortality for another. Access to social services must be maintained. Economic and emotional stressors need to be minimized. We cannot lose sight of the fact that all gun injuries are preventable. Our country's social safety net is needed now more than ever.",
