The federal government has generally provided information in both official languages during the outbreak, for example by using simultaneous interpretation. However, as the situation became more urgent, a gradual easing of language restrictions has occurred. After stocks of sanitizing products were depleted, Health Canada lifted bilingual labeling regulations to allow materials featuring English-only instructions to be distributed (Fortin-Gauthier, 2020). Five weeks later, this directive was extended to apply to all cleaning products. English has been the primary language of the Prime Minister's daily briefings, unequally supplemented by French (Vachet, 2020). He also addressed children of the nation in English only, once on March 22 (Tang, 2020) and then on April 5 (CBC, 2020). Official Languages Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly, who is on the emergency response task force, has been mum about these deviations to the norm. Commissioner of Official Languages Raymond Th\u00e9berge has recently spoken out, reminding the federal government that upholding its language obligations during the outbreak was \u201ca matter of respect and safety for all Canadians,\u201d and announcing that he would publish a special report on the federal government's respect of the OLA in its response to the COVID-19 crisis (OCOL, 2020).",

The French Language Services Act does not require the provincial government to provide all of its communications in both French and English. However, in 2010, the Treasury Board adopted the Communications in French Directive, following lessons learned from the H1N1 outbreak after French-language documentation had not been distributed. This directive mandates all provincial ministries and agencies to \u201cconsider the Francophone community's specific needs\u201d and to \u201cincorporate appropriate approaches into the communications activities, to reach Francophone audiences effectively\u201d (Government of Ontario, 2010). In this respect, the province has not fulfilled its duties. Until the third week of April, daily briefings were held in English only (Gratton, 2020). Written documentation was made available in French hours after publication in English, and there have been delays in posting information in French regarding COVID-19 on the Ontario.ca website. Associate Ombudsman of Ontario Kelly Burke has received complaints about these discrepancies (Carolino, 2020).",

Canada's only officially bilingual province, New Brunswick adopted legislation in 1981 recognizing the equality of the French- and English-language communities\u2014an act which was entrenched in the constitution in 1993. Perhaps because of these enhanced obligations, linguistic shortcomings in the government response to COVID-19 have been felt more acutely. Despite the availability of simultaneous interpretation during briefings, Premier Blaine Higgs has not made use of the service, and has occasionally refused to answer questions fielded by Francophone reporters (Gravel, 2020). Commissioner of Official Languages Shirley MacLean noted that \u201cthe [New Brunswick] Official Languages Act applies to institutions, not to elected representatives\u201d (Gravel, 2020; personal translation). However, New Brunswick's linguistic obligations may be unfulfilled by simultaneous interpretation, rather requiring a French-language interlocutor to provide equal services to both linguistic communities, in the spirit of section 16.1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Radio-Canada, 2020).",

It was translated into English and distributed in paper form several weeks later (Montreal Gazette, 2020).

As previously stated, some governments have relied on simultaneous interpretation or closed captioning of briefings relayed on electronic platforms. Yet these are not accessible to all citizens, notably in rural or remote areas. Some argue that since the rate of bilingualism is higher among Francophones in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2017), everyone should understand the guidelines circulated in English. However, French unilingualism is common, especially among the elderly, and English\u2013French bilingualism is often self-evaluated. Francophones tend to overstate their capacity in English in surveys or during interactions with state institutions (Deveau et al., 2009; Tardif and Dallaire, 2010). Therefore, in order to ensure proper understanding of daily directives, access to information in French is paramount. There is anecdotal evidence that French speakers outside of Quebec watch the Quebec briefings to access information in French (Liberal Party of Ontario, 2020). This may prompt citizens to comply with Quebec's guidelines, rather than those of their own province, which could have public safety (and legal) implications.",

Language barriers when receiving health services can have adverse effects on a patient (Bowen, 2015), such as errors in diagnosis and inadequate subsequent treatment. They can also lead to health promotion and education resources being underused. These risks are higher for vulnerable members of society, among whom are the elderly (OFLSC, 2016). As we know, COVID-19 disproportionately affects seniors, who make up a comparatively larger proportion of the Francophone population in minority communities compared to the majority and who have a low level of literacy, making it harder for them to navigate the health system (Bouchard and Desmeules, 2017). Also, second-language proficiency decreases with age, and stressful conditions and cognitive issues such as dementia are aggravating factors (OFLSC, 2018). It is thus imperative that this segment of the population receive information on COVID-19 in its mother tongue. Some of these observations are also valid for recent Francophone immigrants outside of Qu\u00e9bec.",
