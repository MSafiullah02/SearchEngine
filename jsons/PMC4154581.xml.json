            "text": "Defining mechanisms of viral persistence will be critical for understanding vector borne flavivirus infections. These viral infections account for considerable human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Furthermore, incidence is increasing and infections are being appreciated in previously nonendemic geographic locations. Prominent vector borne flaviviruses (VBFVs) associated with significant human infections include both tick borne and mosquito borne agents. The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFVs) are exemplified by the tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) sero complex group, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Alkhurma virus, Powassan virus (POWV), and deer tick virus (DTV), the latter two occurring in the United States (Holbrook et al., 2005; Brackney et al., 2008b; Ebel, 2010). The mosquito borne flaviviruses (MBFVs) are perhaps better known and include yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and dengue virus (DENV) serotypes 1\u20134. Infections with all of these viruses can lead to severe disease, prolonged debilitating neurological sequelae, hemorrhagic fever, and/or death in some cases (Solomon et al., 1998; Glass et al., 2002; Haglund & Gunther, 2003; Madden, 2003; Van Gerpen, 2003; Carson et al., 2006).",

Both TBFVs and MBFVs are cycled between arthropod and vertebrate hosts (Figs 1 and 2), and in many cases, they are maintained without deleterious effects on the hosts. In nature, TBFVs, such as POWV and TBEV, alternately infect small vertebrates such as rodents, hares, some carnivores, and a range of hard bodied (ixodid) ticks, although recent evidence suggests that the soft bodied Ornithodoros (argasid) ticks can also support TBFV (Rajagopalan et al., 1969; Charrel et al., 2007). Similarly, MBFVs, such as WNV and JEV, primarily alternate in nature between small mammals, birds, and mosquitoes (Fig. 1). In addition, there is evidence that MBFV and TBFV persistence also occurs in humans, and persistence in cell culture is well documented (Poidinger et al., 1991; Lancaster et al., 1998; Bugrysheva et al., 2001; Farfan Ale et al., 2009; Murray et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Although the hosts for the VBFVs are highly varied, the genomic and structural organization of the viruses themselves is remarkably similar. All flaviviruses are spherical, enveloped particles that contain a genome of (+) ssRNA measuring approximately 11 kb. The genome also functions as mRNA and encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved into 10 proteins (Table 1). Reasonable progress has been made toward understanding how these viruses replicate (Chambers et al., 1990; Mandl, 2005; Miorin et al., 2008; Tuplin et al., 2011; Pierson & Diamond, 2012; Brinton, 2013; Pierson & Kielian, 2013). We present a simplified overview of the general aspects of a VBFV replication cycle in Fig. 3. The individual proteins are three structural proteins: capsid (C), precursor membrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 (Chambers et al., 1990; Ryan et al., 1998; Bollati et al., 2010). The defined functions of these proteins are presented in Table 1. However, the precise function of some of the proteins remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, it should be noted that the bulk of the studies have been carried out in MBFV systems, and it is possible that the functions may not be identical in TBFV.",

The establishment of flavivirus persistence in humans seems to be mainly associated with encephalitic flaviviruses (Diamond, 2003). However, YFV and DENV persistence has been described in eukaryotic cells in culture and in successive generations of Aedes mosquitoes (Lodge et al., 1987; Takasaki et al., 2001; Farfan Ale et al., 2009).

The first phase is characterized by a flu like illness with symptoms such as headache, arthralgia, and malaise. The second phase may present with neurological symptoms, such as mild meningitis to severe encephalitis. Survivors of encephalitis may develop persistent neurological sequelae, suggesting neurological tissue damage and/or viral persistence. Neurological tissue damage, such as loss of neurons, has been reported for WNV infection (Guarner et al., 2004). Long term morbidity following TBEV infection is known to occur frequently (Haglund et al., 1996; Haglund & Gunther, 2003). A study conducted in Sweden reported chronic postencephalitic syndrome in 36% of patients who had been infected with TBEV (Haglund et al., 1996). In up to 60% of patients who develop encephalitis due to WNV infection, neurological and/or neuropsychological symptoms continue to be reported for up to 7 years following the infection (Murray et al., 2010; Sadek et al., 2010).",

Several reports describe the isolation of infectious VBFVs from persistently infected humans. For example, the Siberian TBEV strain Za was isolated from an individual who had harbored the virus for 10 years (Gritsun et al., 2003). He later died following 2 years of a progressive form of TBEV encephalitis (Gritsun et al., 2003). In addition, isolation of JEV from the cerebrospinal fluid was possible for more than 3 weeks following infection in 19% of individuals that had developed encephalitis (Ravi et al., 1993). JEV persistence was also demonstrated in peripheral mononuclear cells in infected children in northern India (Sharma et al., 1991). In these children, virus could be isolated by culture 8\u20139 months after acute infection (Sharma et al., 1991). Furthermore, WNV has been transmitted to patients who had received blood transfusions or organ transplants from asymptomatic donors (Pealer et al., 2003; Montgomery et al., 2006; CDC, 2009), suggesting viral persistence in the donors as well as stored blood for transfusion.",

Using TMA, WNV RNA was detectable in the blood of donors for up to 104 days following the index donation (Busch et al., 2008; Prince et al., 2008). Using RT PCR, WNV RNA could also be detected in urine of persistently infected individuals for up to 6.5 years following the acute phase of infection (Murray et al., 2010), although virus could not be isolated from the RNA positive urine samples. In contrast, WNV RNA could not be detected after 6 years in urine in another study reported a year later (Gibney et al., 2011). Baty and colleagues also failed to detect WNV RNA by RT PCR, but were able to detect viral RNA using TMA (Baty et al., 2012). Similarly for JEV, viral RNA could not be detected by RT PCR in the individuals who had anti JEV IgM antibodies (Zhao et al., 2013). In the study by Gibney et al. (2011), WNV persistence could not be excluded. Even though the results in these studies are somewhat variable, it seems reasonable to conclude that the presence of viral RNA can also be taken as an indicator of persistent infection.",

            "text": "Viral serology may be an additional surrogate measure for VBFV persistence. In general, infection or vaccination leads to a sterilizing immunity, but long term persistence of anti VBFV IgM antibodies has often been assumed to indicate continued exposure to viral antigens or virus particles (Ravi et al., 1993; Stiasny et al., 2012). An exception to this is, of course, DENV where antiviral antibody plays a key role in pathogenesis (Martina et al., 2009; Pierson, 2010). IgM antibodies induced by flaviviruses, such as TBEV and WNV, are known to persist in serum and CSF for 12 months or more (Kapoora et al., 2004; Stiasny et al., 2012). Indeed, IgM antibodies against TBEV persisted for up to 32 months (Stiasny et al., 2012). Furthermore, anti WNV IgM antibodies persist in previously exposed blood donors for up 16 months (Busch et al., 2008; Prince et al., 2008). However, IgM antibody persistence does not necessarily correlate with infectious virus persistence. For example, persistent IgM antibodies against TBEV can be detected in some cases following vaccination without active viral infection (Rendi Wagner et al., 2004; Stiasny et al., 2012). For WNV infection, IgM antibodies against the nonstructural protein NS5 cannot be used to distinguish between recent/active infection from past infection (Prince et al., 2008). Thus, serology may be a less useful marker for viral persistence.",

As flavivirus persistence seems to be mainly associated with the neurotropic and encephalitogenic viruses, the central nervous system may well be the preferred site for viral persistence. Furthermore, this may account for why patients who recover from encephalitis often have prolonged neurological symptoms. However, other studies by Murray and colleagues postulated kidneys as a preferred site for the establishment of persistent flavivirus infections following the detection of WNV RNA in urine (Murray et al., 2010). Certainly, additional work is required to define the true incidence, the biology, and the pathogenic potential in humans of persistent VBFV infections.",

The persistence of the TBFVs in arachnids is well established, and the role of ticks as long term reservoirs and vectors for the viruses is clear. Estimates suggest that ticks transmit about 25% of the known flaviviruses. TBFVs are capable of infecting about 14 tick species, but the ixodid ticks, Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes ricinus, account for nearly all transmission of TBEV to humans. Ixodes cookei may also harbor POWV and DTV, while the soft bodied Onithodoros tick transmits Alkhurma virus (Main et al., 1979; Charrel et al., 2007). To transmit virus, these ticks need only 15 min of attachment to the host (Crowder et al., 2013). The virus is present in the tick salivary glands, and saliva constituents enhance infectivity (Nuttall & Labuda, 2003; Girard et al., 2004). A recent publication revealed that a selected subset of salivary gland genes is expressed when infected ticks feed on na\u00efve mice (McNally et al., 2012).",

Ticks at the larvae, nymph, and adult life stages can become infected by feeding on infected animals (horizontal transmission) or can transmit virus vertically across instars (transstadial transmission) and through the eggs (transovarial transmission; Fig. 1a; Labuda et al., 1993a, 1996; Nuttall & Labuda, 2003). Indeed, results of a carefully controlled study in our laboratory show that transstadial transmission seems to be very high (Mitzel et al., 2007). The blood meal remains in the midgut for long periods of time, allowing infection of the epithelial cells lining the midgut with subsequent translocation into the hemocoel (Nuttall & Labuda, 2003). Infection of the midgut cells may be facilitated by the heterophagous nature of ticks (i.e. blood meal digestion is principally an intracellular process). In the open circulatory system, tissues and organs are bathed in hemolymph, which acts as a medium for transporting nutrients, hormones, and immune effector molecules. Therefore, the hemolymph likely serves as a viral dissemination medium. TBE virus was found in the esophagus and subesophageal ganglion in Dermacentor marginatus larvae and in columnar epidermal cells of Dermacentor reticulatus nymphs (Nuttall & Labuda, 2003). In D. reticulatus nymphs, TBE virus was demonstrated in epidermal cells and in vacuoles in the region of Golgi complexes of salivary gland cells (Nosek et al., 1984). The precise mechanisms by which TBFVs traverse various tissues in the tick and reach the salivary glands remain to be fully elucidated.",

            "text": "As is the case for TBFVs, the role of mosquitoes in the maintenance of the MBFV cycle is also well characterized. Mosquitoes are thought to account for transmitting approximately 50% of more than 70 known flaviviruses (Gould, 2001). Diverse mosquito species can be infected by MBFVs. However, the two major mosquito vectors are Aedes aegypti (e.g. transmission of YFV and DENV) and Culex species (e.g. transmission of WNV and JEV). Adult female mosquitoes become infected when they obtain blood meals from flavivirus infected animals, and virus replication in the mosquito has been well described (Girard et al., 2005; McGee et al., 2010; Colpitts et al., 2012). Girard et al. (2004) used immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that WNV infects epithelial cells of the Culex pipiens midgut and that viral antigen can be detected as early as day 2 postinfection. Viral antigen staining becomes more intense in the cells of the midgut over time until day 14 to 21 following infection (Girard et al., 2004). Using DENV 2, virus titer in the midgut peaks to about 9 \u00d7 103 pfu mL\u22121 by 10 days postinfection, but declines to about 7.4 \u00d7 102 pfu mL\u22121 by day 12 (S\u00e1nchez Vargas et al., 2009). Dissemination of virus into various tissues occurs at various time points, and the amount of antigen also varies. Similar to TBFVs in ticks, the hemolymph serves as a vehicle for viral dissemination. However, virus also spreads in a cell\u2013cell fashion to the muscle of the posterior midgut from 6 to 27 days postinfection (Girard et al., 2004). Studies with DENV 2 showed that infected mosquitoes mount an RNA interference (RNAi) mediated antiviral response, but impairing the vector RNAi resulted in increased viral replication (S\u00e1nchez Vargas et al., 2009). This mechanism could be associated with observations of flavivirus related RNA that persists as DNA in mosquitoes (Crochu et al., 2004). As mosquitoes are such efficient vectors for the transmission of the MBFVs, these reports suggest that the viruses have evolved a mechanism of evading the host response to persist in the vector.",

WNV can persist overwinter in mosquitoes that hibernate in cold months. Cool temperatures also facilitate persistence of flaviviruses in adult female mosquitoes. For example, St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) survived for more than 100 days of winter in Culex quinquefasciatus (Kramer & Ebel, 2003). Similarly, JEV and WNV have been transmitted by mosquitoes that carried the viruses at cold temperatures when exposed to temperature increases equal to ambient levels (Kramer & Ebel, 2003). However, at low temperature, mosquitoes are less likely to acquire new infections (Colpitts et al., 2012). At 18 \u00b0C, low WNV dissemination to the legs of the C. pipiens was observed, and rapid viral dissemination occurred at higher temperatures (Colpitts et al., 2012). Furthermore, higher temperatures increase vector population growth rate and the rate of viral evolution in the mosquito (Girard et al., 2005).",

Results of investigations carried out in the states of Oregon and Washington showed that the prevalence of WNV in both C. pipiens and Culex tarsalis was similar at 14.5% or 13.5%, respectively (Crowder et al., 2013). However, a study conducted in Stratford, Connecticut, showed that the C. pipiens was the most dominant mosquito captured in this WNV focus area (Anderson et al., 2004). In the captured mosquitoes, more than 85% of WNV isolations were from the same species, whereas Culex salinarius accounted for between 5% and 12% (Anderson et al., 2004). In a similar study conducted in Mexico, C. quinquefasciatus was more common at 48.3% and MBFV RNA was detected in 70% of the pools (Farfan Ale et al., 2009). It is evident that mosquitoes are important as viral hosts and vectors. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the MBFVs have evolved mechanisms of evading the host innate responses to persist in the MBFVs.",

In most instances, larger animals, such as cervids, goats, and sheep, are incidental hosts. The 1999 outbreak of WNV in humans in New York is thought to be associated with WNV infection in birds (Strausbaugh et al., 2001). The mosquito borne Wesselsbron virus could also be cycled between mosquitoes and birds, but not much is known about the vertebrate host(s). Thus, in nature, numerous species are susceptible to VBFVs and might serve as reservoirs or secondary amplifying hosts. In this section, we will survey the literature and the three potential markers for viral persistence: isolation of virus, identification of viral RNA or protein, and viral serology.",

In various wild rodent species captured in Brandenburg, Germany, an average TBEV infection rate of 15% was reported (Achazi et al., 2011). In the captured rodents, TBEV RNA was detected by RT PCR in the brains and spleens. In North America, deer mice (Peromyscus), squirrels, and the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) are important reservoirs of POWV and DTV (Main et al., 1979; Telford et al., 1997). Based on serological studies, a 6.2% DTV prevalence in the red backed voles (Myodes rutilus) was found in Siberia and Alaska (Deardorff et al., 2013). DTV in New Mexico was serologically prevalent in Peromyscus truei and Peromyscus maniculatus at 22.2% and 6.0%, respectively (Deardorff et al., 2013). Therefore, it seems likely that persistent infection of these small mammals occurs.",

Adult golden hamsters infected with WNV develop chronic infection, characterized by shedding of virus in urine for up to 8 months (Xiao et al., 2001; Ding et al., 2005; Tonry et al., 2005). The chronically infected animals exhibit antigens in tubular epithelial cells, interstitial cells, and macrophages of distal renal tubules (Tesh et al., 2005). Interestingly, na\u00efve hamsters inoculated intraperitoneally with WNV containing urine from persistently infected hamster do not develop clinical disease, but the hamsters become viremic and develop antibody responses (Ding et al., 2005).

However, in another study in which C57BL/6J mice were infected with WNV derived from the urine of persistently infected hamsters, the kidney was found to be the preferred organ for viral persistence (Saxena et al., 2013). The hamster derived WNV was also found to be highly attenuated in both neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence in infected mice (Saxena et al., 2013). These results also suggest that the virus acquires phenotypic changes to be able to persist.",

For example, the IFN induced tripartite motif protein, TRIM79\u03b1, has been shown to restrict TBEV replication by degrading NS5 (Taylor et al., 2011). The unimpeded deployment of these antiviral factors and systems would lead to cell death. Cell death is thought to be mediated primarily through apoptosis (R\u016f\u017eek et al., 2009), and programmed cell death induced by various TBFVs has been described in neurons, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and neuroblastoma cells (Ramanathan et al., 2006).",

During flavivirus infection, IFN production is induced within hours, but viral RNA replication complexes are enclosed in vesicles, which may offer protection from recognition by pathogen recognition receptors, thus delaying IFN production (Welsch et al., 2009; Gillespie et al., 2010; Overby et al., 2010; Offerdahl et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2013). In addition, some VBFVs can directly affect IFN secretion by inhibiting IFN gene transcription, suppressing IFN signaling or impairing the functions of interferon stimulated genes (Best et al., 2005; Robertson et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2013). The humoral and cell mediated immune responses are also prone to inhibition by VBFVs. Studies with WNV in C57BL/6 mice suggest that WNV specific antibodies correlate with decreased spread to the CNS (Diamond, 2003). Antibody escape mutants could also evade the T cell recognition (Diamond, 2003), but a precise role of these in viral persistence is yet to be defined.",

In addition, NS2A has also been implicated in causing IFN independent cytopathic effect (Chang et al., 1999; Melian et al., 2013). Observations in our laboratory (L. Mlera, D. Offerdahl & M.E. Bloom, unpublished results) and those of others (Lancaster et al., 1998) indicate that TBFV infection in mammalian cell culture is characterized by an acute phase, which kills most infected cells; however, a small number of cells survive the initial cytolytic phase, and the culture is repopulated with cells almost all of which are infected. Clearly, VBFV induces an acutely cytopathic infection in mammalian cells, and thus, the development of a persistent infection implies that cell death factors must be evaded or modulated, although the precise mechanisms are still obscure.",

For example, viral NS4A (Table 1) was shown to induce phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) dependent autophagy and thereby leading to protection from cell death (McLean et al., 2011). The manipulation of apoptosis by JEV, which activates PI3K in infected cells, was also reported (Lee et al., 2005). JEV triggers apoptosis during the late stages of infection, and the activation of PI3K is thought to provide protection from early cell death. Limited replication implies a low level of viral protein expression and may favor viral persistence.",

            "text": "Over the years, significant attention has been focused on defective interfering (DI) virus particles, which limit replication of the wild type virus (Schmaljohn & Blair, 1977; Debnath et al., 1991; Blitvich et al., 1999). The DI particles represent truncated genomes that can be replicated and encapsidated and compete with wild type viral particles when they infect cells. In vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), DI particles are thought to modulate virulence (Cave et al., 1985). However, the role of VBFV DI particles in persistence is not completely certain. For TBEV, the C protein is reported to tolerate internal deletions ranging from 4 to 21 amino acids, and the deletions seem to favor attenuation and immunogenicity (Kofler et al., 2002). DI particles of VBFVs, such as Murray valley encephalitis (MVE), TBEV Sofjin strain, and WNV, are known to generate truncated NS1 proteins, following infection at high multiplicity of infection (Debnath et al., 1991; Poidinger et al., 1991; Chen et al., 1996; Bugrysheva et al., 2001). Persistent infection of Vero cells with MVE was associated with a truncated NS1, whereas this form of NS1 was not noted in the acute infection (Brinton, 1982; Lancaster et al., 1998). The truncated NS1 in MVE virus was a result of the presence of DI RNA, which contained a large internal deletion (Lancaster et al., 1998). In this case, MVE DI particles reduced the wild type MVE titer by 75\u201395% (Poidinger et al., 1991). However, a causal role for the MVE DI particles in maintaining persistent infection was not conclusively demonstrated. Studies of the Far Eastern Sofjin strain of the TBEV complex identified a 39 kDa truncated NS1 in both acutely and persistently infected human kidney RH cells (Bugrysheva et al., 2001). For WNV, naturally occurring DI particles interfere with transmission in mosquitoes and minimally impact pathogenesis in mice (Pesko et al., 2012). Furthermore, truncated DENV RNA species, suggesting the presence of DI particles, have been identified in acute human infections (Li et al., 2011), but have not been described in other acute VBFV infections in humans. Similarly, Banzi virus DI particles seem to have been generated in resistant C3H/RV mice (Smith, 1981). Although DI particles and the truncated NS1 may be frequently observed in persistent infections, it is not at all clear that they are independently sufficient for the establishment and maintenance of a persistent infection in vitro or in vivo. Stable expression of truncated NS1 failed to render persistent infection with JEV, suggesting that truncated NS1 is a consequence rather than a cause for viral persistence (Liao et al., 1998). The role of DI particles merits further investigation, but the role of other aspects of virus biology should also be scrutinized.",

Similarly, WNV delays recognition by pathogen recognition receptors by activating IRF3 in a RIG I dependent manner without antagonizing the host IFN response (Fredericksen & Gale, 2006). The mechanism of evasion is currently not clear, but membrane bound vesicles that enclose the RIG I activating dsRNA of TBEV have been described (Overby et al., 2010). As the delayed recognition of viral pathogen associated molecular patterns is only temporary, these manipulations are probably just among the suite of mechanisms deployed for the establishment of viral persistence. The specific viral genes and how they manipulate apoptosis at a cellular level needs further examination.",

For instance, the overexpression of the proto oncogene Bcl 2 was reported to prevent apoptosis and promote persistence in JEV infected BHK and CHO cells (Liao et al., 1998), suggesting that the control of apoptosis is likely to be implicated. In addition, some inbred laboratory mice strains can carry the 2\u2032 5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase gene, Flvr, which confers flavivirus resistance (Urosevic et al., 1997). The animals are productively infected with flaviviruses, but produce low virus titer (Brinton & Perelygin, 2003; Barkhash et al., 2010). Mice that are susceptible to flavivirus infection carry the Flvs allele. The Flvr like allele has also been characterized in wild mice and could be a partial explanation of flavivirus persistence in rodents in nature (Urosevic et al., 1997). Additional vertebrate genes, apart from the Flv, could play a role in varied susceptibilities of different mouse strains to flavivirus infection. This was suggested from recent observations that TBEV infected BALBc mice were moderately resistant, STS mice are highly resistant, whereas the BALBc/STS recombinant mice were highly sensitive to infection (Palus et al., 2013).",

The follicular B cell lymphoma, from which he had suffered, may have facilitated, or aggravated, the persistence of WNV. In mice, transient immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide leads to WNV recrudescence (Appler et al., 2010), an observation suggesting that some aspects of the immune system operate to restrict WNV replication during persistence. However, the situation is complicated because WNV is able to persist for up to 16 months in the face of a robust humoral immune response in C57BL/6 mice (Appler et al., 2010). Furthermore, WNV persistence was reported in the brains of CD8+ T cell deficient rodents (Shrestha & Diamond, 2004), but the CD8+ T cell deficiency did not affect the antibody response in this mouse model. Knowledge about specific immune system components that could facilitate or control viral persistence remains to be characterized.",

Hantaviruses are segmented, RNA viruses that cause lifelong infections in their reservoir rodent hosts, despite high levels of neutralizing antibodies (Botten et al., 2000; Meyer & Schmaljohn, 2000; Easterbrook & Klein, 2008). Pathogen recognition receptors, such as RIG I and TLR7, are not elevated in the lungs of infected rats, suggesting that evasion of viral recognition may contribute toward the establishment of a persistent infection. Perhaps, the reason for noninduction of RIG I is the fact that hantaviruses do not produce detectable amounts of dsRNA (Wang et al., 2011). IFNs, such as IFN \u03b2, IFN \u03bb, MxA, and pro inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and transcription factor genes are elevated midway in the infection followed by a down regulation that favors the expression of TGF \u03b2 (Schountz et al., 2012). A continued up regulation of the cytokines could be detrimental to the cell, and the virus would fail to persist. Results of a recently established animal model also show that host adapted SNV achieves prolonged and disseminated infection, with no disease in hamsters (Safronetz et al., 2013). Therefore, hantaviruses may have evolved mechanisms of manipulating target genes, which establishes persistence when induced.",

In LCMV clone 13 (Cl13), a glutamine at position 1079 in the glycoprotein (lysine in the ARM 53b strain of LCMV) is important for persistence, but its precise function is unknown (Salvato et al., 1991; Moskophidis et al., 1995). The mechanisms of LCMV persistence are linked to the down regulation of MHC and costimulatory molecules, inflammatory cytokines, as well as virus induced production of immunosuppressive cytokines (Ng et al., 2011). The inability of CD134 deficient mice to control LCMV infection over time was reported to be a result of CD4 and CD8 responses (Boettler et al., 2012). In addition, OX40 also has a role in the establishment of persistent LMCV infection (Boettler et al., 2012). A recent report showed that IFN blockade of type I IFN signaling results in a CD4 T cell dependent clearance of LCMV Cl13 (Teijaro et al., 2013). This is an interesting observation considering that IFN induction is part of the antiviral response and that its induction can lead to apoptosis. However, the precise mechanism of persistence is not completely clear (Easterbrook & Klein, 2008), but it also demonstrates \u2018clever\u2019 viral manipulation of the host system to establish persistence.",

Coxsackievirus B3 has been implicated toward the development of certain chronic muscle diseases, such as chronic inflammatory myopathy (Lodge et al., 1987; Tam & Messner, 1999). Coxsackievirus persistence in cell culture can take two forms: (1) an incurable steady state characterized by nonlytic virus infection and (2) an antiviral curable carrier culture system (Brinton, 2013; Pierson & Kielian, 2013). While mechanisms of coxsackievirus persistence are not completely understood, down regulation of the coxsackievirus receptor (CAR) has been suggested to play a role in viral persistence (Varatharaj, 2010). Down regulation of CAR in coxsackievirus infected HL 1 cells occurs rapidly from 60% following three passages to 90% at passage 8 (Varatharaj, 2010). The importance of CAR down regulation is emphasized by the fact that in vitro CAR knockout results in reduced viral replication as well as virus induced cell lysis (Tomori, 2004; Gulati & Maheshwari, 2007).",

Furthermore, mutations in NS2A of Kunjin virus result in increased IFN levels, suggesting an IFN antagonistic role of NS2A (Liu et al., 2004). Intriguing is the fact that VBFVs antagonize IFN even in the cells that will eventually die in the acute phase of infection.

By an as yet uncharacterized mechanism, progeny genomes are delivered to adjacent ER membranes where the capsid protein mediates assembly and inclusion of prM E into immature virions (h). The immature virions transit the Golgi membrane system (i), and as a mild pH change occurs, the cellular enzyme furin cleaves the prM E linkage (j), allowing the virus particle to assume its final mature stage prior to release from the cell (k).
