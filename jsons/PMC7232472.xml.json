In experimental settings, mice and non-human primates (NHPs) challenged with 3\u201310 x LD50 of RT by aerosol succumb to intoxication within a 24\u201348 h period [2,3]. The underlying cause of death following pulmonary RT exposure is likely acute respiratory distress [3,4,5,6]. Alveolar macrophages (AM) are particularly susceptible to RT and are postulated to contribute to amplification of disease severity through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which have the potential to sensitize airway epithelial cells to toxin-induced programmed cell death [7,8,9,10,11].",

Towards this goal, we recently demonstrated that a single infusion (25 mg/kg) of an extended serum-half-life variant of huPB10 called PB10-LS was sufficient to protect Rhesus macaques, 28 days later, from an RT challenge by aerosol [13]. PB10, originally identified as a mouse MAb, is directed against an immunodominant epitope near RTA\u2019s active site [14] and is proposed to neutralize RT by interfering with trafficking of the toxin from the plasma membrane to the trans Golgi network (TGN) [15]. Humanized PB10 and the PB10-LS were each expressed in a Nicotiana benthamiana-based manufacturing platform [16,17].",

In that study, mice treated with low-dose PB10 alone survived intranasal ricin challenge, but experienced weight loss, moderate pulmonary inflammation (e.g., elevated IL-1 and IL-6 levels, PMN influx), and apoptosis of lung macrophages.

First, locally delivered antibodies have the potential to intercept RT before it can access the respiratory mucosa, possibly dampening early pro-inflammatory responses that contribute to ARDS [5]. Poli and colleagues demonstrated more than 20 years ago that aerosolized delivery of polyclonal anti-ricin antibodies one hour before a subsequent aerosolized ricin challenge was able to protect mice from toxin-induced death [18]. In that study, antibody was delivered by small particle aerosol with a Collison nebulizer. Secondly, we are interested in the prospect of developing a self-administered (inhalable) immunoprophylactic capable of conferring immediate immunity to category B toxins like RT. Indeed, Respaud and colleagues have already described a drug delivery system for efficient alveolar delivery of a neutralizing MAb to treat pulmonary intoxication [19].",

Specifically, in a parallel study, BAL fluids (and sera) were collected from mice at fixed intervals (+4, +24, +48, +72 h) after MAb administration and evaluated by RT-specific ELISA. The results revealed an estimated antibody half-life in the BAL fluids of ~18 h (Figure 3A). In serum, low levels (0.1\u20130.3 \u00b5g/mL) of PB10/SylH3 MAb were detected at the +24 h timepoint and persisted until at least 72 h (Figure 3B). Taken together, the results suggest a local threshold concentration of >1 \u03bcg/mL of PB10/SylH3 is required to fully protect mice against the effects of pulmonary RT exposure.",

The chimeric mouse Fv-human IgG1 Fc variant of SylH3 constructed several years ago was used as the starting material [22]. Candidate humanized SylH3 MAbs were first generated computationally using the Molecular Operating Environment software, which surveyed the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for the best fit human structures. Humanized variants were then further evaluated in silico for a variety of features that impact assembly and expression (e.g., methionine oxidation, asparagine deamidation, glycosylation, etc.). Based on these computational criteria, we generated expression vectors for nine candidate light chains and nine candidate heavy chains and expressed 81 unique antibody combinations in the RAMP system. The combinations demonstrating sufficient expression levels necessary for future scale-up were then tested in vitro. A total of eight Fv-humanized SylH3 candidates met the express level threshold and were evaluated for binding affinity by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Figure S1) and in vitro toxin-neutralizing activity in Vero cell cytotoxicity assay (Table 1). Based on binding affinity, toxin-neutralizing activity, and pilot production yields, a single variant, huSylH3 07/03, was chosen as the lead molecule.",

As a control, groups of mice received huSylH3 (2 mg/kg), huPB10 (2 mg/kg) or the combination of huSylH3 and huPB10 (2 mg/kg) concurrently with RT (t = 0). The results revealed that the humanized MAb cocktail performed as well as the mouse MAb cocktail. The RT only group lost a significant amount of weight by day 2 post-challenge and expired by day 3. The groups of mice that received the huSylH3/huPB10 cocktail at \u221224 h, \u22124 h, or time 0 survived the RT challenge and did not experience any significant weight loss in the subsequent two weeks.

Following inhalation, RT triggers hemorrhage, inflammatory exudate, and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), which coincide with an influx of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and overall disease severity [3,5,8,11,12]. The underlying pathophysiology of RT is the consequence of ricin\u2019s two subunits, RTA and RTB, working in concert to promote programed cell death in different cell types. RTB promotes toxin uptake into mammalian cells by at least two distinct pathways [23], while RTA inactivates ribosomes with near perfect efficiency [24]. Alveolar macrophages are particularly sensitive to RT and their numbers plummet within hours of toxin exposure [7,10,25]. Mucosal damage is exacerbated by TNF-\u03b1 and its family members like TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which render lung epithelial cells hyper-sensitive to the effects of RT [9,26].",

Mice that received PB10/SylH3 cocktail concurrently with RT did not experience weight loss or have any significant lung inflammation, as measured by histopathology and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1, IL-6). The PB10/SylH3 mixture was also highly effective at shielding alveolar macrophages from ricin-induced killing, which we postulate is due to the fact that MAbs are present locally within the lung environment.

Ultimately, we are interested in the prospect of developing a self-administered (inhalable) immunoprophylactic capable of conferring immediate immunity to RT, which could be used in the field by military or civilian first responders. As noted in the introduction, Respaud and colleagues have already conducted proof-of-principle studies and successfully delivered an RT-specific neutralizing MAb to mice with the goal of preventing/treating pulmonary intoxication [19]. There are obvious technical challenges associated with this route of delivery, including distinct differences in IgG half-lives within the context of the lung, which have been noted even when the MAbs that have the same Fc domains [27,28,29,30]. The apparent differences in half lives were attributed to non-specific tissue binding or poor stability dictated in part by the Fv elements. Nonetheless, the fundamental biology and technology associated with aerosol delivery of MAbs could be applied in theory to combatting other toxins or infectious agents that cause severe acute respiratory disease, including the new coronavirus (SARS CoV-2).",

SylH3\u2032s in vitro profile is similar to many other anti-RTB MAbs that have been described in the literature, although it stands out because it is the most effective MAb in our collection at blocking RT-receptor interactions in vitro [31]. We hypothesize that the PB10/SylH3 cocktail has dual activities: it blocks RT attachment to host cells and it interferes with retrograde transport of ricin from the plasma membrane to the TGN [31,32]. We hypothesize that the presence of huPB10 and huSyH3 in the lung at the time of ricin challenge results in antibody-mediated entrapment of the toxin within the alveolar space. This hypothesis is based on a recent study in mice with the anti-Ebola antibody cocktail ZMapp, which indicated that the antibodies did indeed limit accessibility and mobility of the virus in the airways [33].",

It is unclear whether the PB10/SylH3 cocktail is any more potent that other possible combinations of MAbs described, since systematic comparisons have not been conducted, although certainly the two MAbs are the best within our collection [10].

Specifically, we have observed that RT-PB10/SylH3 immune complexes given to mice by the intranasal route elicit long-lasting toxin-neutralizing antibody responses that persists for months (Tolman, L.; Yates, J.; Rong, Y. and Mantis, N. manuscript in preparation). The phenomenon is reminiscent of a so-called \u201cvaccinal effect\u201d in which immune complexes prime both cellular and humoral immunity following a Fc-receptor-dependent antigen sampling by dendritic cells [43]. Thus, the PB10/SylH3 cocktail may have a dual benefit, in conferring passive immunity as well as eliciting active long-lasting anti-toxin immunity.",

(Panels A,B) Groups of BALB/c mice (n = 5 mice/group) were administered RT in vehicle RT plus huPB10 (green triangle) or RT plus huSylH3 at time 0. (Panels C,D) Groups of mice (n = 5 mice/group) received huPB10/huSylH3 cocktail at the indicated time points prior to RT challenge. MAbs and the MAb cocktails were given at a final dose of 2 mg/kg by the intranasal route. Mice were challenged with 10 x LD50 RT and then monitored for 14 days. (Panels A,C) Kaplan-Meier survival plots. (Panel B,D) Weight per day per group (average with SEM). Statistical analysis of weight loss was performed using Friedman tests with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison tests. In panel B, mice that received RT plus huPB10 displayed ruffled fur, hunching, ataxia, weakness, and/or reduced movement (clinical score, 2). Mice that received RT plus huSylH3 displayed severe weakness, tremors, head tilt, seizures (clinical score, 3) and were euthanized. In panel D, the group of animals that received the cocktail at \u221248 h (pink circles) experienced significant weight loss on days 4, 6, and 7 post-challenge (as indicated by asterisk and horizontal bar) and a single mouse succumbed to intoxication. The mouse that succumbed to challenge on day 4 was excluded from that point forward from the weight loss analysis. During the course of the study, mice were weighed daily and visually inspected twice daily.",
