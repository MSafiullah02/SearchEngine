            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was the 4 th cancer killer in 1990, however in 2000 it ranked 3 rd in the world (Parkin et al. 2001). In China, HCC ranked 2 nd of cancer mortality since 1990s. Despite encouraging data of HCC treatment have been reported in some research centers, the dismal outcome of HCC remains unchanged according to the population-based data. Challenge and prospect in the early 21 st century will be briefly delineated. (1) Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV), aflatoxin intake and alcohol remain the major causative factors of HCC. Primary prevention using HB vaccine has shown a decrease of HCC incidence in vaccinated children (Lee et al. 2003). The analysis of literature revealed that interferon (IFN) reduced incidence of both HBV and HCV-related HCC, but more studies are needed (Tabor et al. 2003). (2) The recent advances of HCC treatment indicated that surgery will remain to play a major role in the treatment of HCC. In the 1970s to 1980s, small HCC resection has contributed to the increase of long-term survival after HCC resection. At the author's institution, the analysis of 5364 inpatients demonstrated that the marked increase of 5-year survival (from 4.2%, 22.6% to 42.3% in the three consecutive periods) was well correlated to the marked increase of small HCC resection in the series (from 1%, 19.2% to 38.8%); moreover, of the 680 patients survived more than 5 years, 56% of patients received small HCC resection. Screening using alpha fetoprotein assay in HBsAg carriers was reported to detect resectable HCC with increased survival (McMahon et al. 2000). However, small HCC resection is facing the challenge of regional cancer therapy (such as radiofrequency ablation), and particularly the biological characteristics of HCC, which remain the major obstacle for further improve prognosis of small HCC resection. Down-staging and followed by resection will probably be a new approach for treatment of a part of unresectable HCC in the new century. (3) The role of liver transplantation in the treatment of HCC will gradually increase, but it is mainly indicated for small HCC without vascular invasion and with Child B or Child C cirrhosis that not suitable for resection. The expenses, shortage of donor organ and relapsed of viral hepatitis (particularly HCV) are problems remain to be solved. Living donor is one of the solutions. (4) The technique and concept of minimally invasive surgery will be a major influencing factor for treatment of HCC in the early 21 st century. As a result of earlier diagnosis, different modes of regional cancer therapy for HCC will further develop. Three dimensional conformal radiotherapy, a kind of regional cancer therapy, will play a more important role. (5) Systemic chemotherapy has been disappointing in the past but the future can be promising, such as selective chemotherapy. Biotherapy, including cytokines, differentiation inducers, anti-angiogenic agents, gene therapy and tumor vaccine will probably play a role, particularly in the prevention of tumor metastasis and recurrence. Unfortunately, based on the analysis of more than 60 randomized controlled trials, nothing have been thoroughly proved to prolong survival of patients with unresectable HCC, except transcatheter arterial chemoemobolization, which needs further study. (6) HCC invasion and metastasis will be a major target to be studied in the new century. To this end, a stepwise metastatic human HCC model system has been established at the author's institution, which will be of value for searching HCC metastasis related chromosomes / genes / proteins. Monogene-based studies revealed that HCC was similar to that of other solid tumors, and biological characteristics of small HCC was only slightly better than that of large HCC. Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genotyping, cDNA microarray and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we got some interesting results. In particular, collaborated with NCI, NIH in the United States, we generated a molecular signature that can classify metastatic HCC patients, identified osteopontin as a lead gene in the signature, and found that genes favoring metastasis progression were initiated in the primary tumors. We also found that chromosome 8p deletion, particularly in the region of 8p23, associated with HCC metastasis. Cytokeratin 19 was identified as the only protein that appears in MHCC97H but not in MHCC97L. Experimental interventions using the high metastatic nude mice model have provided clues for prevention of HCC metastasis. Translation from bench to bedside demonstrated that serum VEGF, microvessel density and p53 scoring may be of value for prediction of postoperative metastatic recurrence. Interferon alpha proved effective for prevention of recurrence both experimentally and clinically. In short, HCC metastasis that probably initiated in the primary tumor is a multigene involved, multistep and changing process, the further elucidation of the mechanism underlying HCC metastasis will provide more solid basis for the prediction and prevention of metastatic recurrence of HCC. To sum up, many stones yet unturned for the conquering of HCC in the 21 st century, but the future will be hopeful.",

In addition, those born after the program but were not protected from HCC were analyzed for the possible causes. The incidence of HCC in 6~14-year-olds declined from 0.51 per 100,000 in those born before 1984 to 0.15 per 100,000 in those born after 1984 (p<0.001).

New findings relating to the pathophysiology of encephalopathy, the most important clinical manifestation of ALF, will be presented, namely the importance of infection and the Systemic Inflammatory Reponse Syndrome (SIRS). Correlated with the development of the more severe grades of encephalopathy and of cerebral oedema, infection -together with SIRS -modulates the effects of hyperamonaemia and other toxins on the brain in ALF. Such synergistic action leads to oxidative stress with the characteristic changes in astrocyte size and function, as well as the generation of nitric oxide in the brain, which may explain the important vaso-motor changes, particularly the increase in cerebral bloodflow. The latter may be controlled by the use of hypothermia and other new understanding of the pathophysiology of multi-organ failure in ALF have led to improved management regimes, particularly for the frequently associated Hepatorenal Syndrome. Temporary liver support, based on albumin dialysis in the MARS system, is being increasingly used to enhance spontaneous recovery and as a bridge to liver transplantation, though not yet proven by a controlled clinical trial. In the face of falling cadaver donor availability, techniques based on living related organ donation and partial liver transplantation using split liver cadaver organs, are increasingly important. Reference will also be made to a changing pattern of aetiology and epidemiology in ALF with a marked contrast between the West and Far Eastern parts of the world, with in the latter region the major problem of acute reactivation of chronic HBV carriers.",

            "text": "In recent years several L-nucleoside analogs were discovered to have potent activity against HBV/HIV, among which Lamivudine, L-Fsddc and LFd4c are active against both HBV and HIV, whereas L-FMAU and L-ddT are active against HBV but not active against HIV. All of the above mentioned L-nucleosides are either approved for clinical usage or are at different stages of clinical development. All of the compounds exert their antiviral action through the preferential interaction of their active triphosphate metabolites with viral DNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase. The potency of those compounds against HBV is different with L-Fd4L being the most potent one among them. The mutatans of HBV DNA polymerase, M550V/I in accompany with V526M or other, could vendor virus being resistant to all those L-nucleoside described above although the degree of resistance of mutated virus to those compounds could be different. 2-Fd4C could be active against M550V/V526M mutant at non-cytotoxic concentration although to less degree against parallel virus. Those compounds are active against HBV of HBV e_ patent. The formation of their active triphosphate metabolites requires stepwise phosphorylation by host cellular enzymes from nucleoside to nucleoside monophosphate, then to nucleoside diphosphate and finally to nucleoside triphosphate. The host enzymes involved and their interaction with nucleoside or metabolite are not at all the same. The behaviors of metabolism of L-nucleosides in cells differ from one to another. The variation of the host enzymes involved in targeted cells among different individuals could play a determinant role in the anti-viral action and toxicity of these L-nucleosides. Some of these L-nucleoside triphosphates could also be incorporated into host cellular DNA by host DNA polymerase and exert their activity as DNA chain terminators. This prevents host cell DNA replication or DNA repair. Apurine DNA endonuclease (APE-1) was found to excise these L-nucleosides efficiently from the terminals of DNA in nuclei. The activity of this enzyme could play an important role in determining the toxicity of these L-nucleosides. In summary, the variations in the activity of the involved cellular enzymes among different individuals or tissues are important not only for the antiviral action but also for the toxicity of L-nucleosides. Each of those Lnucleoside has its unique characteristics.",

            "text": "In Asia, liver transplantation started in 1977 in China. The majority of the recipients suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma and the results were unsatisfactory. In recent years, with the improvement of surgical techniques and selection of non-cancerous patients for transplantation, liver transplant activities increase rapidly with satisfactory results. In other parts of Asia, because of the lack of cadaveric liver grafts, live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) was adopted in 1990 and rapidly became the mainstream of liver transplantation. Initially, the operation was confined to children. In 1993, Makuuchi et al performed the first successful adult-to-adult LDLT using the left lobe graft. Although left lobe LDLT is gaining popularity in Japan, it cannot be employed extensively because the donor must be larger in size than the recipient in order that his/her left lobe is of sufficient volume for the recipient. To overcome the problem of size mismatch, we initiated right lobe LDLT in 1996. Such an operation finds wider application because even a donor smaller in body size than the recipient can donate a right lobe of sufficient size to the recipient. By now, right lobe LDLT is adopted in many liver transplant centres in Asia. However, up to now, there is no consensus about the minimum graft size for successful implantation and the need for inclusion of middle hepatic vein in the graft. We favor the inclusion of middle hepatic vein in the graft as it could ensure uniform venous drainage and maximum graft function. Right lobe LDLT effectively reduces the potential recipient mortality rate while waiting for cadaveric liver graft both in situations of acute liver failure and chronic liver failure. According to our experience, the long-term outcome of right lobe graft recipient is equivalent to that of cadaveric full size graft transplantation. Safety of the donor is well documented in the recent survey of 5 major transplant centres in Asia. The overall morbidity rate was 15.8%, with most complications being minor wound infections. Until now, there is only one donor mortality in Asia. Right lobe LDLT will become a standard operation in the future. However, because of the potential donor risk, cadaveric organ donation remains necessary and should be an important priority in Asia.",

The most reliable assays, with the widest dynamic ranges are essential in that the decision to continue or discontinue therapy is greatly impacted by this information. Data from two large PEG IFN clinical trials was used to determine the earliest time following the initiation of therapy that therapy could be stopped with a high negative predictive probability. The analysis determined that those who did not become HCV RNA undetectable or who did not reach a decrease of 2-logs in viral level or greater following 12 weeks of therapy did not respond to continued therapy. Utilizing this decision point and criteria three months of cost and side effects can be spared by stopping therapy at the end of three months. Conversely, the accurate twelve week determination of EVR can be a useful motivating factor for patient compliance to therapy. It has been reported that patients who are at least 80% adherent throughout the duration of therapy can realize better SVR rates.",

Individuals such as thalassemic patients requiring frequent blood product transfusion have particular high anti-HCV positive rate. Chronicity occurs in 80%.

More accurate data now is available with the more sensitive and specific second and third generation assays for anti-HCV. The epidemiologic variation is great, e.g. less than 0.2 % of blood donors in Hong Kong is anti-HCV positive compared to over 50% in some parts of China where paid donors still exist. CHC is mostly an asymptomatic progressive disease, resulting in cirrhosis (\u00bb10-20% in 10 years) and hepatocellular carcinoma (1-4% per year among the patients with cirrhosis). Co-infection with HBV is not uncommon in HBV endemic Asian countries and accelerates disease progression. Genotype 1b predominates, as in other global regions, and genotype 6 is found exclusively among Southeast Asians. Therapy with interferon, interferon and ribavirin combination, and more recently pegylated interferon with or without combination with ribavirin has improved response and long term prognosis. Studies on natural history of CHC simulated by the Markov model help the assessment in long term outcome, the decision in management, and the analysis of cost-effectiveness of different modalities of therapy.",

Both peginterferon alfa 2a and alfa 2b result in increased sustained virological response (SVRs) when administered as monotherapy versus standard interferon, and further improvements in SVR have been obtained when peginterferons have been combined with ribavirin. In combination, peginterferon plus ribavirin has increased overall SVR by 7 per cent for peginterferon alfa 2b and by 9 per cent for peginterferon alfa 2a compared to that with standard interferon. For both pegylated products, response was improved in patients with genotype 1 infection. There has been some controversy about the appropriate dose of ribavirin. Data have emerged from a trial of peginterferon alfa 2a, in which response to treatment of genotype 1 infection was greater with 1,000/1,200 mg of ribavirin (based on a body weight of 75kg) than with 800 mg. Moreover, SVR was greater in patients with this genotype when treatment was administered for 48 rather than 24 weeks. In contrast 400 mg bid of ribavirin for 24 weeks was sufficient for patients with genotype non-1 infection.",

Cumulative recurrence curves for patients showed that the patients in group A recurred significantly fewer than did those in group B (p0.05).

The presently available HBV carriers, HBsAg positive and negative, are vast in number and highly risky to develop HCC and/or severe cirrhosis. The clear definition of the absolute importance of the major causative agents in hepatocarcinogenesis and the development of approaches to control their exposure should be important. Recent studies had shown that in a consecutive series of 181 pathologically proven HCC patients in Qidong, all of them (181/181) had one or more HBV infection markers, such as HBsAg and anti-HBc or anti-HBc and HBV X gene unique sequences. The prevalence of serum HBsAg in local general population was 16% on a large scale survey with RIA. In contrast, 5.0% (6/119) of the HCC cases and 1.1% (3/287) of the sampled population were positive in serum anti-HCV. Pathological examinations showed that 100% (181/181) of the HCC cases were diagnosed of having chronic hepatitis, mostly chronic active. Therefore, presence of chronic hepatitis B (HB) was shown to be virtually ubiquitous in Qidong HCC patients, indicating its necessary role in hepatocarcinogenesis of Qidong. Similar findings in HBV infection status were also observed in HCC series in North China, but 11.8% (14/119) were co-infected with HCV. Prospective study showed that missense mutation of 249 codon of p53 gene in HCC was tightly associated with pre-exposure to aflatoxin on the background of HBV infection. Aflatoxin exposure 3.5 fold increased the risk of HCC whereas HBV infection greatly increased the sensitivity of the hepatocytes to aflatoxin. A cumulative dosage of 0.35 ug/kg body weight was shown to be able to cause HCC in HBV infected men among whom the specific molecular footprint of 249arg/ser mutation of p53 was left in the HCC DNA of all seven HCC cases followed and operated. This dosage was 700 fold lower than the carcinogenic dosage of aflatoxin to induce HCC in rhesus monkeys reported. 97 of the 181 HCC cases (54%) were shown to bear the p53 hotspot mutation, but no single case was free from HBV infection, indicating the co-factor role of aflatoxin in its range of exposure commonly detected in Qidong. The age specific 249arg/ser mutation rate of HCC in Qidong, when analyzed with the relevant HCC incidence data, could explain why Qidong HBV carriers were 3.5 times more risky in developing HCC than their Beijing counterpart. 50% or more of the increased HCC portion in Qidong HBsAg positive population came from the clonal growth of 249arg/ser mutants as a result of the interaction of HBV infection and aflatoxin exposure. The above facts strongly indicated that effective treatment of HBV infection using the rapidly developing chemo-immunotherapy as well as the advised reduction of aflatoxin intake under monitoring in high risk people might constitute the effective approaches to significantly reduce the risk of HCC in the large number of chronic HB patients, especially in areas of prevalence.",

As in the case of HBV-related HCC, viral replication level, as indicated by HBeAg, has been shown correlated with risk of HCC. Recent clinical studies also suggested the genotypes of HBV may influence the risk to develop HCC. To address the roles of HBV viral loads and genotypes in HCC, we conducted a case-control study with large number of male HBsAg carriers. The results indicated both increased viral loads (higher than 10,000 copies/ml) and genotype C are two independent risk factors for HCC.",

Attempts have been made to inhibit HBV and coronavirus replication by specific siRNAs. We have succeeded in demonstrating an almost complete inhibition of HBV replication by stablyexpressed 21-mer short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which degraded HBV pregenomic RNA and mRNAs. Besides the conventional targets on HBV reverse-transcriptase, we also targeted other sites of pregenomic RNA, including DR elements, S, and X gene. The anti-HBV efficacy of siRNA is much more potent than that of lamivudine. Our results indicated that shRNAs can serve as efficient alternative anti-HBV agents.

This represented a 90% decrease from 1985, primarily as a result of the requirements for vaccination by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

In hospital settings, the most common route of infection is following a needle stick or other sharp-instrument injury. The risk of acquiring clinical hepatitis B from blood that is HBeAg positive following a hollow needle injury is about 30% (range 22-31%). HBV concentrations in these patients often exceed 10 9 genomes/mL. Transmission rates are almost 10-fold lower (about 3% with a range from 1-6%) when the blood is HBsAg and anti-HBe positive. However, this lower risk is dependent on whether the blood contains an HBV precore mutation. Such individuals have significantly higher levels of replicating HBV and are positive for HBV DNA at levels usually exceeding 500,000 genomes/mL. Other bodily secretions and excretions (e.g., saliva) may be positive for HBsAg but contain infectious HBV that is 100 to 10,000 times less than that found in the blood. The successful experimental transmission of hepatitis B to children by the oral route using human serum containing high-titered virus, although with apparently minor clinical consequences, has been cited as supporting the possibility that oral transmission may occur under natural conditions through contaminated saliva or nasopharyngeal fluid. The subsequent detection of HBV in saliva intensified interest in saliva as a mechanism for transmitting HBV. It is postulated that saliva is contaminated by virus entering the mouth through the crevicular fluid at the gingival surface following rinsing of the mouth with water or after mastication. Alternatively, peripheral blood lymphocytes contaminating saliva may be another source of HBV DNA. In three separate animal studies, five anthropoid apes were found to be susceptible to HBsAg-positive saliva, but only by parenteral routes (subcutaneous and intravenous). No hepatitis B occurred in 13 primates that received HBV-contaminated saliva by the oral route. It is concluded that unless the inoculum is large or the concentration of virus is high, oral transmission by saliva or by objects contaminated with saliva is probably rare in nature, although percutaneous transmission via a human bite has been reported.",

For preexposure immunoprophylaxis, hepatitis B vaccine is given at 0,1 and 6 months by intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle to achieve optimal protection. Longer intervals between the last dose results in higher final titers of anti-HBs. If the vaccination schedule is interrupted after the first dose, the second dose should be given as soon as possible, with the second and third dose separated by an interval of at least 2 months. If the third dose is delayed, administration can proceed whenever convenient. To ensure that protective levels of antibody have been generated, blood from at-risk HCP should be examined by a quantitative anti-HBs assay after the basic immunization series has been completed. A report from the laboratory that the anti-HBs test is \"positive\" or \"reactive\" is not satisfactory because the level of protection may be inadequate. Based on quantitative anti-HBs results, vaccination status can be divided into four groups: (a) nonresponders, no detectable anti-HBs; (b) inadequate responder or hyporesponder, positive for anti-HBs, but with a concentration of less than 10 mIU/mL; (c) low responder, with a concentration of 10 to 100 mIU/mL; and (d) normal or adequate responder, with a concentration of greater than 100 mIU/mL. A fifth category, high responder, can be used for anti-HBs responses of greater than 1000 mIU/mL. These designations have some clinical relevance in that nonresponders or inadequate responders continue to be at risk of acquiring HBV, whereas risk of infection is low to absent in the other categories. Nonresponders or inadequate responders should be examined for evidence of HBV infection as a reason for their inability to generate an adequate anti-HBs response. In the absence of this discovery, booster doses \u00da consisting of one to three additional injections of vaccine using the standard dose or four times the standard dose (e.g., the dialysis formulation) \u00da are recommended. Persons who do not respond to an initial 3-dose vaccine series have a 30-50% chance of responding to a second 3-dose series. In general, the anti-HBs concentrations remain low in these individuals. Most experts will agree that low responders also should be encouraged to receive a booster inoculation 2-5 years after their last injection because breakthrough disease seems to occur earlier and more frequently in this group. In one study in homosexual men, 26% of 139 non-or hyporesponders had serologic and/or clinical evidence of HBV infection, with 44% of these subjects displaying HBsAg in the sampled specimen. Six of these subjects (4.3% of the total group) became persistently infected.",

It has been demonstrated that 61% of the gloves worn by scrub nurses had one or more punctures compared with 24-37% of surgeons' gloves. The highest risk of glove perforations occurred among general surgeons compared to other specialties. Most of the perforations are self-inflicted and occur during closure of the wound. Major operations involving the use of a mass closure technique carry a high risk of glove puncture. Most tears are on the digits or distal interphalangeal crease of the nondominant hand. Most punctures go unrecognized. Double gloving confers some protection. In one study, the puncture rate of the inner gloves was only 2% indicating that double gloving may maintain a barrier between the patient and the surgeon in four out of five cases. A decrease in tactile sensitivity and manual dexterity are the presumed reasons that this practice is not more common.

The site of the wound that was in contact with blood or body fluids should be washed immediately with soap and water. Mucous membranes should be flushed with copious amounts of water. The use of antiseptics is not contraindicated, but may not be beneficial. Similarly, no evidence exists to suggest that squeezing the site of the injury to express fluid reduces the risk of transmission. An accident report should be completed with as much information as possible (date and time of exposure; details of the procedure being performed and the device being used; the type of exposure; the type and amount of fluid/tissue involved in the exposure; the infectious status of the source; and the susceptibility of the exposed person). Details about counseling, postexposure management and follow-up also are important. In general, no postexposure prophylaxis is indicated for contamination of unbroken skin or for those who inadvertently share food or utensils with a person who is infected with HBV or HCV unless there are extenuating circumstances. In the event of a human bite, both the person bitten and the person who did the biting should be evaluated. If the infection status of the source patient is known, this may be sufficient to confirm or exclude risk to the exposed person. If the infection status is not known, the source patient should be tested for HBV and HCV after obtaining an informed consent. Testing should be performed without delay by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Tests can be modified to detect HBsAg within 2 hours. A negative anti-HCV or HBsAg result is an excellent indicator that the blood-borne pathogen is not present. The likelihood that the source person may be in the preseroconversion window period of their infection is extremely small. Confirmation of the reactive results with a supplemental test should be done to complete the testing process, but are not necessary to make initial decisions regarding postexposure management. Direct viral assays (HBV DNA and HCV RNA) are not recommended for immediate decision making purposes because of the time required to obtain a result, but might be a supplementary consideration. For those situations where the source is unknown or cannot be tested, management should be based on the likelihood of transmission such as the prevalence of disease in a population group from which the contaminated material was derived.",

Conversely, exposed persons who are known not to have responded to the vaccine or to have had an inadequate response should receive HBIG and reinitiate the vaccine series or be given two doses of HBIG at 4-6 week intervals if the source is HBsAg positive or a known high-risk source.

For less than an adequate anti-HBs response, a vaccine booster should be administered along with HBIG if the source is HBsAg positive. Some experts would disagree with delaying treatment in the \"antibody response unknown\" group exposed to an HBsAg positive source until the exposed worker's anti-HBs test results are known. For these individuals, postexposure prophylaxis should be similar to that recommended for the known nonresponder group.

Pre-S/S hepatitis B vaccines produced in mammalian cells have been shown to induce faster and higher seroprotection rates against HBV, using fewer doses as compared to yeast derived vaccines.Recently, it has been suggested that vaccines against HBV may also be usefull for intervention in persistent HBV infection. Preliminary data obtained in limited clinical trials, suggest that some HBV vaccines may suppress HBV replication when administered repeatedly to patients with persistent HBV infection and hepatocellular injury. Efficacy of such an intervention, remain to be explored. Introduction of new adjuvants instead of alum may induce cellular and humoral immune responses designed to bypass immune tolerance to HBV.",

Numerous studies from Asia provide strong evidence that HBV genotype B is associated with less active and more slowly progressive liver disease compared with genotype C. This may be related to the observations that patients with HBV genotype B undergo spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion at a younger age and are more likely to have sustained remission of liver disease after seroconversion. The relation between other HBV genotypes and activity or progression of liver disease, and HBeAg seroconversion has not been properly examined. Data on the relation between HBV genotypes and HBV replication capacity are also lacking. HBV genotype is closely related to the selection of the precore stop codon mutation (G 1896 A).

To further study on the inside story of the intertypes, a study was carried out with a panel of sera collected from chronic HBV carriers living in various parts of China. The B and C and B/C recombination of 136 sequences were analyzed including 83 by restriction fragment length polymorphism and 53 by phylogenetic tree and bootscanning on full genome (23 in present study and 30 of Chinese origin from GenBank). The results showed that the genotype B in China was exclusively a subgroup of recombination with genotype C and both shared the same pre-C/C fragment. Now that the prototype B was not found in China, it was unlikely that the recombination was from coinfection of B and C. Because in pre-C/C region a number of linear epitopes and mutational hot spots distributed, it is inferred that may be a pattern of mutations. The selection pressure estimated by using a maximum likelihood approach showed that the ratio of nonsynonymousto-synonymous substitutions (d N /d S) varied more extensively in recombined pre-C/C region, providing a strong support to the mutation mechanism. Perhaps, the hybrid B has generated during HBV history and co-evolved with other genotypes over a very long period. The original B was running away under immune pressure, and the hybrid B, which seemed to possess higher evolutionary potential, was gradually becoming the exclusive B prevalent with genotype C in China.",

Subsequently the development of the antiviral lamivudine suggested that the side effects of interferons may disadvantage them despite their superior efficacy. However viral resistance due to mutations has hindered lamivudine and a recent EASL consensus meeting recommended interferon as first line therapy for moderate or severe chronic hepatitius B. Newer antivirals also have potential for viral resistance although perhaps less frequently. Since the pathogenesis of HBV is immune mediated, efforts to lead to HBeAg seroconversion have involved immune therapies. Other immune agents such as IL12 were not effective. Therapeutic vaccines have considerable promise but are still in trials. The Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response to HBV peptides is vigorous and multispecific following acute hepatitis in contrast to chronic hepatitis B where it is weak or non-existent. However the use of Dendritic cells, the professional antigen presenting cells, produced in vitro by the use of IL 4 and GM CSF and HBV peptides, has been able to reverse this anergy in vitro. Despite their promise this would be very labour intensive in vivo. The development of the pegylated interferons and their superior efficacy in chronic hepatitis C has lead to their application in chronic hepatitis B. There have been several trials to date. The first study used the larger Peginterferon (Peginterferon alfa2a 40Kd) for 6 months in 193 patients in the Asian Pacific region and showed superior efficacy when compared with conventional interferon alfa2a. HBeAg seroconversion rates were 37% and 33% at 90mg and 180mg Peginterferon compared with 25% with conventional interferon. Peginterferon gave better results in difficult groups -High DNA, ALT<2xULN, and Genotype C. A preliminary report of a trial from Hong Kong using Peginterferon alfa2b (12KD) in 40 patients with HBeAg positive disease suggested combination of Peginterferon and lamivudine was superior to Peginterferon alone. However a larger European study of 266 patients (20% Asian) receiving Peginterferon Alfa2b (12KD) in combination with lamivudine for 12 months or Peginterferon alone showed no difference 6 months after stopping therapy for HBeAg seroconversion (36% vs 35%), DNA<200,000 (27% vs 32%), or normalization of ALT (32% vs 35%). Similarly, a multinational study of 537 HBeAg negative patients showed no benefit of combination therapy of Peginterferon alfa2a(40KD) and lamivudine for 12 months compared with Peginterferon alone 6 months after stopping therapy with 60% and 59% of patients having normal ALT and DNA<20,000 copies in 44% and 43%. Results with lamivudine were lower at 44% for normal ALT and 29% DNA <20,000. In conclusion, Peginterferons have superior efficacy than conventional interferon or lamivudine. Combination of lamivudine and Peginterferon may be no better than Peginterferon alone. The pendulum of antiviral agents or immune agents appears to be swinging back towards interferons (PEG) especially in younger patients.",

Over the natural history of chronic hepatitis B (the immune tolerance phase; the immune elimination phase; the non-replicative phase), the disease spectrum covers chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the context of therapeutic intervention, for each antiviral drug selection pressure (eg. lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir) that is introduced, escape mutants are selected from the pre-existing pool of quasispecies. In the clinical context, the emergence of drug-resistant HBV has now been associated with worsening liver function, progressive liver disease, serious acute exacerbations of hepatic flares, hepatic decompensation and even death. In immune compromised patients, this process is often rapidly accelerated, presumably due to the higher replication rates as well as lack of immunological control. Antiviral drug resistant mutants emerge as a function of at least six factors: the viral mutation frequency, the intrinsic mutability of the antiviral target site, the selective pressure exerted by the drug, the magnitude and rate of virus replication, the overall replication fitness of the mutant and the availability of replication space. All of the drug-specific mutations for each agent have been mapped to the viral polymerase (Pol). Because of the overlap of the reading frames of the HBV Pol with the frame-shifted hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), drug-resistant mutations in the HBV Pol can directly impact on the nature of HBsAg and its function, including properties of viral neutralization. Drug resistant HBV can behave as a vaccine escape mutant and cases of transmission of drugresistant HBV have now been reported. Clearly, improved treatment strategies are urgently required to prevent the continued selection of HBV drug-resistant mutants, otherwise inadequately treated patients and the wider community will suffer the subsequent disastrous consequences.

Despite the use of these anti-viral agents at the time of clinical hepatitis, some HBsAg positive patients still developed hepatic failure and died. This is probably related to the late institution of the nucleoside analogues when the immunemediated liver damage has already been established. Hence, it is now generally accepted that nucleoside analogues should be administered pre-emptively before the onset of hepatitis due to HBV virological reactivation. Our recent data suggested that \"early\" is preferable to \"delay\" pre-emptive therapy to initiate lamivudine in these settings. Currently, there are a number of new nucleoside analogues such as adefovir, entecavir, emtricitabine, clevudine, b-L-thymidine, b-L-Fd4C or non-nucleoside analogues such as the phenylpropenamide derivatives AT-61 and AT-130, in the anti-HBV pipeline. Further clinical trials with the use of these nucleoside analogues will be needed to determine their antiviral efficacy in the hepatitis B patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

Nucleoside analogue therapy results in effective suppression of HBV replication and improved clinical parameters of liver disease, but the effect on patient survival and the risk of drug resistance remained obscure. Quantitative HBV DNA assays allow earlier detection of increased viral replication, before the onset of biochemical abnormality. We have combined serial HBV DNA monitoring with pre-emptive lamivudine therapy, so that kidney transplant recipients with increasing levels of HBV DNA will be started on lamivudine therapy. Our results showed that this strategy markedly improved patient survival to simulate that of HBsAg-negative subjects. Improved liver biochemistry was noted in all patients who had elevated transaminase levels at the time of starting treatment. Prolonged treatment was however associated with the selection of drug resistant YMDD variants. Hepatitic flares were common after the development of drug resistance, and could lead to decompensation in a small proportion of patients.

Neuropathologic studies of brain tissue from patients who died in hepatic coma show swelling of mitochondria and margination of chromatin in non-neuronal elements, particularly glial cells (astrocytes). Novel insights into pathophysiologic mechanisms continue to be provided by molecular techniques such as differential display / RT-PCR and gene chip microarrays. Using such techniques, alterations in expression of genes coding for essential brain proteins have been reported in both experimental and human HE. Such proteins include the astrocytic structural protein GFAP, the glial glutamate and glycine transporters EAAT-2 and GLYT-1 and the mitochondrial \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR). Exposure of primary glial cell cultures to liver-derived toxins such as ammonia and manganese results in a similar pattern of alterations of gene expression. Gene \"knock-down\" of EAAT-2 leads to brain edema and hyperexcitability, features which are characteristic of liver failure. Loss of expression of EAAT-2 and GLYT-1 in experimental liver failure leads to increased extracellular brain concentrations of the neuroactive amino acids glutamate and glycine; increased PTBR mRNA, on the other hand, results in increased synthesis of neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone with potent neuroinhibitory properties. Accumulation in brain of these neuroactive substances could contribute to the pathogenesis of HE in acute and chronic liver failure [funded by the CIHR Canada].",

            "text": "The replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a well-organized process, which involves alternating use between DNA and RNA in the viral genome. The viral DNA polymerase which plays a major role in this process is composed of four domains and starting from the N-terminus they are the terminal protein (TP), a spacer region which has not been associated with a specific function, the reverse trasncriptase (RT) and the RNase H, which digests the RNA in RNA-DNA hybrids. Since HBV has its own replicating polymerase, a number of nucleoside analogues have been developed as antiviral drugs targeting at this enzyme. The precise targets of HBV polymerase are at the YMDD motif of the C domain, which is at the catalytic site, or at the B domain in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Two major approaches have been used to analyze the functions of HBV polymerase. One is the molecular approach, which is to establish cloning and expression systems for direct analysis of the polymerase function without involving other HBV viral proteins. The other is to study the functions of polymerase in naturally occurring full-length viral genomes isolated from patients. Employing the second approach we have reported two full-length HBV genomes with high homology in nucleic acid sequences (98.7%) but replicated at high and low virus loads (#56, high replicative, #2-18, low replicative) in patients. To study the structural basis for this difference in replicative competency, chimeric constructs were generated by substitution of the TP, spacer, RT and RNase H genes in #2-18 by those from #56 respectively. Replicative competency was studied using these chimeric constructs by cell transfection, and only when residue 652 was changed from serine to proline, the replicative competency could be enhanced. Compared to the RT model of HIV, computer modeling of HBV RT suggested that residue 652 is located at the connecting loop or the hinge between the two helices of the thumb domain of RT. Since these two helices were predicted to form part of a translocation tract, which controls the relative movement of the polymerase, the rigidity of residue 652 constrains the formation and/or position of the two helices. Proline is more rigid, while serine is more flexible. A change from proline to serine at residue 652 could disrupt the relative conformation of the helices and thus would affect the polymerase activity (J Virol, 2001 75:11827).",

These mutants were separately used to transfect HepG2 cells, and replicative competencies of these mutants were assayed by real-time PCR. Results showed that changes in the hydrophilicity of amino acid at residue 652 did not affect the replicative competency. While, when proline was mutated to glycine, which has a simple structure, which could confer the hinge with higher flexibility, significant decreased replicative competency was observed. In contrast, when proline was mutated to amino acids with hydroxyl groups (Asp, Glu), the replicative competency of these mutants was higher than that of the wild-type virus. The highest replicative competency was found when proline was changed to glutamine, which suggests that the number of hydroxyl groups and the length of side chains in the structure of amino acid at 652 are associated with high replicative competency. The mechanisms of the enhanced replicative competency could possibly be due to formation of hydrogen bonds of the side chains of glutamine with other adjacent amino acids to constrain the conformation of the helices, resulting in higher replicative competency.",

The proportion has grown steadily since 1991 and now accounts for over 40% of LT. This trend is projected to continue for another 2 decades. HCV infection recurs in all patients after LT and results in fibrosis in half after 5 years. The severity of recurrent HCV after LT may be related to the level of HCV RNA at the time of LT. Antiviral treatment before LT may decrease HCV RNA and reduce the risk of or severity of recurrence, but is difficult to administer. Many patients have contraindications to therapy and about 80% of those treated require dose reductions. Growth factors may help prevent dose reductions. Nonetheless, eradication of virus during therapy occurs in 20-40% and recurrence after transplantation may not occur in these cases. The severity of HCV recurrence appears to be worse if the donor is elderly or living, and consideration must be given to excluding such donors. Immunosuppression after LT accelerates liver injury. Thus, preemptive strategies to reduce the incidence or severity of recurrence have been developed including immunoglobulin, early antiviral treatment, and rapid steroid withdrawal. Pilot studies with neutralizing antibodies directed against HCV have not been encouraging, but the doses studied so far are low. Early interferon treatment when HCV levels are low and clinical disease is not yet apparent might prevent later graft injury. A large study of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is about to start, but drug tolerance during the early weeks after LT will be problematic. Treatment of established recurrence of chronic hepatitis after LT is difficult since most patients have genotype 1, high HCV RNA levels, and some degree of fibrosis. Furthermore, anemia and cytopenia are common because of the effects of medications and pre-existing hypersplenism. Low dose treatment must be started cautiously and increased as tolerated. Dose reductions are required in about 70%, but sustained viral clearance is possible in 20-30%. In summary, interferon-based regimens are the only available option for treating HCV in the transplant setting but therapy is difficult and response is much less than in non-immunosuppressed patients. Certainly, better strategies are needed to control HCV infection in the transplantation setting.",

Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) is the first effective prophylactic agent but the drug is costly and may not be completely effective. The initial success of lamivudine monoprophylaxis was overshadowed by concerns with the emergence of viral mutants and combination therapy adding HBIg to lamivudine has become a widely adopted approach. The newer nucleoside analogs such as adefovir appear most promising and a combination of two or more antiviral agents may be the future prophylactic strategy of choice. The current HBV prophylactic regimen at Queen Mary Hospital focuses on nucleoside analogs and consists of lamivudine monotherapy with adefovir reserved for breakthrough reinfection before or after LTx. With the extended experience of 176 patients who underwent LTx with lamivudine monoprophylaxis, the overall patient survival was 89.2% at a median follow-up of 23 months. Fifteen (8.5%) patients developed breakthrough reinfection with YMDD mutant which was effectively controlled with adefovir. Since lamivudineresistant mutants were more common in HBV genotype C than genotype B (2-year mutant rate 23.6% vs 0%, p=0.009), it may be worthwhile to consider adding adefovir to lamivudine prophylaxis in patients with genotype C. Our recent report on observation of active production of anti-HBs after LTx suggests the possibility of adoptive transfer of immunity against HBV from an immune donor through a liver graft. A novel strategy of active immunisation of a living donor before transplantation is currently under investigation. The idea of active immunisation after transplantation is also attractive but the results have been conflicting to date. The most cost-effective prophylactic strategy remains to be defined. ",

However, endoscopic therapy does not reduce the portal pressure. There is sufficient evidence to support the use of combination of beta-blockers and nitrates as an equally effective and safe alternative to endoscopic therapy of variceal bleeding.",

This makes primary prophylaxis, or prevention of initial variceal bleeding an important therapeutic goal. The options currently available for the same are beta-blockade, and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). Non-selective beta blockade has been reported to be effective in prevention of first variceal bleed. There are however multiple problems in the use of beta-blockers. Around 15% of the patients have contraindications, another 15-20% experience side effects to beta-blockers. Of the remaining, at least 25-30% patients do not achieve adequate reduction in portal pressure to the level required to prevent bleeding. Other problems with beta-blockers are the lack of patient compliance, need for lifelong therapy and the increased risk of bleeding after the cessation of therapy. EVL has been shown to be better than beta-blockers in primary prophylaxis in a previous trial from our center. In recent meta analyses, EVL reduced the risk for first variceal bleed but had no effect on mortality as compared to beta-blockers. It has been observed in very recent studies that while a combination of EVL and beta-blockers is as effective as either of these treatments alone; the combination is superior in prevention of variceal recurrence.",

Tumor expression of VEGF has been shown to correlate with tumor invasiveness and intrahepatic metastasis.

Liver specimens were collected at 2, 6, 12, 24, 30, 48, 72, 120, 168 and 240 h after PH or SO. SIRPa1 expression was determined in mRNA level by Northern blotting as well as in protein level via immunohistochemical staining. SO treatment did not induce remarkable changes in SIRPa1 expression, however, the level of a 3.9kb transcript for SIRPa1 was significantly upregulated after PH (vs SO, p<0.05). SIRPa1 mRNA level in the regenerating liver displayed a biphasic response with its first large peak at as early as 12 hours followed by a second phase of upregulation from 48 to 120 hours post-PH. 168 hours later, SIRPa1 mRNA level returned to its physiological level. As seen from immunohistochemistry experiment, SIRPa1 protein mainly located in membrane and was expressed uniquely in regenerating hepatocytes. Similarly, PH-induced overexpression for SIRPa1 protein occurred between 12 and 168 hours with a peak level at 24 hours after surgery. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SIRPa1 may play an important role in controlling early hepatocytes proliferating cycles. Unlike those early response genes such as c-fos and c-myc, SIRPa1 may be involved in the regulation of liver regeneration in a negative fashion. As we known, liver regeneration is regulated by a perfect cooperation of various proteins, including positive and negative regulators that are almost simultaneously activated, for a well-tuned control on proliferative initiation and termination. To date, liver regeneration has been largely focused on the positive regulators while little is known for the negative regulators. As negative regulator, SIRPa1 may cooperate with other specific candidates in terminating the proliferative signals to prevent excessive proliferation of liver cells.",

This model also indicates that the primary tumor should start off benign but, over time, acquire mutations that provide a few rare cells within the tumor the ability to metastasize. Likewise, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is expected to follow a multi-step process. We have been using DNA microarray and SAGE to define molecular signatures during HCC progression. Our strategy is to identify cellular genes that are commonly changed by the expression of HBV or HCV in primary human hepatocytes, preneoplastic chronic liver disease and HCC. By comparing cirrhotic liver samples from chronic liver disease patients from various etiological factors, we have identified a molecular signature that may be useful in diagnosing patients at risk for developing HCC. By comparing primary HCC with or without accompanying metastasis, we have identified a molecular signature that can identify HCC patients with potential in developing metastasis or recurrence.",

This data suggests that a high rate of malignant changes took place in premalignant tissues prior to clonal expansion. Second, we found that the gene expression signature of primary HCCs with accompanying metastasis was very similar to that of their corresponding metastases, while the molecular signature differs significantly in primary HCC with or without metastasis. These results indicate that most of the metastasis genes are embedded in the primary tumors and that the ability to metastasize is an inherent quality of the tumor from the beginning. The above findings challenge our current view on HCC progression. Using the above approaches, we have identified several diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets that can eliminate liver cancer cells or stop metastatic progression. These studies also provide us with a strategy that may be useful in the future to tailor HCC patients, based on their gene expression profiles, to adjuvant therapy.

The former is at least partly responsible for loss of the genome stability at both gross and fine levels and the later has been implicated as the key alternative to the genetic alteration for the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene in tumors. The hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most threatening cancerous diseases in China, for both its high incidences and the difficulties in early diagnosis and the poor prognosis by the existing treatments. To understand the epigenetic mechanisms ( more specifically, DNA methylation) in HCC carcinogenesis and develop the novel robust diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools, we have methylation-profiled forty four known genes in twenty eight HCC tissues, the neighboring normal tissues as well as four normal liver tissues from the healthy donors. The same efforts have been devoted to the astrocytoma, colon and lung cancers. We concluded from such the rather intensive methylation profiling survey: 1, the tumor associated epigenetic aberrations is global, would also affect the genes with no demonstrated roles in carcinogenesis. 2, the correlation between the changes in the methylation patterns and of the clinicalpathological parameters (cirrhosis in particular) has be recognized and may have certain clinical implications. 3, the MAGE1A gene is hypermethylated and lacking of expression in the normal liver and hypomethylated and over-expressed in HCC at the high frequency, probably representing the first case of the tumor associated hypomethylated promoter CpG island in connection with the gene expression. And 4, the concordant behavior of methylation among all the informative targets can be extrapolated with the necessary mathematic treatments and can be used for the target selection in the future DNA methylation based prognostic and diagnostic tools for the human tumors.

From a practical standpoint, in this study we focused our efforts on attracting antigen presenting cells to the site of antigen existed, increasing expression of transgenic product, enhancing antigen presentation and activating APC.",

Although liver resection is the optimal strategy for liver cancer, low resectability and high postoperative recurrence rate remain to be the main barriers for favorable long-term survival. Therefore, comprehensive treatments for PLC, which aims at improving the overall therapeutic efficacy, has been the focus of clinical work and research: (1) The volume of liver removal: as anatomical or extended hepatectomy may result in severe decompensation of liver function, modality of liver resection has been shifted from extended resection to irregular radical local resection. Substantial clinical practices have shown that in patients with liver cancer associated with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, radical local resection not only increased resectability but significantly decreased operative mortality and achieved long-term outcomes similar to, or even better than those achieved by extended resection.",

In our studies, the 2-and 3-year survival rates were 73.1 percent and 47.5 percent respectively. (4) Two-stage resection: comprehensive therapies for shrinking liver tumors available at present include TACE, PEI, RFA and cryotherapy, etc. Rational use of these techniques is crucial for tumor shrinkage. Two-stage resection is indicative for those definitely unresectable tumors, and otherwise one-stage removal is still recommended to be the optimal choice in the management of liver cancer. (6) Prevention and treatments for postoperative recurrence of liver cancer: intraoperative preventive measures, postoperative comprehensive therapies against recurrence, and early detection and management of possible recurrent lesions are important strategies to improve the therapeutic effects. Fine surgical manipulation to avoid medical dissemination, non-touch technique, suction of cancerous thrombi and portal chemotherapy are essential for prevention of recurrence. Rational use of the comprehensive therapies according to the specific conditions of individual patients is of critical importance. B-US, AFP and chest X-ray should be performed regularly.",

Reoperation is an effective strategy for the improvement of 5-year survival rate for both recurrent tumors amendable to surgical operation. In our data, the 5-year survival rates after a second and third operation are 46.6 percent and 25 percent respectively. (7) Liver transplantation: previous series concerning OLT in liver cancer demonstrated a poor long-term survival because most recipients selected for OLT were patients with terminal stage of unresectable tumors and immunosuppression treatment was liable to accelerate growth of the liver cancer or promote tumor recurrence. For small liver cancers, transplants eliminate both detectable and undetectable tumor nodes and all preneoplastic lesions in the cirrhotic liver. Removal of the diseased liver also reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality from portal hypertension. At present, liver cancer is still an indication of liver transplantation, where relatively better long-term survival can be expected for early stage liver cancer, incidental cancer and fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. OLT is selective for patients with tumors less than 5cm in diameter that show no vascular invasion, decompensated liver cirrhosis or contraindications for resection. Satisfactory OLT outcomes may be expected in stage II or III liver cancers providing that perioperative treatment is meticulous enough. OLT is contraindicated for late stage liver cancer. (8) Non-surgical interventions: on patients with liver cancer who can't accept operation for various reasons, TACE, PEI, or RFA may have resulted in favorable outcomes. Attentions are essentially placed on the sequences of various interventional therapies. The action of TACE depends on the tumor artery, whereas PEI , RFA and other procedures may destroy the vascular system of tumor. Therefore, TACE is essential to be preferential. In summary, comprehensive treatments has become a more important strategy for improving the overall therapeutic effect on liver cancer. Two principles should be keep in mind: (1) attention should be devoted to the complimentary effects of each method. (2) avoiding the counteraction of the effects or the accumulation of side effects.",

            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tends to invade the portal vein resulting in the formation of portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). PVTT was proved to be an important negative prognostic indicator of this disease. From January 1998 to December 2002, 917 patients with liver cancer after liver resection were enrolled in our study. Of these, 797 patients (86.9%) had PVTT if all degrees of portal vein are included and 139 patients (15.2%) had gross PVTT (PVTT in portal trunk, its first-order branches and its second-order branches). The diagnosis of gross PVTT was verified mainly by image technical such as ultrasound, CT or MRI. The existence of gross PVTT was confirmed by preoperative image in 92 cases (66.2%), intraoperative exploration in 32 cases (23.0%), and histopathological examination in 15 cases (10.8%). Although PVTT in portal trunk may be from the HCC located in different segments (34/139, 24.5%), it was mainly caused by tumor in right lobe (21/80,15.1%). Tumor usually invaded the portal vein in same side. It is rarely seen that tumor in right lobe infiltrated left portal branch (3/80, 0.04%) and tumor in left lobe protruded to the opposite-side portal branch (2/36, 0.06%). Hepatocellular carcinoma seemed to be easier to invade the portal vein than cholangiocarcinoma or mixed type, as the incidence rate of PVTT in each type was 15.86%, 4.44%, 9.52% respectively, but they had no significent difference. While the tumor size has closed relationship with PVTT incidence in this series because the incidence rates was 7.6% (\u00a33cm), 7.72% (3~5cm), 16.4% (5~10cm) and 22.4% (e\"10cm), respectively. The incidence rate showed significant difference when taking 5cm as critical point (p0.01). In this series, all patients received hepatectomy and intraoperative chemotherapy via portal vein. PVTT resection or aspiration was performed in 124 patients who had the presence of gross PVTT. However, the reapperence of gross PVTT was detected in 79% patients within 60 days after operation, with even more serious symptoms. In view of the limitations of surgery in the management of recurrent PVTT, the new therapeutic approach has been developed on the basis of minimally invasive therapy. In this study, 65 cases were randomized separated into three group treated with different modalities including LA (laser ablation, n=24), TACE (n=20) and PPVC (percutaneous portal vein chemoembolization, n=9). the regression of PVTT and the reappearance of portal vein flow detected by color Doppler Ultrasonograpy were used as evaluating criterion for the effecacy of therapy. The regression of PVTT and the continuous reappearance of blood stream in patients treated with LA, TACE, PPVC was 92.3%, 10%, 26.3% respectively 30d after therapy, and 75%, 15.38%, 35.3% respectively 90d after therapy. Our study suggested LA might be an effective new therapeutic modality for PLC with portal trunk and its main branches tumor thrombus, although its long effects remain to be further studied.",

            "text": "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has been recognized as an entity of liver disease since 1950s. Histopathology shows features of progressive non-suppurative destructive cholangitis that ultimately leads to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Although its exact pathogenesis still remains unknown, autoreactivity to intrahepatic bile duct system is believed to be the principal mechanism. In Western and Northern Europe the estimated disease prevalence varies between 20 and 240 cases per million population and an incidence between 4 and 30 cases per million per year; furthermore, the incidence of PBC appears to be rising. However, in China, PBC had been ignored and underdiagnosed for many years, probably because of the misconception that PBC was mainly involved Caucasians and the unaccessibility to specific laboratory tests. As the accessibility to world medical literature and academic exchanges have become easier and more frequent, and the wide-spread use of automatic biochemical analysis and availability of anti-mitochondrial antibody( AMA) detection, we and other Chinese hepatolgists began to realized that the PBC is much more common than we thought before. In recent years, at least more than 400 hundred cases of PBC have been reported in the mainland of China (mainly in Chinese medical literature). Actually in our own institute and one other hospital, each more than 100 hundred cases have been diagnosed in the last 5 to 10 years. As in western countries, in China PBC is predominantly affects women, with a peak age of about 50 years. The earlier series was consisted of mainly older late stage cases which had been undiagnosed until occurrence of overt jaundice, even until the development of portal hypertension and liver failure. Recent series comprised of more and more younger and earlier and even asymptomatic cases accidently identified at routine health check or workup for other medical problems. The clinical manifestation (such as fatigue, pruritus, dry mouth and eyes), biochemical( such as increased alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), immunological (such as increased immunoglobulin M and AMA/AMA-M2 positivity) as well as histological (such as bile duct inflammation and destruction, dense lymphocyte infiltration in portal area and granuloma formation) features of reported Chinese cases are more or less the same as the cases reported in western countries. The biochemical response to medical therapy, namely high oral dose of ursodeoxycholic acid, was also similar to that reported in western literature, although large scale clinical trials or even retrospective series on the long-term efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid are sill lacking. In China Orthotopic liver transplantion also has become the treatment of choice for end-stage PBC patients and not surprisingly, post-transplant survival profile was very good. Interestingly, we found some cases with typical biochemical, immunological and histological features of PBC also had markers of hepatitis B virus infecton. They showed evidences of either past( positive for anti-HBs and/or anti-HBc) or current (positive for HBsAg)HBV infection, but usually with undetectable HBV-DNA by PCR amplyfication. The causal relationship, if there is at all, between PBC and HBV infection remains to be investigated. In conclusion, because of an increased awareness of PBC among doctors and the availability of diagnostic tests, especially the measurement of AMA/AMA-M2, more and more PBC cases have been diagnosed and timely treated with internationally accepted medical and surgical modalities.",

            "text": "In the past two decades, alpha interferon (IFN-a) has been proven effective in the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B virus infections. However, the antiviral mechanism of IFN-a and the biological function of many IFN-a responsive genes have not been fully elucidated. To study the global effect of IFN-a on cellular genes and its interaction with HBV, we used cDNA microarray filters dotted with 14,000 human genes to analyze transcriptional changes between an HBV DNA transfected hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2.2.15) and its parental cell line (HepG2) pre-and post IFN-a treatment. Analysis of gene profiles revealed that the mRNA expression level of myeloid differential primary response protein MyD88 (MyD88) was reduced in the HBV persistently infected HepG2.2.15 cells compared with HepG2 cells, and this could not be restored by the treatment with IFN-a. This result suggested that the expression of MyD88 was inhibited by HBV and the interplay between MyD88 and HBV might account for the establishment of viral persistence. This also suggested that MyD88 protein could play an important role in antiviral activity against HBV. To examine the role of MyD88 in the antiviral activity of IFN-a against hepatitis B virus (HBV), we established MyD88 stably expressing cell lines and studied HBV replication in these lines after transient transfection. The levels of HBV proteins and viral replicative intermediates were effectively reduced in MyD88 expressing cells. And a significant reduction of total and cytoplasmic viral RNAs in MyD88 stable expressing cells was also observed. Using a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) dependent reporter assay, it was shown that activation of NF-kB was moderately increased in the presence of expression of MyD88, and further significantly increased by co-expression of HBV. These results suggest a novel mechanism for the inhibition of HBV replication by IFN-a via expression of MyD88 protein involving activation of NF-kB signaling pathway and down regulation of viral transcription. Another important implication of above results is that the novel antiviral genes identified by microarrays could be potentially developed as new anti-HBV drug or for novel therapies.",

To develop a new therapeutic approach, we investigated the potential of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated stable heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in the interference of fibrogenesis of chronic liver diseases. Over-expression of HO-1 in the liver by rAAV/HO-1 markedly reduced the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension in a micronodular liver cirrhosis model. This finding was accompanied with improved liver biochemistry and fewer infiltrating macrophages and activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in rAAV/HO-1-transduced livers. The anti-fibrogenic effects of the rAAV/HO-1 approach were partly through the over-expression of HO-1 in activated HSCs. HO-1 and its enzymatic product, carbon monoxide, could suppress the collagen synthesis and the proliferation of activated HSCs isolated from injury livers in a cell culture system. Administration of rAAV/HO-1 to cirrhotic livers could promote the resolution process of fibrotic tissue and attenuate the severity of fibrosis in the presence of etiologic agent for long term. These data provide the direct evidence of enhanced liver HO enzymatic activity in the control of the development of liver cirrhosis, and support the clinical application of rAAV in the treatment of liver cirrhosis.",

Conventionally, predictive factors for metastasis and relapse after the surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) consist morphological (both gross and histological) features of the tumor, including TNM staging, tumor cell grading, capsule, and vessel invasion, etc. However, sometimes, these can not exactly reflect the biological features of HCC and patients' outcome. A complementary way is to analyze molecular markers (biomarkers) for their significance with reference to metastasis and recurrence of cancer. In recent years, with the development of cellular and molecular biological techniques, many biomarkers related to invasion, metastasis, recurrence and survival have been explored in authors' institute. Many biomarkers have been found to be related to the invasiveness and metastasis of HCC. One group is positive related factors, including p16 and p53 mutations, H-ras, c-erbB2, mdm2, TGF-a, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MMP-2, uPA, uPA-R and PAI-1, ICAM-1, VEGF, PD-ECGF, bFGF, and osteopontin (OPN), etc. The other group is negative related factors, including nm23-H1, Kai-1, TIMP-2, integrin a5, E-cadherin, etc. These factors could be potential predictive markers for the metastasis and recurrence of HCC. Serum VEGF, ICAM-1 and PAI-1 levels were higher in patients with metastasis than those without metastasis, while serum Thrombomodulin concentration negatively associated with the intrahepatic spreading and portal vein thrombi of HCC. Overexpression of MMP-2, VEGF, TGF-a, and EGFR in HCC tissues, and LOH on chromosome 14q (D14S62 and D14S51) in plasma DNA were also related to metastatic recurrence of HCC patients. p53 mutation or nuclear accumulation of p53 expression could be a valuable marker for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients after resection.

Many regions with increased-grade AI in metastatic lesions were 4q21-22, 4q32-qter, 8p23.3, 8p11.2, 8q24.1, 9p11, 9q31, 11q23.1, 13q14.1-31, 13q32-qter, 16p13.3, 16q13, 16q22, 17p11.2-13.1 and 19p13.1, which were considered metastasis phenotype related.

These provide some candidate regions for further study to identify putative metastasis suppressor genes of HCC.

Eleven of them were found to be significantly down-regulated in the MHCC97-H cells with higher metastatic potential. One full length gene, HTPAP, was obtained from one differently expressed EST. In vitro study, we found the HTPAP gene transfection could significantly suppress the invasion activity of HCC cell. The in vivo functional analysis of this gene is performing.",

A characteristic early decline of serum HCV RNA is observed when this equilibrium is disturbed by interferon a. Mathematical analyses of the viral decline during the initial phase of interferon treatment resulted in the estimation of a very short half-life of free hepatitis C virions in vivo (< 5 h), and indicated that the rapid first phase (day 1) of the initial decline relates to the decay of free virus particles, whereas the much slower second phase (\u2248 day 2) of the initial decline reflects clearance of productively infected cells. Both first-phase und second-phase slopes and the extent of viral decline after 24 hours have been shown to depend on HCV genotype and to be larger for patients with HCV genotype non-1 than for patients with genotype HCV-1. A significant improvement in sustained virologic response rates has been achieved in HCV-1 infected patients by the long-acting pegylated interferons. Kinetic analyses indicated that treatment with peginterferon a may reinforce the death rate of infected cells particularly in HCV-1 infected patients and/or stabilize the therapeutic effect on viral production. These kinetic analyses are central to our current understanding of antiviral therapy and have influenced approaches towards treatment of patients with chronic viral hepatitis.",

By phylogenetic analysis of hepatitis B viral (HBV) isolates, 8 different genotypes (A to H) have been recognized worldwide. Most of the HBV genotypes have a specific geographic distribution, with predominance of genotypes A and D in North America, Western Europe and India, B and C in the Southeast Asia and Far East including Taiwan, and F in South America. The distribution of genotypes E, G and H is less well studied. The impact of HBV genotypes on the clinical aspects of HBV infection including clinical outcome of chronic infection and therapeutic response to antiviral treatments has been clarified. In Taiwan, genotype C is associated with more severe liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and genotype B is associated with the development of HCC in young non-cirrhotic patients. In contrast, genotype B has a relatively good prognosis in Japan and China and is rarely associated with the development of HCC. Similarly, genotype D is associated with more severe liver disease than genotype A in India and may predict occurrence of HCC in young patients. Serologically, genotype C tends to have a higher frequency of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positivity and a higher serum HBV DNA level than genotype B. In addition, genotype C patients, compared to genotype B patients, have a delayed HBeAg seroconversion in the immune clearance phase of chronic HBV infection. Although superinfection of HBV on top of hepatitis B carriers occurs, it is rarely associated with acute exacerbations. Virologically, genotype C bears a higher frequency of core promoter mutation than genotype B, and patients with core promoter mutation are more associated with the development of HCC than those without, which apply to both genotypes B and C. As to the response to antiviral treatment, genotypes C and D are associated with a lower response rate to interferon therapy compared with genotypes B and A. Compared to genotype C, genotype B may have a more durable HBeAg response to lamivudine therapy. However, both genotypes have a similar virologic response and risk of developing drug-resistant mutants after 1 year of therapy. These lines of evidence from different Asian countries have lent strong support to possible pathogenic differences between HBV genotypes B and C. In Western countries where genotypes A and D prevail, the clinical and virologic studies also indicated the long-term outcome of chronic hepatitis B is different in patients infected with HBV genotype A, D, or F. These data further help us in understanding the whole picture of patients infected with different HBV genotypes worldwide, and highlight the importance of determining the genotype in patients with chronic HBV infection in our future clinical practice.",

HCV genotype ( in the first 100 consecutive patients) were 1a 57.5%, 1b 10%, 2a 10%, 2b 15%, and 3a 7.5%. Risk factors for HCV transmission for these patients were exchange needle and also tattoo. Fortunately in IDU patients, therapy with interferon in combination with ribavirin gave a better result ( 100 % EOT) compared to non-iDU chronic hepatitis C patients (72.2%). In summary, transmission of HCV and HBV in IDU patients was high, however, the response to therapy was better.",

Current treatment for patients with HBeAg-positive CHB suppress HBV replication, reducing HBV DNA levels to undetectable levels by PCR in 20-30% and resulting in HBeAg seroconversion in 12-20%. Suppression of HBV replication results in improvement in liver biochemical and histological parameters including retardation of, and in some cases, even reversal of fibrosis. Treatment needs to be more precise and tailored to suit patient types. Information on the natural history, genotype, HBeAg status of patients, of co-infection with other viruses, underling medical condition and others can help determine response rates. HBV Genotypes may help determine choice of therapeutic agents as some types appear to respond better with immunomodulatory agents. It is becoming clearer now that the most important factor that cause disease progression is prolonged, low level viremia. The challenge is to choose the most appropriate patients and provide them with the most appropriate treatment, given the limitations of the current therapeutic modalities and evolution of new drugs and information on factors that may determine treatment response. Treatment of HBeAg-positive CHB is either with Lamivudine (LAM) or Interferon. LAM is the best known NA but has limitations especially the development of YMDD resistant mutants. Other drugs such as Adefovir and Tenofovir have emerged to treat LAM-resistant mutants. Treatment of HBeAg-negative Chronic hepatitis B patients is also challenging. Earlier treatments suppress HBV replication and biochemical or histological activity but seldom attain sustained responses. Long term treatment may result in a more sustained response in some patients (< 20%). At present nucleoside analogues (NA) that do not cause resistance in the long term may be an option for this group of patients. NA can be considered for patients with decompensated cirrhosis. NA can prevent decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Trials of Pegylated IFN are in progress, both as monotherapy as well as combination. Results of these ongoing trials will have an impact on the future role of IFN in CHB. Other agents that are being studied include Entecavir, Emtricitabine, Telbivudine, and Valtocitabine. Combination treatment will be expected to be beneficial as a means of limiting resistance and achieving additive or synergistic efficacy.

Even DC has been found for more than one century, its scarcity in peripheral blood has hindered the research of DC. It's since the methods for in vitro amplification of DC were developed in the 1990's, which were based on a cocktail of cytokines, that we had more opportunity to understand the basic biology and clinic science of DC. IL-4 and GM-CSF are the major cytokines used in the protocol. The source of DC includes peripheral blood, cord blood and bone marrow. A successful culture can be identified through FACS, microscope, electron microscope and functional test (such as MLR). A lot of papers have showed that in the body of animal models or patients with viral disease or tumor, the quantity and quality of DC descended. In vitro amplificated and antigen-pulsed DC have been used in clinic trials. The targets of therapy include the virus (such as HIV or HBV etc.) and tumor (such as carcinoma of prostate, renal carcinoma, melanoma etc.). The selection of antigen is always a pivotal step for successful therapeutical protocol. The patterns of antigen for pulsing include lysate of tumor cells, purified protein, synthesised peptide and related RNA.

Moreover sampling error can occur in 10-20% and inadequate size of specimen strongly reduces the grading and staging of chronic viral hepatitis.

Long-term LAM treatment results in an initial response in 70-90%, however, virologic breakthroughs, i.e., >70% in 5 years, set back initial gains achieved in viral suppression, histologic improvement and may even increase the risks of flares and hepatic decompensation.The introduction of ADV has pushed the management of CHB to a new era as results of recent Phase III trials become available. In 48 weeks of treatment of HBeAg (+) patients, Adefovir 10 g OD achieved 12 % anti-HBe seroconversion rates,. Most importantly, no mutations have been noted in over 460 patients treated. After 96 weeks of therapy, virologic breakthroughs were reported in <2% of patients In HBeAg negative patients, 51% have undetectable HBV-DNA at week 48 of treatment. . In LAM-resistant HBV, ADV achieves a reduction of HBV DNA by 4.04 log(10) copies/mL from baseline. Adding ADV to current LAM treatment once YMDD variants are detected, 52 weeks of combination therapy achieved viral suppression in 85%, ALT normalisation is observed in 31-53%. Similar results were also achieved in ADV treatment of LAM-resistant HBV in pre-and post-liver transplant patients. At 10mg OD, renal toxicity has not been the reason for discontinuing ADV therapy in the trials reported so far. In e-negative CHB, the efficacy of LAM and ADV are almost similar. Currently, the risk benefit profile of ADV is similar with LAM as an initial therapy to CHB. In addition, ADV is a safe and effective rescue drug in the treatment of LAMassociated YMMD variants in compensated, as well as, in pre-and post-transplant patients.",

Treatment options consist of interferon alpha-2b, lamivudine, and adefovir dipivoxil. There are pros and cons in each of these therapies. Many guidelines on CHB management and treatment have been published. Constant updating is required to address important issues on therapeutic options and indications at different stage of the disease, management plan for drug resistant mutations such as lamivudine resistant YMDD mutants, strategy to enhance durability of response, and therapy in specific subgroups. Monotherapy generally has not produced adequate and consistent viral suppression that impact long term clinical outcome. One of the reasons being the persistence of cccDNA in the hepatocytes despite \"response\" as defined by serum HBV DNA levels. An effective immune clearance of infected hepatocytes is essential for durable therapeutic response. This may not be readily achieved without immune modulators. Pegylated interferons (Peg-IFN) have been demonstrated to have superior pharmacokinetic profile in sustaining therapeutic level throughout the duration of treatment. The response rate to Peg-IFN monotherapy is higher when compared to the standard interferon. It is easier to administer and no added side-effects have been reported. Peg-IFN used as a monotherapy or in combination with a nucleoside analogue is being intensely studied in different international clinical trials for both HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative CHB.

The major risk factors include alcohol consumption, exposure to chemicals such as vinyl chloride and dietary aflatoxin B1(AFB1), and chronic infection with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus (HCV). The mechanisms by which HCV infection promotes the development of liver disease remain largely unknown.HCV is a positive-strand RNA virus that is remarkably efficient at establishing chronic infection. Chronic infection of HCV for long lasting periods with liver inflammation is likely important mechanism for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. And, thus, the development of anti-HCV agents is very important to prevent the cancer development.The development of anti-HCV agents has been accelerated by the establishment of cell lines in which HCV genome RNA selfreplicates efficiently (referred to as HCV replicon cells). We have attempted to obtain a candidate for anti-HCV function by screening various drugs that have been currently prescribed to patients with various diseases. Among nearly 100 compounds examined, we observed a suppressive effect of cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppresant, on HCV genome replication. Treatment with 1 micro gram /ml CsA or 100 U/ml IFN alpha (used as a positive control) for 7 days decreased the amount of HCV proteins as well as the amount of HCV RNA to levels undetectable by immunoblot and northern analysis. A similar reduction of HCV protein and RNA synthesis was not observed after treatment with FK506 (1 micro gram /ml) which is another immunosuppresant. These results suggested that CsA inhibited the replication of HCV genome in HCV replicon cells.To demonstrate that the anti-HCV effect of CsA was not specific for the artificially constructed HCV replicon cells but could also be extended to a physiologic HCV replication system, we examined the effect of CsA in a hepatocyte-derived cell line PH5CH8 that was previously shown to be susceptible to HCV infection. PH5CH8 cells were treated with HCV-positive plasma, and the HCV RNA genome titer was quantified by RT-PCR analysis at various times after inoculation. By day 5 postinoculation, the HCV RNA genome titer was approximately 10-fold higher than that on day 1 in the normal condition. However, a significant increase of the HCV RNA genome titer at these time points was not observed in cells treated continuously with CsA or IFNalpha. This result suggested that CsA not only inhibited the replication of HCV genome in HCV replicon cells but also inhibited replication of HCV in cultured hepatocytes.In this symposium I would like to discuss the likely mechanism of CsA to suppress HCV genome replication. To examine the viral factors on the effect of combination therapy with interferon (IFN) and ribavirin on chronic hepatitis C, mutational changes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA before and during the treatment were examined.",

Based on the previous report that X is located in the mitochondria and induces cell death by transfecting the EGFP-fusion constructs of X, we mapped the aa 68 to 117 of X as a region required for mitochondrial localization, but independent of transactivation function. In the cytochemical analysis the mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased by X association with mitochondria. Furthermore, PTP inhibitors, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers and Bcl-xL prevented the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway operated by X.In this study, we employed the protein transduction method to introduce the recombinant X (rX) or its mutant directly into HuH7 cells in concentration dependent manner. We observed the localization of rX in the mitochondria and activation of Erk activity as well. The level of cellular ATP was decreased after rX transduction. The generation of ROS was observed after incubation with rX. Comet assay showed that incubation with rX caused DNA damage, which was protected in the presence of ROS scavengers. DNA damage was then analyzed by the Big Blue Rat cell line technique. So far, nucleotide transition becomes dominant as compared to the control without rX transduction. Thus, ROS generation by X association with mitochondria plays an important role in the cell transformation by HBV, representing paradigm shift of viral hepatocacinogenesis.",

Survivin-HBXIP complexes associate with pro-caspase 9 and prevent its recruitment to Apaf1, and thereby selectively suppressing apoptosis initiated via the mitochondria pathway. Notably viral HBX protein interacts with HBXIP/Survivin complexes and increased their pro-caspase 9 binding.
