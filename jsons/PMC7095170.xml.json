            "text": "Recently, an increasing number of experimental studies have emphasized the potential for mechanical ventilation (MV) to cause lung damage, termed ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [1]. Pre-existing tissue injury is thought to work together with MV to cause lung damage [2]. Both lung over-distension and the cyclic closing and opening of lung terminal units appear to play a role in the development of VILI. Ample experimental data have now shown that ventilation strategies combining low tidal volume (VT) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to keep the lung open without over-distending it were \u2018lung-protective\u2019. These experimental findings have recently been translated into clinical practice where the use of such strategies has been shown to decrease the systemic consequences of injurious ventilation as well as mortality in ventilated critically ill patients. [3, 4]. However, selecting the right level of PEEP in such patients remains controversial [5, 6].",

Increased mortality and length of stay are generally associated with the occurrence of VAP [7, 8]. Therefore, among experimental studies which aim at evaluating the influence of the ventilation strategy on lung injury, those in which the lung insult is a bacterial challenge are of particular interest. Several authors have reported that an injurious ventilatory strategy combining a large tidal volume with a modest level of PEEP worsened lung injury, increased the lung bacterial burden and enhanced the systemic spread of infection [9\u201313]. However, the beneficial effect of adding PEEP during experimental pneumonia was sought only in animals submitted to high VT. Conflicting results regarding the effect of PEEP have been reported in non-infectious lung injury animal models [14\u201317].",

In the present study, we found that the rabbits submitted to MV exhibited significantly greater lung bacterial concentrations as well as more injury when compared to the spontaneously breathing ones.

However, in these studies, the animals were subjected to lung over-distension since VT and/or PIP was high. Therefore, the addition of PEEP may have been protective by lessening the lung damage caused by a deleterious ventilatory regimen, as previously demonstrated [27\u201329].

Although the lung bacterial burden was not influenced by the PEEP settings, as previously found, a low level of PEEP was associated with reduced systemic translocation when compared to ZEEP [26]. Although our results do not allow us to draw clear conclusions regarding this point, our histological data provide some interesting clues. We observed that adding 5 cmH2O PEEP was associated with a trend toward a reduction in lung injury in animals with pneumonia ventilated with a low tidal volume. Such findings could illustrate how PEEP reduces pulmonary-to-systemic bacteria translocation by preventing VILI in infected lung areas, as suggested elsewhere [26, 30]. Although speculative, other mechanisms could be considered. Thus, PEEP has been shown to reduce lung edema, to allow surfactant preservation and to redirect the blood flow into poorly aerated alveoli (e.g., infected lung areas) [1]. In addition, PEEP could have reduced the spleen perfusion. However, since we used a pressure-controlled ventilator, the three groups were not submitted to the same VTs and this may account for the differences observed in terms of lung injury. Therefore, the VT reduction subsequent to the addition of 5 cmH2O of PEEP could account, at least in part, for its benefit.",

Concurrently, lung injury including pneumonia severity and emphysema-like lesions in non-pneumonic regions tended to be greater in the hPEEP than in the lPEEP group, possibly reflecting the extent to which the well-aerated lung regions were inflated, whereas poorly aerated alveoli could not be recruited because of the pneumonic lung stiffness. Our findings would be in accordance with the results of studies that attempted to assess lung aeration distribution in humans with ARDS. Indeed, some authors have shown that when lung injury was primary, i.e. aspiration or bacterial pneumonia, the addition of high PEEP could be deleterious since its application resulted in overinflation of the normally aerated lungs rather than in recruitment of the remaining poorly aerated lung [6, 31, 32].",

For example, small animals seem to be more prone to VILI and bacteria translocation from the lung than larger animals [1]. Second, the fact that the randomization to the different PEEP levels occurred before bacterial instillation could be questioned and may account for the different rates of pulmonary-to-systemic translocation, due to variable bacteria distribution. We tried to minimize this putative effect by performing a similar recruitment maneuver following the bacterial inoculation in animals from all PEEP groups. In addition, no significant difference was found between these groups in terms of lobar bacterial concentrations (data not shown). Third, since invasive monitoring was not used, one cannot rule out hemodynamic modifications that may have played a role in the systemic spread of the infection and in the ventilator-induced diffuse alveolar damage. Fourth, VT may have changed during the 24-h period of ventilation, due to changes in the lung mechanical properties in relation to the development of pneumonia. Therefore, the direct effect of PEEP on the pneumonia features cannot be ascertained. Fifth, since neither PaCO2 nor arterial blood pH was monitored, an effect of hypercapnic acidosis on lung injury cannot be excluded. However, greater PaCO2 values should be expected in the hPEEP group when compared to the lPEEP group, assuming that VT was lower in the former, that could in turn be lung protective [34].",

However, the end-expiratory volume, if excessive, could be an important determinant of the degree of lung injury, as previously described in non-infected animals, which could, in turn, influence the systemic spreading of the infectious process [37]. These results should be taken as a word of caution by the clinician when setting the PEEP level in patients with pneumonia who require MV. It would be of interest to investigate in further in vivo or in vitro studies whether over-distension per se may impair local lung and/or systemic immune defense against bacterial infection.",
