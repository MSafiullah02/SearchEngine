Epidemiological studies have played a central part in understanding the association of RV and other respiratory viruses in exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases. This chapter offers a summary of the epidemiological literature that has linked RV infection with acute exacerbations, and Table 6.1\nrefers to the key references establishing the importance of RV infection in exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases. Through a range of postulated mechanisms, RV infection elicits a complex host response that in part, may actually contribute to disease pathology and perpetuate symptoms rather than prevent virus infection and the associated symptoms. Whether or not RV infection directly triggers these events that add to, synergize with, or change the nature of the host response that drive disease, or whether the underlying disease makes certain individuals susceptible to RV infection is a pertinent question in the field. This chapter includes an in-depth commentary on the reasons why RV is the most common viral pathogen associated with exacerbations of these diseases; including the impact of current and emerging treatments on the outcome of RV infections and disease progression. Finally we explore the potential for new therapeutic opportunities to better manage chronic respiratory diseases whilst minimizing the acute and chronic disease promoting effects of RV infections.\n",

            "text": "Asthma is a chronic disease of the conducting airways characterized by airway hyperreactivity that causes reversible airway smooth muscle (ASM) mediated bronchoconstriction. Another defining feature of asthma is airway inflammation that perpetuates airway hyperreactivity as well as mucus production, which together with airway inflammation cause airway narrowing, airway obstruction, and resistance to airflow and symptoms.10 Asthma has been linked to numerous stimuli including airway infections, various allergens, exposure to airborne pollutants, exercise, stress, and nervous provocation.10 The key feature of asthma is decreased lung function, measured as spontaneous changes in peak expiratory flow (PEF) or a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second following provocation. Symptoms include nocturnal awakenings, dyspnea, wheeze, and tightening of the chest. The immediate effects of asthma are generally reversible by a short-acting \u03b22-agonist. Asthma is now considered a heterogeneous, complex disease and can present as a chronic, stable disease of different severity, including mild, moderate, or severe. Responses to treatments, such as glucocorticosteroids (GCs) and bronchodilators, may also vary, and be categorized as well, partial, or poorly controlled. The most common endophenotype is Th2/type 2 associated or allergic asthma, which is defined by a physician\u2019s diagnosis of asthma often associated with high serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, positive skin prick tests to aeroallergens, and/or confirmed diagnosis of an atopic disorder such as allergic rhinitis. Evidence of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-4, or IL-13 driven inflammation, or increased levels of eosinophils in blood or lower airway samples, or high levels of FeNO may also confirm Th2 or type-2 associated asthma. Other asthma endophenotypes may exist, including adult-onset asthma; steroid resistant, poorly steroid responsive, or neutrophilic asthma; fixed airflow limitation asthma; or more simply termed type 2 low asthma. However, these are not as well defined by genetic analysis or biomarkers as allergic asthma.11., 12. Currently, the exact nature or existence of these subgroups is vigorously debated.13., 14. Erroneous diagnosis, effects of treatments, and other confounders have led to a lack of consensus. The identification of correct asthma endophenotypes and implementation of precise medicine approaches represents an important ongoing challenge to the field.",

In the United States, there are approximately 1.6 M emergency room visits associated with asthma each year,15., 16. and approximately 5% of asthmatic individuals have at least one AE per year.17 AE may have multiple predictors; however recent AE history is the strongest predictor for a future AE event. In children, the number of allergic sensitization triggers and race are other important predictors.18 AE are more common in individuals with poor lung function, or who are classified as having severe or difficult to treat asthma, which may comprise up to 15% of all asthmatics.18., 19. AE may be life threatening, and results in significant morbidity worldwide including school/study absenteeism and sick leave. Recent economic studies have shown that individuals suffering from AE have increased both total healthcare and asthma specific healthcare costs, when compared with individuals who do not experience AE.20 In unadjusted total costs, individuals that experience AE may accrue costs of >$9000 USD per year, compared with approximately $5000 USD per year for individuals who do not.\n",

RV are identified in community treated mild exacerbations,5 in hospitalized patients,67., 68. and in very severe exacerbations requiring intensive care.62 Virus infection rates during acute exacerbations are unlikely to represent chronic infection or seasonal carriage, as viral PCRs are rarely positive when patients are sampled prior to49., 61., 69. or after an exacerbation,5., 6., 60. or in time-matched controls.51., 54., 56., 59. Whilst these studies support a causal relationship, they cannot exclude secondary causation (e.g., bacterial coinfection or air pollution). The novel experimental infection studies using RV in COPD subjects shows clear increases in lower respiratory tract symptoms following inoculation, along with airflow obstruction, and systemic and airway inflammation mimicking a COPD-E observed during naturally occurring infection. Indeed, in experimental infection studies, in over 90% of RV infected COPD subjects, COPD exacerbation criteria were met, suggesting that the virus detection frequencies reported in naturally occurring exacerbations (22%\u201364%) are actually a gross underestimate of the true frequency of viruses as precipitants of exacerbations. In the experimental infection model, RV RNA was present in the upper respiratory tract prior to progressing to the lower airway and causing COPD exacerbation onset, thereby excluding secondary causation.64., 65., 70. Moreover these studies demonstrated a temporal relationship between viral replication in the airways, symptoms, and exacerbation onset, and viral clearance and exacerbation resolution. The virus load also correlated with markers of inflammation, and oxidative and nitrosative stress in the airways.64., 70. Therefore these studies have provided compelling evidence to the field that RV infection is directly linked to COPD-E.",

The predominant cause of infectious complications in CF is considered bacterial infection, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa the most common organism cultured. The role of a dysfunctional CTFR protein plays a key role in deficient innate immunity to P. aeruginosa infection due to resultant increased innate inflammation owing to disruptions in lipid metabolism, enhanced interactions of P. aeruginosa with epithelial cells, or a direct role for the CFTR in bacterial clearance subsequent to CFTR-mediated epithelial cell ingestion.74 There is relatively little published work on the role of RV infections in CF exacerbations (CF-E), but recent studies suggest that viral infections have a significant impact. Thus the role of respiratory viruses is likely to have been significantly underestimated in the past. For example, prior to the utilization of modern PCR techniques, studies relying on serology, culture, and immunofluorescence implicated a viral cause in 10%\u201328% of exacerbations in CF patients.75., 76., 77., 78. However, PCR studies have increased this detection rate to 46% of exacerbating patients, compared with only 18% of patients in stable condition.79 RV has been specifically identified in 13%\u201358% of CF patients with acute respiratory illness and was associated with worse respiratory symptoms, airway function deterioration, and greater incidence of secondary bacterial infection, compared with matched uninfected patients.8., 77., 79., 80. A number of different viral species have been detected in CF patients, with the most common being RVs, influenza viruses, and RSVs. Interestingly, the rates of viral infections in children with CF is not elevated in comparison to healthy children but importantly the severity of clinical illness associated with infection is demonstrably greater.81 As is the case in other airways diseases, viral infections are associated with decline in lung function and more severe clinical illness in CF, indicating that they contribute to disease progression demonstrating the need for further research in this field.",

Certainly the \u201ccommonness\u201d and ease of transmission of the common cold virus; the fact there are any number of 160+ antigenically distinct viruses circulating at any one time is important. Furthermore, other factors that contribute to the predominance of RV in exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases can be broadly described as follows: the ability of RV to (1) induce inflammation, nervous provocation, airway remodeling or repair processes, and airway mucus production; (2) synergize or add to ongoing, established inflammation (e.g., allergic or type-2 mediated immune pathways in asthma); (3) promote or contribute to secondary bacterial infections by degrading antimicrobial defenses (epithelial junctional proteins and airway barrier integrity and antimicrobial peptides); and (4) expose impaired or aberrant host antiviral innate immunity that is either intrinsic or caused by treatment regimes. It is likely that RV meets one or more of these criteria in a manner that makes it qualitatively different from other respiratory viruses. In the case of asthma, RV, or certain subtypes of RV, have been referred to as \u201casthmagenic viruses\u201d95 due to their ability to be associated with AE more readily than other respiratory viruses. In one recent study, RV was described as exacerbating existing asthma, while the effects of influenza infection, which in terms of symptoms were quite different and more systemic, were described as asthma-augmented influenza infection,96 supporting the idea that the nature of RV infection may be distinct from other respiratory viruses. In this section, the characteristics of RV infection that may explain its predominance in exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases will be given due attention. Table 6.3\noffers a summary.",

A key feature of RV and other respiratory viruses in promoting exacerbations is their ability to induce either lung inflammation, nervous provocation, or in the case of asthma and IPF, lung injury, repair, or remodeling. Many of the innate receptors that recognize RV, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I like helicases, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, activate the NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors, which induce over 100 proinflammatory and host response genes.97 RV, RSV, and influenza induce a range of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules and mucins,98 thus contributing to lung inflammation.The ability to promote lung inflammation is important in diseases where lung inflammation is key, and includes asthma, CF, and COPD. Mucins cause mucous plugging of the airway while cytokines facilitate cellular chemotaxis, activation, and proliferation of immune cells in the infected airway.36., 99., 100. RV can increase airway hyperresponsiveness by increasing 5-lipoxygenase and the cyclooxygenase pathway enzyme COX-2.101 While not as well characterized as asthma, inflammation is relevant in COPD, with a surprisingly low number of in vitro studies comparing the responses of cells from COPD patients to viral infection with those from healthy controls.64., 102., 103. Similarly the few available studies examining naturally occurring virus-induced COPD exacerbations have demonstrated a role for inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils6 and proinflammatory mediators such as CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL-10/IP-10, and CCL-5/RANTES.55., 69., 104. Experimental RV infection studies in COPD have indicated that RV induces airway neutrophilic inflammation and innate inflammatory meditators such as IL-1\u03b2, GM-CSF, CXCL8/IL-8, and TNF.64., 70., 105. These, and other in vitro studies,102 indicate an enhanced inflammatory response to virus infection in COPD subjects and this may be one mechanism whereby viruses induce exacerbations. The role of neutrophils is incompletely understood. While having the ability to damage tissues and contribute to airway inflammation, they undoubtedly have important roles in antibacterial defense, may produce type I IFNs,106 and in mouse models, may have antiviral properties.107 Of interest, a recent Phase 2a clinical trial of AZD5069, an inhibitor of the neutrophil chemokine receptor CXCR2, failed to affect severe AE rate, lung function of asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score.108 The mechanisms of viral-induced CF-E and increased clinical illness are not well characterized with inconsistent results from published studies. Whilst some groups have demonstrated increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by airway epithelial cells obtained from CF patients compared with healthy controls,81., 109. others have failed to detect any differences.110., 111. It is unclear what leads to these contrasting observations.RV infection has been shown to damage and compromise the integrity of the airway; through infecting airway epithelial cells and directly causing cell death112 and/or epithelial cell shedding.113., 114. They can also affect epithelial permeability leading to increased airway inflammation and creating opportunities for increased secondary infections,115 allergen uptake,116 or exposure to environmental pollutants or irritants; all of which may trigger exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases. In terms of nervous provocation, RV has recently been shown to upregulate the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family members TRPA1 and TRPV1 in neuroblastoma cells117 and may be important in the cough response65 and sensitivity to methacholine118 observed during infection.RV can also induce mediators required for airway repair, which results in airway scarring or remodeling. These processes include angiogenesis, increased ASM proliferation and hypertrophy, and thicker basement membranes owing to collagen and fibronectin deposition as well as the generation of new lymphatic vessels that ultimately result in thicker airway walls and reduced lung function; the importance of these process is obvious in asthma. Whether or not RV infection directly initiates this process is unclear; however, RV can induce some of these proangiogenic mediators including fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor,119., 120., 121. required for fibrosis in IPF, and the structural proteins perlecan and collagen122 the building blocks of airway remodeling.2.\nViruses synergize or add to ongoing, established inflammation. Evidence for this property is greatest for RV infections in asthma, where a synergy between viral infections and allergen sensitization and exposure was first realized through epidemiological studies123., 124. and additional evidence for this interaction has been gained in both human challenge36., 37. and mouse models of RV.39., 40., 125., 126., 127. In individuals with asthma, RV infection of the bronchial epithelium also likely has additive and synergistic effects on allergen sensitization and challenge as the epithelial derived pro-Th2 factors IL-33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which activate Th2 cells, DCs, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells, are induced readily by RV infection.37., 126., 128. This now allows a direct link to how respiratory virus infection of the airway epithelium can augment existing Th2 pathways in asthma. Whether or not increased RV disease burden in asthma is simply a result of a type 2 skewed environment or whether RV contributes to type 2 inflammation is a wider debate that is often discussed in asthma onset.23., 129. Concerning AE, RV is perhaps most easily understood as a direct contributor to established type 2 inflammation as discussed above, the results of which tip the fine balance between stable asthma and increased symptoms leading to AE. A study of cohabiting asthma and nonasthmatic pairs in the 1990s found that while the frequency of RV infection was not different between asthmatics and healthy volunteers, asthmatics had a more severe and longer duration of lower airway symptoms,2 consistent with the concept that individuals with asthma may not be prone to greater number of RV infections, but deal with the infection in a fundamentally different manner from nonasthmatic individuals. Further studies using RV experimental challenge generally show that asthmatics and nonasthmatics have equal rates of successful infection,36., 37. while asthmatics generate greater lower airway symptom scores, which increase with decreased asthma control.130 How underlying type 2 immunity and allergic inflammation may influence the course of RV infection is another matter, and will be discussed in detail below.3.\nTo promote or contribute to secondary bacterial infections by degrading antimicrobial defenses. The ability to promote secondary bacterial infection is most relevant for AE, or wheeze in children, COPD-E, and CF-E. As RV can disrupt the integrity of the airway epithelium, and reduce antibacterial cytokine responses131 and degrade antimicrobial peptides,132 this may promote secondary bacterial infection including enhanced dispersal,115 further infiltration and colonization of bacterial species that may already be present at low level. In AE in children, RV can increase Moraxella abundance.133., 134. In CF, exacerbations associated with a respiratory viral infection are associated with increased bacterial load,135 although not all studies report this association.136\nViral and bacterial infections are common in COPD-E but when the role of dual virus\u2013bacterial was previously considered studies appeared to indicate that it does not play a prominent role in COPD-E with low detection rates ranging from 6.5%62 up to only 27%.6., 63., 67. However, Papi et al. did observe that exacerbations with dual infection are more severe.6 Then, in a study of experimental RV infection, secondary bacterial infections were detected in 60% of COPD patients with confirmed RV infection,132 and increases in proteobacterial DNA sequences, including the potentially pathogenic Haemophilus influenzae have been reported.66 Crucially viruses and bacteria were detected at separate time points with a pattern of virus infection occurring first and bacterial infection later. The implications were that studies of naturally occurring exacerbations that collect samples at a single time point are underestimating the true incidence of dual infection, and are likely missing secondary infections. This was confirmed in a more recent study of naturally occurring exacerbations in which patients were sampled at two time points during an exacerbation. When RV was initially detected but bacteria were absent, 73% had a bacteria detected when sampled again at day 14.49\nThere is also evidence that dual virus\u2013bacterial infection contributes to COPD-E severity. In those COPD patients with H. influenzae detected at exacerbation, the presence of a symptomatic cold was associated with higher bacterial loads,137 and in hospitalized patients with COPD-E, dual virus\u2013bacterial infection correlated with impaired lung function and longer hospital stay.6 During experimental RV infection, coinfection was associated with prolonged lower respiratory symptoms.132 In summary, the role of dual virus\u2013bacterial infections in COPD exacerbations is likely to have been overlooked and may be an important factor contributing to the severity of COPD exacerbations.4.\nTo expose impaired or aberrant host antiviral innate immunity that is either intrinsic or caused by treatment regimes. One example is that the above chronic respiratory diseases are associated in some way with impaired antiviral immunity. A striking example is the effects of type 2 mediated allergic inflammation in allergic asthma on the antiviral Interferon (IFN) response. Deficient type I and type III IFNs have been associated with upregulated type 2 pathways138 that involve the presence of IgE,139., 140. skin prick test (SPTs),141 or eosinophilic inflammation,142 and it is believed this may be the root cause of impaired antiviral immunity, potentially resulting in higher virus loads,37 and ultimately increased symptoms and worse lung function.\n",

The fact that this could alter immune responses to viral infections and thus predispose to AE rates seems plausible. In mice, long-term treatment with antibiotics negatively impacts on immunity to influenza.164\n",

In children who wheezed, the risk of AE and admissions to hospital were also significantly increased in the 2 years after the first antibiotic prescription. Children who received antibiotics in infancy had significantly lower induction of cytokines from virus-infected PBMCs at age 11.165 The conclusion was that an increased susceptibility to viral infections is associated with both early life antibiotic prescription and asthma risk, although the authors could not exclude reverse causation, in that antibiotic use or asthma influence PBMC responses to viruses later in life. Clearly this is an area of emerging interest and further large clinical studies are required to understand the interrelationships between RV and asthma and COPD treatments, and to determine whether certain treatments do benefit respiratory infections in asthma.",

In a subgroup analysis, asthmatics with more severe disease did experience improvements in ACQ and morning PEF compared with placebo, suggesting that a pan antiviral may be useful in treating AE in more severe patients. A confounding factor for IFN-\u03b2 therapy acting as an antiviral is the fact that IFN-\u03b2 may provide additional therapeutic benefit by downregulating type 2 pathways.150 This makes IFN therapy attractive as a therapy for AE, but complicates the interpretation of any positive effects; the fact that asthmatics may be defective in IFN induction139., 142., 174., 175. further makes IFN-therapy attractive, but may additionally complicate the interpretation of trials with IFNs. Additionally, IFN-inducing agents such as TLR9 agonists176 may also hold promise for AE by downregulating type 2 immunity via inducing IFNs. The converse may also be true of anti-Th2 cytokine therapy, which does show impressive reductions in AE rate12., 177., 178.; however it is unclear if they act by reducing ongoing type 2 inflammation alone, or by restoring a defective IFN-mediated antiviral response. Anti-IgE has been shown to affect AE rates in asthmatic children,140., 179. and a recent study of 300 volunteers showed that AE rate during anti-IgE therapy was directly related to ex vivo levels of IFN-\u03b1 produced from RV infected PBMCs.140 These mechanisms may also be relevant in COPD, as COPD patients may exhibit increased eosinophil infiltration during COPD-E.6., 7. Clearly, further careful research is needed in this area, and the use of anti-Th2 biologics and anti-IgE in established experimental RV challenge studies may also help discern their true mechanism of action and how asthmatics are benefiting.",

The past 20 years have undoubtedly put respiratory viral infections center stage as triggers for exacerbations, and their perceived importance will only increase as diagnostic tests improve. Many challenges still remain in elucidating mechanisms of disease immunopathology, identifying at-risk populations, optimizing treatment, and identifying future therapeutic targets. For basic research, an important directive will be to continue to translate findings from in vitro or ex vivo culture systems and animal models, into human models. The different respiratory diseases are also at different stages in terms of addressing unmet therapeutic needs; a subpopulation of asthmatics experiencing AE will benefit from additional anti-type 2 cytokine therapy, while a better understanding of basic disease mechanisms is needed for other subgroups. These new disease modifying approaches are yet to be applied to COPD-E, and there are reasons for cautious optimism that COPD-E may benefit from approaches successfully applied to asthma. CF and the ILDs represent different challenges, more basic research is required to better understand the role of viruses, underlying mechanisms of disease and other triggers of exacerbations; these two diseases may also be candidate diseases for direct antiviral therapy.",
