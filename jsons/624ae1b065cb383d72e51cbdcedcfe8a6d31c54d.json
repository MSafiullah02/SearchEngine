Within four months of the first reported cases, more than two and a half million cases were confirmed with over two hundred thousand deaths globally, and many countries had taken extreme measures to stop the spread. In this work, we analyse the response to the COVID-19 outbreak for 103 countries over the period 22 January to 13 April 2020. We utilise a novel stochastic epidemiological model that includes a regulatory mechanism that captures the level of tolerance to rising confirmed cases within the response behaviour. Using approximate Bayesian computation, we identify that the top ten outbreaks as of 31 March are characterised by a high tolerance to rising cases tallies, whereas countries that avoided severe outbreak have a low tolerance. Countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher identification rate. As of 13 April, almost all countries show declines in transmission rates and basic reproductive numbers. Furthermore, countries approaching recovery also increased their identification rate between 31 March and 13 April. We also demonstrate that uncertainty in undocumented infections dramatically impacts uncertainty in predictions. Overall, we recommend that broader testing is required to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections.",

These are examples of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies that many countries have introduced to slow transmission rates and relieve pressure on healthcare systems in the absence of a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 [?,14] . Modelling and simulation are at the forefront of determining the efficacy of these measures in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and quantifying risk of future outbreaks along with their potential severity [2, 8, 16, 31] . Understanding of these effects is crucial given the potential deleterious sociological and economic impacts of many NPIs [3] [4] [5] 9] .",

There is a large body of literature related to modelling specific intervention strategies [16] . We take a unique approach that does not explicitly model specific interventions. Instead, our model captures a general tendency for the transmission rate to decline as the number of confirmed cases increases. Through the inclusion of a utility function, the model also allows for more general responses incorporating deaths and recoveries to reflect alternative imperatives for intervention. With this model we can identify key features differentiating countries that have experienced a severe outbreak from those that have managed to contain the spread.",

Our characterisation is a broad assessment of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and reflects how countries in early phases of outbreak may have adjusted their strategies to reduce the time to recovery. In particular, we find that very severe outbreaks are characterised by a high tolerance to rising confirmed case numbers before significant reductions in transmission rates occur. Of the top ten severely affected countries (in terms of cumulative cases), the only countries that observed a decrease in active cases during the period of study (China and South Korea) are characterised by high identification rates; the result of highly effective identification and quarantine programs. We also find that, for many countries, the trans-mission rates in the later period of the study are declining. However, large unobserved infected population counts are also estimated. Our analysis shows that increased testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine measures are effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19 outbreaks world-wide. We also demonstrate that the unknown magnitude of undocumented cases substantively impacts uncertainty in predictions and we conclude that wider testing is also essential to reduce this uncertainty.",

The cumulative confirmed cases can be recovered from the model as C t = A t + R t + D t . Importantly, the true values of S t , I t , and R u t are not observable in reality and are latent variables in our model. This explicit treatment of an undocumented infected population is essential for more realistic uncertainty quantification. A novel feature of our model is the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 that depends on a utility function of the observable states, A t , R t , and D t . For the presented results, this rate is a monotonically decreasing function in the cumulative confirmed cases C t , representing the overall population response to rising confirmed case numbers. This effectively approximates the combined effect of NPI introduction, community compliance with various interventions, and a general change in social behaviour as media outlets report higher case and fatality statistics. However, it is important to note that our framework allows for other utility functions that lead to other functional forms for the transmission rate (See Materials and Methods, and Supplementary Material).",

While details are provided in the Materials and Methods section, the parameters n and \u03ba deserve some interpretation here. The regulation parameter n controls the rate at which the transmission rate \u03b1 is scaled down as the cumulative cases increase. In general, n \u2265 1 represents a response with a low tolerance to increasing cases, 0 < n < 1 is a response with a higher tolerance for larger case numbers, and n = 0 indicates no regulatory effect at all (See Material and Methods for more details). Throughout, we refer to n \u2265 1 as a low tolerance response, and n < 1 as a high tolerance response. Importantly, n does not provide information on the timescale in which the community responds, nor the overall efficacy of interventions and management. Rather, n is an indicator of how tolerant a community has been to growing case numbers. The parameter \u03ba estimates the number of undocumented infections relative to confirmed cases on the first day that exceeds 100 confirmed cases (t = 0), that is, \u03ba = I 0 /C 0 . Higher values for \u03ba imply greater levels of undocumented spread ahead of the earliest reported cases, and smaller values of \u03ba represents effective identification, quarantine and early contact tracing.",

S1 and S2 in Supplementary material) are similar across countries. This is expected as these parameters mainly describe the SARS-CoV-2 infection itself, rather than differing national responses. For the period up to 31 March, exceptions include: a higher uncertainty in death rate for Honduras, higher uncertainty in recovery rate for Nigeria and Venezuela, and increased uncertainty in the \u03b1 0 parameter of Afghanistan, Cameroon, Cuba, Honduras, Cambodia, Mauritius, Nigeria, Palestine, and Venezuela. The data also appear to be uninformative for the relative recovery rate, \u03b7 since the posterior is very close to the prior (Fig. S3 ). The posterior marginals for the identification rate, \u03b3, the regulatory parameter, n, and the initial infected scale parameter \u03ba, relate to the nature of the initial outbreak and subsequent response. As a result, there is significant variation in these distributions across countries (Figs. S3 and S4). To investigate global patterns, we compute, for each country, the marginal posterior means for the parameters \u03b3, n, and \u03ba.

However, it is important to restate that a high tolerance response n < 1 is not equivalent to a slow response in time. In ascending order, the five smallest values for [6, 23] . It is unexpected that the value of n for China is low, since strong lockdown measures were taken in Hubei [23] ; we expect this is due to the absence of clinically diagnosed cases reported before to 13 February [43] . It is also important to note that small n does not mean that NPIs were not effective, but rather that they became effective at higher tallies of confirmed cases. France, Iran, Turkey, and the United States also have comparable values for \u03b3, but did not experience a decline in active cases in the time frame of the study. These countries have a larger value for \u03ba, indicating a large number of latent infections at an earlier stage of the outbreak, therefore a delay in the effect is expected. With \u03ba = 1.586 (95% CI: [1.567, 1.606]), Iran is a particularly extreme example of this, as there was significant undetected spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the volumes of pilgrims passing through the city of Qom [15] . Of the severely affected countries, the United Kingdom has the closest signature to Taiwan and Singapore, albeit with a higher \u03ba and lower n. The larger \u03ba likely implies early unobserved transmission prior to abandonment of \"herd immunity\" targets in favour of social distancing, and closing of non-essential business and schools [16, 27] . Australia has a very similar characterisation to the United Kingdom, with higher \u03ba, but also higher n that likely reflects the introduction of travel bans and social gathering restrictions introduced in the second half of March.",

Unfortunately, most countries also have large values of \u03ba, indicating that delays in early detection have lead to a larger unobserved infectious population.

The distribution of these point estimates is shown in Fig. 3 (A)-(C) with the same countries highlighted as in Fig. 2 . For the top eight countries still experiencing severe outbreaks on 31 March, there is a significant shift in these parameter estimates using data for the period 22 January-13 April. There is also a reduction in the uncertainty for some parameters overall (See Supplementary Material Fig. S5-S8 ). These shifts, demonstrated in Fig. 3 (D)-(F), have some broad trends. In Fig. 3(D) and (F), all eight countries show a decrease in the parameter n, with France, Iran, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States having the most substantial declines. This indicates that, in light of more recent data, the community response to the outbreak had a higher tolerance to growing case numbers than earlier data indicated. Fig. 3(D) and (E) indicate that most of these countries have a lower identification rate. However, it is promising to see a small increase in \u03b3 for Germany and Switzerland, and a large increase in \u03b3 for Italy and Spain; this is possibly a reflection of increased testing capabilities within these countries between 31 March to 13 April (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus; Accessed 14 April). Overall, there is also a decrease in \u03ba, indicating that the number of early undocumented cases could be lower than previously thought. One concerning exception is Italy, with an increase in the point estimate with \u03ba = 0.956 (95% CI: [0.924, 0.988]). Australia also shows a decrease in the value of n = 0.703 (95% CI: [0.693, 0.713]), but also a decrease in \u03ba = 0.259 (95% CI: [0.240, 0.278]).

Comparing Fig 2(A) -(C) with Fig 3(A) -(C) highlights the dynamical nature on the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "text": "As stated above, the regulatory parameter n does not provide insight into the full management of the outbreak. It simply provides a measure of how the transmission rate declines as a function of confirmed case counts (see Materials and Methods). We compute several derived quantities that provide a more complete view of how countries are managing the pandemic. Specifically, we consider the following quantities: the case death rate relative to the case recovery rate, \u03b4/\u03b2; the case removal rate relative to identification rate, (\u03b2 + \u03b4)/\u03b3; the relative strength of transmission rate regulation, (f (C 0 ) \u2212 f (C T ))/f (C 0 ), where f (\u00b7) is the transmission rate regulatory function (see Materials and Methods), and respectively C 0 , and C T , are the number of confirmed cases at the start of the outbreak (first day exceeding 100 confirmed cases) and at the end of the data period (13 April); and the relative reduction in the basic reproduction number [10] , (R 0 \u2212 R e )/R 0 , where R 0 is the basic reproductive number at the start of the outbreak and R e is the basic reproduction number at the end of the data period (See Supplementary Material). Point estimates of these ratios are computed through expectations with respect to the full joint parameter posterior distributions (See Materials and Methods, and Supplementary Material) for each country. Fig. 4(A) shows the distribution of point estimates related to management and treatment of confirmed cases. The effective management of COVID-19 cases within Germany can be inferred by a low value for the relative case fatality rate \u03b4/\u03b2 = 0.083 (95% CI [0.070,0.086]) and high value for the case removal rate relative to identification rate (\u03b2 + \u03b4)/\u03b3 = 1.12 (95% CI [0.76,1.48]). The United Kingdom is an outlier with a very high \u03b4/\u03b2 = 41.32 (95% CI:[2.64, 80.01]); we expect this is due to a discrepancy in the data for recoveries in the United Kingdom (with only 626 recoveries recorded). China is another outlier with (\u03b2 + \u03b4)/\u03b3 = 6.66 (95% CI: [0, 13.73]) due to relatively poor model fit for China as discussed above. Fig. 4(B) shows that globally there is a high level of regulation with (f (C 0 ) \u2212 f (C T ))/f (C 0 ) > 0.7 (that is, regulatory strength greater than 70% of maximum) for nearly all countries. Despite this, there are many countries with only moderate reductions in the basic reproductive number, indicating that more testing is required or a higher level of residual transmission \u03b1 0 . In particular, the second outbreak occurring within Singapore in the later period of study is identified by a high level regulation but very little decrease in the basic reproductive number. Fortunately, the basic reproduction number reduced by at least 50% for all of the most severely affected countries.",

However, our approach also enables predictions that account for uncertainty in the undocumented infected population and in the community tolerance of rising cases. There are many unknowns within the current pandemic that affect the accuracy of model prediction [20, 28] . In particular, we have no estimates for the number of undocumented cases world wide. Furthermore, inadequate uncertainty quantification can lead to unrealistic credible prediction intervals [28] . We use our Bayesian framework to handle both uncertainty in model parameters and uncertainty in undocumented infected population. Regarding prediction uncertainty, we take a conservative approach that provides predictions accounting for uncertainty in the evolution up to the current time. We perform this by sampling from the posterior predictive distribution and continue model evolution to the prediction horizon. In this way, we consider uncertainty in all possible histories (parameter values and latent population evolution) to quantify uncertainty in predictions conditional on the model formulation.",

For prediction, each stochastic simulation is continued in time up to the prediction horizon. Parameter point estimates are obtained using the marginal posterior means and uncertainty is quantified using the marginal posterior variance.
