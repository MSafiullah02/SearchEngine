            "text": "Chloride homeostasis has a pivotal role in controlling neuronal excitability in the adult brain as well as during neurodevelopment. The intracellular concentration of chloride is regulated by the dynamic equilibrium between passive fluxes resulting from the operations of both plasma membrane chloride channels and local impermeant anions as well as the active fluxes mediated by transporters. Chloride channels are involved in several physiological functions such as cell volume regulation, transmembrane fluid transport, muscular activity, and neuroexcitability (for review see Duran et al.1). Their dysfunction is observed in more than a dozen human pathological conditions, including several that affect the nervous system, such as epilepsy and certain psychiatric diseases (for review see Bowery and Smart2). The development of drugs targeted to these chloride ion channels represents an important field for developing novel pharmaceutical agents and the need for anxiolytics and hypnotics with fewer side effects than the benzodiazepines (for review Kowalczyk and Kulig3). Specifically, a complete understanding of the physiological GABAergic activity requires a full quantification of the dynamic properties of GABA-activated chloride channels.",

However, despite the advantage of a wide range of fluorophores allowing for the measurement of multiple targets and high-throughput capabilities,6 the technique suffers from several methodological drawbacks, including low sensitivity and specificity, limitations inherent to the loading and washing steps of the protocol, pH sensitivity of the dye, and photobleaching and phototoxicity. In addition, the quantitative determination of intracellular chloride concentration changes with nonelectrophysiological methods amenable to screening approaches has been challenging, in particular because the transmembrane ratio of chloride is low (10:1) and the equilibrium potential of chloride is generally close to the resting membrane potential of cells. These two factors result in minute chloride concentration changes, therefore raising issues of sensitivity.5 Time-lapse experiments using living cells with fluorescent dyes are challenging to implement routinely and imply high running cost due to the price of fluorescent dyes. Furthermore, the image focusing process required prior to image acquisition itself is time-consuming.7 These disadvantages consequently yield a reduced throughput and a cost per data point that may represent an issue for some screening settings.",

For example, the commercial instruments Epic BT (Corning) and BIND (SRU Biosystems) make use of resonance waveguide gratings to generate an evanescent wave to sense whole-cell responses.10 Other instruments, for example, ECIS (Applied BioPhysics), xCELLigence (Acea Biosciences), and CellKey (Molecular Devices), rely on a low electrolyte impedance interface to detect the impedance of a cell layer under sinusoidal-voltage-generated electric fields.11 All in all, these label-free technologies are still currently not optimal for their application in image-based screening assays, due to their lack of satisfactory spatial resolution for studies at the single-cell level and their high associated consumable costs.12",

From these accurate OPD measurements, various biophysical parameters have been derived, including absolute cell volume, dry mass, and protein concentration.15 Furthermore, QP-DHM represents an efficient tool to perform both early detection of cell death12,16 and monitoring of ligand-gated ion channel activity. The osmotic-driven water flux accompanying ionic movements related to the channel activity can indeed be monitored by DHM, as it significantly changes the intracellular refractive index (see eq 1).15,17,18",

However, to adapt the technique to high-throughput screening or high-content screening, modifications must be conducted to accommodate imaging using microtiter plates. With our current system, culture medium is replaced by the assay medium containing GABA and/or other compounds using a robotic liquid handling dispenser. When four images are acquired by well, the whole 96-well plate can be imaged in less than 4 min. Time-lapse acquisition of serial dilution of GABA (Fig. 2) allowed us to optimize the timing for image acquisition (between 8 and 12 min after medium replacement). Afterward, we observed a decline of the signal even though GABA is still present in the well, corresponding to the GABA receptor desensitization25 and to a reduction of the chloride gradient due to the efflux of the ion. The longer time (minutes vs seconds) required to obtain a maximal response compared with electrophysiology is due to the signal integration aspect of QP-DHM,17 which is sensitive to the number of ions having passed through the membrane. Consistently, we accessed the EC50 of GABA by simply measuring the effect at a single time point (8 min) after medium replacement, which is also the timing we used for all the screening assays.",

This discrepancy can be explained by both the rise time, which is about 500 times longer (for ivermectin) than that for GABA, and the absence of desensitization (for both).27 Since with QP-DHM the compounds are not washed, they have more time to produce an effect (especially with both a low rise-time and a lack of desensitization), resulting in a lower estimated EC50 value. Avermectin B1a has a dose-dependent effect (activation or inhibition),28 shortened rise time, and persistent effect,29 leading to a larger total ion flux when the compounds are not washed, and thus can similarly explain the higher EC50 value recorded by electrophysiology in our conditions. Nevertheless, QP-DHM is in very good agreement with the reported EC50 value of 1.9 \u00b5M.29",

Muscimol, which was present in the collection screened, was detected as an agonist delivering pharmacological parameters as reported and was also obtained in our pilot screen in the agonist mode. Besides this well-known agonist detected without prior knowledge of the content of the chemical collection, the other compounds belong to two distinct chemical families (neurosteroid and avermectin-like) based on their structure. Alphaxalone is a neurosteroid previously reported as a potentiator and agonist at high concentration.39 The compound STOCK1N-56888 detected in the primary screening has been discarded due to quality control issues. This compound, which was annotated by the supplier to be 17\u03b1-hydroxypregnanolone, did not pass our quality control check by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for peak purity and mass assignment (data not shown). Since the mass obtained for this compound was the same as that for alphaxalone, the two compounds were co-injected and analyzed by LC. Two distinct well-resolved peaks were obtained demonstrating that the compound STOCK1N-56888 cannot be alphaxalone. Further NMR analyses confirmed that the supplied compound was not the expected one. However, even if a neurosteroid backbone is suggested by our data, an unambiguous structural assignment was not possible; therefore, this compound was not retained as a validated hit. Moreover, the structure corresponding to 17\u03b1-hydroxypregnanolone is not following the structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) rules for GABAA active neurosteroids,40 suggesting that the compound delivered as 17\u03b1-hydroxypregnanolone could be another active neurosteroid or a mixture (Suppl. Fig. S4). This mistake from the chemical compound supplier that we were able to detect highlights the need for thorough quality control of compounds used in chemical screening and in particular for validating hits.",

Some small differences observed between the two techniques, notably when receptor desensitization occurred (like with ivermectin), can also be explained by the fact that compounds were only applied for 30 s and then washed out with electrophysiology (bath application in open perfusion chamber) or applied continuously (inside well plate without perfusion) for QP-DHM. However, this less rapid timescale offers a larger time frame for imaging and provides more versatility for recording the cell response. In addition, the overall time needed to perform the experiments was much smaller. For instance, the data presented in \nFigure 3A\n were obtained and analyzed automatically in a 1 h experiment with QP-DHM (from the scan of a 96-well plate in duplicate), while 3 days of multiple-cell patching for electrophysiology from an experienced user was required (Fig. 3B).",

The results obtained from the larger blind screen constituted an additional confirmation of the robustness and applicability of the approach in a high-throughput context where identified specific GABAA agonists were validated without the need for further electrophysiology-based experiments. The false-positive compounds (compounds that were hits in the screen but later discarded as also being active in the validation test on wild-type HEK cells) were \u03b1-peltatin, podophyllotoxin glucoside, teniposide-related compound A, centaureidin, meleagrin, vindesine, and colchicine, as well as two compounds from the Swiss Chemical Collection, provided by the same academic lab, and both derivatives of benzamide backbones. Among these nine compounds, seven are known to target directly or indirectly the dynamics of microtubules, mainly through inhibition of tubulin polymerization (the other two being original molecules not previously described). It is therefore expected that such compounds, acting on microtubule dynamics, can ultimately display an effect on almost all cellular processes besides the potential GABAergic effect, whatever the readout, but mainly linked to differences in timings, reflecting differences in modes of action. For instance, meleagrin is a precursor of oxaline (similar to roquefortine) and classified as a tremorgenic mycotoxin, which is thought to inhibit the GABA receptor and have an effect on microtubules.45",
