This article is a first look at the amount of conversation taking place on social media, specifically Twitter, with respect to COVID-19, the themes of discussion, where the discussion is emerging from, myths shared about the virus, and how much of it is connected to other high and low quality information on the Internet through shared URL links. Our preliminary findings suggest that a meaningful spatio-temporal relationship exists between information flow and new cases of COVID-19, and while discussions about myths and links to poor quality information exist, their presence is less dominant than other crisis specific themes. This research is a first step toward understanding social media conversation about COVID-19.",

The avalanche of human response is being facilitated by the flow of information from the broadcast world of traditional media but, in particular, by the networked world of social media.",

First, we expect social media to play an even bigger role in the spread of information about COVID-19; for example, there were 255 million active Twitter users in February 2014 during the start of the Ebola outbreak [17] . This number topped 330 million in 2019 [18] . Put simply, a lot more people are connecting to others online and getting their news through social media platforms such as Twitter [3, 4] . Second, there is reason to be more concerned about the quality of such information in today's news ecosystem compared to that of earlier epidemics. As recent research shows, trust in institutions is eroding [19] and this is accompanied by an uptick in the spread of misinformation online. Therefore, it is crucial to study and understand the conversation surrounding the fast-moving COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of social media.",

We also identify and look at the overall and temporal level of discussion of five specific myths shared on Twitter. We pause to mention that all of the signals we are measuring and using are, at best, moderate quality indicators from social media to reported cases of COVID-19. But it is precisely because we do not have access to high quality indicators that we must take the time to calibrate moderate and poor quality indicators, glean insight from these indicators, and understand their relationship to each other.

Figure 1 shows the overall volume of tweets, and the volume of tweets and retweets separately. Initial tweets about COVID-19 were relatively infrequent. It is not surprising that both the tweet and retweet volume continue to increase as the epidemic unfolds. What is interesting is that there is no single event that has propelled the increase. The peak volume days map to a series of events unfolding throughout the crisis. There was a significant ramping up in late January around the 25th. On January 24th, multiple countries, including Japan, South Korea, and the United States, reported cases, and the increasing number of cases in China led the Chinese government to begin a quarantine in the Hubei province [20] . On January 25th, Hong Kong de- clared a state of emergency and the United States also announced plans to evacuate US citizens from Wuhan [21] . This was followed by a tapering off in the first half of February. During this time, the cases continued to grow around the world, but little government action was taking place outside of Asia. At the end of February, another large increase in volume occurred. That was when the number of deaths in Iran and Italy grew over 30 and 20, respectively, and Switzerland banned all gatherings/events larger than 1000 people. February 29th was also the date of the first death due to COVID-19 in the United States [22] . Following that time period, there was an overall increasing trend, with volume essentially doubling from the first to the second week in March. 2 Essentially, this suggests that attention to COVID-19 has increased significantly over the last two months, and is growing at a faster rate in March than in January.",

While English and Spanish are generally dominant languages on Twitter (see Figure 3 ), we see that the language distribution for COVID-19 tweets does vary from the overall Twitter population [23] [1] . Given their significant outbreaks, we might have expected more tweets in Chinese (81,048 confirmed cases) and German (3,795 confirmed cases), although Twitter use in both countries is relatively low (Twitter is blocked in China, although some people use VPN to get around that limitation; Twitter is used by only 9.8% of adults in Germany [24] ). The languages that are more prevalent on Twitter but not as represented in the COVID-19 tweets when considering the overall distribution of language on Twitter are Indonesian, Arabic, and Malay.",

Figure 4a shows the higher volume of tweets in January and early February in Chinese, and a contrasting view of volume for the tweets in English. For English, there is a small spike in January, with a decrease in volume until late February. This is when more cases began emerging in North America and Europe. The trend that English follows is similar for French, German, Italian, Spanish and Turkish -an initial increase followed by a period of low discussion followed by a large increase and spikes in March. This can be seen in Figure 4b . Spanish, being spoken significantly in North America and Europe and having a large Twitter user base has the highest increase. Finally, Figure 4c shows a contrast in two predominantly Asian Languages, Japanese and Thai. After an initial spike in January when initial cases were confirmed in both these countries, the volume of Japanese conversation has been fairly constant. In contrast, the volume of Thai tweets had a very high spike in January and a high one in March. This difference in trend may be related to doubling in the number of cases reported in Thailand between late February and min-March and the first COVID-19 death in March [25] .",

            "text": "We use two sets of Twitter data to look into this. The first set is extracted from our Twitter data with location mentions; for example, if both China and COVID-19 are mentioned in a tweet, that tweet will be assigned to China regardless of where that tweet is sent from. We refer to this set of tweets as conversation location tweets. To determine the locations mentioned in the tweet, we compare the words in the tweet to a location ontology we created using Wikipedia and Statoids [27] that contains cities, provinces, states, and countries. 3 Our second data set contains geotagged tweets, which are tweets that users choose to tag with a longitude and latitude location (this is relatively rare, as it is not the default setting in Twitter). This allows us to track with greater confidence where the tweets come from. We were able to collect 100% of the existing geotagged tweets mentioning any of our hashtags through the Twitter API. Our final data set comes from the World Health Organization. It contains the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in different countries as of March 15, 2020 [1] . Figure 5 shows two maps each containing the COVID-19 reported case count and one of our Twitter location data sets. Figure 5a illustrates the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the number of conversation location tweets by country. 217 countries were mentioned and 184 of them were mentioned at least 10 times. Overall, it appears that conversation location tweets and confirmed cases of COVID-19 are highly correlated; countries that have more cases also have more conversation location tweets (tweets that mention the country itself or a location in that country). Among the conversation location tweets, COVID-19 was mentioned the most in China, followed by the USA, India, Iran, and Italy. It makes sense that China has the most COVID-19 mentions from January 16 to March 15, when China was the epicenter of COVID-19. The USA has the second highest tweet mentions, although the USA ranks only 8th place in terms of cases by March 15; this is likely because the USA has the largest Twitter user population and the most Asian immigrants, who may have been following COVID-19 trends earlier than other population groups. Figure 5b maps the number of geotagged tweet mentions of COVID-19 by country. Note that these tweets were sent out from the corresponding countries and that so far we have collected geotagged tweets in English only. The United States has the most geotagged tweet mentions of COVID-19, followed by the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Nigeria, China, Spain, and India. It is not surprising that the United States and the United Kingdom have the most geotagged tweet mentions since both are English speaking countries and our geotagged tweets are limited to English only. During the study period, Italy has the second most COVID-19 cases and the third most geotagged tweet mentions. It is interesting that although Twitter is restricted in China and most Chinese people speak Chinese only, China has the sixth most geotagged tweet mentions from January 16 to March 15, when China was the epicenter of the COVID-19. When we compute the Pearson correlation between the volumes of the location conversation tweets and the geotagged tweets by countries, we get a correlation of 0.75, if we exclude China from the calculation. While not a perfect proxy for geotagged tweets, it is a reasonable one.",

This initial analysis focuses on the time series of the location conversation tweets and the newly identified and confirmed COVID-19 cases each day. We compute the Pearson correlation between time series of location conversation tweets and COVID-19 cases with different leads and lags to determine if a relationship exists between the two variables.

The numbers in bold are the highest correlations for each country. If the highest and second highest correlation values are within 0.01 of each other, we highlight both. A lead refers to the tweets occurring before the cases; for example, a two-day lead means that we match the tweet conversations with the number of new cases two days later. In contrast, a lag refers to the tweets occurring after the cases; a two-day lag means that we match the tweet conversations with the We find that social media conversations are more highly correlated with COVID-19 cases with a lead than with a lag (Table 1) . That is, it seems that tweets increase in volume before confirmed cases increase in a given country. This suggests that social media conversations may be a leading indicator of disease cases, which can be explained by the lag between symptom onset and the progression of severe symptoms leading to testing (though this might depend on different protocols for testing implemented in different countries). Additionally, we find that conversations mentioning COVID-19 and locations in the United States, Italy and China-B all show a strong association to confirmed cases. This result suggests that the association between conversations and cases is indicative of both a direct effect and an indirect effect given the lack of Twitter usage in China. We also find that the lead time of 2 days for the US (Figure 6a ), 4-5 days for Italy (Figure 6b) , and 4-5 days for China-B (Figure 6c ) demonstrate the strongest correlations between location conversation mentions and confirmed cases.",

The words that do not belong in any of these categories (e.g. stop words) are removed. Word variations were also added (e.g. plurals) to increase coverage.

We observe that most Twitter conversations are about one of two topics: either health/the virus itself or the global nature of the pandemic. It is not surprising since these categories contain a larger number of broader terms about the pandemic. The first category includes conversations about the virus itself, broader health consequences, vaccines, testing, and references to other epidemics. This accounts for 30% of the labeled content. The second similarly-sized theme is the global nature of COVID-19. Twitter users Table 3 .: Summary of the themes identified using most frequent words in tweets. are commonly referring to locations around the world where the disease is spreading (e.g. China, Italy) and referring to its scale (e.g. pandemic, worldwide). This theme accounts for 29% of labeled content. The next biggest theme is information providers (11%). This suggests that a sizable number of tweets are referring to or talking about sources of information about the disease (e.g. CDC or news media). In the time period we consider, the economy theme was rather rare (3%). This fact might change over time if disease control improves and the immediate effects of the disease are overshadowed by secondary effects, including possible economic consequences. Finally, we note that the emotion theme, containing words like fear, sad, hope, makes up 9% of the labeled tweets. This is a significant fraction, and a reminder that attention needs to be given to mental health needs during this crisis. As the epidemic grows and evolves, it is plausible that the themes and their prevalence will also evolve. Therefore, we next inspect the time series of the prevalence of the top five themes. The results are summarized in Figure 9 . We observe that all the themes have a similar trend to the trend of the overall volume for COVID-19 hashtags. The global nature of the disease and the health/virus themes are the most common theme early on. This is likely due to tweets referring to China when talking about COVID-19 and general conversation about the virus and cases. Starting with the last week of February, as the reality sets in that COVID-19 is spreading in the United States, all the themes become more popular, highlighting the continued diversity of the conversation.

Figure 11 shows the distribution of the volume of each myth discussed. Tweet volume associated with the myths in our sample has increased since January, although this may reflect the growing conversation surrounding COVID-19 generally, rather than a greater proportion of attention devoted to these topics (see Figure 12 ). However, some trends are growing more than others. Specifically, the myth regarding the origins of the virus dominated the myths present on Twitter in January and February. By the end of February, however, the flu comparison myth and the home remedy myth appear almost equally as often in our data set, although there is some suggestive evidence that the flu comparison myth may have dropped off at the end of our data collection in mid-March. While myths about heat killing COVID-19 and vaccine development also appear to rise over time in our data set, they maintain their relative position compared to the other myths and may simply reflect growing conversation surrounding the topic. It is important to note that tweets that are countering or debunking a particular myth are also likely to be part of this set of identified tweets. Therefore, the numbers we are reporting here likely capture tweets that perpetuate a myth, as well as those combating it.

However, sources that we can confidently label as producers of misinformation (through domains identified as purveyors of misinformation by a journalism organization) are also not shared in great numbers (11,654 original tweets linked to such a source), even though they are retweeted more often (11, 415) than credible health sources (8, 813) .
