            "text": "The domestic intercity transport system experienced a revolutionary transformation in China during the past decade with the development of high-speed rail (HSR) in the early 2000s. Unlike any HSR in the world, the HSR in China now has the largest network consisting of eight east-west-bound and eight north-south-bound HSR passenger dedicated lines (PDL), with a total track length of over 19,000 km. These new high-speed train services generally operate on dedicated track which can allow operating speeds of 250 km/h or even higher. Because of this high transport capacity and travel speed, the intercity travel demand may have been induced considerably. For instance, as illustrated in Fig. 1\n, the passenger railway demand has experienced a rapid growth from 2003 to 2013. The ridership on travel distances ranging from 101 to 501 km experienced the fastest growth. In terms of passenger-km traveled, distances over a thousand km accounted for the largest share of the total passenger-km traveled, however, it is actually the rail trip ranging from 501 to 1000 km that increased the most. These statistics confirm that passenger rail travel in China has changed fundamentally in the past decade, which may have serious consequences for air transport.",

For instance, as indicated by Chen and Haynes (2015), the Air Express service between Chengdu and Chongqing was discontinued in November 2009 after nineteen years of operation following the opening of the intercity HSR serving the same corridor. One month later, the operation of the Wuhan-Guangzhou HSR led to the cancellation of the Hainan Airline's service between those two cities. One year later, the operation of Zhengzhou-Xi'an HSR also led to a cancellation of all air services between the two cities in March 2010. It is likely that the impact upon air transportation services may be felt in more services as additional HSR services are provided.",

Considering an \u201cideal\u201d travel time for an intercity trip can range from one to 4 hours (Givoni, 2006), HSR, which normally runs at a speed of over 250 km/h or higher, is considered competitive for trips between 160 and 800 km (Button, 2012), whereas air is preferable for a longer distance. Market characteristics reflect the values that travelers place upon travel cost and time, and also reflect the size of the cities involved in the link. These different attitudes can be felt in different levels of demand for services.",

First, since most HSR services in China were opened recently (after 2010), there is a lack of sufficient data to capture the dynamic response of aviation service to the new competition Second, the assessment of the temporal and spatial evolution of the Chinese HSR system is challenging due to the complicated nature of its construction. Since the development of such a gigantic infrastructure system involves a multistage planning, financing and construction, the HSR lines have been completed at different times. As a result, it is difficult to generalize about the effect of competition between HSR and domestic air transportation. To capture the completion effect more accurately, we need timelines of HSR opening schedules as well as matching air transport data to provide an informed empirical assessment of impacts, and to predict likely future effects.",

(2015) and Wan et al. (2016). The classical approach involves an assessment from a supply perspective (Dobruszkes, 2011) or utilizing travel demand modeling (Behrens and Pels, 2012, Clever and Hansen, 2008, Cascetta et al., 2011, Pagliara et al., 2012, Park and Ha, 2006; Steer Davies Gleave, 2006), which suggest that the competition between HSR and air is limited to the medium-distance travel market. Givoni and Dobruszkes (2013) extended this thinking by suggesting the majority of the HSR demand is from induced demand and the substitution of demand from conventional trains, so that one-on-one comparisons with air are more complicated than first thought.",

On the supply side Albalate et al. (2015) conducted an econometric analysis based on a dataset of air services in Spain. Their study confirms that the supply of airline service measured in number of seats did reduce after the operation of HSR, however, when the supply of air service was measured in flight frequency, the result shows that air service did not suffer a significant reduction. On the demand side, Behrens and Pels (2012) assessed the competition between HSR and air using enplanement as a proxy.

This also reflects the fact that the treated/control group ratio is very small. In fact, as illustrated in Table 2\n, there were only four major HSR PDLs (with a distance of over 400 km) in operation by the end of 2012 (excluding those opened in the fourth quarter of 2012). All these suggest that their estimation tends to be biased due to the limited number of HSRs included as part of their analysis. Second, difference-in-difference (DID) is not an appropriate method for the evaluation of HSR in China. One of the key assumptions of the DID approach is that the control group and the treated group should have parallel trends over time in the absence of the treatment. In effect, the approach is more appropriate to a short-term scenario. As discussed earlier, HSR development in China has spanned at least five years, or longer in some locations. The entire HSR network covers over 28 provinces and municipalities but many HSR routes began operation on different dates. As a result, it becomes quite challenging to separate the HSR effect from the control group if the DID approach is adopted. In sum, this review point to the need for a new approach that can accommodate the complex space and time context of the Chinese experience.",

As can be seen in Fig. 2\n, the majority of this growth was concentrated upon travel between a few major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chengdu, which have an annual enplanement over 35 million each in 2014.\n",

The graphs show the response of demand and supply of domestic air service was substantial among different OD pairs after the entry of HSR. Fig. 3 provides data on outcomes on two lines, with links between cities enroute. Fig. 3(a) and (c) records results for the 968 km line between Wuhan and Guangzhou, the first long-distance trunk HSR line built where the service began on December 26, 2009. This line also connects Changsha in the middle and Shenzhen in the South. With a top speed of 300 km/h, travel time by HSR between Wuhan and Guangzhou has been reduced to 3.5 h. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (c), both the demand and supply of the air service along this corridor experienced a substantial decline after the opening of HSR in December 2009. For instance, from 2009 to 2012, the air travel demand between Guangzhou - Changsha decreased by 67%, while flights declined by 55% and between Shenzhen - Changsha demand fell 68% while flights declined 53% (Chen and Haynes, 2015). Closer study of the data shows that the initial competitive effect of the HSR seems to have dampened down in recent years on the Guangzhou\u2013Wuhan and Shenzhen\u2013Wuhan links. Some similar responses are also observed in change in air travel and services along the Beijing-Shanghai corridor after the HSR began operation in June 2011 (see Fig. 3(b) and (d) where major declined are recorded on the links between Beijing - Nanjing, Shanghai - Tianjin, Beijing - Jinan, and Shanghai \u2013 Jinan. However, the competitive effect of the HSR on air travel from Beijing and Shanghai has been different. It has experienced a decline after the HSR operation, but that decline is not as intensive as on the other routes, and is showing a trend to recover its earlier level. This may be attributed to a very strong demand for intercity travel between Beijing and Shanghai due to the complex and high level economic and political functions of both cities, which makes this the busiest air route within China. Once again, on this line, there is some evidence of a shift back to air services in links between Shanghai and Tianjin and Beijing and Nanjing.",

(2016) adopted 500 km as the lower bound and 800 km as the upper bound. Scholars tend to agree that the optimal competitive distance of HSR is 3\u20134 h (Fu et al., 2012) beyond which air transport is favored by the majority of travelers. That still leaves a large distance for competition, especially at high speeds. So the 3\u20134 h band translates into 750\u20131000 km at 250 km/h but reaches out to 900\u20131200 km at 300 km/h.

Route specific impact analysis is also critical as the Chinese HSR system was implemented in different phases and served different regions at different times, so the analysis needs to limit the comparison of OD pairs to certain groups within the affected geographic boundaries.

(2015) and built and extended with considerations of the demand for air service as well as a richer data range. The unit of observation is air service route-year for each city pair, in other words, an observation represents a specific OD city pair's air service in a given year. The primary data such as enplanement, flight frequencies and seat capacities are collected from the annual statistics of aviation publication From a Statistical Look at the Civil Aviation for the period 2001\u20132014. The raw data contains 792 domestic airline routes with a total number of 6263 observations. However, the dataset is unbalanced as quite a few air routes only have data statistics in one or two years. Hence, to achieve a consistent panel assessment, a data filtering process is implemented to exclude those air service routes with observations of less than a decade. The cleaned data after this filtering includes 3834 observations with 295 OD city pairs. The level of competition between HSR and air is measured by the estimated elasticity of demand and supply changes in air transportation after the operation of HSR through the following equations:(1)lnPassengerit=\u03b1+\u03b21lnWPOPit+\u03b22lnWGDPPCit+\u03b23lnDistancei+\u03b24Hubi+\u03b25HSRit+\u03b26Y03t+\u03b27Y08t+trend+\u03b5it\n(2)lnFrequencyit=\u03b1+\u03b21lnWPOPit+\u03b22lnWGDPPCit+\u03b23lnDistancei+\u03b24Hubi+\u03b25HSRit+\u03b26Y03t+\u03b27Y08t+trend+\u03b5it\n(3)lnSeatit=\u03b1+\u03b21lnWPOPit+\u03b22lnWGDPPCit+\u03b23lnDistancei+\u03b24Hubi+\u03b25HSRit+\u03b26Y03t+\u03b27Y08t+trend+\u03b5itwhere the dependent variables are number of enplanement (Passenger), number of flight (Frequency) and number of seats (Seat) offered by airlines serving route i in year t. Note that since all variables except the dummies are measured in logarithmical forms, the \u03b2 estimate is interpreted as elasticity. The demand side impact of HSR on air transport is measured through Eq. (1), whereas the supply side impact is measured through Eqs. (2), (3).

Instead, the Sargen-Hansen test using the Stata command xtoverid is adopted. The test is known as a generalized test for over-identifying restrictions between fixed and random effects of a panel data model. A significant test value suggests that the extra restrictions imposed by the random effect model are rejected, hence a fixed effect estimator is preferred, otherwise, a random effect is preferred.

The influences of HSR on the air service supply are also found to be statistically significant, but with different estimates across each model. Specifically, when comparing the results across the fixed effect models, the national level assessment shows that the impacts of HSR on the domestic flight number and seats are \u2212 0.283 and \u2212 0.327, whereas the estimates were found to be \u2212 0.339 and \u2212 0.382 when the dataset only include hub city-pairs, and \u2212 0.145 and \u2212 0.196 when only non-hub city-pairs are included, respectively.
