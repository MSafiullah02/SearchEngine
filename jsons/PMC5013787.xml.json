            "text": "Emerging pathogens that cross the species barrier to infect new hosts pose an important threat to human and animal health. Despite the high morbidity and mortality due to some emerging infections, the evolution of sustained transmission cycles in a novel host following a species jump is a relatively rare occurrence. Rather, many, if not most, emergence events in reality reflect isolated \u2018spillover\u2019 events in which a pathogen causes infection in a new host but without large-scale onward transmission. An informative example is provided by the highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype of avian influenza A virus. Although this virus is primarily associated with outbreaks in wild and domestic birds (i.e. poultry), since 2003 it has caused over 800 laboratory-confirmed cases in humans in 16 countries, with more than 400 deaths [1]. Despite these repeated \u2018spillover\u2019 events, H5N1 has not been able to evolve sustained human-to-human transmission, likely because of a lack of airborne transmission. Experimental studies suggest that H5N1 may only require five amino acid substitutions across the viral genome to become transmissible, between ferrets, by respiratory droplet or aerosols [2]. Although it is uncertain whether these same mutations will lead to productive infections in humans, or if other evolutionary pathways can be followed, the emergence of a novel airborne virus such as H5N1 to which humans are immunologically naive and highly susceptible would clearly be of major public health importance [3].",

            "text": "To establish a productive infection in a new host a virus must overcome multiple evolutionary and ecological barriers [4]. From an evolutionary perspective, these barriers can be described in terms of an \u2018adaptive landscape\u2019 in which species jumps are depicted as a fitness valley. Critically, the more phylogenetically divergent the host species, then on average, the steeper the fitness valley [5]. Fitness valleys are likely to be especially steep in the case of host range because mutations that optimize a virus' ability to infect a (new) recipient host will, at the same time, often be deleterious for the virus in the (original) donor host (figure 1a) [6,7]. As a case in point, Herfst and colleagues used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and serial passage to enable the H5N1 virus to acquire the five mutations necessary for airborne transmission in ferrets [2]. Although surveillance data have revealed that two of these mutations are already present in avian H5N1 viruses [3,8,9], their collective absence (particularly within the same animal) implies that they are deleterious, especially in combination. Hence, the successful adaptation of H5N1 to mammalian transmission cycles represents a steep fitness valley that has yet to be crossed. In addition, even if a virus is able to acquire the necessary genetic modifications it must also adapt to accommodate the behaviour and ecology of the recipient species to enable its sustained transmission. This fundamental interplay between genetics and ecology can be illustrated by the following examples observed in nature (figure 1b):\nPanel 1. The genetic and ecological barriers to successful emergence are seemingly low in the case of influenza A virus in pigs and humans. The relationship between swine and human influenza was noted during the global influenza pandemic of 1918\u20131919 [10], and serological surveillance has revealed the presence of human influenza viruses in swine populations worldwide [11]. Importantly, swine are susceptible to both avian and human influenza viruses and as such have been hypothesized to act as \u2018mixing vessels\u2019 for novel virus strains [12], although more recent work suggests that pigs may be more at risk of human infections than the reverse [13] and hence may not be evolutionary \u2018intermediates\u2019 [14]. Successful \u2018ecological adaptation\u2019 of a swine virus to a recipient (human) host occurred during the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic, which resulted in an estimated 100 000\u2013400 000 human deaths worldwide [15].Panels 2 and 3. While birds are likely the natural reservoir for influenza A viruses, transmission from birds to mammalian species, including humans, is relatively rare. Although occupational exposure to poultry seemingly provides ample ecological opportunity for adaptation, avian influenza virus generally results in dead-end spillover events in which onward transmission among humans is limited (or non-existent) because the virus lacks the necessary mammal-specific mutations. The recent appearance of highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses, characterized by multiple spillovers into humans but little or no onward transmission, present informative cases of this effect [16].Panel 4. Equine-derived H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV) is an example of a virus that appears to be genetically well adapted to transmission among dogs, but ecologically constrained due to the lack of sufficient host contact networks. This has resulted in a highly patchy distribution, characterized by sporadic and short-lived outbreaks in the United States, often confined to animal shelters [17], but a marked lack of sustained transmission in most (domestic) dog populations that may be too small and sparse to support ongoing transmission. Hence, although a pathogen may possess all the mutations required to successfully infect a new host, whether it establishes itself is also dependent on the underlying population ecology. Interestingly, a new H3N2 CIV of avian origin has emerged in Asia and, more recently, in North America [18]. Whether, or how, this virus differs in transmissibility from the H3N8 variant is currently unknown. As dogs are susceptible to both mammalian (equine) and avian influenza viruses, they, like pigs, have the potential to become mixing vessels, although there is no evidence that this has happened to date [14].An additional factor that may act as a barrier to viral emergence is that most forms of transmission involve a major population bottleneck, in which a limited number of randomly sampled individuals (virions) create a new founding (inoculum) population. Such a sharp reduction in population size can severely reduce genetic variation and hence is likely to have profound effects on the population structure of the evolving virus [19]. Unfortunately, formal estimates of bottleneck size for virus transmission between animal hosts in nature are limited. For example, many studies suggest that the founding virus population for HIV is a single genotype for both vertical and horizontal transmission [20], and between one and two genotypes have been estimated to initiate new HCV infections [21]. These estimates rely on measuring changes in the extent of genetic diversity between the infected source and the new infection. Crucially, however, the actual number of transmitted virions in natural infections, as opposed to the number of transmitted genotypes, remains largely unknown. Somewhat more is known about bottleneck size during virus transmission among plants, where experimental manipulation is easier. In these cases, estimates also predict an extremely narrow bottleneck of between 0.5\u20133.2 virions for insect-borne transmission [22] and 1.3\u20133.3 virus particles for leaf-contact transmission [23].\n",

Here, we explore the likelihood of successful adaptation of a virus that jumps from a donor to a recipient species, incorporating a variety of fitness landscapes and population bottlenecks of differing magnitude. In particular, we consider two specific models of viral emergence. In the first, termed the \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 model [24,25], host adaptation occurs when the virus population transmitted from the donor to the recipient contains, by chance, all of those mutations required to successfully adapt to a new host species without the need for further mutation [26]. As an alternative, we investigate the likelihood of emergence under a \u2018tailor-made\u2019 model [24,25], in which viruses may adapt (i.e. generate and potentially fix beneficial mutations) in the recipient, thereby enabling successful onward transmission in the new host species. By modelling intra- and interhost virus evolutionary dynamics, and exploring a diverse range of parameters for fitness and transmission events, we aim to come to a better understanding of how such factors may impact the emergence of novel viruses.",

This recipient host itself then experiences an infection also lasting approximately 5 days, before we quantify the status of the infection (i.e. the number of virions and their level of adaptation).",

Therefore, each virion has a genotype with five loci, each of which may be either wild-type (0) or mutated (1). The probability of a locus mutating from one state to the other (m; all parameters and variables are given in electronic supplementary material, table S1) is equal across virions, loci and states. We use a mutation rate that is typical for influenza viruses, at 10\u22125 mutations per site, per genome replication [27]. Analogous to a two-allele five-locus haploid model, a total of 25 = 32 possible genotypes exist. However, for simplicity, we assume that virions with n mutations have equivalent fitness regardless of their position in the genome. A virion's fitness is defined by its probability of replicating and producing progeny, which is a function of the number of mutations carried and the host in which a virus finds itself. We explored eight different functions of genotype (number of mutations) on fitness (probability of replicating; figure 2a). In terms of the fitness landscape described earlier, this can be envisaged as a measure of the slope of the fitness valley, in which a severe fitness effect reflects a steeper fitness valley between hosts. The fitness functions, therefore, ranged from very steep to progressively more shallow, which are referred to as f1 to f6. We also considered two additional fitness functions, f7 and f8, that reflect differences in fitness effects between the hosts (figure 2a; electronic supplementary material, table S1). Under f7, viral mutations in the donor host have very little effect on fitness (equivalent to f6), but a large effect once transmitted to the recipient host (equivalent to f1). By contrast, f8 represents the opposing case (i.e. f1 in the donor and f6 in the recipient).\n",

The model is then run for 20 iterations in this host, analogous to a typical round of influenza replication lasting 6 h over a 5-day infection. Although there is a broad consensus that duration of replication for influenza is approximately 6\u20138 h [28,29], we recognize that this might vary such that peak viral titres in some cell types are achieved at approximately 12 h. For this reason, we later varied this parameter, running the model for both 15 and 10 viral generations, which is analogous to the duration of replication lasting 8 and 12 h, respectively. On each iteration of the model, each virion (i) survives and (ii) replicates with a given probability. Accordingly, one iteration is equivalent to one viral generation. The probability that a virion survives generation-to-generation is density-dependent and is implemented as a logistic regression where survival is predicted by density as given by:2.1where e is the natural exponent; \u03b1S is the log odds probability of surviving when the density is 0 (i.e. the intercept in the regression); \u03b2S is the effect of density on the log odds of survival (i.e. the slope) and P is the population density (total number of virions divided by the carrying capacity, which is fixed at 108 in all simulations). In all simulations we assume a negative slope, such that the probability of survival decreases as P increases. The survival probability of all virions is equally affected by density, and all parameters relating to density dependence were fixed throughout model runs. We selected parameters that allow steady population growth and then keep the population size at approximately 108 after the replication step once the carrying capacity is reached.",

Nevertheless, error-prone virus replication may provide opportunities for multiple mutations to accumulate within a single viral genome even when they are deleterious. When transmitted from a donor species to a new recipient species, new genetic variants may result in a virus that is better adapted to the new host. Similar to previously proposed frameworks [7,30], virions not fully adapted to their host always have some adverse fitness effects. Under both models studied here, pathogen emergence is dependent on the strength of positive selection on advantageous variants that enable the virus to adapt to the new host over the course of an infection, thereby allowing onward transmission among the recipient population. We explored a wide range of fitness effects, which, in terms of the adaptive landscape, can be seen as a measure of the valley between two adaptive peaks.

Under our implementation of the off-the-shelf model the probability of transmitting existing genetic variants by chance is greatly facilitated by a \u2018very loose\u2019 transmission bottleneck, observed here to be one comprising more than 0.01% of the virus population. Once transmitted, these genetic variants may increase in frequency under strong positive selection. If the fitness valley is too shallow or too steep, genetic variants remain at frequencies that are too low to enable adaptation, even when transmitted through a very loose bottleneck. Therefore, under this model, both a loose bottleneck and moderately strong positive selection represented the optimal conditions for host adaptation. Conversely, under the tailor-made model, favourable mutations that are subject to positive selection can occur during the recipient's infection, such that selection is the main driver of emergence. Nevertheless, when the fitness valley is too steep (i.e. many mutations and/or a large fitness effect), emergence is greatly hampered. Additionally, in marked contrast with the off-the-shelf model, the virus may generate a higher number of mutations, as is required for adaptation in the recipient host even when the bottleneck is severe (i.e. approx. 100 virions).",

            "text": "The size of the transmission bottleneck has a dramatic effect on the population dynamics of the evolving virus [31\u201333]. Attempts to estimate the size of real-world transmission bottlenecks outside of plants have largely been limited to studying transmission between animal models within a laboratory setting. In human infections the size of transmission bottlenecks has generally been inferred from intra-host genetic diversity by examining known chains of transmission. For example, in the case of human influenza A virus, examining the transmission events within and across households revealed the transmission of multiple genetic variants between individuals, suggestive of a relatively loose bottleneck [34]. By contrast, for HIV infections, 60\u201390% of transmissions contain just a single genotype, in marked contrast with the high levels of diversity normally observed within hosts [35]. In addition, very limited genetic diversity was seen in mammals compared with birds infected with H7N9 avian influenza virus [36], compatible with the occurrence of a severe transmission bottleneck. However, our modelling implies that even with a moderate bottleneck size of approximately 100 virions, very low levels of genetic diversity may exist in the viral population during transmission from the donor to the recipient. This lack of genetic diversity is most likely because genetic variants in the donor are frequently deleterious, and therefore, purged by purifying selection such that they have not been sampled through the bottleneck. It is also possible that multiple beneficial mutations are competing with one another (i.e. clonal interference) which will also reduce genetic diversity [37]. Hence, an observed lack of genetic diversity in a virus population sampled following inter-host transmission does not necessarily equate with the occurrence of a severe population bottleneck. Even under a shallow fitness valley, we observed that genetic diversity remained low, presumably because the infection period was too short to enable sufficient genetic variation to accumulate and be sampled by chance.",

[38] sampled exhaled particles from 37 patients within 5 days of onset of seasonal influenza and measured viral copy number using quantitative RT-PCR. Without the use of a facemask, the median number of viral copies of fine particles (less than or equal to 5 \u00b5m) exhaled was 560, with a geometric mean of 110 (95% CI: 45\u2013260). While the median number of coarse viral particles (greater than 5 \u00b5m) was below the limit of detection, there were 37 viral copies in the 75th percentile, with a geometric mean of 12 (95% CI: 4\u201337). In addition, the study provided estimates of the infectiousness of the exhaled aerosols and detected viral RNA in 92% of the fine particle samples and 43% of the coarse particle samples. On this basis, and further assuming that only a proportion of exhaled virions are successfully transmitted to a new host (such that a bottleneck size of approx. 10\u2013100 viral particles does reflect real-world parameters), we can conclude that infection may be established under the tailor-made model, but only when the fitness valley is neither too steep nor too shallow. Under the same assumptions it is similarly possible to conclude that emergence is unlikely to occur under the off-the-shelf model with any of the parameters investigated here.",

Using H5N1 as a model, we can define the probability of successful emergence as the proportion of virions that posses all five mutations required for onward transmission in the new host species. The results of our model suggest that the sustained emergence of an H5N1-like virus is extremely unlikely to occur under either model. Nevertheless, these results indicate where in parameter space host adaptation might be more likely. Indeed, analogous models of within-host adaptation found high viral loads containing one and two mutations following infection, although four or more mutations were unlikely to evolve [39]. The present model also reiterates findings from other theoretical studies that the within-host fitness landscape is dominant in shaping the probability of emergence [3], particularly in the initial host where potential evolutionary trajectories are likely to be determined [7]. The current model provides a framework that may be altered to incorporate additional parameter settings. For example, it is possible that our results are sensitive to a 5-day infection, particularly as it been suggested that an extended duration of infection that may occur within immunocompromised hosts, may be central to the generation and transmission of those mutations required for the emergence of a pandemic virus [4,39,40].",

In particular, it is possible to conceive a two-step process in which a mutation of major effect enables a leap across a steep fitness valley, followed by the later accumulation of additional mutations of minor effect that marginally optimize or reduce viral fitness in the recipient and donor, respectively [5]. Under this scenario, a mutation of major effect may allow virions to cross the valley between two adaptive zones and thus achieve a higher overall fitness in a novel host. Herein, we have explored a wide range of fitness effects for two distinct models of host adaptation and the framework we propose can be easily adjusted and implemented for a variety of pathogens, accounting for different rates of mutation, replication and transmission.",
