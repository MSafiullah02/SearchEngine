Therefore, effectively controlling the pollution from various types of indoor and outdoor sources of hazardous substances is crucial for the health and safety of human beings [3]. Buildings are vulnerable to pollutants such as chemical and biological agents [4], [5], [6], [7]. Moreover, events in the last decade, such as the outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2003) and the H1N1 Type A influenza (2009), have revealed the importance of taking more active measures to protect the environment in buildings [8], [9]. Furthermore, the increasingly serious hazy weather (i.e., fine particulate matter), especially in China, in recent years has greatly raised awareness of the need to maintain an acceptable indoor air quality [10].",

However, in most buildings with central air conditioning and ventilating systems, a large portion of old indoor air is recirculated to the air handling unit (AHU) to save energy [11], [12], [13]. The ventilation systems in these situations, therefore, act as carriers of hazardous substances [14]. The contaminants released in one room may be transported with return air into neighboring rooms or even distant rooms through the ventilation system, causing widespread exposure to a hazardous environment. Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamic distribution of contaminants in buildings with complex ventilation systems that utilize air recirculation during long time periods, such as months and years, can contribute to the overall evaluation of the exposure level of occupants to pollution, and inform the future design of more efficient ventilation systems.",

Numerous studies have used CFD simulations to study ventilation and air quality [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20].

Most of the existing work related to CFD has focused on one room, where all of the boundary conditions are known. However, in many actual buildings, different rooms are always connected with each other through ventilation systems that recirculate air. As the concentration of contaminant in return air is unknown, the concentration of contaminant in supply air is unknown as well; therefore, the predictions of the CFD simulations are usually inaccurate [24].",

There were some discrepancies between the prediction and the experimental data, which might be because the sensors cannot respond to the change of CO2 concentrations in a timely manner, resulting in the delayed readings of the sensors. Moreover, the transient concentrations at different positions have different variation characteristics because of the non-uniform distribution of indoor air parameters. Compared with the rapid rise of concentrations at positions close to the inlet (e.g., P9), the concentrations at positions close to the outlet (e.g., P6) change more slowly; therefore, no significant rise of the measured concentration occurred in the first few seconds because of the delayed response of the sensors. Although a certain discrepancy in CO2 concentration existed, no large discrepancy was observed for most of the positions. Therefore, the predicted results agreed well with the experimental results, showing that the expression Eq.

From the second hour the predicted concentrations with and without considering the time delay were close to each other. From the view point of long-time period prediction, a low effect might be caused by neglecting the time delay in the air ducts. As the predictions with time steps of 10 min and 1 h were almost the same, as illustrated in Fig. 13, the overall discrepancy in the prediction based on the time step of 1 h without considering the time delay and the prediction based on the time step of 10 min with consideration of the time delay was believed to be small, indicating an acceptable reliability of prediction.",

This alternative method can be used to determine the prediction based on the time step of 1 h when the actual structure of the air ducts is complex, and there is a heavy workload in calculating the time delay in each air duct.",

An algebraic expression based on the indices of response coefficient is applied to account for the relationship between contaminant distribution inside the room and various boundary conditions. The method is established by mathematical descriptions of the relationships between supply air concentrations in GAHUs and in inlets, return air concentration in outlets and in GAHUs, and fresh air concentrations in the total ventilation systems. Hourly supply air concentrations in the GAHUs can be easily obtained by solving a matrix, and the dynamic distribution of contaminant is then quickly calculated with an expression based on the response coefficient. The proposed method can provide long-term predictions almost without time expense, once the response coefficient is prepared in advance.",
