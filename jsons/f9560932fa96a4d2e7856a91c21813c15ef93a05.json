According to the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), a temperature above 38 .3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F) should be considered as fever necessitating a clinical assessment. The mean body temperature in healthy individuals is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), with a range of 35.6\u00b0C (96\u00b0F) to 38.2\u00b0C (100.8\u00b0F) and a slight diurnal/circadian variation of between 0.5 and 1.0\u00b0C [2, 3] . Patients with elevated temperature in the ICU are in a closed monitoring system undergoing accurate and reproducible measurements using a variety of methods (instruments and techniques) at different body sites (Table 1 .1) [4] .",

Fever, with its beneficial and deleterious effects, occurs as a response to infection, increasing several parameters of immune function (cytokine production, T-cell activation, neutrophil and macrophage function). However, the management of the critically ill febrile patient can be characterized as a diagnostic dilemma (infectious or non-infectious cause) and a response from the physician and staff (to treat or not to treat) which varies institutionally. Frequently in the same ICU fevers of mixed causes are seen on evaluation of the patient, and before the cause of fever is confirmed pharmacologic and/or mechanical antipyretic therapy is administered. This traditional point of view shows the misconceptions about the detrimental effects of fever (seizures, brain damage, etc.) and the response from the physician to psychosocial pressure, which however leads to increased medical costs (use of paracetamol, icepacks, cooling blankets) and organ dysfunction (in volume depleted patients or in those with renal and kidney diseases) despite the evidence that fever is a beneficial response to infection [5, 6] .",

The brain is protected from large proteins, such as pyrogens (15,000 -30,000 daltons), entering in a sufficient quantity by a blood-brain barrier recognizing them at certain sites known as circumventricular organs, which represent small neuronal cell groups with fenestrated capillaries allowing neurons to come into contact with different circulating substances directly from the bloodstream. This leakage allows the central nervous system to sense the presence of endogenous pyrogens, which lead to the production of fever from the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (direct response of the neurons within the organum vasculosum to cytokines or response of astrocytes or microglia to cytokines by producing prostaglandins) [8] . The interaction of the cytokine receptors leads to phospholipase A 2 production, arachidonic acid liberation as substrate for the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway and elevation of prostaglandin E 2 levels, decreasing the rate of firing of sensitive neurons and leading to decreased heat loss and increased heat production [9, 10] . The role of COX-2 is important because these components induce fever development while its activity is inhibited by selective inhibitors including NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and acetaminophen [11] . The febrile response is characterized by endocrine/ metabolic, autonomic and behavioral components ( Fig. 1.1 ) [8] . A slight elevation of body temperature improves the efficiency of macrophages in killing invading bacteria, impairs the replication of many microorganisms, minimizes the availability of glucose (substrate for bacterial growth), reduces the demands of muscles for energy expenditure, produces acute-phase reactants which bind divalent cations necessary for the proliferation of microorganisms and increases cortisol and corticotropin secretion, aiding the organism to cope with the stress. The beneficial effects of fever have been shown (a) in mammalian models where the increased body temperature led to enhanced resistance to infection and (b) in clinical trials in adults with a positive correlation between maximum temperature on the bacteremia day and survival or between a temperature > 38\u00b0C and survival in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [12, 13] . The deleterious effects of fever affect mainly patients with cardiorespiratory symptoms (poorly tolerated due to the increased cardiac output, elevated oxygen consumption, increased carbon dioxide production and elevated energy expenditure) and neurosurgical patients with head injuries or cerebrovascular accidents (moderate elevations of brain temperature exacerbate the resulting injury) [14, 15] .",

Wound infections are caused mainly by the skin flora of the head (group A streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus) or by gram-negative pathogens after open-head trauma resulting in low-grade fevers where the diagnosis is simple with the aid of culture materials. Postoperative meningitis is common after open-head trauma procedures characterized by a persistent fever after the initial postoperative period. The diagnosis is made by Gram's stain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture. Posterior fossa syndrome mimics meningitis, presenting stiff neck, low level of glucose/increased level of protein and predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF. These findings are consequences of blood insertion in CSF, and the differential diagnosis from bacterial meningitis is based on the negative cultures and the gradual lessening of meningeal symptoms as the number of red blood cells decreases in the CSF with time [18] . Other causes include central fever resistant to antipyretics (intracranial lesion, trauma affecting the brain or hypothalamus) which exceeds 39\u00b0C (106\u00b0F) and which is characterized by absence of perspiration, anticonvulsive medications and deep venous thrombosis including fat embolism in trauma patients [18] . Pyrexia in the acute phase after head injury is extremely frequent and deleterious for cerebral perfusion pressure (CCP) affecting intracranial pressure (ICP) [19] . In tense patients antipyretic therapy is poorly effective for controlling body temperature and is correlated with a longer ICU stay [19] .",

            "text": "Fever due to drug hypersensitivity reaction or socalled \"drug fever\" is a non-infectious cause of fever characterized by unknown incidence (3 -7 % of febrile episodes are attributed to drug reactions but many more cases remain undiagnosed), a temperature range of 38.8\u00b0C (102\u00b0F) to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), difficult diagnosis (usually established by exclusion because of the nonspecific signs and laboratory tests), shaking chills and spiking temperatures [1, 22] . The usual scenario in the ICU includes a critically ill patient in whom the infection is resolved and after an initial defervescence in temperature a recurrence of fever is noticed. In this patient if the infection has resolved or has not been detected at other sites, the antibiotics should be stopped. If the patient is clinically stable but the infection has not been resolved the antibiotics should be changed to a combination with the same spectrum of pathogens but without sensitizing potential. The presumed offending agent in suspected drug fever should be withdrawn. Taking into account the difficult diagnosis of drug fever, the clinician has to evaluate non-specific signs or symptoms, to avoid needless therapy and to discontinue with safety the offending medication. A concomitant maculopapular rash makes the diagnosis simple but accompanies the fever in only 5 -10 % of cases. Rarely present are an increased WBC count with a left shift, a moderate elevation of serum transaminases, peripheral eosinophilia and a markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (> 100 mm/h). Drug fever is associated with a lack of appropriate pulse rate response and a relative bradycardia (in the absence of intrinsic conduction defects or beta-blockade) [23] . The medications considered as high risk for drug-fever development are all antibiotics (especially [ -lactams), diuretics, [ -methyldopa, quinidine, hydralazine, procainamide, diphenylhydantoin, antiseizures and stool softeners. Antibiotics with minimal risk for drug-fever development include clindamycin, vancomycin, chloramphenicol, aztreonam, doxycycline erythromycin, imipenem, quinolones and aminoglycosides [1, 23] . After the discontinuation of the offending medication, the fever resolves usually within 72 h but when a rash is present it persists for days or weeks.",

VAP occurs in 25 % of mechanically ventilated patients presenting with leukocytosis, purulent tracheal secretions and new or worsening infiltrates on the chest roentgenogram, but it is difficult to differentiate from other conditions characterized by the same symptoms and signs [29] . The most aggressive diagnostic approach for VAP includes bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), semiquantitative mini-BAL and protected specimen brush performance. However, with prior antibiotic therapy these techniques are considered of limited diagnostic value [30] . The intensivist frequently has to differentiate pneumonia from ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and LVF (left ventricular failure) because of the same pattern of pulmonary infiltrates.

In patients with progressive signs of severe sepsis and in all neutropenic patients with fever, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy should be started immediately after cultures have been obtained. In patients with no clinically obvious signs of infection all the central lines (placed > 48 h) and the nasal tubes should be removed and cultured (with semiquantitative or quantitative cultures), while in the case of diarrhea, stool cultures for WBC count and toxin against C. difficile should be performed. CT scanning of the abdomen is indicated in patients with abdominal sepsis or with signs of abdominal infection (tenderness, distension, etc.). If fever persists after 48 h despite empiric antibiotic treatment and without the cause or the source of the infection being identified, the patient must be reevaluated for risk factors associated with fungal infections (antifungal treatment is indicated) and with additional diagnostic tests being performed including venography, blood cultures for eosinophils (drug fever) and abdominal imaging.",

External cooling methods include hypothermia blanket placement, the use of which, however, is characterized by certain side effects including large temperature fluctuations, rebound hyperthermia, increased hypermetabolism and elevated oxygen consumption leading to increased epinephrine and norepinephrine levels [40] .",
