The corollary assertion of this principle is that, when potentially serious risks arise, measures must be taken to minimize that risk. It could therefore be argued that the PI of blood products represents the quintessence of the precautionary principle: almost all potential for transfusion-transmissible disease is eradicated often before the responsible agent is even recognized, let alone conclusively established as a risk to the health of the recipient.",

            "text": "Prevention of transfusion-transmitted infections has traditionally been accomplished by testing donors for infectious disease markers. This approach has certainly achieved some great successes in reducing the risk of blood transfusion. The risk of transfusion-acquired hepatitis, for example, has been reduced from nearly 30% to near zero through the combination of more restrictive donor selection and increasingly sensitive screening assays.2 This reduction in risk, however, occurred over a period of decades, and during the interim, countless transfusion recipients were harmed. Hepatitis B virus, for example, was first recognized as a transfusion risk in 1940, but it was only in 1970 that blood donors could be effectively screened with the first-generation assays for the historical Australia antigen, now known as the hepatitis B surface antigen. This assay was quickly refined and, in combination with the adoption of an all-volunteer donor system, reduced the overall risk of transfusion-acquired HBV to less than 1%. Nevertheless, transfusion-acquired hepatitis of all causes continued to occur at an incidence of approximately 10% throughout the 1970s, primarily because of a disease identified syndromically in 1975 as non-A/non-B hepatitis. The adoption of surrogate assays for this disease (eg, elevated donor alanine aminotransferase levels), the exclusion of donors for behavioral risk factors, and the decreased volume of blood transfused all combined to decrease the incidence of transfusion-acquired hepatitis to around 4% by 1989. It was only with the introduction of a specific serologic assay in 1990 for what was then recognized as HCV that the incidence of transfusion-associated hepatitis fell to less than 0.5%. By that point, however, much damage had already been done. If one assumes that 3 million patients are transfused per year in the United States, then it follows that some 4.8 million people acquired transfusion-acquired hepatitis between 1970 and 1990. Most of these cases were HCV, a disease that carries an 80% risk of chronicity and a 20% risk of cirrhosis and which is now the leading etiologic cause of liver transplantation in North America.",

Thus, whereas it took 30 years to introduce screening for HBV and 15 years for HCV, it was only 3 years between the recognition of HIV and the development of a donor screening test, and for WNV, the interval was only 1 year. Yet, there continue to be exceptions to this trend: donor testing for Chagas disease was first recommended in 2002 by the Blood Products Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug Administration but is only being implemented 5 years later. Perhaps more importantly, there is often an earlier period of delay, during which a disease is not appreciated as posing a risk to recipients of blood transfusion or, indeed, to human health in general. The harm caused by such diseases has been called a \u201cfixed and inevitable property of transfusion practice.\u201d3\n",

Many are zoonotic in origin, their transition into significant human pathogens the result of primate viruses entering the food supply in Africa (eg, HIV) or a shifting geographic relationship between disease vectors and humans who then serve as incidental hosts (eg, WNV). Having largely safeguarded the blood supply against HIV and transfusion-transmitted hepatitis, the transfusion medicine community is confronted with an ever-growing list of new adversaries: malaria, dengue, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, borreliosis, human herpes virus 8, and Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease), to name just a few. Each of these is known to be pathogenic and to be transmissible by blood transfusion. Indeed, dengue fever may well emerge as the next true threat to the blood supply: it already causes approximately 100 million cases and 25 000 deaths around the world each year. Most cases of dengue fever are asymptomatic, with a median viremia of 5 days, and both the virus and its mosquito vector are expanding in global distribution.4 On the other hand, the blood industry may initiate screening tests for dengue only to find itself confronted with a completely unanticipated threat from a different pathogen. The dilemma we face, therefore, is whether to wait and see which pathogens emerge as serious risks to the blood supply before taking action (in which case we inevitably consign thousands and perhaps millions of patients to infectious harm during the interim) or simply start testing donors for all potentially transmissible pathogens (which would be prohibitively expensive).",

Transfusion-transmitted WNV, for example, infected 23 people in the United States, including 16 with neurologic disease, before the implementation of a donor screening assay in 2003.5 An estimated 3200 other patients experienced subclinical disease. None of these infections, however, occurred via fractionated plasma products, because of the prior implementation of a solvent/detergent (SD) method of PI by the plasma fractionation industry. It is sobering to contemplate how much harm could have been avoided had this additional safety measure been implemented in the early 1980s, when the hemophilia community was just beginning to be ravaged by HIV and HCV. Although SD treatment is not applicable to cellular blood products, such as RBCs and platelet concentrates, other processes that target nucleic acids (eg, amotosalen or riboflavin) are now available. In addition to blocking transmission of both known and unknown pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, spirochetes, and protozoa, PI may also prevent transfusion-associated graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) by disabling donor lymphocytes.",

Although PI invariably involves the addition of novel chemical substances to blood products, these substances are either benign (eg, riboflavin) or are subsequently removed, with residual levels far below established toxicity thresholds (eg, amotosalen [S-59]\u2013treated platelets; the toxicity of residual S-303 [amustaline] in treated RBCs requires further investigation). The reduction in product yield that PI necessitates is generally modest (10%-20%) and consistent with other accepted product modifications such as cell washing or leukoreduction. The additional costs of PI are considerable, but so are the potential savings that may be subsequently realized via elimination of existing donor screening assays (eg, Chagas disease), product testing (eg, bacterial testing of platelets), and product modification (ie, irradiation). Future costs from new screening assays could also be avoided, as could the growing cost from the otherwise inexorable progression from mini-pool to single-unit nucleic acid testing (NAT). Finally, the additional layer of safety offered by PI might allow blood collection agencies to loosen donor exclusion criteria (eg, geographic exclusions for malaria) and thereby increase the size of the available blood supply.",

Accomplishing this in a reasonable period will require additional governmental funding, both to improve existing technologies and to develop new processes, particularly with regard to PI of RBCs. However, we must not make the perfect the enemy of the good. Until this idealized multicomponent system is a reality, existing pathogen reduction technologies should be implemented for platelets and transfusable plasma, an approach already undertaken in many parts of Europe. Taking this next step in North America will require an investment of resources and political willpower and, perhaps most importantly, a change in our collective mindset regarding the notion of acceptable risk.",

Deoxyribonucleic acid is damaged by dye intercalation with free radical roles in strand cross-linking, guanosine oxidation, and indirect depurination.8 Like SD, the application of MB is restricted to plasma and is also limited in its PI abilities. However, the basis for these limitations is different. Red blood cell hemolysis can occur from the effect of reactive MB singlets on lipid and protein components of membranes. On the other hand, the capsids of nonenveloped viruses, and the membranes of bacteria, protozoa, or the infected leukocytes that persist after plasma freeze-thaw, may resist not only these perturbations but MB penetration itself. An elimination micropore filter is thus used to remove residual leukocytes alongside the dye and its photoderivatives.",

A modern toxicology test battery begins with pharmacokinetic studies and is followed by assessment of single-dose toxicity, repeated-dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. To detect all potential hazards, the dosages selected for study should range to high enough to induce generalized toxicity syndromes in test animals, such as weight loss and decreased food consumption. The combined results of these toxicity studies provides a comprehensive hazard assessment, which comprises all potential adverse effects at maximal tolerated doses and the dose-response relationship for these toxic effects. The comprehensive risk assessment is in turn weighed against an exposure assessment, which involves assumptions regarding the typical dose of the substance, the frequency with which it will be administered, and the expected duration of treatment. Ideally, the maximum safe dose determined by animal studies should have a 1000-fold safety margin: a 10-fold margin to account for extrapolation from animal to human physiology, another 10-fold margin to account for physiologic variation in humans, and another 10-fold margin again to account for variability in the detection of all toxicology end points.",

These doses are 150 000 and 30 000 times higher, respectively, than what would be delivered in a typical dose of amotosalen-inactivated blood products. For other toxicities, however, the safety margin is below 1000. Reproductive toxicity (determined by histologic rather than functional assessment), for example, was demonstrated at a threshold of 0.35 mg/kg, or 350 times the expected clinical exposure.16 The reproductive risk of PEN110 has also been found to have an appropriate safety margin.18 It should be borne in mind that many widely used medications, such as acetaminophen, have safety margins of only 100-fold. It should also be noted that all PI substances are water soluble and rapidly excreted, and therefore, the trace amounts infused in treated blood products will not bioaccumulate.

In a study of 28 animals receiving 3 infusions of PEN110 per week for 26 weeks, by contrast, the dose had to exceed 4.5 mg/kg before tumor induction exceeded what was observed in the control arm. In a 70-kg patient, this dose would be equivalent to receiving nearly 40 000 U of PEN110-treated RBCs per week. The carcinogenicity of a more typical human exposure can therefore only be calculated by extrapolating backwards from the dose-response curve observed in experimental studies, and unsurprisingly, the degree of added risk is very small. Even if one were to base risk assessment on the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI), treating the entire US blood supply (approximately 14 million RBCs per year) with PEN110 would be expected to result in only 1 extra malignancy every 70 years.",

In the p53+/\u2212 model, however, the ability to expose the animals on a regular basis over a 6-month period combined with the increased susceptibility of the mice to carcinogenesis allows for a more rigorous assessment of carcinogenic risk.

The distribution of SD plasma in the United States by the American Red Cross in the late 1990s was followed by several postmarketing reports of thrombosis, bleeding secondary to hyperfibrinolysis, and death, particularly in patients undergoing liver transplantation,27, 28 and it was partly on the basis of these reports that SD plasma was effectively withdrawn from the market in the United States in 2002. These adverse events were attributed to a loss of protein S and antiplasmin that occurred during SD treatment of plasma. Notably, the SD plasma product provided in Europe, which is made using a somewhat different process, does not appear to have been associated with the same adverse events. Although there have been cases of possible thrombotic events in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) receiving European-manufactured SD plasma,29 it is not clear whether SD plasma was the causative factor. Perhaps more importantly, a study focusing on patients undergoing liver transplantation, an ostensibly higher risk population, failed to document any excessive bleeding with the use of European-manufactured SD plasma.30, 31 Other studies have shown that the SD plasma products manufactured in Europe have reduced loss of protein S and antiplasmin in comparison with the US product.32, 33 It has also been suggested that the risk from US-manufactured SD plasma was itself exaggerated.34\n",

The risk of transmission is further exacerbated by the fact that SD plasma batches are made from pools of up to 2500 individual donations; in the United States, 37 lots of SD plasma were voluntarily recalled because of parvovirus B19 contamination, although none of these cases involved clinical disease. In one phase 4 study, 18 of 77 volunteers seroconverted against parvovirus B19 after infusion of SD plasma, and it was found that all implicated lots had high levels of viremia (>107 GEq/L). Individual plasma donations in SD plasma batches are now checked for parvovirus B19 and HAV using NAT , with European Union regulations requiring that all lots with B19 viremia exceeding a considerably lower threshold of 104 GEq/L be discarded (approximately 1 in 800 lots will exceed this threshold for parvovirus B19). It should be noted in passing that, although SD treatment is less effective than other PI processes against bacteria or other cellular organisms, these pathogens are already eliminated in all plasma products via the physical processing that clears most cellular components and the freeze-thaw cycle that destroys whatever remains.

For transfusion-transmissible diseases such as vCJD, in which the pathogenic agent can neither be tested for nor demonstrably eliminated by available PI technologies, the high number of donor exposures per transfusion from any pooled product is especially worrying. On the other hand, pooling also greatly dilutes the infectious load present in any single donation, possibly to levels below the minimal infectious dose, particularly if the pool also contains a neutralizing antibody. It is notable that with more than 6 million doses of SD plasma transfused worldwide, there has not been a single report of either transfusion-transmissible vCJD or transfusion-related acute lung injury (ALI) (TRALI) with this product. In the case of TRALI, the effect of pooling has been demonstrated to reduce the concentration of donor antileukocyte antibodies, thought to contribute to TRALI, to below the limits of detection. Pooling of plasma from donors of varying ABO groups, when performed in proper proportions, also allows for the production of universally ABO-compatible plasma. Additional precautionary steps available to blood collection agencies include the importation of plasma from North America (to avoid vCJD risks) and use of plasma from male donors (to avoid donations with a higher risk of containing antileukocyte antibodies.) The United Kingdom has recently adopted imported SD plasma as its PI plasma product of choice for patients with TTP despite the aversion toward the use of pooled products in the United Kingdom due to vCJD concerns.",

Moreover, more recent studies comparing MB plasma and FFP in patients with TTP suggested that MB plasma may actually be less effective.38, 39, 40 It is notable that the introduction of MB plasma in the Catalonia region of Spain in 1997 was followed by a dramatic increase in the ratio of plasma to RBC transfusions and was accompanied by growing demand for fibrinogen in the form of cryoprecipitate.41 The implication of this observation is that MB plasma has reduced hemostatic quality, perhaps due to the 20% loss of fibrinogen that is observed after MB treatment of native plasma.42 Experience elsewhere shows little difference between the use of FFP and MB plasma,43 and the extensive experience with MB plasma in Europe would tend to support this observation. Although all licensed PI plasma products have approximately 20% to 30% less coagulation factor VIII than native plasma, this is unlikely to be clinically significant except in patients with congenital factor VIII deficiency.",

After these studies are completed, platelet transfusion studies in thrombocytopenic patients are conducted to determine platelet viability by assessing posttransfusion platelet increments, corrected count increments, and days to next transfusion. In vivo hemostatic function of transfused platelets given to thrombocytopenic patients can be evaluated by bleeding time measurements correlated with pre- and posttransfusion platelet counts, direct visual and/or diagnostic assessments of bleeding within multiple organ systems, and red cell transfusion requirements.",

In a study by Goodrich et al,51 autologous platelets were collected from 18 healthy volunteers by apheresis.

The PI procedure used the same dose of riboflavin (50 \u03bcmol/L) with varying doses of UV-A exposure (7.2 J/mL in 5 healthy volunteers and 12.4 J/mL in 6 healthy volunteers). At the end of storage, platelets were labeled with 111indium and reinfused. Pathogen inactivation platelets had significantly lower percentages of recovery and shorter survivals than similarly stored conventional platelets at both UV-A doses (P < .05 for all measurements). Moreover, increasing the UV-A dose produced logarithmic decreases in both post-transfusion platelet recoveries and survivals. These results are in keeping with a single-blind, crossover 5-day platelet storage study by AuBuchon et al.52\n111Indium-radiolabeled autologous platelet recoveries and survivals were statistically significantly lower for all measurements (P < .05) in volunteers who received platelets treated with riboflavin and 6.2 J/mL UV-A vs conventional platelets (platelet recoveries were 50% \u00b1 19% vs 67% \u00b1 13%, and survivals were 4.3 \u00b1 1.1 vs 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 days, respectively).

For the incidence of World Health Organization grade 3 or 4 bleeding, again, no difference was observed between the study arms (4.1% for patients in the treated arm vs 6.1% for patients in the conventional arm). The number of red cell transfusions given in both arms was the same (5.5 vs 5.0, respectively). On the other hand, posttransfusion platelet counts (37 000/\u03bcL vs 50 000/\u03bcL), platelet increments (21 000/\u03bcL vs 34 000/\u03bcL), and corrected count increments (11 000/\u03bcL vs 16 000/\u03bcL) at 1 and 24 hours posttransfusion were significantly lower in the treated vs the conventional arm (1-hour data are provided, P < .001 for all values at both 1 and 24 hours posttransfusion). These differences in posttransfusion platelet responses, in part, could be explained by the fact that patients in the treated arm received a slightly lower mean platelet mean dose of 3.7 \u00d7 1011 vs 4.0 \u00d7 1011 platelets per transfusion (P < .001). Patients in the treated arm also had shorter mean intervals between transfusions (1.9 vs 2.4 days, respectively; P < .001) and thus received 26% more platelet transfusions per patient (8.4 vs 6.2, respectively; P < .001).",

The absolute criteria are arbitrary but adequate and appropriate. The relative criteria provide interesting information but are of very limited utility.

Double-label technique provides improved accuracy, particularly at lower recoveries, whereas SLR is simpler and quicker for subjects and researchers, is associated with less radiation exposure, and is less expensive.

Currently, the FDA requires RBC survival studies only for major alterations in blood systems. Because PI technology represents a major alteration, RBC survival studies may be necessary. Pathogen inactivation agents are able to affect biologic systems, so it is not surprising that the RBC PI systems appear to have reduced viability. For example, inactine resulted in RBC recoveries not different from control but an acceleration of clearance from circulation beyond 24 hours by approximately one third.61 The original S-303 treatment process resulted in a slight decrease in recovery vs control but an unchanged survival.62 However, both of these processes resulted in generation of antibodies directed at moieties deposited on the RBC membrane through chemical interaction.63 This led to the abandonment of inactine and a revision of S-30364 process that yields RBCs nonreactive to antiacridine antibodies.

This is not unexpected given that human sera contain an amazing variety of antibodies to chemicals,67 the presence of some of which are probably due to environmental exposure to these chemicals (eg, polyethylene glycol is present in a wide variety of foods and cosmetics); thus, the antibodies can be found in healthy donors and patients. Other antibodies are present because of inadvertent immunization with the chemical used in the PI process. This would involve the same mechanisms occurring in drug-induced immune reactions, that is, the antibody could be directed against the chemical/drug itself (eg, penicillin-induced serology) or to a combination of the chemical and the RBC membrane. Two further possibilities are that (1) the chemical/drug may change the RBC membrane, creating a new antigen (neoantigen); or (2) the changed RBC membrane may adsorb proteins nonimmunologically, leading to a positive antiglobulin test (in vitro and possibly in vivo). All of these mechanisms have been observed after PI processes, although the evidence for antibodies to neoantigens is slim. The finding of antibodies due to this phenomena (eg, naturally occurring antibodies to chemicals, drug-induced antibodies, or immune response to chemicals used in PI) does not necessarily mean that decreased RBC survival will occur.

It will be difficult, if not impossible, to predict these serologic problems using animal models. In addition, the immune responses to the chemicals may only occur in a few patients. Even if companies fulfill all FDA requirements, crossmatching problems may still occur in the future, but the incidence may not be any higher than the incidence of alloantibodies to RBC antigens, and the same decision-making approaches can be used to sort out these issues. As with the RBC blood group antibodies, the most important data will be to evaluate RBC survival of the transfused RBCs. To determine immune RBC destruction, the 24-hour recovery will not suffice; RBC survival studies will also be necessary.",

In the Quebec experience, 30% of hemolytic reactions were due to ABO incompatibility with the balance due to alloimmune or autoimmune hemolysis. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions commonly result from antibodies that were previously identified but which are no longer reactive in the pretransfusion specimen. Preventing such reactions depends upon retrieval of data from patient blood bank records. Because patients receive health care at multiple hospitals, sharing data regarding prior sensitization to blood groups between hospitals would be expected to reduce the rate of hemolytic reactions. This strategy was put to the test in Quebec, where all hospital blood banks were given access to a common database of patient records during the period from 2003 to 2005. Importantly, the incidence of both acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions significantly decreased after implementation of this online interhospital database. Reactions were cut by more than 50% at a cost of approximately $6 per RBC (or $3 per component) transfused (P. Robillard, personal communication, 2007). Centralized data registries such as this could also store data obtained from high-throughput gene chip technologies applied to donor and recipient antigen typing.76 Such prospective matching may further decrease hemolytic events by reducing rates of alloimmunization to RBC antigens.",

Guidance documents on design and interpretation of such studies can be found on the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research web site.78 A caveat is that these tests model toxicity in a healthy organism but may not predict toxicity in a stressed or diseased organism. Because transfusion products will be infused into patients who have significant underlying disease, there is potential for a different toxicity profile. In addition to the mentioned toxicity studies, the PR processes should also be evaluated in models that mimic the physiologic stresses induced by various clinical situations. One example would be an animal model of platelet-mediated organ toxicity, the ALI murine model.79 In this model, platelets mediate the pathophysiology of acid- or septicemia-induced ALI by anchoring neutrophils to lung endothelial cells. Platelet P-selectin mediates neutrophil accumulation in the lung, with the hypothesis being that platelets expressing more P-selectin could support more neutrophil accumulation in lungs and exacerbate ALI symptoms. A hypothetical clinical scenario that reflects this mechanism could apply to an immunosuppressed thrombocytopenic patient who develops sepsis and mild ALI. Some PI-treated platelets have higher P-selectin expression than control platelets, and in this setting, infusion of PI-treated platelets could exacerbate the ALI symptoms. Examples of other such models that implicate platelets in pathophysiology of disease include mouse models of allergic pneumonitis80 and ischemia-reperfusion models.81 After preclinical trials, clinical trials should monitor all adverse events to identify unexpected toxicities and evaluate immune response for antibody development.

A study to detect an adverse event with a frequency of 1 in 75 000 would be unlikely because it would require 225 000 participants.83 Nevertheless, justification for requesting an in-depth safety evaluation of PI products in clinical studies revolves around the following arguments. The benefit derived from the PI process is relatively small because of a safe blood supply, and any adverse event associated with the treated transfusion product would need to be of very low frequency to be acceptable. Available data indicate that PI platelets are activated with increased P-selectin expression and damaged with decreased recovery and survival.

In addition, legally binding directives 93/42/EC and 98/79/EC define standards for medical devices such as blood collection bags and in vitro diagnostics such as screening tests. Moreover, each nation may have its own, sometimes more stringent, regulations of the transfusion system.

Production and distribution of blood components, on the other hand, are regulated by the German Drug Law. Blood banks are required to apply to the regional authorities for a manufacturing license.

Wide variations in estimates of preintervention risk existed, most likely as a result of differences in surveillance intensity. The same caveats applied to postintervention risk estimates, although countries with active hemovigilance systems were better able to make this assessment because of their enhanced surveillance mechanisms and more robust adverse event definitions.

However, given the context of blood safety expectations and robust capabilities of PI, traditional cost-effectiveness thresholds may not be relevant. These thresholds typically apply to specific interventions as opposed to interventions with broad-spectrum capability. Furthermore the precedent set in blood safety is that interventions that cost well over $1 million per QALY are candidates for adoption.",

An analysis conducted for the US setting predated current bacterial culture. Results were reported for 4 different patient groups (pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia, hip arthroplasty, coronary artery bypass grafts, and adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and with and without bacterial culture. Depending on the patient population, baseline results ranged from US $4.8 million to $23.0 million per QALY with bacterial culture and US $1.3 million to $4.5 million per QALY without bacterial culture for AP platelets.95 For RD platelets, the profile improved to US $1.0 million to $6.0 million per QALY with bacterial culture and US $460 000 to $1.8 million per QALY without bacterial culture. This difference was mainly attributed to higher risk of bacterial contamination in RD vs AP platelets. In a similar analysis from Japan with the same patient populations, results ranged from \u00a599 million to \u00a5433 million per QALY (US $818 000-$3.6 million per QALY) without bacterial culture for AP platelets.96 Three studies from Europe have generated results with the same order of magnitude. Patient populations were different, reflecting those of health care institutions within each country. One study from the Netherlands found the cost effectiveness to be \u20ac2.8 million per QALY (US $3.6 million per QALY) with bacterial culture and \u20ac382 000 per QALY (US $497 000 per QALY) without bacterial culture in RD platelets for the average recipient.97 Another study from the Netherlands reported results of \u20ac261 000 to \u20ac679 000 per life year gained (US $339 000-$889 000 per life year gained) for 3 different patient populations.98 A study from Belgium reported results ranging between \u20ac195 000 and \u20ac3.5 million per QALY (US $255 000-$4.6 million per QALY) for RD platelet transfusion to 9 patient populations.99 In all of these studies, the best cost-effectiveness profile was evident for the pediatric population. Results were most sensitive to the risk of sepsis, death attributable to sepsis, and the age and underlying medical conditions of the transfused population. Results were not sensitive to viral infections, except in scenario analyses that included significant risks of clinically important emerging unknown viruses.

Should newer PI technologies be adopted, the cost of blood components will increase.

This theoretically may be minimized through the use of dyes such as MB and dimethylene blue, which bind strongly to nucleic acids. This provides a basis for specificity because pathogens, unlike RBCs, contain genomic nucleic acid. Hemolysis upon illumination with these compounds may occur by several mechanisms: (1) freely floating dye near RBCs produces singlet oxygen when illuminated, which results in RBC damage; (2) many nucleic acid binding dyes also bind to the RBC membrane, resulting in photo-induced hemolysis.

However, the structure of some sensitizers permits separated aromatic ring systems to rotate about adjoining covalent linkages of partial single-bond character when they are not rigidly bound to substrate. This rotation permits the energy from absorbed light to be dissipated as heat through bond rotation. However, once these dyes are intercalated into nucleic acids, they become rigid photosensitizers. The discovery of flexible dyes has allowed the development of RBC cell inactivation systems that are more specific for pathogens and that do not cause excessive RBC cell damage. The first example of a flexible photosensitizer used for RBC cell decontamination was a nucleic acid staining dye, thiopyrylium (TP). Because TP bound to RBCs cells in addition to nucleic acids, a second substance, dipyridamole, a commonly used vasodilator drug, and also an antioxidant, may be added to inhibit binding and photodamage to RBC membranes. Thiopyrylium phototreatment of RBC suspensions containing 200 \u03bcmol/L dipyridamole with 1.1 J/cm2 of red light resulted in robust inactivation of a number of intracellular and extracellular viruses as well as bacteria and parasites.64, 102 After storage for 42 days, the RBCs exhibited acceptable levels of hemolysis, morphology scores, extracellular pH, ATP, glucose use rates, and lactate production. However, treated samples exhibited substantially increased potassium efflux compared with controls, and day 42 ATP levels were significantly different from controls.64 Autologous infusion of fresh TP-phototreated canine RBCs cells resulted in comparable 24-hour recovery and survival as untreated fresh canine RBCs.103\n",

There was optimism, however, that with refinement, PI technologies could eventually have a major impact on the prevention of transfusion-transmissible infections in less financially capable nations. This was seen as a significant impetus to the continued need for the development of PI technology. An additional point made was that it was likely not feasible to continue to introduce additional tests for every emerging pathogen. The finite resources available to ensure transfusion safety precluded such an approach because the costs of introducing additional tests for emerging pathogens would be considerable.

Ideally, a universal approach to implementation of PI should be pursued; however, with the limitations of currently proposed PI technology, a universal approach to PI of all blood components would probably not be possible at this time. For example, obstacles to the PI of RBCs remain substantial. Under these circumstances, implementation of PI technology would likely result in 2 levels of safety for the different blood components, and the attendant needs to continue to perform microbiological screening of RBC components. If universal implementation of PI for all blood components were not possible, the ethical considerations of selective implementation of PI technology would have to be addressed, including issues relating to varying the levels of the safety of blood products and the need for explicit informed consent by the patient receiving the PI products. For example, would it be appropriate to offer PI-treated products to the pediatric population exclusively, similar to the approach taken in the United Kingdom with the transfusion of MB-treated plasma to persons younger than 16 years? Similar concerns could arise during the crossover from the existing inventory to a PI inventory. Moreover, if significant differences were known to exist between PI and non-PI products, this could become an important element of informed consent for transfusion.

There was considerable skepticism as to whether cost savings would actually be realized, because regulatory constraints would likely not permit the discontinuation of existing donor screening practices. It was considered unlikely that the discontinuation of HIV, HCV, or HBV testing would be acceptable based on political considerations and other societal pressures. It would thus take many years for PI technology to be validated to allow discontinuation of various microbiological screening testing. Similar to the situation with CMV serologic testing after implementation of universal leukoreduction, it was considered unlikely that physicians would accept the discontinuation of established screening practices, including the irradiation of blood products for transplant patients, despite the apparent likely effectiveness of PI in the prevention of GVHD. It was pointed out that for some countries, such as Canada, which provides a universally leukoreduced product and in addition performs CMV serologic testing for specific indications, there would likely be no benefit to PI in reduction of CMV testing.

For example, the Blood Products Advisory Committee in the United States recommended discontinuation of syphilis testing of the blood supply many years ago, yet this test continues to be performed on all blood donations in the United States. It was further suggested that the requirements for the testing of a new technology have become so detailed as to be counterproductive to the rational assessment of new approaches to transfusion safety. It was recommended that the regulators clearly define what data might be required for licensure of a new technology. In the past, manufacturers were required to develop the concept and move it through the regulatory process to bring new technology to the market. This was felt to be a time-consuming and laborious approach, which has become cost prohibitive based on the sophistication of newer technologies under development. It was felt that the role of blood operators in facilitating this process must also be clarified and that there should be a cooperative effort between the innovator of new technology, the regulator, and the blood operator before the implementation of new technologies.",
