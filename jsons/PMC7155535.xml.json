These cones extend from the growth plates and are surrounded by a thin osseous rim at the time of hatching. They gradually become separated from the growth plate, surviving as a central cartilaginous core until becoming fully remodelled into trabecular bone 6\u20138 weeks after hatching.

Histologic aortic lesions include fragmentation and disruption of the elastic laminae, cystic extracellular spaces, and an accumulation of what have been interpreted to be strongly sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides based on staining with Alcian blue and periodic acid Schiff (PAS). Copper deficiency is suspected based both on the character of the aortic lesions and the findings of low liver copper levels in a number of affected birds. A copper-dependent enzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin fibres that provides strength to the vascular wall. Liver copper levels in affected birds are frequently below 3.5 ppm, in comparison to above 5 ppm in unaffected birds.",

Infection with a variety of viral strains including those of both high (H5 and H7; HPAI) and low pathogenicity occur frequently in farmed ostriches in South Africa (Abolnik et al., 2016). Outbreaks are thought to result from exposure to wild birds. Clinical signs and pathology associated with AIV in ostriches in natural outbreaks and with experimental infection are variable. Mortality can be up to 100% and is dependent on age, virus strain, and secondary infections (Allwright, 1996, Capua et al., 2000, Cooper et al., 2007). Chicks and juvenile birds are more susceptible to infection and develop more significant clinical disease than adults, who frequently appear unaffected. Clinical signs include anorexia, depression, and poor growth rates as well as green discoloration of the urine (biliverdinuria), swelling of the throat and neck, ocular discharge and sneezing and evidence of respiratory difficulty. Gross necropsy findings are nonspecific and can include serous atrophy of fat and muscle atrophy; luminal bile and bile staining of the upper gastrointestinal tract; hepatic bile stasis; congestion and mottling of the liver, spleen, kidneys, trachea and lungs; epicardial hemorrhages; and intestinal congestion to severe hemorrhagic enteritis. Histologic lesions also vary and include multifocal to diffuse necrosis of liver, spleen, and kidneys with a heterophilic response; pancreatic hemorrhage and necrosis with mononuclear cell inflammation; fibrinoid arteriolar necrosis and inflammation, particularly in spleen and brain; interstitial pneumonia; mild to marked air sacculitis; multifocal malacia and neuronophagia in the brain; and necrosis and hemorrhage in the intestine, particularly in the duodenum. Both gross and histologic lesions are affected by the presence of secondary infections, which have been prevalent in several reports. Infection with low pathogenic avian influenza viruses results in primarily a mild respiratory disease, with a reduction in egg production (Cooper et al., 2007).",

Outbreaks are frequent in young chicks (e.g., brooder pneumonia). Clinical signs and gross and pathologic lesions are similar to those in any avian species and include pale gray to yellow nodules and plaques in the lungs and air sacs (Fig. 26.13\n). Histopathologic lesions are typical for avian aspergillosis, with central areas of necrosis that contain parallel-walled, dichotomously branching, fungal hyphae and conidia (at air interfaces) and are surrounded by heterophilic and granulomatous inflammation with multinucleate giant cells and (in chronic lesions) an outer layer of fibroblasts or granulation tissue. Fungal elements are often easily identified with routine hematoxylin and eosin staining; silver or PAS stains highlight the organisms. Aspergillus\nspp. have also been reported as the cause of dermatitis in ostriches. Lesions can be localized or extensive (Kuttin and Perelman, 1996). Regardless of site, fungal culture is confirmatory and PCR can be used for additional characterization and differentiation of species. Predisposing factors to infection include contamination of eggs and hatcheries, overwhelming exposure to fungal spores through contaminated feed and bedding, and immunosuppression; high humidity and/or poor hygiene were associated husbandry conditions in cutaneous aspergillosis.\n",

One species, Eimeria kiwi is present in the intestinal epithelium. An unusual feature of infection is the presence of large macromeronts (Morgan et al., 2012) (Fig. 26.15\n). Other identified species include E. parairii (suspected to play a role in the development of colorectal polyps), E. mantelli (has been identified in feces but has not yet been associated with clinical disease), and E. apteryxii (causes renal coccidiosis in the North Island brown kiwi, rowi, and tokoeka) (Morgan et al., 2012, Morgan et al., 2017, Thompson and Wright, 1978). Additionally, asexual stages of unknown coccidial species have been found in the liver, spleen, lung, and pancreas. Periodic acid Schiff staining of kidney to enhance parasite recognition is recommended as part of routine histopathologic examination (Morgan et al., 2013). Eimeriosis has also been described in red-winged tinamous. Infection with the causative agent, E. rhynchoti, caused apathy and maldigested, fetid, pasty feces as well as duodenal hemorrhage and thickening (Freitas et al., 2006, Marques et al., 2012).

The product markets did not; however, expand at the same rate as the breeding programs and the heyday of the North American ratite industry ended within a decade or so. A scan through the more recent literature reveals an increase in publications concerning diseases of ratites emerging from South America and Asia.
