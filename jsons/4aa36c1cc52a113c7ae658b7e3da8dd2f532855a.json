This study supported the question. Darr Darr (2000) 142 (LOE 4) provided a descriptive case study of an alternative ACLS course format that included multiple preparatory options including attending optional lectures, viewing lectures on video tape, using an interactive computer-assisted instruction program, viewing a series of ACLS core case videos, and participating in teaching labs. This study was small (n=17) and did not evaluate learning outcomes; therefore it was classified as \"poor\" in its ability to address the question. The primary intent of the study was to evaluate learner attitudes on this flexible format as an optimal learning format. Most comments and survey responses reported learners favored this course format. Instructor to student face-to-face time was dramatically decreased and costs for this course format were 42% lower than the traditional ACLS course.",

However, Kim Kim (2002) 395 found that traditional textbook preparation was more effective than computer assisted learning in preparing for a program based on ACLS-like material. Importantly, Kim stated that textbook studying may be more effective for courses of short duration. Denton Denton (2004) 329 and Woodworth Woodworth (2005) 77 examined pretests as a means of improving learner outcome. Denton cited the use of a pretest as a means of identifying learners at risk of poor performance. Woodworth cited pretests as a means of attention-getting prior to presentation of course content. Rizzolo Rizzolo (2002) 352 compared learners' usage patterns of Internet-based preparatory material against learner outcomes. Interestingly, he found 10 learners who used the resource the most, scored below the mean.",

Conversely, course information not included in the objectives may be ignored by the learner, even when that information may be considered important by the instructor. -There was very little difference between general learning objectives (Tyler style) and specific learning objectives (Mager style) on learner outcomes. -Training learners in the use of learning objectives does not impact learner outcomes. However, training instructors in the use of learning objectives does impact learner outcomes. -Produce a generally positive effect on learner outcomes. Overviews --Allow emphasis of key material in a condensed format -Overviews need not be all at once; for processes that require steps, overviews prior to each step may be more effective.",

Furthermore, the period of instruction should be relatively short in duration and posses a rather loose structure. Students should probably have a reasonable acquaintance with the topic prior to its formal presentation, and they might typically be of above average in intelligence. If the effectiveness of the instruction is to be assessed, pretest may also be useful (although, of course, one has to be aware of their instructional implications. 2. Behavioral objectives, on the other hand, might best be used in situations in which students should be precisely informed of what it is they are to accomplish. They appear to be most suitable when they are used to preface quite long periods of instruction, which also might typically possess a dominant overall structure. Students should probably be within the middleability range, and quite possibly of an independent frame of mind. 3. Overviews might best be reserved for those learning situations in which students need to be prepared for the learning task ahead. The task might typically possess little or no structure, yet students would benefit from being made familiar with the central arguments to be expounded. Overviews might also be best used when factual information is going to be presented to lowerability students, or when concepts are principles are going to be presented to students of higher ability. 4. Advance organizers would seem to be best reserved for situations requiring some sort of conceptual framework that students can subsequently use to help clarify the task ahead. The subject material should possess a dominant structure that can be readily integrated with the existing knowledge already possessed by the students. Learning tasks should be relatively short in duration. Finally, it is probably best if the students involved -whether adult or children -are of above average ability, maturity, and sophistication.
