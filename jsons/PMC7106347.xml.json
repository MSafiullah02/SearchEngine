One study found that 25% of ED visits during peak periods are for fever and respiratory infection symptoms [9]. Peak influenza circulation is associated with reduced ED throughput efficiency, increased ED length of stay (LOS), and a greater proportion of patients who depart before seeing a physician [10]. Additionally, influenza patients\u2019 median LOS is five times greater than other ambulatory ED patients [11]. Most EDs lack space to accommodate such increases and standard operating procedures require patients to remain in crowded waiting rooms until patient rooms become available. Such space limitations and overcrowding facilitate nosocomial infections [12,13].",

Despite numerous attempts, syndromic formulas for distinguishing influenza from other respiratory illnesses lack the sensitivity required to inform clinical decisions regarding patient care and isolation [[14], [15], [16], [17]]. The gold standard for viral testing is laboratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Despite high sensitivities and specificities, test turnaround times (TAT) are too long to facilitate clinical decision-making. Recent technological advancements in point-of-care (POC) testing, such as rapid antigen testing, have provided test results in less than 20 min yet exhibit low sensitivity [[18], [19], [20], [21]].",

Our team used one system, located in the ED, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the duration of the study. Results were available in approximately 20 min. Coordinators also collected patient information including demographics, clinical history of current illness, and relevant past medical history using a standardized REDCap data form hosted at the Stanford Center for Clinical Informatics [32]. Physicians were blinded to POC-PCR results. After triage, patients were placed in one of three room types - private, cohort, or shared \u2013 a decision based on current room availability and attending physician\u2019s discretion. A cohort room, defined as a room in which all patients have respiratory symptoms, is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a method of limiting respiratory disease transmission [33]. A shared room is one in which patient placement occurs regardless of symptoms or diagnosis. A convenience subset of 38 patients also had a nasopharyngeal sample sent for laboratory-PCR analysis during the course of their ED treatment, ordered by their treating physician outside of this study. The procedures followed by this laboratory are described by Rogan et al (2017) [34]. Briefly, ED nasopharyngeal swabs for viral testing are sent to an off-site facility where they are batch-processed then analyzed with the Respiratory Virus Panel XT8 (GenMark) for 9 viruses \u2013 influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza 1\u20134, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and coronavirus; TAT is 8\u201324 hrs.",

Over half of patients tested were virus positive, 84% of these with Influenza A or RSV. Nearly 70% of virus positive patients were placed in shared rooms with patients who did not have ARI symptoms. The ED has 57 beds, including 15 isolation rooms; the remaining rooms are shared between 2\u20136 patients (median 4). The bed selection process was not recorded per patient and is at the discretion of the triage physician, per level of acuity and room availability. Sharing rooms increases the likelihood of nosocomial infections, which can cause severe complications and increase morbidity among ED populations. EDs nationwide are overburdened and crowded especially during peak ARI seasons. Rapid virus detection could improve triage decisions and allow more efficient investigation, treatment, and disposition of patients.",

However, over three-fourths of eligible cases did not receive this therapy; similar under-utilization has been previously reported [14]. Appropriate delivery of oseltamivir is especially important in outbreak situations to limit virus transmission. Antiviral medications should be administered within 48 h of symptom onset [35] yet delays in patient presentation, lack of a reliable clinical diagnosis, and diagnostics with low sensitivity or long TATs make timely antiviral delivery difficult. Similarly, our study suggests that rapid test results could improve patient management by preventing unnecessary antibiotic administration. In 9% of cases, antibiotics were prescribed because no clear etiology was determined. These are likely patients for whom a viral source may have caused reconsideration of antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic resistance is a looming threat to public health. Taken together, POC-PCR could be another clinical intervention employed to improve antimicrobial stewardship.",

Our study\u2019s generalizability is potentially handicapped by conduction in a single academic medical center - operating protocols and disease burden vary geographically and by hospital type. However, given the ARI burden during winter months, we propose that our results are likely generalizable during peak ARI season.",

Our data suggest that during peak ARI season, a rapid and accurate POC-PCR in ED triage could improve social distancing measures for patients who present with ARI symptoms, optimize antiviral and antibiotic prescription practices, and shorten patient dispositions. Further investigation of ED triage POC-PCR and its utility during non-peak ARI season should be conducted.",
