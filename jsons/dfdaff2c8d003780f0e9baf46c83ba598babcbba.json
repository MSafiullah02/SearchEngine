It is therefore necessary to evaluate the disease outcomes among the African countries as the situation unfolds for early identification of best practices for adoption. Methods: In this study, COVID-19 disease outcomes (confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries), testing capacities and disease management approaches among African countries were evaluated. The relationship between COVID-19 infections in African countries and their performance on global resilient indices including the Human Development Index (HDI), performance on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Global Risk Index (GRI) were also examined. Data acquired from various standard databases were evaluated over a period of 75 days from the date of reporting the index case.

            "text": "Testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Africa is expected to be very challenging. The Real Time -Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) molecular diagnostic technique remains the primary method of diagnosing SARs-CoV2 all over the world and indeed on the African continent. Although RT-PCR remains a very sensitive method of diagnosis, it has been associated with significant cost, averaging 60 dollars per sample (https://allafrica.com/stories). This has been a major setback to extensive testing in Africa. A second challenge is insufficient accredited level 3 and 4 Laboratories for testing and also the low level of manpower required to perform such tests (Nkengasong and Mankoula, 2020) . At the beginning of the outbreak, only two referral laboratoriesone in South Africa and another in Senegalwere reported to be capable of carrying out the test (WHO, 2020c) . The vast majority of national laboratories in Africa lacked the reagents necessary for testing since it is a novel virus. Therefore, testing capabilities needed to be scaled up rapidly in order to give the continent a fighting chance. Although some of the countries have experience responding to communicable diseases like Ebola and Influenza, with 28 countries in the WHO African Region being members of WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance Network (WHO, 2020c), the testing capabilities for COVID-19 on the continent at the onset of the outbreak was definitely a major source of concern. The huge instant demand for testing reagents and reliable testing kits also put a lot of constraints on supply chains and resulted in production and delivery bottlenecks all around the world. This limited ability to test for the COVID-19 infection was expected to be a major stumbling block for the management of the disease across the continent. It will therefore be necessary to evaluate the testing capacities for COVID-19 infection achieved across the African continent as we enter a phase of quantitative easing of lockdown on the continent, in order to identify best practices, if any, for emulation.",

            "text": "Due to the poor state of health infrastructure, poverty concerns, unfavourable living conditions in the cities, population densities and prevalence of underlying disease conditions like lower respiratory infections, malaria, diarrheal, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, there is serious concern that the impact of COVID-19 on the continent will be devastating (The World Bank, 2020; Martinez-Alvarez, 2020) . According to UNECA (2020), Africa could see 300,000 deaths from the coronavirus this year even under the best-case scenario. Under the worst-case scenario with no interventions against the virus, Africa could see 3.3 million deaths and 1.2 billion infections. Africa's largest cities have grown relentlessly for decades to become home to tens of millions of people spread between overcrowded central settlements and offshoots of similarly unplanned sprawl and satellite towns. Countries with higher urban populations are faced with the logistical and communication challenge of informing, monitoring, and possibly isolating a larger pool of at-risk people (Hoogeveen et al., 2004) . It was feared that the pandemic could be difficult to keep under control in Africa, and could cause huge economic problems if it spreads widely (Gibbs, 2005) . Shielding the vulnerable from COVID-19 could involve a mixture of approaches which are traditional and also based on standard medical guidance of early identification of confirmed cases, swift contact tracing with physical isolation, community engagement and focused care, eventually by those who have recovered from the virus (Gilbert et al., 2020) . These measures will work best when based on local innovations appropriate to particular social contexts and designed with input from those involved. These could build on practices of respect for the elderly and community organising in many African settings, as well as, experiences gained from fighting previous epidemics. It is therefore not surprising that many of the African countries have evolved varied approaches to the management of the diseases with different level of successes. An evaluation of the approaches adopted would merit further investigation.",

In Africa, 33 countries are classified as part of the least developed countries in the world. This classification is based on the evaluation that the countries exhibit the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development, with the lowest human development Index ratings of all countries in the world (United Nations, 1999) . Most African countries have fragile health care system which could be easily overwhelmed by a high incidence of the pandemic. Preventive measures that are to be implemented to forestall a catastrophic effect would consequentially have negative impacts on trade and business especially for the informal sector who earn a living daily. Successful response to a global pandemic like COVID-19 will therefore require massive interventions from international agencies like World Health Organization (WHO), The World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund (IMF), African Union (AU), African Development Bank (ADB), African Export-Import Bank (Afrexim bank) and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to avert a devastating outcome of the disease on the continent. Many of the interventions from the various international organisations must be targeted at preventing unprecedented infection rate, illness and death from COVID-19 and also, to cushion the social disruption and economic consequences of the outbreak in African countries (African Union, 2020) . In this regards, the hypothesis therefore, is that the existing vulnerabilities will likely make the COVID-19 pandemic a disaster of epic proportion in Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) already warned that Africa faces severe danger. It will therefore be necessary to also examine the relationship between COVID-19 infections in African countries and their performance on global resilient indices including the Human Development Index (HDI), performance on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Global Risk Index (GRI).",

Therefore, the time when index case was reported on the continent does not seem to matter with respect to the eventual magnitude of the prevalence of the disease.

The stark differences in the disease outcomes especially the very high number of recorded deaths due to COVID-19 in countries in Europe and North America compared to countries in Oceania and Africa should necessitate the need for healthcare professionals in the concerned countries to investigate the underlying factors responsible for the wide disparity in COVID-19 disease outcomes across the continents.",

The results depict that the number of recorded deaths in relation to total confirmed cases was found to be highest in Northern Africa with Algeria having the highest number followed by Egypt and Morocco. Other countries in Africa have recorded relatively low number of deaths during the observation period. On the whole, Africa seems to have recorded a significantly low number of deaths associated with COVID-19 contrary to prediction models which had anticipated up to 300,000 deaths from the coronavirus this year even under the best-case scenario. Under the worst-case scenario with no interventions against the virus, Africa could see 3.3 million deaths and 1.2 billion infections (Gilbert et al., 2020 and UNECA, 2020) . The dire consequences of COVID-19 in Africa has been attributed to poor state of health infrastructure, poverty concerns, unfavourable living conditions in the cities, population densities and prevalence of underlying disease conditions like lower respiratory infection, malaria, diarrheal, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (The World Bank, 2020) . The underlying reasons for the relative low death rates to COVID-19 across African countries when compared to North America, Europe and Asia should warrant further examination of possible factors responsible for this rather unexpected outcome.",

A cursory look at the management approaches by some of these countries is the strict application of WHO protocol to contain the disease, testing of mainly the people showing the disease symptoms and ensure that all patients who test positive are systematically hospitalised, whether they have symptoms or not, and their contacts are quarantined (www.theafricareport.com). Additionally, most of the countries are providing prompt treatment of the patients with a range of drugs especially Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine and Chloroquine-Azithromycin combination (www.africanews.com), despite the current guidance from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that there is no known cure for this virus with 100% certainty.

Mass production of the testing kits is proposed to commence immediately in the United Kingdom and Senegal once it meets regulation standards. Reacting to this challenge, Kenya Medical Research Institute has also started manufacturing of Covid-19 testing kits that will give results in fifteen minutes.

In this evaluation, no strong relationship currently exists between the global resilient indicators and COVID-19 cases across Africa. Several plausible explanations may be offered for this observation. First, COVID-19 is a new vulnerability that possibly has little regard for existing resilience structures and mechanism. This is supported by the high infection and death incidences recorded even in the so called developed countries in Africa such as Egypt, Algeria, South Africa and Morocco with highly rated resilient systems. Secondly, the observation may also be associated with the variety of initiatives and interventions of multilateral and bilateral agencies that provided several amenities, debt reliefs, grants and loans to many of African countries especially those with lowly rated resilient systems. There is very little doubt that the timely and critical support to developing and low-income in close collaboration with all UN agencies also contributed immensely to minimizing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on global resilient indicators in Africa. It is quite possible that the continent might still be in its early days in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, so it may not yet be time for complacency. Deliberate efforts must be put in place to ensure vigilance, cooperation, collaboration and identify what measures worked or did not work across the continent. The establishment of channels to share best practices among African countries and develop solutions which take into consideration the peculiarities in Africa must be put in place as we enter into maybe a more exponential phase of the infection or a Post-COVID world.",

The African Union Commission and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) had launched a new initiative, the Partnership to Accelerate COVID-19 Testing (PACT): Trace, Test & Track (CDC-T3). The partnership is to facilitate implementation of the Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19, this initiative is said to have been endorsed by African Ministers of Health on 22 February 2020 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and approved by the Bureau of the Assembly of the African Union Heads of State and Government on 26th of March 2020. This initiative is reportedly aimed to strengthen capacity to test for large numbers of COVID-19 across Africa within the next six months (https://africacdc.org/news/). Similarly, the African Union Commission, Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and WHO, in partnership with African countries, have established the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR) working closely to expeditiously scale up diagnostic testing.
