Also, there are noninflammatory etiologies (eg, vascular, metabolic) that may mimic the clinical and radiologic appearance of TM. Further complicating the diagnostic process is the frequent coexistence of systemic autoantibodies in NMO and, sometimes, MS. The implications of an incorrect diagnosis can be severe, as treatment may not only be ineffective, but may exacerbate the underlying disease process. The cause of TM remains unknown despite an extensive workup in about 15% to 30%4 of patients and is therefore referred to as \u201cidiopathic\u201d according to set criteria.7\nBox 1\nexplains important terms related to TM.Box 1Nosology of transverse myelitis\n\nMyelopathy: a broad, generic term referring to a lesion affecting the spinal cord\nMyelitis: refers to an inflammatory disease of the spinal cord\nTransverse myelitis (TM): classically describes a pathobiologically heterogeneous syndrome characterized by acute or subacute spinal cord dysfunction resulting in paresis, a sensory level, and autonomic impairment below the level of the lesion\nAcute Complete TM (ACTM): TM causing paresis of the lower and/or upper extremities, sensory dysfunction (characterized by a sensory level), and autonomic impairment below the level of the lesion. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there is typically a single lesion spanning 1 or 2 vertebral segments; on axial sections, there is either full-thickness involvement, or the central portion of the spinal cord is maximally affected.\nAcute Partial TM (APTM): TM causing asymmetric neurologic impairment (localizable to the spinal cord) or deficits attributable to a specific anatomic tract. On MRI, it spans 1 or 2 vertebral segments; there is involvement of a small portion of the spinal cord on axial sections.\nLongitudinally-Extensive TM (LETM): a spinal cord lesion that extends over 3 or more vertebral segments on MRI. On axial sections, it typically involves the center of the cord over more than two-thirds of the spinal cord area.\nSecondary TM: TM related to a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disorder (eg, lupus, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, sarcoidosis). It is typically an ACTM.\nIdiopathic TM: TM without any clear etiology despite a thorough investigation. It should meet the criteria listed in Table 8.\n",

An apoplectic onset with deficits reaching the nadir in less than 4 hours indicates a vascular event. An insidious, progressive course in which the deficits continue to worsen beyond 4 weeks is uncharacteristic of TM. Clinically, TM may present as one of several syndromes of the spinal cord. Acute complete TM (ACTM) manifests as paresis/plegia, sensory dysfunction (characterized by numbness, paresthesias, or other manifestations in conjunction with a sensory level), and autonomic impairment below the level of the lesion. Acute partial TM (APTM) results in asymmetric manifestations or deficits specific to particular anatomic tracts; manifestations include the hemi-cord (Brown-Sequard), central cord, or posterior column syndrome, as well as selective tract impairment. Table 1\ndescribes these syndromes. Distinguishing ACTM and APTM has etiologic and prognostic significance, as discussed later.",

ACTM causes a complete spinal cord syndrome; on axial sections, there is either full-thickness involvement, or the central portion of the spinal cord is maximally affected.29 APTM results in asymmetric spinal cord involvement or neurologic deficits attributable to a specific anatomic tract; on axial sections, there is involvement of a portion of the spinal cord. Patients with APTM are at increased risk of recurrence and transition to MS.13, 29, 30 Conversely, ACTM carries a lower risk of transition to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) and is usually related to other causes (eg, SAIDs).

It is unclear if it shares the same pathophysiological underpinnings as ADEM (and represents different ends of a spectrum) or if they are separate entities. Both are preceded by typically monophasic, steroid-responsive events preceded by infections. It is difficult to determine if PITM is caused by direct microbial invasion (causing myelitis by either the direct pathogenic destruction, or from the pathogen-triggered immune reaction), or a consequence of immune-mediated, inflammatory mechanisms induced by a remote infection. The antecedent infection has typically resolved before the onset of TM and it is difficult to demonstrate the offending organism in the spinal cord parenchyma.",

There are several serologic, CSF, and radiologic differences among the patients with recurrent ITM in these studies and may represent distinct clinical entities that have yet to be characterized. A Korean study of 15 patients with recurrent ITM lends support to the hypothesis that recurrent ITM may represent a unique entity.260 More longitudinal studies are needed to clearly elucidate the characteristics of recurrent ITM.",

Any condition that increases the patient's body temperature (eg, febrile illness, exercise, hot weather, hot baths, hot showers, stress, menses, dehydration) can cause a pseudoexacerbation. Any infection, particularly urinary tract infections (UTI) may result in pseudoexacerbation. In fact, any metabolic or physiologic derangements (eg, hyperglycemia, hypertension) has the potential to transiently worsen prior neurologic deficits. In conclusion, worsening of prior myelopathic symptoms in a patient with previous TM does not automatically implicate a recurrence or relapse. Pseudoexacerbation should be considered and investigations into the cause of pseudoexacerbation should be undertaken. Treatment of recurrent TM entails immunosuppressive therapy, but treatment of pseudoexacerbation involves addressing the underlying cause (eg, treating the UTI).",
