            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic human pathogen and part of the commensal flora. It causes many life-threatening infections in patients in intensive care units (ICUs). This includes bacteremia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, infections related to the presence of indwelling medical devices and wound, and surgical site infections. These infections are a leading cause of prolonged hospital stay, additional antibiotic use, higher morbidity and mortality, and increased healthcare-associated costs (e.g., [1]). Several virulence factors play a role in the pathogenicity of S. aureus including toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), enterotoxins, hemolysin, exfoliative toxins, and various adhesive proteins [2]. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains acquired the mecA gene\u2013containing staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) [3]. Increased emergence of nosocomial multidrug resistance among MRSA strains has become a global concern in hospital environments [4]. About 30% of humans are nasal carriers of S. aureus and have a greater risk to develop endo-infections [5]. Thus, screening of high-risk patients (MRSA or methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)-colonized) and eradication of S. aureus nasal carriage are essential for reducing the overall frequency of S. aureus infection in hospital settings and particularly in ICUs [5, 6]. In this regard, molecular typing methods are useful in tracing and monitoring of nosocomial outbreaks [7]. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of nasal S. aureus colonization in ICU-acquired S. aureus infections.",

The current study was performed during a 9-month period (December 2013 to September 2014), and this trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with IRCT number 92-153-6. During this episode, the S. aureus nasal colonization status was checked by culture for all patients at admission in ICUs. Patients were classified into two groups: carriers and non-carriers. Half of the carriers were decolonized using mupirocin, confirmed by a negative nasal follow-up culture [8]. Patients were admitted to the ICU and screened for S. aureus infection during their stay. Exclusion criteria included allergy to mupirocin, taking antibiotics, a stay in the ICU < 48 h, a known S. aureus infection at ICU admission, or the development of an S. aureus infection during the first 48 h of ICU stay. Nasal and ICU-acquired S. aureus infectious isolates were investigated by spa typing, for methicillin resistance and for the presence of virulence genes.",

A high MRSA prevalence of 54.3% was found in this study which was comparable with that found by previous local studies (42.8% and 42%) [15, 16]. The frequency of MRSA in infection was two times (54.3% versus 27.67%) higher than in nasal specimens (p = 0.01) which indicated the presence of endemic MRSA in our ICUs. This likely causes an increased risk of MRSA acquisition. Our S. aureus infection incidence in ICUs (11.8%) was much higher than the 2%, 2.3%, and 6% recorded in previous studies [17, 18].

            "text": "The pvl positivity rate among clinical isolates (17.4%) was higher than among nasal isolates (8%). Ayepola et al. [19] showed that the pvl prevalence among infectious isolates (80.2%) was higher than among isolates from carriers (53.4%) which matched our study results. All 9 pvl-positive S. aureus isolates obtained from nasal cavities were MSSA, and a significant difference was found between pvl-positive strains and the absence of the mecA gene (p = 0.01). The prevalence of the pvl gene in our MSSA isolates was higher than that in MRSA isolates and in another study from our region [20]. All clinical and nasal isolates in this latter study carried the sea gene while the sec gene was absent in clinical isolates and found only in 1.8% of the nasal isolates. Nashev et al. [21] reported sea as the most abundant enterotoxin gene in S. aureus isolated from nasal specimens. In contrast, the sec gene was the most abundant enterotoxin encoding gene, followed by sea, sed, and seb, with a lower frequency in a study from Tehran [22]. Normannoa et al. [23] reported the highest levels of SED, followed by SEC, SEA, and SEB. In this study, the frequency of acme in clinical isolates (96.4%) was higher than in nasal isolates (63.4%). We found that clf and fnb were present among all clinical isolates and that can was observed among 93.5%. The same genes were less frequent in nasal isolates (97.3% for clf, 98.2% for fnb, and 64.3% for can). Ghasemian et al. [24] showed that the clf gene was present among all isolates and recorded 63%, 6%, and 63% for fnbA, fnbB, and cna, respectively. Similar to our results, Duran et al. [25] showed that 78.4% of their isolates carried the cna gene.",

A study from Malaysia showed that spa types t037, t10562, and t0421 were most common among carriers and spa types t037, t4184, and t10562 were the most frequent among clinical isolates [5]. In another study in Iran, spa types t304 and t7688 were reported as the most abundant types among clinical isolates [30]. ST239 MRSA has been reported as the dominant clone in Iranian hospitals [31], many of which were of the spa type t030, demonstrating the significant local spread of this type. It can be concluded that many infections acquired in the ICU originate from within the hospital and are hence exogenous.",

Although many studies showed that S. aureus infection is of an endogenous nature, our results indicate that the source of ICU S. aureus infection can as well be exogenous and a dominant and locally circulating MRSA clone plays an important role in our ICU infections. Given the apparent fact that S. aureus causes serious problems in the hospital setting, the use of appropriate measures to prevent the transmission of these strains between patients, personnel, and hospital environment is necessary. We show that nasal S. aureus decolonization during ICU stay protects patients against infection [6], even in the presence of easily circulating nosocomial MRSA clones.",
