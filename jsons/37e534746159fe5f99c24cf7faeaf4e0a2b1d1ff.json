In the present study, a novel EV-G strain (KOR/KNU-1811/2018) that resulted from cross-order recombination was discovered in diagnostic faecal samples from neonatal pigs with diarrhoea that were negative for swine enteric coronaviruses and rotavirus. The recombinant EV-G genome possessed an exogenous 594-nucleotide (198-amino acid) sequence, flanked by two viral 3C pro cleavage sites at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends in its 2C/3A junction region.",

The complete KNU-1811 genome shared 73.7% nucleotide identity with a prototype EV-G1 strain, but had 83.9%-86.7% sequence homology with the global EV-G1-PLCP strains. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the Korean recombinant EV-G's own VP1 and inserted foreign PLCP genes are most closely related independently to contemporary chimeric G1-PLCP and G17-PLCP strains respectively. These results implied that the torovirus-derived PLCP gene might have undergone continuous nucleotide mutations in the respective EV-G genome following its independent acquisition through naturally occurring recombination. Our results advance the understanding of the genetic evolution of EV-G driven by infrequent viral recombination events, by which EV-G populations laterally gain an exotic gene encoding a virulence factor from heterogeneous virus families, thereby causing clinical disease in swine.",

            "text": "Recently, novel EV-G1, -G2, and -G17 variants were reported in faecal samples from independent porcine diarrhoeic diseases in the United States, Belgium, and Japan. These recombinant viruses identically carry a porcine torovirus (ToV) papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene in the 2C/3A junction region of their genome, arising from a natural cross-order recombination between EV-G (order Picornavirales) and torovirus (order Nidovirales) (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Neto et al., 2017; Knutson, Velayudhan, & Marthaler, 2017; Shang, Misra, Hause, & Fang, 2017; Tsuchiaka et al., 2018) . Although the pathogenic association of EV-Gs with enteric diseases has not been determined, acquiring ToV-PLCP from a recombinant event appears to influence EV-G pathogenesis by acting as an innate immune antagonist, thus leading to clinical manifestations in pigs (Shang et al., 2017) Enteric illness is not only an important health problem in piglets but also causes substantial economic losses to the global pork industry. A large diversity of viral and bacterial species is known to cause clinical and subclinical enteritis in pigs. Among these aetiological agents, swine enteric coronaviruses (SECoVs), including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), are considered to be representative enteropathogenic viruses that cause serious diarrhoea outbreaks, accompanied by high neonatal mortality, which pose significant financially threats in most pig-producing countries. In South Korea, monoinfections of each SECoV or rotavirus, and their co-infections, are typically responsible for diarrhoeal diseases in piglets, which are routinely diagnosed using a RT-PCR-based method in veterinary diagnostic laboratories (Jang, Lee, Kim, & Lee, 2017; Lee & Lee, 2018) . In a minority of clinical cases, none of aforementioned viral pathogens could be detected in diarrhoeal samples, suggesting that other viruses are involved in porcine scours. Viral metagenomics studies indicated that kobuviruses, sapoviruses, astroviruses (AstV), and EVs are the most commonly detected porcine viruses in the faecal virome (Sachsenr\u00f6der et al., 2012; Shan et al., 2011) ; therefore, genomic detection and sequencing analysis have been applied to detect these stool viruses from clinical diarrhoeic pigs that were negative for SECoVs and rotavirus. In this study, we identified a novel recombinant EV-G from diarrhoeic piglets that contains a 198-aminoacid (aa) insertion encoding a ToV-PCLP protein and characterized its complete genome to reveal new genetic features.",

Four faecal samples (KNU-1811) from diarrhoeic weaned pigs were submitted to our laboratory in 7 April 2018 and were initially tested for SECoVs and rotavirus using RT-PCR, which did not detect these enteric viral pathogens. Further RT-PCR assays, followed by sequencing and BLAST searching, were conducted to identify two pig scours-associated viruses, AstV and EV-G, using virus-specific primers (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Neto et al., 2017; Lee, Jang, & Lee, 2015) . Using this conventional approach, we were able to (Shang et al., 2017) . The viral 3C pro protease trims the EV-G precursor polyprotein posttranslationally into the 2C and 3A proteins at a well-defined cleavage sequence (ALFQ\u2193GPPT) (Blom, Hansen, Brunak, & Blaas, 1996) . Furthermore, a previous study using reverse genetics revealed that the US EV-G17-PLCP strain functionally produces the exogenous PLCP gene in virus-infected cells, demonstrating its own ALFQ\u2193GPPV and AEFQ\u2193GPPT sequences as the putative cleavage sites (Shang et al., 2017) . Considering the sequence similarity of the putative cleavage sites including GPPT\u2212ALFQ, GPPA\u2212ALFQ, and GPPE\u2212ALPQ among global strains (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Neto et al., 2017; Knutson et al., 2017; Tsuchiaka et al., 2018) , therefore, the cleavage of the inserted PLCP gene appears to be guaranteed using each corresponding cleavage sequence. Consistently, the recombinant ToV-PLCP of the EV-G KNU-1811 strain is bordered by two analogous predicted 3C pro cleavage sites, ALFQ\u2193GPPV and AVFQ\u2193GPPT, at its N and C termini, respectively, indicating its proteolytic processing by 3C pro into a functional product (Figure 1a) . Subsequent phylogenetic analysis based on the PLCP genes of EV-Gs and nidoviruses revealed that the foreign PLCP gene of KNU-1811 is most closely related to that of the US EV-G17 strain, forming a well-supported cluster with PLCPs of other EV-Gs, but is only distantly related to those of porcine, bovine, and equine toroviruses, showing lower sequence identities (41.0%\u221251.3% in the aa sequence) (Supporting Information Figure S1a ).",

Three overlapping cDNA fragments encompassing the entire viral genome were amplified using RT-PCR with gene-specific primer sets, individually cloned into a pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced in both directions using two commercial vector-specific T7 and SP6 primers and KNU-1811-specific primers. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the KNU-1811 genome were determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), as described previously (Lee & Lee, 2013) . The KNU-1811 strain sequence was deposited in the GenBank database under accession number MH663501. The complete genome of EV-G KOR/ KNU-1811/2018 was 7,985-nt in length, excluding the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail.",

Similarly, a phylogenetic tree based on the EV-G complete genome sequences revealed that the Korean G1-PLCP strain clustered together with global G1-PLCP strains ( Figure 2b) . However, all G1-PLCP strains, including KNU-1811, were phylogenetically distant from the authentic G1 strains, but appeared to share a common ancestor within the large clade containing the EV-G genotypes G3, 9, and 10. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis excluding the PLCP sequence in all chimeric strains resulted in the same tree topology (Supporting Information Figure S1b ).

To the best our knowledge, this is the first documentation of EV-G recombinant (designated EVG/Porcine/KOR/KNU-1811/2018/G1-PLCP) in a Korean pig population. Similar to recent identifications reported in the US, Belgium, and Japan, the current study provided another example of horizontal viral gene transfer, termed cross-order recombination, between enterovirus and porcine torovirus from two separate orders, Picornavirales and Nidovirales respectively. This rare event seems to occur more frequently in EV-G1 than in EV-G2 and -G17 genotypes, and might contribute significantly to viral evolution.",

More intriguingly, the sizes of the recombinant EV-G PLCP sequences and their junction sequences are heterogeneous among individual strains, suggesting independent evolution in respective geographical areas. These findings might indicate that the recombination occurred independently in South Korea, and subsequently, the exogenous PLCP sequence has undergone substantial genetic drift (e.g., non-silent point mutations) after its random insertion into the corresponding EV-G genome through genetic shift (e.g., viral recombination). However, we cannot exclude that the recombinant virus was introduced from the US or other countries by import of breeding pigs or other unknown sources, and the genetic evolution independently proceed thereafter. Despite EV-Gs not being associated with clinical illness, all recombinant EV-G-PLCP strains were confirmed from diarrhoeic samples, indicating them as potential causative agents of porcine diarrhoeal diseases. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that the lateral acquisition of the PLCP gene might represent a novel host immune evasion strategy of EV-Gs to establish their pathogenic potential under certain circumstances. Therefore, future work should to aim to investigate the prevalence of authentic and recombinant EV-G infections, and their genetic diversity, including inter-/intra-genotype and inter-family recombinations among Korean swine herds. Our study support new insights into EV-G evolutionary processes, in which EV-Gs horizontally obtain a virus-encoded anti-immune constituent associated with virulence from completely unrelated viruses through recombination, thereby naturally arming the EV-G population with an acquired gene necessary for viral fitness and long-term survival in their natural host.",

Subsequently,~1,200 nucleotides of sequence from the inserted regions flanked by the EV-G 2C and 3A genes of the KNU-1811 isolates from the same farm were determined by the traditional Sanger sequencing method. Initial nucleotide sequencing indicated that all of the KNU-1811 strains were almost genetically identical to each other, with 99.6%\u221299.8% sequence similarity and identified an exogenous 594-nt-long sequence at the 2C/3A junction of the enterovirus genome (Figure 1a). The unique 594-nt insertion sequence (encoding a deduced protein of 198 amino acids) was queried against the GenBank nt sequence database and found to be homologous to the PLCP sequence variants that were identified recently in recombinant EV-G strains from the US, Belgium, and Japan (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Neto et al., 2017; Knutson et al., 2017; Shang et al., 2017; Tsuchiaka et al., 2018). The length of the inserted PLCP sequence varied among strains from different geographical locations (194/223-aa, 212-aa, and 211/217-aa for the US, Belgium, and Japanese strains respectively) (Figure 1b). The PLCP sequence of Korean EV-G only shared 75.0%\u221289.3% aa sequence identity with other recombinant EV-G1, -G2, and -G17 strains, exhibiting the highest identity with the US EV-G17 strain 08/NC_USA/2015",
