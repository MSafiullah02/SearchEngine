            "text": "Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), characterized by fever and/or hemorrhage, is a zoonotic viral disease with high mortality. The agent causing CCHF is a Nairovirus, which is a RNA type from the bunyaviruses family. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through tick bites. Rare transmissions to medical staff as a result of contact with blood or blood products have also been reported. The general non-specific symptoms of CCHF are fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, and myalgia, which are observed after the contact. However, ecchymosis, petechia, vaginal bleeding, and epistaxis can also be observed. In addition, intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and alveolar hemorrhage that are life-threatening and often responsible for mortality can be observed as well [1\u20134]. The geographical location, exposure to animals with ticks, and contact with suspicious infected blood and blood products in the patients\u2019 history are helpful in diagnosis. CCHF can cause sudden and severe bleedings and death in the end [1].",

Therefore, examination with chest X-ray (CXR) (which is specific for pulmonary pathologies) must be considered. We may propose simple pulmonary imaging such as CXR to be used within the following 5 days after the first examination as an effective tool to evaluate clinical course and severity of the disease.",

            "text": "Pleural effusion, one of the findings that can be seen in the clinical follow-up of CCHF, was observed in 64 patients (37.8%) in our study. Pleural effusion was observed bilaterally in 34 (20.6%) patients. There was no pleural effusion in any of the patients in the study of Do\u011fan et al., but pleural thickening was observed only in seven patients (6.5%). There was pleural effusion in only one patient in the study of Bilgin et al. [11, 12]. Interestingly, there was a very significant relationship between pleural effusion and survival in our study (p < 0.001). Other CXR findings such as consolidation, ground glass opacity, and atelectasis were observed in 74, 49, and 30 patients, respectively. The number of patients with respiratory symptoms was much higher in our study than the number of patients in the other studies. The pathophysiological mechanism of pleural effusion has not been clearly demonstrated in CCHF. However, it has been stated that it can share similarities with mechanism of pulmonary pathologies such as pleural effusion, pneumonitis, hemoptysis, and alveolar hemorrhage in other febrile viral hemorrhagic diseases [15, 16]. It has been suggested that pulmonary findings emerge due to the increase in capillary permeability in febrile viral hemorrhagic diseases. Particularly, virus in the circulatory system causes an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability causing capillary endothelial damage [17]. In a study performed on dengue hemorrhagic fever, a total of 468 CXR taken from 363 patients were examined and parenchymal infiltration and pleural effusion were observed in more than half of the patients on the third day of follow-up. These findings were stated as the most frequent radiological findings. Moreover, these radiological findings were found to be closely related to laboratory findings of leukocyte count, platelet count, APTT, ALT, and albumin levels in the same study [18]. Similar to other febrile viral hemorrhagic diseases (in particular to dengue hemorrhagic fever), clinical conditions must be kept in mind in CCHF. Replacement therapy was also performed with blood and blood products in some patients with sudden decrease in hemoglobin values and with alveolar hemorrhage findings in our study. In conclusion, pleural effusion and other findings related to pulmonary involvement can be seen in CCHF due to endothelial damage caused by viral load in the circulation, increased capillary permeability, and hemorrhages due to low platelet.",

The results of the study revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two examination techniques in terms of detecting parenchymal infiltration, alveolar infiltration, and pleural effusion. In our study, 23 of the 129 patients went through both CT and CXR examinations. When these patients were compared, it was found that there was consolidation in CXR of the four patients and pleural effusion in one patient while they were not observed in thorax CT. On the other hand, based on thorax CT results, ground glass density was detected in four patients and atelectasis in two patients, and these were not observed in CXR. However, there was a time period changing from 2 to 14 days between CXR and thorax CT examinations. Therefore, there was a possibility of response to the treatment and spontaneous regression or progression in the findings.",

Pulmonary involvement (pleural effusion, consolidation, and ground glass opacity) affects the survival in CCHF negatively, and further examination should be performed with thorax CT in case of necessity. Radiological findings emerging on the fifth day of our study were demonstrated to be related closely to both survival and many laboratory findings.
