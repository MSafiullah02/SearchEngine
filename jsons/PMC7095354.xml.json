            "text": "Antibiotic therapy of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is now regarded as a two-stage process [1\u20133]. The first stage involves administering broad-spectrum antibiotics to avoid inappropriate treatment in patients with true bacterial pneumonia. The second stage involves de-escalating an initially appropriate antibiotic regimen to avoid overuse of antibiotics, by streamlining, shortening or stopping therapy, as dictated by the patient's clinical response and information about the bacteriology of the infection. Although de-escalation therapy is suggested to be part of any appropriate antimicrobial stewardship in patients with VAP [3], controversy continues regarding the outcomes associated with its implementation. Indeed, some reports suggest that de-escalation therapy does not affect mortality and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay [4, 5], whereas others claim that it does significantly improve them [6, 7]. Moreover, there are suggestions that de-escalation therapy improves mortality at 2 weeks after VAP onset, but does not significantly affect either mortality at 1 month or the duration of ICU and hospital stay [8]. However, the potential effect of de-escalation therapy on outcomes, that are based on clinical diagnosis of VAP, may be difficult to assess, as clinical diagnosis is frequently associated with risk for overestimation of the incidence of infection [9, 10]. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess outcomes in association with the implementation of de-escalation therapy in a well-defined group of patients [11] who had developed VAP as confirmed by two separate cultures, one quantitative tracheal aspirate and one bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample, that both had to be positive.",

The clinical response was decided at 72 h reassessment by absolute consensus of five attending physicians after a clinical round. The microbiological information that the attending physicians used to de-escalate antibiotic therapy, to establish the appropriateness of the initial antibiotic regimen and to confirm the diagnosis of VAP, in patients with clinical suspicion for infection, was derived from quantitative tracheal aspirate or BAL. Nevertheless, because the aim of the study was to assess outcomes with de-escalation therapy and not to evaluate the contribution of different methods to diagnosis, we studied only patients in whom the diagnosis of VAP was confirmed by both quantitative tracheal aspirate and BAL samples, and who received an appropriate empiric antibiotic regimen for all isolates of tracheal aspirate and BAL that reached significant concentration. Data interpretation was performed by two independent investigators and the attending physicians were blind to the nature of the study. Patients could not be entered more than once into the study, and only the first VAP episode for each patient was considered.",

Using the kit assigned to the case, the attending physicians collected the respiratory sample within 12 h after clinical suspicion for VAP was raised. Patients in whom a kit other than the assigned kit was used were not studied. However, all patients had both types of samples, because, within 2 h after the collection of tracheal aspirate or a BAL sample by the attending physicians, the other type of sample was collected by two independent investigators before any antibiotic introduction or modification. The empiric antibiotic regimen was started as soon as both samples, tracheal aspirate and BAL, had been collected.",

            "text": "De-escalation therapy was defined as either the switch to an agent that was less broad spectrum than initial therapy, or the use of fewer drugs [14]. Thus it was possible to have either or both types of antibiotic changes in a given patient. The use of fewer drugs involved stopping oxazolidinone when MRSA was not grown, and aminoglycoside or quinolone when P. aeruginosa was not identified. The empiric antibiotic regimen was guided by the Gram stain, the presence of risk factors for multiresistant pathogens and the local microbiology data [15]. Antibiotics were ranked according to activity spectrum against Gram-negative bacteria (highest 4, lowest 1) as follows [6, 13]: carbapenems 4; extended spectrum penicillins 3, quinolone and aminoglycoside 2, and beta-lactams 1 [16]. This rank of activity spectrum was used to de-escalate therapy to the narrowest spectrum agent available. In the absence of P. aeruginosa, carbapenem was de-escalated to extended-spectrum penicillin, or to quinolone, or if possible to a non-antipseudomonal beta-lactam, and extended-spectrum penicillin was de-escalated to quinolone or if possible to a non-antipseudomonal beta-lactam. In the presence of P. aeruginosa, de-escalation therapy was as above but, the final regimen had to include two antipseudomonal drugs. Therefore, in this case carbapenem was de-escalated to extended-spectrum penicillin or to a antipseudomonal beta-lactam, and extended-spectrum penicillin to an antipseudomonal beta-lactam, while quinolone or aminoglycoside was continued as part of the combination regimen.",

Recently, Kollef et al. found reduced mortality for patients who received de-escalation therapy compared to those who did not (17% vs. 23.7%) [6]. Improved mortality was also observed by Rello et al. with de-escalation of antibiotic therapy (18.4% vs. 43.4%) [7] and by Soo Hoo et al (8% vs. 23%) [8]. The diagnosis of VAP by two positive quantitative cultures, one tracheal aspirate and one BAL sample, in all study patients in our data, should probably be considered for the interpretation of the difference between our observations and those of Ibrahim et al. and of Micek et al., who found no benefits in mortality and duration of stay from de-escalation therapy [4, 5].",

First, patients in whom antibiotic therapy was de-escalated ended up receiving fewer antibiotics. Stopping unnecessary antibiotics helps to prevent potentially harmful side effects and has been shown to reduce airway colonization [21\u201323] and the risk of secondary episodes of infection [4, 23], which are known to adversely affect patient outcome [21, 24]. Within this context should probably be interpreted the good outcomes that we observed, in consistency with previous reports [21], for patients assigned to management by BAL, as more than half of them had de-escalation of antibiotic therapy and therefore ended up receiving fewer unnecessary antibiotics.",

In addition, the diagnosis of VAP and the appropriateness of the empiric treatment had to be confirmed by both quantitative tracheal aspirate and BAL. Thus, the results of this study cannot necessarily be extended to other populations. Another limitation is that investigators were aware of the patients' assignment and of their de-escalation therapy status. However, obstacles in blinding were posed by the necessity to collect both samples in all study patients and to modify treatment in the context of de-escalation therapy. Nevertheless, our efforts were focused on standardizing care and using rigorous criteria to evaluate outcomes. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that our study was not specifically designed to test the hypothesis that de-escalation therapy is superior to a non-de-escalation regimen in terms of improving clinical outcomes. Only a prospective randomized trial comparing these two approaches would be able to answer such a question.",
