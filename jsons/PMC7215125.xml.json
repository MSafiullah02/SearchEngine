The PDCoV genome contains a 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) followed by open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF 1a/1b); sequences encoding the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), accessory protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), accessory protein 7 (NS7), and accessory protein 7a (NS7a) proteins; and a 3\u2019 UTR [13, 14]. The E protein is a small envelope protein that plays an important role in viral assembly and infection [15]. The M protein plays an important role in inducing protection and mediating the course of disease [16, 17]. The N protein is principally produced in infected cells and plays multiple roles in viral replication and pathogenesis [13, 18]. The S protein contains three receptor-binding S1 subunits tightly packed into a crown-like structure and three membrane fusion S2 subunits forming a stalk. This protein has several structural features that may facilitate viral immune evasion, including compactness, concealed receptor-binding sites, and shielded critical epitopes [19]. Because the S protein is the major surface protein, it is also the main target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) during infection and a focus in vaccine design [20].",

Although previous studies have confirmed the postinfection effect of PDCoV in newborn and suckling piglets, few reports have addressed the pathogenicity of and immune response to PDCoV in conventionally weaned pigs. In addition, although a correlation of resistance to disease induced by PEDV infection with age has been described, little is known about the effect of PDCoV infection and re-challenge on weaned pigs. Therefore, 45-day-old weaned pigs were challenged and rechallenged with different inoculation doses of sixth-passage (P6) culture-adapted PDCoV strain CH/XJYN/2016 (GenBank accession number MN064712), and the immune response in the PDCoV-infected, conventionally weaned pigs was evaluated.",

A previous study showed that PDCoV significantly induced expression of IFN mRNA in infected Peyer\u2019s patches at 3 dpi [27]. In this study, however, the levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 peaked 7 dpi. The difference may be due to the longer sampling interval. Therefore, a shorter sampling interval will help to obtain more-detailed information about the levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 after PDCoV-infection. Generally, swine enteric coronavirus challenge studies use the TCID50 as the infectious titer [11, 21]. Practically, however, the infectious titer of PDCoV strains differs between pigs and cells, but the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD50) of PDCoV in pigs of different ages is unknown. Therefore, before starting this study, a separate experiment was performed, and the results showed that 1000 TCID50 is the lowest dose that can still reliably produce clinical symptoms in weaned pigs. Therefore, in this study, the infection dose used for rechallenge was 1000 TCID50.",

The average serum IFN-\u03b3 levels were calculated, and the SD was plotted at each point. Significant differences are indicated by asterisks (p < 0.05)",
