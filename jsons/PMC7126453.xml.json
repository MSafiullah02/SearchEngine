This stress creates a demand on an individual to make a decision on the balance between work and family. People have difficulty working in different roles or even multiple roles (as a supervisor in work, a parent at home, a child helping elderly parents in a Chinese cultural context) which leads to stress (Grandey and Cropanzano, 1999). In 1991, Nelson-Horchler conducted a survey and discovered that only 36% of the respondents rated a job as the most important priority in their lives. This finding was echoed by the generation X\u2019ers emphasis on quality of life (Report, 1999). In other words, if employees feel that work\u2013life is not balanced, they may leave the job and seek \u201cquality of life\u201d.",

With an addition of 12,326 new hotel rooms set to open in Hong Kong between 2007 and 2009, the employment market in the hotel industry is envisaged to remain extremely buoyant such that career opportunities with good prospects are plentiful (Wong, 2007). Subsequently, there has been a noticeable uplift in demand for talent in the hotel industry.

As the issue of work\u2013life balance is now receiving greater attention in the community, undoubtedly, many organizations and employees across different industries are gradually becoming aware of practices for balancing work and life. Some companies may copy the best practices and some may simply focus on the 5-day work week alone due to the complex options available.

Due to the ever-changing social, economic and legislative conditions in different countries, there is literally no universal definition on work\u2013life balance. Much discussion about the concept was triggered by the entry of a greater number of women into the workforce. Dual income parents, therefore, struggle to balance their work and family responsibilities. Many firms started to feature \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d related practices such as child care facility provision for workers with babies or school age children. Some exemplars of good practice also include paid maternity leave or opportunities to work more flexibly (Pocock, 2005).",

            "text": "Empirical research on employee burnout has been extensively conducted in the hospitality industry especially to explain why food-service managers suddenly quit their job (Tabacchi et al., 1990). Due to the phenomena of chronic labor shortage, role overload, long and irregular working hours exacerbated by considerable pressure over an extended time period, the prevalence of burnout is higher in service industries. This is so because one's job involves a high degree of interaction with clients (Vallen, 1993). A survey in the Human Resource Management International Digest (2002) indicated that managers who suffer from burnout are relatively young, under 40 years of age, and, most likely, working in front office or food and beverage service. A correlation of high burnout to high turnover was also recorded (Buick and Thomas, 2001). Thus, larger hospitality organizations in the U.K. or the U.S. are increasingly adopting sophisticated family-friendly practices to become an employer of choice (Doherty, 2004). It is the workplace which becomes a matter of issue in the case of poor performance, low morale or increased absenteeism irrespective of the source of employees\u2019 problem.",

The WIP and PIW were measured by four conflicts: time-, strain-, energy-, and behavior-based conflict. While WEP and PEW were measured by five enhancements: time-, strain-, energy-, behavior- and support-based enhancements. Among all the demographic variables, only tenure at the employees hotel was found to have significance connection to the perceived difficulty and success regarding work and personal life balance (Hsieh et al., 2004).",

Moreover, in many companies, promotion depend on how late employees remain in the office rather than how productive or efficient they are (Taylor, 2006). Fortunately, following the wave of 5-day work schemes in Asia, the Hong Kong government finally took the step forward to implement a 5-day work week policy in the hope of reducing work pressure and \u201cto bolster civil service morale, promote social harmony and bring about positive impact on the community\u201d (JobsDB, 2006).",

Job vacancies and employee turnover rates continued to stay high in 2006 (HKIHRM, 2007c).

A recent survey on Hong Kong people also indicated that 83% of respondents believed work\u2013life balance is important in today's workplace (HKIHRM, 2006a, Mahtani, 2006). This paradigm shift in the attitude of workforce, who now believe in family roles and responsibilities as well as physical and emotional well-being, is not to be overlooked.

A good management system can also be achieved by a well-designed roster system, job re-design and cooperation between departments aiming to facilitate a smooth handover of duties. For example, a front desk officer would be able to handover their duties to the next shift worker and leave on time on a normal business day instead of following up unnecessary matters with the Accounts Department. However, very often, line managers are the ones that can \u201cmake or break\u201d the policy and may affect how the system works. A matter of face may develop implicitly among the team because of the inappropriate practice by the manager. Worst of all, a non-supportive environment would be cultivated among team members.

This could be a potential problem with an employee who suffered from burnout as a result of the complexity of time- and strain-based conflict. From the factor mean, it shows that hotel employees have less flexibility in controlling their time and roster. It is understandable that a hotel job is operated 24 h a day and is highly labor intensive. Everyone is assigned to be \u201cpresent\u2019 for a duty at a certain time slot per day. Even during holidays, staffs are allocated into the roster for maintaining the service.

As discussed in Section 5.1.4 that emphasized scheduling discussed the importance of providing flexibility to enable individual's control and choices, this factor took a micro perspective focusing on working hours alone. A common example being widely adopted in western countries is the option of working fewer hours at a pro-rated salary and benefits. For example, a half-time job provides the flexibility for an employee to consider working 4 h less everyday but keeping the 5-day or 6-day work week pattern. Employees can trade off their salary in exchange for more free time with the huge benefit of job security. The reason why employees tend to project a neutral stance on this factor but leaning towards the other side is because this kind of work arrangement is not common in Hong Kong. Though there are casual laborers commonly found in the hotel industry, they are regarded as \u201cstand-by\u201d staffs who are not employed permanently or on a contractual basis. Thus, it is hard for employees to weigh its merits and drawbacks. The purpose of earning less but in exchange for more personal time is clearly seen.",
