The serum concentration of individual acute phase serum proteins increases from 2 to 3 times to several hundred times (depending on the protein in question) during the acute phase of an inflammation (Kushner, 1982). Haptoglobin and SAA are major acute phase proteins in most species studied (Mackiewicz et al., 1993).",

            "text": "To evaluate the usefulness of these markers of inflammation for diagnosis of disease, and as markers of severity of disease in domestic animals, it is important to define precisely the disease conditions leading to acute phase responses of different proteins in the species in question. The bovine acute phase protein reaction has been reviewed most recently by Eckersall and Conner (1988) and Gruys et al. (1994). Haptoglobin concentrations in healthy cattle are often undetectable (Makimura and Suzuki, 1982; Conner et al., 1986; Eckersall and Conner, 1988) but during an acute phase response bovine haptoglobin can increase 50\u2013100 times (Conner et al., 1988, Conner et al., 1989; Godson et al., 1996; Gruys et al., 1993), making it the most prominent acute phase protein in cattle (Alsemgeest et al., 1994). On the other hand, SAA is a remarkably moderate acute phase protein in cattle increasing around 2\u20135 times during an acute phase response (Boosman et al., 1989; Gruys et al., 1993; Alsemgeest et al., 1994; Werling et al., 1996). Nevertheless, SAA seems to react faster than haptoglobin in response to an acute phase protein inducing event (Gruys et al., 1993; Horadagoda et al., 1994) and the difference between serum concentrations induced by acute and chronic inflammation, respectively, was found to be bigger for SAA than for haptoglobin in naturally infected cattle (Alsemgeest et al., 1994; Horadagoda et al., 1999).",

After washing, the biotinylated IgG of the monoclonal antibody 1D1 (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) (prepared as described in Godson et al. (1996)) was added to the plates for 2 h. Detection of bound antibody was accomplished by addition of a 1/2000 dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Gibco/BRL) for 2 h, followed by washing and the addition of the color substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate di(TRIS) salt (Sigma) in 0.5 mM MgCl2 (pH 9.8) with 1% diethanolamine. Absorbance was measured on a Bio-Rad 3550 microplate reader at a wavelength of 405 nm (reference wavelength 490 nm). The concentration of haptoglobin in serum samples was determined by comparison of absorbances to a standard curve generated from dilutions of antibody affinity-purified bovine haptoglobin (Godson et al., 1996). The detection limit of the assay was defined as two times the standard deviation of the background OD.",

Skinner et al. (1991) found that haptoglobin concentrations of more than 200 \u03bcg/ml indicated mild infection, values above 400 \u03bcg/ml diagnosed severe infection, while extended pathological conditions were typically associated with haptoglobin concentrations in the 1\u20132 mg/ml range (Skinner et al., 1991; Saini et al., 1998). In Godson et al. (1996), maximum haptoglobin concentrations correlated with maximum rectal temperature, sick score, weight change and decreased zinc concentration as well as with death after experimental herpesvirus type-1/P. haemolytica co-infection. Alsemgeest et al. (1994) found that bovine SAA was a more sensitive indicator of acute disease than haptoglobin. Also, while a bovine SAA response was found within 360 min after intravenous LPS, no increase in haptoglobin was found in the same time frame (Werling et al., 1996). Similarly, Horadagoda and Eckersall, 1993, Horadagoda et al., 1994 found SAA to react more rapidly than haptoglobin to experimental P. haemolytica infection. The difference in the inducibility of SAA and haptoglobin by acute and chronic disorders, respectively, was recently confirmed in cattle with various acute or chronic diseases (Horadagoda et al., 1999) and SAA was also reacting more rapidly and sensitively than haptoglobin in the present study (see above). In man, SAA is the acute phase protein that is most sensitive to viral infections (see e.g. van Leeuwen and van Rijswijk, 1994).",

In other studies, viral infection, either experimental (bovine herpes virus followed for 4 days after infection (Godson et al., 1996)) or natural (rinderpest virus (Spooner and Miller, 1971)) did not give rise to elevated haptoglobin. However, an acute phase haptoglobin response was observed in foot-and-mouth disease virus infections (H\u00f6fner et al., 1994), simultaneously with or a couple of days later than viraemia and clinical disease. Also, bovine herpes virus infections did lead to a haptoglobin response when animals were followed for more than 4 days p.i. (Godson et al., unpublished results).",

Haptoglobin reacted with the biggest relative increase but SAA was most sensitive to BRSV-infection. None of the control animals showed any sign at any time of haptoglobin above the detection limit of the assay or SAA above normal levels even if Mycoplasma spp. were isolated from all control animals. It must be concluded therefore that bovine haptoglobin and SAA can react to viral infection. Considering the timing of the response and the correlation between the magnitude of the response and the severity of the infection, it can be established that viruses causing only local pathology can indeed induce acute phase responses, most probably indirectly via virus-mediated tissue perturbations.",
