Suppose that there are two pairs of agents having risky partnerships to begin with: Ann and Bob are one pair, and Chlo\u00e9 and Dane the other (Network 1 in Figure 1\n). Each individual has a fixed probability of contracting a given virus independently of her partnerships, and an infected individual transmits the virus in any given partnership with probability p. Infection and transmission are independent across agents and partnerships, respectively. To build intuition, consider first the extreme case in which each partnership transmits the virus with probability one\u2014that is, p=1. The partnership between Chlo\u00e9 and Bob is risky for each of them, since under some states of the world only one of them is infected, and hence their partnership would infect the other. We claim that Ann and Dane's partnership (that is, a switch from Network 1 to Network 2 in Figure 1) increases Chlo\u00e9 and Bob's incentives to become partners (as long as their initial partnerships are sufficiently valuable so that neither of them wants to become isolated instead). Indeed, in Network 2, the states of the world where one catches the virus are the same as the states of the world where the other one catches it, so their partnership is risk free. Remarkably, the same is true for all positive values of the transmission probability p: Ann and Dane's partnership decreases the probability that only one of Chlo\u00e9 and Bob is infected, hence increasing their incentives to become partners.",

In order to clarify this point, and to highlight the role that the strategic choice of partners plays in the mechanism that we illustrate, in Appendix B we describe a random-matching version of our model, and we show that, as long as the infection risk is not extreme, strategic complementarities in risky partnerships do not arise in this model.

On the one hand, p is the probability that infection is transmitted between two prospective partners. On the other hand, p influences the probability that the agents under consideration have already become infected through contagion from other agents in their networks. This explains why the risk of edge N2N3 is increasing in p for low values of p and decreasing in p for high values of p: the risk of edge N2N3 is highest when the transmission probability is high enough so that this edge has a substantial probability of transmitting an infection but low enough so that there is a substantial probability that only one of N2 and N3 are infected.",

In contrast, the non-monotonicity depicted in Figure 4 is present for all values of infection probability q, and hence for all levels of prevalence. To understand the difference, note that, even when q is very small, so the prevalence of the disease is very small, the edge N2N3 is essentially riskless when the transmission p is high\u2014not because the probability that N2 and N3 are already infected is high, but because the probability that N2 is infected conditional on\nN3\nbeing infected is high.\n",

Using equation (4) in Appendix A, it is easily verified that there exists p\u22c6\u22c6 such that condition (i) holds for all transmission probabilities p<p\u22c6\u22c6. Using equation (6) in Appendix A, it is easily verified that there exists p\u22c6<p\u22c6\u22c6 such that condition (ii) holds for all p>p\u22c6.A cross-complete network is stable if and only (i) the benefit c(\u03bcX\u2212\u03bcN2) from deleting an edge is smaller than its cost s2, or(2)\u03bcX\u2212\u03bcN2\u2264s2c, and (ii) no two agents have incentives to remove one of their edges and create an edge between them; that is, \u03bcM3\u2265\u03bcX (see Figure 3\n). Using equation (7) in Appendix A, it is easily verified that condition (i) is satisfied for all p except possibly those in an intermediate range (p_,p\u203e). The fact that p\u22c6<p_ follows from Proposition 3.1. Condition (ii) follows from the fact that combining equation (5) and equation (8) in Appendix A gives \u03bcM3>\u03bcX.It only remains to be shown that a network that is neither pair complete nor cross complete is not stable. The fact that \u03bcM3>\u03bcX implies that no subnetwork of a stable network is isomorphic to network M. Note that no agent is part of more than two edges in any stable network, so a component of such a network contains a node that is part of two edges if and only if all of the nodes in this component are part of two edges (otherwise, because n is even, there must be two agents who are each part of only one edge who can profitably deviate by removing their one edge and matching to each other). Hence, we only have to show that no subnetwork of a stable network is isomorphic to network M\u2032 (see Figure 3). This follows from the fact that \u03bcX<\u03bcM\u2032, where \u03bcM\u2032 denotes the infection probability of each agent in M\u2032.2\nThis last inequality is intuitive: The probability that each of the agents M1\u2032,M2\u2032,M3\u2032 and M4\u2032 becomes infected goes down when the three edges M3\u2032M6\u2032, M6\u2032M5\u2032, and M5\u2032M2\u2032 are replaced by the edge M3\u2032M2\u2032, since this leaves each of them with the same number of edges but decreases the independent sources of infection. \u25a1\n",

Also, let sm+1<\u03bam+1, where \u03bam+1 is sufficiently small so that networks in which agents have strictly more than m partners are not stable either. The only equilibrium network candidates are then the m-complete and the (m+1)-complete networks. This is because\u2014conditional on each agent having k partnerships\u2014the probability of infection of a member of a clique is as low as it can be. As a result, in every network other than the m-complete network in which every agent has m\u22121 partnerships, a group of m agents can profitably deviate by dropping all of their edges with others and forming all possible links among themselves. Similarly, in every network other than the (m+1)-complete network in which every agent has m partnerships, a group of m+1 agents can profitably deviate by dropping all of their edges with others and forming all possible links among themselves.The m-complete network is stable if and only if an agent's cost (in terms of infection risk) of forming an additional edge is greater than its benefit. In other words, the m-complete network is stable if and only if4\n(3)sm\u2264(1\u2212\u03bcm)\u03bcmpc. Since \u03bcm<1/2 is increasing in p, the right-hand side of (3) is also increasing in p. Hence, there exist unique values pm and pm+1 that satisfypm=smc(1\u2212\u03bcm)\u03bcmandpm+1=sm+1c(1\u2212\u03bcm+1)\u03bcm+1, respectively. These are the threshold values of the transmission probability p below which the m-complete and the (m+1)-complete network, respectively, are not stable. Given that \u03bcm<\u03bcm+1 and that sm+1\u2264sm, we have that pm+1<pm. Hence, because the cost of an additional link (1\u2212\u03bcm)\u03bcmpc increases with p, a reduction in p from pm to a value between pm+1 and pm renders the m-complete network unstable, and leaves the (m+1)-complete network as the only stable network.We conclude by showing that there exists a threshold p\u203em>0 such that, if pm<p\u203em, then everyone's expected utility in the (m+1)-complete network when p=pm is strictly lower than in the m-complete network. Given that pm is increasing in sm, this implies that there exists \u03bam such that, if sm<\u03bam, then pm\u2264p\u203em, and hence the expected utility in the (m+1)-complete network when the transmission probability is at the threshold pm at which the m-complete network becomes unstable is strictly lower than in the m-complete network.Define the mab\n-network to be the m-complete network with an extra edge (between agents a and b). Figure 7\nillustrates the 334-network when n=12. By definition of the threshold pm, if the transmission probability p is equal to pm, then everyone's expected utility in the m-complete network is the same as the expected utility of agents a and b in the mab-network. Since agent a has m edges in both the mab-network and the (m+1)-complete network, it is enough to show that, when p is small enough, her infection probability in the mab-network is smaller than in the (m+1)-complete network. For this, note that the number of different paths of length 2 that can transmit the infection to her in the (m+1)-complete network is larger than in the mab-network.5\nGiven that the number of different paths of length 1 that can transmit the infection to her in the (m+1)-complete network is the same as in the mab-network (namely, the number of neighbors she has, m), and that, when p is small enough, the probability that the network has a path of length strictly greater than 2 is second-order compared to the probability that the network has a path of length 2, we conclude that, when p is small enough, agent a's probability of infection is larger in the (m+1)-complete network than in the mab-network. \u25a1\n",

In the case that we have focused on throughout the main body of the paper (in which agents only value up to two heterosexual partnerships), this step is simpler because Network N is a strict subset of Network X, which directly implies that everyone's infection probabilities are strictly smaller in the former than in the latter. In the more general setting discussed in this section, the reasoning is a bit more subtle, because there are edges in the (m+1)-network that are not in the mab-network, and vice versa. As a result, it is not immediate to see that, when the transmission probability p is at the threshold pm, the infection probability of agents a and b in the (m+1)-complete network is larger than in the mab network. As we have shown, however, this is true as long as the threshold transmission probability pm is smaller than an upper bound p\u203em>0. As an illustration, the following table provides the approximate upper bounds on pm in the case m\u2208{2,3,4,5,6} and q=1/4.p\u203e2p\u203e3p\u203e4p\u203e5p\u203e6.57.51.47.43.4 Hence, if p3<.51, for example, then a reduction in the transmission probability forces a society that starts with a 3-complete network and a transmission probability just above p3 to switch to a different social structure (e.g., a 4-complete network), potentially making everyone worse off unless the reduction in the transmission probability is large enough to compensate for the reduction in welfare created by the induced change in social structure.",

A similar analysis holds when we define the m-complete and the (m+1)-complete networks to be networks with distinct components, with the components not necessarily being cliques, but with everyone having exactly m\u22121 and m edges, respectively. Hence, the mechanism that we have illustrated in this paper is present in alternative models of network formation in which the agents organize themselves into different components (not necessarily cliques), and in which no two agents can have incentives to form an additional edge (so that, when the transmission probability p moves below a threshold, the efficient network is no longer stable, while a denser network can still be stable).\n",

In contrast to our mechanism, however, the feedback effects in Kremer (1996) only make partially-effective vaccines more desirable. For example, for those with sufficiently many partners, the introduction of a partially-effective vaccine will actually increase the marginal risk of infection from an additional partner, reducing their optimal number of partners, and hence making the pool of available partners safer for everyone.

In a similar vein, Toxvaerd (2019) uses a dynamic version of a standard economic epidemiological model to show that reducing the infectiousness of a disease can\u2014via negative welfare effects along the transition between steady states\u2014reduce agents' discounted lifetime welfare. However, as in related economic epidemiological models (e.g., Kremer 1996 and Fenichel et al. 2011), reductions in the infectiousness of a disease cannot reduce anyone's steady state welfare. In particular, the steady state per-exposure probability of infection in Toxvaerd (2019) is independent of the infectiousness of the disease. Hence, each agent can\u2014by choosing her exposure level exactly as before the change in infectiousness\u2014be exactly as well off as before. In contrast, we show\u2014using a different model that allows agents to strategically choose whom to interact with\u2014that the conclusion that a free and perfectly safe but only partially-effective vaccine necessarily makes everyone better off in steady state is an artifact of the anonymous-mixing assumption of the standard models.",
