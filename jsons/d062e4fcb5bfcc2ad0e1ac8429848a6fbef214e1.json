SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse infectious diseases such as influenza, smallpox, bioterrorism, to name a few. On the other hand, Agent-based model begins to spread in recent years. The model enables to represent behaviour of each person in the computer. It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model. The study designs a model based on Epstein's model in which several health policies are decided such as vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of medical staff to infection control measures and so on. Furthermore, infectious simulation of Ebola haemorrhagic fever and Zika fever, which have not yet any effective vaccine, is also implemented in the model. As results of experiments using the model, it has been found that preventive vaccine, antiviral medicine stocks and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread. In addition, a modern city is vulnerable to Zika fever due to commuting by train.",

SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse such diseases based on a mathematical model. After an outbreak of SARS, the first SIR model of SARS was published and many researchers studied the epidemic of the disease using this model. When an outbreak of a new type of influenza is first reported, the U.S. government immediately starts an emergency action plan to estimate parameters of its SIR model. Nevertheless the SIR model has difficulty to analyse which measures are effective because the model has only one parameter to represent infectiveness. For example, it is difficult for the SIR model to evaluate the effect of temporary closing of classes because of the influenza epidemic. The agent-based approach or the individual-based approach has been adopted to conquer these problems in recent years [1] [2] [3] [4] . The model enables to represent behaviour of each person. It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model.",

Most cases have no symptoms and present are usually mild including fever, red eyes, joint pain and a rash [8] , but it is believed that the Zika fever may cause microcephaly which severely affects babies by a small head circumference. Epstein [9, 10] made a smallpox model based on 49 epidemics in Europe from 1950 to 1971. In the model, 100 families from two towns were surveyed. The family includes two parents and two children thus the population is each 400 from each town. All parents go to work in their town during the day except 10 % of adults who go to another town. All children attend school. There is a communal hospital serving the two towns in which each 5 people from each town work. This model was designed as an agent-based model, and then simulation of infectious disease was conducted using the model. As results of experiments showed that (1) in a base model in which any infectious disease measures were not taken, the epidemic spread within 82 days and 30 % of people died, (2) a trace vaccination measure was effective but it was difficult to trace all contacts to patients in an underground railway or an airport, (3) a mass vaccination measure was effective, but the number of vaccinations would be huge so it was not realistic, (4) epidemic quenching was also effective, and reactive household trace vaccination along with pre-emptive vaccination of hospital workers showed a dramatic effect. Ohkusa [11] evaluated smallpox measures using an individual-based model of infectious diseases. The model supposed a town including 10,000 habitants and a public health centre. In the model, one person was infected with smallpox virus at a shopping mall. They compared between a trace vaccination measure and a mass vaccination measure. As a result of simulation, it was found that the effect of trace vaccination dropped if the early stage of infection was high and the number of medical staff is small, while the effect of mass vaccination was stable. Therefore timely and concentrate mass vaccination is required when virus starts spreading. The estimation about the number, place and time of infection is needed quickly and the preparation of an emergency medical treatment and estimation system is required for such occasions.",

The case under 10 infected people is 15 times, and the case in which all people are infected by mosquitoes is 85 times.",

As health policies, vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of vaccinations per day by medical staff, mass vaccination, and trace vaccination are implemented in the model. As a result of experiments, it has been found that vaccination availability per day and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread for the mass vaccination strategy. On the other hand, small quantities of vaccination for approximately 10 % of inhabitants are vaccinated per day are able to control an epidemic in most cases. In the case of using a public transportation to commute, however, even if half of inhabitants were vaccinated per day, it would not prevent the epidemic. Two thirds of vaccinations per day are required each day to prevent the epidemic. In addition to that, this study also conducts the model of Zika fever to understand the mechanism of spreading Zika virus via mosquitoes. As a result of experiments, it is crucial for preventing an Zika epidemic to get rid of mosquitoes from a train station where people use it to commute to their office.",
