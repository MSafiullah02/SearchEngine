Thus, the importance of meticulous skin care and daily inspection in PHO and HSCT patients is paramount and provides opportunities to identify areas of inflammation or breakdown early. Skin inspection should be done routinely, with special attention to high-risk areas like intravascular catheter insertion sites and the perineum. Rectal thermometers, digital rectal examinations, and suppositories should be avoided to prevent mucosal breakdown. As part of an effort to reduce colonization of cutaneous surfaces, daily chlorhexidine baths have been shown to reduce HAIs and transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) in oncology patients [1, 2]. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is a cationic bisbiguanide that serves as a topical antiseptic. CHG binds to negatively charged bacterial cell wall proteins altering the bacterial cell wall equilibrium and helps in reducing bacterial colonization of the skin [1]. Education of patients, families, and staff on the importance of these practices is key to compliance with this preventative strategy and should be made a priority.",

Oral mucositis, which can be considered an acute inflammation and/or ulceration of the oral/oropharyngeal mucus membranes, is a common adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents. It can cause oral pain/discomfort as well as difficulties in eating, swallowing, and speech. Mucositis is most commonly caused by chemotherapeutic agents which prevent DNA synthesis such as methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and cytarabine, particularly in HSCT recipients. Oral rinses with normal saline or CHG-containing products are recommended 4\u20136 times per day to prevent oral mucositis [2, 3]. Patients with painful mucositis might not comply with oral care regimens, however, putting them at increased risk for infections from oral flora such as bacteremia due to viridans streptococci. Mouth rinses containing alcohol should be avoided because they can aggravate mucositis. Neutropenic patients should also be instructed to brush their teeth carefully in order to prevent gingival injury [3]. A regular soft toothbrush or an electric brush can be used to minimize trauma [3].",

In the NHSN report, antibiotic resistance was noted to be high in oncology units, including ampicillin and/or vancomycin resistance for Enterococcus faecium and fluoroquinolone resistance for Escherichia coli [5]. Although less than 4% of Enterobacteriaceae were reported to have carbapenem resistance, the emergence of such organisms in this population is of significant concern [6]. Among Candida infections in this population, fluconazole resistance among non-C. albicans and non-C. parapsilosis isolates was up to 41%, whereas fluconazole resistance in C. albicans and C. parapsilosis was <4% [5].",

In the NHSN definition, a positive blood culture would qualify as a MBI-LCBI if it results from one or more groups of selected commensal organisms of the oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract and occurred in the presence of signs and symptoms consistent with mucosal barrier injury (MBI) in PHO or HSCT patients [7].

            "text": "Studies performed in adult oncology patients have consistently shown the benefit of using prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the incidence of bacterial infections [17]. Levofloxacin prophylaxis in adults has been shown to reduce the incidence of fever, bacterial infection, hospitalization rates, and all-cause mortality [18, 19]. Based upon such data in adults, the IDSA Guidelines for the Use of Antimicrobial Agents in Neutropenic Patients with Cancer state that fluoroquinolone prophylaxis should be considered for high-risk patients with prolonged severe neutropenia [20]. Pediatric studies on antibiotic prophylaxis are limited. A pediatric pilot study on the use of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis for pediatric patients receiving delayed intensification therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) showed a reduction in hospitalization, intensive care admission, and bacteremia when compared to controls [21]. In another study, levofloxacin prophylaxis in patients with ALL reduced the odds of febrile neutropenia, possible bacterial infection, and confirmed bloodstream infection by \u226570%. It also reduced the use of other broad-spectrum antibiotics and the incidence of C. difficile infections [22]. In other studies, however, ciprofloxacin prophylaxis did not decrease the incidence of overall bacteremia or duration of fever or mortality in pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients [23]. Furthermore, increasing quinolone resistance among gram-negative organisms is a concern recently observed in the NHSN database of pediatric oncology patients with CLABSI [5]. In addition, the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis in PHO could increase the possibility of developing other MDROs, invasive fungal infections, or drug-related toxicities. Though some authors suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in children undergoing induction chemotherapy for ALL, there is currently insufficient data to inform definitive guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent bacterial infections in pediatric oncology patients [19\u201321]. Notably, an open-label randomized clinical trial was recently conducted of levofloxacin prophylaxis vs. no prophylaxis in children with AML, relapsed ALL, and HSCT recipients. Among patients with AML and relapsed ALL, prophylaxis was associated with a reduction in rates of bacteremia; there was a numeric reduction in bacteremia in the HSCT recipients, but this did not achieve statistical significance. It is unclear at this time how these new findings will influence practice and future guidelines [24].",

Given the immunosuppressed status of children with malignancy and/or HSCT, immunization of those closest to them at home and those caring for them in the hospital is critically important in preventing infections. Live attenuated vaccines contain a theoretical risk of being transmitted to an immunocompromised host. Live oral polio vaccine, which is no longer administered in the United States, is an absolute contraindication for people taking care of this high-risk population. However, data suggests that measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), varicella zoster, and herpes zoster vaccines can be safely provided to healthcare workers and household contacts [25]. If healthcare personnel develop a rash that cannot be covered within the first 42 days following receipt of the varicella vaccine, they should avoid any contact with immunocompromised patients until all rash has crusted to avoid the potential risk of transmitting vaccine strain varicella to patients [25]. Infants living in households with persons who are immunocompromised including PHO and HSCT patients may be safely immunized against rotavirus ; it is recommended, however, that immunocompromised persons avoid contact with the infant\u2019s diapers/stool for 4 weeks following vaccination to minimize risk of acquiring vaccine strain rotavirus infection [26]. An inactivated influenza vaccine is preferred for personnel taking care of immunocompromised children as opposed to live attenuated influenza vaccine [25]. Vaccination against other non-viral pathogens (such as pneumococcus or pertussis) by family members is another important method to minimize the risk of serious infection in PHO patients.",

A cutoff value of a GM optical index of \u22650.5 in blood and a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid level of \u22651 is considered a positive test, though an optimum cutoff value is not well defined in children [52, 53]. Invasive fungal disease due to fungi other than Aspergillus species may have negative galactomannan tests. \u03b2-D-Glucan is a cell wall component found in many (but not all) species of fungi, and an elevated serum \u03b2-D-glucan assay can be caused by IC, IA, and other molds [53, 54]. The optimum cutoff value of \u03b2-D-glucan for a positive test is unknown in children, but \u226580 pg/ml is used in most studies [54]. Both GM and \u03b2-D-glucan assays have variable sensitivity and specificity among children and should be interpreted with caution. The sensitivity of GM has been reported to range from 65 to 82% in children with malignancy and IA [55, 56]; by contrast the \u03b2-D-glucan assay has high sensitivity for IFD (~90%) but suffers from poor specificity [57]. False-positive \u03b2-D-glucan can be due to systemic bacterial or viral coinfection, receipt of antibiotics (such as piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate), hemodialysis, receipt of albumin or intravenous immunoglobulin, material containing glucan, oral mucositis, and other GI mucosal breakdowns [54]. Other PCR-based fungal diagnostic tests are under investigation but have low sensitivity and specificity.",

Hepatosplenic and renal nodules should also raise suspicion of IFD.
