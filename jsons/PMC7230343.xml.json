The first infections were linked (with some, but not firm evidence) to the Huanan Seafood Market (Wuhan, China) [2]. Zhou et al. [3] used sequencing technology to show that SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus possess a similarity of gene sequence up to 96.2%, suggesting bats as the possible source of SARS-CoV2. As of 16 April 2020, over 2 million cases of COVID-19 and over 137,000 corresponding deaths have been reported in over 210 countries, where these numbers are growing exponentially daily [4,5]. The flu-like symptoms of COVID-19 usually appear 5\u20136 days after infection and include coughing, sore throat, fever, muscle and body aches [6], and even loss of smell or taste in some cases [7].",

There are four significant issues that the food industry and the food supply chain should address in the new era. Firstly, as consumers are looking to protect themselves and their immune system by adopting healthier diets, the availability of bioactive ingredients of food and functional foods may become critical, as the demand for these products may increase. Secondly, food safety is a significant issue in order to avoid the spreading of the virus between producers, retailers, and consumers. Thirdly, food security issues have emerged due to the lockdown of a billion people inside their houses. Last but not least, the sustainability of the food systems in the era of pandemics is another issue that the sector should address in order to restrict relevant crises in the future.",

These two outbreaks were diseases of the lower respiratory tract with a similar clinical presentation at their early stages of infection (e.g., cough and fever), leading to significant mortality among vulnerable individuals (e.g., those who do not have a robust immune system and those who smoke) and older people [9].",

            "text": "The consumption of foods rich in vitamins and of functional foods can boost the immune system to help fight off viruses [10,11]. For instance, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is known to play a protective role, as it supports the immune function and is necessary for the development and repair of all body tissues [12]. Also, under certain conditions, it restricts the susceptibility of the lower respiratory tract to infection [13]. Foods rich in Vitamin C include citrus fruits, kiwifruits, and broccoli. Other vegetables, like carrots, spinach, and sweet potato, are rich in Vitamin A. This vitamin comprises a group of fat-soluble compounds (including retinol, retinoic acid, and \u03b2-carotene) that play an essential role in the immune function and are known to lower the susceptibility to infections [14]. For instance, isotretinoin (a derivative of vitamin A) mediates the down-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a crucial host cellular protein required for the entry of SARS-COV-2 in the body [15]. Besides, supplementation with Vitamins D and E may boost our resistance to COVID-19 [16], as the decrease in cattle\u2019s levels of Vitamins D and E could lead to infection by a bovine coronavirus [17]. Das [9] suggested that the oral or intravenous administration of bioactive lipids (such as arachidonic acid and other unsaturated fatty acids) may aid in enhancing resistance and recovery from SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS infections. Natural polyphenols such as hesperidin and rutin have been shown to be effective inhibitors of COVID-19 main protease (Mpro), which is considered a potential therapeutic drug target [18].",

Although bats (as natural hosts) were a likely source of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers and scientists are still seeking information and evidence of how COVID-19 is transmitted. Several other animals may also be relevant hosts, e.g., it is known that SARS-CoV-1 is transmitted to humans from civet cats, while MERS-CoV is transmitted to humans from camels [25]. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the virus is spreading from person to person mainly via respiratory droplets that people cough, sneeze, or exhale [25]. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are closely monitoring the transmission of COVID-19, which is affecting almost all countries around the globe, causing thousands of deaths. Previous outbreaks of related coronaviruses, particularly MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), showed that food is not a route of transmission for these relevant viruses [26,27]. At the moment (16 April 2020), there is no evidence to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is different in this respect. Transmission is indeed possible if an infected individual touches food, and shortly afterward, another individual collects it and touches its eyes or mucous membranes of the mouth or throat [6,28]. Fresh foods may also be similarly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 before being frozen. In this case, the transmission may happen. For instance, it is known that MERS and SARS-CoV-1 can remain infectious for up to 2 years in a frozen state [28].",

In line with this, FAO is suggesting specific strategies, e.g., expanding emergency food assistance programs and providing immediate assistance to the agricultural production of smallholders by boosting e-commerce. Likewise, it proposes focusing on key logistics bottlenecks (e.g., hampered food transportation across provinces and perishable foods like fishery, vegetables, and fruits), addressing tax and trade policies to keep the supply chain moving and implementing fiscal measures in the case that food prices jump [34].",

These measures restricted acute food shortages in the affected areas. Empty food shelves were observed temporarily (e.g., due to panic buying of supplies) and mainly in urban areas where vegetables like cauliflower and green onions could not be shipped out. Authorities approached food enterprises to gather information about their supplies of staple commodities like rice and fresh produce (e.g., vegetables) and connected them with sellers. Popular shopping mobile applications (apps) (e.g., the platform of Pinduoduo that assists farmers in finding alternative buyers in small city centers, e-commerce apps by JD.com and Alibaba Group) were also used for this purpose [36]. Besides, China assured the sufficient nourishment of the local population by releasing at least 300,000 tons of pork reserves [36]. Italy implemented relevant laws to force food makers to keep reserves for emergency purposes [35]. This practice resulted in a moderate reduction of agricultural production.

In particular, information and communication technologies (ICTs), apps, Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, BIG Data, and artificial technology can be used to collect real-time data in order to improve the communication between suppliers and buyers and simplify the redistribution of foods. Apps using Big Data and artificial intelligence could be implemented to connect farmers and suppliers with markets and get acute responses if any alterations of demand occur [37]. Similarly, ICTs could be enacted during on-farm handling, postharvest, storage, and food transportation. For instance, the implementation of ICTs could extend the shelf-life of fresh produce by minimizing delays in the transport of imported products at the points of exit and entry [37]. ICTs can also help to monitor uncrewed vehicles and agricultural drones that have been suggested as a practice to reduce human contact in agriculture [34]. Value Stream Mapping is another tool that ensures the proper management of the supply chain from farm to fork and the identification of food loss-generating resources [38]. Several companies (e.g., IntechOpen Limited, Creately) have developed related software that offers the visualization of material flow and the monitoring of process steps for producing and delivering products.",

These institutions have relevant knowledge in managing delivery-at-home operations that are highly dependent on volunteer workers. Likewise, they have well-organized delivery routes and networks with farmers associations, retailers, and supermarkets. For example, food banks use apps (e.g., Food Cowboy) to collect unwanted surplus from food services and restaurants.

In particular, one-third (approximately 1.3 billion tn/year, which is equivalent to 3300 Mtn of CO2 emissions/year) of food produced globally is wasted [52]. A more recent estimate suggests that almost 14% of food is lost in stages before the retail level (e.g., agriculture, harvest, slaughter, and catch) [53]. As the global population is about to reach 9.8 billion by 2050 (UN, 2017), food security may decrease, leading to new food crises like the one of 2007\u20132008. Likewise, under these circumstances, people in territories of high population density seek food sources in all kinds of animals and insects. The safety and hygienic conditions of animal-based food sources during retailing and cooking in this kind of big local markets (often selling live animals) are challenging to be monitored by authorities. Cheng et al. [54] suggested that the possibility of the re-emergence of novel viruses from animals or laboratories should not be ignored, because bats comprise a vast reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses. Today, 13 years later, we are facing an outbreak of SARS-CoV2 that has common characteristics with bat coronavirus [3]. Likewise, the first infections occurred in the Huanan Seafood Market [2], where not only seafood, but also live and slaughtered bats, marmots, pheasants, snakes, deer, and organs of rabbits are sold [55]. Regardless of this being a coincidence or not, the world and subsequently the food systems should adapt in the new era of pandemics. There is evidence that the likelihood of pandemics has increased substantially over the past century due to urbanization, global travel, and integration, intensive exploitation of natural resources, and modifications in the use of land [56,57]. As urbanization and global population will increase over the next decades, this trend is expected to continue and intensify [39].",

The current food systems are highly dependent on animal-based protein sources that are not sustainable from an environmental point of view but also form a health and food security perspective. For example, meat consumption is proportional to the amount of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions [59], whereas the consumption of red meat has been associated with chronic diseases like cancer [60]. Besides, the current food systems often have food safety gaps allowing the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms. The increasing demands for proteins, the increasing population, as well as the depletion of resources lead researchers to investigate more sustainable and safer food sources in order to feed the world and meet markets\u2019 needs [61].",

For instance, cockroach milk and cockroach flour may play a pivotal role in the solution to the food shortage in the decades to come ([62,63]. The current trends in alternative protein sources include the dietary shift from beef to poultry and pork (to reduce red meat consumption) [64], new plant-based sources (e.g., quinoa), insects, microalgae [61], and artificial meat that is lab-grown under aseptic conditions. In some cases (e.g., the production of lab-grown meat), there is not enough evidence that the alternative protein sources under investigation are sustainable enough [65]. This status may change in the years to come if the production cost decreases. Besides, some of the alternative protein sources (e.g., microalgae) may also be a source of bioactive ingredients (e.g., polyphenols, flavonoids, lipids, and vitamins) that could be recovered and reutilized in the foreseen growing functional foods sector [61]. Food-processing by-products (from meat or fish processing or the dairy sector) comprise a rich source of proteins and other valuable compounds (e.g., antioxidants) that could be recovered and reintroduced in the food chain [42,46,61,66].",
