In late December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China,\nclusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause, linked to a seafood and animal\nwholesale market there, began to surface. By January 3, 2020, 44 cases were reported\nin China. Chinese authorities isolated a novel coronavirus, on January 7, 2020, and\nshared its genetic sequence on January 12. It was identified in Thailand on January\n13, Japan on January 15, and January 20 in Korea. Deaths were already being reported\nin China. The first case in the United States was reported on January 21, a U.S.\ncitizen who had been in Wuhan. Human to human transmission was suggested by January\n24, and by the 25th it had spread to Australia and France. By January 27 it was\nconfirmed in 11 countries outside of China. On January 30, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 outbreak was a Public Health\nEmergency of International Concern. The first two cases were reported in Italy on\nJanuary 31 (World Health\nOrganization, 2020a). The spread continued, and on March 11 WHO\ncharacterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, acknowledging the disease\u2019s geographical\nspread. On March 16, the total number of cases and deaths outside China surpassed\nthe totals in China. On March 24, 2020, the date of this writing, there are 395,647\nconfirmed cases and 17,240 deaths worldwide (Johns Hopkins University Medicine, 2020).\nThese numbers will certainly be higher at publication.",

Donor milk banking is predicated always on\nthe protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding. We believe\nthis deadly virus is not transmitted through mother\u2019s milk. We do not know if there\nis vertical transmission or not. As of this writing we are beginning to hear reports\nthat the youngest among us may be a high-risk group, as they are with other viruses.\nAs this is a novel virus, we, as a community, have not previously been exposed to\nit. There may not be specific immune factors against it in human milk, yet. But, as\nwe know, there are so many immune factors in, and immune functions of, human milk,\nthat its provision to our youngest and very vulnerable must continue to be of\nparamount importance. We know of one infected mother who had anti-SARS-1 antibody in\nher milk postpartum (Robertson,\net al., 2004). The ability to provide support and to protect our\nbreastfeeding mothers becomes extremely difficult where the virus is rampant. With\nsocial distancing, how do we provide the care, support, and protection these mothers\nneed? In my discussions with my colleagues in Italy and China I heard the angst in\ntheir voices as they lamented their inability to see mothers and babies and provide\nthis most basic of supports. If we cannot support breastfeeding, how will we ensure\na supply of donor milk? In populations with large areas under quarantine or\n\u201clockdown\u201d, how are we to move \u201csafe\u201d milk from the donors to the milk banks? In the\nbigger picture, what does this mean for the health of our children, as we may in\nfact see breastfeeding rates, and the supply and use of donor milk, decrease during\nthis very unstable and concerning of times.",
