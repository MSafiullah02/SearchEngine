Combination treatment with ribavirin and corticosteroids was only started if any of the following occurred: (i) extensive or bilateral CXR involvement; or (ii) persistent CXR involvement and persistent high fever for 2 days; or (iii) clinical, CXR, or laboratory findings suggestive of worsening; or (iv) oxygen saturation (SPO2) < 95% in room air. Ribavirin was given for 10\u201314 days as per protocol at 400 mg every 8 h (1200 mg daily) intravenously for at least 3 days (or until stabilization), then 1200 mg twice daily (2400 mg daily) orally. The corticosteroid regimen was standardized as follows: methylprednisolone 3 mg/kg daily intravenously for 5 days, then 2 mg/kg daily intravenously for 5 days, then prednisolone 1 mg/kg daily orally for 5 days, 0.5 mg/kg daily orally for 3 days and 0.25 mg/kg daily orally in the last 3 days. Additional pulsed methylprednisolone 500 mg twice daily intravenously for 2 days (total 2 g) were given as rescue medication in cases with no response to at least 2 days of a second course of antibiotics to treat possible sepsis; persistent lymphopenia; and deterioration in at least two out of the following three parameters: clinical condition, CXR, and oxygen saturation. After such pulsed therapy, the standard corticosteroid regimen was re\u2010started and tailed down as per protocol. All patients gave verbal consent to the above treatment.",

We therefore think that ribavirin per se is unlikely to be the reason for the satisfactory outcome in our patients. However, the effect of ribavirin in the present study could not be independently assessed because most patients had received both corticosteroid and ribavirin. The utility of corticosteroids in SARS has also been much debated. Activation of the immune system by acute bacterial or viral infection is known to stimulate the production of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids can decrease the release of macrophage\u2010derived inflammatory cytokines,\n22\n and there are anecdotal reports suggesting benefits from high\u2010dose corticosteroids in the management of other viral pneumonitis.\n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n Since the dose regimens employed were dissimilar between series,\n1\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n we believe that differences in timing, dosage and duration of corticosteroid use may account for differences in outcome.\n19\n\n",

The pathogenesis of SARS is proposed to comprise three stages, namely viral replication, lung inflammation and fibrosis.\n6\n Based on this assumption, we speculate that our treatment criteria had enabled our patients to be covered with an anti\u2010inflammatory agent very soon after the onset of immune lung damage. In another series in which a similar combination was started based solely on lack of clinical response to antibiotics after 48 h without explicit radiological criteria, or even earlier if patients had epidemiological history of contact,\n8\n mortality was 7.9% which the authors stated was an underestimation because of sampling bias. The comparatively higher mortality could have reflected an earlier use of corticosteroid without considering clinical indicators of onset of pulmonary immunopathological damage. If this hypothesis is correct, such timing would possibly be still in the pure viral replicative phase in some of the patients, with the possible risk of further increasing the viral load without corresponding beneficial effect on immunopathological lung damage. While nasopharyngeal aspirate PCR status for SARS\u2010CoV aspirate was a predictor of mortality in another series,\n27\n there was no relationship between this status and the time to stabilization in our patients. We therefore believe that appropriate timing of steroid commencement could be a more important factor predicting outcome.",

Another SARS treatment protocol from China using similar high\u2010dose corticosteroids commenced only on worsening of clinical criteria also produced lower mortality than regimens at lower dosages.\n17\n A series in Hong Kong which started treatment with pulse methylprednisolone of \u2265500 mg per day also showed better outcomes than initial non\u2010pulse (< 500 mg per day) methylprednisolone.\n29\n, \n30\n These two series appear to support our hypothesis that high\u2010dose corticosteroids are required at the start of treatment to achieve disease control.",
