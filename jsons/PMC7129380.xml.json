A variety of platforms running over the Internet allows to communicate instantaneously across time zones with friends, family and strangers alike. The way we travel, commute, and communicate is drastically different and more efficient respect to any time in our history [2].",

The comparison between the spreading of the black death in the 14th century and H1N1 in 2009 is particular revealing. The first took over Europe slowly moving from the south as a wave in a medium. The disease reached north Europe in about 2 years. The second instead, spread in 214 countries in matter of few months. Notably its spreading patterns have been seemly erratic and different respect to a wave propagation in space [4], [5]. In particular, the diffusion from one city to another was not simply driven by proximity but by their effective connectivity in the current transportation system [6]. Furthermore, the two diseases induced the proliferation of panic, fear, and behavioural changes. However, in the case of H1N1 people and governments, even those in a particular moment still unaffected by the spreading, were able to follow in near real time the unfolding of the disease and take, often irrational, actions. As this example shows, the complexity of modern mobility and communication introduces non-trivial effects on the spatial unfolding of infectious diseases [7]. Consequently, the development of frameworks able to account and anticipate them has become a fundamental aspect of epidemiology.",

From the number and intensity of contacts between individuals, to the flow of people connecting two cities, the statistical observables of such systems are characterised by heterogeneities encoded in heavy-tailed distributions [1]. The effects of these features on spreading processes unfolding on their fabric, are now well understood [7]. On one side they make systems more fragile. Indeed, the presence of heterogenous connectivity patterns among sub-populations in a meta-population system or among individuals in a contact network lowers the epidemic threshold necessary for an outbreak [9], [10]. On the other, they offer very efficient ways to halt spreading processes. Indeed, heterogeneous connectivity patterns imply heterogenous contributions to the diffusion by the nodes (i.e. sub-populations or individuals) involved. By protecting (immunising) few of them is possible to protect the entire system [11], [12].",

As mentioned above, the spreading of infectious diseases might induce behavioural changes. These could be either imposed by authorities (ban of public gathering, traveling etc.) and or spontaneously emerge as result of concern (precaution) of the population (reduction of contacts, vaccination etc.) [13]. The effects of adaptation on the spatio-temporal patterns of diseases are highly non-trivial and result in a rich phenomenology characterised by multiple peaks in the incidence as well as first order phase transitions [13], [14], [15]. The current communication capabilities have not parallel in history and have great influence on adaptation processes. On one side, these allow people to gather crucial information to protect themselves and their families from risks associated to transmittable diseases [16], [17]. One the other, these allow the spreading of unfounded and unscientific ideas, as for example the link between autism and vaccination, which can have dramatic consequences facilitating the (re)emergence of diseases [18], [19], [20]. As the review note, the role adaptation on the spreading of infectious diseases is a multifaceted subject that, mostly due to lack of real data, is still poorly understood.",
