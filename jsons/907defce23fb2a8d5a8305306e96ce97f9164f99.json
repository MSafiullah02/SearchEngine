One method of categorizing head trauma is by using the initial Glasgow Coma Scale. Minimal head injury corresponds to a score of 15, without loss of consciousness. A score of 14 to 15, with loss of consciousness lasting less than 5 minutes, constitutes mild head injury and no neurological deficit. Those with scores of 13 would be considered In all, 64 hospitals listed which diagnostic criteria they used to define minor head injury. a Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion.
