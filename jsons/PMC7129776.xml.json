The current supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), intensive care unit beds, and ventilators may not be able to keep up with projected demands.2\n,\n4 This nightmare scenario has been experienced internationally, with countries such as Italy and Spain overwhelmed, and looming concerns that this may occur in certain parts of the United States.5 For example, the percentage of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit care has been between 9% and 11%.6 Demonstrating the rapidity of spread, the first recognized case of the pandemic in Italy appears to have been a young man admitted in the Lombardy region with atypical pneumonia on February 20, 2020, and health care resources were overwhelmed within a few weeks.5 The timeline of the Italian experience illustrates a major reason for COVID-19\u2013induced anxiety around the world (Figure 1\n).5\n",

Finding evidenced-based PPE recommendations is difficult; however, over a 2-week span, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention downgraded the COVID-19 risk from airborne to droplet (outside of an aerosol-generating procedure).2 Changing recommendations have been a cause of anxiety for clinicians, compounded by employment termination concerns in some instances for wearing precautionary PPE.",

Questions regarding the ethics of providing care outside of one's scope of practice, and the associated liability, are evolving. The American Medical Association released an update to its code of medical ethics on March 20, 2020, specifically addressing these issues in Opinion 8.3 and Opinions 11.1.2 and 11.1.3.22 These may help provide an ethical backdrop on how to approach such situations, though this still may not do much to leverage preserving one's own wellness and ability to persevere in such circumstances. In New York state, Governor Cuomo has introduced legislation limiting any malpractice liability to physicians practicing outside of their scope, except in cases of gross negligence (which remains nebulously defined).23 However, outside of New York, such liability protection is unclear and may cause justifiable concern.",

Some of these stages may be more identifiable, though loss in the midst of this crisis may be harder to define, and may vary considerably on the basis of personal experiences. When the disease was abroad, there may have been denial/disbelief as to the severity and yearning for limited effects on our society.

Like COVID-19, TB mortality also significantly impacted physicians. It was not until 1882 that Dr Edward L. Trudeau discovered the TB bacterium that caused the disease, and in 1896, when he opened the first sanatorium at Saranac Lake, NY, patients sat outdoors on the wide sun porches to take the \u201cfresh air cure\u201d and receive state-of-the art management of that era.26 Unfortunately, fresh air did not cure TB, and it was not until simple public health social distancing that TB declined sharply in the 1920s and 1930s. The societal struggle with TB demonstrates several parallels with the COVID-19 pandemic. Foremost is the clear and present danger posed by an infectious agent for which curative therapy is currently unavailable and for which only symptomatic management can be provided. This creates challenges to both health and wellness, because fear, anxiety, and frustration can threaten to overtake a rational approach to managing the situation of the moment.",

For example, in the early 1880s, interventions used to treat TB included \u201ccollapse therapies,\u201d in which physicians performed an elective pneumothorax, with the rationale for this procedure being to deprive the aerobic Mycobacteria of oxygen, in an attempt to kill them.27 This procedure involved injecting oxygen or nitrogen into the chest cavity with increasing pressure until the lung collapsed. However, this collapse was not permanent, and it required repeating the procedure every few weeks. It has been estimated that more than 100,000 patients underwent this procedure in the 25 years after this technique was developed, despite the fact that there were no rigorous studies conducted at the time to confirm its effectiveness.28 It was not until 1943 that Albert Schatz discovered streptomycin, which initially proved successful as TB monotherapy, but, over time, combination therapy was required.29 Similarly, trials are actively ongoing to treat COVID-19, including new antivirals, the use of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, anti\u2013IL-6 agents, and the development of vaccines to name just a few.4\n",

In 2020, however, we live in the age of \u201cFakeNews,\u201d and internet users need savviness and knowledge to identify factual information and ignore misinformation.31 The opinions of celebrities, accounts with large numbers of followers, and online influencers are artificially equated with those of actual medical experts. This constant stream of information (and misinformation) can be overwhelming for anyone, let alone clinicians already facing stressful challenges in their professional and personal lives. Before COVID-19, internet addiction was already recognized as a growing problem contributing to social anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other aspects of wellness, which may only intensify during these trying times that are constantly reminding us of the stakes we face.32 During a global pandemic, social media utilization can be beneficial for updates of important information related to current precautions and best practices and provide connections to needed resources. It can also help to connect physicians with loved ones across the globe who are having similar fears and are socially distanced. There are simple, yet effective, strategies that merit review for all medical professionals who use social media in order to maximize benefit and mitigate risk (Table I\n).

Allergy and immunology services such as biologic therapy and immunoglobulin replacement therapy are medically necessary and keep patients out of the emergency department and hospital, potentially saving resources for the care of the COVID-19 patient.40 However, recent guidance has suggested approaches such as telehealth when service reductions are required.4 Appropriate triage during the pandemic allows for effective social distancing; however, economic realities of service adjustments are inescapable, and the consequences of managing reduced revenue will create challenges to staff retention and maintaining a practice.

High-schoolers currently applying to college are concerned because standardized college admissions tests and advanced placement examinations are being canceled, and they are unsure as to how this will affect their college admissions process. Many college students are anxious about whether their summer internships will be canceled, whether graduate degree programs will understand and accept that many colleges and universities are only providing pass/fail grades this semester, and how they will complete courses that depend on face-to-face interactions, which range from the performing arts to chemistry labs. Many seniors are grieving the loss of graduation ceremonies or are worried that their postcollege full-time job offers will be rescinded.

Enjoy nature while maintaining social distances. Take the time to connect with others virtually if you are feeling lonely via phone, email, and video platforms.61 When feeling overwhelmed by the number of people in the house, take some time for yourself in another room or go outside. Use the resources mentioned in this article to get support digitally. If this does not suffice, please reach out for professional help. Supports may be in place from local universities, the American Medical Association, and state and local professional societies. Limiting your news and social media consumption that you find upsetting may also reduce stress. Avoid using alcohol and other drugs to deal with your emotions\u2014instead, use the skills that have enabled you to get through difficult situations in the past.62 Practicing compassion with yourself and others is also helpful.63 Initiating a gratitude practice has been shown to improve a sense of connection, quality, and amount of sleep and has improved well-being.64 This can be achieved through a gratitude journal in which you write daily entries about someone or something you are grateful for or listing 3 good things daily, which has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and improve well-being.65 Engaging in a religious or spirituality practice has been associated with improved coping, strategies of acceptance, and less burnout in internal medicine and pediatric interns.66 Finally, allowing time to debrief, meditate, or discuss challenging situations and grief can be helpful to prevent burnout.67\n",
