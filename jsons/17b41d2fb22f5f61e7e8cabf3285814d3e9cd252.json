            "text": "Impaired vaccine responses in older individuals are associated with alterations in both the quantity and quality of the T-cell compartment with age. As reviewed herein, the T-cell response to vaccination requires a fine balance between the generation of inflammatory effector T cells versus follicular helper T (T FH ) cells that mediate high-affinity antibody production in tandem with the induction of longlived memory cells for effective recall immunity. During aging, we find that this balance is tipped where T cells favor short-lived effector but not memory or T FH responses. Consistently, vaccine-induced antibodies commonly display a lower protective capacity. Mechanistically, multiple, potentially targetable, changes in T cells have been identified that contribute to these age-related defects, including posttranscription regulation, T-cell receptor signaling, and metabolic function. Although research into the induction of tissue-specific immunity by vaccines and with age is still limited, current mechanistic insights provide a framework for improved design of age-specific vaccination strategies that require further evaluation in a clinical setting.

One of the leading causes of hospitalization and death in the aging population is an increase in pathogenic infection (eg, influenza and pneumococcal disease). Moreover, newly emerging pathogens, such as the West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, responsible for the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , show increased disease severity in the older population. 1, 2 This age-related susceptibility to infection is further amplified by an impairment in protective vaccine responses in older individuals-both of which are linked to the erosion of adaptive immune function with age. [3] [4] [5] A major and consistent hallmark of immune aging is the significant alteration in both quantity and quality of the T-cell compartment. Here, we will review the current understanding of how an effective vaccine response is generated and how these responses change with age, discuss emerging mechanisms of T-cell aging that contribute to reduced vaccine responses in older individuals, and explore potential ways to manipulate Tcell responses to enhance overall vaccine efficacy and promote lasting immune protection in the older population.

This immunologic memory is mediated by B and T cells and typically manifests as the presence of antibodies in sufficient concentrations to neutralize the pathogen as well as the rapid effector cell generation when this pathogen is encountered in real life (ie, a ''recall response''). Immunologic memory can last for decades [6] [7] [8] and thus provide lifelong protection against infection. To generate effective immunologic memory in response to vaccination, the specific orchestra of events must occur, starting from naive cell activation to memory cell formation and subsequent long-term memory cell homeostasis (overviewed in Fig 1) . Any alteration in these events, both in quality and/or in quantity, can significantly influence the effectiveness of immune protection elicited by vaccines.",

Indeed, the induction of T FH cells correlates to higher avidity antibody responses after influenza vaccination. 9, 10 In addition to optimizing antibody generation in recall responses, memory T cells can provide primary protection against infection.

After resolution of antigen, 90% to 95% of effector T cells die, with a small subset surviving as long-lived memory T cells. 17, 18 Memory cells provide protection against repeat antigen exposure, due to higher frequency of antigen-specific T cells as well as their poised effector state. In mice, the precursors that eventually differentiate into antigen-specific memory CD8 T cells can be identified at the peak of primary responses by the expression of IL-7 receptor a, while the vast majority of effector CD8 T cells express KLRG1 and are short-lived. 19, 20 Unlike CD8 T cells, definitive markers to identify memory precursors in the CD4 compartment have not been identified. 21 However, CD4 T FH cells use a similar differentiation program as CD8 memory precursor T cells, which involves transcription factor networks of BCL6, TCF1, LEF1, and ID3. This is in contrast to the short-lived effector CD8 T-cell transcription factor network that involves BLIMP-1, RUNX3, and JUN. 22 Recent studies have also shown that decreased CD25 expression by early effector CD4 T cells predicts memory T-cell number in mice 23 and CD39 expression identifies short-lived effector CD4 T cells in humans. 24 Thus, these transcription factors and surface receptors are potential markers for delineating memory precursors and T FH cells from effector T cells.

            "text": "Several factors have been identified that are involved in the pathway decision to develop into short-lived effector versus memory or T FH cells. Strong T-cell receptor (TCR) signal strengths (as measured by CD25 expression) favor terminal effector CD8 T cells, whereas memory precursor CD8 T cells are efficiently generated with relatively weaker TCR signals. 23, 25 Similarly for CD4 T cells, stronger signals appear to favor T H 1 (ie, IFN-g producing) cell development, whereas weaker signals are sufficient to induce T FH and T H 2 cells, 23, 25, 26 although longer dwell times appear to be necessary to develop germinal center T FH cells. 27 In general, the distinction between signal strength and duration of stimulation is difficult in most experimental systems, and at the extreme, sustained stimulation can lead to exhaustion. Costimulatory signals such as CD27 are also required for optimal memory T-cell development. 28, 29 Equally importantly, inflammatory signals induced by the infection or adjuvanted vaccines determine memory T-cell fates. 30 Prolonged exposure to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-2 during priming favors short-lived effector cells through the transcription factors T-bet and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, whereas IL-10 and IL-21 improve memory precursor cell generation through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation. 19, [31] [32] [33] Metabolic programming is another critical determinant of T-cell fate. Upon activation, T cells activate an aerobic glycolysis program that, by providing precursor molecules through the pentose phosphate pathway, supports their massive expansion and their differentiation into shortlived effector T cells. In contrast, memory precursor cells depend on oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Metabolic interference to switch from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration is effective in redirecting T-cell differentiation. Improved memory In the human T-cell repertoire, approximately 1 in every 10,000 naive cells will be a vaccine (VAX)-specific cell. Upon exposure to vaccination, these cells become activated through engagement of their TCR, and other costimulatory receptors, and undergo massive clonal expansion. During this expansion phase, activated naive cells differentiate into short-lived effector cells or memory precursor cells (MPECs). T FH cells are generated, likely in a similar manner as MPECs, and provide critical help to B cells for the generation of high-affinity vaccinespecific antibodies. After resolution of vaccine antigen, most effector cells die. A small subset of MPECs survives to become long-lived memory T cells. These memory cells provide protection against subsequent infection or booster vaccination, possibly for decades, via a higher frequency of vaccine-specific cells, their poised effector state, and potential tissue localization. Recall responses after booster vaccination follow the same scheme, however, starting at higher initial frequency of VAX-specific T cells.",

However, these levels do not always correlate directly with protection against infection. Antibody titers reflect the successful generation of activated B cells and short-lived plasma cells, if measured during the effector phase postvaccination, as well as long-lived plasma cells. Antibody functionality can additionally be determined by assessing the ability of antibodies to neutralize a pathogen, the antibody isotype (ie, IgG, IgA, IgM), and the levels of somatic hypermutation and antibody affinity. These data provide information not only on B-cell responses but also indirect insights into T FH generation and functionality. Additional data are required to gain information on the generation of memory T cells or on tissue-resident T-cell formation that is critical for protective immunity at local tissue sites. Other techniques that are used to get a general idea of T-cell frequency and functionality postvaccination include delayed-type hypersensitivity testing, antigenspecific tetramer staining, ex vivo detection of surface activation markers (eg, HLA-DR, CD38, and inducible costimulator on circulating T FH cells), and in vitro stimulation with vaccine antigens to determine cell proliferation and cytokine production. A marker for the quality of the vaccine-specific memory T-cell response is its polyfunctionality, that is, the ability to coproduce multiple cytokines such as IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-2. 37 Below we discuss the current literature on primary and recall vaccination responses during aging.",

There are few studies on primary responses in humans, making it difficult to study these responses in aging. Early studies looking at primary vaccine responses in humans used a live, attenuated yellow fever (YF) virus vaccine, which is one of the most effective vaccines currently available. These studies demonstrated that older individuals have slower generation of antibodies as compared with young adults, coinciding with higher viremia at 5 days postvaccination. 38 However, by 28 days vaccine-specific antibody levels were similar between age groups and viremia was controlled. A large clinical study similarly found equal titers of YF-neutralizing antibodies 30 days postvaccination across ages. 39 These data suggest that the aging immune system has the potential to develop sufficient primary responses, albeit possibly at a slower rate. Additional YF vaccine studies, however, found that the neutralizing capacity of YF-specific antibodies at peak response (day 14) is lower in individuals older than 50 years, as was the effector response for CD8 T cells, 40 suggesting that although the immune system can respond to develop sufficient immunologic memory for B cells and CD8 T cells, the generation of the effector phase may be compromised in older individuals. Moreover, although CD4 T cells specific to YF had similar frequencies across age, these cells were qualitatively much less polyfunctional in older adults compared with young. YF-specific CD4 T cells also showed significantly less long-term survival with age, implying ineffective development of immunologic memory for CD4 T cells.",

The production of IFN-g, a main effector cytokine, was significantly lower in the older cohort compared with the young, as was IL-10. IL-2 responses were similar between groups, together suggesting that memory T-cell polarization in response to vaccination is altered with age. Thus, from the limited data sets available, it appears that the ability of older individuals to mount primary vaccine responses fails in 3 distinct ways: impaired CD8 T-cell effector responses, reduced CD4 T-cell functionality, and possibly poor memory T-cell maintenance, although this last concept requires further, more detailed study.",

Unlike influenza, VZV infection is a latent viral infection in which immunologic memory, in particular T-cell memory, is required to prevent viral reactivation presenting as shingles or herpes zoster. Unfortunately, immunity acquired naturally against this pathogen breaks down with age. 60 Zostavax (Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ), a live attenuated variant of VZV, was developed to mimic infection and bolster the waning immune memory in older adults. Although it reduces the incidence of herpes zoster by approximately 50% in adults older than 60 years, its efficacy dramatically declines with age, where adults older than 80 years show only 18% vaccine efficacy. 61, 62 Moreover, the immune protection induced by the vaccine diminishes within 8 years after vaccination regardless of age. 63, 64 Thus, Zostavax does not generate robust long-term immunologic memory in older individuals. Somewhat surprisingly, Zostavax is able to generate similar CD4 T-cell responses in young and older individuals. However, the T-cell response reached maximum levels slower with age, 65 in part because of a failure to expand preexisting large VZV-specific CD4 memory T-cell clones. 66 Instead, Zostavax vaccination mostly recruited VZV-specific T cells from the naive repertoire, which in the absence of a booster vaccination may not reach sufficient frequencies to be protective. Moreover, CD4 T cells lose polyfunctional cytokine production with age. 65 Most importantly, age is associated with an accelerated contraction of VZV-specific CD4 T cells immediately after vaccination-induced peak effector responses, 67 possibly due to a preferential generation of short-lived effector T cells. Thus, although Zostavax appears to induce sufficient effector levels, the quality of this response is compromised with age, as is its ability to generate or maintain effective long-term memory T cells. Although Zostavax elicits vaccine-specific antibody production, 68 little is known about how age affects the memory B-cell responses.",

Here, both vaccine antigens induce robust effector responses, reaching similar antibody titers in both young and old adults. 87, 88 However, 5 years after vaccination, more than half (54%) of older adults have lost protective levels of diphtheria-specific antibodies, versus a quarter (24%) of young adults. 87 Conversely, all individuals maintained high protective levels of tetanus-specific antibodies. Tetanus toxoid induces robust CD4 T-cell responses, 89 which could potentially explain differential antibody responses. However, frequencies and functionality of circulating CD4 T-cell recall responses to both tetanus and diphtheria toxoid were similar across age groups. 87 Moreover, the neutralizing capacity of diphtheria-specific antibodies was maintained in older individuals, suggesting sufficient T FH help.

However, this term is misleading if implying that cellular senescence is the major driver of immune aging. 3 Senescence is a cellular state typically defined by an irreversible growth arrest, which impairs cellular proliferation. Immune cell senescence, for example, as a consequence of telomere shortening, 90 could cause poor vaccine responses, because these responses rely on the ability of T and B cells to proliferate. However, as described above and detailed below, T-cell dysfunction with age is not primarily based on an inability of T cells to proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation, but population changes in combination with cellular changes that affect individual steps in the vaccine response. Table I delineates critical steps in the vaccine response and how they could be affected by age-associated defects, starting from a reduced starting pool of vaccine-responsive cells to poor survival of vaccine-specific memory cells. These models are not mutually exclusive, but the defects act in concert, with differences depending on the individual and the vaccine. Below we detail current mechanistic understanding of age-related changes in T cells, as well as discuss those in B cells, that may account for these alterations in older individuals.",

            "text": "Primary vaccine responses in older individuals display features consistent with impaired effector T-cell development, altered effector functionality, and reduced generation of long-term immunologic memory. An overview of known mechanisms that contribute to dysfunctional development of effector and memory responses in naive T cells with age is provided in Fig 2. Antigen-specific naive cell precursors typically range from approximately 1/10 6 to 1/10 5 cells within the T-cell population of adults. 91, 92 Thus, an easy explanation for lower effector cell responses is simply a reduction in naive cells available to participate in vaccine-specific immune responses. Indeed, a key and highly reproducible feature of immune aging is the quantitative loss of naive T cells. [93] [94] [95] This loss is much more prevalent in the CD8 compartment than in the CD4 compartment, in which the starting pool of naive CD8 T cells is lower than that of CD4 in young adults and contraction rates with age are higher. For example, a recent study quantified absolute numbers of naive T cells across age where naive CD4 T cells contracted from approximately 300 to approximately 200 cells/mL in 20-to 70-year-olds, respectively, and naive CD8 T cells contracted from approximately 200 to approximately 50 cells/mL. 95 Whether this contraction alone is sufficient to alter the inherent ability of the naive T-cell repertoire to recognize specific antigens from new pathogens or vaccines as we age is unclear. However, this cellular contraction is in tandem with a significant loss of TCR diversity in both CD4 and CD8 naive compartments. 96,97 A 4-fold contraction in diversity has been estimated with age, from approximately 20 3 10 6 unique receptors in young to approximately 5 3 10 6 in healthy older individuals for both CD4 and CD8 naive T cells, 96 which implies a significant loss of unique antigen-specific naive T cells in older individuals. Consistently, diminished YF vaccine-specific CD8 and CD4 effector responses were found to be highly correlated with baseline frequencies of naive CD8 and CD31 1 naive CD4 T cells, respectively. 40 Collectively, an overall contraction of the naive T-cell repertoire together with lower cell numbers may account, at least in part, for reduced primary vaccine responses, although complete loss of recognition of specific antigens in the human repertoire is unlikely given the extensive diversity and cross-reactivity of the TCR. 98 Although the loss of naive cells could be a potential causative factor in decreased effector responses, a quantitative decrease alone does not account for functional differences observed in effector and memory T-cell responses, as well as in B-cell responses. Consistently, recent studies reveal that naive CD8 T cells not only have decreased survival with age but that they also become phenotypically and functionally distinct from naive T cells in young adults -becoming more epigenetically, transcriptionally, and posttranscriptionally (ie, microRNA [miR]) similar to central memory T cells. 99, 100 This partial differentiation appears to be naive cellintrinsic and distinct from infiltration of the naive compartment with naive-like memory cells, a population that increases in frequencies in older individuals. As humans lose the ability to make new naive T cells via thymic output, 101,102 the cause of this partial differentiation phenotype could be 2-fold: selection of long-lived, more memory-like cells and/or adaptation of naive cells to an aging (and possibility inflamed) tissue environment. The first scenario is intriguing because recent fate mapping studies in mice have found that the naive CD8 T-cell compartment in adults is composed of multiple subsets that have distinct developmental pathways and unique responses to infection. 103, 104 However, mathematically, an adaptation scenario is favored, where cells adapt to their environment, becoming more fit (ie, acquire a survival or proliferative advantage) with age. 105 It is also more consistent with the loss of stem-like features and reduced plasticity we observe in naive T cells in older individuals, 99, 106 and in line with conversion of naive T cells to virtual memory-like cells observed in mice with age. 107, 108 Virtual memory cells are a ''naive'' cell population that acquires features of memory T cells without prior antigenic stimulation, driven instead by cytokine-mediated signaling.",

Moreover, an ageassociated increase in miR-21 expression in naive CD4 T cells sustains the activity of several signaling pathways including AKT-the mammalian target of rapamycin and mitogenactivated protein kinase by targeting their negative regulators, thereby promoting the generation of short-lived effector T cells. 112 In parallel, prolonged activation of AKT results in sustained FOXO1 degradation that impairs the functional activity of lysosomes resulting in impaired proteostasis and the production of B-cell-toxic exosomes. 113 In addition, effector-like T cells express higher levels of the ATPase CD39, and CD39 levels on activated CD4 T cells inversely correlate with the development of influenza-specific memory T-cell responses. 24 Moreover, adenosine generated by CD39 from secreted ATP inhibited TFH development, through negative regulation by BCL6. 114 As CD39 expression on activated CD4 T cells increases with age, it likely plays a role in the impairment of age-related T-memory and TFH responses to vaccination.",

We discuss potential scenarios, not mutually exclusive, for possible loss of vaccine effectiveness in the context of T-cell memory recall below and overviewed in Fig 3. Similar to primary vaccine responses, one explanation for ineffective vaccine recall responses is merely the quantitative loss of memory T cells over time. Indeed, although the relative frequencies of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells increase with age, there is still an overall numerical loss of memory T cells. 95, 125 However, unlike the naive repertoire, memory T cells demonstrate little, if any, loss of TCR richness with age. 96 Instead, an ",

            "text": "A similar finding is observed in response to the influenza vaccine, where older individuals generate multiple influenza-specific CD8 T-cell populations after vaccination but these populations displayed large clonal expansions and distinct TCR usage compared with younger adults. 55, 57 These data demonstrate that memory contraction during aging is insufficient to completely wipe out antigen-specific clones. Moreover, long-lived stem-like memory T cells, which have reacquired a naive phenotype, 126, 127 are relatively maintained across age. 95 However, aging may cause expansion of certain clonotypes that subsequently dominate the immune recall response. Although excessive clonal expansion does not affect the overall phenotype or functionality, which is in contrast to the functional defects of T-cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection, their proliferative potential appears to be compromised. Consistent with this concept, clonal expansion after Zostavax vaccination was inversely correlated with clonal size. 66 Another possible scenario is that the recalled memory cells in older individuals cannot or do not generate functional effector responses. Strikingly, the overall ability of memory T cells to expand postrecall seems relatively similar in numbers to that of young adults across multiple booster vaccines. This is also observed in vitro, with memory T cells from young and old displaying similar levels of proliferation after TCR stimulation. 128 Moreover, aging memory T cells do not have an intrinsically altered ability to produce effector cytokines, including IFN-g, TNF-a, and MIP-1a. 129 This is consistent with both effector memory and central memory CD8 T cells from older individuals displaying intact epigenetic signatures of effector T cells, 99 with recent unpublished data from our group (Hu, Jadhav, Weyand, and Goronzy, 2020) suggesting the same for memory CD4 T cells. If anything, binding motifs to bZIP family transcription factors such as AP-1 or basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor that are important for effector cytokines transcription are more accessible with age. However, many vaccine responses in aging described above found reduced polyfunctional T-cell responses. Loss of polyfunctionality may be a consequence of more progressed or end-differentiation, as indicated by the chromatin state of old central memory T cells or the increased frequencies of terminally differentiated effector memory cells (TEMRAs). 130 An alternative explanation is that memory T cells in older individuals respond qualitatively differently to TCR stimulation than in young. Indeed, similar to naive T cells, memory CD8 T cells display reduced miR-181a, which likely reduces some TCRmediated signals. Interestingly, miR-181a knockout CD4 memory T cells display a preferential selection for higher affinity clones during recall. 111 One could speculate that because TCR affinity has been shown to directly correlate with polyfunctionality, 131 the down-tuning of TCR signaling in aging memory cells may cause selection for high-affinity survival but not have sufficient signaling to maintain optimal, broad polyfunctionality. In addition, the local cytokine milieu may influence polyfunctional T-cell responses in aging. 132 A third scenario is that memory cells demonstrate an effector response similar to young but do not generate or maintain the subsequent memory cells. This concept is similar to that observed in the aging naive compartment, in which naive T cells from older individuals preferentially become short-lived effector cells and not more long-lived memory precursor cells. Consistently, after Zostavax vaccination, VZV-specific CD4 memory cells expanded at a similar rate between young and old; however, there was a more significant contraction of vaccine-specific cells, leading to an overall reduction in VZV-specific memory. 67 CD4 T cells from older individuals also mount similar levels of effector responses against influenza vaccination but contract more, leaving less memory, 133 indicating that memory T cells share a common feature of poor memory development upon recall. This has been confirmed in a study demonstrating that the persistence of memory T H 1-type CD4 to VZV depended on age, whereas initial effector response did not. 134 Mechanistically, effector CD4 T cells derived from the activation of memory T cells of older individuals exhibit altered metabolic function with higher oxidative phosphorylation and increased ATP secretion, 128 which, in conjunction with increased CD39 expression, may affect their long-term survival. Gene expression studies point to the importance of DNA damage responses and cell cycle regulation in the failure of older activated T cells to survive as long-lived memory T cells. 67 Collectively, a similar model emerges for memory recall responses as for primary memory T-cell response; that is, that T-cell aging is associated with a bias to differentiate into short-lived effector T cells rather than T FH or memory precursor cells.",

There is growing evidence that, much like T cells, B cells also become dysfunctional with age. The most common feature of the aging vaccine responses is lower induction of functional vaccinespecific antibodies. Antibody functionality in this context varies but is usually determined by hemagglutinin inhibition assays for influenza, viral neutralization assays for YF, bacterial opsonization for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and antigen-binding antibody levels for most other responses including JEV, VZV, and hepatitis B. The development of protective antibodies requires multiple sequential steps similar to that of T cells and includes naive B-cell activation, cell expansion, and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Moreover, the generation of memory B cells is essential to establish effective protection against subsequent pathogenic exposure. However, the induction of protective antibodies also uniquely requires class switch recombination (eg, the conversion of the B-cell receptor [BCR] from IgM to IgG or IgA isotype) and affinity maturation driven by BCR somatic hypermutation (eg, mutations of the BCR that increase antigen binding).

More importantly, several studies of the adjuvanted vaccine found significant improvement in influenza-related outcomes in older individuals, such as hospitalization due to vascular events or pneumonia, and at least a trend toward reduced incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza. 145, 146 Thus, the defect in vaccine responses seen in older individuals may not be an absolute feature of the aging immune system but a limitation of specific vaccination strategies. Increasing the antigen dose or using adjuvants to delay the clearance of antigen, in conjunction with the increased expression of costimulatory molecules, can overcome defects in T-cell activation and also compensate for lower frequencies of antigen-specific T cells. Booster vaccinations may also be needed more regularly, because larger memory T-cell clones in older individuals have a lower propensity to expand, and recall responses therefore rely on the expansion of infrequent antigen-specific T cells, as in primary responses. Interestingly, Shingrix, a vaccine that is highly efficient in preventing VZV reactivation across age, includes a booster vaccination.",

The nature of the vaccine adjuvant is important in determining the fate of the differentiating T cells, 147 and newer adjuvants may overcome the bias in older individuals to generate short-lived effector T cells in primary as well as recall responses. In the context of HIV vaccination, Cirelli et al 148 have shown the superiority of slow delivery over conventional immunization in inducing more robust T FH -cell responses and germinal center B cells in rhesus monkeys. 148 Moreover, although conventional bolus-immunized animals developed antibodies to nonneutralizing immunodominant epitopes of the envelope protein, slow delivery-immunized animals targeted a more diverse set of epitopes. Although the methods of slow delivery immunization used in this study are not practical for population-wide vaccination campaigns such as those for influenza virus protection, the insights from this study are spearheading new approaches to improve vaccination in the elderly.",

Prolonged activation of the AKT-mTORC pathway favors the differentiation into effector T cells, which can be attenuated by mTORC inhibition. 35 Initial human studies have used the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition via rapalogs in the setting of influenza vaccination, finding increased generation of influenza-specific antibodies postvaccination. 149 Sustained mTORC signaling as well as signaling of mitogenactivated protein kinase in older T cells is due to the overexpression of miR-21, raising the possibility that preventing the upregulation of miR-21 could be a promising avenue to skew Tcell differentiation pathways. Metabolic interference may also be successful to favor generation of memory T cells that rely on oxidative phosphorylation. Indeed, C1q has recently been shown as a mitochondrial activator that suppresses exuberant short-lived effector responses in CD8 T cells. 150, 151 Finally, genetically predisposed, CD39-expressing older individuals suppress T FH generation through the stimulation of the adenosine receptor A2 A R 24, 114 ; in these individuals, interventions to prevent CD39 upregulation or A2 A R signaling in the first 2 weeks after vaccination may be beneficial to improve B-and T-cell memory.",
