As such, extensive diagnostic testing is required to guide treatment and prognostic advice regarding comfort and vision. Previous studies have shown, however, that despite complete systemic evaluation, an underlying cause for anterior uveitis was not found in 60% of dogs1 and 37\u201370% of cats.2, 3 In 1977, Olin examined the diagnostic utility of assessment of protein concentration and microbiologic and cytologic data from aqueous humor samples collected from 17 dogs and 20 cats with anterior uveitis.4 In that study, aqueous humor analysis was beneficial in determining the underlying cause or guiding therapy of uveitis in three of 37 patients; culture of aqueous humor in one dog with a perforating corneal laceration revealed Pseudomonas spp., and cytologic analysis in two dogs led to a diagnosis of lymphoma.",

Antibody production indices (i.e., the Goldman\u2013Witmer coefficient) have been used to document intraocular production of specific antibodies directed against Bartonella spp., feline herpesvirus 1, and Toxoplasma gondii in some animals with uveitis.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 However, these indices do not prove causation because specific ocular humoral immune responses can occur without presence of the organism within the eye. Additionally, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to amplify Bartonella spp., T. gondii, and feline herpesvirus 1 DNA from aqueous humor and blood samples collected from experimental and client\u2010owned cats.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 However, DNA from each of these agents can be present within aqueous humor in the absence of disease so the positive predictive value of these tests is less than 100%. Finally, PCR assessment of antigen receptor arrangement has been developed to aid in the diagnosis of lymphoma,18, 19 but to the authors\u2019 knowledge, it has been reported in only one dog with uveitis.20 Thus, numerous means of assessing aqueous humor exist, but the authors are unaware of any studies assessing correlations among clinical examination findings in dogs or cats with anterior uveitis, cytologic assessment of aqueous humor samples, and results of antibody and PCR assays. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic utility of aqueocentesis and aqueous humor cytologic analysis, along with antibody and PCR testing where available, in dogs and cats with anterior uveitis seen at a single referral hospital over a 27\u2010year period. In particular, we wished to assess correlations between cytologic and clinical assessments of the anterior chamber contents.",

The aqueous humor sample from one dog (C1) contained predominantly eosinophils along with scattered mast cells with cytologic criteria of malignancy and led to a diagnosis of intraocular mast cell neoplasia. This dog also had multifocal recurrent grade III cutaneous mast cell tumors and was described fully in a separate publication.24 Cytologic assessment of aqueous humor from the second dog (C3) revealed a predominantly monomorphic population of immature lymphocytes with large nuclei that were occasionally lobulated or cerebriform and contained frequent mitotic figures (Fig. 1). This dog had bilateral uveitis and was diagnosed with lymphoma solely on the basis of cytologic assessment of aqueous humor. Additional diagnostic testing, including complete blood count, serum chemistry analysis, thoracic radiographs, and abdominal ultrasound, failed to reveal additional organ involvement. The aqueous humor obtained from a third dog (C9), which was ultimately diagnosed with an idiopathic inflammatory neuropathy, was notable in that it contained a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes with many reactive and larger, more immature appearing lymphocytes. This dog was presented with multiple cranial nerve deficits and anterior uveitis OU. Cytologic findings from a CSF sample were similar to those from the aqueous humor sample. Immunophenotyping of the CSF revealed predominantly CD3\u2010positive T cells along with CD79a\u2010positive B cells. Antigen receptor gene rearrangement analysis (PCR molecular clonality testing) on CSF failed to produce an interpretable result. Inflammatory cells were not detected in three dogs (C7, C10, and C12), for two of which (C7 and C12) no clinical diagnosis was ultimately made and one of which (C10) was diagnosed with recurrent grade II cutaneous mast cell tumors. When results of all diagnostic tests were considered, the cause of anterior uveitis was not found in seven of 12 dogs undergoing aqueocentesis. In five of these dogs, cytologic assessment revealed mild to marked lymphocytic inflammation. Neither inflammatory nor red blood cells were detected cytologically in the remaining two dogs (C7 and C12); however, one did have cytologically detectable pigmented cells (C12). Neither clinical anterior chamber findings (flare, cell numbers, hyphema, hypopyon, fibrin, and lipid) nor cytologic grade of inflammatory cell number differed significantly (P = 0.1\u20131.0) between dogs with idiopathic anterior uveitis and those in which a cause was ultimately found.",

The cat that did not undergo infectious disease testing (F1) was diagnosed with idiopathic systemic hypertension. However, signs of breakdown of the blood ocular barrier persisted after the blood pressure was controlled within normal limits prompting aqueocentesis. One cat (F3) was diagnosed with phacoclastic uveitis based on ocular ultrasound and histopathology of the subsequently enucleated eye. The etiologic diagnosis in the remaining three cats was confirmed at necropsy to be FIP (F5 and F9) or presumptively diagnosed as FIP (F2). The presumptive diagnosis in case F2 was based on the cat's age (1 year), history of fever and lethargy, presence of hyperglobulinemia (6.5 g/dL, range: 2.9\u20135.3), and decline in clinical status leading to euthanasia within 5 weeks; however, no necropsy was performed.

This frequency is similar to the only comparable previous report in which aqueocentesis was diagnostic in three of 17 dogs and none of 20 cats.4 These data are corroborated by another retrospective study of feline anterior uveitis in which cytologic assessment of aqueous humor did not correlate with final etiologic diagnosis in 13 of 53 cases.2 A study examining the causes of anterior uveitis in dogs noted that aqueous humor cytology provided an etiologic diagnosis in two of 102 cases; however, the total number of cases that underwent aqueocentesis was not reported.1 These reports may suggest that the diagnostic utility of aqueous humor analysis in dogs and cats is generally low; however, information from the current study suggests that aqueous humor analysis may be highly valuable for diagnosing neoplastic uveitis. Cytologic assessment of aqueous humor was particularly useful for the dog with lymphoma, because all other diagnostic tests failed to produce a diagnosis or reveal evidence of nonocular neoplastic involvement. Ultimately, uveitis was considered idiopathic in 50% of dogs and 56% of cats in the present study on the basis of nonspecific or inconclusive aqueous humor cytologic findings and an absence of specific diagnostic findings on bloodwork, imaging, and infectious disease testing. Although this is consistent with reports suggesting that uveitis is idiopathic in 60% of dogs1 and 37\u201370% of cats,2, 3 selection bias may have influenced results in the present study because aqueocentesis was performed when extraocular testing up to that point had failed to provide a diagnosis. Thus, cats and dogs meeting entry criteria for the present study were more likely to have a form of uveitis in which an etiologic diagnosis was unlikely to be reached or challenging to make.",

            "text": "A major goal of the present study was to examine correlations between cytologic and clinical assessments of anterior chamber contents. We were unable to detect significant correlations between cytologic grade of cell numbers and either clinical grade of aqueous flare or cell numbers within the anterior chamber. Aqueous flare represents clinically detectable concentrations of serum proteins within the anterior chamber and therefore may not be directly correlated with the types or numbers of inflammatory cells that migrate into the same space. However, lack of correlation between cytologic and clinical grading of cell numbers within the anterior chamber is more intriguing. It may be due in part to the somewhat subjective nature of the two semi\u2010quantitative grading systems. Additionally, cells within the anterior chamber may not have been as uniformly distributed as protein such that aspiration of aqueous humor may not have obtained a representative sample. In particular, cell numbers within the anterior chamber would typically be clinically quantified above any area of condensed (i.e., not free\u2010floating) cells, whereas aqueocentesis is typically directed at more condensed regions. By contrast, good correlations were noted between some clinical features and cytologic estimates of specific cell types in the present study. For example, patients with KPs had a significantly higher grade for plasma cell numbers. Although this may be a direct correlation, it is also possible that both the clinical and cytologic findings reflect the duration of the uveitis because some forms of KPs have been associated with chronic anterior uveitis in humans,25 and there was a significant positive correlation in the present study between disease duration and the semi\u2010quantitative grading of plasma cells. This is perhaps predictable because the progression of a primarily neutrophilic inflammatory response to one more dominated by lymphocytes and plasma cells is considered an indicator of chronicity. Not surprisingly, median cytologic grade of erythrocyte number was greater in eyes with clinically detectable hyphema than in those without, and erythrocytes were detected more often on cytologic assessment than by clinical examination. However, erythrocytes were not noted on cytologic assessment of aqueous humor from one cat with hyphema. There are several possible explanations for this: a representative sample of aqueous humor may not have been obtained, the aqueous may have had scant free\u2010floating red cells above the dependent hyphema, or hemolysis may have occurred within the anterior chamber or during sampling and processing. Taken together, comparison of cytologic and clinical estimates of total and individual cell types in the present study suggest that slit\u2010lamp grading of aqueous flare and cell numbers within the anterior chamber should not be used as the sole criterion for determining whether or not aqueocentesis should be performed because cellular aqueous humor samples may be obtained even when clinically detectable cell numbers are low or absent.",

            "text": "In the period since the last report of the diagnostic utility of aqueous humor assessment in dogs and cats,4 the ability to detect host antibodies and pathogen antigens, RNA, and DNA has expanded greatly in veterinary medicine. Despite this, only five patients in the present study had the PCR tests performed, and results of all tests were negative. The low number of samples assessed using molecular techniques may reflect availability of these tests at the time samples were collected because this study describes a 25\u2010year period, some of which pre\u2010date PCR and many of the more current ELISAs. It is also possible that clinicians were not encouraged to submit aqueous humor for testing by ELISA or PCR due to reports of the diagnostic utility of these tests in experimentally infected and naturally exposed animals, especially cats. In the present study, PCR molecular clonality testing was performed in one dog with a predominance of T cells on immunocytochemistry of aqueous humor cytology. Despite this test being previously helpful when run on the aqueous humor from a dog with uveitis,20 in the dog of the present study, the test failed to produce an interpretable result when run on CSF. Unfortunately, the dog's aqueous humor was not similarly tested. Further assessment of molecular clonality testing of aqueous humor in animals with anterior uveitis is recommended, especially in cases such as C3 and C9 presented here, because it may be useful to aid differentiation of inflammation from neoplasia when there are increased numbers of larger, more immature appearing lymphocytes.",

Aqueous humor samples from cats ultimately diagnosed with FIP tended to have mild to marked suppurative or pyogranulomatous inflammation with relatively few large and reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells than did samples from cats in which an underlying cause was not found. However, this was not statistically more likely. Likewise, FCoV RNA was never detected in aqueous humor samples in the present study despite one cat having FCoV RNA in whole blood, a FCoV titer >1:6400, and necropsy\u2010confirmed FIP. This suggests that the inability to detect FCoV DNA in the aqueous humor of a cat should not be used to eliminate the diagnosis. By contrast, FCoV titers were typically very high in cats with necropsy\u2010confirmed FIP in the present study.",
