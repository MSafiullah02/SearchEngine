The substantial growth both in mortgage credit and in housing prices initiated an increase in mortgage delinquencies, as interest rates increased sharply. The burst of the housing bubble and the meltdown of the associated prices triggered a chain of reaction to other financial markets, both domestically and internationally. Asset prices across the globe fell, while financial volatility rose substantially. Among the markets, where prices plummeted considerably, were the housing markets and particularly those that historically have exhibited higher volatility.",

The rationale for testing the particular region is that the Hong-Kong housing market could be considered as an ideal laboratory, based on the robust demand for properties, the relatively low interest rates environment for a long period of time and the large and frequent increases in property prices. More precisely, house prices have tripled in Hong-Kong from 2003 to 2015 while construction surged sharply.",

Moreover, an important discourse in the discussion of the Real Estate market is the relevance of the theory of Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). According to EMH, efficient prices reflect all available information, and follow a rather \u201crandom walk\u201d where it is impossible to make a profit systematically, or above average return (Fama [1], [2]). Put differently, the market is able to absorb the information of yesterday\u2019s price change, without influencing today\u2019s price change, making thus the stock market memory-free. The well-known example in Malkiel [3] of a chimpanzee throwing darts to select a portfolio that would do as well as the portfolio of an expert displays the notion about the EMH.",

According to empirical evidence, levels of inefficiency can be found even in the most competitive markets. Shiller [4] challenged EMH and asked why an efficient stock market should be that volatile, when the actual price should have been the same as the optimal forecast? The dot-com crisis demonstrated that for a short period of time pricing irregularities and predictable patterns can take place. After all, as Grossman and Stiglitz [5] noted, prices cannot reflect all available information, because if they did, there would not have been any incentives for the informed traders to spend their resources to receive compensation.",

Ito and Sugiyama [7] showed that the market efficiency in US stock market is not stable but rather fluctuates through time; it was more inefficient during the late 80s, and became efficient around 2000. Moreover Di Matteo et al. [8] reported an inclination from pure Brownian motion. Eom et al. [9] report a positive relationship between the predictability of the hit rate and the degree of efficiency, concluding that the prediction of future price changes is feasible by using the Hurst exponent as a measurement. Bariviera et al. [10] studied the long varying behavior of sovereign and corporate bond markets of seven EU countries. Using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and the sliding window technique, they report different memory dynamics in bond indices, after the Great Recession.",

In Zunino et al. [14], the complexity\u2013entropy causality plane is used to classify the stage of stock market development. The developed stock markets show higher entropy and lower permutation complexity, while the emergent stock markets behave in the opposite way, with signs of time correlation and inefficiency. Also, Zunino et al. [15] presents a complexity\u2013entropy causality plane for 30 bond indices, a non-exhaustively studied sector.

The establishment of the common currency produced diverse informational efficiency levels among the countries and was negatively affected by the 2008 financial crisis. In Serinaldi et al. [17] the position of chaotic deterministic systems are located in the upper left region of the plane, while the stochastic and noisy signals are closed to the limit point (1, 0). Bariviera et al. [18] use the concepts of permutation entropy and permutation statistical complexity to reveal the temporal correlation of interest rates, and more specifically the Libor rate. Using sliding window to show the evolution of these quantifiers, a complex behavior is revealed, and temporal correlations in Libor rates are shown. Zunino et al. [19] analyzed the efficiency of the European corporate bond sectorial indices before and during the financial crisis of 2007. The sectors that are connected to the financial economy like financial banks, insurance, basic resources and financial services have presented lower informational efficiency. On the other hand, sectors related to the real economy like healthcare, food & beverage and utilities presented less change in the informational efficiency. In Bariviera et al. [20], the efficiency of crude oil market is questioned. The authors concluded that during important economic events the efficiency of the oil has changed. Lastly, several works applied the entropy concept to quantify the efficiency level in various financial markets, Oh et al. [21], Risso [22], Alvarez-Ramirez et al. [23], Martina et al. [24], and Ortiz-Cruz et al. [25].",

By identifying the statistical properties of the housing market indices under stress, we hope to improve our perception about the mechanism behind the dynamics of the real estate market and to develop predictive models for Real Estate price changes. We are studying the informational efficiency level, before and after the financial meltdown of 2007, by using the permutation entropy concept. Different Hong Kong price indices are used based on (a) region namely the Hong Kong Mass, Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, New Territories East, New Territories West, and (b) size like the General Housing price index for overall flat sizes, Large Housing price index and Medium/Small Housing price index. Flats with net floor area over 1076 sq. ft. are included in the large housing price index.1\n",

The estimation of the associated probabilistic distribution comprises as the first step for the calculation of the so-called entropy quantifier, for a given time series. Various methods have been suggested for the estimation of the probability distribution. These methods are, the Fourier analysis, introduced by Powell and Percival [26], the wavelet transformation by Rosso and Mairal [27], the symbolic analysis by Daw et al. [28] and the amplitude statistics (Micco et al. [29]). In our case we utilize the permutation entropy, a procedure introduced by Bandt and Pompe [30] (B&P) in order to construct a probability distribution from a time series. The B&P approach is based on the celebrated Shannon entropic measure, and several applications drawn from scientific disciplines; from medical issues, like observing the results of anesthetic drugs (Jordan et al. [31], Li et al. [32], Olofsen et al. [33], Li et al. [34]), or epileptic seizures (Cao et al. [35], Li and Richards [36], Bruzzo et al. [37]) to various uses refer to astrophysical plasmas (Weck et al. [38]), and financial markets as well. The complexity of arbitrary time series is calculated using an ordinal pattern, and then time causality is assessed from the comparison of the adjacent values. The main advantages of permutation entropy, as set forth by Zunino et al. [13] are its robustness, simplicity, its invariance considering nonlinear monotonous transformations, applicability to any type of time series, the fact that it does not require a large sample size like for instance in fractal analysis, and lastly that it provides a fast computational algorithm.",

The results seem to be independent of the embedding dimension selected for the symbolic reconstruction of the original time series, therefore we focus on D=4. We start our analysis by presenting in Fig. 1, panel (a) and (b), the Shannon Complexity\u2013Entropy Causality Plane (CECP) for all Real Estate indices in Hong Kong, partitioned by size and location. Panel (a) presents the calculated quantifiers of the pre-crisis period based on size indices. All indices before the crisis appear to have higher permutation entropy and lower complexity value, than the quantifiers of the post-crisis period. In particular, prior to the crisis entropy and complexity values range from 0.914 to 0.929 and 0.079 to 0.095 and after the outbreak of the crisis, the quantifiers are 0.878 to 0.91 and 0.095 to 0.126 respectively. It can be concluded that the financial crisis has affected the dynamic structure of the indices, increasing their regularity and predictability. In terms of efficiency, which according to Fama\u2019s sense means that the time series are random, the General index and the Large and Small/Medium size flats indices show a lower efficiency level, during the post-crisis period, compared with the prior period.

Based on the quantifiers, the index for the post-crisis period exhibits higher permutation and lower complexity than the pre-crisis period, signifying that the dynamical structure of the Kowloon index is affected the opposite than the other indices. Likely, the index was not affected by the crisis, evidently by the increased informational efficiency which by the way, is higher than the level before the crisis. A possible explanation of the apparent departure could be found on the following reasons. Kowloon is a major part of the decentralized trend, due to Hong Kong Island\u2019s high prices for office and retail space, and, also, a major recipient of strong demand for residential space manifestly by the major construction projects that took place, especially after the second half of the 2000-decade.",

Considering a 100 weeks window, which corresponds to about 500 business days (or two years) and shifting through the time series with a step of one week, we measure the time variation of both permutation entropy and statistical complexity. This methodology is utilized in order to detect changes in the underlying stochastic processes. For each index the sample size is divided into two periods, with the first spanning from 1998 to 2007, and the second from 2008 to 2017. Fig. 4, presents the entropy complexity causality plane for both Shannon and Tsallis methods, with D=4, for the General, New Territories West and Kowloon indices. Although, both methods behave similarly, clearly, the entropy complexity causality plane discriminates between the two periods, as seen by the different locality of the points. For the calculation of the time evolution of the quantifiers, Kullback\u2013Leibler and Jensen\u2013Tsallis methods were used. Since they offer similar results, we present the Jensen\u2013Tsallis ones. For the first two indices, the after-crisis period show lower permutation entropy and higher statistical complexity, compared to the prior-crisis period, while the opposite emerges for the Kowloon index. The Kowloon index exhibits greater degree of randomness, since the outbreak of the crisis, consistent with a totally random stochastic process.",

On the other hand, Hong Kong and New Territories East index give similar results too. In this case we take into consideration the former one. Lastly, Kowloon index is one trend of its own. Furthermore, all Tsallis entropy results for each index for every q\n(q=1.4,1.45,1.5) behave in the same pattern, therefore q=1.5 is selected. Both methods exhibit similar fluctuations in permutation entropy values. The results of the two methods confirm what we have observed in the previous Fig. 4: before the crisis the entropy values are higher and around at the beginning of 2008 they start to fall significantly. The information efficiency, based on the quantifiers seems to decrease in value after the outbreak of the crisis, for most of the indices except the Kowloon index. The upward trend of the informational efficiency, since the outbreak of the crisis could be explained firstly, on Hong Kong\u2019s government intention to transform Kowloon into a second Central Business District (CBD). Secondly, on the increasing inflow of investors\u2019 capital from Mainland China to Kowloon housing market, due to hedging against RMB depreciation (Hui et al. [49]), and because they consider Kowloon area as a strategic gateway. Lastly, people are moving out of CBD of Hong Kong for less expensive real estate areas (CBRE 2012).",

Another event generating lower entropy value, magnifying the impact of the financial crisis was the resignation of five Hong Kong members of the Parliament, in January 2010, demanding more civil liberties.
