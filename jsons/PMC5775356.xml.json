Epigenetic modifications of chromatin regulate heritable and reversible gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, and can also modify chromatin accessibility. DNA methylation and post-translational histone acetylation and methylation are major mechanisms responsible for epigenetic regulation of gene expression1. DNA methylation typically represses gene transcription when takes place in the promoters of regulated genes2. Histone acetylation opens the condensed chromatin structure by reducing DNA affinity for histones; this enables the DNA to uncoil from nucleosomes so that transcription factors and RNA polymerase can access the DNA and increase transcription3. Histone methylation can increase or decrease gene transcription, depending on which amino acids in the histones are modified and how many methyl groups are added to specific residues4.",

The heterotrimeric viral polymerase synthesizes capped, polyadenylated viral mRNAs through an initiation process; it uses short-capped oligonucleotides as primers, which are scavenged by a viral endonuclease from newly synthesized host RNA polymerase II transcripts5,6. The viral transcription strategy thus requires continuous cellular transcription for viral mRNA synthesis. This mechanism implies functional association with host genome expression, and thus depends on chromatin dynamics. Despite this requisite, once viral transcription is complete, cellular transcription is no longer needed and the virus efficiently switches off host mRNA synthesis through a complex interplay of processes7. The infected cell in turn initiates an antiviral response to counterattack the infection by inducing different pathways, among them the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) response. Hundreds of ISGs with antiviral and immune modulatory functions are transcribed after influenza virus infection8. During infection, host cell chromatin dynamics must respond to various situations, to increase or reduce expression of specific genes that adapt the infected cell for the host:pathogen confrontation at each replication.",

At 8 h post infection (hpi), DNA was isolated and methylation profiles evaluated in triplicate using the 450 K Infinium DNA Methylation BeadChip. Correlation analysis of the 444,751 valid probes showed an extremely strong relationship between samples (Pearson correlation coefficient from R2 = 0.9945 to R2 = 0.9960; Fig. 1B). To identify specific differentially methylated candidates, we performed a parametric analysis to compare average beta values from infected with mock-infected cells, selecting those with differences in methylation levels >25 (\u22120.25>delta>0.25) and a standard deviation value <10% (Desvest<0.10). We found no significant variations, even after analysis of selected CpG sites from infection-associated genes (not shown), which indicated that global methylation of DNA does not change during influenza virus infection in this system.",

We used unbiased analysis with the nanoLC-MS platform to identify and quantify influenza virus-induced epigenetic changes in histone post-translational modifications (PTM). Three biological replicates were analyzed and quantitative analyses completed (see Methods). We considered a Mascot score threshold of 25 as high-confidence peptide identifications, and all peptides methylated/acetylated on lysine (above or below this threshold) were validated manually to assure correct tandem mass spectra matches. Only PTMs that were present in at least two replicas are presented (Fig. 1C) and it has to be pointed out that all modified and unmodified peptides were identified reliably more than once. Results in infected cells showed a reduction in lysine acetylation of histone 3 and 4. This decrease would impair host cell expression, in accordance with the role of acetylation in opening the condensed chromatin and activating transcription17. Non-methylated H3K36 and non-acetylated H4K79 levels increased moderately during infection; since H3K36 methylation and H4K79 acetylation are hallmarks of transcription elongation18,19, the increased levels of these unmodified residues would also contribute to transcriptional inactivation of host cells.",

Lysines not detected by MS include H3K4 and H4K20, whose PTM are recognized as histone marks that control cell transcription. H3K4 trimethylation is a common modification in active chromatin20, whereas H4K20 methylation is linked to transcriptional repression20,21. Decreased H3K4me3 levels have been observed during influenza virus infection16; here we evaluated possible changes in methylated H4K20 and in acetylated H4K16, as the latter is a conventional histone marker of active chromatin22. Total extracts of A549 mock-infected or PR8hv-infected cells at high m.o.i. were collected at various times post-infection and levels of acetylated H4K16 and dimethylated H4K20 were tested by Western blot. The results indicated that at late times after infection, influenza virus triggers a decrease in H4K16ac and an increase in H4K20me2 (Fig. 1D), which could contribute to a general decrease in host cell transcription activity.",

As methylation of this lysine gave the highest score in MS analysis, we evaluated this increase by two additional methods. We purified histones from cells mock- or PR8hv-infected at high m.o.i.; at 8 hpi, H3K79me2 levels were evaluated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1E) and a quantitative colorimetric method based on anti-H3K79me2 antibody detection (Epigentek) (Fig. 1F). Both techniques verified the H3K79 methylation increase observed in proteomic analysis.",

Influenza virus infection increased IFN\u03b2, ISG56 and Mx1 production in MDCK control cells, and inhibitor treatment reduced their accumulation (Fig. 7C, top). Infection of MDCK V2 cells increased IFN\u03b2 production, which was reduced by Dot1L inhibitor, whereas accumulation of ISG was not observed, in accordance with the need for STAT signaling for their induction (Fig. 7C, center). Infection of MDCK Npro cells did not increase IFN\u03b2, ISG56 or Mx1 RNAs, independently of the presence of Dot1L inhibitor (Fig. 7C, bottom), which coincided with the inability of these cells to produce IFN and ISG. In addition, total extracts of MDCK, MDCK V2 and MDCK Npro cells infected with PR8hv at 3 m.o.i for 8 h were used for Western blot analysis to detect IRF-3, STAT1, Mx and ISG56 to confirm the differential expression of these proteins in normal or IFN-deficient cells (Fig. S2B).",

Consequently, during infection there is a network of viral- and host-induced modifications of cellular gene expression with a close dependence of chromatin-based functions and therefore of chromatin dynamic. Accordingly, specific interactions between chromatin remodelers of the CHD family and influenza virus proteins have been described such as the association of CHD3 with the non-structural protein NS237 or CHD6 and CHD1 with the viral polymerase complex16,38,39.

NF-\u03baB and IFN regulatory factor 3 direct expression of type I IFN, which promote transcription of a variety of genes that further limit viral replication45,47. We observed a marked increase on replication of influenza virus and VSV, both potent inducers of IFN, in cells with low levels of methylated H3K79 (Figs 2, 3 and 8).
