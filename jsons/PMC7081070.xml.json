            "text": "Coronaviruses, a genus in the family Coronaviridae, are large, enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses, 27.6\u201331 kb in length, responsible for highly prevalent diseases in humans, birds and domestic animals. The one-third 3\u2032 section of the genome contains ORFs encoding the major structural proteins, spike, envelope, membrane, haemoagglutinin-esterase and nucleocapsid proteins. These ORFs are interspersed with several ORFs encoding different non-structural proteins, most of which have unknown functions (Lai & Holmes, 2001; Pratelli, 2006, 2011). In rooted trees, the members of the coronavirus genus consistently form three distinct monophyletic groups, referred to as phylogroups 1, 2 and 3. Canine coronaviruses (CCoVs) are included in phylogroup 1. In view of the recent increase in the number of newly discovered coronaviruses, and ensuing debates and confusion in the literature concerning coronavirus taxonomy, the unofficial, but widely accepted, nomenclature has been proposed to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Executive Committee, and phylogroups 1\u20133 were converted into genera designated Alpha-, Beta- and Gammacoronavirus, respectively (Pratelli, 2011). Deltacoronavirus is a new genus proposed in July 2013 (ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp) (Table 1).",

Lipid rafts, enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol and associated proteins, play a critical role in different biological aspects of the life cycle of several viruses, and are involved in many processes in viral infection. In particular, the tight packaging of the sphingolipids is maintained by the presence of cholesterol, a major constituent of the lipid rafts, and several proteins partition into these membrane domains (Imhoff et al., 2007). Extraction of cholesterol destroys this order, leading both to disorganization of the lipid raft microdomains and to the dissociation of proteins bound to the lipid rafts (Barman & Nayak, 2007).",

Successful entry of enveloped viruses requires binding to specific cellular receptors and fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane. Accumulating evidence suggests that enveloped virus entry may require cholesterol in either, or both, of the two membranes involved. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection requires cholesterol both in the target cell membrane and in the viral envelope (Guyader et al., 2002; Liao et al., 2001, 2003). Cholesterol in both membranes is also required for bovine herpesvirus 1 infection of Madin Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells (Zhu et al., 2010). For other viruses in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae of the family Herpesviridae, such as herpes simplex virus 1, varicella-zoster virus and porcine pseudorabies virus, cell membrane cholesterol is required during virus entry (Bender et al., 2003; Hambleton et al., 2007; Desplanques et al., 2008). Other viruses are sensitive to cholesterol depletion from the cell membrane, such as Semliki Forest virus, murine leukaemia virus, Ebola virus and Marburg virus (Ahn et al., 2002; Bavari et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2002; Phalen & Kielian, 1991). For influenza virus and duck hepatitis B virus, the presence of cholesterol in the viral envelope is critical, but it is not essential in the target cell membrane (Sun & Whittaker, 2003; Funk et al., 2008), and recently it has been demonstrated that canine distemper virus also requires cholesterol in the viral envelope (Imhoff et al., 2007). In contrast, in the case of vesicular stomatitis virus, replication is not affected by cholesterol depletion, and numerous strains of the family Flaviviridae, i.e. dengue virus and yellow fever virus, enter and infect cells independent of cholesterol (Umashankar et al., 2008).",

In the case of enveloped viruses, viral nucleocapsid is surrounded by a lipid membrane derived from the infected cell, where glycoproteins are fixed supporting the functions of entry into target cells and/or fusion between viral and cell membranes. The lipid composition of animal membranes is complex, and three main categories of lipids can be distinguished: glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and sterols. Sphingolipids are main components of animal cell membranes, and sphingomyelin at the plasma membrane is known to be enriched in lipid microdomains forming the so-called lipid rafts, together with cholesterol (Blaising & P\u00e9cheur, 2013). These lipids contribute to viral infection by modulating the properties of viral and/or cell membranes during infection, and can thus play a role through their preferential partitioning into the membrane microdomains. Specifically, viral entry brings together virions and host cells that will interact in a subtly controlled step-by-step process. Each step, therefore, relies on a paired combination of lipids and proteins (Blaising & P\u00e9cheur, 2013).",

In particular, lipids are essential for the life cycle of several coronaviruses. The depletion of cellular cholesterol inhibits entry of MHV (Thorp & Gallagher, 2004; Choi et al., 2005), SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2007; Glende et al., 2008), HCoV-229E (Nomura et al., 2004) and IBV (Thorp & Gallagher, 2004; Nomura et al., 2004; Li et al., 2007; Imhoff et al., 2007). Ren et al. (2008) showed the importance of cholesterol in both the cell and viral membranes for TGEV infection, and in addition a functional analysis suggested that cholesterol depletion affects a post-adsorption step in the TGEV entry process (Yin et al., 2010). Therefore, the importance of cholesterol-rich microdomains appears to be a general feature of the entry mechanism of different viruses and, as far as coronaviruses are concerned, the purpose of this study was to analyse the contribution of lipids in the infectivity of CCoV, and in particular whether cholesterol was important as a constituent of the virus, the host cells, or both. The CCoV life cycle appears to be closely connected to plasma membrane cholesterol. In the case of TGEV and HCoV-229E, the cholesterol dependence is consistent with the presence of porcine and human aminopeptidase N, respectively (Ren et al., 2008). Conversely, MHV and SARS-CoV use different receptors, MHVR and ACE2, respectively, which are non-raft proteins (Thorp & Gallagher, 2004; Warner et al., 2005).Our analysis did not provide evidence that the activities of the S protein, binding to sialic acids and to aminopeptidase N, were reduced in cholesterol-depleted virions. However, optimal infectivity of CCoV requires cholesterol in the plasma membrane. In particular, cholesterol depletion resulted in a reduction, but not abolishment, of virus infectivity, and virus entry may occur also at lower cholesterol levels, but increased cholesterol makes this process more efficient. At a concentration of 700 \u00b5g ml\u22121, infectivity was restored to an average of 77 % compared to the mock-treated cells, confirming that the reduction was due to the cholesterol depletion, and that the inhibitory effect was partially reversible.",
