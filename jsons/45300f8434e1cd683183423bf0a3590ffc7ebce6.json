Only cuffed non fenestrated tracheostomy tubes are positioned.During surgery we wear enhanced personal protection equipment (PPE), which comprised standard PPE plus the use of shoe covers and a helmet with positive air-powered respirator to provide a complete barrier from the patient's respiratory droplets.",
