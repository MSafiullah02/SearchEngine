For emerging viral infections, antiviral therapies are a key medical countermeasure because vaccine production takes months or years, whereas effective antiviral medications may already exist. For COVID-19, the potential of several existing medications (including remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab) is of interest. During the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, there was interest in neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) as anti-influenza agents, although adequate safety and efficacy data supporting their use were lacking. This evidence has now substantially strengthened 2 however, much of this was generated after the pandemic. There has been no quantitative assessment of the volume and quality of information that is produced regarding treatments during the pandemic period. This data is important, because it represents what is available to clinicians making treatment decisions for patients under conditions of significant uncertainty, 3 and during surging patient numbers. 4 The objective of this systematic review is to investigate how safety and efficacy data for treatment of A(H1N1)pdm09 accrued during the pandemic (see table 1 ). We review the quantity and timing of publication of clinical trials of treatments, but also information where patients were treated outside a formal trial setting (case studies or series, and observational studies), or when research was registered but not completed, as these may represent both the best quality evidence available at the time, and also opportunities lost to gather high-quality evidence.",

To capture information on how many patients received treatment outside of a trial, we included case studies, case series, and observational research in addition to interventional research. The single exception was to limit descriptions of the use of oseltamivir to publications with ten or more patients, because case reports were abundant. We included research that described hospitalised patients and reported acute clinical outcomes (defined as length of hospitalisation, intensive care admission or length of stay, medical complication, requirement for mechanical ventilation, or mortality). We included patients with only laboratory confirmed disease. While A(H1N1)pdm09 was the prevailing strain during the outbreak, inconsistencies in defining probable cases between papers meant a consistent inclusion method a was otherwise not possible. We included papers only if enrolment opened between April 1 2009 (when the virus strain was first identified) and was completed by August 10 2010 (the declaration of the end of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern [PHEIC]) by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This limitation was necessary to differentiate research conducted specifically for the pandemic, compared with routine seasonal influenza reporting once A(H1N1)pdm09 became a seasonal strain. These criteria did not apply for clinical trials (where there could be no confusion with seasonal reporting).",

This suggests that platform trials should be adopted as a way to expedite outbreak research. Using this approach, multiple treatments (or even multiple respiratory viruses) can be evaluated under an overarching protocol and regulatory framework, improving efficiency. 14 Sleeper protocol research may also provide a solution. These pre-prepared and pre-approved protocols can lay dormant, waiting for cases of pandemic respiratory viruses, and allow prior assessment of the logistics and feasibility of the protocol. An example of this type of protocol exists in for severe acute respiratory infections (NCT02498587), and has been used to rapidly enrol patients with COVID-19.",

It has been estimated that a sample size of 800 patients is required to power a randomised controlled trial of an NAI in hospitalised patients. 18 No prospective research identified here was that large. Beyond the benefits of increased enrolment and external validity, multicenter research has specific advantages in epidemics. It can compensate for unexpected variations in epidemiology at the regional level (such as the sudden end to the EVD outbreak in Liberia that prematurely halted a clinical treatment trial) 19 or the temporary closure of health care facilities with nosocomial transmission (such as occurred during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak of 2003). 20 We report long delays between clinical data capture and publication in the peer-reviewed literature. This is consistent with analyses for other disease outbreaks, including epidemiology reporting for SARS (where only 7% of articles were published within the timeframe of the epidemic) 21 and randomised controlled trials of pandemic H1N1 vaccines (where only 29% of clinical trial results were published almost a year following the end of the pandemic). 22 The present WHO standard for interventional clinical trials is that main findings are to be submitted for publication within 12 months of study completion 23 and although no analogous guidelines exist for observational clinical data, there are analogous scientific and ethical imperatives for timely reporting.",

For example, observational data must be accrued to design interventional trials (such as approximating the type and rate of outcomes). Emerging evidence can also prioritise trials so that the most promising continue recruitment when there are a declining number of cases late during an outbreak. 25 Initiatives to minimise publication delay now include fast-track review for manuscripts likely to change clinical practice. 26 Pre-approval of trial protocols and results-free review (where initial review excludes results and some discussion) are models which may assist in timely reporting. There is also support for pre-publication online release of preliminary findings. Indeed, the increasing utilisation of pre-publication servers (such as medRxiv) has been reflected in the COVID-19 outbreak. Dissemination of research findings via pre-publication (prior to peer-review) reduces delays, but carries risks for validation of methodology, accuracy of data, and interpretation of findings. The extraordinary number of COVID-19 articles being submitted to pre-publication servers 28 has led to a rapid, open, peer-review platform for COVID-19 preprints, 29 in an attempt to improve quality control.",
