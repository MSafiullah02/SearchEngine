            "text": "Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a non-enveloped, multi-layered, double-stranded RNA virus in the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae, one of the largest families of viruses including major human pathogens (e.g., rotavirus) and other vertebrate, plant and insect pathogens. BTV is transmitted by biting midges of Culicoides, including C. variipennis and C. imocola (Mellor, 2000). BTV replicates in both vertebrate and insect hosts, causing diseases in wild ruminants and economic important animals including sheep, goat, cattle and other domestic animals around the world (Mellor, 2000, Mellor and Wittmann, 2002), with $3 billion/year loss worldwide (MacLachlan and Osburn, 2006, Mellor et al., 2008). Due to its economic significance, BTV has been the subject of extensive molecular, genetic and structural studies and now represents one of the well-characterized viruses.",

Currently, vector control and vaccination using BTV virus-like particles are two main prevention strategies being implemented to prevent the possible BTV epidemics (Blair et al., 2000, Travanty et al., 2004). However, such strategies have been demonstrated to be insufficient due to the changes of vector habitats and new virus strains. The 1998\u20132001 outbreak of BTV in the Mediterranean Basin was the greatest epizootic of the disease on record, showing that BTV had extended its range northwards into areas of Europe that were never affected before and has persisted in many of these locations (Meiswinkel et al., 2008). This epidemic has been linked to the recent distribution extensions of its major vector, C. imicola, the involvement of novel Culicoides vector(s), and an apparent ability of the virus to overwinter in the absence of adult vectors (Mellor et al., 2008, Mellor and Wittmann, 2002). Thus, it is urgent to develop effective antiviral drugs against BTV infection to avoid possible epidemics.",

CPE is evident in BTV infected vertebrate cells, such as HeLa, BSR, and HEK 293T, including both the biochemical and morphological hallmarks of apoptosis (caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing and cellular shrinkage) (Li et al., 2007). BTV-induced CPE and/or apoptosis could be monitored using different CPE and apoptosis detection methods, which make the development of a robust and reliable assay possible. Here, we present the development of a robust and reliable CPE-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for antiviral drug discovery against BTV infection, and the identification of novel antiviral compounds that protect host cells from BTV infection.",

Characteristics of apoptosis and CPE, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and DNA fragmentation, have been shown and the apoptotic pathway has been elucidated (Li et al., 2007, Mortola et al., 2004, Nagaleekar et al., 2007). The quantitative analysis of the CPE induced by BTV infection was shown here using 96-well plate. BSR cells were seeded with a density of 15 000 cells/well, and infected with BTV at different MOIs, 0.5, 1.0 and 10, respectively. At different hours post-infection (h.p.i.), BTV-induced CPE was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability kit, a homogeneous method of determining the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, which signals the presence of metabolically active cells. The single step \u201cadd\u2013mix\u2013measure\u201d format resulting in cell lysis and the generation of luminescent signals is also ideal for future large scale HTS of various compound libraries. While there was no significant decrease of cell viability in BTV infected cell at 24 h.p.i., a two-fold decrease of cell viability in BTV infected cells was observed in all three MOIs at 48 h.p.i. The decrease of cell viability was much more apparent at 72 h.p.i., with 9.7-, 12.0- and 11.7-fold decreases, i.e. S/B ratio, for MOI of 0.5, 1.0 and 10, respectively (Fig. 1\n). This result showed that BTV infection induced CPE can be quantitated, especially at 72 h.p.i. with remarkable high S/B ratios. Meanwhile, this single step CPE-based assay will be suitable for future HTS assays, although further optimizations were necessary to improve this CPE-based assay into a primary HTS assay.",

It has been shown that high DMSO concentrations (>1%) have dramatics effect on membrane permeability, cell viability and virus infection in MDCK cells (Irvine et al., 1999, Noah et al., 2007). Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of DMSO on cell growth and cell viability of BSR cells. After being seeded in 96-well plates at 15 000 cells/well, BSR cells were treated with DMSO at different concentrations, ranging from 0.02% up to 2% (Fig. 2\n). After 72 h incubation, cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo reagent. The effect of DMSO on cell viability was compared between the cell viability in DMSO treated cells relative to cell viability in cells that were not treated with DMSO. When BSR cells were treated with DMSO at 1% or lower concentration, there were no decreases on the cell viability. In contrast, there was a slight increase of cell viability, ranging from 5% to 12%, when cells were treated with DMSO concentration below 1%. However, when cells were treated with 2% DMSO, there was 28.9% decrease of cell viability, a considerable decrease comparing with cells without DMSO treatment (Fig. 2). This result supported that the designated 0.6% DMSO concentration for our HTS campaign will be suitable for the screening. Meanwhile, there should be no more than 1% DMSO added to the cell culture for the entire screening when using this assay.",

Two different FBS concentrations, 5% and 1% in DMEM media, were evaluated at different seeding cell densities. At both concentrations, seeding density at 7500 and 10 000 cells/well showed similar pattern and the decreases of cell viability were observed at 72 h post-seeding.

Further observation showed that at even lower MOIs, CPE was also obvious (results not shown).

To determine the Z\u2032-value, the CPE-based assay in 384-well plates was run at three different days and three different assays, at the optimized conditions including cell density at 5000 cells/well, 1% FBS media, BTV infection at MOI of 0.01 and final luminescent signals read at 72 h.p.i.

The Z\u2032-value analysis was performed repeatedly to demonstrate reproducibility. We obtained an average Z\u2032-value of 0.70 \u00b1 0.01 under the optimized assay condition using the formula in Section 2.9 (Zhang et al., 1999).

The examination of intra- and inter-run variations, including well to well, plate to plate, and day to day variability, were carefully evaluated by running three Z\u2032 plates on three separate days for a total of nine plates, determined that the assay was sufficiently robust to screen a large compound library.

These compounds were selected based on their physico-chemical properties with cutoffs applied, including MW < 1000, cLogP < 5, HBA < 20 and HBD < 10. All compounds were screened once at 10 \u03bcM using the validated CPE-based assay in six separate runs under the exact optimized experimental conditions.

The assay robustness, including the average Z\u2032-value and S/B ratio were graphically illustrated in Fig. 5\n. The average Z\u2032-value for the entire screening was 0.70 \u00b1 0.06 (Fig. 5a), which matched to the Z\u2032-values obtained from the duplicated validation screenings. The average CVs were 4.63 \u00b1 1.31 for cells only and 10.50 \u00b1 3.54 for virus infection only (results not shown).

            "text": "CPE is a general term used to describe the adverse effect on the cells post-viral infection. CPE involves at least two distinct processes: necrosis and apoptosis. Various assays are available to distinguish these two mechanisms through measuring a variety of different markers that indicate the number of dead cells (cytotoxicity), the number of live cells (viability), and the mechanism of cell death (apoptosis). Most conventional cell-based antiviral drug screening assays were developed based on the cell viability assay (ATPase, kinase and cytotoxicity). The introduction of CPE-based assay using ATP/luminescence readout, such as CellTiter-Glo reagent, has been recently reported, which made the HTS against large compound library possible in several different antiviral assays, including the antiviral HTS assays against influenza virus (Noah et al., 2007, Severson et al., 2008), SARS-CoV (Severson et al., 2007), Yellow fever virus (Gong et al., 2008), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Paragas et al., 2004). Our CPE-based antiviral assay against BTV also showed its feasibility with the \u201cmix and measure\u201d one step protocol, and flexibility with stable luminescent signals. Meanwhile, toxic compounds that reduced the cell viability were also excluded in this CPE-based assay. This CPE-based assay was also easy to be adapted and validated in HTS Center, making it possible to screen large compound libraries, such as MLSMR collection. This assay may also be used for assays based on CPE induced by other reoviruses and arboviruses.",

Typically, a S/B ratio greater than 5 is an adequate detection window, and the Z\u2032-value >0.5 are considered robust enough for a HTS assay (Zhang et al., 1999). The duplicated validation screening of the CPE-based assay using the 9532 testing compound library, and the primary HTS assay against MLSMR further demonstrated the assay was sufficiently robust and reproducible for a HTS platform with very similar statistical assay performance values, including Z\u2032-value between 0.70 and 0.71, CV for the cell control between 4.52% and 5.94%, and S/B between 4.49 and 7.56 (Table 1). CV from the virus infected control was higher than 10%, which is natural for the virus infected cells due to the complexity nature when virus infection process. The S/B ratio form one of the validation screenings was 4.49, lower than 5.0 as requirement, however, the consistent Z\u2032-value from the validation screenings indicated that this assay was robust for using in HTS. Indeed, similar Z\u2032-values, CV and S/B ratio were also obtained for these assay parameters in our primary HTS, which further demonstrated that the assay is reproducible and reliable.",

BTV is the prototype virus in the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae. BTV is considered to be one of the most important diseases of domestic livestock, and has been a subject of intense molecular study for the last three decades and is now one of the best understood viruses at the molecular and structural levels (Mellor et al., 2008, Roy, 2008). As a member of reoviruses and arboviruses, BTV must be capable and should be sufficiently flexible to allow its replication in evolutionarily distant hosts, which also applied to other reoviruses and arboviruses including members in the families of Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Reoviridae. Since antiviral compounds identified here could protect host cells from BTV-induced CPE responses, these compounds might also protect host cells from other reoviruses and arboviruses infections. Meanwhile, any compound identified using this assay could be used as a chemical probe to further study the virus\u2013host interactions. Thus, our developed HTS assay will be of direct benefit to the drug development and drug design to counter reoviruses and arboviruses diseases, thereby have a positive impact on the widespread burden of these diseases.",
