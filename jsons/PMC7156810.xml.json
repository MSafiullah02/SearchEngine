Tumor necrosis factor blockers carry a black box warning concerning infection. Ustekinumab showed a small increase in overall infections but not in respiratory tract infections. Ustekinumab blocks interleukin (IL) 12 and IL-23; IL-12 plays an important role in fighting viral infections.1 IL-23 blockers showed increases in overall infections of up to 9%, but upper respiratory infections were increased slightly in some trials but not in others. IL-17 blockers showed increases in overall infections of up to 11%, but much of that increase could be accounted for by increases in monilial infections. Upper respiratory infections were increased slightly for secukinumab, but not for ixekizumab or brodalumab.",
