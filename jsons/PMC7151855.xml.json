Some of these are located on critical care units, others in the operating suites, and others in the ED. If patients come to a hospital with syndromes of illness that progress to respiratory failure or other conditions that require intubation and ventilator therapy, what would be the triage procedure for determining which patients would receive a ventilator versus which patients would not? This question is particularly salient in the setting of pandemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other emerging infectious disease threats, including those from bioterrorism.",

Conceivably the astute clinician would be able to prevent the need for some patients to be intubated by using aggressive medication therapy, and the use of noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)- or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP)-type devices. However, as with all scarce resource events, there is inevitably a tipping point where demand exceeds availability and physicians will need to provide supportive therapy only to a certain subpopulation of patients, while placing others on ventilators. This decision is one that should be supported by clear guidance that is medically sound, ethically appropriate, and legal defensible.",

            "text": "Acute care hospitals may have one or more critical care inpatient units. This may vary in sophistication from a single intensive care unit (ICU) within a small community hospital to a number of ICUs and intermediate care units in larger tertiary medical centers. Typically, due to the severity and clinical acuity of the patients admitted to these units, the patient-to-staff ratios are kept low, so that changes in status are rapidly identified and patients who require more intensive treatments or procedures are attended to by an appropriate number of nurses, mid-level practitioners, and physicians. During a disaster, act of terrorism, or public health emergency, there may be a larger number of patients who require critical care admission than there are available beds. Medical leadership along with hospital administration and the hospital ethics committee should develop a rapid discharge tool for attending physicians to use in situations where it is prudent to move certain patients to subacute care floors, or discharge them to other facilities in order to create more critical care surge capacity within the facility. A second aspect of critical care surge management is the adjustment of the staff-to-patient ratio. If critical care units possess beds that are unfilled because of staffing levels, these beds should be used or, as space permits, beds could be added and the ratio of nurses and house staff to patients increased. This would require more staff; however, it may allow for a temporary ability to handle more admissions to critical care units during or following disasters.",

            "text": "As with the discussion above of ventilator allocation, hospitals may not have an endless supply of pharmaceuticals or medical countermeasures to an agent of concern during a calamity, especially in an austere setting. Many hospitals write preparedness plans which specify that they would contact other hospitals to obtain necessary medications, or use caches of medical equipment and supplies such as the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), or even enter into preferred vendor agreements where vendors would maintain an inventory of supplies that are earmarked for a specific hospital. This strategy is helpful for a local or geographically limited event; however, in a regionwide event where all health care facilities need the same types of supplies, a shortage is likely to develop, and hospitals may not be able to keep sufficient stock of medical countermeasures specific to the illness or agent of concern. In this case, if alternative countermeasures are not appropriate or clinically effective, it may be necessary for the physician leadership, pharmacist-in-charge, and the ethics committee to develop an appropriate formulary tool that goes beyond the indications for use promulgated by the health department or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This is one reason that The Joint Commission has required facilities to adopt the 96-hour rule of self-sufficiency before relying upon external resources during a disaster.1\n",

Access to imaging, additional ventilators, operating suites, and ancillary services can contribute positively to a hospital\u2019s ability to handle a surge during or following a disaster. Trigger points on when to make these decisions are ones that should be discussed by hospital administration, emergency planners, and medical leadership in advance of a disaster, and clear guidance on when and how this will be done should be present in emergency plans and understood by decision makers.

Furthermore, the very definition of standards of care permits extenuating circumstances and hence requires no further changes.6 An extrapolation of this argument in legal parlance predicts that any alteration would be detrimental to patient care and that physicians should be awarded no special considerations or immunity even during catastrophic circumstances7 Altered standards of care can be defined as a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster.8\n",

To paraphrase a famous quote, it is the \u201cthe greatest good for the greatest number.\u201d13 An ideal triage system would be easy to understand, identify and deliver resources in a timely manner, be adaptive and evolve with the rapid change in surroundings, optimize resource allocation, neither underestimate the injuries of a critical patient (undertriage), nor divert unnecessary resources by overstating the patient\u2019s condition (overtriage).

These criteria would include general considerations, global sorting, lifesaving interventions, and assignment of triage categories.17 In an effort to standardize and universalize mass casualty triage, an expert committee performed a detailed analysis and review of existing triage systems and proposed the SALT (sort, assess, lifesaving intervention, transport) system.18 This is one of the most exhaustive and detailed analyses of all existing triage systems in place. After much deliberation, the committee proposed the Model Uniform Core Criteria (MUCC) protocol for mass casualty triage. MUCC include 24 specific criteria that are detailed yet easy to implement, allow greater interoperator consistency, and permit further modifications. Most triage systems, including SALT, currently use 15 of these criteria. Though MUCC was well received in the disaster preparedness community, its formal acceptance and implementation nationwide remains a challenge. As of 2010, only 18 states in the United States had implemented statewide MUCC-compliant mass casualty triage protocols.19 SALT was conceived so as to make triage easy to understand across jurisdictions, avoid confusion, and improve outcomes. Although it appears effective in principle, further research needs to be undertaken to establish the efficacy of such a system in large-scale disasters. The National Disaster Life Support Foundation (NDLSF) offers training in SALT along with other methodologies for disaster preparedness.",

Dr. Anna Pou, a practicing surgeon, and her nursing team were assisting in the evacuation of critical patients from Memorial Medical Center. With no imminent help, resources, or guidance, her team decided to reverse-triage evacuees. Those who were unlikely to survive the process were given palliative care with sedation and analgesia. Although there were no specific guidelines to do so, Dr. Pou exercised her clinical judgment in these cases. Volunteer physicians are routinely asked to make such tough choices and expected to formulate, design, and implement such criteria or algorithms, placing an extra burden on them and their ability to care for patients.21 In one of its most controversial decisions yet, the Louisiana Attorney General\u2019s office decided to pursue criminal charges against Dr. Pou and her team for administering palliative doses of sedatives and analgesics to expectant patients. Dr. Pou was a salaried employee, as were her nurses, and thus not considered a volunteer worker, which disqualified her from the legal shield of the Uniform Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioners Act (UEVHPA). (We discuss UEVHPA and other regulations in more detail below.) As stated previously, no laws exist to shield care providers from willful or negligible acts of malpractice. The case against Dr. Pou was subsequently dropped, although civil cases lingered until they were dismissed later. In response, Dr. Pou championed the cause of better protection for health care volunteers and physicians in the State of Louisiana,22 including salaried and paid workers participating in disaster care. Though such laws were later implemented and have brought better clarity and improved protection in Louisiana, the rest of the nation still lags behind.",

Such a committee can routinely assess the effectiveness of current triage protocols, design and implement routine exercises for all responders and volunteers, liaise with local and state emergency planning committees, and maintain a vigilant review of MCI triage success and failures.

Furthermore, only health care volunteers registered with EMAC are afforded protection under the Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA), which provides legal immunity for such workers. These limitations were tragically obvious during the Gulf Coast hurricanes of the late 90s and early 2000s. FTCA was preceded by the Federal Volunteer Protection Act (FVPA) of 1997, which provided legal immunity to volunteer workers from nonprofit organizations, provided they did not receive any remuneration over $500 per year.42 A consideration in using out-of-state workers under EMAC agreements is the need to secure malpractice coverage and verify credentialing to minimize risk and liability exposure.",

This act was envisioned with idea of providing a legal platform for interstate cooperation between government and private sectors by allowing qualified volunteers to provide much-needed assistance to disaster-stricken regions. UEVHPA maintains a database of preregistered volunteers who can be effectively deployed to provide care without excessive delays for state credentialing, background checks, etc. It also allows expedited registration during an emergency for volunteers who are not already in the system. Most states receiving these volunteers (host states) reserve the right to determine the role and capacity of these volunteers and usually do not permit any activity outside their scope of practice. In 2007 NCCUSL approved further amendments to the UEVHPA regarding civil liability protection for volunteer workers, providing more specific language regarding the application of this law.43 As is the case with all these laws, acts of willful, wanton misconduct or criminal activity are exempt from these scenarios.",

One school of thought proposes that there is no evidence that shows that lack of, or unclear, immunity for physicians hampers volunteer participation in disasters, although some studies find otherwise.44 An extrapolation of this point of view is that altruistic physicians are rarely deterred in such cases, and shielding volunteer physicians creates a division of those who can be held accountable versus those who cannot. Not all physicians who deliver care during crises are volunteers. Non-volunteer physicians are compensated and remunerated for their services and are held liable for malpractice. Non-volunteers tend to treat patients who are financially sounder, whereas volunteers are likely to treat the indigent and destitute. Giving volunteers immunity would take away any legal recourse for the most indigent and destitute should they receive substandard care. Protecting volunteer physicians has been called \u201cunwise, unnecessary and unjust.\u201d8\n",

A detailed plan to effectively deploy the countermeasures must be established. The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 serves as an important reminder. While the public health measures undertaken to decrease the spread of disease are suspected to have been largely successful, the deployment of oseltamivir\u2014an antiviral to treat influenza\u2014met with unexpected challenges. Because of cost-saving and shelf life concerns, the Mexican government invested in a dried oral powder requiring reconstitution, with a plan to ship locally for reconstitution. When the pandemic was identified, officials sent the medication, only to learn that local laboratories did not have the necessary components to reconstitute the medication and the medication would have to be shipped back and reconstituted centrally. This with other factors led to a delay of 11 days before the first doses of oseltamivir could be administered.79\n",

Loss of water and electricity is the most common problem concerning food services, according to a survey of food service directors, yet the majority of the directors polled were unable to identify alternative water sources or procedures to sanitize the lines if they become contaminated.80 Hospitals should consider a stockpile of food and water for a minimum of 96 hours, planning for one quart of water per person per day, taking surge capacity into account. In the setting of advance notice of a potential event, consider expanding reserves to a 5- to 7-day supply. Whenever possible, a normal meal schedule should be maintained, though it may be necessary to adapt menus to supplies. Donations may be accepted if necessary. Drinking water should be preserved, and toilets should be flushed only with nonpotable water. Hospital food supplies should be reserved for patients, and physicians or families should plan to bring their own food supplies. Food stockpiles may be rotated for items with limited shelf life to minimize waste. Interfacility transfer agreements should consider transfer of food and water with the patient. Agreements between suppliers can be made in advance to supply hospitals with additional food in these settings. Food and nutritional services employees are critical employees in a disaster, and planning should directly involve the director of food services.72\n",

ACSs can serve as areas for primary screening and triage or short-term medical treatment, assist in diverting nonacute patients from hospital EDs, and manage non\u2013life-threatening illnesses in a systematic and efficient manner. In addition to diverting patients to an alternative location where limited medical care can be provided, such as influenza-type care (hydration, bronchodilator therapy, antibiotics and antivirals, etc.) patients could be discharged from acute hospitals to this location prior to returning home. This would allow the health system to handle a surge beyond its original capacity, and in a far-reaching public health emergency allow for the recovery of the health system. Maintaining consistent standards of care in these settings is essential to a uniform approach to the medical management of a public health emergency.",

This strategy may relieve hospitals of new admissions and allow them to focus on patients in need of either emergency care or more sophisticated (critical) care than could be provided in an ACS. In order to use the limited resources at the ACS to treat the most appropriate patients, it is necessary to adopt a model where patients from the community can receive a medical evaluation at another location, where a determination can be made as to the patient\u2019s clinical acuity and where the patient can be most appropriately treated (i.e., home, hospital, or ACS/community-based care center). Public health agencies across the country are working on this model, and states such as New York have adopted statewide models for ACSs to augment the traditional health system during a public health emergency.",
