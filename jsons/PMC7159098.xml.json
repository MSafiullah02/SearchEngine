To the extent that IB scholars have examined the phenomenon of terrorism in the past, most have viewed it through the prism of political risk, treating it as a country\u2010level threat, akin to other types of sociopolitical violence endemic to developing countries, such as civil war, riots, and labor unrest (Alon, Gurumoorthy, Mitchell, & Steen, 2006; Phatak, Bhagat, & Kashlak, 2004; Simon, 1984). As such, IB researchers have proposed conventional risk management approaches to terrorism focused on avoidance, hedging, and insurance (Howell, 2001). These approaches made sense when the terrorist threat to multinational enterprises (MNEs) emanated primarily from provincial urban guerrilla organizations and their rural, peasant\u2010based counterparts, which bombed oil pipelines, destroyed property, and kidnapped and assassinated business executives and bankers as part of their national liberation campaigns and struggles against Western imperialism (Goldberg, 1990). But this type of left\u2010wing terrorism has long been in retreat.",

            "text": "Today's terrorist threat emanates from a more complex constellation of subnational groups driven by both political and economic prerogatives (Rollins & Wyler, 2010). The list includes criminal cartels that target executives throughout Latin America, tribal gangs that attack multinational personnel and facilities in Nigeria's oil\u2010rich Niger Delta, secessionist kidnap\u2010and\u2010ransom groups in the Philippines, criminal \u201cmafias\u201d throughout Russia and the former Soviet republics, and modern\u2010day pirates that prey on maritime traffic off the coast of Somalia and in the Straits of Malacca (Ackerman, 2008; Alexander & Richardson, 2009). But perhaps the single biggest terrorism\u2010related worry for multinational managers these days emanates from \u201cdark networks\u201d (Milward & Raab, 2009) of religiously inspired militants, which target foreign political and business interests as part of their jihad against the West.1 These clandestine global networks differ from the terrorist groups of the 1970s and 1980s in their motivations, strategy, tactics, and form (Enders & Sandler, 2006; Hoffman, 2006; Wernick, 2006). Moreover, as this case study demonstrates, these groups are increasingly broadening their targets to include places where international business executives, tourists, and ordinary citizens convene, such as luxury hotels. Adapting to this dynamic threat environment requires new strategies and approaches on the part of MNEs, and IB scholars and practitioners can learn much from companies like Marriott International that are on the frontlines of the battle, and at the forefront of innovation.",

Throughout the siege the assailants received tactical guidance via mobile phone from their controllers in Pakistan, enabling them to navigate the properties with deadly precision. The net result was devastating: three dozen killed at the Taj, scores more wounded, and untold millions of dollars in damage to the colonial\u2010era property. The destruction wrought at the Oberoi was of commensurate magnitude.

Both incidents involved amphibious landings, hostage takings, and the use of firearms and grenades. The response of Israel's commandos to the earlier siege, however, was quite different.

The reasons are myriad: First, hotels are symbolic targets of Western affluence and influence that attract precisely the kind of people the militants seek to eliminate\u2014foreign diplomats, businesspeople, tourists, and local elites. Second, luxury hotels, like restaurants, night clubs, shopping malls, and public transportation systems, are \u201csoft targets,\u201d presenting few obstacles to determined terrorists. Indeed, hotels are open environments with multiple points of entrance and egress and a constant flow of traffic, including hotel guests and visitors, staff, merchants, and delivery people. Hotels also lend themselves to preattack reconnaissance, with floor plans, photos, and panoramic video clips of public areas often available over the Internet. Government and military facilities, by contrast, are much more heavily guarded. Even commercial aircraft, the preferred soft target of the 1970s and 1980s, are much better protected since 9/11\u2014though not inviolable, as the Christmas day 2009 attempt against a Detroit\u2010bound Northwest Airlines passenger jet demonstrates.",

Following the US\u2010led coalition intervention in Afghanistan after 9/11, al Qaeda evolved from a highly centralized organization to a much flatter entity.7 Today, the global jihadist movement founded by Osama bin Laden comprises the remnants of the Saudi exile's al Qaeda organization ensconced along Pakistan's rugged northwest frontier; loosely affiliated regional franchises such as LeT in Pakistan, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) in Indonesia, and the Abu Sayaaf Group in the Philippines; \u201chomegrown\u201d militants such as those that carried out the July 2005 (7/7) London transportation system bombings; and legions of sympathizers around the globe connected via the Web or in spirit. These affiliated groups typically lack the resources and training to mount a successful attack on a Western embassy or airline, and so have turned their attention to easier targets\u2014hotels (Gunaratna, 2009).",

Among the earliest such attacks was the 1946 bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem by the Zionist paramilitary organization the Irgun. The blast, aimed at British government and military offices located on the premises rather than hotel guests or staff, killed 91 and injured 46 (Hoffman, 2006). The PLO, as previously mentioned, attacked the Savoy in Tel Aviv in 1975, although the group had a decided preference for hijacking passenger aircraft (Ensalaco, 2008). The Irish Republican Army (IRA) regularly targeted hotels and other commercial enterprises during its campaign of violence against the UK government (Jackson, Dixon, & Greenfield, 2007).8 And attacks on Spanish hotels and resorts have been a staple of Euskadi Ta Askatasuna's (ETA) repertoire during its 50\u2010year struggle for an independent Basque homeland (Lutz & Lutz, 2006). But the new wave of post\u20109/11 attacks on hotels is different in important respects from those of the past.

The Mumbai case is illustrative. The terrorists used digital technology to conduct preoperational surveillance of the properties, made their way across the Arabian Sea from Karachi to Mumbai aided by global positioning systems, communicated by satellite phone with their handlers during the journey, and quickly located their targets once on land, having studied satellite images from Google Earth. Once the shooting began, the attackers were in constant communication with their foreign handlers using cell phones linked to a voice\u2010over Internet protocol (VoIP) account\u2014a system designed to thwart the efforts of Indian security forces to trace and intercept the calls (LaRaia & Walker, 2009). According to Mumbai police, the gunmen made or received some 284 calls over the course of the siege, running nearly 1,000 minutes (Unnikrishnan, Ahmed Ali, & Kartikeya, 2009). Those calls, routed through a New Jersey\u2013based VoIP provider, enabled the handlers, watching the events unfold live on television, to alert the shooters to the movements of security forces, thereby prolonging the carnage. The handlers also used these conversations to exhort the gunmen to carry out the attacks until the bitter end (Rabasa et al., 2009).",

To assist the team, Orlob developed an in\u2010house intelligence capacity led by analysts in Washington, DC, and Hong Kong. These analysts would monitor global developments on a 24/7 basis and provide timely risk assessments. But perhaps most importantly, Orlob devised a three\u2010tiered, color\u2010coded system to alert hotel managers in the Marriott chain of the varying threat levels at specific locations around the world and provide security\u2010related procedures to follow (Orlob, 2004).",

Threat Condition Yellow, which could be triggered by a rise in terrorism or political upheaval in the area, requires hotels to check guests entering properties, restrict parking within close proximity to buildings, and halt luggage storage. Finally, under Threat Condition Red, which could result from intelligence indicating a specific threat against a property, hotels must inspect vehicles for explosives at checkpoints, examine luggage, and direct visitors through metal detectors at limited entry points. Adherence to these procedures is ensured by twice\u2010yearly unscheduled visits from third\u2010party auditors, and general managers found to be in noncompliance are subject to harsh disciplinary action.",

For instance, one of the best ways to harden a target, says Orlob, is to limit public disclosure of nonessential information about a property such as building diagrams. Dispatching both plainclothes security officers and uniformed \u201cgreeters\u201d to lobby areas to discreetly look for individuals casing buildings or taking suspicious photographs of entrances or security cameras is another.16 Since terrorists often seek employment at hotels as cover for conducting surveillance, a further way to harden targets is to conduct rigorous background checks of job candidates to weed out those with criminal records and questionable past associations, although, as Orlob points out, it is often impossible to determine whether a candidate covertly subscribes to a violent political ideology.17\n",

To prevent this type of catastrophe from occurring at one of its hotels, Marriott requires general managers to provide authorities with detailed photos and floor plans along with contact information for key executives.19 He also believes that hotel staff and government security forces should conduct periodic \u201cfamiliarization drills\u201d so they understand the hotel's layout in the event of an emergency.",

After all, surveys indicate that guests rank security at the top of their list of priorities when choosing destinations, and are willing to pay a premium for it (Slevitch & Amit, 2008). And while few hotels currently call attention to the security features of their hotels let alone market them, this may change in the future\u2014especially if attacks continue to increase in scope and intensity.

As such, some observers believe that luxury hotels\u2014particularly those located in high threat locations\u2014need to adopt a new mindset. Gunaratna, for example, believes that international hotels need to begin operating on the principle that terrorist attacks against their facilities are \u201cinevitable\u201d and take action to build resiliency. This involves embedding security into everything from architectural designs to hiring practices, while developing intelligent systems to thwart hostile surveillance, and crafting more effective emergency response plans that involve close collaboration between the government and private sector. Adopting such an approach, however, he cautions, will be neither easy nor cheap and is likely to be resisted by general managers who believe that luxury properties should focus exclusively on maximizing guest comfort and convenience and pursuing profits.

Writing in the Journal of International Business Studies in 1984, Jeffrey D. Simon offered a framework for conceptualizing political risk that remains influential (e.g., Alon et al., 2006; Czinkota et al., 2010). He argued that terrorist attacks represented a direct\u2010internal risk that emanated from the host society\u2014in the same league as protests, strikes, riots, and demonstrations. By contrast, expropriations, restrictions on remittances, wage and price controls, and the like represented direct\u2010internal political risks, stemming from the host government. While Simon did not analyze corporate response to political risk in great detail, the implications for MNEs seeking to minimize their exposure to terrorism and sociopolitical violence were fairly straightforward: carefully scan the environment for signs of strife and avoid countries prone to instability and unrest (Kobrin, 1982), delay investments to the extent possible (Rivoli & Salorio 1996), limit their size and scope (Delios & Henisz, 2000), and purchase political risk insurance (Wells, 1998).",

His framework for integrated risk management identified both financial and strategic approaches for managing environmental uncertainty. The former included activities that could be pursued without altering corporate strategy, such as purchasing insurance and futures contracts, whereas the latter comprised five strategies: avoidance, control, cooperation, imitation, and flexibility. MNEs have traditionally dealt with the terrorist menace by employing the first two of Miller's five strategies: avoidance and control. Avoidance has typically been achieved by forgoing business opportunities in countries prone to terrorism or locating operations in remote areas of the country, whereas control has been accomplished through investments in security training for executives and perimeter fortifications for facilities (Ackerman, 2008). Taken together, these moves represent what Kapstein (2006) has described as an \u201cenclave strategy.\u201d",

BCP may involve everything from mirroring data to establishing emergency building evacuation procedures. Such plans must be regularly audited, tested, and refined, so that they can be executed with precision when needed. The critical importance of the BCP process was laid bare on 9/11 in the contrasting fortunes of two financial services companies headquartered in the World Trade Center (WTC): Morgan Stanley and Cantor Fitzgerald. The former escaped the tragedy relatively unscathed, with all but 13 of its 2,700 employees surviving the attacks (Ripley, 2008), whereas the latter lost more than two thirds of its 960 employees, including its entire board of directors, president, vice chairman, chief operating officer, and chief financial officer (Parrett, 2007).
