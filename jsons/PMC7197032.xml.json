According to the definition of cultural heritage provided by the UNESCO, the term includes several main categories of heritage: cultural heritage sensu stricto including tangible cultural heritage (movable cultural heritage, immovable cultural heritage and underwater cultural heritage), intangible cultural heritage (oral traditions, performing arts, rituals), natural heritage and heritage in the event of an armed conflicted. UNESCO defines culture as the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society or a social group, that encompasses, not only art and literature, but lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs [27, p. 9]. Therefore, the culture as understood by UNESCO is included into the definition of cultural heritage (as both tangible and intangible cultural heritage).",

The European perspective sets a firm example for the parts of the world where Internet is widely accessible and used. Of course, such trend had been visible (especially in the well Internet-connected regions) already before the pandemic started, but just after introducing the new governmental security measures it developed rapidly and took interesting directions. Currently, all most famous cultural institutions are active online, and a significant of the smaller ones also follows the path. The still vivid question is how the online culture participation will look like after the end of the pandemic.",
