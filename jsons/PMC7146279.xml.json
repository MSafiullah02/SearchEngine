            "text": "Hypertension, a long-term medical condition known as high blood pressure, is a major risk factor for vision loss, stroke, heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and more than a quarter of the world\u2019s adult population in 2000 had hypertension [1]. Therapeutic approaches have focused on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which regulates blood pressure and electrolyte balance in humans [2]. In the RAAS, renin stimulates the generation of angiotensin I (AngI), which is converted to vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (AngII) by angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). Two isoforms (somatic and testicular) of ACE are transcribed by ACE gene in a tissue-specific manner. The somatic form (sACE) is a zinc dependent dicarboxypeptidase, which includes two homologous domains (N domain and C domain) with ~60% sequence identity and the same zinc motif HEXXH (X = any amino acid residue) [3,4]. For the past decades, it has been reported that the C domain of human sACE has the main AngI converting site in controlling blood pressure and cardiovascular functions [5]. ACE hydrolyzes decapeptide (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu) AngI by cleaving a dipeptide from the C-terminus to produce octapeptide (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) AngII, which causes blood vessels to narrow and stimulates the secretion of the hormone aldosterone, resulting in increased blood pressure [6,7]. ACE also affects blood pressure by inactivating the vasodilators bradykinin and kallidin [8]. Therefore, ACE has long been a major target for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular ailments by the use of ACE inhibitors [9].",

A crystal structure, which is a time and ensemble averaged snapshot, do not complete our understanding. Proteins are not rigid. They are flexible and dynamic in solution, fluctuating among many conformational sub-states [23]. In addition to its structure, knowledge of the dynamics of an enzyme and understanding the mechanisms of activation and inhibition is crucial for the design of better drugs [24]. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are known as a powerful tool for molecular modeling and investigating dynamics of proteins and have been applied to various systems successfully [25]. Recently, MD simulations of ACE with various ligands were reported for drug discovery and molecular modeling for interactions between the enzyme and potential inhibitors [14,15,16,18,26].",

The simulations focus on the C domain in which the AngI is mainly converted [5]. In the ligand-free simulation (Apo), we observed the mouth opening and closing motions of sACE like the Pac-Man of an arcade game in 1980\u2019s [27]. This large hinge bending motion implies the existence of pre-existing backbone conformations. Figure 1 shows the overall structure of the enzyme. The secondary structure of the sACE is predominantly alpha helical (Figure 1). The structure has an elliptical shape with dimensions approximately 73 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 52 \u00c53, and the cleft around the active site expands about 31 \u00c5 (PDB ID: 4APH). The cleft divides the sACE into two subdomains, and the active site is located on the both of their inner surfaces. Two subdomains of sACE were defined as subdomain I including the N-terminus and the zinc ion (residues Asp40-Leu122, Pro297-Gly437, Asp551-Gly583) and subdomain II including the C-terminus (residues Glu123-Ala296, Gly438-Cys550, Gln584-Ser625). Two kinds of inhibitors, BPPb (bradykinin potentiating peptide b, Glu-Gly-Leu-Pro-Pro-Arg-Pro-Lys-Ile-Pro-Pro) [17] and SPI (Spirulina derived heptapeptide, Thr-Met-Glu-Pro-Gly-Lys-Pro) [18] as competitive and mixed non-competitive, respectively, were used to investigate the difference in the inhibition mechanisms. Mixed type non-competitive inhibition mode of SPI was determined by Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot, and a model of inhibition mechanism was studied by the previous study [18].",

Like all others, the structure of the complex was also in the closed state defined by the distance between two lips (Figure 1) shorter than 15 \u00c5 (13.64 \u00c5). As simulation time went by the enzyme spontaneously opened its mouth, and the mouth gradually reclosed from the open state before returning back to the semi-open and open states. We defined the open state with a distance longer than 20 \u00c5 and the semi-open state with distances longer than 15 \u00c5 and shorter than 20 \u00c5. We observed multiple conversion between the open and closed states during 400 ns simulation (Figure 2). We believe that this is the first work that shows the spontaneous opening and closing motions of ACE by MD simulation (Video S1). In 2019, Yu et al. ran an MD simulation with ligand-free ACE only for 10 ns, but they did not report the opening and closing motions [14].",

Two models of enzyme mechanisms, induce-fit [33] and pre-existing equilibrium dynamics [34] represent the conformational changes and dynamics upon ligand binding.

Introducing mutations, ligands or chimera are common methods to enhance thermal stability and to crystalize a protein. In addition, the absence of the open conformation in a ligand-free ACE imply the intrinsic flexibility of ACE. Again, only one available structure in the open conformation is resolved with ACE2 [32]. In addition, a previous study using normal mode analysis (NMA) with testicular ACE (tACE, another isoform of ACE) and ACE2 showed the intrinsic flexibility and open and closed conformational models of ACE [35].

This equilibrium, however, is changed in the presence of AngI, and the closed state becomes more stable than the open state due to the binding of the substrate. Then the C-terminal dipeptide (His-Leu) of AngI is hydrolyzed. AngII, the product of the enzyme activity, might be released when sACE is in the semi-open state (Figure 2 and Figure S7).

Qualitatively, the equilibrium shift is the same way as the case of substrate binding. After release of the inhibitor, the equilibrium goes back to the first stage of the Apo form. Since AngII occupies the same active site, until the release of AngII sACE cannot take any substrate. This is true for the substrate too. Interestingly, SPI the mixed non-competitive inhibitor makes use of this. The interactions of SPI not only with sACE but also with AngII stabilized sACE in the closed state further, resulting in a dead-end complex by holding the product of enzyme AngII in the active site [18]. Since SPI does not share the binding site with the substrate, it becomes non-competitive. Even though SPI is non-competitive, it binds next to the active site and interacts with the substrate, becoming a mixed type inhibitor [18]. The binding sites of various drugs and drug candidates were studied intensively, and along the various ligands, binding sites and their conformations are various too. This indicates the binding of a specific ligand induce a specific conformation of its binding site. Therefore, the overall large backbone open and closed conformational state pre-exist, and the sidechain and minor backbone rearrangement may be induced upon ligand binding.",

The preferred states as well as the extent of flexibility were strongly dependent on the presence of a ligand. The transformation from the semi-open to the closed state in the bound forms was directly influenced by the interaction between the residues of binding sites of the substrate and the inhibitors. These interactions constrained the enzyme structure to remain in the semi-open and closed states. However, it would seem that the putative binding pathway is too narrow to accommodate the substrate and inhibitors. Therefore, the semi-open conformation might be the state where the ligands can bind. Our MD simulation results and the mechanistic model of sACE activation and inhibition portends not only drug design for hypotension treatment but also wide applications in molecular biophysics and beyond.",

The average pressure and the temperature were maintained at 1 bar and 310 K, respectively. All heavy atoms during the energy minimization, heating and the first 200 ps of NPT simulation were restrained with harmonic potential with a force constant 1 kcal/mol\u00b7A2. After that, the harmonic position restraints were removed, allowing all atoms in the systems to relax. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained, allowing an integration time step of 2 fs. The non-bonded interactions were smoothly truncated from 10 \u00c5 to 12 \u00c5 cutoff, and the particle-mesh Ewald method was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions [41].
