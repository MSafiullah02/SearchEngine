            "text": "Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are defined by clinical criteria, outlined in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines [1]. These include an acute increase in one or more of the following cardinal symptoms, beyond day to day variability: dyspnea, increased frequency or severity of cough and increased volume or change in character of sputum, which represent an acute increase in airway inflammation. The role of infection in the pathogenesis of COPD, acute exacerbation and disease progression has been a clinical and research question for many years, and the pendulum has swung from infection as a major cause of acute exacerbation and COPD (British Hypothesis) [2], to infection as an unrelated epiphomenon in acute exacerbation [3\u20135], and back again to infection as integral in the development of AECOPD and likely an important contributor to COPD progression [6\u201319]. Upwards of 80 % of AECOPD are driven by infectious stimuli, with 40\u201350 % associated with bacterial infection and 30\u201350 % associated with acute viral infection, with some exacerbations having dual bacterial and viral causation [20]. Much of the advancement in our understanding of the role of infection is AECOPD is due to the advancement of clinical and research tools that have allowed researchers to accurately characterize the microbial pathogens, and better understand the host-pathogen interactions (Table 1).\n",

The airways of patients with COPD have significant infiltration of inflammatory cells (polymorphonuclear cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes) and much higher numbers of alveolar macrophages than are seen in healthy persons [21\u201327]. The nature of the inflammatory infiltrate suggests and supports the findings of both viral and bacterial infections, with recruitment of immune cells pertinent to both the innate and adaptive immune response. Despite the recruitment of appropriate effector immune cells, in many patients with advanced stage COPD (GOLD III-IV), there is persistent presence of pathogens in the airway, rather than eradication [19, 28], suggesting an impaired host response to infection. Numerous studies have delineated impaired macrophage phagocytosis and cytokine secretion [29\u201331], impaired humoral immune response to infection [32\u201337] and impaired T-lymphocyte responses [38]. The mechanisms of this impaired responsiveness of both innate and adaptive immune cells to infection has not been clearly delineated, and remains a target of investigation.",

            "text": "Although the temporal association of bacterial presence in the airway and COPD exacerbation was first recognized in the early 1950s, there was divergence away from bacterial causation of AECOPD during the 1970s and 1980s related to several observations. There were no differences observed in sputum bacterial isolation rates (at a species level) in between stable state and exacerbations, and studies of immune response studies to bacterial pathogens and placebo controlled antibiotic trials showed inconsistent and contradictory results [4, 39]. Beginning in 1992, multiple investigators began to recognize an effect of bacterial infection and colonization in stable COPD [11, 17, 32, 40\u201345], but a direct association with AECOPD was not initially recognized. The bacterial isolation in these early studies was done predominantly by sputum culture, and as such, most pathogens isolated can be nasopharyngeal commensals in healthy adults, raising the issue of specimen contamination. In addition, the older studies could not differentiate among strains of a pathogenic species, assuming that all strains isolated from sputum over time were identical. Advancing diagnostic techniques of bronchoscopy with protected specimen brushes and bronchoalveolar lavage, as well as molecular bacterial typing allowed identification of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and others at potentially pathogenic concentrations) in the distal airways in stable COPD [9, 17, 28, 40, 41, 46\u201351], with more severe GOLD stage disease being associated with identification of Pseudomonas. Subsequent studies went on to associate colonization with more severe spirometric airflow obstruction [43]. Expanding on the recognition of bacterial colonization during stable COPD, it was recognized that the prevalence of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract increased significantly during AECOPD as compared to stable COPD, when sampled by bronchoscopy [10, 46\u201348, 52]. Scientific advancement led to the recognition that changes in the overall numbers of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the airways between periods of colonization and acute exacerbation mattered less than the acquisition of a new strain of bacteria [10, 15\u201317, 28, 47]. Acquisition of a new strain of bacteria (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa) was associated with a greater likelihood of symptoms of an exacerbation, increased inflammatory markers both locally and systemically (TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IL-6, CRP, Neutrophil elastase) and development of a specific host immune response to the infecting pathogen [8, 10, 11, 15, 28, 47]. Although some authors have described a link between the presence of Chlamydia penumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella infection and AECOPD [53\u201355], these studies measured single serologic titers rather than serologic conversion, and an additional respiratory pathogen was often identified. Studies using serologic conversion as a diagnostic criterion or molecular detection to identify the presence of atypical bacterial DNA in sputa [56] during AECOPD indicate only a minor role of these bacteria in exacerbations, often with co-infection with typical bacterial pathogens (Table 1).\n",

Two groups recently published data using PhyloChip microarray analysis and quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of the variable regions of the 16S rDNA. The first study identified the bacterial diversity seen during severe AECOPD requiring intubation in eight patients [57], noting significant bacterial richness (as defined by the number of bacterial taxa detected) that waned with prolonged intubation. The common \u2018core\u2019 of 75 bacterial taxa representing 27 classified bacterial families was identified in all patients studied. This group included members of the Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacteraceae and Helicobacteraceae families, among others. The majority of the bacteria belonged to the Proteobacteria phylum, with smaller contributions from Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The second study addressed the effects of cigarette smoke on the bacterial diversity in comparing healthy smokers to smokers with COPD to non-smokers [58]. The investigators demonstrated lung resident bacteria in all groups, and the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, as noted in the first study. There was heterogeneity in the bacterial communities in the non-smoker, healthy smoker and mild COPD patients, which was lost in the patients with moderate and severe COPD. Within each patient, geographic differences in bacterial heterogeneity were also noted, suggesting micro-anatomic differences in bacterial communities within the lung. Whether the micro-anatomic, spatially distinct bacterial communities within the lung or the overall airway bacterial diversity represent mechanisms of disease progression or contribute to AECOPD remains to be determined.",

The diagnosis of viral infection was initially done by cell culture and serologic methods, with more recent studies detecting viral infection by PCR in either sputa, BAL or nasopharyngeal swabs, with the greatest recovery seen in sputa as compared to nasopharyngeal swabs [59, 60]. The most commonly recovered viruses (varying in prevalence in various studies) in AECOPD using the more sensitive PCR detection methods were influenza, rhinovirus, respiratory synctial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, with the majority of infections due to rhinovirus. These viruses were also found in stable COPD, and it is not clear if those findings were subclinical infection or colonization, as there were no symptoms of active infection in the preceding 30 days [13, 14, 59\u201362]. Therefore, the presence of viruses in respiratory samples detected by sensitive techniques such as PCR may not always correlate with an acute infection and should be interpreted in its clinical context.",

Alveolar macrophages are also less able to phagocytose bacteria in patients with COPD [29, 30, 68] and have a less robust response to bacterial proteins, specifically OMP6 and LOS of NTHI [29], and are less able to clear apoptotic cells from the airway [69]. Both disease and cigarette smoke exposure contribute to this relative hypo-responsiveness, as alveolar macrophages from smokers who had ceased smoking have better phagocytic ability than those who continue to smoke [30, 31], and both were reduced relative to healthy controls. The ongoing presence of apoptotic cells in the airway may function as a source of endogenous ligand for inappropriate self-directed immune responses.",

Development of chronic bronchitis and airway obstruction in smokers is associated with further deterioration in MCC [71, 73, 74]. Infiltrating neutrophils likely contribute to MCC impairment, probably mediated by increased mucus production (mediated through proteolytic cleavage of TGF\u03b1 and increased EGF receptor (EGFR) binding), reduced ciliary beating and reduced viscoelastic properties of mucus [75].",

The literature has demonstrated conflicting results [76\u201381], and though these trials were quite heterogenous, they supported the issue of the importance of secreted airway immunity. The more recent trials support geographic changes in the structural integrity of the lung, demonstrating localized areas of IgA deficiency associated with altered epithelial cell integrity, and reduced pIgR expression (polymeric IgG receptor), which is required for trancytosis of the structural components of the IgA molecule from the basolateral to the apical surface of the epithelial cell. The reduction in expression of the IgA transport system was supported by findings of reduced total IgA in the BAL of patients with COPD [81, 82]. In contrast, the systemic IgA response elicited in the bronchial mucosa seems preserved in COPD, as demonstrated in COPD patients with Chlamydia pneumoniae infection [78].",

            "text": "An increasing number of polypeptides with antimicrobial activity have been identified in the airway surface fluid that may play an important role in host defense in the respiratory tract [83\u201385]. One major group of these peptides is cationic polypeptides. These include lysozyme, which is lytic to many bacterial membranes; lactoferrin, which excludes iron from bacterial metabolism; defensins, which are released from leukocytes and respiratory epithelial cells; and the cathelicidin family of proteins, (of which only LL-37 is found in humans), which are present in specific granules of neutrophils and airway epithelial cells [86\u201396]. Deficiency in salivary lysozyme and sputum secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) has been related to more frequent exacerbations [15, 97\u201399]. In patients with normal baseline SLPI levels, these levels drop significantly at the time of infective exacerbations, which return to normal after resolution of the exacerbation [89]. Lower levels of lysozyme and lactoferrin are noted with both colonization and infective exacerbations with NTHI and Moraxella catarrhalis, as compared to pre-acquisition levels [89]. In contrast, LL-37 levels have been shown to increase in the presence of airway bacteria, both in states of colonization as well as infection, with greater increases during infective exacerbation, as compared to colonization [89]. The divergent responses of the airway anti-microbial peptides during infective exacerbation underscores the fundamental importance of host-pathogen interactions. Lower levels may be related to consumption in the face of infection, or a mechanism of bacterial evasion of immune clearance. The role of tobacco smoke specifically on the anti-microbial peptides has not been well studied, though murine models suggest that at least with regards to SLPI, the presence of tobacco smoke was deleterious to the protease inhibitory activity [100].",

This non-classical activation (or damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) activation), may explain the pro-inflammatory state seen in cigarette smoking healthy controls. Recent data defines a direct effect of cigarette smoke induced MMP and CXCL-8 secretion from epithelial cells that is mediated by activation of TLR4 [111\u2013113], and independent of LPS present in the extract. This was neutralized by the addition of anti-oxidants, suggesting an oxidant stress induced activation of TLR4.",

It is likely that that with disease progression, there is progressive dysregulation of the immune response to invading pathogens, and downward spiral of inflammation, infection, altered immune response, inflammation and and tissue injury, that is amplified during periods of AECOPD.",
