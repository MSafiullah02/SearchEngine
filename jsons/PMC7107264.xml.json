Instead, we encode K-mers as character states and estimate posterior probabilities (PPs) of bipartitions using Mr-bayes (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist and Huelsenback, 2003). For the purpose of this work, we (a) build the consensus tree employing the extended 50% majority rule (Felsenstein, 2005) and (b) use the consensus tree to estimate the accuracy of the method, although more sophisticated ways of utilizing the resulting data are possible.",

            "text": "Each possible K-mer is either present in or absent from a sequence, and thus the K-mer content of each sequence can be encoded by a set of binary states variables. However, because the number of possible K-mers grows exponentially with k, and most K-mers will not be present in any sequence when k is large, we record presence/absence data only for those K-mers that appear in at least one sequence. This practice introduces a data aquisition bias; fortunately, Mr-bayes implements models that correct for just such an aquisition bias: this correction is achieved by setting the lset coding=noabsencesites option. Felsenstein (1992) developed a model for binary states (the binary model in Mr-bayes), originally for restriction site presence/absence data. Lewis (2001) generalized this model to include \u2265 2 states (the standard discrete model in MrBayes). We use the latter one with two (binary) states. It features an instantaneous rate matrix Q with two stationary state frequencies that model the rate of word gain and word loss. Using this model, it is not possible to estimate unequal stationary state frequencies (they are assumed to be equal), but we can allow the state frequencies to vary over sites, and hence set the symmetric Dirichlet hyperprior (prset symdirihyperpr = exponential(1.0)). The discrete approximation of the Dirichlet distribution uses five categories (default in MrBayes). We place a uniform prior on topology, and an unconstrained exponential prior on branch lengths with mean 0.1 (default in MrBayes). We denote this binary encoding of K-mers by B-bin, and we analyze its convergence and the extent of its burn-in phase at the very end of Results and Discussion.",

            "text": "We note that the presence/absence data from K-mers violate assumptions of the simple binary model in two cases: (a) K-mers appear/disappear together as they overlap; hence, their occurrence is not independent of each other. A simple way to achieve independence is to take words that occur at position a+bk where a \u2208 [1,k] and b takes on values \u2265 0 (subject to sequence-length constraints). This process discards much data and thus seems a reasonable approach only for sufficiently long sequences. (b) K-mer loss is coupled to K-mer gain. Generally, as sequence change reduces the count for one word, the count for another word will be increased. The number of distinct K-mers that are gained or lost as a result of a single sequence change increases with k, and thus the departure of the actual data from our assumption of independent gain and loss is expected to become more apparent for longer words. However, k is relatively small in all of our analyses. Comparison of Figure 1 for B-bin with corresponding figures for other word-based methods suggests that both of these violations have only minor influence in this setting, and statistical analysis will reveal that the best performing parameterizations of B-bin (which exhibit rather short words) and other word-based methods are indistinguishable. To analyze the degree to which the data and the model (mis)match, it is possible to generate data (here, distributions of binary states) under the model and then see how they (dis)agree with actual data. This self-consistency check is known as posterior predictive checking (Gelman et al., 2004).",

To each MRC corresponds a highest scoring multiple sequence alignment according to the word-oriented objective function (Beiko et al., 2005a). Each chosen alignment was subjected to a GBLOCKS (Castresana, 2000) analysis to remove ambiguously aligned regions (for settings see Beiko et al. 2005b; supplementary material). The remaining 22,432 trimmed alignments formed the basis for a Bayesian phylogenetic inference using MrBayes, resulting in as many consensus trees determined by the extended 50% majority rule and complete with PPs for all bipartions. Parameters in this Bayesian analysis were uniform priors on topology, branch length \u2208 (0.0, 10.0], and model of sequence change (five models were considered). ASRV was modeled by a four-category discrete approximation to the continuous gamma distribution, uniformly distributed \u2208 [0.1, 50.0], and with automatic estimation of the shape parameter \u03b1.

The use of bifurcating eight-taxon trees in our synthetic data sets implies five possible values for each RF distance (0.0, 0.2, \u2026, 1.0); therefore, all values in these tables end with an even digit. For each word-based method, we show the best performing word length k for alphabet AA and for alphabet CE (method dW accepts only k = 1 when using conventional similarity matrices, and we test it only on AA). We find that the value of parameter k for each combination of method and alphabet is stable across all three data sets. The only exception is B-bin with CE; on the control set, k = 5 performs somewhat better (with mean RF distances of 0.074, 0.150, 0.314, 0.498, 0.678, 0.810, 0.872). However, k = 4 proved superior on the ASRV and short-sequences data sets and is therefore also included in Table 1. Performance was compared by considering the rank sums over all 700 RF distances; lower rank sums equate to lower overall RF distances and hence higher phylogenetic accuracy. The order of methods in the aforementioned tables is based on these rank sums, and we list all pairwise combinations of methods whose differences in rank sums are deemed statistically significant.",

Then, 14 methods with rank sums from 8127.5 to 9192.5 ensue, separated from each other by values < 200. Two variants of method dC rank third last and second last with 10,286.0 and 10,851.0. On the ASRV data set, rank sums range from 4571.5 for dML to 14,411.0 for dW, a difference slightly more than threefold, indicating that phylogenetic accuracy differs less markedly. In particular, dPB-ML and dPB-SIM with AA follow more closely with rank sums of 4958.5 and 5121.5, as do dPB-ML and dPB-SIM with CE (rank sums: 5647.5 and 5647.5). Then, the same 14 methods as in the control data follow (in different order) with rank sums ranging from 7329.5 to 9119.5. This constitutes a difference of 1790.0 (up from 1065.0 for the control data) and is consequently reflected in large differences between some methods. Again, two variants of method dC rank third last and second last (rank sums: 10,511.0 and 11,216.5). Finally, we observe a distribution of rank sums and spacing of differences in the short sequences data set that is similar to what we find in the control data set.",

Thus, the best performing variant of B-bin is on par with established alignment-free methods. It also means that the relative ranking of individual alignment-free methods is largely without consequences. The situation changes slightly for the ASRV data set: a few subgroups can be recognized.

Therefore, if one is willing to accept the overall decrease in phylogenetic accuracy (its accuracy is still significantly higher than that of any remaining alignment-free method), one can take advantage of the considerable speed-up in running time of pattern-based distance calculation (see Speeding Up Pattern-Based Distance Calculation) and hence, tree reconstruction.

That is, we plot the RF distance for B-bin on the y-axis with the x-axis showing values for all tested word lengths k. Each of the six subfigures contains two curves: one resulting from the use of alphabet AA, the other from the use of alphabet CE. Measurements were obtained from reference sets 2, 4, and 6 of two different data sets: Figures 1a, 1c, 1e corresponds to the control data set and Figures 1b, 1d, 1f to the ASRV data set. Comparison of the left and right panels reveals that presence of high ASRV leads to lower RF distances for the optimal word length under each alphabet.

Encoding sequences with alphabet CE improves the reconstruction accuracy of long branches over the use of original sequences. At the same time, alphabet CE negatively affects the reconstruction accuracy of short branches. To see this, consider how the impact on reconstruction accuracy is picked up by the two measures. The FN count treats each branch equally, whereas the DPB count is an extreme form of a weighted variant of FN. One branch receives weight 1 (the deep phylogenetic branch of interest; see Methods), whereas all other branches contribute nothing by setting their weight to 0. Thus, for a given reference set, improvements under measure DPB reflect a better ability to correctly reconstruct branches that separate various phyla and divisions. The data show that under measure FN, alphabet AA is better than CE in three out of four cases, whereas the situation is reversed under measure DPB: alphabet CE yields lower rank sums than AA in three out of four cases. Exceptions to the overall behavior are found for reference sets with few taxa. The lower number of taxa, and hence branches, means that any influence of the alphabet on phylogenetic accuracy for certain data, as reflected in a particular measure, will show up more strongly. On reference set F-S, measure DPB shows lower rank sums for AA and higher rank sums for CE sequences relative to the overall levels. This agrees with the hypothesis that for small branch lengths, alphabet AA is the better choice than CE. On reference set F-L, measure FN yields lower rank sums for alphabet CE than for AA relative to the overall levels. Thus, the improvement in reconstruction accuracy provided by encoding sequences with CE is evident even when we consider all branches, as this reference set is dominated by long branches.",

For these reference sets, consisting of 100 sequence sets each, and hence 100 computations of distances, we show the average running time of a single computation in seconds. Under otherwise identical conditions, reducing the sequence length from 1000 to 300 amino acids reduces computation time for alphabet CE from 101.3 to 8.76 and from 72.5 to 6.48 (sets 1 and 7). Similarly for alphabet AA, computation time is reduced from 25.3 to 5.47 and from 7.80 to 1.09. These numbers also show the effect of alphabet choice on running time: using CE instead of AA increases time by as much as a factor of 9.3. Furthermore, running time and phylogenetic distance are inversely correlated. The short-sequences data exhibit the largest sensitivity to phylogenetic distance: for AA-encoded sequences, reducing phylogenetic distance increases time by a factor of 5.0. In the presence of high ASRV, computation time increases somewhat with respect to the control data to 113.9 and 87.4 for CE and to 26.4 and 11.5 for AA.",

The absolute time (in seconds) for method dPB-ML varies from 864 to 1172 for CE sequences of length 1000 and can be as low as 3.24 for AA sequences of length 300. When we calculate distances using variant dPB-SIM, we find that we obtain speed-ups of 8.3 to 16.8. This is an order of magnitude faster and brings the absolute time down to between 63.4 and 103.6 for CE sequences of length 1000; it can yield computation times as short as 0.39 s for AA sequences of 300 amino acids. It seems quite likely that a further speed-up can be achieved through a reimplementation of dPB-SIM: variant dPB-ML spends most of its computation time in the optimized C implementation of Protdist, whereas dPB-SIM, on the other hand, is written entirely in Python and thus leaves room for an additional performance gain.",

There are two aspects to this problem: determining convergence of chains and determining the extent of the burn-in phase. We note that in practice, it is easier to rule out convergence than to confirm it (Cowles and Carlin, 1996). For solving the second aspect, a variety of techniques have been developed to determine how large N should be, given the data. We follow Beiko et al.

Contrasting these means yields a ratio: if it is close to 1.0 (Beiko et al., 2006), we may assume that we are sampling from a stationary distribution, because in-order and out-of-order values describe a very similar distribution of bipartition probabilities. We divided each chain into eight fragments of 50,000 generations each (starting at generation 100,100). Table 6 shows summary statistics of the \u03b4 ratios for the best performing word length for both alphabets (k = 3, AA; and k = 4, CE). For each data set, the majority of \u03b4 ratios is reasonably close to 1.0; thus the values are likely to indicate convergence.
