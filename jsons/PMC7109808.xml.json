Then the box was solvated with the SPC water model (17). The protein/water system was submitted to energy minimization. Later, counterions were added to the system to provide a neutral simulation system. The whole system was subsequently minimized again.",

All interactive residues between monomer A and B, as shown in Fig. 1C, were monitored for the time occupancy during the whole simulation process. The hydrogen bonds formed on the dimer interface were calculated by using HPLUS (25). Interestingly, more than 10 hydrogen bonding interactions occupy most time of simulation (Table 2), suggesting that the residues involved in these interactions might possibly make well contributions to keep the dimer conformational stability. Guided by this potential information, we selected seven residues on the dimer interface for site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1A). These residues are mainly involved in the dimerization of SARS-CoV 3CLpro through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with their side-chain or main-chain groups (Fig. 2), and single Ala substitution might perturb the entirety of the hydrogen bonding networks on the dimer interface.\n",

According to the published method (29), we first performed the chemical cross-linking analysis of the wild type SARS-CoV 3CLpro. When incubated with 0.05% glutaraldehyde, the protease at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml displayed a form of monomer near 35.0 kDa with the other band corresponding to the dimer (Fig. 5A, lane 6b). With protein concentration increasing, both of the dimeric and monomeric forms increased (Fig. 5A, lanes 5b\u20133b). A similar cross-linking pattern of the protease was observed when using a higher concentration of glutaraldehyde (0.1%), excluding the possibility of obvious artificial cross-linking effects (Fig. 5A, lanes 6a\u20133a). These results indicate that the wild type protease exists as a mixture of monomer and dimer at varying concentrations, which is consistent with the reported studies (7, 8).\n",

The dimeric form of each mutated protease also existed within a wide range of protein concentrations, suggesting that mutation of single residue on the dimer interface could not completely abolish the dimeric structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in solution. However moderate differences of dimer\u2013monomer equilibria do exist among these mutants. For the Ser10_Ala and Glu14_Ala mutants (Fig. 5E and F), the amount of the dimer was relatively low compared with the wild type and other mutated proteases, indicating that the \u03b1-helix A\u2032 of domain I might be an important part of the dimer interface and relatively contribute more to maintain the dimer stability of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. In addition, we should note that the possibility of minor artificial cross-linking effects might still exist due to the appearance of the high-order multimers in SDS\u2013PAGE (Fig. 5). While, considering the chemical cross-linking analyses of the wild type and mutant proteases were performed under exactly same experimental procedures, these analyses might still be convincing to preliminarily examine the effects of these mutations on dimerization of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.",

We used a protein concentration at 5 mg/ml for each run, which represents the highest concentration used in the cross-linking experiments, and the physical states corresponding to native monomeric and dimeric protease were observed. As shown in Fig. 6A, the wild type SARS-CoV 3CLpro elutes in two peaks with the retention volumes at 44.6 and 62.1 ml. The elution profiles of four molecular mass marker proteins confirmed that the first peak might correspond to the dimer state (71.6 kDa) and the second peak would represent the monomeric species of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (35.8 kDa), in well agreement with the reported result (8). We also collected the fractions representing these two elution peaks and analysed them by SDS\u2013PAGE, and the corresponding protein bands further indicated that both of these two peaks are SARS-CoV 3CLpro (data not shown). The amount of the dimer and monomer could be further quantified by the integrated area values of these two peaks and the dimer/monomer ratio of the wild type protease was estimated as 1.02 (Table 3). This observation thus indicates that in solution the wild type protease exhibits both forms of monomer and dimer and the amount of the monomer is almost equal to that of the dimeric form, in well agreement with the chemical cross-linking analysis and literature report (13).\n",

The results demonstrate that dimerization of SARS-CoV 3CLpro could not be disrupted entirely by mutation of single residue on the dimer interface, further supporting the chemical cross-linking results. Compared with the wild type protease, these mutants showed minor drifts on the retention volumes of the two elution peaks (Table 3, varying from 43.4 ml to 45.8 ml and from 59.2 ml to 63.4 ml), indicative of possible subtle conformational changes of the dimer and monomer structures. Furthermore, the dimer/monomer ratios of these mutants differentiated significantly from each other (Table 3), implying that the contributions of these residues to the monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium of SARS-CoV 3CLpro are quite different. For the Ser1_Ala, Phe3_Ala and Ser139_Ala mutants, the ratios between the dimers and monomers were 1.08, 0.93 and 0.81, respectively, which indicates that these three residues could only affect the dimer interface stability to a lesser extent. For the other mutants, especially the Arg4_Ala and Glu14_Ala mutants, the dimer/monomer ratios decreased obviously and were nearly 2 to 3-fold lower than that of the wild type protease, suggesting that the amount of the dimer has decreased and the monomer is the predominant form. Overall, Glu14, Arg4, Phe140 and Ser10 (in decreasing order) on the dimer interface are the relatively more critical residues for stabilizing the dimeric structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.",

Meanwhile, alteration of the correct conformation of the dimeric structure could also lead to a complete loss of the catalytic activity (8, 14). Although Ala replacement of single residue on the dimer interface could not completely result in the dimer dissociation in solution, the seven residues we selected still might affect the catalytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro considering their contributions to stabilize the monomer\u2013monomer interface. To verify this prediction, we determined the enzymatic activities of the wild type and seven mutated proteases by a fluorogenic substrate reported previously in our lab (23, 24). The catalytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro and relevant inhibitors screening have been characterized extensively by the FRET-based assay (26, 31\u201333). As shown in Fig. 7, the fluorescence increase following hydrolysis of the substrate by the wild type SARS-CoV 3CLpro is significant and time-dependent, implying that the protease could hydrolyze the substrate efficiently. As expected, the fluorescence profiles of the seven mutants were obviously different from that of the wild type protease (Fig. 7), which indicates that mutation of these residues could inactivate the catalytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro to varying extents. In detail, mutation of residues Ser10 and Phe140 almost produced the complete loss of the enzymatic activity and the catalytic activities of the Phe3_Ala, Glu14_Ala and Arg4_Ala mutants were also decreased to only 4\u201310% of that of the wild type protease (Table 4). While the mutants of Ser1_Ala and Ser139_Ala still possessed 46 and 58% of enzymatic activity, respectively. (Table 4). These results further support the conclusions derived from the SEC analyses that the extensive monomer\u2013monomer interactions regulated by these residues could stabilize the dimeric structure at different degrees. However, it is noticeable that the influence of these mutations on the catalytic activity is more obvious than that on dimerization of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, which will be discussed below.\n",

Therefore 3CLpro has been appreciated as an attractive target in discovering anti-coronavirus agents (5). SARS-CoV 3CLpro shares high homology with the 3CLpros of other coronaviruses, and the 3D structures of different coronavirus 3CLpros are more conserved than their sequences (6, 37). SARS-CoV 3CLpro has been extensively characterized for its structural property and enzymatic activity (8, 9, 12\u201315, 27, 38, 39). The protease can form a homodimer in crystal and solution (Fig. 1A and B), and the dimeric structure is proposed to be indispensable for enzymatic activity. Much progress has been made for understanding the correlation between dimerization and catalytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (7\u201310, 12, 27, 30). Recently a systematic mutagenesis study reported an initial attempt to map the dimerization interface on the helical domain III of the protease (11).",

            "text": "In the present study, we focused another seven residues on the dimer interface of SARS-CoV 3CLpro for single point mutagenesis (Fig. 1A). These selected residues are predicted to involve in dimerization mainly through hydrogen bonding (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Structurally, the seven mutated proteases could be divided into three groups. The first group includes Ser1_Ala, Phe3_Ala and Arg4_Ala mutants regarding three residues on the N-terminal finger of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The N-terminal finger of one monomer can form intensive interactions with domain II of the other monomer (6) (Fig. 2A), e.g. the NH group of Ser1 in monomer B donates hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl of Phe140 in monomer A, as well as the side-chain carboxylate of Glu166A; and the side-chain OH group of Ser1B forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain NH group of Phe140A. In addition, the NH group of Phe3B donates a hydrogen bond to the side-chain OH group of Ser139A. This pair of hydrogen bond might be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the side-chain phenyl of Phe3B and the neighbouring residues, e.g. Leu282B and Phe291B. Whereas replacement of residue Ser1 or Phe3 by Ala rendered little influence on the dimer\u2013monomer equilibrium of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Fig. 5B, C and Table 3), indicating that these two residues might not play a vital role in dimerization. The results are in agreement with a reported study that the N-terminal residues1\u20133 truncated protease still exhibits a tendency to form dimer (9). The Ser1_Ala mutant maintained 46% of enzymatic activity and the activity of the Phe3_Ala mutant was nearly 10-fold lower than that of the wild type protease (Table 4), implying that in addition to dimerization, residues Ser1 and Phe3 could regulate the catalytic activity of the protease by other mechanisms. According to the crystal structure (Fig. 2A), the monomer\u2013monomer interactions mediated by Ser1 and Phe3 might be helpful to maintain the correct catalytic conformation of the S1 subsite, and mutation of Ser1 or Phe3 possibly induces an altered uncompetitive conformation of the S1 subsite. Nevertheless, this hypothesis should be verified by the crystal structures determination of these two mutated proteases. Besides Ser1 and Phe3, another residue Arg4 was also selected for mutagenesis study. The side-chain guanidyl of Arg4 in one monomer forms a salt bridge with the side-chain of Glu290 in the other monomer (Fig. 2A), which has been reported as one of the major interactions between the two monomers (12). Here, Arg4_Ala mutant was shown to a tendency to monomer state (Table 3) and a very weak enzymatic activity (Table 4), further demonstrating the importance of the Arg4-mediated interactions in the quaternary structure and activity of the protease. Although the role of the N-terminal finger has been assessed by many investigations (9, 10), our results revealed that the residues on the N-terminal finger indeed contribute differently to the dimer stability and catalytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.",

The two residues are highly conserved among different coronavirus 3CL proteases and also extensively involved in monomer\u2013monomer interactions (Fig. 1C). Residue Ser10 from each monomer can form a pair of hydrogen bond between the main-chain NH group and the side-chain OH group, and the side-chain carboxylate of Glu14 in one monomer donates a hydrogen bond with the main-chain NH group of Gly11 in the other monomer (Fig. 2B). In the present study, both of the two mutants were shown to weak dimerization (Fig. 5E\u2013F and Table 3) and have no detectable enzyme activity either (Table 4), indicating that the \u03b1-helix A\u2032 of domain I might also be a critical region for dimerization. Structurally, the \u03b1-helix A\u2032 (residues Ser10-Gly15) connects to the N-terminal finger of SARS-CoV 3CLpro and might determine the correct spatial orientation of the N-terminal finger (Fig. 2B). In the dimer structure, the N-terminal finger can squeeze into the space between domain III of its parent monomer and domain II of the neighbouring monomer, which is indispensable for maintaining the correct catalytic conformation of the protease (6, 8). Mutation of Ser10 or Glu14 to Ala is possible to partly disrupt the structure of the \u03b1-helix A\u2032 and produce a mis-oriented N-terminal finger, thus making the protease completely inactive. However, this conclusion should be further confirmed by the crystal structures of the corresponding mutated proteases (unpublished data from this laboratory).",

            "text": "In addition, we also performed another group of mutants including Ser139_Ala and Phe140_Ala. These two residues are located in the oxyanion loop (residues 138\u2013145) of domain II and involved in the dimer interface by interacting with the N-terminus residues of the other monomer (Fig. 2A). The oxyanion loop is associated with the formation of the S1 subsite in the substrate-binding pocket, which determines the absolute specificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro for Glu in the P1 position of the substrate (6, 14). The oxyanion loop is very flexible and a rearrangement of its correct conformation could induce the collapse of the oxyanion hole (Gly143-Ser144-Cys145) in the S1 subsite, therefore, inactivate the protease completely (14). The Ser139_Ala mutant showed only a minor difference in the monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium with the wild type protease (Table 3), implying that the contribution of residue Ser139 to dimerization is not dominant. While the Ser139_Ala mutant preserved only 50% of the wild type activity (Table 4), which indicates that mutation of Ser139 might directly affect the catalysis, most probably by altering the conformation of the oxyanion loop. Although Phe140 donated hydrogen bonds to Ser1 through its main-chain groups, the Phe140_Ala mutant still had an obvious trend to the monomer state (Table 3). It is possible that the hydrophobic packing between the side-chain phenyl of Phe140 and the residues nearby (e.g. His163, His172) would also stabilize the Phe140\u2013Ser1 interactions (Fig. 2A). Meanwhile, mutation of Phe140 completely abolished the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Table 4), further suggesting that the interactions mediated by Phe140 might also contribute well to maintain the conformational stability of the S1 subsite (14).",

Since the dimeric structure has been proved to be indispensable for enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, it is easy to understand the conclusion of no dimer, no activity. In this study, some residues have been revealed to be important for both dimerization and activity. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV 3CLpro is a very flexible protein and the correct conformation state might also be vital for the protease to maintain its full activity. Thus, in addition to dimer dissociation, an altered conformation of the substrate-binding pocket possibly induced by single mutation on the dimer interface could also make the protease inactive. Our future study should be focused on determining the crystal structures of these mutated proteases, which will shed more light on understanding the dimerization-activity relationship of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.",
