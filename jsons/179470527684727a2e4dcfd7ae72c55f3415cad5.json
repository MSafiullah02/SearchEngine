Although interventional radiology (IR) is not among the leading forces in the fight against the virus, IR remains an important part of healthcare systems. Therefore, it is necessary that appropriate IR services can also be provided under these extreme circumstances. Such services include critical emergency interventions, such as embolization procedures to treat hemorrhage, and endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke. In addition, depending on the specific circumstances, oncology patients and cases of critical limb ischemia also need urgent treatment. However, the current outbreak may find some IR services unprepared to safely perform these important services. In this document, preemptive measures and potential challenges that are most relevant to the practice of IR are described based on the experience of an IR unit deeply affected by COVID-19.",

The high viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples indicate that virus transmission via respiratory secretions, in the form of droplets ([ 5 l) or aerosols (\\ 5 l), may be most likely [2] . Surfaces contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them represent another way of contamination [2] . Viable virus could be detected in aerosols up to 3 h post-aerosolization; its half-life on surfaces seems to depend on the contaminated surfaces. Laboratory tests reveal viable virus up to 4 h on copper, up to 24 h on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel [3] .",

This also accounts for patients who are referred for an IR procedure. There is a need for decentralization of services and segregation of patients in response to the risk of nosocomial transmission of infection. Execution of IR procedures in situations with suspected airborne infections needs particular precautions to reduce the risk of transmission to the healthcare workers. As far as possible, procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection should be performed at a specially designed isolation facility. In our hospital, every patient and healthcare worker has to undergo RT-PCR testing (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from COVID-19. Uncertain cases are managed as infected ones, and healthcare workers with suspected infection are kept away from the hospital (preventive quarantine). Luckily this has not been required yet, perhaps in part due to attention to these recommendations and guidelines.",

The same scheme has been adopted for interventional radiologists: per week only 5 (2 for neuro and 3 for body) go to the hospital where they cover IR procedures and replace the peripherally inserted central catheter (Picc) team for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (Picc team is now employed in ''COVID-area'').

Based on the available evidence, and as reported above, the COVID-19 virus is transmitted between people through close contact and droplets, exposure to particles in the air, or after touching contaminated objects and surfaces [2] . Consultation with local epidemiology expertise should be undertaken to assess the status of current suite ventilation, and whether positive, negative, filtered, or recirculating air is present. Such knowledge can assist in the development of specific and standardized workflow protocols that match the ventilation requirements to the degree of specific isolation. That being said, COVID isolation in the angiosuites may not require dedicated extra ventilation systems. However, high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration systems in the angiographic suites may represent the best way to protect staff. Dedicated negative pressure rooms with air filtration may be ideal for COVID, especially in procedure rooms, but potentially also in waiting rooms, bathrooms and soiled equipment or decontamination rooms, when feasible.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of appropriate PPE for standard, contact and airborne precautions [4] ( Fig. 2A-C) . Aerosol-generating procedures usually performed in an angiographic suite may include biopsy, fine needle aspiration, insertion of nasogastric or naso-jejunal feeding tubes, percutaneous gastrostomy, esophageal, gastric or duodenal dilatation and/or stenting, tracheal dilatation and/or stenting, and bronchial artery embolization (for the risk of heavy bouts of coughing due to hemoptysis) [5] . For thoracentesis or paracentesis sample preparations, transfer should be avoided, or if absolutely necessary, be performed with needle tip below fluid surfaces to minimize aerosolization. When carrying out these procedures on Covid-19 patients, the WHO recommends N95 or FFP2 standard masks or equivalent, and gowns, gloves, eye protection, aprons and shoe covers [4, 6] . N95 masks are equivalent to PPE masks, designed to achieve a very close facial fit and protect the wearer from airborne particles; they are tested to block at least 95% of very small (0.3 l) test particles. FFP2 masks have a minimum of 94% filtration of particles (0.4 l) percentage (Fig. 3) .

The doors of the positive pressure interventional suite must be closed during the entire procedure to prevent contamination. To minimize the in and out movement from the potentially contaminated room, the staff must remain close to the angiographic table with PPE and sterile equipment. A radiographer, with full PPE but non-sterile, could help control the angiographic table and any additional equipment. One or two more staff members, a radiographer and/ or a nurse, may be stationed outside the angiographic room to help and assist the staff in the room (communication should be done by microphone, if available), without room to room travel.",

Viable virus was detected in a lab setting in the air 3 h post-aerosolization and up to 6 h later on copper, 24 h on cardboard, and 2-3 days on stainless steel or plastic such as polypropylene. Aerosol virus half-life was 2.7 h, while the half-life on steel was 13 h and 16 h on plastic. This information may have profound implications for room decontamination between IR procedures, surgery, or even imaging, but it remains unclear how this might specifically translate into decontamination practices or standard operating procedures [3] .

The US machine must be completely protected with clear transparent plastic before it enters the patient's room.

Sterile probe cover should be carefully placed, with attention to reduction of contamination risk, or 2 probe covers may be used.
