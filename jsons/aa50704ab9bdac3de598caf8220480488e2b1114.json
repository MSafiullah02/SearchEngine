SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus whose genome presents several potential antiviral targets. These include non-structural proteins (e.g., 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, papain-like protease, RNAdependent RNA polymerase and its helicase), structural proteins (e.g., the capsid spike glycoprotein), and accessory proteins (1).

The spectrum of disease varies, but comorbid conditions confer a 2.85 to 21.4-fold increased risk of in-hospital mortality (2) . Therefore, it was surprising to see a relatively benign course in our patient given his immunocompromised state and complex cardiovascular history. Since the majority of patients with COVID-19 will have mild symptoms and recover, it is likely that this applies to our patient as well, but we hypothesize that LVAD support and ART reduced the severity of COVID-19 manifestation in our vulnerable patient through its immunomodulatory effects.",

The mechanism(s) producing myocardial injury in COVID-19 disease are debatable, but include ischemia, resulting in either type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction, injury from decompensated heart failure, or the direct result of viral myocarditis. Our patient had mild elevations in cardiac enzymes that were diagnostic of injury and fell within the interquartile range of troponin-I as reported in the cohort from Wuhan, China (3).

These findings suggest that HIV-induced inflammation increases mortality risk among HIV patients and that interrupting ART further increases this risk (6) .

Most were receiving ART. This compares to 6 of 28 healthcare workers with similar exposure who did contract SARS. This observation leads to a hypothesis that existing HIV infection might interfere with SARS virus replication in the same host or that ART might prevent SARS development (7) . These initial observations were supported by a retrospective matched cohort study from Hong Kong where the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir, a protease inhibitor, to standard SARS treatment protocols appeared to be associated with improved clinical outcomes (8) .",
