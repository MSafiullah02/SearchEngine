Contrary to popular belief, this genus is probably the best classified of all bacterial genera. This is due to a number of excellent individual taxonomic studies and also to the cooperative investigations of the International Working Group for Mycobacterial Taxonomy. The genus can be divided into two distinct subgenera-the rapid growers and the slow growers. Antigenic analysis and DNA studies show that these two groups of species are quite distinct and are probably due to a major evolutionary split occurring very early in the evolution of the genus. The rapid growers show a considerable antigenic overlap with the genus Nocardia.",

There is also a considera-ble amount of evidence from experimental and clinical studies showing that the two phenomena are dissociable and that a high degree of tuberculin hypersensitivity is antagonistic to protection in a systemic disease.* Rook and Stanford'\" noted that strains of mice that develop low levels of tuberculin hypersensitivity are relatively resistant to intravenous inoculations of M. tuberculosis but are susceptible to intradermal challenges. The reverse is true for animals that develop high levels of tuberculin hypersensitivity. The same authors also demonstrated that mycobacterial infections in mice elicited at least two distinct immunologic reactions, both of which produced positive tuberculin tests.

In some cases noncaseating tuberclelike granulomas with Langhans giant cells are seen, while in others the infiltrate is more diffuse. Acid-fast bacilli are very scanty but occasionally are seen within epitheliod cells. In older lesions, in the resolving stage, nonspecific aggregates of lymphocytes and fibrous tissue are present. Lesions show parakeratosis or hyperkeratosis, and in some cases ulceration and secondary infection is evident. Ultrastructural studies have shown that the granulomas are of the high-turnover type of immunogenic origin.*'",
