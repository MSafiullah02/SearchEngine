However, it remains unclear which host factors drive these processes. A better understanding of the host factors associated with severe disease is clinically important; it may help discover pathogenic pathways that determine disease progression and enable researchers to identify new therapeutic targets. Identifying new therapeutic targets is particularly important given that currently available antiviral therapy (e.g., neuraminidase inhibitors) has limited efficacy in reducing influenza-related fatality. Therefore, delineating influenza-related host factors is a critical first step in improving patient outcome in influenza infection. Here, we examine the host factors underpinning both innate and adaptive immune response to influenza virus (Box 35.1).",

Innate immunity provides a vital bridge between first exposure of the na\u00efve host and subsequent elaboration of specific antibody and T-cell responses, which is extremely important for clearing virus. Viral RNA is recognized through a variety of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7, TLR8, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG)-I and nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein (NLRP)3. Once viral RNA is recognized by PRRs, pro-inflammatory cytokines are secreted, such as type I interferons (IFNs), which induce an antiviral state in neighboring cells. Cytokine secretion leads to the recruitment of innate immune cells, which instruct the adaptive immune response for specific killing of influenzainfected cells [4] .",

Infection with influenza virus induces differentiation of effector CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, however the contribution of CD4 + T cells to virus clearance is minor, compared to CD8 + T cells. In influenza infection, the primary role of CD4 + T cells involves supporting the activation and differentiation of B cells, leading to antibody production, and memory responses. Effector CD8 + T cells are major players in viral clearance and are essential for elimination of infected cells [22] . CD8 + effector T cells mediate viral clearance through three distinct mechanisms. First, CD8 + T cells can induce lysis of infected cells through exocytosis of perforin and granzyme containing granules. Second, CD8 + T cells can trigger TNF receptor (TNFR) family-dependent apoptosis in infected or stressed cells through either Fas ligand or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Third, when encountered with virus-infected cells, CD8 + T cells can produce pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IFN-\u03b3, which is important for viral clearance [21] .",

A key question is, among these host factors identified, which host factor is primarily responsible for influencing disease progression? Several studies have addressed this question. A study by Brandes et al. evaluated all the common host factors implicated in influenza pathogenesis [7] . From this evaluation, the authors discovered that a neutrophil-driven response was the most dominant host factor in disease progression. Notably, the authors identified a neutrophil-driven inflammatory loop that could directly amplify tissue damage and exacerbate inflammation. Thus, the authors concluded that excessive neutrophil activation was the main host factor associated with poor outcome in influenza infection.",

[8] examined neutrophil influx into the infected lung after influenza infection. Their findings confirmed that neutrophils were primarily responsible for causing immunopathology, lung inflammation and subsequently the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Importantly, the authors further discovered that neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation correlated with tissue damage. By examining lung histopathology and NET activity, they found that NETs directly caused tissue damage to alveoli, epithelium and the vascular structure in the infected lung. Thus, this study provides strong etiological evidence that aberrant or excessive neutrophil response was the dominant causative factor in severe influenza.",

Thus, it was uncertain whether the mechanistic findings obtained from these studies could be applied to infected humans. Two recent human studies have been performed to address this issue. A study by Dunning et al. examined the host response profile in 131 influenza infected humans (with either H1N1 or H3N2 influenza virus). The patient cohort include those with mild infection (n = 47), moderate infection (n = 34) and severe infection (n = 28) [23] . The findings of this study confirmed previous animal studies; they showed that neutrophil response was the primary host factor in determining the course of illness. Indeed, an excessive neutrophil response was consistently found in most patients with severe disease. Another study by Guan et al. investigated the host response profile of severe influenza infection, using a small case-series of patients with severe H7N9 infection [24] . This study also identified neutrophil response as the most critical factor in severe disease. Collectively, these human studies confirm findings from previous animal studies and pinpoint an aberrant neutrophil response as the main cause of disease progression in influenza infection.",

            "text": "Influenza virus likely interacts with systemic host factors (e.g., circulating neutrophils) during the course of infection. Unravelling this interaction is key to understanding influenza pathogenesis and, in particular, to exploring the mechanism by which influenza infection evolves from lung inflammation to multiorgan failure. Most influenza infection begins in airway and the infection spreads locally to other parts of the lung. The mechanism by which the virus interacts with local immune cells is well studied and much of the molecular/cellular details have already been elucidated. By contrast, the mechanism by which influenza virus interacts with host factors outside the lung, such as circulating immune cells, remains relatively unknown. This is largely due to the established dogma that influenza virus does not circulate outside the lung and, by extension, influenza virus is not expected to interact with circulating immune cells (e.g., neutrophils). This 'lung-centric' paradigm has recently been challenged by new evidence. Several studies showed that influenza virus can indeed be carried by immune cells from lung to non-lung tissues [25] [26] [27] . These 'virus carrying' immune cells include professional antigen presenting cells such as monocytes, macrophage and dendritic cells [28] [29] [30] . These cells pick up influenza virus RNA during their encountering and processing of virus infected cells (e.g., epithelium) in the early phase of infection ( Fig. 35.1 ). After processing of dead/ infected cells, these cells carry influenza virus RNA within them, migrate towards local draining lymph nodes and subsequently into the systemic circulation.",

Both direct and indirect processes may extend beyond the infected lung, since 'carrier' immune cells can transport influenza virus transcriptome to distant organs where a further encounter with recruited neutrophils may trigger local release of NETs into the affected organs. Indeed, in animal models, influenza virus transcriptome can be detected in major organs in the infected host (heart, spleen, kidney, brain, liver) [32] . Furthermore, a recent study showed that neutrophils can be infected by influenza virus [33] . Once infected, these neutrophils become 'carrier' immune cells themselves. They then go on to spread neutrophil-induced inflammation (e.g., NETs, myeloperoxidase, reactive oxygen species) elsewhere or allow actively replicating virions to 'seed' the target organs. Collectively, both direct and indirect tissue injury mechanisms extend an initially lung-centered pathology to other major organs with the ensuing development of organ dysfunction (e.g., myocarditis, acute kidney injury). In light of this, the traditional 'lung-centric' view of influenza pathogenesis requires revision to incorporate a multisystem view of organ dysfunction influenza pathogenesis (Fig. 35.3 ).",
