            "text": "and several airlines canceling flights to and from Chinadisrupting tourism and other business activitiesthe economic impact of the novel coronavirus is already extending beyond the borders of Hubei. This impact is quite obvious in the rattled stock market. 6-8 It is quite interesting how the lockdown of a province with a population just a bit less than that of France or the UK has threatened to be a blow to the global economy. This could be said to be amplified by the thorough integration of China, the second-largest economy behind the US, with the rest of the world. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in China from 2002 to 2003, the global economy was estimated to have lost roughly $40 billion. 9 Currently, as China has an economy 8 to 9 times larger than it had during the SARS epidemic, and is even more connected to the rest of the world, experts believe that the total impact of the 2019-nCoV on global economy could be quite huge. 4 As China now contributes approximately 16.3% of the world's GDP, the country has been the main growth driver worldwide, with the IMF estimating that China alone accounted for 39% of global economic growth in 2019. 10 This implies that any slowdown in the nation's economy could likely send waves across the global economy. 11 Figure 1 presents the growth of China's GDP and its share of the global GDP from 2003 to 2018. When China reopened its essential businesses on Monday, February 3, 2020, the markets dropped sharply in value due to the extended Lunar New Year holidays. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 7.7%, shedding about $375 billion in market value in its steepest 1-day decline since August 2015. The Shenzhen Composite also experienced an 8.4% decline in value. Other business sectors, retail, consumer services, and transportation stocks too led the declines. 12 According to IHS Markit Automotive, 11 of the Chinese provinces which are on strict lockdown account for more than two-thirds of vehicle production in the country. These provinces equally supply auto-parts to carmakers in the US, Europe, and South Korea. If the manufacturing companies remain idle until February 10, 2020, the experts believe that there could be production loss of about 350 000 units. This figure could skyrocket to over 1.7 million units if the outbreak situation continues until mid-March, equating to about 32.3% decline from precrisis expectations. 13 Similarly, S&P believes the nation's auto-parts production could suffer up to a 50% decline. Some carmakers have already expressed concerns over the shortage of car parts. Hyundai has reported the shutdown of its domestic factories after running out of parts from China. The managers of various carmakers in the US and Europe have also expressed concerns over the likely disruptions in business if China does not resume a full supply of parts to them within a week. 14 According to industry consultant LMC Automotive, China's auto market will shrink 3% to 5% in 2020 if the coronavirus outbreak continues into the second quarter. 15 Aside the automotive industry, tourism across the world has been affected gravely due to the outbreak, as China is recognized by the United Nation Tourism Organization (UNWTO) as a true leader in global tourism, both as a source market and as a leading destination. 16 The China Outbound Tourism Research Institute observed that 6.3 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad during the 2019 Lunar New Year holiday, generating travel revenue of around $73 billion, but the figures have reduced drastically in 2020.",
