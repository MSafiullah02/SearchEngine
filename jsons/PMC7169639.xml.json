By removing trainees from clinical settings, medical programs hope to reduce the risk of person-to-person infectious spread. Nevertheless, as this unprecedented pandemic continues to develop, more trainees and healthcare providers (HCP) will be required to treat infected patients, and proper training will be key to protecting their safety.1 Fortunately, simulation-based medical education (SBME) is a quickly expanding tool within medical training that has made great advances in recent years. In particular, SBME has been lauded for its improvement of medical education, coupled with cost savings and protection of patients.2",

In the United States, governors in states that are COVID-19 hotspots have recently modified laws regarding medical trainees during this pandemic.2,3 These governors have suspended the usual record-keeping requirements, relaxing restrictions on practice for medical and nursing students and asking medical trainees to support the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Universally, this pandemic presents a learning opportunity for students and practicing HCP to improve the healthcare system\u2019s response to unprecedented public health concerns. Yet for students, COVID-19 also presents a unique health risk. With medical trainees being called upon to become more involved with COVID-19 care teams, the trade-off between education and HCP safety starts to blur. Despite use of personal protective equipment (PPE), COVID-19 has been documented with asymptomatic human-to-human viral transmission,3 implicating high risk of infection for all HCP working with any patient, regardless of symptoms at the time.",

A recent study was published utilizing a simulation mannequin to analyze the effectiveness of PPE during the COVID-19 outbreak and to subsequently adjust PPE standards accordingly.4 From proper donning of PPE to patient management, simulation allows trainees to adhere to the public gathering bans being enforced by local governments and continue their medical education. This can be accomplished through eliminating human contact at simulation centres, remotely distributing virtual reality technology currently utilized in anatomy education, and/or integrating virtual simulation programs into online curricula.5",

While physicians are well-trained professionals, medical students find themselves in unfamiliar territory daily. Just as every medical student must learn how to avoid contamination of the sterile surgical field prior to entering the operating room, these incoming residents now require proper training to ensure their patients\u2019 safety and, equally important, their own. Whereas most SBME has been focused on teaching students the technical aspects of patient care and is traditionally used for code situations such as cardiac arrest or respiratory failure, its capacity to train HCP for their protection is seldom explored. Now, more than ever, it is critical that our medical schools and hospitals look to modern simulation practices to train our HCP not only on how to keep patients alive, but also on how to properly keep HCP themselves safe while working within this crisis.",
