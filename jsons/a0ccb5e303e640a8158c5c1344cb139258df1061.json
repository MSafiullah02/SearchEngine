Some recent emerging and re-emerging viral zoonoses include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, rabies virus, avian influenza viruses (AIV), Nipah virus, Hendra virus, hantaviruses, and West Nile virus. The two strains of HIV, HIV-1, and HIV-2, evolved from two simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) carried by the chimpanzee and Sooty mangabey, respectively (Bengis et al. [2004] ). Outbreaks of Ebola virus in humans have been associated with disease in chimpanzees, and the 2003 SARS outbreak originated from the masked palm civet (Bengis et al. [2004] ). The source of Nipah and Hendra viral outbreaks have been traced to bats, whereas hantaviruses are carried by wild rodents, primarily rats and mice (Bengis et al.

Mathematical models of infectious diseases in wildlife have been used to increase our understanding of these mechanisms and to test hypotheses about effective methods for prevention and control of infectious diseases in wildlife and humans. The collection of work in the books edited by Grenfell and Dobson [1995] and Hudson et al. [2002] summarizes some of these modeling efforts. Our goals are to provide FIGURE 1. Zoonotic viruses infect animal hosts and spill over into humans. a review of some of the mathematical modeling frameworks developed for the study of viral zoonoses in wildlife and to provide references for more detailed analyses. A recent survey of 442 modeling studies of zoonotic pathogens by Lloyd-Smith et al. [2009] found few dynamical models that account for multi-host pathogens, multiple pathogens, within-host pathogen dynamics in zoonotic transmission and pathogen evolution. In this review, we highlight these gaps and others in the modeling process that need to be filled to address important questions about viral zoonoses in wildlife. We examine some of the factors governing viral maintenance and transmission in the primary animal reservoir, how these factors have been accounted for in mathematical models and where additional modeling efforts are needed.",

When the disease is maintained in the reservoir population, the stages are cyclic (1) \u2192 (2) \u2192 (3) \u2192 (4) \u2192 (1). A viral infection begins with contact or exposure of an animal host with a particular pathogen. At the first stage, environmental conditions including climate, seasonality, anthropogenic disturbances, landscape, and resources (i.e., habitat, food, water) may individually or collectively determine whether there is contact between host and pathogen (Altizer et al. [2006] , Previtali et al. [2010] ). In addition, the host's intrinsic characteristics, its population and social structure, mobility, behavior, and susceptibility may modulate the extent of its exposure. In the second stage, the within-host and cellular level, the virus must FIGURE 2. Four stages that lead to disease transmission and maintenance in an animal reservoir. overcome physical barriers of the host, and must be compatible with cell receptors to gain entry into a target cell. After viral entry, the third stage, viral replication depends on host and viral genetics as well as host factors, such as the immune response, prior exposure, nutritional status, co-infection, age, sex, and reproductive status. Establishment of an infection in one host does not necessarily mean transmission to another host, as it may be a dead-end host. Transmission, the fourth stage of infection, depends on viral load, mode of viral shedding, host factors, and the community intra-and inter-host ecological interactions. These latter interactions are also affected by the spatial environment and anthropogenic factors.",

Mathematical models and techniques developed for spread of disease in humans often apply to wildlife populations but there are key differences. For example, the wildlife reservoir has adapted to the specific viral infection while this is not the case for humans. In addition, environmental effects and anthropogenic disturbances have a much greater impact on diseases in wildlife than in humans. Mathematical models developed for diseases of wildlife often concentrate on the population level, omitting steps (2) and (3) (Grenfell and Dobson [1995] , Hudson et al. [2002] ). Preventive and control measures (e.g., vaccination or culling) are often studied in terms of stages (1) and (4), whereas the effectiveness of treatment strategies (e.g., drug treatment) are studied within stages (2) and (3). In Section 3, we summarize some of the mathematical modeling efforts for stages (1) and (4), and models for stages (2) and (3) in Section 4.",

            "text": "Although the within-host and population dynamics are often modeled separately, host-pathogen interactions at the within-host level can influence the dynamics of the system at the population level in a number of ways. The pathogen may alter the host by changing its reproductive, movement or social behavior (Murray et al. [1986] , Murray and Seward [1992] , Klein et al. [2004 ], van Gils et al. [2007 ). A pathogen may shorten the host lifespan, e.g., H5N1 influenza virus in chickens (Chen et al. [2006] ). A better understanding of the behavior of the pathogen within-host will lead to better models and more accurate parameterization for host-pathogen interactions on a population or evolutionary level (Mideo et al. [2008] ). For instance, knowledge of within-host biology tells us if we need to address time since infection or changes in immunity, persistently infectious individuals versus short-term infection resulting in recovery and possibly immunity. Host biology may tell us that infectivity is agedependent or that infection alters behavior, e.g., hantavirus infection in male rodents increases aggression (Klein et al. [2004] ), rabies infection in foxes increases erratic movement (Murray and Seward [1992] , Murray et al. [1986] ), low pathogenic avian influenza infection in swans delays migration (van Gils et al. [2007] ). Host or pathogen biology may differ in space or time (seasonality) and the environment may play a significant role in the contact process, especially in an animal reservoir, e.g., spatial overlap of habitats leading to spill over of hantavirus infection in rodents (Allen et al. [2009] ). Multiple hosts may amplify or dilute the pathogen effects or multiple pathogen co-infection may decrease the effectiveness of the immune response. That is, increased biodiversity in bird species reduces spillover of West Nile virus in humans (Swaddle and Calos [2008] ), reduced species diversity increases infection prevalence of Sin Nombre virus in deer mice (Dizney and Ruedas [2009] ), micro-and macro-parasitic co-infection induces antagonistic immune responses (Fenton et al. [2008] ). In summary, the within-host biology leads to a particular choice of model at the population level, such as an SI model with susceptible and infectious stages or an SIR model with susceptible, infectious, recovered and immune stages. Alternately, an SI 1 I 2 model with susceptible and two infectious stages could be applied if the infection modifies the behavior of some individuals, such as those in infectious stage 2 but not stage 1. These types of models are discussed in more detail in the following sections.",

The contact or exposure of a host to a pathogen is often built on the premise of homogenous mixing in epidemiological models. The most common epidemiological models are SIR models, which are the basis for many population-based disease models (e.g., Anderson and May [1992] , Grenfell and Dobson [1995] , Hethcote [2000] , Hudson et al. [2002] , , Keeling and Rohani [2008] ). For wildlife populations, births and deaths, sex-specific behavior, and sickness-related behavior may affect exposure or transmission success. Spatial structure of the population accounts for contacts that may depend on spatial proximity or habitat heterogeneity. Environmental variability and anthropogenic disturbances are also important factors affecting successful transmission. Interactions within and between different species may lead to an amplification or a dilution effect, resulting in either spatial expansion or contraction of the disease (Schmidt and Ostfeld [2001] , Keesing et al.

The flow diagram of an SIR model, S \u2192 I \u2192 R, means a susceptible individual becomes infectious then recovers and is immune. The model is the same as the well-known SIR epidemic model, but the term \"epizootic\" is used in place of \"epidemic\" to emphasize that we are applying these models to outbreaks in animal populations. The term epizootic refers to a single outbreak, whereas enzootic implies persistence of the disease in an animal population. If there is no immunity, then re-infection may occur and the model is known as an SIS model; whereas if immunity wanes, then the model is known as an SIRS model. The simplest type of model assumes homogeneous mixing. That is, all susceptible individuals are equally likely to become infectious depending on the number of contacts (c) per unit time of an infectious individual with other individuals in the population and the probability (q) that a contact results in an infection.",

But with mass action incidence, the total population density is reduced but does not go to zero (Figure 3 (c) and (d)). If there are no disease fatalities, then the population size remains constant. Many animal reservoirs that maintain the disease in the wild have adapted to the pathogen so that there are few, if any, disease-related mortalities; such is the case with hantavirus (Glass et al. [1998] ). This is a distinct difference between the animal reservoir and the spill-over infection. Disease-related mortalities are a more common occurrence in spill over infections, where animal hosts have not adapted to the pathogen.",

            "text": "The primary reason for the difference between mass action and standard incidences with disease fatalities is that with standard incidence, the number of contacts remains the same regardless of the population size or density, whereas in mass action incidence the number of contacts decreases as the population density decreases. For a few systems where data are available, either standard or mass action incidence, have provided reasonable fits to observed data in wildlife. For example, standard incidence was fit to feline leukemia virus (FeLV) data from feral cats (Fromont et al. [1997] ) and mass action incidence (plus transmission of the virus via the environment) was fit to avian influenza data from wild birds from the Camargue, France (Roche et al. [2009] ). Estimates for the transmission rate for FeLV were obtained from the \"time between the first contact with a contagious individual and the onset of infection\" (Fromont et al. [1997] , Pedersen et al. [1977] ). The reciprocal of this value gives an estimate of \u03b2 in the case of standard incidence ranging from 3.08 to 11.76 per year, with population densities ranging from 120 in rural settings to 1100 in urban settings (Fromont et al. [1997] ). The contact rates for avian influenza, reported in Roche et al. [2009] , were varied (with non transmission parameters kept fixed) to find the best fit of the model results to data. Contact rate was not calculated explicitly but the transmission rate was calculated. The value of N was in the region of 10 5 , large enough to use a deterministic model, and was calculated from ornithological data. Other possible incidence rates are discussed by McCallum et al. [2001] .",

When R 0 = 1 a critical carrying capacity can be defined, K T = (b + \u03b3 + \u03b1)/\u03b2, the minimal density needed for an outbreak. In stochastic epizootic models, there is also a concept of \"critical community size.\" This concept is not as well-defined as the population threshold N T or K T . It was first introduced by Bartlett [1957] in connection with measles outbreaks. The disease does not persist if the community size is too small. Only through introduction of new infectious individuals will there be another outbreak. Unlike the estimate for the probability of an outbreak, there is no distinct threshold for critical community size in stochastic models. Persistence of wildlife disease between epizootics depends on the length of the tail of the preceding outbreak, the number of animals that did not become infected and the rate the susceptible pool is replenished ).",

If the pathogen has little effect on the mortality of the reservoir host, such as in the case of hantaviruses, then it is more important to monitor the prevalence of infection I /N than to compute R 0 . When infection prevalence increases in the reservoir, then humans are more likely to come in contact with the infected reservoir population. Thus, it is infection prevalence rather than R 0 that is a determinant of risk in human infection. Infection prevalence may differ from animal abundance in that there may be a lag between abundance and infection (Davis et al. [2005] , ).",

[1997] , Galvani and May [2005] , Allen et al. [2006] , Klein and Calisher [2007] , , Banerjee et al. [2008] , Keeling and Rohani [2008] , Laverty and Adler [2009] ). Reproductive differences between species can be introduced through the birth rates, that is, births can occur at a constant rate through the year, as is often modeled for human populations (Anderson and May [1992] ), or as a seasonal pulse, which is often more probable in animal populations (Keeling and Rohani [2008] ). The former case will provide (assuming no vertical transmission) a constant stream of new susceptibles into the population, whereas seasonal births will provide an influx of new susceptibles at a given time each year. The implications can be a sudden change in the R 0 value for the population with a corresponding change in the level of vaccination required for herd immunity. Behavioral differences in the sexes where male rodents' aggressive behavior when infected with hantavirus (Klein and Calisher [2007] , Klein et al. [2004] ) and vertical transmission when infected with arenavirus were modeled in (Allen et al. [2006] , Banerjee et al. [2008] ). Analyses of the models revealed distinct thresholds that depend on these sexual differences. Age structure or age since infection can be accounted for in models through either discrete or continuous ages and through multiple infectious stages indicating time since infection (Keeling and Rohani [2008] ). Models with juveniles and adults whose behavioral differences may affect the disease dynamics have been considered in wildlife diseases, e.g., spread of rabies (Suppo et al. [2000] ) but data are limited on age-structure or times since infection in wildlife populations. Addressing the heterogeneity in the host population has not been well studied but it clearly has implications for the maintenance and spread of viral pathogens. The best illustration of the importance of heterogeneity in host response to pathogens is the incidence of superspreaders (Woolhouse et al. [1997] , Galvani and May [2005] ), in which 20% of a host population contributes to 80% of transmission (20/80 rule). Vertical transmission, virus spread from mother to offspring, has been included in models by assuming infectious females give birth to infectious offspring with a given probability (Busenberg and Cooke [1993] ).",

[1998 ], Suppo et al. [2000 , Allen et al. [2002 Allen et al. [ , 2009 , Arino et al. [2007] , Ding et al. [2007] , Foley et al. [1999] , Gudelj et al. [2004] , McCormack and Allen [2007] , Keeling and Rohani [2008] ). For example, in the case of rabies, baits laden with vaccine were deposited in strategic locations in Canada, the United States and Europe with the goal of stopping the spread of rabies in wildlife reservoirs, foxes, coyotes and raccoons; this has been modeled in (Allen et al. [2002] , Childs et al. [2007] , Coyne et al. [1989] , Ding et al. [2007] , Murray and Seward [1992] , Smith and Cheeseman [2002] , Suppo et al. [2000] , Tilman and Kareiva [1997] ). Childs et al. [2007] and Coyne et al. [1989] fit an SEIR model to spatial data on a raccoon rabies epizootic that occurred during the 1970s on the east coast of the United States. They found epizootic periods of 4-5 years and although recurrent epidemics declined in size, the model agreed most closely with an assumption of little or no immunity (Childs et al. [2007] ). They also used the model to evaluate culling versus vaccination as control measures for raccoon rabies and found that the most cost effective strategy involves culling over 32% of the raccoons or yearly vaccination of up to 99% of the population (Coyne et al. [1989] ). Smith and Cheeseman [2002] found that culling was more effective for disease elimination than vaccination for control of fox rabies in Europe. Such types of studies on disease spread, vaccination coverage and other methods for control of zoonotic diseases are immensely valuable for prevention of human infection and conservation of wildlife.",

Human-disturbed landscape and increased precipitation are associated with hantavirus infection in rodent reservoirs and high risk for humans (Glass et al. [2000] , Goodin et al. [2006] , Previtali et al. [2010] ). Persistence of the viral pathogen in the environment, outside the host, depends on temperature and humidity. Models for hantavirus with direct transmission and indirect transmission via the environment were considered in (Sauvage et al. [2003 (Sauvage et al. [ , 2007 , Wesley et al. [2010] , Wolf et al. [2006] ). Indirect transmission provides a means for the pathogen to persist when direct transmission is low. Long-distance migration in birds may impact disease susceptibility due to compromised immune function during migration Moore [2006, 2008] , Weber and Stilianakis [2007] ). A few studies have investigated migratory behavior of infected birds , van Gils et al. [2007] ) but these have not been mathematically modeled.",

A computational model for spread of H5N1 avian influenza among birds was developed based on phylogenetic data of virus isolates, migratory bird pathways and trade in poultry and wild birds (Kilpatrick et al. [2006] ). The model predicts global spread of H5N1, based on the location of H5N1 introductions in various countries. Remote sensing data on landscape and rainfall patterns have been applied to hantaviruses in rodents indicating significant relationships between geography, rainfall and disease in the reservoir (Glass et al. [1998 (Glass et al. [ , 2000 , Goodin et al. [2006] ). Satellite imagery of vegetation and data on precipitation and host and pathogen presence can be coupled to form risk maps (e.g., Glass et al. [1998 Glass et al. [ , 2000 , Goodin et al. [2006] , Hess et al. [2002] ). A review article by Clements and Pfeiffer [2010] summarizes some of the contributions of geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS) and spatially explicit modeling to human risk and intervention strategies with respect to rabies, West Nile virus, avian influenza and other emerging viral zoonoses. Mathematical models coupled with data from GIS and RS are \"powerful and cost-effective tools\" for assessing alternative control strategies (Clements and Pfeiffer [2010] ). The importance of space in animal disease ecology has been demonstrated theoretically but as noted by Steinberg and Karieva in reference to spatial ecology (Steinberg and Kareiva [1997] , p. 318):",

For standard incidence, the entries R j k do not depend on K j . In human diseases, a matrix known as the WAIFW matrix (who acquires infection from whom) (Anderson and May [1992] ) is often used to determine the contacts among different groups. Matrix M plays a similar role. Depending on the magnitude of the entries R j k the basic reproduction R 0 may either decrease or increase with multiple hosts, resulting in either an amplification effect or a dilution effect, respectively (Dobson [2004] , McCormack and Allen [2007] ). To eradicate infection in a wildlife reservoir, R 0 needs to be reduced below one. This may be accomplished through direct control of the reservoir population or possibly through one or more spill over species, especially if that species has an amplifying effect. Due to the large number of parameters, estimates of R 0 with multiple hosts is difficult. Alternative measures such as infection prevalence I j /N j may be more easily estimated from data and potentially more relevant for wildlife diseases (e.g., , Davis et al. [2005] ).",

The parameter \u03b1 j is a measure of pathogen virulence. The preceding result implies that it is to the pathogen's advantage to evolve to reduced virulence, that is, to evolve so that \u03b1 j is small and R j is large (Bremermann and Thieme [1989] , Levin and Pimentel [1981] ). A well-known natural experiment of myxoma virus in rabbits supports this hypothesis (Fenner and Ratcliffe [1965] , Fenner and Myers [1978] , Levin and Pimentel [1981] ). The European rabbit, introduced into Australia in the mid 1800s, rapidly increased to very high densities causing a serious problem to agriculture. To control the rabbit population, a lethal strain of myxoma virus was introduced in the mid 1950s. The initial mortality rate in infected rabbits was estimated at 99.8% (Fenner and Myers [1978] , Levin and Pimentel [1981] ). But over time, the mortality decreased, the virulence level of the virus decreased in the rabbit population. The relationship between reduced virulence and disease persistence is not as simple as a decrease in pathogen reproduction number with virulence, \u03b1 j (see e.g., Allen [2003, 2005] , Anderson and May [1992] , Bremermann and Thieme [1989] , Day [2002] , Day and Burns [2003] , Nowak [1994, 1995] , Pugliese [2002] ). The parameters in the definition of R j are generally not independent; for example, transmission may be correlated with virulence (Anderson and May [1992] , Bremermann and Thieme [1989] ).",

Co-infection of a host with several strains may lead to viral recombination and a new strain that is more virulent. This is one of the major concerns with avian influenza (Suarez et al. [2004] ). Superinfection occurs when pathogens can invade one another sequentially. With coinfection, superinfection, stochastic effects or density-dependent births instead of deaths, the competitive exclusion principle no longer holds (see e.g., Allen [2003, 2005] , Adler and Losada [2002] , , Castillo-Chavez and Velasco-Hernandez [1998] , Esteva and Vargas [2003] , May and Nowak [1995] , Mosquera and Adler [1998] , , Nowak and Sigmund [2002] , Pugliese [2002] ). In these latter cases, other factors in combination with the infection determine the outcome of the pathogen competition. In addition, calculation of thresholds becomes more complex and explicit expressions may not be possible. Only a few longitudinal co-infection studies have been conducted in natural nonhuman animal populations (e.g., Telfer et al. [2008 Telfer et al. [ , 2010 ).",

The immune system is very complex, involving many types of molecules, cells and chemicals (e.g., Murphy et al. [2008] , Perelson [2002] ). Two important cellular components of the adaptive immune response are B cells and T cells. The B cells are responsible for generation of antibody molecules and T cells are responsible for production of cytokines and killing of infected cells. In response to a viral pathogen, B cells are activated to produce antibodies, molecules specific to a particular virus particle. Antibodies bind to a specific virus particle so that it can be recognized and cleared by multiple mechanisms, including by macrophages, which can then present antigen to T cells. Natural killer cells also are activated by receptors on the surface of infected cells. They bind to these receptors and release chemicals inside the cell that may either kill the infected cell or cause the infected cell to stop replication of the virus particle. Helper T cells assist in both B cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation.",

[2009 ], Lee et al. [2009 ). In long-term infections, the immune response adapts to the persistent infection, caused by a down-regulation of the immune response (Sch\u00f6nrich et al. [2008] ). When a virus jumps to a naive host, the immune response may be very strong. For example, in some viral infections, the CTL response can lead to tissue damage and if severe enough, host death (Wodarz [2007] ). Wodarz [2007] refers to this latter type of response as CTL-induced pathology. In addition, the immunological response and infection length are influenced by current infections and infection history (Telfer et al. [2008] ). Pedersen and Fenton [2007] emphasize the importance of understanding the community ecology at the level of the within-host, that is, a tri-trophic level interaction among the immune system, pathogen community and their respective target cells. The differences in the immune response to a viral pathogen by a reservoir as opposed to a spill over species needs further investigation. These differences in responses are key to understanding hostswitching and cross-species pathogen transmission (Childs et al. [2007] , Hochberg and Holt [1990] , Parrish et al. [2008] , Davies [2009], Pulliam [2008] , Sch\u00f6nrich et al. [2008] ). Mathematical models with multiple pathogens are just beginning to explore the role of the within-host immune response on the population dynamics (Fenton [2008] , Fenton et al. [2008] , Hawley and Altizer [2011] , Pugliese and Gandolfi [2008] ).",

[2005] , Lauring and Andino [2010] , Nowak and May [2000] ). Eigen [1971] introduced the concept of quasispecies in 1971 to describe the origin of life and more recently, this concept has been applied to RNA viruses (Holmes [2010] , Lauring and Andino [2010] , M\u00e1s et al. [2010] ). Regardless if one uses the concept of quasispecies to describe intra-host variation of RNA viruses or population theories, it is well supported that RNA viruses have a high mutation rate and lack error-correcting mechanisms. This lack of error correction results in a greater diversity and distribution of the viral genetics that may be selected upon within the host following a successful infection. Insight into the mechanism in which viruses adapt to new hosts is critical since many new viral zoonoses are RNA viruses, such as hantaviruses, avian influenza viruses, Nipah virus and SARS CoV. Hence, modeling of this phenotype of RNA viruses can shed light on how to predict which viruses in wildlife have intrinsic genetic character that would permit spill over into other species and amplification. A simple mathematical model for viral quasispecies assumes the possibility of n viral strains (Bull et al. [2005] , Nowak and May [2000] ). Mutation occurs during replication within an infected cell and leads to production of a mutant type. Assuming the master viral sequence is type 1, then the probability of a mutation from genotype 1 to j is q j 1 . In general, q ij is the mutation from genotype j to i , j = i and q ii is the probability that genotype i does not mutate. A simple model for viral quasispecies has the following form (Nowak and May [2000] ):",

Models that can evaluate the genomic trajectory of particular RNA viruses in reservoir host species are essential to understanding how viral zoonoses are maintained in nature. Additionally, models that incorporate selective pressures (e.g., resources such as food and water, predators, breeding cycles), infection history and the heterogeneity in an animal's ability to maintain and amplify a pathogen can be used to probe how viruses are maintained in their reservoirs and to determine what drives spill over into new nonreservoir species. There is a need for increased surveillance of wildlife diseases and inclusion of this data in model formulation and analysis. Difficulties encountered due to case acquisition and underreporting, and lack of existing wildlife surveillance infrastructure and validated diagnostic tests need to be overcome (Stallknecht [2007] ). Modeling is crucial given that the successful spill over event is rare, and can help drive hypothesis testing that can capture such events in controlled experimental or field settings. With respect to immunological pressures, many unanswered questions need to be addressed with models. For example, what are the mechanisms of the immune response in the wildlife host that lead to a persistent infection or to the possibility of a superspreader? How and why does it differ in the spill over dead-end host that either dies or has no productive infection? How does the immune response differ when a host is infected with a single versus multiple pathogens? What effects do seasonality or climate change have on the immune response and disease susceptibility? What are the drivers of host-switching events that lead to emergence of new disease? Formulation and analysis of more detailed within-host models to existing population level model structures will be necessary to accurately evaluate and predict risk of infection and development of disease in animal populations.",
