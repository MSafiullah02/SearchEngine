As such, epidemiologists, ecologists, geographers, and others are grappling with the implications of global climate projections for infectious diseases using a variety of approaches.

Biological models estimate the responsiveness and thresholds of parasites, pathogens, and vectors to temperature and precipitation. These models can be used to estimate survivorship, transmissibility, and reproduction, including estimates of R0\u2014the basic reproductive ratio\u2014under different climate scenarios (see Lafferty, 2009 for review). Based largely on studies of vector and/or parasite development, warming and increases in humidity are predicted to open up new zones for malaria in Africa (Epstein et al., 1998; Martens, 1999), parasitic nematodes in the Arctic (Kutz et al., 2005), West Nile Virus (Reisen et al., 2006), Lyme disease in North America (Ogden et al., 2008), and Schistosomiasis in China (Zhou et al., 2008). Historical analyses of climate patterns coupled with these biological process models provide additional explanatory power. For example, observed altitudinal increases in falciparum malaria in the East African highlands during the past 30 years have been associated with increasing temperatures and are consistent with models of anopheline mosquito vector development (Pascual et al., 2006).",

That is because future temperatures may exceed the biological thresholds for survival or transmission at these boundaries. More analysis of biological maxima and minima of pathogens, parasites, and their vectors, including their diurnal fluctuation thresholds, in concert with downscaled climate models or historical records will be helpful in this regard. Paaijmans et al. (2009) analyzed development time of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in relation to that of its vector under a range of diurnal temperature fluctuations. They found that at the higher mean temperatures (>26\u00b0C) associated with endemic malaria transmission in Africa effects of global warming on malaria dynamics may be overestimated. However, at lower mean temperatures associated with epidemic outbreaks (<20\u00b0C), such as those found in the Kenyan Highlands, real increases in R0 with a couple degrees of warming are biologically possible, and consistent with epidemiological trends during the past 20 years in that region.",

More recent statistical mapping (also called niche modeling) approaches have been able to use downscaled climate models (de la Rocque, 2008) in their projections. Several have predicted northward shifting zones of infection with modest impacts on overall extent of distribution (Rogers and Randolph, 2000; Hay et al., 2004; Nakazawa et al., 2007).

The principal ecological determinant for successful establishment for zoonotic and vector-borne disease success in a decadal time frame is probably a broad host range (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005; Daszak et al., 2000). In recent years, a number of vector-borne viral diseases have migrated across or between continents through their ability to acquire new vectors (West Nile, Chikungunya) or utilize diverse and widely dispersed domestic (Rift Valley) or native (West Nile) animal hosts (Gould and Higgs, 2009). Importantly, the capacity to acquire new vector and host species often is facilitated by the capacity of the pathogen to evolve mutant strains that are efficiently acquired and transmitted by this new species.",

Egg survival is dependent on ground moisture levels, but intermediate stages survive in rodents, and its definitive hosts are typically foxes, coyotes, and dogs. At large spatial scales across China and inner Mongolia, A. echinococcus distribution has become focal due to the interaction of the requirements for a physical environment that is moist and cool enough to allow for egg survival and for the grassland landscapes that support both high densities of small mammals and canine hosts (Giraudoux et al., 2006). High levels of forest cover or cleared agricultural landscapes reduce intermediate and/or definitive host densities.",

Further support can be seen in the rapid reemergence of tick-borne encephalitis in central and eastern European states after the collapse of the Soviet Union (1970\u20132005) (Sumilo et al., 2008). Statistical comparisons of results of extensive socioeconomic surveys and public health data across five former Soviet states indicate that various socioeconomic, land use, and public health programs can explain most of the variation across countries in the spread of tick-borne encephalitis during this period. In this analysis, climate variables were not assessed, but significant unemployment, reversion of agricultural lands, reduced pesticide use, reduced chemotherapy, and individual exposure through increased field collection of wild foods appear to have contributed to rapid increases during the early 1990s.",

In an analysis of frequency all cause diarrhea in children younger than age 5 years in low- and middle-income countries, Lloyd et al. (2007) found that low mean monthly rainfall during the course of a year was significantly associated with disease. Surprisingly, neither temperature nor simple measures of socioeconomic development (GDP or GCP) were significant in this analysis of a disease type mostly managed by traditional public health measures, such as sanitation and education. Diarrheal diseases are produced by a diversity of bacterial, viral, and protozoan organisms. Strain diversity within a species is high locally (e.g., Jiang et al., 2000) around the world, and migration to new zones has significant implications for biologically na\u00efve host populations.",

Using a series of regression models and variation partitioning analyses to separate pure and combined effects of income and climate their findings support the hypotheses that: 1) income can moderate the adverse effect of climate on life expectancy (LE); 2) as income grows climate will have less of an effect on LE; and 3) climate has a larger effect on LE in African countries than in non-African countries, and further that for African countries, climate has had a larger effect on LE than wealth.",
