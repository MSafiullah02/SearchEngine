            "text": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) named by the World Health Organization (WHO) is the causative agent for latest ongoing respiratory infection outbreak, which started in late 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China (Huang et al., 2020). Its first case was reported in late November, 2019. Coronavirus belongs to Coronaviridae family and is an enveloped, non-segmented virus, which possess positive sense RNA as a genomic material. This particular outbreak is thought to be correlated with a crowded seafood market in Wuhan, China, which has been closed since 23 January 2020. Several investigation teams are working for the identification of origin of the spread. By April 28, 2020, there are 2,954,222 (\u223c 3 million) confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally out of them 84,341 were from China, mainland and \u223c4,643 deaths have been attributed, reported by WHO. Outside China mainland, there are reports that 213 other countries/territories around the globe are affected with highest cases recorded in European region which has crossed 1.3 million (1,359,380) confirmed cases and 124,525 claimed lives followed by Regions of Americas which has 11,405,20 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 58,492 claimed lives (WHO Situation Report 98). There are several host where Coronavirus infections have been reported such as avian hosts (Zhu et al., 2020), mammals like dogs, cats, camels, mice masked palm civets and bats. Reports has been shown the identification of novel mammalian coronaviruses now almost on regular basis. For instance, Coronavirus named HKU2 was originated from bat in 2018 and infected the pigs, which further showed the fatal diarrhoea syndrome (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200305-sitrep-45-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=ed2ba78b_2). Spread of already known human coronaviruses is not so threatening i.e. they have shown only mild clinical symptoms (Cavanagh, 2007). While two evident exclusions are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in 21st Century means in last two decades. SARS-CoV belongs to genera Betacoronaviruses that originated from Guangdong Province in Southern part of China in year 2002 (Ismail et al., 2003), which unfortunately claimed 774 human lives and >8,000 infections in human from 37 countries around the globe in 2002 to 2003 (Zhou et al., 2018). Another outbreak, MERS-CoV was started from Saudi Arab in 2012 (Zhou et al., 2018) and 2494 infection cases of MERS-CoV were reported as laboratory confirmed cases with 858 fatal cases from 2012 to date which includes claim of 38 lives (Su et al., 2016). Past two outbreaks and a recent ongoing outbreak may only be a fraction of what yet to come or can be seen and understood i.e. more severe and possibly new zoonotic infections of coronaviruses incidences yet to be discovered which shows a worldwide warning to public health (Peiris et al., 2004).",

The best way to overcome with the present situation and also preparedness for the upcoming outbreaks is the development of the vaccine against this deadly COVID-19. Particularly, in the absence of any effective drug treatment against these deadly viruses, vaccines are considered to be an obligate requirement. The continuous spread of this devastating viral infection with high mortality rate demands a protected and efficient vaccine. In modern times, multi-epitope subunit vaccine (MESV) formulation is newest way to fight against deadly pathogens. Epitopes (Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL), Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) and B-cell Lymphocytes (BCL) i.e. short stretches of amino acid sequences of protein can elicits direct and strong immune response, then response generated by whole protein itself (Kao et al., 2009). Nevertheless, for the development of the MESV, amino acid sequence of the immunogenic proteins of interest should be known. Scientist working in Chinese Center for Disease control and Prevention & National Institute for Viral Disease and Prevention in Beijing, China and their associate collaborators emancipated whole genome sequence of COVID-19 and shared on all public databases, demonstrating fast sequencing of genome in the response of devastating outbreak which is helping in better diagnosing and treatment of further incidences. Upon initial analyses, sequencing data revealed the homology at protein sequence level with SARS-CoV and might latches onto human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Chan-Yeung and Yu, 2003).",

            "text": "Hypothetically, almost all proteins of the miniature organism (viruses) are potential vaccine targets (Shi et al., 2015). In an incredibly fast piece of study, it has been shown that once this virus installed itself into the human body, it encodes its \u201ctool proteins\u201d which helps in the replication. These \u201ctool proteins\u201d i.e. non-structural proteins are the key (toolkit) to synthesize the other structural proteins (Spike, Membrane, Envelope and Nucleocapsid) and factors which requires to grow its progeny (Lewis et al., 2020). In our strategy of vaccine development, we have engineered the toolkit i.e. non-structural proteins which includes 3-C like proteinase (YP_009725301.1), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (YP_009725307.1), Helicase (YP_009725308.1), 3\u2019-5\u2019 exonuclease (YP_009725309.1), 2\u2019-O-ribo methyl transferase (YP_009725311.1) & endoRNase (YP_009725310.1). All these proteins have also used as a drug target for commercially available antiviral drugs to fight against sudden outbreak of COVID-19, since there are no specific antivirals available (Beck et al., 2020). Further, several non-structural proteins make the replicase-transcriptase complex, which ultimately helps in the replication and transcription of virus genomic RNA (Ziebuhr, 2005). The 3-C like proteinase is a protease present in all coronaviruses, which helps in proteolysis of the non-structural protein 5 (nsp5) during replication process of virus (Tomar et al., 2015). This makes it a high value vaccine candidate against the coronavirus. Further, a key enzyme of coronavirus replication and transcription system is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is encoded by nsp12, also appears as an attractive target for therapeutics (Gao et al., 2020). This enzyme catalyses the viral RNA synthesis and therefore plays an important role in the replication/transcription process during COVID-19 infection. Helicase of coronavirus encodes by nsp13 helps in the parting of dsDNA and RNA in a 5\u2019 \u2013 3\u2019 direction (Adedeji and Lazarus, 2016). Endoribonuclease is an enzyme encoded by nsp15, which cleaves specially at uridine residues and another replicative enzyme that is exoribonuclease encoded by nsp14 possess the N7-methyltransferase activity and also involved in checking fidelity of the replication whereas nsp16 encodes for 2\u2019-O-ribo methyl transferases. Remarkably, nsp14 and nsp15, both ribonucleases are distinct to Nidovirales order which are envisaged genetic markers for the viruses belongs to this order (Bhardwaj et al., 2004; Snijder et al., 2003). However, a recent insilico study has anticipated that several non-structural proteins work as adhesins, which plays role in the adhesion and invasion into the host cell (Ong et al., 2020). Hence, these tool proteins, which makes the replication/transcription machinery complex, and also function as adhesins could be good candidate for vaccine development. To develop a strong and potential vaccine, we have used an immunoinformatic approach and also shown its binding with the human immune receptor TLR-3 by molecular interaction studies. The strategy we have used helped in identifying the antigenic epitopes for all proteins used in the study and vaccine construct was analysed for several other parameters like antigenicity, allergenicity, physicochemical properties which is suited as a candidate vaccine. The strategy used in the study has shown in the figure 1\n.",

After this the next step was of solvation, with the help of commands the protein get centred in a box of 1.0 nm, which was then filled with the solvent (can be water or any other solvent). Further, the ions (Na or Cl ions) were added in the solvation box, having the charged protein, in order to exchange the HOH molecules with it. Then, prior to MD run, energy minimization of the protein was done to achieve the lowest energy of the protein. Subsequently, the equilibration of the solvent was done in association with pressure (NPT) and temperature (NVT).

Thus, we had chosen the one-month interval and identified the dose dependent immunological response of our vaccine candidate. Besides, the likeliness of the immune response generated by the vaccine (in response to pathogen invasion) was analyzed through repeated exposure of X following injection doses. In each instance, one dose was made up of X vaccine molecules where the simulation was conducted for almost X days.

They are also use to discrete the domains, in a single protein sequence without distressing the function of protein and helps to maintain a stable and flexible protein complex. Here, in this study we have used different types of linkers to connect the epitopes for instance, for linking B-cell epitopes \u201cKK\u201d (Yano et al., 2005) (augmentation of proteasome processing) linkers were used while for linking CTL and HTL epitopes \u201cAAY\u201d (Ojha et al., 2019b) (proteasomal cleavage site and avoid the genesis of new epitope) and \u201cGPGPG (Livingston et al., 2002) (for improving the flexibility of protein)\u201d linkers were availed, respectively. Along with these linkers one more linker was used i.e. EAAAK, which has been reported as a helix forming linker in the designing of next-generation vaccine. Next, to acquire more immunogenic construct, at the N-terminal of the designed vaccine an adjuvant namely, human beta defensin 3 (45 amino acids) was attached. This TLR-3 agonist human beta defensin 3 has been well known to augment the strong T-cell and B-cell immunity (Gupta et al., 2020; Mohan et al., 2013).",

Among these 6 approaches, SVM modules based on both amino acid and dipeptide composition and Hybrid approach identified the vaccine construct as allergenic whereas MEME/Mast motif, BLAST search on ARPs, IgE mapping approaches identified the construct as non-allergenic. So, further to cross check this mystery we again checked the allergenicity with AllerTop server, the result from this server exposed the designed vaccine construct as probable non-allergen. Hence, by taking both the results from different servers into consideration, we concluded that designed vaccine candidate was probably non-allergen and will not lead to any allergy during pre and post vaccination. Subsequently, with the help of ToxinPred server we have checked the toxicity of the epitopes, as this server accepts the protein sequences of >500 amino acids and here, in this study the designed vaccine candidate was of 561 amino acid. So, after doing this it was found that all the epitopes involved in the designing of vaccine candidate was non-toxic and will not release any toxic components after administration (Supplementary table 5A, 5B and 5C).

During the SARS outbreak in 2015 Tortura et al. has reported that mice lacking TLR3 and TLR4 are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV in comparison to mice having TLR3 and TLR4 receptors; exceptionally weight loss was observed when exposed to infection, but no mortality was detected (Totura et al., 2015). One more rational for the selection of TLR3 was that it mainly recognizes the viruses which have RNA as genetic material. Subsequently, after the selection of TLR3 receptor we have proceeded for the docking and the process was done with the help of HADDOCK server in order to illustrate the functioning of ligand molecules which binds to the active site of the receptor as well as to explicate the essential biochemical activities. Before initializing docking, the active and passive residues (interactive residues) for both the vaccine candidate as well TLR3 receptor has been predicted with the help of CPROT server, a part of HADDOCK. After performing molecular docking, we have obtained 8 clusters of the docked complexes and each cluster was composed of 4 best docked complexes. According to HAADOCK server calculation the attained top 10 clusters were highly reliable. Further, the docked complex was finalized on the basis of Z score and RMSD value (Table 2\n).

Various steps like energy minimization, pressure assessment, temperature, and potential energy calculations were analyzed after the MD simulation study. The temperature calculation plot reveal that the system remains persistent at 300 K (Fig. 7\nA) at around 100 ps time interval, whereas in case of pressure the system demonstrates pressure fluctuation with an average value of 1 bar at the same time interval (Fig. 7B). The complex root mean square deviation (RMSD) plot demonstrated the structural stability and flexibility of the docked complex. RMSD vs. time plot reveals that the primary fluctuation started with 0.15 nm and completed at 0.55 nm after 6 ns of a time span and the minor fluctuations were also observed in the docked complex, after this the complex reached to its stable position at 6 ns (Fig. 7C). Next, the root medium square fluctuation (RMSF) was obtained for amino acid side chains in order to analyse the fluctuations of amino acid in the docked complex. The RMSF plot reveals minor shifts in amino acid side chains, indicating the continuing interaction of the vaccine candidate and the TLR-3 receptor. In the RMSF plot the very fluctuated regions indicates the extremely flexible complex and here, the higher peaks (100-200 residues and 600-700 residue) in the RMSF plot indicate approximately 0.4 nm suggests that the complex comprises extremely stable extents (Fig. 7D).",

In our results, we have observed the proliferation in secondary and tertian immune response which is identified by IgG1 + IgG2 and IgM. Also, while decreasing the antigen count IgG + IgM also showed the proliferated response in Figure 8\nA. Result revealed the immune response development upon immunization. B-cell population level was also stimulated and seems to be very high upon immunization (Figure 8 B). Likewise, in secondary and tertian immune response, cell mediated immunity i.e. the cytotoxic and helper T cells (Tc & Th) levels were high (Figure 8 C & D). Level of IFN- \u03b3 was retained during the exposure time which has been shown in Figure 8 E. These results are significant for the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the designed vaccine candidate can compete to control the devastating coronavirus outbreak.",

Featuring the effect of this debilitating outbreak is not feasible because of its rapid spread. The recent three outbreaks of coronaviruses in past two decades are different from their \u201ccommon cold\u201d causing friends and can spark a fire in individual's body. The newly dubbed enemy, in the form of virus was initially named as COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO) and now formally named as SARS-CoV-2. The virus primarily attacks on respiratory system, which involves three major steps: replication of the virus, hyper-reactivity of the immune system and pulmonary obstruction. As per the WHO, the virus makes the perforated holes in the lungs, which upon infection give them honey-comb appearance. To inhibit the viral infections in human the vaccination is one of the most desirable way. Herein, we have devised a multi-epitope subunit vaccine to elicit the immune response against COVID-19 which comprises of an adjuvant i.e. beta-defensin 3 at N terminal end followed by B-cell epitopes, HTL epitopes and CTL epitopes connected with appropriate linker sequences. The physicochemical parameters of vaccine candidate which includes allergenicity, solubility, pI, hydrophobicity, molecular weight, GRAVY, half-life indicated its effectiveness. The binding specificity of the vaccine candidate with human immune cell receptor i.e. TLR3 was assessed by molecular docking interaction. Lowest energy score obtained showed the strong interaction and specificity between vaccine and binding groove of TLR3 receptor. Our devised vaccine candidate showed the stable and prolonged binding in molecular dynamics simulation with negligible deviation in RMSF and RMSD values. Additionally, immune simulation that mimics the natural environment in computational immunology experiment exhibited the strong immunological response data from the major players of the immunity i.e. cell mediated (T-cell) and humoral (B-cell) at different doses at different intervals for COVID-19 multi-epitope subunit vaccine. This work provides an innovative vaccine construct against the recent COVID-19 outbreak and encourages the development of the vaccine against other newly emerging infectious disease.",
