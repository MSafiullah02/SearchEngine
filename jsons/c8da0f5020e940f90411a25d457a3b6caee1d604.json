This loss of potency has raised serious questions with regard to effective longterm antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS. In this context, our research has focused on designing inhibitors that form extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions with the enzymes backbone in the active site.

Subsequent drug-development efforts led to the advent of the first generation of protease inhibitors (PIs) marking a new era in AIDS chemotherapy.

With many enzymes, multiple protein chains combine through noncovalent interactions forming a quaternary structure possessing multiple subunits. Protein structures are stabilized by a collection of weak intramolecular forces that can be disrupted and reformed allowing a limited range of dynamic movement. The folding process creates cavities near the surface of the enzyme that may serve as substrate binding sites. Interestingly, a relatively small volume of the overall enzyme constitutes the active catalytic site with the remainder of the protein serving as a structural scaffold.

The active site is formed by two catalytic aspartic acids and each residue is located in each domain (monomer). The scissile bond of the peptide substrate is in close proximity to the active site. A pair of flaps, one from each monomer, is located at the entrance to the active site. [61] The flaps fold down over substrates upon binding and act as a solvent shield that excludes water and creates a local environment conducive to catalysis. The flaps are flexible, showing an open conformation in the apoenzyme.

These structural comparisons provided insight into the molecular design strategy for combating drug resistance as reviewed recently. [50] Mutations can be divided into two main categories. First, mutations of active-site residues can directly alter protease interactions with an inhibitor, as shown by examples of mutants containing I84V or I50V that reduce interactions with a number of PIs. [69] [70] [71] Alternatively, distal mutations can act indirectly to diminish protease stability and interactions with an inhibitor, as shown for mutants with L24I, F53L, and L90M. [70, 72, 73] The majority of these mutants show minimal changes in the backbone structure around the active site. Even the flexible flaps generally show changes of less than 1 for the backbone atoms. One exception is mutation V82A, which produces shifts in the loop comprising residues 79-82 with compensating hydrophobic contacts. [71, 73, 74] The loop can adjust by 1-2 to accommodate the different-sized hydrophobic groups at P1 and P1' of the inhibitors. [75] As depicted in Figure 2 , even structures of drug-resistant HIV-1 proteases with 10-14 mutations, and HIV-2 protease which differs in about 40 different residues, superimpose with only a minimal deviation in the backbone atoms around the active site. [51, [76] [77] [78] [79] Mutations producing drug resistance cannot significantly alter the overall structure of the active site that is essential for protease function. Viable mutant strains will show minimal distortions in the structure of the protease active site as expected in order to maintain catalytic activity and viral replication fitness. [50, 52] Based on these observations, we hypothesized that inhibitors that maximize hydrogenbonding interactions with backbone NH or C = O atoms in the active site would retain these interactions in viral mutants. Therefore, these compounds would maintain potency despite viral mutation, providing a viable solution to the problem of drug resistance in HIV-1 treatments. Using this original design concept, we have actively designed and synthesized a variety of inhibitors that form extensive binding interactions with the protease backbone and are capable of maintaining efficacy against panels of clinically relevant drug-resistant HIV-1 viral strains.

One of these PIs was darunavir (2, TMC-114, UIC-94017), which has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients harboring drug-resistant HIV. [81, 82] We have described the development of darunavir in a number of recent reviews.

[90] The cyclopentyl derivative 6 ( Figure 5 ) was significantly less active even though this PI presumably fills the substrate binding site in the same fashion as inhibitor 5. This result indicated that the cyclic ether oxygen is very important. A preliminary X-ray structure of 4-bound HIV-1 protease showed that the THF-ring oxygen is involved in a weak hydrogen-bonding interaction with the NH groups of Asp29 and Asp30. [90] Introduction of this 3S-THF urethane in the hydroxyethylamine sulfonamide isostere developed by Vasquez et al. [91] and Tung et al. [92] resulted in PI 7 ( Figure 5 , VX-478). [93] This was subsequently developed into the FDA-approved inhibitor amprenavir/fosamprenavir. The X-ray structure of 7-bound HIV-1 protease indicated that the ring fills the S2 subsite and the ring oxygen is involved in a weak interaction with the Asp29 and Asp30 backbone amides (distances of 3.4 and 3.5 , respectively). [93] Based upon our preliminary development of 3S-THF urethane as a possible substitute for both the P2 and the P3 ligands of saquinavir, we became interested in further enhancing the binding-site interactions in the S2 subsite.

Inhibitor 8 was also considerably more potent than inhibitor 4 with 3S-THF as the P2 ligand. Our X-ray crystallographic studies revealed that the bis-THF oxygens form effective hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH groups of Asp29 and Asp30.

As shown in Figure 7 , inhibitor 10 (UIC-PI or UIC94003 and later TMC-126) exhibited marked enzyme inhibitory potency (K i = 14 pm) and antiviral activity (ID 50 = 1.4 nm) in CEM cell lines.

[95] As shown in Figure 8 , both oxygen atoms of the P2 bis-THF ligand form strong hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH groups of Asp29 and Asp30 in the S2 subsite. In the S2' subsite, the p-methoxy oxygen also forms strong hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH group of Asp30' as well as with carboxylate of the the Asp30' side chain.

As shown in Table 1 , this inhibitor maintained very impressive potency (K i < 100 pm) and the K i mut /K i wt ratios were no greater than 5. This indicated that proteases with multiple mutations, which were shown to be highly resistant to approved first-generation PIs, displayed a low level of resistance against 10.

[105] Darunavirs potent antiviral activity combined with its relatively low cytotoxicity provides it with an elevated selectivity index (> 20 000 CC 50 /EC 50 ). [105] More importantly, darunavir has consistently retained its impressive antiviral activity against a host of viral strains with resistance-related mutations. Notably, darunavir exerted very impressive activity against highly multi-PI-resistant clinical HIV-1 variants isolated from patients with AIDS who did not respond to existing antiviral regimens (results are shown in Table 4 ). Darunavir (2) exhibited excellent antiviral activity with IC 50 values ranging from 3 to 30 nm while APV, IDV, NFV, and RTV, were virtually ineffective in blocking the replication of all multi-PIresistant strains.

However, brecanavirs clinical trials were terminated because of formulation issues. [119] We have investigated structure-based modifications of the P1 side chain of inhibitor 11. Of particular interest, we attempted to incorporate a basic amine or a cyclic ether functionality to improve aqueous solubility and other pharmacological properties. Both PIs 13 and 14 have shown very potent antiviral activity. [120] Inhibitor 15 (GS-8374) containing a P2 bis-THF unit, a P2' p-methoxybenzesulfonamide ligand, and a diethylphosphonylmethoxy group attached to the P1 phenyl ligand was developed by researchers at Gilead Sciences. [121] The phosphonate functionality was designed to promote better intracellular retention without interfering with the protease binding site of 10 (TMC-126). This PI (15) displayed an excellent resistance profile. [121, 122] It exhibited a mean 6.2-fold change in EC 50 values (range 0.6-26 nm) from the wild-type HIV. Inhibitor 15 displayed a mean 29.8-fold change (1.0-157 nm) and 23.6-fold change of EC 50 values (1.2-121 nm) compared to darunavir and BCV, respectively. Towards a possible explanation of this marked resistance suppression, it was proposed that the phosphonate moiety acted as an anchor point in the solvent medium and enhanced the degeneracy of the binding state of the inhibitor by providing favorable entropic com-pensation following protease mutations. Interestingly, selection of HIV-1 strains exposed to 15 did not exhibit any signs of RAM (resistance-associated mutation) even after six months. [123] GS-8374 has been reported to show more favorable pharmacological and metabolic profiles than other PIs. In the X-ray crystal structure of 15-bound HIV-1 protease the binding profiles for the P2 bis-THF and the P2' methoxysulfonamide ligands are similar to those observed in the X-ray structure of the 10-bound HIV-1 protease. A comparison of the two structures showed that one of the phosphonate ethyl moieties of 15 is bound in a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of protease.

Based upon the X-ray structure of 10-bound HIV-1 protease, we envisioned that heteroatom-containing substituents at the C4 position of the bis-THF ligand would be ideally positioned to interact with the backbone NH group of Gly48. [95] Therefore, we synthesized a series of new PIs incorporating C4-alkoxysubstituted bis-THF ligands. [125] As shown in Figure 13 , inhibitor 16 with a 4R-methoxy group has better enzyme inhibitory potency (K i = 2.9 pm) than inhibitor 10 (K i = 14 pm). The 4R isomer 16 was 12-fold more potent than the corresponding 4S isomer 17. Larger alkyl groups at C4, such as benzyloxy substituents, led to significant reduction in potency. An X-ray structure of 16-bound HIV-1 protease ( Figure 13 ) showed extensive interactions of the inhibitor with the protease active site similar to those of inhibitor 10. [125] However, it appears that the oxygen of the 4R-methoxy group forms a unique water-mediated hydrogen bond with the NH group of Gly48. The improvement in binding affinity of 16 may be due to this water-mediated hydrogen bond with the backbone NH group of Gly48.

[95] The design perception for these macrocycles evolved from the observation that certain mutations lead to decreased van der Waals interactions and an increase in size of the hydrophobic pocket in the S1' subsite. The structural studies of A-77003 [126] indicated that the V82A mutant results in decreased van der Waals interactions with the phenyl rings in both the S1 and S1' subsites. [127] Also, there was evidence of the repacking of the inhibitor side chain and protease atoms in the S1 subsite. Based upon this insight, we envisioned that 11-to 15membered saturated and unsaturated macrocycles would effectively fill the S1'-S2' subsites. As shown in Figure 14 , macrocyclic inhibitors 20 and 21 displayed excellent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral activity; however, their acyclic homologues were significantly less potent. Also, saturated inhibitors were less active than their unsaturated analogues. [95] To ascertain if the structural effects led to improved drugresistance properties, inhibitors 20 and 21 were evaluated against a panel of clinical wild-type X 4 -HIV-1 isolates (HIV-1 ERS104pre ) along with various multidrug-resistant clinical X 4and R 5 -HIV-1 isolates using PBMCs as target cells. [95, 105] As shown in Table 8 , the potency of both inhibitors against HIV-1 ERS104pre (IC 50 = 7 and 5 nm, respectively) was superior to that of the approved inhibitors IDV, APV, and LPV but nearly twofold less potent than darunavir (IC 50 = 3 nm). [95] Inhibitor 20 showed better potency than amprenavir against HIV-1M DR/C , HIV-1M DR/G , HIV-1M DR/TM , and HIV-1M DR/JSL and was six times more potent against HIV-1M DR/MM . Inhibitor 21 also displayed superior potency against HIV-1M DR/C and HIV-1M DR/G (greater than 12-and 15-fold, respectively) compared to amprenavir.

This effort led to the design of a stereochemically defined bicyclic hexahydrocyclopentanofuran (Cp-THF) as the P2 ligand. Incorporation of this ligand in the hydroxyethylaminosulfonamide isostere provided a series of exceptionally potent PIs. [51] We positioned the cyclic ether oxygen in the Cp-THF ring to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH groups of Asp29 and Asp30. As can be seen in Figure 16 , replacing the bis-THF in darunavir with a new Cp-THF ligand provided inhibitor 22, which exhibited subnanomolar enzyme inhibitory potency nearly ten times less than that of darunavir (K i = 16 pm). We believed that binding of the Cp-THF ligand in the S2 subsite was distinct from the bis-THF ligand and may have caused a slight shift in position of the remainder of the inhibitor structure within the active site.

Essentially, we would insert an oxygen atom into the Cp-THF ring and form a meso-hexahydrocyclopenta-1,3-dioxolane ligand which would greatly reduce the stereochemical complexity and allow for a simplified synthetic pathway. In addition to the synthetic advantage, we postulated that the additional ether oxygen may engage in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protease thereby enhancing the potency of the PIs.

As can be seen, inhibitor 30 with a 3R-hydroxy group showed the most potent antiviral activity comparable to that of (1) [a] Amino acid substitutions identified in the protease-encoding region compared to the consensus type B sequence cited from the Los Alamos database, see reference [129] for details. darunavir. The related inhibitor 29 with a 3S-hydroxy group was also quite potent. We prepared the corresponding 3methoxy-Cp-THF ligands and the resulting inhibitors 31 and 32 showed stereochemical preferences and potencies similar to those of the corresponding hydroxy derivatives. [130] We then determined the X-ray crystal structure of 30bound HIV-1 protease at 1.23 resolution. As shown in Figure 21 , the Cp-THF ring oxygen forms a strong hydrogen bond with the Asp29 NH group and a rather weak hydrogen bond with the Asp29 carboxylate.

We particularly planned to design PIs with new P1' ligands in place of the isobutyl group of 23 that could interact with backbone atoms as well as fill the hydrophobic pocket in S1' subsite. We explored the incorporation of stereochemically defined 2-pyrrolidinone and oxazolidinone functionalities so that the pyrrolidinone NH group could form a hydrogen bond with Gly27' and its carbonyl group could interact with Arg8' in the S1' site. [131] Our initial plan was to examine the potential of the new P1' ligand in combination with Cp-THF and bis-THF ligands. We also wanted to address the question of whether enhancement of backbone-binding interactions would lead to PIs with improved drug-resistance profiles. The results of this investigation are summarized in Figure 22 . Inhibitor 33 with (S)-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone as the P1' ligand showed good enzyme inhibitory potency but its antiviral IC 50 value was 230 nm. The (R)-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone derivative 34 showed improvement in both the K i value and antiviral activity (IC 50 = 26 nm) relative to S-pyrrolidine derivative 33. For the combination of bis-THF as P2 and (R)-methyl-2oxazolidinone as P1' ligands, however, the antiviral activity was significantly less than that of 10. The antiviral potency of 34 was nearly ten times less than that of 23. This is possibly a result of the poor cellular permeability of the polar 2oxazolidinone functionality. Nevertheless, inhibitor 34 is a very potent inhibitor with antiviral activity comparable to that of FDA-approved PIs such as IDV, APV and LPV.

[131] As shown in Figure 23 the interactions between the inhibitor and the active site are quite extensive. Most strikingly, the P1'-pyrrolidinone exists in two conformations. In one conformation, the pyrrolidinone NH group is engaged in a hydrogen bond with the Gly27' carbonyl and the pyrrolidinone carbonyl forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the Arg8' side chain. In another conformation, the pyrrolidinone ligand fills the hydrophobic pocket and the carbonyl group makes a weak hydrogen bond with the Val82' backbone NH group. Other binding interactions of the Cp-THF ligand in the S2 site are similar to those of 23 and the methoxy oxygen in S2' forms a strong hydrogen bond with the backbone NH group of Asp30' and the side-chain carboxylate group. [131] Inhibitor 34 was evaluated against a wide spectrum of laboratory and clinical wild-type and multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strains. Table 13 shows its anti-HIV activity against selected clinical isolates highly resistant to multiple PIs. [131, 132] As can be seen, inhibitor 34 was highly potent against various clinical isolates tested. Except darunavir, all other approved PIs failed to exert comparable activity. However, inhibitor 34, like darunavir, potently inhibited all seven primary strains. Particularly, 34 maintained nearly full potency except with the R5 phenotype where it lost potency slightly (by less than twofold). Overall, the interactions of inhibitor 34 (GRL-02031) with backbone atoms particularly in the S1' subsite were enhanced compared to those with inhibitor 23. These polar interactions and the conformational flexibility of the P1' oxazolidinone most likely contributed to its robust activity against multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants. [132] 7. Following exploration of our PIs based on meso P2 ligands, we continued to examine ways in which we could reduce the stereochemical complexity of the bis-THF ligand while maintaining key backbone interactions and accommodating variations in the amino acid side chains within the active site occurring after viral mutations. To probe this, we turned to cyclic-polyether-derived P2 ligand systems possessing flexible rings capable of repacking within the binding pocket in response to mutational changes. [133] Based on this proposition, we removed the shared C \u00c0 C bond from bis-THF producing the flexible eight-membered-ring inhibitor 36 shown in Figure 24 . Unfortunately, 36 displayed significantly (1) [a] Amino acid substitutions identified in the protease-encoding regions of HIV-1 ERS104pre , HIV-1 TM , HIV-1 MM , HIV-1 C , and HIV-1 G compared to the consensus B sequence cited from the Los Alamos database, see references [131] and [132] . lower enzyme inhibitory potency than darunavir. Reducing the ring size to a seven-membered ring restored enzyme inhibitory activity, and a preference for the R stereoisomer was revealed as the corresponding PI with epimeric P2 ligand displayed significant loss in potency (K i = 0.16 nm, IC 50 = 30 nm). Further reductions in ring size led to the sixmembered-ring inhibitor 38 which was also highly potent. In general, expanding the ring to larger polycyclic ethers (tenmembered rings and larger) resulted in a drastic loss in potency. The ether oxygens within these ring systems are critical for maintaining high levels of enzyme inhibition activity. The removal of either oxygen from 37 resulted in a significant loss in activity. An X-ray crystal structure of 37-bound HIV-1 protease was determined at 1.00 resolution. The majority of binding interactions within the active site are similar in nature to those with inhibitor 10 (TMC-126) except for interactions in the S2 site. As shown in Figure 25 , one of the oxygens of the 1,3dioxepane ligand is involved in hydrogen bonding with Asp29 and Asp30 NH groups. The other oxygen is involved in a unique interaction with the Gly48 NH group through a water molecule. [133] Both PIs 37 and 38 were further evaluated for their antiviral activity against a panel of clinically relevant HIV-1 isolates (Table 14) . While they were less potent than darunavir, both compounds outperformed the approved PIs RTV and IDV and were comparable in antiviral activity to APV. These results suggested that the ability of the P2 ligand in 37 to maintain hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein backbone may be responsible for the improved drug-resistance profiles of 37 over other PIs examined. The design of PIs using the concept of maximized backbone binding has led to PIs characterized by high potency against both wild-type and multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strains. [50] 7.2.

An analysis of the X-ray structure of darunavir-bound HIV-1 protease (Figure 9 ) revealed that the bis-THF ether oxygens are involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the amide N-H groups of Asp29 and Asp30 at a distance of 2.9 and 3.1 , respectively. We conceptualized that incorporation of a larger ring system might promote closer more effective hydrogen bonding to these backbone residues and result in a more favorable alignment between the cyclic ether oxygen and the Asp30 amide N-H bond. These factors might result in stronger hydrogen bonds and higher affinity inhibitors. In addition, a larger ring size may promote favorable hydrophobic interactions within the S2 subsite and allow additional flexibility to better accommodate steric changes caused by protease mutations. Therefore, we synthesized and evaluated a series of PIs containing a tetrahydropyranyl-THF (Tp-THF) P2 ligand. [134] As shown in Figure 26 , consistent with bis-THF, the bicyclic ligand in 39 (GRL-0476) with its 4S configuration is more effective than the epimeric ligand. Like the bis-THF ligand, both cyclic ether oxygens are critical for binding as their respective replacement with methylene groups resulted in a significant loss in potency. We have also prepared PIs 40 and 41 incorporating a p-methoxybenzyl side chain as the P1 ligand and p-methoxysulfonamide and p-aminophenylsulfonamide as the P2' ligands, respectively. Our detailed drugresistance studies of 40 and 41 showed that both PIs were very potent against multi-PI-resistant HIV-1 variants.

Towards this objective, we elected to append functionalities to the bis-THF ligand to further improve the drug-resistance properties of the PIs. As shown in Figure 27 , based upon the overlay of the X-ray structures of darunavirbound [69] and SQV-bound [86] HIV-1 protease, we planned to fill the hydrophobic pocket occupied by the quinaldic moiety of SQV. Particularly, we have speculated that the fusion of another tetrahydrofuran ring on the bis-THF ligand would provide additional ligand binding site interactions. While such an oxatricyclic ligand could have a number of possible stereochemical motifs, including syn-syn-syn (SSS-type) and syn-anti-syn (SAS-type) isomers, our model based upon overlay structures in Figure 27 suggested that the SAS-type ligand-based inhibitor would make enhanced interactions in the S2 subsite.

The third THF ring also participates in a semicircular hydrogenbonding network with three conserved water molecules that surround the guanidine side chain of Arg8.

Nature has been optimizing various cyclic ether/polycyclic ether templates for millions of years in various biological microenvironments involving biosynthetic enzymes. Inspired by nature and based upon X-ray structures of protein-ligand complexes, we invoked the idea of designing stereochemically defined cyclic ether or polyether-like molecular features to replace peptide bonds and effectively fill the hydrophobic pockets in the active site of HIV-1 protease. We envisioned positioning cyclic ether oxygen to mimic the biological action of a peptide carbonyl group and the cyclic functionality would make necessary van der Waals interactions in the hydrophobic pocket. These research efforts led to the creation of a variety of conceptually novel molecular templates that are entirely nonpeptidic but interact with HIV-1 protease with remarkable affinity.
