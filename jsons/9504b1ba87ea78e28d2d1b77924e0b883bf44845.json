Currently, air 38 toxicity is monitored only for single or limited number of known toxicants, thus failing 39 to fully warn against possible hazardous air. Here, using a photoionization detector (PID) 40 or GC-MS/FID we found that within minutes living rats emitted distinctive profiles of 41 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via breath when exposed to various airborne 42 toxicants such as endotoxin, O3, ricin, and CO2. Compared to background indoor air, 43 when exposed to ricin or endotoxin aerosols breath-borne VOC levels, especially that 44 of carbon disulfide, were shown to decrease, while elevated levels were observed for 45 O3 and CO2 exposures. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear contrast 46 in breath-borne VOCs profiles of rats among different toxicant exposures. MicroRNA 47 regulations such as miR-33, miR-146a and miR-155 from rats' blood samples also 48 suggested varying mechanisms used by the rats in combating different air toxicant 49",

In this study, we examined the possibility 553 of using living animals' exhaled VOCs in real-time monitoring air toxicity. Our 554 experimental data showed that when the rats were exposed to air containing various 555 toxicants, characteristic VOC profiles were in vivo produced in the body within 10 556 minutes or shorter, and further emitted via exhaled breath. In addition, different toxicant 557 exposures were shown to have caused productions of distinctive profiles of VOC 558 species from the living rats. Therefore, the developed RSTair system, i.e., by integrating 559 inhalation exposure, living rats, breath sampling and online VOC sensor, was capable 560 of real-time monitoring toxic air. The RSTair system can detect a breath-borne VOC 561 change when the air is becoming toxic to rats. In doing so, the system can real-time 562 alter people of possible air toxicity change or hazardous air. Nonetheless, the PID sensor 563 used in this system only reports the TVOC level without classifying individual VOC 564 species. It should be also noted that the PID sensor responds to different VOCs 565 differently. For example, the PID could respond to one VOC with stronger signal, but 566 to another with weaker one even for the same concentration level. However, this can be 567 readily remedied by using portable direct-injection mass spectrum such as Proton 568",

The VOCs species involved in the PCA 419 analysis were the 12 species which were shown to have undergone changes after each 420 toxicant exposure. Data presented in the figure were from three independent rats 421 exposed to each toxicant. 422 423 As observed from Figure 3, exposure to ricin caused 183\u00b1143% higher 424 concentration of ethyl acetate, while 22% lower concentration of carbon disulfide. It 425 was previously reported the concentration of ethyl acetate was significantly higher in 426 exhaled breath from people with cancer compared to the healthy group . In addition, in 427 vitro experiments have shown the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) 428 can produce ethyl acetate, which is presumably generated by a reaction of ethanol with 429 acetic acid . It was demonstrated that ricin is not only responsible for the ricin 430 intoxication through ribosomal inactivation and subsequent inhibition of protein 431 synthesis and cell death, but also presents endothelial toxicity by acting as a natural 432 disintegrin binding to and damaging human endothelial cells . Therefore, the toxicity of ricin on the endothelial cells might be the source of the higher concentration of ethyl 434 acetate observed in this work. As a disease biomarker, carbon disulfide was observed 435 in the exhaled breath 44-45 . Recently, it was suggested that the carbon disulfide may be 436 generated endogenously and play a role as a bioregulator 46 . Here, we observed that 437 exposure to both ricin and endotoxin resulted in lower levels of breath-borne carbon 438 disulfide compared to the control. 439 440 For CO2 and endotoxin exposure, the observation for acetone was the opposite as 441 shown in Figure 3. Acetone in exhaled breath was widely investigated in many studies 442 as an important biomarker related to blood glucose and diabetes . Acetone is produced 443 in the fatty acids metabolism by hepatocytes via decarboxylation of excess acetyl 444 coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA), and then oxidized via the Krebs cycle in peripheral tissue . 445",

In addition to ethane, the increase of methylcyclopentane level as shown in Figure 3 might also be the result of the 459 endotoxin exposure. Endotoxin has been shown to trigger inflammation through its 460 interaction with the TLR4/CD14/MD2 receptor and then initiates a signal cascade. This 461 reaction correspondingly results in the activation of transcription factor such as NF-\u03baB 462 leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferons (IFNs), 463 and finally results in systemic inflammatory response syndrome . In general, in terms 464 with the average fold changes, the concentration of total VOCs in the exhaled breath 465 was relatively lower after the endotoxin exposure, which agreed with the results of 466 TVOC obtained by the PID sensors. 467 468",

The results above show that 480 regardless of toxicant types breath-borne VOC from rats experienced in vivo changes. 481 to investigate the VOC emission mechanism by rats upon exposure to various types of 484 toxicants. miRNAs are short non-coding RNA sequences that regulate gene expression 485 at the posttranscriptional level; and many miRNAs have already been identified to 486 influence physiological processes such as immune reaction, adaptation to stress, and 487 widely investigated in environmental exposure studies . Among these microRNAs, 488 miR-125b, miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-21 are mainly shown to regulate oxidative 489 stress and inflammatory processes in vivo, and widely investigated in air pollution 490 related studies . For example, among them, miR-155 has a positive regulation function, 491 and the other three are negative regulation . However, in this study, the ozone exposure 492 resulted in decreased levels of miR-155, which are contrary to previous reports in the 493 literature . The specific reasons need further investigations. Previous studies have 494 shown that miR-20b and miR-210 are hypoxia regulators in animals, and miR-122 and 495 miR-33 are mainly responsible for regulating lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism 496 in the body . However, these microRNAs were shown to have not undergone significant 497 changes in this study after the exposures to four different toxicants. The possible reason 498 may be that microRNAs act as post-transcriptional regulators by degrading mRNA or 499 inhibiting their translation , thus failing to respond in a timely manner during short-term 500 exposure (10 min used here for taking blood samples). Nonetheless, observed changes 501 in microRNA levels after the toxicant exposure are related to those VOC level and 502 species changes. 503 504",
