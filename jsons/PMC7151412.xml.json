Specialists and residents were divided into two teams, with each team rostered to clinical areas that were located on two separate levels within the hospital. Staff performing overnight duties were also from the same team. The purpose was to minimise staff interactions and reduce the impact of mandatory staff quarantine orders in the event of an outbreak in our healthcare system. These measures had a significant impact on the delivery of curricular training, which required interactions between learners and consultants. These included classroom-based teaching, clinical supervision, procedural skills and simulation-based training, as well as trainee assessment and feedback. In the absence of routine face-to-face meetings, we anticipated and experienced difficulties in each of these educational elements.",

As only consultants in the same team could asses the resident, the number of available assessors was reduced, which may have resulted in less robust or suboptimal feedback on performance. Moreover, performance could be affected in the direct observation of procedural skills competency assessments by the added psychological stress of additional infection control measures, such as the need for personal protective equipment. Thus, we limited the performance of the direct observation of procedural skills assessments to patients who had been assessed using our institutional guidelines as of \u2018low infection risk\u2019. This required co-ordination between the surgical, anaesthetic and infection control teams.",

However, as the outbreak situation is evolving continually, the training program needs to be reviewed regularly to adapt to any new changes and restrictions.
