            "text": "The signaling pathway of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) regulates cellular processes, including growth, cell proliferation, survival, and motility [1]. The p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK), a family of serine/threonine kinases, are important substrates of ERK [2]. The RSK family consists of four isoforms (RSK1, 2, 3, and 4) and two structurally related RSK-like protein kinases (RLPK/MSK1) and RSK-B (MSK2) in humans [2], [3], [4], [5]. Members of the RSK family contain two distinct kinase domains. The C-terminal kinase domain is thought to be involved in autophosphorylation at the critical step in 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) activation [6], [7], [8]. On the other hand, the N-terminal kinase domain is capable of phosphorylation of substrates. Recent studies have clarified the mechanisms of activation of p90RSK. p90RSK1 is phosphorylated at Thr573 in the activation loop of the C-terminal kinase domain by ERK because the C-terminal of p90RSK has an ERK docking site [9], [10]. Autophosphorylation at Ser380 in the linker region is thought to be induced by activation of the C-terminal kinase domain [11], and then PDK1 phosphorylates at Ser221 in the activation loop of the N-terminal kinase domain [12], [13], [14].",

            "text": "p90RSK is thought to have multiple functions. In quiescent cells, p90RSK is present in the cytoplasm, and p90RSK activated via the ERK signaling pathway by growth factors is imported into the nucleus. p90RSK activates nuclear factor-\u03baB by phosphorylation of I\u03ba-B and phosphorylates the transcription factors, c-Fos and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) [2]. It has been shown that p90RSK plays important roles in apoptosis and the cell cycle. p90RSK phosphorylates Bad [15], [16] and C/EBP\u03b2 [17], which protects cells against apoptosis. Furthermore, p90RSK phosphorylates and inhibits Myt1, which is a p34cdc2 inhibitory kinase, resulting in G2 arrest in Xenopus extracts [18], [19]. In mouse oocytes, Emi1 and p90RSK2 cooperate to induce metaphase arrest [20]. p90RSK also functions as a serum-stimulated Na+/H+ exchanger-1 kinase and regulates its activity [21]. Recently, it has been shown that p90RSK activation induces H2O2-mediated cardiac troponin I phosphorylation, which depresses the acto-myosin interaction and is important during the progression of heart failure [21]. Thus, p90RSK has been demonstrated to play key roles in regulating cellular functions in the ERK signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly discovered infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [22], [23], which spread to more than 30 countries in late 2002, causing severe outbreaks of atypical pneumonia. Our recent studies using the monkey kidney cell line, Vero E6, demonstrated that a variety of signaling pathways are activated upon infection with SARS-CoV. Especially, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is throught to be involved in induction of apoptosis because a p38 inhibitor was able to partially prevent cytopathic effects induced by SARS-CoV infection [24]. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, which is ordinarily phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue, is dephosphorylated by SARS-CoV-induced activation of p38 [25]. c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and Akt are important for establishing persistent SARS-CoV infection [26]. In confluent virus-infected cells, Akt is first phosphorylated at a single serine residue shortly after SARS-CoV infection, and subsequently dephosphorylated during the course of viral infection [27], whereas Akt, which is ordinary phosphorylated at a serine residue, was dephosphorylated by SARS-CoV infection without any upregulation of its phosphorylation in subconfluent cells [28]. This downregulation of Akt phosphorylation induces inhibition of cell proliferation by SARS-CoV infection and weak activation of Akt cannot induce escape from SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis. Nucleocapsid protein, X1 and spike proteins of SARS-CoV are able to induce apoptosis in their expressing cells [29], [30], [31], [32]. Especially, N protein is able to upregulation of phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK, but not ERK and Akt [29]. Although ERK was shown to be phosphorylated in SARS-CoV-infected cells [25], the function is not clear. p90RSK is a well-known substrate for ERK as described above.",

Furthermore, we demonstrated that activation of p38 MAPK was responsible for phosphorylation of Ser380 in virus-infected cells. These results indicated signaling pathways, which are different from those induced by growth factor, contribute to phosphorylation of p90RSK in SARS-CoV-infected cells.",

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 1\n, SARS-CoV-infected confluent Vero E6 cells induced phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of signaling pathways as also described in previous studies [24], [27], [28]. The cytopathic effects (CPEs) were observed in Vero E6 cells at 24-h post-infection (h.p.i.). DNA fragmentation as an indicator of apoptosis was detected at 24 h.p.i. [24]. Among the signaling pathways activated by SARS-CoV infection, p38 MAPK is thought to act as a pro-apoptotic signaling pathway, whereas Akt has an anti-apoptotic effect. Vero cells, the parental cells of Vero E6, are also sensitive to SARS-CoV infection. However, the time point of the appearance of CPE on Vero cells by SARS-CoV infection is later than that of Vero E6 cells at 24 h.p.i. (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV was detected at 17 h.p.i. in both cell lines. The level of N protein in Vero cells was only slightly lower than that in Vero E6 cells, indicating that replication of SARS-CoV is not markedly different between the two cell lines. Anti-apoptotic Akt was phosphorylated at 17 h.p.i. in both cell lines, and was dephosphorylated at 27 h.p.i. (Fig. 1B). Our previous study indicated that phosphorylation level of Akt around 17 h.p.i. is only 20% of phosphorylated Akt in growing cells [28]. Therefore, this low level of activation cannot prevent apoptosis by SARS-CoV infection. Fig. 1B also shows that ERK was phosphorylated at 17 h.p.i. in both cell lines, similar to the observations regarding Akt. The apoptotic markers, PARP (p85) and cleaved caspase-3 and -7, were detected in Vero E6 and Vero cells at 27 and 44 h.p.i., respectively (Fig. 1A). The p38 MAPK in virus-infected Vero E6 and Vero cells was phosphorylated at 17 and 27 h.p.i., respectively (Fig. 1A). Tyrosine of STAT3 was also dephosphorylated via phosphorylation of p38 MAPK as reported previously [25]. Thus, SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis related to time-dependent activation of the pro-apoptotic signaling pathway, p38 MAPK. Taken together, these results suggested that substrates of PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK are important for understanding the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV infection.",

Ser221 of p90RSK1 is phosphorylated by PDK-1 and Thr359, Ser363, and Thr573 of p90RSK-1 are phosphorylated by ERK. p90RSK is thought to play important roles in apoptosis and the cell cycle. Both PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling pathways are activated early post-infection with SARS-CoV in both Vero and Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1B). Therefore, p90RSK may be a target of both signaling pathways in SARS-CoV-infected cells. At least four species of p90RSK (p90RSK1, 2, 3, and 4) has been reported to date [2], [3], [4], [5]. We used anti-p90RSK antibodies, which do not cross-react with other p90RSK family members, as described in the legend of Fig. 2\n. We measured densities of RSK1 and 2 bands in Vero E6 cells using LAS-3000 mini system (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The amount of p90RSK1 in subconfluent cells, p90RSK2 in confluent cells and p90RSK2 in subconfluent cells were 73.05%, 39.94% and 14.70% of RSK1 in confluent cells, respectively. Although affinity of each antibody is different, this result suggested that p90RSK1 was expressed stronger than p90RSK2 in Vero E6 cells. p90RSK1 is expressed mainly in the human kidney, lung, and pancreas, whereas p90RSK2 is expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and pancreas [33]. p90RSK3 and 4 were not detected in Vero E6 and HeLa cells in the present study. The p90RSK4 was weakly detected in K562 and Jurkat cells.",

Our previous study indicated that very low levels of Akt in confluent Vero E6 cells are phosphorylated at serine, whereas the level is high in subconfluent cells [28]. However, the phosphorylated threonine of Akt is difficult to detect in subconfluent Vero E6 cells. We only detected it weakly when the cells were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) at 1 min [28]. As threonine of Akt was transiently phosphorylated by EGF treatment, it was never detected after 5 min. On the other hand, serine of Akt was easily phosphorylated by treatment with EGF after 3 min. The threonine residue of Akt is phosphorylated by PDK-1, and the serine residue of Akt is thought to be phosphorylated by the putative kinase, PDK-2. To compare the phosphorylation level of PDK-1 at different cell densities, Vero E6 cells were prepared at 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.6, and 0.3 \u00d7 105 cells in 5% FBS containing DMEM per well in 6-well plates. At a density of 10 \u00d7 105 cells, Vero E6 cells showed 100% confluence in this experiment. As shown in Fig. 3\nA, the level of PDK-1 phosphorylation was similar at all cell densities. Ser221 of p90RSK was also phosphorylated at a similar level. The confluency of Vero E6 cells in the present study is shown in Fig. 3B. To confirm that the phosphorylation levels of PDK-1 and p90RSK Ser221 were unaffected by cell proliferation, Vero E6 cells were cultured in medium containing low and high concentrations of FBS. Cell proliferation of Vero E6 cells was partially suppressed in medium containing 0.2% FBS as compared with 5% FBS (Fig. 3C). Confluent and subconfluent cells in medium containing 5\u20130.2% FBS showed similar phosphorylation levels of PDK-1 and p90RSK at Ser221 (Fig. 3D). Thus, the phosphorylation level of Ser221 of p90RSK is not influenced by the status of cell proliferation.",

Activation of the C-terminal domain by the ERK signaling pathway is thought to be necessary for phosphorylation at Ser380 [34]. Fig. 4\nA indicates that EGF treatment induces phosphorylation of ERK in Vero E6 cells. Both Thr573 and Ser380 of p90RSK were phosphorylated early after EGF treatment. Interestingly, the phosphorylation level of p90RSK Ser221 was not altered by EGF treatment. To investigate whether cell density affects phosphorylation level of p90RSK Thr573 and Ser380, Western blotting analysis was performed using proteins obtained from 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.6, and 0.3 \u00d7 105 cells in DMEM containing 5% FBS per well in 6-well plates. Fig. 4B shows that Ser380 of p90RSK phosphorylation was increased by decreasing cell density. Although Thr573 was also increased phosphorylation by decreasing cell density, the amount was very low. The amount of Thr573 phosphorylated p90RSK in 0.3 \u00d7 105 cells is only 11.53% of Ser380 using LAS-3000 mini system. Therefore, the band of Thr573 phosphorylated p90RSK was difficult to see in Fig. 4B.",

The Thr573 was slightly phosphorylated in subconfluent mock infected cells compared with confluent mock infected cells (Fig. 4B). However, the phosphorylation was decreased by SARS-CoV-infection and was abolished by the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor, PD98059 (data not shown). Therefore, the ERK signaling pathway is involved in phosphorylation of Thr573 in Vero E6 cells. These observations raise a question regarding the role of ERK in SARS-CoV-infected cells. PD98059-treated SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells showed no significant changes in activated caspase-3 or -7 at 18 h.p.i. (data not shown). This result suggested that phosphorylation of ERK was not sufficient to prevent apoptosis by SARS-CoV infection, as discussed previously regarding the lack of an inhibitory effect on apoptosis due to low activation of Akt in virus-infected cells [27]. Furthermore, we found different phosphorylation kinetics between ERK1 and ERK2 in EGF-treated and SARS-CoV-infected cells. Interestingly, the phosphorylation level of ERK1 is similar to that of ERK2 in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1B). Among several experiments, the phosphorylation level of ERK1 was sometimes higher than that of ERK2, as in the case of virus-infected Vero cells at 27 and 44 h.p.i. (Fig. 1B). The total amounts of ERK1 were lower than those of total ERK2 in both mock- and SARS-CoV-infected cells. To confirm that factors contained in seed virus do not upregulate phosphorylation of ERK1, SARS-CoV in seed virus was completely neutralized by anti-SARS-CoV antibody, and then added to cells, resulting in no upregulation of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (data not shown). Thus, the strong phosphorylation of ERK1 occurred specifically in SARS-CoV-infected cells. In the case of EGF stimulation, the phosphorylation level of ERK1 was lower than that of ERK2 (Fig. 4A). Eblen et al. showed that ERK2 phosphorylates p90RSK [34]. Angenstein et al. identified p90RSK, ERK2, and GSK-3\u03b2 as poly-associated proteins, suggesting that polyribosome-bound ERK2 activates p90RSK, and then inhibits GSK-3\u03b2 [36]. Thus, ERK2 activation is important for phosphorylation of p90RSK in the absence of viral infection. On the other hand, the strong phoshorylation of ERK1 in SARS-CoV-infected cells may affect on phosphorylation status of p90RSK as discussed below.",

The phosphorylation level of Ser380 in confluent Vero E6 cells was very low, and SARS-CoV infection induced phosphorylation of Ser380 (Fig. 5). However, as described above, upregulation of Thr573 was not observed in virus-infected cells. There may be differences in regulation of Ser380 in SARS-CoV-infected cells from other stimuli. In the present study, we showed that p38 MAPK can induce phosphorylation of Ser380. Several reports have suggested that p90RSK activation results in phosphorylation of CREB [2], [41]. Our previous study showed that SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells induces phosphorylation of CREB, and treatment with SB203580 can inhibit this phosphorylation [24]. Thus, phosphorylation of CREB is regulated by p38 MAPK in SARS-CoV-infected cells. In addition, phosphorylation of ERKs was partially downregulated by treatment with SB203580 in virus-infected cells in viral infected cells (data not shown). Although there is a possibility of nonspecific reaction by SB203580, cross-talk between ERK and p38 has been reported [37], [38], [39]. On the other hand, EGF stimulation induces phosphorylation of ERK without phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 4A). Several signaling pathways of p38 MAPK and ERKs including cross-talk may exist in Vero E6 cells. These results may indicate a signaling cascade, p38 MAPK > (ERK >) p90RSK > CREB, in virus-infected cells. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the roles of p90RSK in virus-infected cells.",

Western blotting analysis was performed using the same amounts of protein. According to the antibody product data sheets, anti-human p90RSK1 monoclonal antibody (Epitomics) does not cross-react with other RSK family members. Anti-human and mouse p90RSK2 antibody (Zymed) does not react with overexpressed p90RSK1, 3, or 4. Anti-human p90RSK3 antibody (Zymed) does not react with overexpressed p90RSK1, 2, or 4. Anti-human p90RSK antibody (Zymed) does not react with p90RSK1, 2, or 3. Anti-p90RSK1/2/3 antibody (Cell Signaling) detects endogenous levels of RSK1, RSK2, and RSK3 proteins. In Vero E6 cells, the band of RSK1 was stronger than that of RSK2 as described in the text. The weak bands were enhanced using Adobe Photoshop.",
