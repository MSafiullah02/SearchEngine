Half of the domestic bird breeds are currently considered to be endangered (Dohner, 2001) for various reasons, mainly related to restructuring of rural areas and human agriculture, commercial needs, and exposure to health risks. A total of 154 chicken breeds and lines have been described in France (Tixier-Boichard et al., 2001), representing a wide diversity of populations managed by amateurs, research institutes, and commercial breeders. They are exposed to risks of epidemics (e.g., avian influenza). Small populations are also exposed to management failure and deleterious inbreeding. These resources could be saved by conservation programs (Pisenti et al., 1999; Alderson et al., 2003; Blackburn, 2004, 2006; Woelders et al., 2006).",

In addition, ex situ conservation is a strategic tool to secure genetic diversity, particularly considering the risks of epidemic diseases. This is the main reason why ex situ conservation should be associated with known health status of donors, to provide safe biological material for further population management. Cryopreservation represents excellent complementary support to in situ conservation and may also be used in selection programs (Alderson et al., 2003; Danchin-Burge and Hiemstra, 2003).",

However, only the male genome is conserved because in birds the female is the heterogametic sex. Therefore, in backcrossing, it would take 1 to 6 generations (depending on the genotype and need) to return to the desired genotype after semen cryopreservation. Cryopreservation of embryos and oocytes would make it possible to retain the W chromosome, but such techniques cannot be used because of the characteristics of the megalecithal egg (Blesbois and Labb\u00e9, 2003; Massip et al., 2004). The cryopreservation of blastoderm cells or primordial germ cells followed by their reimplantation in recipient embryos may provide interesting alternatives (Van de Lavoir et al., 2006). Such embryos may result in chimeric birds able to generate progeny of the donor genotype with a very low germ-line transmission rate (Tajima, 2002)). However, this method is not sufficiently effective and is too costly for large programs of genetic conservation (Petite, 2006).",

Semen was routinely collected twice a week by massage (Burrows and Quinn, 1937), and sperm concentration, motility, and viability (see Blesbois et al., 2002) were assessed. Sperm concentration was determined by light absorption of semen with a photometer (IMV, L'Aigle, France) at a wavelength of 545 nm (Brillard and Mc Daniel, 1985). Mass motility (subjective evaluation of the speed of the movements of a group of sperm in 20 \u03bcL of semen), ranging from 0 to 9, was measured by subjective observation under a light microscope (250\u00d7), giving a general view of the type and intensity of spermatozoa movement and the impact of movement on the number and size of agglutinations. As an example, the highest notation, 9, represented samples with rapid swirls of sperm, and the notation 1 represented sperm mostly agglutinated, very few of them moving. Semen viability was measured after staining with SyBr14/IP fluorescent dyes (Chalah and Brillard, 1998) or with eosinnigrosin smears (Blom, 1950). Proportions of viable spermatozoa were then observed under the microscope. The 20 best donors for each line were kept for further semen freezing. For this choice, we retained only the males that gave ejaculates with a minimum concentration of 3 \u00d7 109 spermatozoa/mL and a minimum volume of 250 \u03bcL.",

Consequently, of the 549 initially incubated eggs, 338 were fertile and 177 chicks were obtained with a balanced sex ratio. Hatching rates varied from 11 to 62% for the 8 breeders that provided fertile eggs (Table 3\n). Maintenance of negativity to Mycoplasma synoviae required further Tiamulin inoculations during the rearing period (including the 3 first months in isolators) checked by PCR on tracheal swabs.",

Groups of 3 to 4 females were inseminated per male with 2 to 9 inseminations until backcross 3. Depending on the total number of doses and on the decision to use all the stored material or not, backcrossing should be continued until backcross 4 or 5. The number of straws used increased in subfertile lines with the percentage of the donor genome, and this was taken into account from backcross 2. For the last backcross generation, a higher number of males (8 to 10) was used to produce a higher number of birds representing all the family origins of the restored line. Because the fertility test yielded numbers of fertile eggs but not numbers of chicks, a 10% embryo mortality rate was assumed to derive a number of chicks from numbers of fertile eggs. Then a 50% sex ratio was assumed, and the proportion of female chicks becoming fertile adult females was set at 75%, which is a rather conservative hypothesis. According to these options, the total stock of frozen semen would be used for the B4 line and the Gauloise dor\u00e9e breed to restore a line with 96.875% identity to the original population. A higher number of stored doses made it possible to continue until backcross 5 in the R+ line, with 98.43% recovery of the original genome. The same recovery rate was obtained for the Y33 line but required only 55% of the stored straws, so that it would still be possible to add a further backcross generation to reach 99.21% of the initial genome.",

These methods mainly use DMA or glycerol and 2 different methods of packaging of frozen semen (pellets or straws). Two of these methods were of similar effectiveness: the method using DMA and pellets and the one using glycerol and straws (Tselutin et al., 1999). The DMA method was much easier to perform because it does not need removal of the cryoprotectant at thawing in contrast to the glycerol method. However, the use of frozen semen from a cryobank requires strict identification of each sample. Pellets are not convenient in these conditions. One of the preliminary experiments of the present study was to prepare a freezing method that combined the use of DMA as cryoprotectant with straws as semen packaging. However, the fertility results of this method were lower than when the glycerol method was used (Table 4). Previous works in our laboratory (Blesbois and Grasseau, 2002; Labb\u00e9 et al., 2003) indicated that straws were less efficient than pellets to restore fertility of chicken or turkey semen frozen with DMA cryoprotectant. This could be due to an effective difference in sperm freezing curve between the 2 procedures (pellets or straws) or to a deleterious interaction between DMA and the plastic of the straws. In the case of normally fertile breeds, the decrease in fertility, which is induced by the use of DMA with straws (compared with DMA with pellets), is not dramatic, and this method may be recommended because it is easier than the glycerol method. However, most of the chicken lines chosen for the present study were subfertile, and our objective was to obtain chicks in every case after semen freezing. The results presented on Table 4 showed that this objective could probably not be fulfilled by the use of DMA and straws. Although their technique requires a higher technical skill, we selected the cryopreservation method of Seigneurin and Blesbois (1995) for the continued studies of semen cryopreservation.",

For the other populations, the fertility results were much lower with homologous females and markedly improved after insemination in heterologous females, indicating that female fertility was also decreased in these populations. This decrease in female fertility was possibly a result of inbreeding (B4 and R+ lines), of metabolic characteristics of the line (R+; Morisson et al., 1997), or because of marked seasonality and lack of adaptation of the females to the new environment of the experimental facilities (Gauloise dor\u00e9e breed).",

This is important to avoid transmission of infectious diseases by frozen semen and should be mandatory for the quality assurance of a cryobank. The introduction of the Gauloise dor\u00e9e breed into the cryobank was very interesting in this respect because, in its usual breeding conditions, this breed was contaminated by the legally controlled pathogen bacteria encountered in poultry (Salmonella and mycoplasma). The screening and remediation of diseases of this strain was therefore absolutely necessary and required the treatment of 2 successive generations of animals because of the existence of unaffected carriers and of the potential vertical transmission of pathogens from the dam to the egg. The procedure consisted of repeated treatments with Baytril for the parents followed by Tiamulin for embryos and chicks. Tiamulin was chosen for the second generation because Salmonella and mycoplasma are highly chemo-sensitive to this drug (Kempf et al., 1988; Cerda et al., 2002). However, a certain degree of toxicity is possible with Tiamulin injection, particularly for the embryo. The toxicity test for Tiamulin injection in 8-d-old embryos showed a deleterious effect of the injection itself in our experimental conditions, with a mean loss of 30% of hatched eggs. Tiamulin had an additional deleterious effect at a dose of 40 mg/kg. Because of the toxicity of Tiamulin injection to the embryo, a low dose (10 mg/kg) was chosen, which did not result in total eradication of mycoplasma. Further injections and the elimination of chicks resistant to treatment were necessary to ensure total eradication. Technical solutions were thus found but at a high cost. Setting up programs to detect and eliminate disease in local breeds would be a valuable alternative in the future to improve the general health status of poultry breeds and decrease the cost of cryobanking.",

We must emphasize that a standardized procedure of ex situ preservation of strains in good technical conditions is still expensive in birds.

The difference in number of straws between lines (ratio of 1:2) was mainly related to the biological characteristics of the lines. The rearing conditions were the same for all the males used for semen freezing. However, the Gauloise dor\u00e9e breed was unique. The adult males of this breed had an especially short reproductive period with a short duration of semen production coupled with poor semen quality. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that this breed is usually reared in extensive farming conditions and may have retained pronounced characteristics of seasonality that have been lost by most other breeds. Another difficulty with the Gauloise dor\u00e9e breed was the highly unbalanced contributions of the breeders to the final stock of frozen semen. This was due not only to unequal numbers of eggs but also to differences in hatchability and in semen production and quality of adult males. Successful cryobanking for a local breed should therefore involve the largest possible number of breeders because it is almost impossible to assess the on-farm fertility of animals of noncommercial populations.",

This was particularly true for fertility obtained after artificial insemination of frozen-thawed semen with females of the same strain, which ranged from 7 to 68% (Table 6).",

Blood samples could be used for molecular studies, screening for alleles of a gene of interest, and choosing to use a subset of frozen semen to study new alleles. A wide range of possibilities can be compared that would go beyond the purpose of this paper. Nevertheless, it seems that the B4 line would not benefit greatly from such possibilities because of its very low fertility as a pure line. Possible uses should also be decided without forgetting that one major objective of the cryobank is for long-term storage. Thus, specific uses should be compensated for by a new collection stage to maintain the stock of frozen semen.",

Molecular markers may be used to identify the differences in genomic regions between the restored line and the donor line.

We must ensure the development and durability of this structure. This is in process, and 12 other experimental lines of the species Gallus gallus are now under study for inclusion in the cryobank. However, it must be understood that the susceptibility to cryopreservation of sperm collected from different lines and species of domestic poultry is highly variable, and will require the development of new predictors of semen suitability for cryopreservation. It will be also very important to be able to include other bird species (turkeys, muscovy and pekin ducks, gander, guinea fowl) in cryobanks, and this will first require the standardization of semen freezing procedures in each of these species.",
