            "text": "Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and the most common cause of death in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) [1]. Dysglycemia and optimal glycemic control remain important prognostic factors in patients with sepsis [2, 3]. Glycemic variability (GV) has recently been reported to be the third domain of sepsis-induced dysglycemia in addition to hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia [4]. However, there is no universal standard for how best to determine GV in patients with sepsis, particularly the number and timing of blood sugar samples required [5]. Previous studies have reported that a wide range of blood sugar samples are needed to calculate GV, ranging from 1 to 5 times/day [6, 7]. Moreover, a previous study using a continuous glucose monitoring system reported that a relatively small number of blood sugar samples in critically ill patients may underestimate GV [8]. When to determine GV in patients with sepsis is another important issue. GV in the early phase of sepsis may reflect a physiological response to stress; whereas in the later phase it may be affected by a variety of factors related to management, including nutritional intake and glucose control strategy [9, 10]. Previous studies have shown an association between mortality and GV in general ICU patients and selected ICU patients, such as those with diabetes [11\u201313]. However, few studies have focused on GV in the first 24 h of ICU admission due to sepsis, and thus the association between mortality and early GV in sepsis warrants further investigations. Therefore, we conducted this study with retrospective analysis of patients with sepsis who received protocol-based management with blood sugar monitoring every 2 h after ICU admission. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of high GV and to determine the association between GV and mortality.",

Databases of the sepsis management registry and electronic medical records which were collected prospectively were used for analysis. We retrospectively screened all of the adult patients listed in the sepsis management registry database between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2015. In total, 517 consecutive patients who were admitted to the ICU with sepsis and received protocolized bundle care were included. The bundle care included antibiotic administration, pathogen identification and culture, lactate measurement, fluid resuscitation and vasopressors to stabilize hemodynamics. A protective ventilator strategy was used for the patients with respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation by targeting tidal volume at 6 ml/kg and limiting the plateau pressure to less than 30 cm H2O. Glycemic control aiming at keeping blood sugar levels between 150 and 180 mg/dL was achieved using protocolized continuous insulin infusion. Blood glucose was monitored every 2 h for the first 24 h of ICU admission. Given that arterial catheter insertion is part of standard care for patients with sepsis, we used arterial blood instead of capillary blood for point-of-care testing using a glucose meter. The sepsis management registry and electronic medical records databases were used to obtain critical care-associated data, including demographics, comorbidities, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serial glucose data, and other relevant data.",

We used two measures to assess GV: mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and coefficient of variation (CoV). Briefly, MAGE is the mean blood glucose value exceeding the standard deviation (SD) from the 24-h mean blood glucose level [15], and CoV represents the ratio of the SD to the mean glucose level [16]. We used MAGE 65 mg/dL as the cut-off point given that a normal MAGE has been reported to be approximately less than 65 mg/dL [15, 17], and a CoV of 30% based on a previous study exploring dysglycemia in patients with sepsis [18].",

With regards to the sepsis-related data, the severity of sepsis was high as evidenced by a high APACHE II score in both groups (27.5 \u00b1 6.6 in the high GV group vs. 27.3 \u00b1 6.6 in the low GV group, p = 0.70). The patients in the high GV group appeared to have a higher serum lactate level at 0 h (29.1 \u00b1 27.4 vs. 24.5 \u00b1 20.1 mg/dL, p = 0.05) and at 24 h (24.1 \u00b1 23.6 vs. 19.9 \u00b1 15.9, p = 0.10) than those in the low GV group. Moreover, the patients in the high GV group had a higher 30-day mortality rate compared to those in the low GV group (36.7% vs. 26.6%, p = 0.03). Given that DM is highly associated with a high GV, we investigated the specific role of DM in the association between GV and 30-day mortality. We used Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis to test the correlation between GV and 30-day mortality, which showed that higher GV was associated with a higher risk of 30-day mortality (log-rank test, p = 0.018) (Fig. 2). The positive association between GV and 30-day mortality remained strong in the non-DM subgroup (log-rank test, p = 0.035), but was no longer present in the DM subgroup (log-rank test, p = 0.254) (Fig. 3). We also analyzed the GV between DM and non-DM groups in this study, and found that the patients with DM had higher GV including MAGE and CoV compared to those without DM. In this cohort, 30-day mortality was unaffected by DM (Fig. 4). Furthermore, in a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model adjusted for demographic, glycemia-associated and 30-day mortality-associated data (Additional file 1: Table S1), including age, sex, HbA1c, severe hypoglycemic episodes, cerebrovascular disease, hemoglobin and creatinine, APACHE II score (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.045, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.013\u20131.078), level of lactate at 0 h (aHR 1.009, 95% CI 1.003\u20131.014), having a diagnosis of chronic airway disease (aHR 0.483, 95% CI 0.305\u20130.764), level of mean day 1 glucose (aHR 1.008, 95% CI 1.000\u20131.016), and high MAGE (aHR 1.607, 95% CI 1.008\u20132.563) were independently associated with 30-day mortality (Table 2). These findings showed that both mean day 1 glucose level and high MAGE were independently associated with 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis, and highlighted the importance of monitoring GV in critically ill patients.\n\n\n",

The multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model, adjusted for the same variables used for MAGE, showed that a high GV (determined by CoV > 30%) was also independently associated with high 30-day mortality (aHR 2.593, 95% CI 1.494\u20134.499) (Table 3).

            "text": "GV refers to fluctuations in blood glucose level, which is a common stress response. However, there is currently no general consensus on its definition. The prevalence of GV in septic patients is unknown, which may partly be due to the lack of a standardized measurement of GV [20]. In addition, the timing of GV in patients with sepsis is also important, because it may have different clinical significance. GV in the early phase can be the result of a stress response, and late-phase GV may reflect the overall treatment responses. One strength of the present study is that all of the enrolled patients received regular glucose monitoring every 2 h, and an average of 10.6 \u00b1 2.4 glucose measurements were taken within the initial 24 h of ICU admission. This early and intensive glucose monitoring enabled us to investigate the prevalence of high GV in the early phase of septic patients, and also its association with 30-day mortality. In line with our findings, Ali et al. reported that GV was associated with hospital mortality in patients with sepsis using all available glucose values for the entire hospitalization for sepsis in an administrative dataset [21]. In addition, a recent study focusing on the early phase of sepsis using all available glucose values within 48 h after admission via the emergency department, reported that CoV > 30% was associated with in-hospital mortality. However, due to the retrospective design and the difficulty of protocol-based intensive glucose monitoring in an emergency department, only 24.9% (1537/6165) of the patients had more than two blood glucose values within 48 h. In addition, the diagnosis of DM was limited due to the lack of HbA1c values in the patients without DM [18]. Taken together, these findings suggest the importance of GV in critically ill patients. Our findings further showed the prevalence of high GV in the early phase of sepsis through intensive glucose monitoring. It is therefore unsurprising that a high GV has been proposed to be incorporated into the severity score for critically ill patients [22].",

Silveira et al. retrospectively used glucose values from capillary blood during the overall ICU stay to determine MAGE in patients with sepsis, and reported that the patients with DM tended to have a higher GV than those without DM [25]. In the present study, we also found that the patients with DM had higher GV including MAGE and CoV than those without DM (Fig. 4a, b). Moreover, in our previous study, we also identified that a low glucose level (\u2264 120 mg/dL) under glycemic control in patients with sepsis was associated with an increased risk of 14-day mortality in non-DM patients, but not in DM patients [26]. Therefore, septic patients with DM may have a higher tolerability to GV than septic patients without DM. In line with these findings, Krinsley et al. demonstrated that increased GV was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality among patients without DM. They also suggested that patients with DM may benefit from a higher glucose target range than those without DM [11]. The difference in tolerability to GV between patients with and without DM is complex, however it is likely that GV in patients with DM may reflect underlying variations in insulin secretion or sensitivity, whereas GV in patients without DM during sepsis may represent a survival response through interactions between insulin signaling pathways, particularly the GLUT-4 pathway, and activation of pro-inflammatory cascades during sepsis as proposed in so-called stress hyperglycemia [27, 28]. However, the association between GV and mortality may be due to an epiphenomenon of sepsis-associated dysglycemia instead of iatrogenic management; therefore, attempts to manipulate GV may not lead to improved outcomes.",

Third, we focused on day 1 glucose alone in the present study, given that the retrospective design did not allow us to precisely assess the GV beyond day 1. Fourth, the generalizability of the finding should be applied with caution given the high rates of male patients and patients with DM in this study which was conducted at a veteran\u2019s hospital.
