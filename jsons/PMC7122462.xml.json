Since then, 31 pandemics were counted, of which three in the last century: 1918 (Spanish flu), 1957 (Asian flu) and 1968 (Hong Kong flu). Spanish flu was the most virulent, decimating the population at the end of First World War. There are detailed descriptions of three centers of contagion: Brest (France), Boston (USA) and Freetown (Sierra Leone). If the number of deaths in the period 1918\u20131919 exceeded twenty millions, it is estimated that a new imminent pandemic will sick 30% of the world population, determining between 20 and 100 millions of deaths [1]. The concern to avoid this calamity is coordinated by international organizations as WHO, FAO, EIO. At European level this concern was emphasized by preparing national preventing plans for the potential pandemic in 18 of the 25 European Union countries. These plans consist of programs of rapid preparation for efficient vaccines and the assurance of safety stocks for anti-flu medicines. Totally, 24 European countries including Romania, have achieved such plans at the end of 2005, countering more than 30 measures, which fast implemented in case of pandemic, will minimize the its impact.",

Although the flu etiology isn\u2019t always confirmed, its prevalence is considerable in extreme ages: children under 3 year old and people beyond 65 year old. During epidemic periods, happening once in 3\u20134 years due to antigenic shifting, the mortality in aged people increases 3\u20135 times. At present, the circulating human stems are A H1N1, A H3N2 and B. The pandemic stems appear due to recombining among human and aquatic birds stems. This recombining type appears frequently in the South-East of Asia due to the proximity of man-birds and density of population [3]. In this area there is no flu-seasonality and the surveillance must be extended the whole year. Other scenarios for the emergence of pandemic types confer a role to the direct human transmission of avian stems which acquire human tropism, leading to man to man transmission. This possibility is carefully investigated for avian types A H5N1, circulating from some years in the South-East of Asia. It was suggested also, the possibility of recycling old pandemic types, remained latent in an animal reservoir which could be transmitted to young generations, highly susceptible from the immunologic point of view [4]. This scenario explained the re-apparition of H1N1 type in 1977\u20131978 (Table 1).\n\n",

The detection of clusters of cases, closely related in time and place, is likely to be the most important epidemiological signal of such transition [6]. An epidemiological signal may manifest itself as an increase in the number of persons with unexplained respiratory illness in a defined area over a short period of time. This pattern of unexplained respiratory illness should be different from that usually seen in the area. Observations with H5N1 infections to date suggest that a cluster of five closely related cases (including the index case) in which human-to-human transmission is suspected would constitute a signal [7].",

Without exception, the very pathogenic types belong to sub-types H5 and H7, the neuraminidase not being essential for the virulence [9]. The highly pathogen viruses in some bird species may act as opportunistic in other species. Among domestic species, the chickens and the turkeys are highly susceptible to HPAI types, while the ducks and the gooses are resistant. The transmission route for all avian flu viruses is fecal-oral (especially in aquatic birds) and by air (especially in domestic birds living in high density).The post-proteolytic activation of H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) is essential for the infective power, dissemination-excretion and virulence (Table 3). The viruses LPAI are activated by enzymes acting in blood coagulation, or by bacterial proteases present in normal conditions, in different bird species [10, 11]. The acquisition of new cleavage sites in flu HA sequences is determinant for the conversion of non-virulent stems in virulent ones and for the host spectrum change [12]. In last 5 years, 4 new types of flu viruses type A have appeared: H1N1 and H2N7 (in USA), H9N2 in Holland and H5N1 in South-East of Asia and even in Siberia and Kazahstan. It is difficult to predict the pandemic potential of these stems but it is obvious that H5N1 evolution imposes a high alert level.\n\n",
