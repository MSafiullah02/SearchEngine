Data collected by the Health Interview Survey have demonstrated the overall scope of these illnesses. 1 The Health Interview Survey defines acute conditions as those not lasting more than 3 months but requiring a physician consultation or restriction of daily activity. Only illnesses with onsets in the 2 weeks before the survey were reported. Table 1 shows the 1995 survey data on all acute conditions, categorized by age of the patient and, more specifically, by conditions involving the respiratory tract. Of all acute illnesses, respiratory conditions are the most common, generally occurring twice as frequently as the next most common condition. 1 Within the category of respiratory conditions, influenza was reported more frequently than the common cold, despite the fact that colds occur more commonly. Illnesses were identified based simply by name, and not based on clinical characteristics. Furthermore, the specific questions varied over time. This is likely because of the fact that reporting in this survey was limited to more severe conditions (those involving a physician consultation or restricted activity), which are more apt to be recalled by the respondent. Therefore, in the Health Interview Survey the incidence of influenza is probably overestimated and that of the common cold underestimated. Although this survey may not represent the true incidence of these infections, the data do report all respiratory illnesses in the context of conditions requiring physician consultation.

In the Tecumseh study, rhinoviruses were by far the most frequent viral isolate identified in the overall population (Figure 3 ). 10 In the first phase of the study, an infectious agent was detected in only approximately 25% of the specimens collected. 2 Not all specimens collected yielded virus isolates, partly because advanced diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were not available at the time the study was conducted. Table 6 shows the annual isolation rates of various respiratory viruses by age (actual rates per 1,000 person-years) during the second phase of the study, from 1976 to 1981. Rates per 100 person-years were adjusted by the proportion of illnesses actually sampled. 8 The adjustments approximate isolation rates as if all infections had been sampled. Both rates were based on actual isolation of virus. Nonculturable viruses, or those lost during shipping from the site to the laboratory, were not included. Again, in this second phase, rhinoviruses were the most frequently isolated agents in all age groups.

Rhinovirus rates were adjusted based on a study of the common cold in which previous organ culture technique identified viruses that did not replicate in ordinary cell culture. Based on these studies, rhinoviruses were still the most common isolate. Of note is the large percentage of illnesses for which the cause could not be determined.
