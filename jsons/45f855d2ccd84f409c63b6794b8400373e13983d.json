S protein is metastable, and binding of RBD to hACE2 receptor likely leads to the shedding of S1 protein from S2 protein, thus promoting S2-mediated virus-host membrane fusion and virus entry. [16] [17] [18] Given the critical role of the RBD in initiating invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, it becomes a vulnerable target for neutralizing antibodies. Thus far, the human mAbs specifically target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-hACE2 interaction have not been reported, and a monoclonal antibody targeting S1 made from immunized transgenic mice expressing human Ig variable heavy and light chains has been recently shown to neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection, but by an unknown mechanism that is independent of the blockade of RBD-hACE2 interaction. 19 Prior to cloning SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific human mAbs, we first examined whether patients recently recovered from COVID-19 had mounted anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein IgG antibodies in sera. Among 26 recovered COVID-19 patients, we found that the majority of these recruited patients were able to produce high titers of SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific IgG antibodies and only three patients mounted relatively lower anti-S1 IgG responses, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 1a) . Consistently, we also found that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies were present in sera of all patients by ELISA (Fig. 1b) . Next, we sought to investigate whether RBD-specific antibodies in patient serum can block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to hACE2. To this end, we set up an ELISA-based inhibition assay to examine the blocking function of these antibodies. We noted that there were only 3 out of 26 patients showed effective blockade of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to hACE2 (Fig. 1c) . Taken together, these results suggested that while all recovered COVID-19 patients can generate anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibodies, there were only a small fraction of these antibodies can block the binding of RBD to hACE2 receptor. This observation may be explained by transient and dynamic perfusion conformational states of S protein that provide a very limited window for the immunogenic epitopes of RBD exposure to specific B cells. 20 Next, we set out to clone human mAbs using the blood samples from three COVID-19 recovered patients, of which their sera showed potent hACE2 receptor binding inhibition. To this end, we sorted each SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific, IgG class-switched memory B cell into a single well of the 96-well microplates. Subsequently, we used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to amplify IgG variable heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) from each single memory B cell. After cloning both VH and VL, we inserted both sequences into expression plasmids that encoding constant regions of human IgG1 heavy chain and light chain (Fig. 1d) . 21 We found that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific, IgG-positive memory B cells only enriched in COVID-19 recovered patients, but not in healthy controls (Fig. 1e) , suggesting the specificity of our sorting strategy. After antibody cloning, we acquired three pairs of IgG VHs and VLs inserted expression plasmids. Finally, we expressed these paired plasmids encoding IgG VH and VL sequences and named these three mAbs as 311mab-31B5, 311mab-32D4 and 311mab-31B9, respectively. We first examined whether these human mAbs were able to bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein by ELISA. The results showed that all three mAbs strongly and specifically bind to the RBD protein (Fig. 1f ). Next, we tested whether these mAbs can block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2. We found that both 311mab-31B5 and 311mab-32D4 could efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 RBD-hACE2 interaction (IC 50 = 0.0332, and 0.0450 \u03bcg/ml, respectively), while 311mab-31B9 clone failed to inhibit such an interaction (Fig. 1g) . The 31B5-and 32D4mediated inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction was also evidenced by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1h, i) . Furthermore, we determined the neutralization of these three mAbs using a SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped lentiviral particle. 22 In line with ELISAand flow cytometry-based blockade results, both 311mab-31B5 and 311mab-32D4 effectively neutralized pseudovirus entry to host cells ectopically expressing hACE2 (IC 50 = 0.0338, and 0.0698 \u03bcg/ml, respectively). As expected, 311mab-31B9 clone failed to show any neutralization activities (Fig. 1j) .",
