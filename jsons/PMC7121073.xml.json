Setting meaningful targets is a first step toward improving the effectiveness of an HIV/AIDS response, including the health system itself, as well as new interventions and programs. A crucial second step is establishing indicators, also sometimes called metrics or benchmarks, for the purpose of assessing progress (or lack thereof) toward the selected targets. Best practice is to construct these indicators within the so-called \u201cSMART\u201d format (Doran 1981), ensuring the indicators are:\nSpecific: detailed and explicit, avoiding overly general aspects, and logically linked with the given objective\nMeasurable: capable of objective assessment in a manner that is consistently repeatable, comparable, and auditable\nAttainable: achievable in the sense that the target can be met, but difficult enough such that the indicator is meaningful\nRelevant: logically linked to the objective as well as resulting in information that is actionable\nTime-bound: having predictable, repeated timelines for assessment\n",

Availability indicators primarily examine health service or intervention delivery or offering to target populations and must be tailored to the unique context of each delivery modality. For example, availability of condoms in vending machines, at pharmacies, at community-based organizations, or from outreach workers must be measured differently. Coverage indicators measure the extent to which a target population is actually provided with a particular health service or intervention. These kinds of indicators can prove challenging, since an accurate measure requires a carefully estimated total target population for its denominator. Furthermore, frequency of contact\u2014either successfully reaching a target individual or a target individual successfully accessing a service\u2014is an important factor in assessing coverage for some types of health services. Quality indicators cover a broad range of measures including the scope and completeness of interventions or programs, their effectiveness and efficiency, and their safety profile. Although often challenging to measure, best practice for quality indicators is measurement of performance in these categories against standards set by independent, international organizations. Impact indicators primarily include disease incidence and prevalence, measurable by traditional epidemiological tools and mathematical modelling, but may also include prevalence of disease risk behaviors (e.g., sharing of drug-injecting equipment, consistent condom use; World Health Organization et al. 2009).",

Called the \u201cThree Ones,\u201d these principles were one, agreed-upon framework for coordinating all partners, one national coordinating authority with support from multiple sectors, and one comprehensive, country-level monitoring and evaluation system (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 2004). Achievement of the third of the \u201cThree Ones\u201d principles was expected, at the time, to be a significant challenge\u2014countries\u2019 HIV M&E systems needed to meet the needs of the global community engaged in fighting HIV/AIDS, national and subnational stakeholders from multiple sectors, public health workers coordinating efforts \u201con the ground,\u201d and funding agencies, both domestic and international, looking to examine the returns on their investments. Furthermore, these M&E systems needed to be built, tested, and launched quickly, yet be robust enough to achieve their purpose, and at the same time be flexible, scalable, and adjustable so that they could meet the needs of the future as well. It was in this context that China embarked on its journey toward developing an M&E system for its HIV response.",

Furthermore, the importance of tying indicators to performance was not mentioned among official China CDC documents, perhaps because China\u2019s efforts toward curbing the HIV epidemic were too new to detect change. However, there were subtle hints that China\u2019s HIV programs would be judged by their impact and that stakeholders would be held accountable for generating success. For example, in a directive on HIV/AIDS in 2003, Premier Wen Jiabao stated (Shen and Yu 2005):\nA responsibility system, strategic planning, monitoring and supervision, capacity building of professional teams, technical measures and management by laws must be strengthened. Meanwhile, successful experiences should be summarized. Only in this way can we realize the true objective of HIV prevention and control, which is relevant to the fundamental interests of the people.\n\n",

Over a 10-year engagement, from 2004 to 2014, the Global Fund appropriated over 320 million USD to HIV response activities in China. Although the Global Fund was ready to begin deploying funds as early as 2002, China was not ready, both politically and ideologically, to meet the Global Fund\u2019s requirements for transparency, inclusiveness, destigmatization, and community (i.e., civil society) participation (Huang and Ping 2014). Before 2003, China was largely in denial of its HIV epidemic, and societal stigma and discrimination against PLWH and their families was common and severe (Huang 2005). Participation of civil society in the fight against HIV/AIDS was minimal at this time, and Chinese Government power was substantial and focused on suppressing behaviors deemed undesirable. Not surprisingly, harm reduction was still very controversial in China during this time\u2014giving condoms to sex workers or offering clean needles to drug users was viewed as supporting illegal activity. Thus, China CDC\u2019s first application to the Global Fund in 2002, for grants to support HIV prevention programs for drug users, was rejected partly because it lacked a harm reduction component (Huang and Ping 2014).",

Additionally, China tackled the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus quickly and effectively in 2003, which gave the international community new confidence in China\u2019s public health response capabilities. And finally, China\u2019s eagerness to compete for, and win, Global Fund grants to help with the costs associated with implementing and scaling up a range of initiatives also contributed to major changes in the way it was willing to conduct its HIV response efforts (Minghui et al. 2015).
