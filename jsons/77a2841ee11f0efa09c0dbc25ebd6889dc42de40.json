            "text": "In the politically sensitive year of 1997, Hong Kong experienced an outbreak of avian flu when the deadly H5N1 virus unprecedentedly jumped the species barrier from chickens and infected human beings. Hong Kong decided to slaughter over a million chickens, and the virus was stopped in its tracks. In 2003, Hong Kong was the epicenter of the SARS pandemic, which originated in Guangdong province. The Faculty of Medicine played key roles in both instances, with its Microbiology Department successfully identifying a novel coronavirus as being responsible for SARS. Hong Kong learned from its experience and took action to combat the emergence of new infectious diseases. Such vigilance paid off in 2009, when swine flu swept the world, and in 2013, when a novel avian flu H7N9 emerged in China. On May 9, 1997, a three-year-old boy, Lam Hoi-ka, fell ill. He had a sore throat and a fever. When he hadn't recovered after five days, he was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where he died on May 21. The cause of death was noted as acute respiratory failure, liver and kidney failure and \"disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.\" In effect, his blood had curdled. 3",

Make sure agriculture was involved. Dr. Margaret Chan was clearly overseeing everything.\" 19 Shortridge himself felt subsequent events justified the cull. \"The last human case of H5N1 disease was recognized the day before the commencement of the slaughter on 29 December, vindicating the controversial slaughter policy,\" he wrote. \"It is reasonable to believe that this intervention prevented an incipient pandemic progressing to an actual pandemic and thus a pandemic was averted. The H5N1/97 virus was possibly one or two mutational events from achieving pandemicity. However, as with all measures that successfully prevent an adverse outcome there is no definite way of proving their efficacy.\" 20 The unusual clinical severity and high mortality of infected patients in the outbreak of avian influenza H5N1 in Hong Kong was first reported in the Lancet in February 1998 by Yuen Kwok-yung (K.Y. Yuen) of Hong Kong University's Department of Microbiology. He was the lead writer, whose co-authors included K.F. Shortridge and Malik Peiris. 21 Yuen had attended to H5N1 patients and devised a rapid diagnostic test known as RT-PCR used in testing the respiratory secretions from these patients. This was the first time that the test was used for rapid diagnosis of such patients in a clinical setting. He also analyzed the case notes of 12 patients, ranging in age from 1 to 60. \"Whether avian viruses can infect human beings directly or need to reassort in an intermediate host (e.g., pigs) is a matter of debate,\" he wrote, adding: \"Until recently, a purely avian virus had not been isolated from people with respiratory disease, although conjunctivitis caused by an avian H7 virus has been reported.\"",

However, the precursor viruses remained, including the H5N1-like virus in the Guangdong goose identified in 1996 and other viruses in quails. Live chickens continued to be sold in Hong Kong but the government after 1997 instituted a policy of central slaughter of geese and ducks. For three years, Hong Kong's retail markets remained free of the H5N1 virus. 22 But in 2001, the H5N1 virus was back. On April 11, the government announced that it had isolated Goose/96-like H5N1 virus from a chicken cage in the poultry stall of a market, but suggested that this mild type of virus would not pose a major threat to public health. However, the surveillance program of the university detected a new strain of H5N1 virus and the sample was confirmed by the World Health Organization as having the potential to be highly pathogenic. 23 The viruses were initially detected in apparently healthy chickens but, not long afterward, the chickens began dying in one market after another, although there were no human victims. Professor K.Y. Yuen, who had been Chair of Infectious Diseases since 1999 and was a member of the consultation committee of the Health and Welfare Bureau, held detailed discussions with Lily Yam, Secretary for Environment and Food, on measures to deal with the outbreak (Fig. 14.2) . He fully supported her decision to make a pre-emptive move and slaughter more than a million chickens, ducks and geese to prevent further reassortments, possibly into pathogens that can threaten people. The influenza research team, established after the H5N1 outbreak in 1997, was led by Professor Shortridge and included Dr. Malik Peiris and Dr. Guan Yi, as well as ten local research assistants, all of whom worked closely with the government to identify new influenza viruses and stop them before they could infect humans. The team also cooperated with the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Institute of Health and other international health bodies. 24 Yam explained that the slaughter was ordered \"to avoid the possibility, no matter how remote, of this particular strain combining to form a new strain that may affect human beings.\" K.Y. Yuen proposed a monthly rest day for retail markets, when all unsold poultry would be killed and the markets cleaned, left empty for the day, then restocked the following day. The measure was adopted by the government.",

No announcements were made either by Beijing or by local authorities in Guangdong Province. However, the controlled media did, at times, publish articles from which some information could be gleaned. Thus, Guangdong newspapers in early January 2003 published a handful of articles denying the existence of any epidemic but, by doing so, enhanced speculation of a deadly new disease. On January 4 an article appeared in Heyuan Daily headlined \"Epidemic is only a rumor.\" In Guangzhou, News Express ran an article \"No reason to worry\" on January 10 and \"Heyuan back to normal\" on January 14. 26 Such articles were meant to reassure the public that the situation was under control and that there was nothing to worry about. But the articles themselves were not that reassuring. Thus, the Heyuan Daily article described panic buying of drugs, with long lines at pharmacies. It said that the \"terrifying rumor of a serious infectious disease\" had resulted in a rush to purchase certain antiviral tonics. \"This irrational purchasing has driven prices of these drugs to ridiculous levels: a tonic that usually costs 10 yuan now costs 450 yuan. Antibiotics have also become more expensive, the price rising to 30 yuan. Yet no matter the price, as of 9 p.m., these medicines were sold out at most pharmacies. Until yesterday morning there were long lines waiting to buy these drugs with customers purchasing up to 10 boxes each.\"",

This disease is not infectious and is caused by changing weather. The symptoms are high fever, coughing and spots in the lungs. This disease is not similar to any communicable disease identified by the government so there has been no reason to report it to provincial authorities.\" So it seemed that Heyuan was not able to look after its own patients and had to send them to other cities, and had to seek help from specialists in Guangzhou.

However, because no one with sufficient security clearance was there, the document, which contained information about a new pneumonia-like illness spreading in the region, lay unread for three days. Eventually, a bulletin was sent to hospitals across the province, but by then many health workers were on vacation because of holidays to celebrate the Chinese New Year, which fell on Saturday, February 1. 29 The Chinese public, and the rest of the world, was kept in ignorance. Under Chinese law, any occurrence of infectious diseases should be classified as a state secret before they are \"announced by the Ministry of Health or organs authorized by the Ministry.\" That is to say, until the government made the information public, any doctor or journalist who disclosed information on the disease was liable to prosecution for leaking state secrets. 30 On February 8, reports about a \"deadly flu\" began to be sent via text messages on mobile phones in Guangzhou. In the evening, words like bird flu and anthrax started to appear on some local Internet sites. 31 day, two major Guangzhou newspapers, the Nanfang Daily and the Yangcheng Wanbao, carried short news reports about a \"mysterious illness\" that had hit the hospitals in Guangzhou. 32 The next day, February 9, a delegation of experts from the Ministry of Health and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), led by the Vice Minister of Health and the Deputy Director-General of Health, went to Guangdong. 33 On February 10, a circular appeared in the local media that acknowledged the presence of the disease and listed some preventive measures, including improving ventilation, using vinegar fumes to disinfect the air, and washing hands frequently. Responding to the advice, residents in Guangzhou and other cities cleared pharmacy shelves of antibiotics and flu medication. In some cities, even white vinegar was sold out. The panic spread quickly in Guangdong, and was also felt in other provinces. 34 The information blackout imposed by the mainland meant that the health authorities in Hong Kong were kept in ignorance of what was going on in neighboring Guangdong. It wasn't until February 10, 2003, when six newspapers in Hong Kong carried reports on the atypical pneumonia outbreak that Hong Kong's Director of Health, Dr. Margaret Chan, and Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, became aware of the epidemic next door. It was also on February 10 that the WHO country office in Beijing received an email message describing a \"strange contagious disease\" that had \"already left more than 100 people dead in Guangdong Province in the space of one week.\" 35 The Global Public Health Intelligence Network of the WHO also picked up media reports of an unusual epidemic of fatal pneumonia-like illness in Guangdong.",

At the meeting, Guan Yi expressed his concern that the atypical pneumonia outbreak in Guangdong might be linked with H5N1 influenza, as had happened in Hong Kong in 1997 (Fig. 14.4) . He proposed a more in-depth field investigation to ascertain the infectious agents responsible for the outbreak by conducting a foray into Guangzhou to find out what was actually going on and, if possible, to bring back specimens from patients suffering from this mysterious ailment for analysis in Hong Kong. The consensus at that meeting was that Dr. Guan and Dr. Zheng should try to contact authorities in Guangzhou to facilitate the investigation 38 (Fig. 14.5). As Peiris said, \"We knew the disease was going to come over to Hong Kong,\" so it was vital to learn as much as possible before it arrived. 39 Guan and Zheng were both from the mainland and knew its culture and its people. So, when a mysterious disease was reported in Guangdong, it was natural that they were the ones to plunge deep into the heart of the infected areas and to shine a light into the dark corners. They left the following day, February 11. Peiris's role was to supervise the virological investigations into the patient specimens. He would also liaise with researchers in other countries.

Some sense of what happened is provided by this account: \"She [the nurse] elevated the back of the man's bed, removed his oxygen mask, and ordered him to open his mouth. Tentatively reaching a wooden stick with a Q-tip-like bulb at the end into the oral cavity, the nurse dabbed at the patient's tongue twice, removed the swab, and handed it to Guan Yi. He broke the top of the stick and dropped the swab into a vial of medium. He didn't say anything, but he could already see that this wasn't going to work. In order for it to be an effective screening, he would need mucus and phlegm from further down the patient's throat, as well as some nasal aspiration. The nurse was too frightened to gather anything but the faintest of saliva samples.\" 41 Guan Yi decided to take over and so, at the next station, he asked the nurse to step aside as he held a female patient up, ordering her to open her mouth, and then began slapping her back gently to encourage her to expectorate mucus. \"This time the swab was pressed so far down the patient's throat that when Guan removed it, it was coated with a satisfactory blob of mucus that glistened under the white lights. He managed to take twelve swabs, each of which he sealed in a vial of suspension medium so that they appeared almost like miniature moth cocoons preserved in formaldehyde.\"",

He also instructed ICU staff to put on N95 surgical masks, gloves and gowns when caring for this patient. 47 Dr. Watt also asked ICU staff to take Tamiflu as a precautionary measure. 48 On February 24, there was an unexpected telephone call from Guangzhou.

It recommended that \"patients with atypical pneumonia who may be related to these outbreaks be isolated with barrier nursing techniques.\" At the same time, WHO also recommended that \"any suspect cases be reported to national health authorities.\" Three days later, it issued a rare emergency travel advisory calling the disease \"a worldwide health threat.\" It also gave the mystery ailment a name, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). For the Special Administrative Region, it was an unfortunate choice of names, tarnishing the image of Hong Kong at best and, at worst, suggesting that the disease and Hong Kong were somehow synonymous. Hong Kong suggested a name change to the WHO but eventually gave up such efforts. On March 16, WHO released a list of \"affected areas\" with local transmission of SARS. Hong Kong was on that list.

Soon, Imperial College and HKU scholars were writing papers together. One early paper, whose principal researchers were Anderson and Christl A. Donnelly, also of Imperial College, was somewhat controversial, asserting that the case fatality rate was significantly higher than health authorities had thought, possibly up to 55% in people 60 and above, and 13.2% in younger people. As The New York Times reported, this was the first major epidemiological study of the disease. 55 The paper's authors included seven Imperial College experts, seven specialists from the Department of Community Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, two from the Hong Kong Department of Health, two from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority and one from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. They explained that estimating fatality rates by simply \"dividing the current cumulative number of deaths by the current cumulative number of hospital admissions\" was not satisfactory because \"among patients still recorded as being in hospital, it is impossible to ascertain who will eventually die or be discharged.\" 56 Because of the public health importance of the article, the Lancet posted it online on May 7, 2003, more than two weeks before it appeared in the journal itself.",

But, with SARS, \"the incubation period from infection to first fever is five days, the time from infection to peak infectiousness is about 18 days, so you had a long interval and if you isolated or quarantined that patient you could stop transmission dead.\" 58 That, he said, was essentially what was done since Roman times with ships arriving at ports, and \"sailors were put in quarantine until they were certain that they were not transmitting anything obnoxious from their travels.\"",

The laboratories were in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the 57 Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States and, of course, Hong Kong. All were approached by telephone during the weekend of March 15-16 and all agreed to participate and to observe the WHO's ground rules. The purpose of the network was to unite laboratories with different methods and capacities to rapidly fulfill all postulates for establishing a virus as the cause of the disease. Scientists agreed to share results in real time via a secure website and discuss findings in daily conferences. 59 As Klaus Stohr wrote, \"Laboratories in the influenza network ruled out all influenza virus strains and other known causes of pneumonia from samples taken in Hanoi, Singapore and Hong Kong. SARS looked increasingly like a new disease.\" 60 Of the 11 laboratories, three were in Hong Kong. These belonged to the Hong Kong Government, the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. At Hong Kong University, the team included medical technologist Chan Kwok-hung, pathologist John Nicholls and Leo Poon Lit-man. The Hong Kong University virology lab was the smallest, with only about six people, easily dwarfed by the government's virology lab, not to say the U.S. CDC's lab, where hundreds of people worked. In other words, the odds were stacked against Malik's team in the race to identify the SARS virus. Dr. Chan set up cell lines for the testing of specimens, Dr. Poon helped develop molecular diagnostic tools for fishing out unknown pathogens, and Dr. Nicholls (Fig. 14.9 ) used electron microscopy to help identify viruses. K.Y. Yuen did PCR tests on the positive cell culture with cytopathic effect to exclude the presence or contamination by any bacteria that may cause atypical pneumonia, including chlamydia and mycoplasma.",

What we needed next were luck and lots of patience.\" 67 63 SARS: How a Global Epidemic Was Stopped,\" 2006. 64 Abraham, Twenty-First Century Plague, 123-24. 65 Yuen and Peiris, \"Facing the Unknowns of SARS in Hong Kong.\" 176. 66 Ibid. 67 Ibid, 179. Dr. Chan decided to use a cell line of fetal kidney cells from rhesus monkeys. It was rarely used except to grow hepatitis A virus but it had also proved useful in growing a range of respiratory viruses. 68 This was done on March 13. Two days later, there was a visible reaction as the cells appeared to be dying, that is to say, there was a virus taking over. This was confirmed through multiple tests that eliminated the possibility of contamination. \"The use of this cell line (FRhk-4) was probably the most important decision in the discovery of the pathogen behind SARS,\" Yuen and Peiris wrote. \"The lung tissue of Mr. Chan YP (the brother--in-law of the index patient) was inoculated into this cell line for viral culture together with other specimens from patients with pneumonia associated with recent travel to Guangdong. Miraculously, significant changes were observed in this cell line.\" 69 But was the virus that was killing the cells the SARS virus, that is, was it the cause of the disease, or did it just happen to be present? To determine this, the Hong Kong University team tested their virus against blood serum samples from patients at different stages of the disease, from early onset to the late stages. The test results confirmed their suspicions. As Peiris said, \"We had the virus growing well, it was reacting in the expected way to early and late serum samples. We were quite sure this was the virus causing SARS.\" 70 By March 21, Peiris was ready to share his findings with researchers around the world. That day, he had missed the daily conference call linking SARS researchers globally. But, in an email late that night, Peiris indicated that Hong Kong University had isolated an agent from two patients with SARS. The agent was isolated in continuous rhesus monkey kidney cells. It had a cytopathogenic effect, that is to say, it caused structural changes in host cells, which indicated the growth of a virus. \"In conclusion,\" Malik wrote, \"we are confident that the agent in the cell cultures are associated with the SARS syndrome. The identification of this agent is under way.\" 71 Klaus St\u00f6hr of the WHO subsequently published a paper on the \"multicenter collaboration to investigate the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" in which he recalled Malik Peiris' report on the agent that had been cultured in rhesus monkey kidney cells. \"In addition, in an immunofluorescence assay of virus-infected cells, done in a blinded trial, sera from SARS patients had rising antibody titres to the new virus isolate,\" he wrote. \"By contrast, sera from blood donors taken long before the disease emerged in Hong Kong had no antibody to this virus. Furthermore, virus-like particles in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrance were seen in thin electron microscopic sections from infected cells.\" Stohr concluded: \"These findings proved to be the turning point in the search for the SARS causative agent.

In one test, the clinical response of patients with SARS to a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin was examined and compared with patients treated with ribavirin only who served as historical controls. The treatment was found to be significantly more effective than that provided in the historical control group. 81 Just about this time, Hong Kong received a rare visit from a Chinese leader. Premier Wen Jiabao visited the city in mid-2003, the first national leader to do so since the devastation of SARS.

Yuen, the Chief of Virology Professor Malik Peiris, and virologist at the Department of Microbiology, Dr. Guan Yi. The Premier was briefed by Professor Yuen on how, despite limited resources, the university was able to track down the agent of SARS while Dr. Guan explained how animal viruses were discovered. 82 Within weeks of the discovery of the SARS coronavirus, the viral genome had been completely sequenced, with Hong Kong University coming third in that race, following researchers in Canada and the United States. The sequencing showed a virus that had begun life in an animal before it mutated and began to infect people. animal-or animals-carried the virus that mutated and was able to infect people?

            "text": "As it turned out, because of Guan Yi's efforts, not only was an animal link to the SARS virus uncovered but another SARS outbreak in Guangdong was narrowly averted. On December 27, 2003, a suspected human case of SARS was reported in Guangzhou and the patient was quarantined. The Center of Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong confirmed the case as SARS. The viral genomic sequence from this new SARS case was almost identical to that from palm civets, suggesting that the human patient might have acquired the infection from palm civets or other wild animals in the wet markets in Guangdong. 87 So great was the danger of another SARS outbreak in Guangdong among the human population that Guan Yi decided to appeal directly to the powers that be. As the year 2004 began, he sat down and wrote a letter to China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, copies of which were also sent to the Ministry of Health and China's Centers for Disease Control. \"With winter coming, the wildlife markets have reopened, providing the perfect conditions for another outbreak of SARS,\" he wrote. He listed his findings on the civet cat as a major carrier of the SARS coronavirus, as well as the fact that other wild animals, too, carry the virus. He enclosed four pages of genetic sequences taken from civets. The letter was hand delivered on January 2. 88 The very next day, he was invited to Guangzhou to make his case in front of the most eminent scientists in the province, including Professor Zhong Nanshan, and clinicians who had treated patients during the SARS outbreak the previous year. While they were speaking, the amino-acid sequences of the human patient recover- ing from SARS in a Guangzhou hospital were sent to Hong Kong for sequencing. In an hour, the results were in: the SARS patient's virus sequences were almost identical to that of the virus sequences of the palm civets. That is to say, the virus in the wild animal markets had somehow infected a human. The group decided then and there to contact the provincial governor and recommend a cull of all civet cats. Professor Zhong telephoned Governor Huang Huahua recommending the slaughtering of all civet cats in the markets. 89 The order to carry out the slaughter was given on January 5, 2004, involving an estimated total of 10,000 civet cats.",

Yuen said that while research the previous spring had shown that the SARS virus that infected more than 8,000 people around the world was genetically very similar to a virus in civet cats, new research shows that the virus in civet cats \"has mutated to form a new 'sublineage' of the virus.\" He said that a genetic sequencing of samples from the infected man in Guangzhou had found that the main \"spike\" of protein was exactly identical, down to the last amino acid, to the new sublineage of the virus found in civet cats. Professor Zhong warned that civet cat feces could dry up and become windblown dust that would raise a risk of airborne infection. He said the feces carry extremely high concentrations of the virus, which can still be detected even when the feces are diluted as much as one billion times. Professor Yuen's conviction of the role of civet cats in the transmission of the SARS virus to humans was reflected in testimony he gave in early January 2004 to the Legislative Council Select Committee set up to inquire into the handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak by the Government and the Hospital Authority. At one point, Legislator Chan Kwok-keung (\u9673\u570b\u5f37) asked about the origin of the virus and this exchange took place:",

After that, no new cases of SARS emerged, despite the Chinese New Year which, as usual, saw large numbers of people traveling as they returned home for the holidays. Thus, the January 2004 cull in Guangdong, like that of December 1997 in Hong Kong, must be deemed a success in averting a pandemic. However, farmers of civet cats suffered economic disaster. Researchers found that civets on farms were largely free from the virus, though those in overcrowded retail markets, where civets are put in close proximity with other species, are often infected. This raised the question whether the civet cat was the main conduit for SARS or whether it was infected by another animal, which was the real reservoir of the virus.

He found that the Chinese horseshoe bat was the natural reservoir of SARS coronavirus-like viruses. So the bats might well have infected civet cats, possibly via yet a third animal. 91 The public health implication was that animals, such as bats, should not be mixed together with other species in wildlife markets, as was the case before 2003. The Microbiology Department did not stop there. It went on to sample animals for novel viruses and, by 2017, had identified 60 novel animal viruses. Most of them were named after Hong Kong or after Hong Kong University, such as the bat coronavirus HKU4 found in Lesser Bamboo bat and the bat coronavirus HKU5 found in the Japanese Pipistrellus bat. Not much notice was taken of these novel viruses but, after the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, both were mentioned in a paper about a man who died in Saudi Arabia. \"A previously unknown coronavirus was isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man who presented with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure with fatal outcome in Saudi Arabia,\" began an article in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2012. \"The virus (called HCov-EMC, later MERS-CoV) replicated readily in cell culture, producing cytopathic effects of rounding, detachment, and syncytium formation.

In March 2009, there was an outbreak of \"flu\" in a town called La Gloria in Veracruz, Mexico. It affected 60% of the town's population and killed three children. It was believed to be the \"common flu.\" Between 14th and 17th April, specimens collected from two children with flu in California, U.S.A., were shown to have a strain of \"swine flu\" called H1N1. On April 24, the World Health Organization issued a disease outbreak notice confirming the infection of a number of people in Mexico and the United States by swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses not previously detected in pigs or humans. The 24th was a Friday and Malik heard the news Friday night. He gathered the \"flu team\" for a meeting the next day when they discussed what steps to take. A priority was to set up diagnostic tests for detecting the virus when it arrived in Hong Kong, as it inevitably would. They had the sequence of the virus provided by the U.S. CDC but for such molecular detection tests a positive control virus is needed to establish that the test is working properly. The new pandemic H1N1 virus was not available in Hong Kong. But a decade-long surveillance of swine influenza viruses provided a source within which to search and, indeed, a virus close enough to serve as the positive control was found. The next question was to understand the origins of the virus. It was decided to start genetic sequencing of the many hundreds of swine influenza viruses available from this surveillance effort.",

On 26 April, Hong Kong raised its alertness level from \"alert\" to \"serious,\" just one step away from \"emergency.\" The next day, the World Health Organization, too, raised its alertness level. Dr. Keiji Fukuda, WHO's Assistant Director-General, explained that the increase in pandemic alert level was in response to the outbreak of swine flu that had originated in Mexico, but that it did not mean that a pandemic was \"inevitable.\" 102 Hong Kong also made swine flu a notifiable disease, a step it learned from its SARS experience. \"Actually, we had a number of research grants for pandemic preparedness,\" recalls Professor Benjamin J. Cowling, Head of Epidemiology Biostatics in the School of Public Health. \"This allowed us to scale up for research into the pandemic, so when the pandemic actually came here, we did a number of studies which were the envy of most other places in the world\" 103 (Fig. 14.13) .",

Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans.\" 107 The paper was submitted to the journal Nature for publication on 24 May 2009; it was accepted 4 June and was published online 11 June 2009.

A study of the lineage of the H1N1/2009 viruses showed that three major lineages of swine H1 influenza viruses had been prevalent in pigs in surveys conducted in Hong Kong over the past 10 years. The H1N1 flu virus was a triple reassortant, combining the classical swine H1N1, the European \"avian-like\" H1N1 and triple-reassortant H1N2 (TRIG) viruses. And while the virus had jumped from pigs into humans, actually this had happened more than once. \"After circulating in humans for some time they jumped back to pigs and tried to reassort with other pig virus,\" reported Professor Leo Poon, a diagnostic expert in identifying viruses. \"That was quite interesting because it highlights the pig as a major reservoir, or intermediate host.\" 109",

It is therefore important that surveillance in swine is greatly heightened and that all eight gene segments are genetically characterized so that such reassortment events are rapidly identified.\" 110 Observations made over 14 years of pigs in a Hong Kong abattoir were able to show that all major lineages of swine viruses of North American or European origin were present in Chinese pigs from different provinces shipped to Hong Kong for slaughter. Although pigs, unlike birds, don't fly, they are exported from one country to another, often for breeding purposes. So, although the 2009 epidemic did not emerge in China but in Mexico, analysis of pigs in China was able to show how the mixing of viruses was occurring. 111 Peiris and his colleagues argued that similar events probably had also occurred, undetected, in Mexico. Indeed, they were right, but it took another 5 years to find these viruses in Mexico. So great was Hong Kong's input that, in 2010-11, it contributed half of all the known swine influenza genetic data in the world. The diversity of genetic variants found in the studies by the Hong Kong group also allowed them to understand the genetic determinants that allowed a human transmissible virus to emerge from these precursor swine viruses. 112 According to Cowling, when there is a new influenza virus, the three immediate priorities of public health officials are to determine, first, how quickly it spreads between people, how severe the infections are, and what the options are for controlling it, that is, what can be done and the potential for success of such efforts. \"The research that we did here covered all three of those important areas,\" he said, whereas other research groups or government ministries are usually unable to do that.",

During that period, H1N1 infection was a reportable disease, so the data collected was likely to be comprehensive. The information included demographic date on age and sex, clinical information including illness-onset date, laboratory-confirmation date and hospital-admission date. The researchers found that the estimated reproduction number of pandemic H1N1 appeared to be lower in Hong Kong than in other countries. The hospital admission rate in Hong Kong was high due to broader admission criteria, \"with young children and pregnant women routinely admitted for testing and investigation.\" 116 While the overall number of severe hospital cases was not high, Professor K.Y. Yuen found that for severe cases, the viral load in the respiratory tract didn't decrease rapidly despite oseltamivir treatment. This led him and his associates to try another method: they selected mildly infected patients with a high level of neu-tralizing antibody and used the convalescent plasma of these patients to treat those severely ill. Yuen found that the treatment of severe A influenza (H1N1) within 5 days of symptom onset was associated with a lower viral load and reduced mortality. 117 The mortality in severely ill patients treated by convalescent plasma was 20% whereas those treated by Tamiflu alone was 54.8%. 118",

Working together with the Hong Kong Red Cross, researchers tested 14,766 blood samples from blood donors during the period when the virus was active. They discovered that almost half of all schoolage children in Hong Kong were infected during the first wave. However, because the symptoms were mild, few of them went to hospital. Paradoxically, a much smaller percentage of older adults aged 50-59 years were infected, but a much higher percentage went to hospital. If it wasn't for the serological tests, such a phenomenon may have gone undetected and the disease may have been thought to be one that primarily attacked older people. 120 Wu and his team also measured the impact of school closures on the mitigation of the H1N1 pandemic. They concluded that the closure of secondary schools for the summer vacation \"was associated with substantially lower transmission across age groups,\" and estimated that reporting of cases \"declined to 5.2% of its initial rate through the second half of June.\" By comparison, attack rates in previous epidemics have generally been highest in younger children, and this was true in Mexico and Chicago. This finding, they reported, \"intuitively implies that closures were effective in preventing infections in this age group\" 121 ( Fig. 14.15 ).",

Then two sons also developed quite severe pneumonia. This was scarily reminiscent of the SARS epidemic a decade previously. While they tested negative for SARS, it turned out that they had influenza, but a hitherto unknown kind of flu, H7N9. The Chinese authorities responded quickly by establishing a joint multi-sectoral coordination mechanism, initiating several investigations, notifying the World Health Organization, sharing viruses with WHO's influenza collaborating centers and other laboratories and mounting effective counter measures such as closure of live poultry markets in some locations. Subsequently, WHO undertook a six-day joint mission to China. 123 Malik Peiris was part of the mission. Live bird markets were an immediate suspect. Even though some people refused to believe that the virus came from chickens, Shanghai closed all live bird markets and human infections disappeared. That made it quite clear that the retail poultry market was the cause. China CDC did a lot of work, but encountered opposition from those involved in the poultry trade and in agriculture. Because the poultry didn't sicken, farmers weren't too concerned about whether they were infected or not. And while closing live markets was effective in combating the virus, it was also extremely costly.",

That was one less thing to worry about. But the main concern was the infectivity and transmissibility of this new virus. A group of scholars from the University of Hong Kong and from Shantou University, plus international and mainland Chinese experts, published an article in Science magazine. 126 These scholars conducted experiments on ferrets, which are considered the primary mammalian model for human influenza. While healthy ferrets inoculated with the virus displayed a brief fever one or two days after inoculation, with \"robust sneezing and nasal discharge,\" and three ferrets placed in direct contact with the inoculated group displayed similar symptoms, only one of three airborne-exposed ferrets displayed such symptoms, suggesting that transmission by air was much less efficient. Though the paper was formally published 12 July 2013, it was submitted April 30, accepted May 20 and published online May 23. \"We were,\" Guan Yi said, \"the first team in the whole world to publish such a paper to define virus infectivity and transmissibility.\" 127 Another paper in the Lancet showed that H7N9 was much more efficient at infecting the human 125 bronchus than H5N1 so that the chance of getting infected and potentially transmitting it to others was higher. 128 Still, the question was, where did this new virus come from? The answer, like that for H5N1, was poultry. \"China has the largest poultry population in the world,\" Guan Yi observes. \"Domestic duck is the natural host of influenza virus, and 70% of domestic ducks in the world are in China. Likewise, 90% of domestic geese are in China.\" At the time, it wasn't clear which animal was the host to the virus, so Guan and his key associate Huachen Zhu, also known as Maria, sampled all major poultry from markets. \"We pinpointed chicken as the source,\" Guan said. Surprisingly, the virus was in the respiratory tract, not the digestive tract. Some people, Zhu and Guan said, offered the pigeon as a possible suspect, because the pigeon population is relatively small and the economic impact of its obliteration would be less damaging, but they showed beyond doubt that the chicken was the culprit. While the paper did not appear until the 10 October 2013 issue of Nature-and even the online edition wasn't published until 21 August, it was submitted on May 22, less than two months after the discovery of H7N9 and at a time when China's ministry of agriculture was arguing strongly that chickens were not the source.",

However, their data showed that, for this gene, more closely related H11N9 and H2N9 viruses were found in migratory wild birds in Hong Kong in 2010-11. The authors concluded: \"Domestic ducks seem to act as key intermediate hosts by influenza viruses from migratory birds, by facilitating the generation of different combinations of H7 and N9 or N7 subtype viruses, and by transmitting these viruses to chickens. After transmission, reassortment with enzootic H9N2 viruses formed the current H7N9 or H7N7 viruses seen in chickens. This probably led to outbreaks in chickens, resulting in the rapid spread of the novel reassortant H7N9 lineage through live poultry markets (LPMs), which then became the source of human infections. The cessation of human infections after the closure of LPMs, after a precedent set during the Hong Kong H5N1 'bird flu' incident in 1997, strongly supports this proposition.\" So the virus went from wild birds to domestic ducks to chickens, before infecting humans.",

Separation of live ducks and geese from chickens can also reduce the risk of intermingling of different forms of viruses.

This further confirmed the link between H7N9 in humans and H7N9 in poultry. 134 A review article was published in the Lancet comparing H5N1 bird flu in Hong Kong in 1997 and H7N9 in Shanghai 16 years later. Crossing the species barrier from bird to human was previously unknown to medical history.

Modern outbreaks are combinations of disease and anxiety, disruption; when you have something like SARS, there is a huge amount of anxiety. In Beijing there was a day when there was virtually no car traffic at all, the entire city was at a standstill-that was not disease. That was fear of the disease.\" 144 He continued: \"I think if we look back in history, in the 1918 epidemic, we can see where fear and actual disease are commensurate; 40-50 million people died around the world, like Black Plague in the Middle Ages. But with SARS and bird flu, we're not talking about millions of people dying and yet we're talking about that level of fear, almost paralysis. Managing the disease aspect is relatively easier than managing the fear aspect.\"",

But he traced the root of the problem to people, not birds, saying: \"The industrialization of poultry is the nub of this problem. We have unnaturally brought to our doorstep pandemic-capable viruses. We have given them the opportunity to infect and destroy huge numbers of birds and \u2026 jump into the human race.\" He went on: \"Something is not right. Human population has exploded, we are impinging on the realms of the animals more and more, taking their habitats for ourselves, forcing animals into ever more artificial environments and existences.\"",

Besides, infectious disease expertise has undergone a major transformation in the last two decades. When bird flu struck Hong Kong in 1997, the territory was dependent on external expertise to cope with that disease. Over the intervening years, researchers at Hong Kong University have become leading global experts in their own right. The lessons of bird flu and SARS have been well and truly learned. Hong Kong has grown and matured through those difficult days. Its research-based control efforts benefit the nation and the global community. As Angus Nicoll has observed, Hong Kong does fast as well as high quality research and does excellent epidemiological work, from which the rest of the world can benefit. 144 Interview with Fukuda. 145 ",
