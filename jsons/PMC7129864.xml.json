A recent American medical education reform initiative emphasizes the integration of basic science and clinical courses to enhance correlation and continuum of courses. The problem-based curriculum utilizes clinical scenarios with emphasis on problem solving. Each session of discussion is based on a patient's clinical records and involves integration of basic science knowledge and clinical management. The National University of Taiwan was the first university in Taiwan to introduce the problem-based curriculum into its own curriculum in 1990 and other universities subsequently followed. The integrated courses are either based on organ systems or a patient's clinical problem. In addition, medical education on ethics and humanity has also gained importance in our country, with implementation of courses to explore related issues such as euthanasia and surrogate mothers [2], [4].",

Although this system offered adequate specialty or subspecialty training in medical knowledge, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, medical treatment or surgical procedures, it did not emphasize caring for the patient's psychological and social issues. In addition, due to the lack of interaction and cooperation between different specialists, it was difficult for each physician to be aware of the patient's overall condition; hence, patient-centered medicine and integrated medical care were not achieved. As a result, the general medical training program emerged and offered a model for training program reform [5].

At the individual level, a good faculty development program facilitates knowledge acquisition, attitudinal change, and skill development in medical education, especially for novice clinician-teachers or clinician-teachers with suboptimal teaching skills. For those who already excel in clinical teaching, the program can enhance the quality of teaching and introduce new effective teaching behaviors and concepts of medical education. At the curriculum development level, clinician-teachers trained in small groups are more prone to modify teaching behavior while providing a variety of teaching skills or attitude. This helps the promotion of general medical training in the future. At the institution level, the faculty development program brings change to the teaching atmosphere and leads to quality improvement in the whole organization [6].",

Therefore, the shortage of trained teachers was no longer a problem; however, the quality and competency of clinician-teachers became the most important issue [13]. For those clinician-teachers who were competent and enthusiastic, the pressure of academic promotion had a great impact on distribution of their time in teaching. In addition, the influence from policies stipulated by Taiwan's National Health Insurance system, the evolution of the medical education system, and the trend of globalization had a significant impact on students' clinical learning, selection of specialization, and meeting social expectations of the medical profession. The development of technology and internationalization also changed the learning behavior of medical students; therefore, clinician-teachers needed to be multifaceted, perceptive of society, and aware of students' learning rights, in order to cope with the rapidly changing society [2]. Consequently, it became vital to raise incentives for participation in faculty development training and establish a good reward system. Institutes should attend to clinician-teachers' needs and difficulties, create a good teaching environment, and promote motivation. In addition, additional training courses should be offered and more opportunities to pursue degrees in medical education should be provided [14], [15].",

In addition to recruitment of competent clinician-teachers, teaching institutions should provide learners with library resources, research laboratories, clinical equipment, and adequate study space. In addition, schools should maintain an appropriate administrative system where its function should extend to provide a full range of education resources, and not just limited to the preservation of academic information. Teaching institutions were encouraged to create a positive learning environment in order to foster academic knowledge acquisition, good quality of care, and research.
