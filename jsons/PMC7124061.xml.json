During the embryonic period, the primitive lung bud arises from the foregut, elongates caudally, and branches to form the major airways. The pseudoglandular phase follows; the process of branching continues and the smaller airways are formed. Fetal breathing movements are identified as early as 8 weeks, and by the end of this phase, the two lobes of the left lung and three lobes of the right lung can be identified. Cartilage and smooth muscle cells are present, and about half of the epithelial cell types that will eventually comprise the mature lung are identifiable. The airway branching is completed, the interstitial tissue decreases, and prospective gas exchange regions begin to appear during the canalicular phase. A differentiation process occurs in the cuboidal epithelial cells, and Type I and II pneumocytes appear. Type I pneumocytes are the functional exchange unit of the lung, while Type II pneumocytes produce surfactant, a phospholipid substance that serves to decrease surface tension within the Type I cell and prevent it from collapsing. Vascularization of the lung occurs throughout development, and, at this point, the capillaries can be found in close proximity to the pneumocytes. The saccular phase of development extends from 24 weeks through 38 weeks gestation. During this time, there is continued thinning of the connective tissue between the potential air spaces, further maturation of the Type II pneumocytes, and increased surfactant production. Primitive alveoli, lined by both Type I and Type II pneumocytes, can now be identified as pouches in the walls of the saccules and respiratory bronchioles (Table 11.1).\n",

Within a few months the infant\u2019s alveoli resemble those of the adult, with greatly increased surface area available for gas exchange. Completion of the vascularization process during this time results in single capillary networks associated with each area of gas exchange [118, 150].

According to autopsy studies [99], the maximum numbers of alveoli are achieved by approximately 8 years of age. After this point it is believed that alveolar surface volume increases without an increase in alveolar number [149]. However, recent studies have suggested that formation of new alveoli may continue into adolescence [99]. In regard to musculoskeletal development, radiographic measurement of lung diameters demonstrates linear growth during childhood and a spurt at puberty [142].",

Lung injury following low-dose bleomycin may be idiosyncratic, possibly attributable to genetically impaired drug metabolism. Having inherently low levels of bleomycin hydrolase [76], an enzyme that inactivates bleomycin, the lung is particularly vulnerable to bleomycin injury. Mouse data demonstrate that strain sensitivity to bleomycin is related to different levels of bleomycin hydrolase activity [62]. Hence, individual variations in bleomycin sensitivity may be explained at least in part by genetically determined levels of bleomycin hydrolase activity. Free radical formation and oxidative damage also play a role in bleomycin-induced lung injury. Fibrosis after bleomycin therapy develops under the influence of immune processes that include activation of effector cells, including alveolar macrophages, and release of cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor may play a pivotal role [82, 106]. Pathology demonstrates endothelial and Type I cell necrosis with Type II hyperplasia and hyaline membranes. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary effects usually occur during or within a year of treatment.",

The fibrosis noted after nitrosourea therapy demonstrates less inflammation than bleomycin-induced fibrosis, but consistency in Type I depletion and Type II hyperplasia with excess collagen deposition. The formation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation of phospholipid membranes may also be the mechanism by which cyclophosphamide and mitomycin damage the capillary endothelium [28]. Permeability increases, resulting in interstitial edema. Hyaline membranes form as plasma proteins, and fluid enters the alveoli through the denuded epithelium. Type I pneumocytes swell, become necrotic, and are replaced by cuboidal cells. Proliferation of fibroblasts then occurs. This process may evolve slowly, with fibrosis increasing over a period of years. Interstitial pneumonitis (either the desquamative type that appears to be an earlier stage or the usual type with fibrinous exudation, hyaline membranes, and interstitial fibrosis) is also seen with alkylating agents. This pneumonitis may lead to the development of chronic pulmonary fibrosis that is characterized by the enhanced production and deposition of collagen and other matrix components. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, with vasculitis and intimal fibrosis resulting in pulmonary hypertension, has been reported after either bleomycin or mitomycin [34].",

The cells become pleomorphic and vacuolated and may slough, thereby producing areas of denuded basement membrane and occlusion of the capillary lumen by debris and thrombi [51, 79, 86, 116]. There is exudation of proteinaceous material into the alveoli, leading to impairment of gas exchange. Studies have shown that radiation-induced lung injury is characterized by alveolar infiltrates of mononuclear cells, primarily CD4+ T cells and macrophages/monocytes (mononuclear alveolitis), and that there is a relative scarcity of neutrophils [40, 43], a common marker for infectious processes. Lavage fluids obtained from bronchoscopy have confirmed this finding in patients with active pneumonitis [84, 98, 124]. In a few weeks the interstitial edema organizes into collagen fibrils, which eventually leads to thickening of the alveolar septa. These exudative changes may resolve in a few weeks to a few months. However, depending on the volume of lung parenchyma irradiated, the total dose, and the dose per fraction, the changes can result in an acute radiation pneumonitis.",

The type II pneumocyte, which produces surfactant and maintains patent alveoli, has been well studied. After radiation exposure a rapid decrease in the content of cytoplasmic surfactant-containing lamellar bodies occurs, followed by the ultimate sloughing of some of the cells into the alveolar lumen [111, 112]. Changes in the surfactant system that lead to alterations in alveolar surface tension and low compliance are most likely a direct result of the radiation [113, 130, 131], although it has been postulated that the changes indirectly result from exudation of plasma proteins [52]. Endothelial cell damage results in changes in perfusion and permeability of the vessel wall. Endothelial leakage and increased permeability allow immune cells to undergo transendothelial migration and extravasation from the vascular compartment into the alveolar space.",

The alveoli collapse and are obliterated by connective tissue. The mechanisms of chronic injury may be related to the effects of radiation on the pulmonary vasculature (endothelial cells) or somatic cells. The nature of the triggering event in the pathogenesis of radiation-related lung fibrosis is complex. The classic hypothesis that fibrosis is a connective tissue replacement process following parenchymal cell death has been challenged, and the exact mechanisms of early injuries leading to the late effects are not entirely understood. Cytokine-mediated multicellular interactions that initiate and sustain the fibrogenic process take place within hours to days after radiation in animal research models. Experimental data suggest that the progression of the initial lung injury to the pneumonitic phase may be the result of a cytokine and cellular interaction, which subsequently regulates the fibrotic phase of the presentation [24, 127\u2013129]. In addition, it has been recently hypothesized that chronic hypoxia, and the perpetual injury to normal tissue through reactive oxygen species, may also be a contributing mechanism to chronic and progressive fibrosis [158]. Studies in animals have confirmed the protective effect of fractionated radiation therapy, which is several small doses of radiation as compared to a comparable dose delivered in a single large treatment, indicating a significant degree of recovery of lung tissue between fractions [141, 160].",

This self-report study demonstrated that long-term survivors described a statistically significant increased relative risk of lung fibrosis, recurrent pneumonia, chronic cough, pleurisy, use of supplemental oxygen, abnormal chest wall, exercise-induced SOB, bronchitis, recurrent sinus infection, and tonsillitis for all time periods, including during therapy, from the completion of therapy to 5 years off therapy and >5 years after therapy. Significant associations existed between the development of fibrosis and treatment with radiation therapy and between the use of supplemental oxygen, recurrent pneumonia, chronic cough, and pleurisy and treatment with radiation therapy and/or multiple chemotherapy agents [92]. In regard to mortality, a large retrospective study of greater than 20,000 5-year survivors of childhood cancer reported a significant excess rate of deaths largely due to treatment-related causes rather than progression or recurrence of the primary disease; furthermore, pulmonary causes accounted for excess mortality risk (standard mortality ratio, 8.8) second only to death from secondary malignancy (standard mortality ratio, 15.2) [7].",

            "text": "The clinical symptomatology related to the radiographic changes is proportional to the extent of the lung parenchyma involved and preexisting pulmonary reserve. After thoracic radiation, restrictive changes gradually develop and progress with time [51]. Gas exchange abnormalities occur approximately at the same time as the changes in lung volumes. These abnormalities consist of a fall in diffusion capacity, mild arterial hypoxemia that may manifest only with exercise, and a low or normal PaCO2 level. The changes appear to be consistent with a parenchymal lung defect and ventilation\u2013perfusion inequality that results in a component of effective shunt [52]. Radionuclide evaluations have demonstrated that underperfusion, rather than underventilation, is the cause of these inequalities, reflecting radiation injury to the microvasculature [119, 120, 157]. Larger doses of irradiation cause reductions in lung compliance that start at the time of pneumonitis and persist thereafter [117]. The compliance of the chest wall is usually much less affected in adults and adolescents than in young children, in whom interference with growth of both lung and chest wall leads to marked reductions in mean total lung volumes and diffusion capacity (DLCO) [165]. Whole-lung irradiation in doses of 11\u201314 Gy has resulted in restrictive changes in the lungs of children treated for various malignancies [10, 83, 93]. Consequently, RT in younger children, particularly those younger than 3 years old, results in increased chronic toxicity [93]. One to 2 years after radiation, clinical symptoms stabilize and are often minimal if fibrosis is limited to less than 50 % of one lung [134]. A mild deterioration in pulmonary function may be demonstrated as fibrosis develops. There is a reduction in maximum breathing capacity that is particularly evident in patients with bilateral radiation fibrosis. Tidal volume usually decreases, and breathing frequency tends to increase, resulting in an overall moderate increase in minute ventilation [139]. Most studies have found these changes to persist indefinitely, with little recovery unless there are concurrent improvements in pulmonary function with lung tumor response [41, 45, 50]. Functional compensation by adjacent lung regions [100] limits the effect of radiation on pulmonary function tests when small volumes of lung are irradiated. Dyspnea and progressive chronic cor pulmonale leading to right heart failure may occur when >50 % of a lung is irradiated.",

Chest radiographs have linear streaking, radiating from the area of previous pneumonitis and sometimes extending outside the irradiated region, with concomitant regional contraction, pleural thickening, and tenting of the diaphragm. The hilum or mediastinum may be retracted with a densely contracted lung segment, resulting in compensatory hyperinflation of the adjacent or contralateral lung tissue. This is usually seen 12 months to 2 years after radiation. When chronic fibrosis occurs in the absence of an earlier clinically evident pneumonitic phase [113, 126, 140], chest radiography generally reveals scarring that corresponds to the shape of the radiation portal. Eventually, dense fibrosis can develop, especially in the area of a previous tumor [127]. CT is currently favored to image regions subjected to RT [81, 85, 155]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being explored and may have promise in accurately distinguishing radiation fibrosis from recurrent tumor. Although radiation tolerance doses may be exceeded, not all patients will develop complications, given that the sensitivity to radiation varies from patient to patient.",

Studies of fatal pneumonitis following TBI and HBI conducted by Keane et al. [71] and Fryer et al.

The threshold dose for fatal pneumonitis was 7.0 Gy with the TD5 (tolerance dose for 5 % probability of death) at 8.2 Gy, the TD50 at 9.3 Gy, and the TD90 at 11.0 Gy, corrected for pulmonary transmission.

Doses above 30 Gy over a period of 10\u201315 days, and 45\u201350 Gy over a period of 25\u201330 days, caused radiographic changes in 30\u201390 % of patients. The need for a clinical guideline in estimating radiation injury prompted the collaborative work by a task force to address the normal tissue tolerance in the standard, fractionated radiation setting. Information was obtained from a diverse group of patients afflicted with various diseases of the thoracic region, but mostly from patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease, lung cancer, or a disease requiring large-volume irradiation (hemibody or total body radiation) [37].

The authors note that some of the variation around the fitted curve is possibly explained by differences in patient selection, as well as differences in the grade of RP reported in the various studies; however, there is a relatively small 68 % confidence interval (stippled lines). Of importance is the gradual increase in dose\u2013response, which suggests that there is no absolute \u201csafe\u201d mean lung dose below which pneumonitis is certain not to develop.\n",

One study in children with rhabdomyosarcoma exposed to bleomycin demonstrated an incidence of toxicity of 70 % based on decreased DLCO [67]. A risk factor for bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity is the cumulative dose with a 10 % risk at doses of 400\u2013500 IU/m2 [14, 132] although injury may occur at doses as low as 20 IU/m2. The elderly [14] and children or adolescents [44] may be more sensitive, especially when bleomycin is administered in conjunction with RT. Of children treated for Hodgkin\u2019s disease with 70\u2013120 IU/m2 of bleomycin [44], 9 % had grade 3 or 4 pulmonary toxicity, according to DLCO. Three patients (5 %) had clinical symptomatology, and one patient died. Only one patient had received RT. Although pediatric trials now use a significantly lower maximal dose than many adult studies, 80 % of the drug is excreted by the kidney, which can result in an increased risk of toxicity due to renal insufficiency [114, 143]. Other chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vincristine [8, 121] may also increase risk. Exposure to high levels of oxygen or to pulmonary infection, especially within a year of treatment, is associated with a risk for immediate progressive respiratory failure [47]. Risks associated with surgery after treatment with bleomycin may be due to fluid overload [35]. These risks may persist for longer periods of time. There may be a potential increase in pulmonary toxicity with the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is mediated via the increased numbers of neutrophils [30].",

Pulmonary function testing reveals a restrictive ventilatory defect with hypoxia, hypocapnia, and chronic respiratory alkalosis due to impaired diffusion and hyperventilation [154]. The DLCO is thought by some to be the most sensitive screening tool for bleomycin toxicity [154].

Fibrosis may be early onset or late onset. Radiation therapy also increases risk, as does underlying pulmonary abnormality, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although this is rarely a factor in children. Bone marrow transplant patients may develop pulmonary fibrosis with BCNU as one of the contributing etiologies [103]. As part of a preparative regimen including etoposide and melphalan, BCNU at 600 mg/m2 was associated with unacceptable pulmonary toxicity, but doses of 450 mg/m2 were tolerated in the acute period [2]. Chemotherapy prior to bone marrow transplant may induce inflammatory changes that render the lung more susceptible to further, potentially irreversible, injury with high-dose therapy [12]. Although pulmonary fibrosis has been most commonly associated with BCNU, it has been described after other nitrosoureas as well [13, 33]. Bibasilar rales with a bibasilar reticular pattern may be seen on chest radiograph, and restrictive ventilatory defects are seen as well. Abnormalities may be restricted to the upper lobes. A decreased diffusion capacity may precede all other signs [137]. Discontinuation of therapy may alter the course of BCNU-induced pulmonary disease. However, once pulmonary infiltrates are noted, the disease may be irreversible [162]. In a documented study, 47 % of survivors of childhood brain tumors treated with BCNU and radiation died of lung fibrosis, 12 % within 3 years of treatment, and the remainder 6\u201317 years posttreatment. Additional patients were known to have pulmonary fibrosis and remained at risk for late decompensation. In this study, age was a risk factor. The median age of the patients who died was 2.5 years, while the median age of survivors was 10 years. In fact, all patients treated under the age of 5 years had died [104].",

However, one study [72] found that 4 of 15 children treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide without mediastinal RT had significantly decreased forced vital capacities; 2 of these children also had a decreased FEV1. In addition, one of the children had pulmonary fibrosis and a chest wall deformity. Two children who received more than 50 g/m2 of cyclophosphamide had delayed (greater than 7 years) fatal pulmonary fibrosis, with severe restrictive lung disease. Severely decreased anteroposterior chest dimensions in these patients were attributed to inability of the lung to grow in accordance with body growth. Fibrosis may also develop late after prolonged treatment with relatively low doses of cyclophosphamide. Although there may be recovery if symptoms occur during therapy and the drug is discontinued with administration of corticosteroids, the course may be one of progressive fibrosis nonetheless.",

Although most transplant survivors are not clinically compromised, restrictive lung disease may occur. Obstructive disease is less common, as is the recently described late-onset pulmonary syndrome, which includes the spectrum of restrictive and obstructive disease. Bronchiolitis obliterans, with or without organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, and interstitial pneumonia, may occur as a component of this syndrome, generally 6\u201312 months after transplant. Cough, dyspnea, or wheezing may occur with either normal chest radiograph or diffuse or patchy infiltrates; however, most patients are symptom-free [78, 162]. Cerveri et al. [21] evaluated pulmonary function tests in survivors of pediatric HSCT at baseline and at 3\u20136, 12, and 24 months after transplant. Before transplant, at 3\u20136 months after transplant, and at 24 months after transplant, 44 %, 85 %, and 62 % of children, respectively, had abnormal pulmonary function tests. A restrictive abnormality was most common at 3\u20136 months after transplant.",

The study found that children who underwent surgery before the age of 5 years had ventilatory capacity close to what would be predicted for two lungs, which the authors argue suggests that compensatory growth by way of hyperplasia might have been the most important adaptive mechanism in this group. Perhaps more surprisingly, even in the patients who underwent surgery between the ages of 6 and 20 years, a significant difference was still found as compared to the group of patients operated on at an older age, which indicates that in this period compensatory growth, possibly simple hypertrophy, still played an important but gradually decreasing role.",

Testing the effects of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, Phillips and colleagues [116] reported that the administration of dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and, to a lesser extent, vincristine enhanced the lethal potential of thoracic irradiation. The effect of dactinomycin was seen when given as long as 30 days before irradiation, but it was not seen when given 30 days after the irradiation. The administration of bleomycin and lung irradiation together produces lung toxicity that is more common and severe than when either agent is given alone. Catane [20] found pulmonary toxicity in 19 % of patients, and it was fatal in 10 %. This toxicity appears to be maximal when bleomycin is given concurrently with radiation [36]. Although 500 IU of bleomycin without RT can be lethal in 1\u20132 % of patients, as little as 30 IU can be fatal when given with RT. The effects of RT are also potentiated by doxorubicin. In addition to the enhanced toxicity observed in skin, intestines, and heart, the lung also appears to be very sensitive to this combination [18, 22]. Of 24 patients with lung cancer treated with low-dose doxorubicin and RT, 13 developed pneumonitis [156].",

            "text": "There is a need for early biochemical markers of normal tissue damage that would predict late effects and that would allow the radiation oncologist and medical oncologist to determine whether their treatment is exceeding normal tissue tolerance [126]. If biochemical markers of tissue damage could be detected in the subclinical phase, prior to the accumulation of significant injury, one could terminate therapy or institute treatment to prevent or attenuate later lesions. An ideal marker would be a simple, reproducible, biochemical test. In the recent years, some circulating cytokine markers have been independently found to be potential predictors of radiation pneumonitis. These include proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) [25, 26], fibrotic cytokine-transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) [4], and ICAM [65]. Chen and colleagues tested the ability of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6 measurements to predict radiation pneumonitis [23]. The predictive power of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6 appeared to be strongest for the blood samples collected prior to radiotherapy than during RT. While both inflammatory cytokines can serve as diagnostic testing tools, IL-6 was found to be a more powerful predictor than IL-1\u03b1 of radiation pneumonitis. The specificity and positive predictive value of IL-6 were as high as 80 % for the blood samples collected prior to RT. The application of these cytokine markers in the predictive diagnosis of radiation pneumonitis may prove to have clinical utility in the near future and deserves further investigation.",

The detection of abnormalities may allow for better anticipatory guidance and counseling. Counseling on the risks of smoking and environmental tobacco smoke exposure is imperative for these patients, even in the absence of symptoms or abnormalities on evaluation. Patients should also be aware of the potential risks of general anesthesia and notify physicians of their treatment history if they are to undergo anesthesia. For those with compromised lung condition, therapy should be tailored to minimize injury from cytotoxic agents and radiation damage. When following survivors of cancer, vigilant evaluation of symptoms of respiratory compromise is necessary and should be anticipated when thoracic RT or drugs with known pulmonary toxicity have been used. Depending on the findings and other circumstances, lung biopsy may be considered to confirm fibrosis or exclude the recurrence of cancer. Chronic cough, dyspnea, or change in exercise should be further evaluated with chest radiography and PFTs. This is also imperative in patients scheduled for general anesthesia. In the absence of symptoms, chest radiographs and lung function testing are recommended every 2\u20135 years. The number of potential pulmonary toxic agents, the cumulative doses, and the radiation dose and field size are all factors to be considered in setting follow-up intervals.",

Confirmation of this benefit and whether like interventions can reduce long-term pulmonary sequelae requires further study. The role of amifostine as a radioprotector in preventing lung toxicity has been investigated. Amifostine is a sulfhydryl compound that was originally developed as an agent to protect against ionizing radiation in the event of nuclear war [31, 133]. It was also found to protect normal tissues from toxicities of radiotherapy for head and neck tumors [17], alkylating agents, and cisplatin [161, 166]. Recent clinical studies have shown a reduction in pneumonitis using amifostine in chemoradiation treatments for lung cancer [5, 73]; however, further investigation is required until its use becomes standard clinical practice.",

Supportive care with bronchodilators, expectorants, antibiotics, bed rest, and oxygen can be beneficial for relief of symptoms in pneumonitis and fibrosis. In cases of radiation or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis in which corticosteroids have been used, it is important to withdraw steroids very slowly to avoid reactivation.

It is essential, of course, that they do not disturb the efficacy of the treatment. Improvement of radiotherapy targeting and normal tissue sparing, such as three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), will minimize radiation to nontarget normal lung tissue. Novel interventions, such as mechanisms to increase the level of bleomycin hydrolase in susceptible patients or viral-mediated transfer of a bleomycin resistance gene, may hold promise for future applications in clinical treatment. What may prove to be the most important is the recognition of those at enhanced risk for long-term pulmonary toxicity as a result of their genotype.
