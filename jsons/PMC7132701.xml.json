For highly communicable diseases, there are 2 major areas that place a health care facility and the personnel at substantial risk for disease acquisition and transmission.10 First, inadequate screening procedures when patients enter a health care facility can potentially allow transmission from an ill patient to health care personnel, other patients, or visitors. Second, inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and/or training of health care personnel (HCP) in proper donning and doffing procedures can increase the risk of exposure for HCP.",

Preventing disease acquisition via person-to-person transmission or contact with the contaminated environment depends on rapid and appropriate institution of isolation precautions, appropriate hand hygiene, and appropriate disinfection of medical equipment, devices, and the surface environment. Importantly, once the nature of the emerging disease is known (ie, enveloped virus, bacteria, fungi, nonenveloped virus, mycobacteria), it is possible to determine the proper antiseptics and disinfectants, even in the absence of studies of the exact infectious agent.21 For example, an enveloped virus (eg, Ebola, MERS-CoV) or vegetative bacterium (eg, CRE) would be inactivated by any agent active against nonenveloped viruses or mycobacteria. It is important to remember that alcohol has reduced activity against nonenveloped viruses (eg, norovirus) and no activity against spores (eg, Clostridioides difficile).",

First, viable Ebola can survive in liquids (eg, liquid media, tissue culture media, water, liquid blood, plasma) for days to weeks. Second, viable Ebola virus can also survive dried on a variety of surfaces (eg, plastic, glass, stainless steel, polypropylene, nitrile, bank notes) for days to weeks. Third, Ebola survives in liquids and on surfaces for a longer duration of time at lower temperatures (eg, 4\u00b0C vs 21\u00b0C). Fourth, although aerosol transmission has not been observed, Ebola virus has been demonstrated to survive in an aerosol for >3 hours. Fifth, survival of Ebola on porous surfaces, such as cotton, is substantially less than on steel and plastic surfaces.",

Smither et al55 confirmed the activity of sodium hypochlorite; 104 Ebola viruses as measured by PCR were inactivated by 0.75% sodium hypochlorite with 10 minutes contact time. In a later study, Smither et al56 reported that multiple disinfectants (ie, 0.5% hypochlorite, 10% hypochlorite, 5% peracetic acid, 70% ethanol) were effective against dried cell culture medium containing Ebola virus. However, only 5% peracetic acid consistently reduced Ebola virus titers in dried blood to undetectable levels. Based on the hierarchy of microbial susceptibility to germicides and studies of germicide efficacy, the CDC states that any US Environmental Protection Agency- (EPA) registered hospital disinfectant with a label claim for a nonenveloped virus (eg, norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus) can be used to disinfect environmental surfaces in rooms of patients with known or suspected EVD.57\n",

Four high-level disinfectants achieved >4-log10 kill for all tested strains, but 0.55% ortho-phthalaldehyde achieved a 2.4-4.8-log10 kill depending on the CRE strain tested. Eight disinfectants all achieved a >4-log10 kill.

The activity of low-level disinfectants has been most comprehensively investigated using the disc-based quantitative carrier test and is summarized in Table 5\n.152, 153 Importantly, both investigators added 5% fetal calf serum to assess germicidal efficacy under more stringent conditions (ie, presence of proteins). Importantly, quaternary ammonium disinfectants alone were significantly less effective against C auris than other products.152, 153 Some investigators reported that concentrations of sodium hypochlorite \u22651,000 ppm were effective in killing >4-log10\nC auris in 3-5 minutes,150, 151 whereas others153 reported sodium hypochlorite \u223c1,200 ppm at an exposure time of 1 minute resulted in only a 1.6-log10 reduction in C auris. It is unclear whether the longer exposure times and lack of protein load led to the high reduction rates reported by Abdolrasouli et al150 and Moore et al.151 However, all investigators have reported that a 1:10 dilution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite is effective in killing >4-log10\nC auris even with short exposure times (ie, 1 minute) and in the presence of protein.152, 153 Based on current studies, the CDC states \u201cQuaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) that are routinely used for disinfection may not be effective against C auris\u2026.Until further information is available for C auris, CDC recommends use of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered hospital-grade disinfectant effective against Clostridium difficile spores (List K)\u201d.154 CDC further states that when the use of products on List K is not feasible, published research has found that the following products led to a substantial reduction (>4-log10) of C auris in laboratory testing: Oxivir TB (Diversey Inc., Charlotte, NC), Clorox Healthcare Hydrogen Peroxide Cleaner Disinfectant (Clorox, Oakland, CA), Prime Sani-Cloth Wipe (PDI, Inc., Woodcliff, NJ), and Super Sani-Cloth Wipe (PDI, Inc., Woodcliff, NJ).154\n",

            "text": "The activity of antiseptics against C auris has been studied by several investigators (Table 6\n). There is good agreement that 70% alcohol (both isopropyl and ethyl) is effective against C auris at 1 minute. Importantly, the activity of alcohol has not been studied at the times used by most health care providers when performing hand hygiene (ie, 10-15 seconds). Unfortunately, studies on the activity of other important antiseptics such as chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone-iodine have produced variable results (Table 6). This variability is likely explained by differences in the test conditions including in vitro versus human challenge, duration of exposure, and presence of a protein load (eg, fetal calf serum). It appears that 10% povidone-iodine would provide adequate skin antisepsis if applied for \u22651 minute. Using a panel of C auris clinical isolates, Kean et al,156 screened them for their planktonic and sessile susceptibilities to skin disinfection challenge using povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate, and hydrogen peroxide. C auris biofilms displayed increased tolerance to antisepsis compared with planktonic cells. Analysis using a complex biofilm model demonstrated reduced susceptibility against clinically relevant concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.05%) and hydrogen peroxide (3%), with eradication achieved only with povidone-iodine (10%). As noted by Forsberg et al,136 whether topical antiseptics might reduce the burden of C auris on the skin, and therefore provide a potentially valuable tool for infection prevention, remains unclear. The CDC states that when caring for patients with C auris \u201chealthcare personnel should follow standard hand hygiene practices, which include alcohol-based hand sanitizer use or, if hands are visibly soiled, washing with soap and water. Wearing gloves is not a substitute for hand hygiene.\u201d154\n",
