However, many at\u2010risk individuals do not get vaccinated,4 and some vulnerable groups such as the very elderly and the immunosuppressed respond poorly to the vaccine. Furthermore, protection is reduced if there is a mismatch between the circulating strain and the vaccine, and in the event of a newly emerging influenza strain, such as the recent pandemic A (H1N1) 2009, vaccines may be unavailable for several months. Antiviral drugs are available; the M2 protein inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir) shorten and reduce severity of illness and may reduce complications, but need to be commenced within 48 hours of onset.5 Resistance has already emerged in some strains and remains a potential risk for the future.6 Therefore, it is important that we continue to investigate new therapies that can be used independently or in conjunction with treatments currently available.",

Oral IFN administration at very low doses is believed to mimic a natural mode of action and result in a concentration of type 1 IFN in local nasal mucosa similar to that induced by exposure to respiratory viruses. Investigation into the physiological levels of endogenous type 1 IFN during viral infections has reported levels between 116 IU/ml8 and 138 IU/ml9 in nasal secretions and only 10\u201330 IU/ml in serum.9 This is approximately 10 000\u2013100 000 times less than doses delivered parenterally for the treatment of hepatitis C.

While the mechanism underlying effective low\u2010dose oral IFN therapy is unknown, murine studies have shown that IFN\u2010\u03b1 administered to the oral cavity is retained by tissues proximal to lymphoid regions, including the posterior nasal cavity, posterior tongue and small intestine,22 and type I interferon receptors are also present at high concentrations in the oropharyngeal cavity and elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract.19 It is hypothesized that IFN delivered by the oral route binds to receptors on specialized cells in the oral and/or pharyngeal cavity and elicits a therapeutic immune response without the need for delivery of exogenous IFN into the systemic circulation.7 Oral administration of low\u2010dose recombinant IFN 1 has been shown to produce immunomodulatory effects in animal studies19, 20, 23 and human clinical trials,24, 25, 26 and to reduce influenza mortality in a mouse model.21 It has been well tolerated in these trials with no evidence of significant adverse effects. Therefore, we undertook a clinical trial to examine the efficacy of low\u2010dose oral IFN in the prevention of acute respiratory illness during the winter influenza season in Western Australia in 2009, which coincided with the emergence of the pandemic A/(H1N1) 2009 virus.",

Mild symptoms cause minimal discomfort and do not interfere in a significant manner with normal activities; moderate symptoms are sufficiently uncomfortable to produce some impairment of normal activities; and severe symptoms are incapacitating and prevent participation in normal activities.

These were all independent predictors of a beneficial IFN\u03b1 effect. Also, the IFN\u03b1 treatment group had significantly fewer vaccinated participants compared with the placebo group (Table 1) and may have biased against an IFN\u03b1 effect in this study. For the age effects, we chose to analyse the effect of IFN\u03b1 on participants aged 50 years and above separately because they represented approximately 50% of our study population and are also recognized to be at increased risk of severe or complicated influenza.28 There were insufficient numbers to look in older age groups, such as those aged 65 years and above. Sex and age differences in the effects of type 1 IFN on hepatitis C29, 30 and in cytokine\u2010based immune responses have previously been reported, but the mechanisms behind these observations are unknown.31, 32, 33 The apparent effect of IFN\u03b1 in participants who had received the 2009 seasonal vaccine is intriguing and suggests that the IFN\u03b1 may have improved cross\u2010protection against the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 strain following seasonal influenza vaccination. It has been reported that the 2009 seasonal trivalent vaccine also afforded cross\u2010protection from confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza illness in up to 34% of those vaccinated.34 It has also been shown that prior exposure to pandemic H1N1 influenza strains that circulated until 1957 established immunological memory in the older population providing clinical protection from severe illness.35, 36 While the mechanism underlying these effects is unknown, animal studies suggest immunological priming of cross\u2010reactive memory CD4+ T cells and cytolytic CD8+ T cells.37, 38, 39 Others have proposed, and we agree, that IFN likely acts as an adjuvant further enhancing dendritic cell function to drive both humoral and cell\u2010mediated cross\u2010protection [40].
