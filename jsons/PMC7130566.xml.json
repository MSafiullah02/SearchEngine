As this was not expected and no other studies investigated the efficacy of influenza vaccination in smokers and non-smokers, we sought support for this finding in the antibody response after vaccination. A greater titre rise due to vaccination was observed in smokers compared to non-smokers for two out of four strains 3 weeks after vaccination. A greater antibody response was also found by Finklea et al.[9]. In their study pre-vaccination titres (that were lower for smokers than non-smokers) leveled up after vaccination. A possible explanation is that smokers develop a better immunological protection after vaccination, resulting in a lower incidence of serological influenza compared to non-smokers. The clinical relevance of this finding appears to be low, because no difference in efficacy of vaccination was found for clinical influenza between smokers and non-smokers in our study. Also, MacKenzie et al. and Knowles et al. found no greater antibody response in smokers compared to non-smokers after vaccination with influenza vaccine3, 8. Instead, hepatitis B vaccination has been shown to be less immunogenic in smokers versus non-smokers in several studies18, 19, 20. For example, for subjects receiving hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months (standard schedule) it was found that vaccinated smokers had lower antibody levels than non-smokers after 3, 7 and 13 months[18]. In summary, the tendency for smokers to have a higher antibody response than non-smokers found in our study is not found in other studies on influenza vaccination (except Finklea et al.) and hepatitis B vaccination. The greater protection against serological influenza in smokers compared to non-smokers found in our study is therefore hardly supported by other immunological data.",

A possible bias is that the measurement of the smoking status could be influenced by the outcome of clinical influenza, because smoking status was measured 10 weeks after the start of the investigation. However, the hypotheses about smoking were not known to the patients during the data collection, making it unlikely that patients tried to report their smoking status differently in order to please the investigators or to try and explain why they got influenza. Selection biases are unlikely to occur because the data used in this study resulted from a randomized clinical trial. Beyer et al., Palache, Gross et al. and Poirier et al. pointed out some shortcomings in the research on influenza vaccination6, 21, 22, 23. In many studies on the efficacy of vaccination pre-vaccination titres, previous vaccination status, age, gender and the health status were not taken into account. In our study previously vaccinated patients were excluded, no differences were found in pre-titres for smokers and non-smokers and corrections were made for age, gender and health status. Also vaccine doses are relevant for the interpretation of the results[23]. These vaccine doses were the same for all subjects. The influenza activity in the influenza season 1991\u20131992 in the Netherlands was dominated by the strains A/Singapore/6/86 (H1N1) and A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2) and therefore matched at least two of the strains used in the vaccine for that season[24].
