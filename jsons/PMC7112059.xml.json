            "text": "In November 2002, a new infectious disease now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in Guangdong Province, China, followed by rapid spread of this disease to other parts of China, other Asian countries, and the rest of the world. When the epidemic was over in late 2003, more than 8000 people had been infected, and close to 800 had died. In the summer of 2004, there was another, small-scale outbreak of SARS in Asian countries, but this time, it was quickly brought under control. However, the threat of yet another outbreak of SARS and other new infectious viral diseases continues to exist, and the need to understand all aspects of such diseases is urgent. Following the first outbreak, the tissue pathology of several organs was described extensively [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] and has thus contributed to the understanding of the probable pathogenesis of SARS. However, to date, the effects of SARS on the thyroid gland are unknown because no detailed histopathological investigation of the thyroid gland in patients with SARS has been reported. As SARS is a disease known to cause multiple organ injury [2], [3], [4], the possibility of thyroid gland injury must be taken into consideration. The thyroid gland is an organ whose neuroendocrine functions affect the entire body including the immune system [6], [7], [8]. The hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) produced in the follicular cells of the thyroid gland are responsible for regulating normal metabolic and neural activity. Calcitonin produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland plays an important role in modulating calcium homeostasis.",

In some cases, decreased T3 and T4 serum levels were detected suggesting follicular cell dysfunction [9], [10]. In other cases, osteonecrosis of the femoral head was found in recovered patients with SARS, which may have been caused by a decrease of inhibition of osteoclasts resulting from calcitonin deficiency [11], [12]. Therefore, in addition to steroid therapy, calcitonin deficiency caused by injury to the parafollicular cells may also have contributed to the pathogenesis of this common complication of SARS.",

To further investigate the effects of SARS associated coronavirus (CoV) on the thyroid, we have undertaken a detailed study of the thyroid gland with special attention to the pattern of cellular and architectural alterations on parafollicular and follicular cells. Because overexpression of certain nonstructural proteins of the SARS-CoV has shown the ability to induce apoptosis in several cell types in vitro, we made a working assumption that apoptosis among other factors might play a role in the pathogenesis of SARS [14], [15], [16], [17]. Therefore, we also used the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUPT nick end\u2013labeling (TUNEL) assay in this study.",

The presence of apoptosis was confirmed by the TUNEL assay. A previous study reported that serum levels of T3 and T4 in patients with SARS were significantly lower than those in the control group, and the more severe the disease, the lower the level of T3 in these patients. Serum T3 and T4 levels were decreased, respectively, in 94% and 46% of 48 patients with SARS during the acute phase and in 90% and 38% during the convalescent phase of the disease [9]. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration in patients with SARS was also significantly decreased compared with that of the control group [9]. The extent of morphological injury and the large quantity of cells undergoing apoptosis that we observed in the thyroid follicular epithelium provide an explanation for the diminished serum T3 and T4 levels in patients with SARS. In contrast, the reduced TSH level reported in patients with SARS cannot be readily explained by the destruction of follicular epithelium, as under normal circumstances, low serum levels of T3 and T4 would lead to an increased TSH level provided that the hypothalamus-pituitary function is intact. Therefore, the hypothalamus-pituitary dysfunction may be the underlying cause of low serum TSH. Leow et al [10] reported that 4 of 61 SARS survivors (6.7%) were hypothyroid including 3 cases with central hypothyroidism and 1 with primary hypothyroidism with positive autoimmune antibodies. In addition to hypothyroidism, they reported a more frequent occurrence of central hypocortisolism in a substantial number of patients with SARS. Hypocortisolism and hypothyroidism together may explain the frequent occurrence of the wide range of nonspecific symptoms found in recovered patients with SARS, which has been referred to as post-SARS sickness syndrome [10], [18]. Leow et al [10] postulated that SARS caused central hypocortisolism and hypothyroidism by inducing hypophysitis or by directly affecting the hypothalamus. Such a potential effect on the hypothalamus is consistent with the presence of edema and neuronal degeneration together with the identification of viral genome sequences in the hypothalamus and cortex of the brain of patients with SARS, as described in a previous report [4]. Some authors have suggested another explanation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, in which the temporary dysfunction of the HPA axis in recovered patients with SARS was ascribed to an adaptive physiological response to prolonged activation of the HPA axis during the acute phase of the disease [18]. With respect to hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis deficiency, our results seem to indicate that in addition to such hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction as is described above, primary injury to the thyroid gland itself may have a key role in the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism in patients with SARS.",

This strongly suggests that in addition to injury to the follicular cells, SARS infection also damages the structure and function of cells in the interfollicular tissue including parafollicular cells, to the extent that calcitonin production may be adversely affected.

The mechanism by which glucocorticoids induce osteoporosis through decrease of ossification by osteoblast inhibition and by stimulating the action of osteoclasts, which in turn accelerate bone resorption, is well known [21].

It appears that with prolongation of steroid administration, the degree of hypocalcemia increases [27]. Under normal circumstances, reduction of calcitonin would lead to elevation of serum calcium. However, serum calcium is regulated by a number of other factors including parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D3) [22], [29], as well as absorption by the intestines and secretion by the kidneys [22]. Most of the patients with SARS in this cohort (and most patients with SARS in general) received large dosages of glucocorticoids that would inhibit the production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and lead to hypocalcemia. Because SARS-CoV infects multiple organs and can cause severe damage to the function of the kidneys and intestines [5], [30], it is likely that this may also contribute to the reduced serum calcium level in SARS.",

In addition, there is evidence that apoptosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of SARS infection [15]. In vitro experiments have shown that overexpression of certain nonstructural SARS-CoV proteins can induce apoptosis [14], [15], [16], [17] in several cell types.

The damage to the parafollicular cells that was identified may result in calcitonin deficiency, which most likely contributes to the pathogenesis of femoral head necrosis, a common complication of SARS.
