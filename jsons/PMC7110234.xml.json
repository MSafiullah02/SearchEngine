HAP affects 0.5% to 1.0% of inpatients and is the most common healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) contributing to death.1 It is estimated to increase hospital stay by 7\u20139 days.2 In a proportion of patients, HAP is associated with mechanical ventilation, in which case it is termed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In patients with VAP, there is a 24% to 50% mortality rate, which increases to 76% if infection is caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens.3 VAP accounts for up to 25% of all intensive care unit (ICU) infections with the risk being highest during early ICU stay when it is estimated to be 3%/day during the first 5 days of ventilation, followed by 2%/day up to day 10 of ventilation and thereafter 1%/day.4 These features of high incidence with significant morbidity and mortality consequences have driven considerable recent interest in the creation of HAP guidelines. Prevention of HAP is therefore not only desirable but also essential for providing cost-effective healthcare. The Department of Health (DH) in its \u2018Saving Lives\u2019 initiative has seven high-impact interventions that are part of the programme to reduce HCAI and one of these relates to the care of the ventilated patient.5",

Over half of the available guidelines are based on expert opinion and cover only one or two of the three relevant areas of consideration. Recently, a number of guidelines have been published relating to prevention of both VAP7,8 and the combination of non-ventilator-associated HAP and VAP.6,9,10 These have been produced in different ways with none employing a full systematic review approach that fully meets an appraised quality methodology.",

In producing the guidelines, the Working Party adopted a systematic review approach using a formally evaluated quality assessment mechanism. The tool chosen was the guideline development process produced by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN).11 This methodology includes an explicit description of the level, definitions and volume of evidence, which is reviewed by a multidisciplinary development team. The product grades the recommendations according to the quality of supporting evidence with the output being subject to a final expert peer assessment prior to release (Table 1). The SIGN tool has been assessed against and meets the guideline quality requirements of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation instrument.11",

A cohort study15 also showed that introducing protocols and education was effective in reducing VAP by 50%. One other cohort study12 and a case\u2013control study16 demonstrated that as part of a broad intervention, programmed education can be successful in controlling staff-to-staff or staff-to-patient outbreaks of primary respiratory pathogens, e.g. pertussis and respiratory syncytial virus. A cohort study showed that when a higher proportion of care was provided by qualified registered nursing staff, there was a lower incidence of HAP.17 Studies therefore consistently provide evidence that staff education programmes both in themselves and as part of an overall infection control programme reduce the incidence of VAP.",

A further RCT found no difference in the rate of VAP in patients with ventilator circuits containing heat moisture exchangers (HMEs) where 48 h circuit changes were compared with no planned change.52 These studies were all conducted in ventilated patients where circuits were changed if there were signs of visible contamination or damage.

However, some studies have found an increasing frequency of early-onset HAP caused by pathogens more commonly associated with nosocomial disease. This has contributed to the concept of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), involving pathogens associated with recent prior hospitalization and/or antimicrobial therapy. HCAP has been defined as pneumonia occurring in any patient who had been admitted to an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within 90 days of the infection; or had been a resident in a nursing home or long-term care facility; or had attended a hospital or haemodialysis clinic; or had received recent intravenous antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care within the past 30 days of the current infection.7 Rarely, HAP/VAP is due to fungal infection and this is usually, although not exclusively, seen in severely immunocompromised patients.",

The first is that most publications deal with VAP, whereas most HAP occurs in non-ventilated and non-intubated patients. It may not be valid to extrapolate diagnostic criteria for VAP to HAP; for example, the diagnosis of VAP often involves invasive microbiological sampling, which may not be possible or appropriate in non-intubated patients. The second problem is that there are no universally accepted \u2018gold\u2019 or reference standard diagnostic criteria for HAP or VAP. Because of this, it is difficult to compare different diagnostic methods. Most studies begin by dividing patient groups into those with pneumonia and those without, but the criteria used for this division vary, and all have their problems. Thus, most studies have groups of patients that probably have pneumonia or probably do not, and in each there is an unknown proportion that will have been wrongly classified. For example, some patients, not thought to have HAP clinically, have been diagnosed at autopsy,161 and vice versa. We have not excluded such studies from this analysis, but have interpreted the results with caution. Recently, more useful studies have appeared that avoid these problems by analysing the outcomes of management based on different diagnostic techniques in a single group of patients suspected of having HAP.",

In a comparative study, immediate post mortem histology in 39 patients who had been mechanically ventilated for \u223c14 days was assessed against five clinical diagnostic criteria (fever, leucocytosis, positive sputum culture, worsening CXR changes and worsening gas exchange).173 None of the individual clinical criteria or any combination of them correlated with the presence or absence of histological pneumonia. Thus, there is only a moderate amount of evidence comparing clinical diagnostic criteria with reference criteria, including histology, and these data demonstrate that there can be considerable variation in the clinical presentation of HAP and that distinction from other forms of sepsis is difficult.",

            "text": "The clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) is an evolving clinical scoring system approach to the diagnosis of HAP. It is now based on six criteria [the original four\u2014fever, leucocytosis, positive sputum culture and worsening CXR changes\u2014plus oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) and semi-quantitative cultures of tracheal aspirates with or without Gram's stain]. These developments have been claimed to further increase diagnostic sensitivity.174,175 A prospective case series176 studied 25 deceased patients who had been mechanically ventilated before death. The presence of both histological pneumonia and positive lung cultures immediately post mortem was used as a reference test for VAP. In these patients, the CPIS was not superior to conventional clinical criteria for the diagnosis of VAP before death. A prospective cohort study169 investigated the utility of a modified CPIS in the diagnosis of HAP. Conventional clinical diagnosis was found to be inaccurate (sensitivity 50%, specificity 58%) and the CPIS was only slightly more accurate (sensitivity 60%, specificity 59%). Adding a Gram's stain result from a BAL specimen slightly increased the accuracy of both conventional (sensitivity 85%, specificity 49%) and CPIS (sensitivity 78%, specificity 56%) diagnosis. However, although the CPIS has not been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy compared with conventional clinical assessment, it has been used successfully to monitor and modify therapy. A prospective, multicentre cohort study177 of ventilated patients with suspected VAP used serial measurements of CPIS to monitor the clinical course of VAP and successfully identified patients with a good prognosis by day 3. A further study178 investigated patients with pulmonary infiltrates with suspected VAP but with a CPIS score of \u22646 (low likelihood of pneumonia). Patients were randomized to receive standard therapy or ciprofloxacin monotherapy with discontinuation at day 3 if the CPIS remained \u22646. Compared with patients on standard therapy, those on ciprofloxacin monotherapy had significantly lower antimicrobial costs, antimicrobial resistance and superinfections but no difference in length of stay or mortality. The authors concluded that the CPIS could be used to identify patients who would benefit from a short course of antibiotics.",

These newer techniques are not useful for initial investigations. CT can be useful as an additional diagnostic tool to exclude other pathology in a patient with a complex CXR, but the role of MR and PET in the diagnosis of HAP/VAP has not been assessed. The diagnostic value of CXR is usually greater in HAP than VAP, because of the problems of performing mobile radiographic investigations on ventilated patients who cannot be moved and because of other cardiothoracic co-morbidities often present in such patients. Ventilated patients may have abnormal CXR secondary to other pathology that must be distinguished from infection, e.g. acute lung injury, left ventricular failure, aspiration or alveolar haemorrhage. Radiological investigations of patients with VAP do not often influence outcome and are more useful in patients with non-ventilated HAP where they may provide information on differential diagnosis, complications or the exclusion of other pathology. Therefore, although the presence of an alveolar infiltrate on the CXR raises the possibility of HAP as well as other differential diagnoses, there are no key imaging investigations that can establish the diagnosis of HAP, though a normal CXR excludes HAP.",

Qualitative EA cultures had a high sensitivity, moderate positive predictive value and high negative predictive value. The authors concluded that EA cultures were unreliable for the diagnosis of VAP. The use of EA samples has been analysed in three more-recent papers. In a study199 of ventilated trauma patients with strong clinical and radiological evidence of VAP, an assessment was made of sampling respiratory secretions by EA, directed PSB, blind protected brushing via ET tube and bronchoscopy-directed BAL. The value of quantifying the percentage of infected cells in specimens by Gram's stain was also analysed. There was moderate agreement by kappa (\u03ba) analysis between quantitative cultures of EA and BAL, and the sensitivity and specificity of quantification of infected cells in EA samples, using quantitative culture of BAL as the standard, were 96.7% and 48.9%, respectively. Another cohort study201 identified patients with VAP based on clinical evidence and culture results of BAL and evaluated the significance of quantitative cultures with a diagnostic threshold of >105 cfu/mL for EA and >104 cfu/mL for BAL. From this study the reported sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, negative predictive values and correct classification (into pneumonia or not pneumonia) were EA: 82%, 67%, 82%, 67% and 77%; and BAL: 94%, 100% 100%, 90% and 96%, respectively.

            "text": "There are many limitations in the quality of the available evidence to assist in approaches to antimicrobial selection in HAP. Few studies have compared more than two therapeutic options and very few studies had sufficient power to demonstrate the superiority of one regimen over another. A further limitation is that the primary microbiological evaluations were invariably related to patients whose pathogens were susceptible to the trial antibiotics. Only six studies recruited 200 or more patients to both treatment and comparator arms.225\u2013230 Only five studies were randomized double-blind studies.225,226,230\u2013232 In several studies, so, few patients were enrolled that the likelihood of a type II error is high.178,233\u2013259 Finally, none of the studies addressed patient demography and risk factors or assessed empirical or definitive treatment in relation to severity of illness or duration of hospitalization. There are only a few studies that differentiate between Gram-positive225,226,231,260 and Gram-negative pathogens alone.233,245,250,254,255,257,261,262 Most studies looked at a mix of Gram-positive and -negative pathogens228\u2013230,232,236,237,240,241,243,248,250,252\u2013254,257,263\u2013283 Several studies enrolled patients who were either ventilated or non-ventilated. Where the therapy was active against the pathogens, there were no differences between the groups in terms of assessed outcome whether clinical or microbiological. For all of the above reasons it is not possible to identify an optimal antibiotic regimen. However, although the pathogens and their susceptibility patterns associated with late-onset HAP are highly variable, those found in early-onset infections are few in number and remarkably consistent from centre to centre (see Section 3.4.1).",

Sixteen RCTs have enrolled patients with HAP and compared patients receiving monotherapy (carbapenems, cephalosporins or ureidopenicillin) with those receiving combination therapy [cephalosporins, carbapenems or penicillins (azlocillin, carbenicillin, co-amoxiclav and ticarcillin) with an aminoglycoside].235,238,252,256-259,274\u2013281,311,312 Of these, only two compared the same \u03b2-lactam with and without an aminoglycoside. From the above studies, there is no evidence that clinical or bacteriological response rates can be improved with combination therapy (cephalosporins, carbapenems or penicillins and an aminoglycoside). There is also no evidence that when used in combination with an aminoglycoside, one class of \u03b2-lactam (cephalosporins, carbapenems or penicillins) is more effective than the others in terms of clinical or bacteriological response rates. However, few studies were sufficiently powered to enable superiority to be detected. A systematic review has considered the evidence of monotherapy versus combination therapy in the treatment of non-neutropenic patients with serious infections including pneumonia and found these to be equivalent.313 However, increased incidences of toxicity were observed in patients receiving combination therapy that included an aminoglycoside.",

Compared with a placebo, the bacteriological cure rate was significantly higher in the study group. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the clinical cure rate. In the culture-positive population, the emergence of resistance did not occur more frequently in the study group when compared with the control group. Finally, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of the incidence of adverse reactions, with the exception of a higher frequency of supraventricular tachycardia among patients in the study group. The small sample size and the large number of patients who could not be evaluated are major deficiencies of this study. In a second RCT, tobramycin or placebo was nebulized via ET tubes to patients with VAP; all of the patients were also treated with parenteral antibiotics. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of time to extubation or tolerability. This study suffers from a small sample size.232 A systematic review of patients with CF has demonstrated that aerosolized antipseudomonal antibiotics are associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidences of acute exacerbations.318 The applicability of these findings to patients with VAP is uncertain, but is worthy of further study. The limitations of the existing published trials, together with the absence of other robust evidence, preclude any firm conclusions regarding the efficacy of topical antibiotics as adjunctive therapy in patients with VAP.",

The results confirmed that early discontinuation of empirical therapy was not associated with increased mortality; had a shorter duration of both stay and cost and was associated with lower rates of antibiotic resistance and superinfection. It concluded that a protocol for empirical therapy that guided clinical decision about the duration of therapy based on the CPIS could improve economic and microbiological outcomes without compromising clinical effectiveness. However, the study was not blinded, was primarily in one centre, consisted of mostly elderly men with chronic underlying diseases and was biased by the fact that clinicians began to minimize antibiotic poly-pharmacy and the duration of the therapy in the comparator (standard treatment) arm as the study progressed. This study, therefore, requires validation in different populations and in more severe forms of HAP.",

The study was imbalanced by significant differences in baseline prevalence of co-morbidities such as COPD, congestive cardiac failure and serum albumin and also in differences in other treatments (e.g. dialysis, sucralfate). Following the implementation of VAP guidelines, this study demonstrated improvements in the appropriateness of prescribing (48% to 94%, P > 0.001), a reduction in the duration of antibiotic therapy (14.8\u20138.6 days, P > 0.001) and in subsequent episodes of VAP (24% to 7.7%, P = 0.03). The study did not examine cost-effectiveness or any impact on microbiological outcomes. The poor design of the study and the non-comparability of the patient populations indicate that these data are insufficiently robust to definitively support the implementation of a VAP guideline to improve any of the outcomes defined.331",
