The estimated number of human deaths across Asia and Africa is approximately 59,000, with over 3.7 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 8.6 billion USD economic losses annually [1]. The vast majority of these deaths is in Asia (59.6%). India, with 35% of human rabies deaths, accounted for more deaths than any other country. Rabies is often neglected when health and agriculture (animal health) agenda and budgets are set even if the costs and economic benefits have long been described [2, 3]. It continues to be neglected and very often its public health impact is minimized by other priority infectious diseases like dengue, malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV. Reliable data indicating the actual incidence of human rabies and rabies risk exposures are often lacking or non-existent in many countries, leading to the global number of human deaths that is significantly underreported [3\u20135]. Canine rabies is not only a major burden in endemic countries where thousands of human deaths occur annually, but also in previously rabies-free areas where risks of re-emergence have been increasing over the last decade [6\u201310].",

The strategy describes an integrated One Health approach that brings together the necessary sociocultural, technical, organizational, and political pillars to address this challenge. The ARES was designed to complement the existing subregional frameworks developed to control and eliminate human rabies, such as those developed by the ASEAN Expert Group on Communicable Diseases (AEGCD) in 2010. In South Asia, considering the importance of consolidating achievements in rabies control in Member countries, the WHO Regional Office for Southeast Asia has developed a regional strategy for elimination of human rabies transmitted by dogs (2012) [15].",

Animal rabies control activities vary across the region [17\u201320]. Many national and subnational programs and demonstration projects have proven that proactive mass dog vaccination is much more effective at controlling rabies and less costly than campaigns that vaccinate in response to the occurrence of cases. Control through proactive vaccination followed by two years of continuous monitoring and vaccination should be sufficient to guarantee elimination from any area not subject to repeat introductions [6]. The degree of success of national and global canine rabies elimination efforts, however, depend heavily on effective epidemiological surveillance, which should ensure that intervention impacts can be monitored through time and outbreak responses initiated where necessary. It is recommended that rabies control programs ought to be able to maintain surveillance levels that detect at least 5% (and ideally 10%) of all cases to improve their prospects of eliminating rabies, and this can be achieved through greater intersectoral collaboration [6].",

Working through the lowest unit of a community, the family or household unit, is central, as \u201cmore resilient families are the foundation of more resilient communities.\u201d Individual family units should be fully aware of rabies threats and the required interventions and be the first to take action when these threats appear, such as reporting dog bite incidents to community leaders. The ability of a nation to eliminate rabies starts at household levels\u2014with family members understanding the risks of rabies and being able to systematically mitigate spread, and therefore ensure neighborhood rabies security.

This eventually eased out the production of mammalian nerve tissue-derived vaccines. In the Philippines and Sri Lanka, since mid-1990s, animal bite treatment centers were established in government hospitals and major health facilities [21, 22].

In the Philippines, the integration of rabies education into the school curriculum was initially developed by the Department of Health\u2019s National Rabies Control Program in 2006 [25]. Lesson plans prepared by school teachers integrated facts and figures about rabies, and lessons on responsible pet ownership. Activities for the children involve fun educational events to celebrate the bond between children and pets. The power of the youth must be harnessed.

            "text": "The ASEAN Rabies Elimination Strategy gives particular importance to the organizational and One Health framework for rabies elimination [14]. As an example to understand better, the expansiveness of One Health challenges: In dealing with urban rabies threats, it is recognized that the best single approach is to attack the disease at its source, that is, to eliminate dog-mediated rabies. Eliminating dog rabies greatly reduces the need for postexposure human prophylaxis, at least at some point in time if the process is executed systematically. In this regard, the health sector has been at the forefront of rabies elimination programs. While this traditional principle of rabies elimination is proven to be one of the most well-based and sound of disease control strategies, in reality program implementations are confounded with complexities, resulting in more failures than successes (with only a few established and emerging exemptions). The failures have often been associated with the re-emergence of rabies after it had been temporarily eliminated in the dog population. Even areas (e.g., islands) once rabies-free have encountered emergence and endemic spread of urban rabies [8\u201310]. This has been the general situation for many decades. While the prescribed solution is sound and tested, i.e., elimination of rabies at-source, in the overall process, whole-of-society must deal with the complexities of prevailing urban rabies. Detailed scientific argument is not necessary to point out that poverty is a strong driver of rabies endemicity. For example, the massive proliferation of slum areas is directly proportional to rabies proliferation. The survival priorities of people dictate their health and wellbeing-seeking behaviors; obviously, food and shelter come first to those who are hungry and cold. In the same way, hungry stray dogs seek food and shelter, and the proliferations of garbage and market wastes drive these behaviors. Populations, whose general health and wellbeing are deteriorating, will be further drawn into the state of poverty. Where there are people who (must) eat dogs, there will be those who propagate and market dogs legally or illegally. There are a number of undesirable reasons why dogs are able to cross boundaries and islands. And there will always be bad governance that reciprocate bad community participation/cooperation. Such complexities are too numerous to mention all here but are at the heart of why programs fail. Very similar arguments also apply to the continued proliferation and emergence of other infectious diseases [28]. Most significantly, poverty dynamics clearly drive vulnerabilities to diseases [28\u201330], and these include (1) lack of adequate safe food and water; (2) lack of protection from harm such as exposure to pests, inclement weather, pollution, violence, stress, and disasters; (3) extreme social marginalization and deprivation of opportunities to earn a living, to be educated, to receive healthcare; and (4) infliction of collateral harm, especially to woman and children, the disabled and the elderly. Clearly, the determinants of infectious diseases are multifaceted and increasingly complex [31]. Poverty reduction is central, as generally, Poverty Alleviation means Vulnerability Reduction. This has been documented in relation to the likelihood of infectious diseases emergence in impoverished community settings [32].",

Sustained investment mechanism and integrative efforts must be enabled, for instance, by the designation of a specifically mandated body, e.g., a Rabies or One Health Authority directly under the Office of the President or Prime Minister. Such body could be assigned a czar (secretary or minister level) and a dedicated budget for office and resources. It should be solely focused on rabies elimination (in the meantime), and collaborate as necessary with the health, veterinary, education, environment, industry, and other sectors on clearly defined parameters and terms, with its authority maintained at all levels, i.e., national to local. The structure and mechanism for this could be legislated. Such legislation, together with the creation of the One Health authority, will remain relevant to the continuous prevention, control, and eradication of any zoonoses threat (e.g., Ebola, influenza, SARS, MERS-CoV, malaria, leptospirosis) that potentially are pandemic threats. It is important to recognize the main justification for these radical recommendations which is: any country with a prevailing human rabies threat in this modern and highly connected world is considered a hindrance to global progress.",
