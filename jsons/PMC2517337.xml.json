As expected, the day 7-sacrificed monkey (#4591) had not developed antibodies by the time it was euthanized but #4592 developed antibodies that were detectable by both IFA and NT at day 10 p.i. (Figure 1a,b, Table 1). IHC analysis of the monkey tissues revealed viral antigen in several epithelial cells of the nasal cavity of #4591 and slight histopathological changes in the nasal cavity (Figure 3a,b). Infectious virus and/or virus genome were also detected in the deep and superficial cervical lymph nodes, the mesenteric lymph nodes, and the small and large intestines of this day 7-sacrificed monkey (Table 2). In contrast, virus was not detected in any tissues except in the duodenum from #4592 (sacrificed on day 28 p.i.), and no histopathological changes were observed (Tables 1 and 2). Thus, while i.n. inoculation generates an infection that stimulates an antibody response, lower respiratory tract infection does not occur. Interestingly, however, infectious virus was detected in the lymph nodes and stomach, which suggests that the virus can spread from the nasal cavity to other organs.",

The virus could not spread to the lower respiratory tract upon i.n., i.g. and i.v. inoculation on day 7 p.i., and only i.t. inoculation successfully induced lung lesions on day 7 p.i. (#4589), which were similar to those in SARS patients. Analysis of the i.t.-inoculated animal on day 7 p.i. (#4589) revealed that SARS-CoV replicates in alveolar cells (types 1 and 2), and macrophages, neutrophils and cytokine responses were observed in the lung; these may help form of lung lesions, as postulated for human SARS (Wong et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2004). However, none of the monkeys developed SARS-like signs and symptoms, regardless of the inoculation route. Virus infection, replication and elimination occurred in the respiratory tracts during the 2-week period after inoculation (#4590, #4592 and #4594). The different virological, histopahtological, and immunological results of the two animals in each group (between #4589 and #4590, #4591 and #4592) depended on when the animals were sacrificed after inoculation. These results support previous reports in which monkeys were used for respiratory inoculation (Fouchier et al. 2003; Kuiken et al. 2003; McAuliffe et al. 2004; Rowe et al. 2004; Greenough et al. 2005; Qin et al. 2005). Thus, the model is useful for studying early events in SARS-CoV infection and replication. Additionally, these infected animals showed distinct virological responses depending on the inoculation route. However, the immunological responses such as leucopenia, lymphopenia and T-cell cytokine response such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 were rather similar. These results suggest that these responses play an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV infection.",

Similarly, the i.n.-inoculated animals had infectious virus in their nasal swabs, stomach and deep cervical lymph node, while the i.v.-inoculated animals had infectious virus in their faeces. Thus, after SARS-CoV infection of the respiratory tract, the virus replicates in the nasal cavity epithelium or alveolar epithelium of the lower respiratory tract. The replicated virus is then excreted continuously for several days by the throat or nasal mucosa, after which the virus infects the intestinal and lymphatic systems. Although gastric acid may inactivate the enveloped virus, the infectious virus was nevertheless detected in the intestinal tract of the monkeys regardless of the route of inoculation (Table 2). Thus, it is possible that SARS-CoV viraemia may lead to infection in the intestinal mucosa and replication there that results in the excretion of virus into the faeces. As the infectious virus was also detected in the lymphoid system of the i.t. and i.n. inoculated monkeys (Table 2), it may be the lymphatic system may also play an important role in the spread of the virus within the host.",

Significantly, the i.t.-inoculated monkeys had high IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in the lung and peribronchial lymph node that were probably elicited by activated alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Thus, IL-8/TNF-\u03b1-producing immunological responses may eliminate the virus from the respiratory tract early in infection.
