Respiratory support and high levels of oxygen are required in the acute management of these patients. High Flow Therapies have been included as part of the possible management of COVID-19. 1,2 One such modality is High Flow Therapy, including High Velocity Nasal Insufflation (HVNI), High Flow Oxygen (HFO), and High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC). HVNI shares characteristics with HFNC/HFNO, in that all reliably deliver high flows of oxygen enriched gas at high FiO 2 to the patient via an open nasal interface. High Flow Therapy has demonstrated ability to help manage Hypoxic or Type I Respiratory Failure. 3, 4 All High Flow therapies also share the same issue of potential aerosol generation.",

A Type-I surgical mask surgical mask was modeled over the face. Gaps in the mask/face interface were included to model the effect of poor-fit on a patient: 8 gaps totaling 679mm 2 cross-section were modeled for all experiments (including a gap on both sides of the nose, simulating poor mask fit at the nose). This included 6 gaps and 2 inlets for HVNI cannula tubing. The mask was modeled to match EN14683 standards. HVNI therapy was modeled from CT-derived architecture of a petite adult female, sinusoidal breathing a 500ml tidal volume at 32 breaths per minute and a 1:1 Inspiratory/expiratory ratio (the exaggerated tidal volume was intentional to model 'worst-case' expiratory flow and velocity). HVNI flow was modeled at 40 LPM through a model of Vapotherm Adult Small/Pediatric cannula. Low Flow Oxygen delivery was modeled using a similar cannula delivering 6 L\u2022min -1 continuous flow (LFO 2 ). A third scenario of 'No-Therapy' on a patient breathing with the same dynamics was modeled for comparison.",

The model used a single particle generation rate across all scenarios. Particle mass disposition is reported as a proportion, as actual volume of particulate generation in patients will vary. The second experiment was performed using a different simulation, evaluating CO 2 flush, performed using a CT-derived anatomically accurate model of a petite adult airway and face. The model assumed exhalation of 8% CO 2 , HVNI delivered at 40L\u2022min -1 via a Vapotherm Adult Small/Pediatric cannula.

The intentional leak points showed greater leak with HVNI than LFO 2 or No Therapy (16.5% v 12.6% v 11.6% leak respectively).

The greater HVNI capture is likely due to the rapid incorporation of high velocity particles into the mask material, as compared to the lower velocity LFO 2 therapy gas stream. The minority of particles (15.9%) which escaped the HVNI simulation showed travel length of greater than 1m as compared to 6.9% on LFO 2 . This was overwhelmingly attributed to mask leak.
