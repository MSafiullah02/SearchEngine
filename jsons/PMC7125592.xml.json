It is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with a size of approximately 80\u2013160 nm in diameter and 20 nm-long club-shaped projections around virions. Its genome is linear, positive sense, single stranded RNA. The major structural proteins of TCoV include the glycoprotein spike (S1 and S2), a membrane (M) protein and a nucleocapsid (N) protein. The S protein is highly variable and the spike gene structure remains unclear, despite several genetic studies of TCoV having been conducted [5]. The amino terminal S1 region of several coronaviruses contains receptor binding domains, whereas the S2 region consists of a transmembrane domain that induces cell fusion and pathogenesis [6]. In addition, the S2 gene is more conserved and shares only 40% of similarity with other coronaviruses such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [5], [6].",

This TCoV strain was successfully propagated in embryonated turkey eggs supplied for a commercial hatchery [8]. Viral purification, RNA isolation and subsequent RT-PCR amplification were carried out using a pooled intestinal tissue suspension of infected intestines harvested from inoculated embryos, as in our previous study [8]. The virus titration was performed with 10-fold dilutions into five groups of five 28-day-old embryonated turkey eggs. The 50% embryos infectious dose (EID50) was calculated according to Reed and Muench (1938) by analyzing macroscopic lesions in the intestinal tract [7], [8]. Intestinal tissues infected at a 2.0 \u00d7 104 EID50 titer were homogenized in a 2-fold volume of minimal essential medium (GIBCO-BRL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), clarified by centrifugation at 2500 \u00d7 g for 20 min and filtered consecutively through 0.45-\u03bcm and 0.22-\u03bcm membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The presence of TCoV in the filtrate was confirmed using RT-PCR of a portion of the 3\u2032UTR (untranslated) region [2]. Extensive testing of the inoculums excluded the presence of pathogens other than TCoV.",

A control group of 20 turkey embryos at the same age were inoculated with sterile phosphate buffered solution (PBS).

IFA was performed in tissue sections, as described previously [8] in order to detect viral antigens along the cell surface. Intestinal suspensions (IS) were prepared by cutting slices from the ileum and ileum\u2013caecal junctions from a total of 25 samples collected from infected and 20 from uninfected embryos.

Amplification was carried out at 64 \u00b0C for 45 min or 75 min and terminated by incubation at 80 \u00b0C for 2 min. The products of the reaction were inspected by eye following the addition of 1 \u03bcl hydroxynaphthol blue (Sigma\u2013Aldrich\u00ae). All samples were also tested by conventional RT-PCR, as described previously [9]. Each assay was conducted in triplicate. A positive amplification was indicated by a color change from violet to sky blue, as shown in Fig. 1A, and verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). The detection limit of RT-LAMP and conventional RT-PCR is illustrated in Fig. 1B and C. Ten-fold serial dilution of TCoV demonstrated that RT-LAMP is able to detect 102 EID50/50 \u03bcl, whereas the RT-PCR is able to detect 104 EID50/50 \u03bcl titrated virus.",

A number of 25 ileum\u2013caecal junction samples from the 25 infected embryos 13 were scored as negative for TCoV infection with IFA (Table 2\n). These false negative results were likely observed because viral antigens are not normally expressed on the cell surface until after viral RNA transcription [6]. When conventional RT-PCR and RT-LAMP performed in the same samples were directly compared, 14 ileum\u2013caecal junction samples negative by RT-PCR were negative by IFA and 5 samples were considered negative with conventional RT-PCR (Table 3\n). This phenomenon could be explained by properties of DNA polymerization offered by the use of four primers in LAMP assay which can amplify few amounts of viral RNA into cDNA [11]. Probably those negative samples generated in conventional RT-PCR were collected from low viral infection samples with titers lower than 104 EID50/50 \u03bcl and not visualized on agarose gel electrophoresis system [12]. All negative samples collected from non-infected embryos were negative in all tests (data not shown). A perfect correlation was found between conventional RT-PCR and RT-LAMP results for feces collected in the field (Table 3). No false positives (i.e., cross-reaction) of TCoV RT-LAMP were detected in samples of other avian viruses (Fig. 1B).",

One of the most attractive features of this RT-LAMP assay is that the results can be observed and determined by hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) dye-mediated visualization using the naked eye; furthermore, tubes do not have to be opened after amplification. The results reported here indicate that this diagnostic technique could reliably be used to detect TCoV in field samples and may be used to effectively monitor infections, as demonstrated previously for real-time RT-PCR for the same target gene [4]. Although no quantitative data was generated in this study, RT-LAMP associated with spectrophotometric evaluation can yield absolute values, as demonstrated previously [12], [13], [14].",
