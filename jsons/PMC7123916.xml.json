            "text": "MV outbreaks usually occur in late winter/early spring, and transmission is via aerosolized droplets (Hayward 1826; Rall 2003). MV is one of the most highly contagious infectious agents, and outbreaks can occur in populations in which less than 10 % of individuals are susceptible. Before the introduction of measles vaccine, over 90 % of persons would become immune by age 15 as a result of naturally acquired infection. The 1933 studies of Hedrich in Baltimore showed that measles epidemics were related to small fluctuations in the susceptible population under the age of 15 years of age. Epidemics occurred when the susceptible population reached 45\u201350 % and ceased when the levels were reduced to 30\u201335 %. A level of herd immunity protected the population from epidemics when it reached 65 % of the children under age 15, but it guaranteed a reservoir of susceptible individuals for endemic measles (Schaffner et al. 1968). It is estimated that 90 % of nonimmune people exposed to an infected individual will become infected. Moreover, infected individuals are contagious for 3\u20134 days before and after the appearance of the characteristic rash, increasing the risk of transmission. The contagiousness of MV is best expressed by the basic reproductive number (Ro), which is the mean number of secondary cases that would arise if an infectious agent were introduced into a completely susceptible population. The estimated Ro for MV is generally assumed to be 12\u201318, in contrast to only 5\u20137 for smallpox virus and 2\u20133 for SARS coronavirus (Rima and Duprex 2006; Monto 1998; Moss and Griffin 2006). The high infectivity of MV implies that a high level of population immunity (approximately 95 %) is required to interrupt MV transmission (Monto 1998). The virus remains transmissible in the air or on infected surfaces for up to 2 h, obviating the need for direct person-to-person contact (Monto 1998).",

During the incubation period MV replicates and spreads in the infected host. Type 1 pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, and respiratory epithelial cells become infected but is yet unknown which is the initial site of viral replication. The virus then spreads to local lymphatic tissue, and this replication is followed by viremia and dissemination to many organs, including the lymph nodes, skin, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and liver, in which the virus replicates in the epithelial and endothelial cells and in lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages (Griffin 2010). Measles immunity involves humoral, cellular, and mucosal responses. Cell-mediated immunity is required for recovery from measles, and humoral immunity is associated with protection from infection or reinfection (Moss and Griffin 2012).",

Patients with measles showed suppressed delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to recall antigens, such as tuberculin, and impaired cellular and humoral responses to new antigens. This MV-induced immune suppression renders individuals more susceptible to secondary bacterial and viral infections that can cause pneumonia and diarrhea and is responsible for much of the measles-related morbidity and mortality (Moss and Griffin 2006). Pneumonia, the most common fatal complication of measles, occurs in 56\u201386 % of measles-related deaths (Duke and Mgone 2003). The production of IL-12 is reduced while the production of IL-10, which inhibits DTH responses and downregulates the synthesis of cytokines and suppresses macrophage activation and T-cell proliferation, is elevated for several weeks in the plasma of children with measles (Yanagi et al. 2006). The measles skin rash is thought to be caused by the T-cell response to MV-infected cells in capillary vessels because it does not appear in children with T-cell immunodeficiency (Yanagi et al. 2006).",

Acute otitis media is the most common complication, and pneumonia is the most common cause of death in measles. Croup, tracheitis, and bronchiolitis are common complications in infants and toddlers with measles (Moss and Griffin 2012; Duke and Mgone 2003; Perry and Halsey 2004). Pneumonia is a severe complication of measles and as noted accounts for most measles-associated deaths. In studies of unselected hospitalized children with measles, 55 % had radiographic changes of bronchopneumonia, consolidation, or other infiltrates; 77 % of children with severe disease and 41 % of children with mild disease had radiographic changes. In recent years, pneumonia was present in 9 % of children <5 years old with measles in the United States, in 0\u20138 % of cases during outbreaks, and in 49\u201357 % of adults.",

Studies that included culture of blood, lung punctures, or tracheal aspirations revealed bacteria as the cause of 25\u201335 % of measles-associated pneumonia.

Other bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and E. coli) are less common causes of severe pneumonia associated with measles. In studies of young adult military recruits with pneumonia associated with measles, Neisseria meningitidis was a probable cause in some cases (Perry and Halsey 2004; Enders et al. 1959; Mitus et al. 1959; Ellison 1931). Diarrhea and vomiting are common symptoms associated with acute measles; appendicitis may occur from obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by lymphoid hyperplasia.

The three most serious complications of measles occur in the CNS. These are acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE); the last two are invariably fatal. ADEM develops a week after the appearance of the rash and is seen in 1:100 infected children. Approximately 15 % of patients with ADEM die, and 20\u201340 % suffer long-term sequelae, including mental retardation, motor disabilities, and deafness. MIBE is seen in immunocompromised patients between 2 and 6 months after acute infection or vaccination. SSPE is caused by a persistent measles virus infection and develops years after the initial infection (Rima and Duprex 2006; Perry and Halsey 2004).

Here we turn attention to the pneumonitis caused by the measles virus. Changes in the lung include peribronchial and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates, squamous metaplasia of bronchial epithelium, proliferation of Type II pneumocytes, and formation of hyaline membranes, the latter changes indicative of diffuse alveolar damage. Complicated cases may evolve into abscess formation and empyema. The prototypical pulmonary change however is the development of multinucleated giant cells with characteristic nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 8.3). These cells, which have also been reported in various lymphoreticular tissues throughout the body, are typically large and contain from a few nuclei to too numerous to count. Absence of such multinucleated giant cells in the lung may occur and should not be regarded as exclusionary evidence of measles pneumonia. Conversely, the presence of such multinucleated giant cells is not diagnostic of measles pneumonia. A giant cell pneumonia-like picture may be seen in a variety of granulomatous disorders, but more importantly giant cell pneumonia can be a manifestation of other viral pneumonias. These include cases of giant cell pneumonia secondary to respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, and the Nipah viruses, the latter less likely since it is not known to occur in Europe or the United States. Viral inclusions are also found in pneumonia due to herpes simplex, herpes zoster and adenovirus, and other viral infections but are morphologically different and generally do not represent a diagnostic problem (Zaki and Paddock 2008; Radoycich et al. 1992).\n\n",

This format requires the blockage of IgG antibodies and rheumatoid factor through a pretreatment step to ensure optimal performance. IgM assays based on the capture format have been developed for measles (WHO 2007; Moss and Griffin 2012).

Since 1963 a killed virus vaccine (Edmonston A) and a live attenuated vaccine (Edmonston B) were introduced for use globally (Markowitz et al. 1990). The killed vaccine was not used after 1967 because of its incomplete protection (MMWR 2008).

Thanks to the use of measles vaccine, measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, although sporadic cases continue to occur owing to importation (Enders et al. 1959).

The MMRV vaccine may be administered simultaneously with other vaccines recommended for children aged 12\u201315 months and 4\u20136 years. If simultaneous administration is not possible, MMRV vaccine may be administered at any time before or after an inactivated vaccine but at least 28 days before or after another live, attenuated vaccine, except varicella vaccine, for which a minimum interval of 3 months is recommended. Live attenuated virus vaccines are contraindicated in patients with altered immunity (i.e., blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system); primary or acquired immunodeficiency including HIV infections/AIDS, cellular immune deficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia, and dysgammaglobulinemia; family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiencies, unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient has been demonstrated; systemic immunosuppressive therapy, including oral steroids \u22652 mg/kg of body weight or \u226520 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for persons who weigh >10 kg, when administered for \u22652 weeks; and pregnancy (MMWR 2008). Measles immunization is not contraindicated in children with HIV infection who are not severely immunocompromised (Am Acad of Ped 2009).",

Despite the availability of effective live vaccines, the disease is still responsible for 4 % of diseases in children younger than 5 years of age worldwide. The virus is transmitted via respiratory droplets delivering infectious particles to epithelial cells of the respiratory tract of susceptible nests. Pneumonia is a major complication, characterized in part by the presence of multinucleated giant cells. The differential diagnosis includes giant cell pneumonia due to parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus among others. An effective vaccine is available and was helpful to declare measles elimination in the United States in 2000. However, sporadic cases continue to occur owing to failure to seek vaccination in selected population groups.",
