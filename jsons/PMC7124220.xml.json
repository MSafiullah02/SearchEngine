Health care-acquired respiratory viral infections were defined as a positive nasopharyngeal respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction panel (detects respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus), respiratory syncytial virus antigen, or influenza A or B antigen obtained on or after hospital day 5 in a child without a previous positive test either during or in the 30 days preceding his or her hospitalization. Positive tests obtained before hospital day 3 were defined as infections present on admission. Testing obtained between hospital day 3 and 5 were excluded to account for incubating viruses present on admission. Of note, no viral surveillance screening programs exist at CCHMC; all testing performed is at clinicians' discretion guided by clinical symptoms. No additional infection control interventions directed against respiratory pathogen transmission were implemented between the pre- and postintervention seasons.",

The postintervention respiratory season was milder, particularly for influenza, as illustrated by national surveillance data as well as the reduced number of children with positive admission tests that may have overestimated the effectiveness of the visitor restriction policy changes in both the ICU and non-ICU floors.10 When excluding influenza testing, the incidence rate remained decreased on the non-ICU floors, although the effect size was not significant.",

These findings can be used to guide institutional visitor restriction policies and to help convey to families and other visitors the potential risks of respiratory viral transmission within the hospital during periods of high community prevalence. Prospective controlled studies involving the collection of samples from both patients and bedside visitors are needed to more completely assess the role that visitors play in transmission of viral infections in hospitalized children.",
