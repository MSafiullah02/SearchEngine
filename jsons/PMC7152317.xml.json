It infects domestic and wild cats worldwide, as well as hyenas.4 Like HIV, FIV establishes a chronic, persistent infection that, in some cats, ultimately culminates in immunodeficiency. Because of its similarities to HIV, FIV infection in cats has been used as a research model for HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),5 and relative to other viral infections of companion animals, much is known about its pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Knowledge of retroviral structure and replication is required in order to understand diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies that target these viruses. Like other retroviruses, FIV has a three-layered structure that is composed of an innermost genome-nucleocapsid complex with helical symmetry, an icosahedral capsid, and an envelope with glycoprotein spikes (Figure 21-1\n). The FIV genome contains three major genes: gag, which encodes the virion core proteins (capsid [p24], nucleocapsid, and matrix); pol, which encodes the reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase enzymes; and env, which encodes surface (gp120) and transmembrane virion (gp41) envelope glycoproteins. Several other accessory and regulatory genes are also present. FIV invades cells via the primary receptor CD134, which is expressed on feline CD4+ T cells, B cells, and activated macrophages,6., 7. and the secondary receptor CXCR4, which is normally a chemokine receptor. The viral envelope fuses with the cell membrane, and the capsid enters the cytoplasm, where reverse transcription occurs and a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) copy of the retroviral genome is made. Additional sequences, known as long terminal repeats (LTRs), are added to either end of the viral genome. The virus then passes into the nucleus where the dsDNA copy integrates into the host genome; at this point the integrated dsDNA becomes a provirus. Transcription of this DNA, which is controlled by the LTRs, leads to synthesis of new virion components, and virus assembly and budding occur at the cell surface (Figure 21-2\n). Depending on the cellular environment, proviral DNA may either be latent, whereby transcription does not occur, or be transcriptionally active. Latency is one mechanism by which retroviruses can evade the host immune system. Because the reverse transcriptase enzyme is prone to error, the mutation rate of retroviruses is high, and a diversity of viral variants continuously emerges from infected hosts. Integration of retroviral DNA into host cell DNA can disrupt genes that are responsible for cell growth and differentiation (proto-oncogenes). Alternatively, cellular oncogenes captured and carried by retroviruses develop mutations during retroviral replication, and are then re-inserted into host cell DNA. The end result is abnormal cell growth and differentiation, which results in tumor formation by some retroviruses.",

Being of mixed breed has also been a risk factor in some studies. The mean age at diagnosis is around 6 to 8 years, and 80% to 90% of cats are more than 2 years of age.

A study that included more than 18,000 North American cats estimated the overall prevalence of FeLV and FIV infections as around 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively.5 Higher prevalences are found in feral and free-ranging cats and sick cats. In the North American study, the prevalence of FIV infection in sick, feral cats was 18.2%, whereas that in healthy indoor cats was only 0.7%. A study from France showed a seroprevalence of 21% in unowned cats, compared with 10% in owned cats.43 In Japan, the overall seroprevalence is very high (23% in one study), and as many as one-third of male cats test positive.12 Occasionally, co-infections with FeLV occur, and infection with one retrovirus is a risk factor for infection with the other.36., 37.\n",

After inoculation, the virus replicates in lymphoid tissues, and high concentrations of virus are present in blood 2 weeks after infection. A peak of viremia occurs 8 to 12 weeks after infection (Figure 21-3\n). There is a decline in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. This may be associated with transient illness, which lasts 3 to 6 months and is often unrecognized by cat owners. Some cats show lethargy, fever, anorexia, diarrhea, stomatitis, weight loss, and/or lymphadenopathy during the acute phase. Lymphadenopathy results from lymphoid hyperplasia, and can persist for weeks to months. Neutropenia can also occur,44 possibly as a result of neutrophil apoptosis. CD4+/CD25+ T regulator (Treg) cells are infected and activated during the acute phase. These cells then inhibit the proliferation of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and cause them to undergo apoptosis. This may contribute to persistence of FIV and further immunosuppression.45., 46., 47. Altered dendritic cell function may also occur.48., 49. In general, impaired T cell function in acute infection is thought to result from cytokine dysregulation, immunologic anergy (failure to respond to specific antigens), and increased apoptosis.45 Nevertheless, most cats survive this phase because of a rebound in CD8+ T cell numbers and a strong humoral immune response.\n",

Cats remain subclinically infected, often for years or even for life. This is not latent infection, because virus production continues at low levels; a slow, progressive decline in CD4+ T cell numbers; reduction in the CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratio; and in some cats, hyperglobulinemia, which results from B cell hyperactivation. Some studies also describe a sustained increase in CD8+ T cell numbers. Although activated, paradoxically, T cells have a reduced ability to respond to antigenic stimulation. Altered lymphocyte expression of cell surface molecules (including CD4 and cytokine receptors, and MHC II antigens), and continued alteration of dendritic cell and neutrophil function also contribute to immunosuppression. Dysregulation of cytokine production occurs. For example, cats that are chronically infected with FIV fail to produce Il-2, Il-6, and Il-12 in response to Toxoplasma gondii infection and instead produce elevated levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine Il-10.45., 50. There is a slow influx of immune cells into the brain, with gradual progression of central nervous system (CNS) disease.51 The rate of progression of the subclinical phase depends on factors such as the virus strain, co-infections with other agents that activate virus transcription, and host immunity.",

The terminal phase of FIV infection is commonly associated with moderate to severe periodontal disease, lymphoplasmacytic stomatitis (Figure 21-4\n), gingivitis, and feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions,52 which may result from opportunistic bacterial and viral infections. Other opportunistic infections include chronic bacterial skin and ear infections, persistent viral upper respiratory tract infections, dermatophytosis, mycobacterial infections, fungal infections such as cryptococcosis and sporotrichosis, hemoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and/or parasitic infections such as demodecosis and severe flea burdens. With the exception of stomatitis, the relationship between many of these opportunistic infections and FIV infection is somewhat unclear, because the prevalence of many of these infections in cats with FIV infection is similar to that in cats without FIV infection.

Other tumors include mast cell tumors, fibrosarcomas, meningiomas, and metastatic carcinomas; some infected cats develop more than one type of neoplasia.

Provided there has not been a history of vaccination for FIV and the tested cat is less than 6 months of age, positive antibody test results equate with infection, because the virus establishes a lifelong, persistent infection. Point-of-care, lateral-flow ELISA assays and diagnostic laboratory-based ELISA assays are in widespread use and have rapid turnaround times and high sensitivities and specificities.70 These assays usually detect antibodies to the FIV p24 core protein, and sometimes to the gp40 transmembrane protein. False positive test results occur rarely as a result of operator error or nonspecific reactivity against tissue culture components after vaccination.71 When Western immunoblotting was used as the gold standard, the sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values of six different ELISA assays (Synbiotics Witness, Viracheck FIV, IDEXX SNAP Combo Plus, PetChek Plus Anti-FIV, MegaCor Fastest, and Bio Veto Duo Speed) in one U.S. study of 535 cats with an overall FIV seroprevalence of 10.3% ranged from 94.5% to 100%, 98.5% to 100%, 91.2% to 100%, and 99.2% to 100%, respectively.70 The Mapic FIV test had a high (23.1%) rate of invalid test results and was not recommended for clinical practice. When these assays are used to screen healthy cats for infection, confirmation of positive results is recommended because of the low prevalence of infection in this population of cats and the higher possibility that false-positive test results may occur. Confirmation can be done using an assay from a different manufacturer or Western blotting. However, Western blotting is technically demanding, subject to interoperator variability in interpretation, and it may be less sensitive than ELISA assays when performed by some laboratories.72\n",

Kittens that test positive should be retested after 6 months of age (the Advisory Bureau on Cat Diseases recommends retesting after 4 months of age).66., 73. Nevertheless, kittens less than 6 months of age should still be tested, because the vast majority of negative kittens will be declared free of infection. Molecular testing could be considered to confirm infection in kittens that test positive at less than 6 months of age (see later discussion). Cats with a history of FIV vaccination may remain antibody-positive for more than 4 years.66 Because infection can occur in the face of vaccination, positive test results in a vaccinated cat may represent infection and/or historical vaccination. Currently, molecular testing with PCR assays is required to identify infection in these cats, but some infected cats test PCR-negative. An ELISA assay has been developed that can distinguish naturally infected from vaccinated cats, but this assay is not commercially available.

Assays may detect viral RNA (reverse transcriptase [RT]-PCR), proviral DNA, or both RNA and proviral DNA in peripheral blood. Because the FIV vaccine is inactivated and does not replicate or integrate into the host genome, PCR assays should not detect vaccine virus in cats that have been vaccinated for FIV. Compared with serology, PCR can be insensitive (sensitivity <80%), because viral loads in healthy cats are often extremely low, and some strains may not be detected because of variability in the sequence of the viral genome among FIV isolates. Sensitivity is likely to be higher in cats in the acute and terminal phases of disease when viral loads are higher, but this requires further study. False-positive test results have the potential to occur as a result of laboratory contamination; in some commercial laboratories, unacceptable sensitivities and specificities have been reported (as low as 41% and 44%, respectively).74., 75. In advertising materials, IDEXX Laboratories report an assay sensitivity and specificity of 80.5% and 99.9%, respectively, among 36 FIV-infected cats, 96 uninfected vaccinated cats and 92 uninfected unvaccinated cats, with no difference in specificity in the latter two groups.76 A FRET real-time PCR assay directed at the gag gene has been described that differentiates between FIV subtypes (see Chapter 5 for an explanation of FRET PCR assays).11 The assay was positive in 60% of 101 cats with positive antibody tests for FIV. A history of vaccination with the FIV vaccine was present in 13 of the cats, and all these cats tested negative. The vaccination history of the remaining cats was unknown. Given their limitations, PCR assays should not be used for diagnosis of FIV infection in the absence of concurrent serologic testing, and the results of PCR assays should not be used to decide whether vaccination should be performed. Cats that are seronegative that test positive with PCR may be in the terminal phase of disease and unable to produce antibody, or the PCR assay result may be a false positive. Latently infected cats have rarely been described that test positive for proviral DNA but negative for antibody.76 These cats lack any immunologic or clinical abnormalities that occur with active infection.76 Whether these cats are likely to develop productive infection (as reported in humans with latent HIV infection) is unknown.77\n",

Whole mouth extractions have been beneficial for some cats with severe stomatitis, but it is critical that all tooth roots be removed. Referral to a board-certified veterinary dentist should be considered. Topical glucocorticoids (e.g., 1% prednisolone acetate, every 4 to 12 hours depending on severity) and topical atropine are indicated for cats with anterior uveitis. Systemic glucocorticoids should only be used if absolutely necessary, because their use is associated with increased plasma viremia. Some cats with advanced neurologic signs show clinical improvement after treatment with glucocorticoids. Opportunistic infections may respond to appropriate antimicrobial treatment, but prolonged or lifelong treatment may be required. Griseofulvin should not be used to treat dermatophytosis, because it has been associated with bone marrow suppression in FIV-positive cats.79 Recombinant human erythropoietin or darbepoetin may be useful for some cats with nonregenerative anemia and does not appear to increase viral load through activation of transcription of latent virus.80 Although recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) can increase neutrophil counts in cats infected with FIV, antibodies can develop within a few weeks that cross-react with endogenous G-CSF. When recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was used, an increase in virus load occurred, so the use of these drugs is not recommended.",

A complete physical examination, CBC, serum biochemistry panel, and urinalysis are recommended on an annual basis.66 At least during acute FIV infection, cats can mount an immune response to vaccines,85., 86. but because vaccination with core vaccines may activate viral transcription, vaccination should be performed only for FIV-positive cats that are likely to be exposed to other cats. The use of inactivated vaccines is recommended, because of the potential for vaccine-induced disease in immunosuppressed cats.73 When hospitalized, FIV-infected cats should be kept in separate cages away from isolation, where there may be other cats with transmissible infectious diseases.

The vaccine has been available in New Zealand and Australia since 2004. It is licensed for the vaccination of healthy cats that are 8 weeks of age or older as an aid in the prevention of FIV, and in experimental challenge studies, protected 60% to 80% of cats from infection. The introduction of the vaccine generated controversy, because (1) existing serologic assays cannot differentiate between natural infection and vaccination, (2) vaccination provides only partial protection from infection, and (3) PCR assay results cannot be relied upon in vaccinated cats. Although concerns exist that the vaccine may only protect against infection with strains from homologous subtypes, studies have shown moderate protection against infection with subtype B strains.90., 91.

The initial vaccine should only be given to cats that test negative with FIV ELISA assays. Cat owners should be informed that protection is incomplete and that identification of subsequent infection may be impossible in some cats with the available diagnostic tests. The initial vaccine dose is followed by two booster doses at 3- to 4-week intervals, followed by annual boosters so long as risk persists. An identification microchip should be placed that links FIV vaccination to the microchip number, so should the cat escape or be relinquished to a shelter, a positive antibody test result is not interpreted as FIV infection.",

Physical examination was unremarkable. Blood work showed a hematocrit of 28% (reference range, 29% to 38%), a white cell count of 6400 cells/\u00b5L with a normal differential, clumped platelets, mild hyperbilirubinemia (0.5 mg/dL), mild hypoalbuminemia (2.4 g/dL), and hyperglobulinemia (5.5 g/dL). He was treated with amoxicillin and mirtazapine, but lethargy and inappetence persisted. Serial hemograms performed over the subsequent 3 months showed progressive leukopenia due to a neutropenia and lymphopenia (Table 21-6\n), during which time Arthur was treated with orbifloxacin, with some improvement in his appetite and attitude. A bone marrow aspirate performed 5 weeks after the onset of illness showed myeloid hyperplasia with a left shift. Serology for FIV and FeLV was performed 11 weeks after onset of illness, and the cat was negative for FeLV antigen and had an equivocal test result for FIV antibody. Serum thyroxine concentration was low (0.7 mcg/dL, reference range 1.1 to 3.3 mcg/dL). The cat was referred for further evaluation.Arthur was an indoor and outdoor cat and had a history of predation (mice and birds) and fighting with other cats in the neighborhood. His diet otherwise consisted of a commercial wet cat food. He was vaccinated regularly for rabies, FeLV, feline herpesvirus-1, feline calicivirus, and feline panleukopenia virus infections.Current MedicationsOrbifloxacin, 7 mg/kg PO q12hOther Medical HistoryRoutine blood work had been performed 3 years previously, which showed a normal CBC, a globulin of 5 g/dL, a urine specific gravity of 1.069, and a T4 of 1.3. At that time, Arthur tested negative for FeLV antigen and positive for FIV antibody.Physical ExaminationBody Weight3.1 kgGeneralQuiet, alert, responsive, estimated to be 5% to 7% dehydrated, T = 103.9\u00b0 F (39.9\u00b0 C), HR = 144 beats/min, RR = 50 breaths/min, mucous membranes pale pink, CRT < 2 s. A dry haircoat with moderate amounts of scale was present. There was no evidence of ectoparasites.Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat (with Dilated Fundoscopic Examination)Moderate gingivitis and absent mandibular canine teeth. No other clinically significant abnormalities were detected.MusculoskeletalBody condition score 2/9. Generalized muscle atrophy was noted. Ambulatory in all four limbs.CardiovascularAside from an intermittent gallop rhythm, no abnormalities were noted.RespiratoryNo abnormalities were detected.Gastrointestinal and UrogenitalAbdomen soft and nonpainful on palpation, mild hepatomegaly.

There was mild enlargement of the ileocecal lymph nodes and mild diffuse thickening of the small intestinal submucosal layer.Thoracic RadiographsCardiopulmonary structures were within normal limits.Cytologic FindingsLiver Aspiration CytologyA moderately bloody background contained scattered, variably sized clusters of uniform hepatocytes and low numbers of nucleated cells. The nucleated cells consisted of a mixture of nondegenerate neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and rare myeloid precursors. Several macrophages were erythrophagic. Interpretation: Possible mild myeloid extramedullary hematopoiesis.Spleen Aspiration CytologyThe specimen was highly cellular with a pink background that contained a moderate amount of blood and scattered clumps of hemosiderin. A mixed population of lymphocytes was admixed with variable numbers of hematopoietic precursor cells. Hematopoietic precursors were primarily granulocytic precursors, with many progranulocytes. A few erythroid precursors, including erythroblasts, were noted. Plasma cells were moderately increased in number, and both immature and mature forms were seen. Several binucleated and rare trinucleated plasma cells and scattered immature lymphocytes were noted. Vacuolated macrophages were increased in number and often contained phagocytized erythrocytes or blue-green pigment consistent with hemosiderin. Scattered mitotic figures were noted. Interpretation: Moderate plasmacytosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and histiocytic hyperplasia with erythrophagocytosis and increased iron. The large number of immature plasma cells raised the possibility of plasma cell neoplasia; however, reactive plasmacytosis could not be ruled out.Bone Marrow Aspiration CytologyNumerous hypercellular unit particles were present. A few mature megakaryocytes were noted. Hematopoietic cells consisted largely of myeloid precursors, with an estimated myeloid to erythroid ratio greater than 10. Myeloid cells showed orderly maturation to the band neutrophil stage, with few segmented neutrophils. Few erythroid precursors were noted, which included rare prorubricytes, rubricytes, and metarubricytes. Scattered well-differentiated plasma cells and a small amount of hemosiderin were noted. Interpretation: Marked myeloid hyperplasia, marked erythroid hypoplasia, and moderate megakaryocytic hypoplasia. The myeloid hyperplasia together with persistent neutropenia suggested myelodysplasia.Serum Protein ElectrophoresisA mild increase in \u03b12 globulins was present (1.34 g/dL, reference range, 0.4-0.9 g/dL) together with a broad-based gamma region. This was consistent with an acute-phase inflammatory response.DiagnosisTerminal phase of FIV infection, characterized by pancytopenia secondary to myelodysplasia; hepatopathy (open diagnosis).CommentsThe progression of FIV infection was apparent in this cat, which transitioned from a seropositive to a seronegative, PCR-positive state as a result of progressive decline in immune function and, ultimately, failure to produce antibodies. The cause of the hepatopathy was not identified. Blood cultures were negative, and spleen and liver aspiration cytology failed to reveal evidence of underlying neoplasia. Because of the plasmacytosis in the spleen, serum protein electrophoresis was performed to assist diagnosis of a plasma cell tumor (as supported by a monoclonal gammopathy), but this was not apparent. The cat was treated with clavulanic acid\u2013amoxicillin without clinical improvement. Treatment with glucocorticoids was also offered because of the possibility of undiagnosed round cell neoplasia or immune-mediated neutropenia (in light of the myeloid hyperplasia combined with a positive antinuclear antibody test). The cat died at home 1 month later, and necropsy was not performed.\n",
