In vitro experiments showed that hydroxychloroquine reduced the expression of vascular cell 10 adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and IL-1\u03b2 and attenuates the suppression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) in human aortic endothelial cells.10    However, even though chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are relatively well tolerated, several adverse effects (including QT prolongation) limit its clinical use for COVID-19 patients, especially for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. 10, 35-37 These findings suggest that hydroxychloroquine have both anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity for COVID-19 therapy but its safety and efficacy needs to be tested in large-scale randomized control trials. In addition, niclosamide, an FDA-approved drug for treatment of tapeworm infestation, was recently identified to have a stronger inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV-2 at sub-micromolar (IC50 = 0.28 \u00b5M). Gassen et al. showed that niclosamide inhibited SKP2 activity by enhancing autophagy and reducing MERS-CoV replication as well.38 Altogether, niclosamide offers another promising drug candidate for COVID-19, which is warranted to be investigated in randomized controlled trials further.Finally, given the up-regulation of systemic inflammation-in some cases culminating to a cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 patients 40 -combination therapy with an agent targeting inflammation (melatonin or indomethacin) and with direct antiviral effects (toremifene and niclosamide) has the potential of leading to successful treatments.Discussion11As COVID-19 patients flood hospitals worldwide, physicians are trying to search effective antiviral therapies to save lives.
