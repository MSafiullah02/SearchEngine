Under continuous effect of acute IR, DSBs occur within the cell, and trigger the binding of the sensor protein kinase ATM to the nascent DNA ends, consequently increase the kinase activity of ATM (Li et al., 2001). As an important transcription factor within nuclear, P53 can be activated by DNA damage transferring through ATM activation. By regulating downstream genes and their signal pathways, active P53 further induce cell cycle arrest to repair DNA damage and cell apoptosis to eliminate the abnormal cells with genome damage or deregulated proliferation. Especially, these functional properties may modulate the activity of certain anticancer agents (Ritter et al., 2002, Pauklin et al., 2005).",

These approaches provide a good link between the diverging areas of biomedicine and mathematics (Chou, 2004, Chou and Zhou, 1982). Recently, some models have been proposed to simulate the kinetics of tumor therapy at cellular level (Ding et al., 2006). Especially, several models have been proposed to explain the damped oscillations of P53 in cell populations (Qi et al., in press-a, Qi et al., in press-b, Ma et al., 2005, Bar-Or et al., 2000). However, under radiotherapy, the cellular response mechanisms in fighting against genome stresses and the complicated regulations among vital genes need to be further addressed.",

In our simulations, the dynamic regulations among DSB-protein complexes (DSBCs), ATM, P53, and MDM2, as well as the kinetics of toxins eliminating triggered by active P53 (P53#) are presented under continuous effect of acute IR, here we use the superscript # to represent the activate state.

The second part is ATM activation module. Followed the transferring of DSBCs signal from damage sites, ATM is activated rapidly with the cooperation of DSBCs and positive self-feedback of active ATM (ATM#).

P53 is activated rapidly followed the increase of ATM# within the cell (Bar-Or et al., 2000; Banin et al., 1998) and subsequently regulate its downstream genes and signal pathways to induce cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis, controlling the process of DNA damage repair, and abnormal cells apoptosis (Weller, 1998, Ritter et al., 2002).

As a result, MDM2, a P53-specific ligase and antagonist of P53 (Ma et al., 2005), is prompted by the increase of P53#. Reversely, P53 is depressed by the increase of MDM2 protein (MDM2p). This negative feedback loop can produce oscillations in response to the sufficiently strong IR dose (Ma et al., 2005).",

Due to the P53-dependent induction of MDM2 transcription, the increase of MDM2 proteins is sufficiently large to lower the P53 level, which in turn reduces the amount of the MDM2 proteins. The oscillation pulses shown in Fig. 7a have a period of 400 min, and the phase difference between P53 and MDM2 is about 100 min. Moreover, the first pulse is slightly higher than the second, quite similar with the experimental observations (Lahav et al., 2004) and the simulation results (Ma et al., 2005). Meantime, based on the assumption in this module that toxins including F\nw can be eliminated by the regulation effect of P53# directly, we plot the different kinetics of F\nw elimination with and without the regulatory functions of P53#. As shown in Fig. 7b, with the eliminating effect of P53# the toxins keep low level with some oscillations against the toxins increasing dramatically without P53#.",

By using a set of differential equations, combined with the Poisson random function, the stochastic kinetics of DSBs generating was implemented under constant effect of acute IR dose. Meanwhile, we assume that there are adequate repair proteins available around damage sites. Therefore, the increasing DSBC signal trigger the switch-like ATM activation, and further prompt the regulatory functions of P53 gene networks in response to genome stresses. In addition, we deal that F\nw is a part of toxins accumulated within the cell during radiotherapy, and further assume that the toxins can be eliminated directly by the regulatory functions of P53 gene regulatory networks.",

Once the IR dose is sufficiently large, the P53-MDM2 feedback loop will produce oscillations. Especially, the number and amplitude of the oscillations are different according to the IR dose domains and radiation time (Qi et al., in press-a, Qi et al., in press-b, Bar-Or et al., 2000). Also, we can present the importance of P53# in response to the genome stresses under radiotherapy, and simulate the internal self-defense mechanisms to eliminate toxins further.",
