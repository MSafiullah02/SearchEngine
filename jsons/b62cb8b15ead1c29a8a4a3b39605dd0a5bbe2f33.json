Some of them can block the interaction of viral glycoproteins to the host cell receptors acting as antiviral agents. Although cyanobacterial lectins have presented broad biotechnological potential, little research has been directed to Amazonian Cyanobacterial diversity. In order to identify new antiviral lectins, we performed genomic analysis in seven cyanobacterial strains from Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Amaz\u00f4nica de Cianobact\u00e9rias e Microalgas (CACIAM). We found 75 unique CDS presenting one or more lectin domains. Since almost all were annotated as hypothetical proteins, we used homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the structural and functional properties of three CDS that were more similar to known antiviral lectins.

CACIAM 70d presented one CDS, which was identified as a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure with binding sites predicted for sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine.

In fact, an identity of approximately 33% is capable of reducing the cytotoxic 50-fold and maintaining the antiviral activity in microvirin 10 . Cyanovirin is more active than microvirin due its bivalent iterations with the viral envelopes 53 , so new cyanovirin forms may present combined properties to be potent inhibitors and less cytotoxic than current variants at the same time.

The heating procedure lasted 650 ps until step 13 and was performed using an NVT ensemble. Afterward, a 2-ns equilibration phase was employed in an NPT ensemble. The SHAKE algorithm was employed to restrict vibration of the ligations of all hydrogen atoms.

A genomic search approach returned a reasonable number of sequences with lectin domains and this pipeline may be replicated in different organisms to help in lectin identification, given that the number of sequences annotated as hypothetical protein was superior to 50%. It was also possible to identify two cyanovirin homologues with average sequence identity with PDB proteins, one annotated as cyanovirin and the other as hypothetical protein, both with the binding property demonstrated by molecular dynamics analysis. Additionally, the genomic search allied with homology modeling suggests that the Alkalinema sp. CACIAM 70d lectin model validated here is a binding sugar lectin, the first one reported for this cyanobacteria genus. Thus, the identification and the characterization of new lectins and their homologues are a promising area in antiviral research, and Amazonian cyanobacteria present biotechnological potential to be explored in this regard.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "tion (Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Amaz\u00f4nica de Cianobact\u00e9rias e Microalgas) maintained by Laborat\u00f3rio de Tecnologia Biomolecular at Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1, Brazil.
