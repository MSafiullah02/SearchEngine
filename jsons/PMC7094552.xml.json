            "text": "The management of preweaned dairy heifer calves in the United States is complex and varies based on many factors, including operation size and location. Previous reports regarding management practices of preweaned dairy calves have been published (Heinrichs et al., 1994; Fulwider et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2012). However, continual change in the industry necessitates current information regarding management practices of preweaned dairy heifer calves throughout the United States. Additionally, rearing heifer calves is an expensive endeavor at approximately $5.50/calf per day (Zwald et al., 2007). Nevertheless, the cost of raising a heifer calf generally does not exceed the cost of purchasing a springing heifer (McGuirk, 2008). Therefore, ensuring that preweaned heifer calves are managed properly to produce healthy dairy cows is extremely important to the industry. As part of USDA's National Animal Health Monitoring System Dairy 2014 study (USDA, 2016), the calf component aimed to describe current dairy heifer calf health and management practices during the preweaning period. The objectives of the longitudinal heifer calf study were to (1) describe practices related to colostrum management, milk feeding, and calf housing; (2) evaluate colostrum quality and passive transfer; (3) estimate the incidence of disease and its relationships with management factors; and (4) evaluate ADG during the preweaning period. The specific objective of this paper was to describe the study sample of operations and calves that were used to analyze factors associated with colostrum quality and passive transfer, Cryptosporidium and Giardia, morbidity and mortality, and ADG.",

However, a calf must have been alive at 24 h of age to be enrolled. Because fewer operations participated than originally planned, the target number enrolled per operation was increased to 48 calves. Additionally, because enrollment of farms did not occur as quickly as anticipated, the study encompassed 18 mo instead of the 12-mo period that was planned (Figure 2).",

Colostrum and blood samples were shipped together on ice to USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (Ames, IA). Blood samples were centrifuged at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories and serum was separated. Serum and colostrum samples were then accumulated and shipped in bulk to the Saskatoon Colostrum Co. (Saskatoon, SK, Canada) for testing. Colostrum samples were tested for IgG concentration using radial immunodiffusion and Brix score using a digital Brix refractometer. Serum samples were tested for IgG concentration using radial immunodiffusion, total protein, and Brix score using a digital Brix refractometer.

Wells 1 to 4 and 39 to 42 were for 2 replicates of each of the 4 calibrators used to generate the standard curve, wells 5 to 9 and 10 to 14 were for each of the 2 reference standards that were used to qualify the plate, and wells 15 to 38 were used for test samples. Serial 2-fold dilutions (1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32) of the bovine IgG standard (Bovine Serum Calibrator cat. no. 4005, Midland BioProducts Corp., Boone, IA), reference bovine serum (CVB bovine IgG species standard working stock is further diluted 1:4), and reference colostrum (diluted 1:15) were prepared in PBS. A 1:4 dilution of test serum and a 1:15 dilution of test colostrum were prepared using PBS. Two replicates of 4 \u00b5L of each dilution of the bovine IgG standard were dispensed for the standard curve. Two replicates of 4 \u00b5L of the diluted reference colostrum and reference serum and 4 \u00b5L of the diluted test sample were dispensed on the plate. The plates were incubated at 20 to 25\u00b0C for 18 to 19 h in a humidified chamber. As a measure of preservation to prevent microbial growth, sodium azide was added to the liquefied agarose solution to a final concentration of 0.01%. A plate reader was used to measure and record the ring diameters for the precipitin rings surrounding the wells (Digital RID reader, AD400, The Binding Site Inc., San Diego, CA). Using the results (ring diameters) obtained for each of the 2-fold dilutions of the bovine IgG standard and an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) with calculation formulas, a regression line was generated for each plate for the variables R (ring diameter) versus log10 (concentration). The plate was considered acceptable if the coefficient of determination was greater than 0.97 for the standard curve, and the mean values for the reference colostrum and reference serum were the expected values \u00b110%. Immunoglobulin concentration for the test sample was determined using the regression line of the bovine IgG standard obtained for each plate. The diameters were entered into a template where the regression line and immunoglobulin concentration (g/L) were calculated.",

According to the NAHMS Dairy 2014 study, Holsteins were housed on 89.6% of operations and represented 86.0% of all US dairy cows, whereas Jerseys were housed on 28.2% of operations and represented 7.8% of all US dairy cows (USDA, 2016). The distribution of enrolled calves born by month ranged from 5.6% in December to 9.8% in June. Almost two-thirds of enrolled calves were born in 2014 (62.6%).",

However, because a calf must have been alive at 24 h of age to be enrolled in this study and no bull calves were enrolled, it is likely that the overall twinning rate and dystocia scores reported above are underestimated. Nonetheless, the physiological effects associated with dystocia, such as metabolic acidosis and increased time to standing, can reduce long-term calf survival (House, 2002; Lombard et al., 2007). Therefore, decreasing the dystocia rate and addressing the negative physiological effects are important for ensuring short- and long-term calf health and survival.",

Only 8.7% of operations and 6.7% of calves were provided heat-treated colostrum. This is slightly higher than the 1.5% of operations that reported heat-treating colostrum in the NAHMS Dairy 2014 study (USDA, 2016). Heat-treated colostrum was generally heated to 60\u00b0C, except on 1 operation on which colostrum was heated to 63\u00b0C. The majority of calves in the study (63.2%) received colostrum via a bottle. Nevertheless, 22.1% of calves on 51.0% of operations received colostrum via suckling from their dams. Furthermore, only 17.3% of all operations, representing 11.8% of calves, reported an on-farm Brix reading of their colostrum before laboratory testing. However, in the NAHMS Dairy 2014 study, only 4.1% of operations reported completing an on-farm Brix reading (USDA, 2016). In total, 278 calves had both on-farm and laboratory Brix readings. The mean for all on-farm colostrum Brix readings was 23.6%, which was the same as the mean laboratory colostrum Brix reading of 23.5%. Of all colostrum samples that were tested on-farm and considered high quality (>22%), 17.9% of samples were below the 22% cutoff when tested at the laboratory. The majority of calves (77.3%) received excellent quality colostrum (>50 g/L). Nevertheless, 90.3% of operations had at least 1 colostrum sample with an IgG concentration of 50 g/L or less. Additionally, 16.5% of operations had greater than 90% of all colostrum samples with an IgG concentration >50 g/L. This illustrates that almost all operations fed suboptimal colostrum to at least 1 newborn calf and reinforces the importance of testing the quality of all colostrum samples on-farm. Approximately three-fourths of all tested calves (72.7%) had excellent passive transfer of immunity (serum IgG concentration >15 g/L). Conversely, 76.0% of operations (13.0% of all calves) had at least 1 calf considered to have failure of passive transfer of immunity with serum IgG below 10 g/L (Gay, 1983). Only 16.3% of operations had >90% of sampled calves with excellent passive transfer (>15 g/L). Serum total protein and serum Brix score, which are often used as on-farm measurements of passive transfer, showed similar results to serum IgG concentration. Serum total protein level and serum Brix scores were compared with serum IgG concentration to develop comparable categories (R2 = 0.803 and R2 = 0.797, respectively). Of all serum total protein samples tested, 15.6% of calves were considered to have failure of passive transfer of immunity (serum total protein concentration <5.1 g/L) and 75.4% had excellent passive transfer of immunity (\u22655.4 g/L) based on serum total protein concentration. About one-fifth (21.2%) of all farms had \u226590% of calves with excellent serum total protein. Serum Brix score classified 15.2% of all calves to have failure of passive transfer of immunity (<8.1% serum Brix score) and 71.3% to have excellent passive transfer of immunity (\u22658.6%). Slightly fewer farms (15.4%) had \u226590% of calves with excellent serum Brix score. The mean time to first colostrum feeding and amount at first colostrum feeding for all calves was 2.8 h (SE 0.1), and 2.9 L (SE 0.0; Table 4\n). The mean total amount of colostrum provided to all calves in the first 24 h was 4.5 L (SE 0.0). The mean colostrum IgG concentration for all heifer calves was 74.2 g/L (SE 0.7) and the mean serum IgG concentration for all calves was 21.7 g/L (SE 0.2).",

Following these recommendations has been proven to reduce failure of passive transfer. Additionally, it is recommended that, on the farm level, 90% of all calves have excellent passive transfer to minimize overall morbidity and mortality (McGuirk and Collins, 2004). Pooling of colostrum from multiple dams is generally thought to decrease overall colostrum quality and increase disease risk, as it might result in mixing larger volumes of low-quality colostrum with smaller volumes of higher quality colostrum and mixing of possible disease pathogens (Arthur et al., 1996). Heat treatment of colostrum needs to be performed at a low temperature (60\u00b0C) for a longer period of time (60 min) compared with milk pasteurization to prevent protein (i.e., immunoglobulin) denaturation (Godden et al., 2006). A Brix refractometer is a simple on-farm instrument to evaluate colostrum quality and passive transfer status; a Brix reading greater than 22% represents quality Holstein colostrum (Quigley et al., 2013). Very few operations in this study used a Brix refractometer to measure colostrum quality. However, measuring colostrum quality before administration can help prevent failure of passive transfer.

            "text": "Historically, individual housing of calves has been promoted by the dairy industry because of studies that showed increased weight gain and lower disease incidence (Chua et al., 2002). However, recent studies demonstrated potential benefits of group housing for calves, both socially and physically (Chua et al., 2002; De Paula Vieira et al., 2010). Given that research supports both housing strategies, each farm must assess its management style, ability to detect disease in calves, and overall calf-rearing priorities to decide the best housing style for the operation. Disbudding or dehorning is routinely performed on preweaned dairy calves to reduce the risk of injury to other cattle and workers. Dehorning is a painful procedure regardless of the method used. However, an analgesic or anesthetic helps minimize the pain of the procedure (Graf and Senn, 1999; Grondahl-Nielsen et al., 1999; Stafford and Mellor, 2005). Ultimately, managing perioperative pain associated with disbudding or dehorning can minimize the negative effects attributed to pain, including decreased weight gain (Stafford and Mellor, 2011). Nutritional requirements\u2014including high-quality calf starter and fresh clean water\u2014should be met from the first day of life throughout the preweaning period to support calf growth and rumen development (BAMN, 2003).",

Protein is considered the rate-limiting nutrient for calf growth (Drackley, 2008). Therefore, as long as the liquid diet is similar in quality to whole waste milk, all diet types should be sufficient for calf growth. Historically, calf-feeding programs included twice-daily feedings of approximately 2 L/feeding (Thickett et al., 1986). This practice of restricting milk intake led to increased starter intake but at the cost of calf health and growth. More recently, enhanced feeding programs with higher percentage protein milk replacers or ad libitum feeding programs have gained popularity (Jasper and Weary, 2002; Terr\u00e9 et al., 2009).",

Both studies are in agreement on areas that have improved within the dairy industry, such as decreased mortality and decreased failure of passive transfer. Additionally, this study describes areas where producers can continue to advance heifer calf management and welfare, such as enhanced feeding programs to increase ADG, detection of clinical disease signs, and weaning programs to efficiently and effectively wean calves. As stated earlier, rearing heifer calves is an expensive endeavor, at approximately $5.50/calf per day. Therefore, research to maximize the efficiency of raising replacement heifers and minimize losses due to morbidity and mortality is extremely important. The descriptive statistics reported here can be used as a source for researchers to better understand current practices regarding dairy heifer calf management and ultimately help guide various research projects in the future. These results can also be used to guide education programs for dairy producers to improve overall heifer calf health.",
