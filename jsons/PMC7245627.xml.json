Common presentations include fever, abdominal discomfort, headache, myalgia, and rashes. Lung, liver, and kidney involvement may complicate the disease [7]. Given the non-specific clinical syndrome and limited access to diagnostics, rickettsioses are likely underdiagnosed in Indonesia. Underdiagnoses could engender inappropriate management, treatment delays, prolonged hospitalisation, and increased morbidity and mortality [11, 12]. Therefore, early diagnosis and empirical therapy of rickettsioses are important.",

IgM and IgG for Scrub typhus were tested using ELISA (InBios, Seattle, WA). Detailed methods for these assays have been described previously [15, 16]. Convalescent plasma from 975 patients were tested for IgG against R. typhi. Due to logistic reasons, only a subset was tested for spotted fever group (n = 634) and scrub typhus (n = 504). If IgG was positive, IgM and IgG from acute and convalescent plasma were tested simultaneously to assess seroconversion, increase or high optical density and index value in paired samples. In these subjects, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed to detect IgM and IgG reactivity to R. typhi and R. ricketsii (Focus diagnostics, CA) following the manufacturer\u2019s procedures as previously described [15]. A specimen was considered positive when IgM or IgG fluorescence was observed in the 1:64 dilution. To determine four-fold increase, acute specimens were diluted by two-fold until IgM or IgG fluorescence was not observed. The dilution where IgM or IgG fluorescence was still detected was the end titer of the specimens. The corresponding convalescent specimens was then diluted four-fold of the end titer dilution of the acute specimens. Four-fold increase of IgM or IgG was confirmed when fluorescence was still detected in these diluted convalescent specimens [17]. Sero-conversion of IgM or IgG antibodies was confirmed when no fluorescence was detected in 1:64 dilution in acute specimens but was detected in 1:64 dilution in convalescent specimens.",

Bacterial DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Rickettsia sp. were detected by the 17-kD outer membrane protein (17-kD omp) gene of Rickettsia sp., while R. typhi was identified by the ompB gene of R. typhi following previously published methods [18, 19] and O. tsutsugamushi by its 47-kD omp gene [20]. Specimens positive for 17-KD omp gene of Rickettsia sp but not the ompB gene of R. typhi underwent PCR and nested PCR amplification using primer set RompB3503F, RompB4293R, RompB4246R targeting 743-bp sequence of Rickettsia sp. ompB gene and followed by DNA sequencing to determine Rickettsial species [21]. Randomly selected samples with positive R. typhi based on qPCR, were confirmed with the same amplification and sequencing method. Sequence chromatograms were edited using BioEdit 7.2.5. software [22]; edited sequences were searched for similarity using BLASTn. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA7 and inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The analysis involved 704-bp (nucleotide 3556\u20134259 of R. typhi ompB gene).",

Second, clinicians may not include rickettsioses in their differential diagnosis. Literature demonstrating the importance of Rickettsia infection in the hospital setting is lacking. Previous reports were from a few serologically-confirmed patients from three cities in 1976, 1996 [28], 1997\u20132000 [9], 2006 [10] and may not have reached clinicians. Third, access to diagnostic tests for rickettsioses is poor and specificity is low for available rapid diagnostics for other pathogens such as S. typhi, dengue virus and Leptospira spp. Reports from Laos also describe difficulties in differentiating these 4 pathogens [29].",

In contrast, the six initially suspected leptospirosis cases had positive Leptospira IgM, although reference laboratory confirmatory antibody testing and PCR were negative, except in one case with possible co-infection. This suggests that severe R. typhi may clinically resemble leptospirosis (myalgia, abdominal pain, icterus) [29] and clinicians should interpret the results of leptospira antibody tests cautiously. Poor specificity of the Leptospira IgM test, both with rapid testing and ELISA, has been reported [35].

However, PCR and IFA have several disadvantages, including the need for an expensive thermal cycler or a fluorescence microscope, which are often unavailable in endemic resource-limited settings, and experienced technicians [39]. Therefore, ELISA can be an alternative when both are unavailable [40]. Proper empiric management, including administration of appropriate antibiotics, and early diagnostic strategies will minimize disease sequelae.
