The maintenance of the native structure was checked by immunoelectrophoresis and Western blotting and the activity by an ELISA specifically recognizing E. coli (20).

For this reason we used a protocol based on the administration of 2 SEB doses (0.5 mg SEB/kg body weight), the first on d 30 (d 9 after weaning) and the second on d 33. Healthy rats received PBS.

The model employed in this study, based on the administration of 2 consecutive i.p. SEB doses, aimed to induce a mild inflammatory state with few repercussions on animal welfare, to avoid interference with the normal food intake pattern. The i.p. route is widely used in models of intestinal inflammation (15,22) because the oral route has the disadvantage that the amount of SEB reaching the mucosa is variable because it can be hydrolyzed by enteric enzymes, thus requiring coadministration of trypsin inhibitors (23). We chose rats at the weaning period because the mucosal immune system is still immature and therefore more susceptible to infection. In our model, food intake and growth rates were unaffected, indicating that basic intestinal and metabolic functions were not impaired. This is remarkable because the period chosen is a time at which rats (and mammals in general) move from liquid to solid food, thus becoming more susceptible to dietary and environmental aggressions (24).",

In the intestine, both effects eventually lead to alteration of the mucosal barrier and induction of intestinal secretion and diarrhea. TNF-\u03b1 can downregulate Na+/K+-ATPase in mice (29) and change Cl\u2212 and K+ transport toward secretion in the human colon (30). Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3 is involved in selective downregulation of intestinal Na+ absorption, in part by decreasing expression and activity of the apical membrane Na+ transporters NHE2 and NHE3 (31), which can also contribute to intestinal secretion.",

In Peyer's patches, SEB increases the T lymphocyte population, supporting the view that SEB binds mainly to the TCR (15). When analyzing the activated lymphocytes within the 2 major subpopulations, CD4+ and CD8+, we observed that the main effect of SEB is circumscribed to the T helper cells, in agreement with results of McKay et al. (26) and No\u00ebl et al. (39). This increase in T helper activation was prevented by dietary supplementation with SDAP. The \u03b3\u03b4 T-lymphocyte values for the cytotoxic cells in Peyer's patches from Healthy rats were in the range of values found for CBA/J mice (40). This population, together with the NK cells, increased when rats were treated with the double SEB dose, indicating that SEB also enhances cytotoxic cell populations. This confirms previous observations in mice (41) and is consistent with observations in humans [\u03b3\u03b4-T cells, (42); NK cells, (43)]. Dietary supplementation with SDAP brings the percentages of these cytotoxic populations close to the values of Healthy rats. The different effects of SDAP and IC can be due to the different biological activity of their protein composition (SDAP contains all plasma components, whereas IC contains only the Ig fraction). Therefore, although immunoglobulins present in plasma may be the main agents responsible for SDAP activity, other functional proteins, such as transferrin, growth factors, and enzymes, may also contribute to the effects of SDAP.",

However, it is also clear that inappropriate immune reactions can result in tissue damage and pathology (26) that may lead to depression of growth. In this study, we showed that dietary SDAP and IC supplementation consistently reduced the percentage of several lymphocyte populations with specific functions in inflammatory states. The diet supplemented with SDAP prevented major activation of CD4+ cells produced by SEB, indicating that rats fed SDAP did not develop the same degree of activation of T helper cells. SDAP also prevented the increase in the \u03b3\u03b4-T lymphocytes, which supports the hypothesis that a SDAP-containing diet can play a role in the modulation of the immune response by limiting the immune activation that would compromise the utilization of food energy (12). These systemic effects should be added to the well-known luminal effects of SDAP, preventing the activation of GALT by reducing the probability of bacterial agents and bacterial products reaching the intestinal mucosa (10).",

Our results show that SDAP (as well as IC, albeit to a lesser extent) protects GALT from possible activation provoked by S. aureus enterotoxin B. Extrapolation of the results obtained in the laboratory to the situation in farm animals is not straightforward because laboratory rats are not exposed to the same pathogen load that can affect farm animals. However, our results indicate a role for SDAP in limiting immune responses that could eventually compromise the utilization of energy from the diet.",
