However, there are still many controversies and confusions regarding the efficacy and safety of polymyxins based therapies in treating CRAB infections. While numerous reports showed good therapeutic effects of polymyxins based therapies [11, 12], some reports linked polymyxins based therapies with a higher mortality [13, 14]. Other antibiotics, such as tigecycline and sulbactam, alternative therapeutic options against CRAB, also have shown mixed clinical outcomes [15]. Therefore, it is important to elucidate whether the polymyxins based therapies are more effective than other alternative treatments in patients with CRAB infection.",

All data extraction was done independently and checked by two authors (CL and YZ) using a pre-defined data extraction form and then compared for verification. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed by four authors (CL, YZ, XL & JW) using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool endorsed by Cochrane Scientific Committee for observational studies [17]. We assessed the risk of bias for seven domains including bias due to confounding, selection of participants into the study, classification of the intervention, deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing data, measurement of outcomes, and selection of the reported result. The rating of each domain ranged from low, moderate, serious, to critical risk, and no information (NI). The rating of risk of bias was based on the data we used for meta-analysis rather than the data in publications. Any discrepancies were settled by consensus.",

Dichotomous variables including 1-month mortality, clinical response, microbiological response, and adverse events were described by OR and CI. Continuous variable, length of stay in hospital, was described by SMD and CI. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Q statistics and I2 tests (P < 0.05 and I2 > 50% suggesting significant heterogeneity). Sensitivity analyses were performed on efficacy outcomes to identify the source of heterogeneity by excluding the studies with serious risk of bias, excluding studies published before 2010, excluding studies with small sample size and excluding studies with inadequate balance in baseline characteristics. The leave-one-out analysis was conducted to ensure that no single study unduly influenced the overall effect size. A funnel plot was used to measure the publication bias. Egger\u2019s test and Peters\u2019 test were used to evaluate the asymmetry of funnel plot [18]. Subgroup analyses were done to compare the efficacy split by infection site, route of administration and region. All the above analyses were performed with Review Manager (RevMan) software, Version 5.3, (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014.) except the analysis of publication bias, which was done with STATA software, Version 13.0.

The research hospitals are in North America and Europe (USA, Greece, Spain, Turkey, and France), Middle East (Iran, and Israel) and Asia (Taiwan, China, and Thailand). Two studies [25, 26] assessed patients with intracranial infections (such as meningitis). One study [13] reported on patients with intra-abdominal infection. Five studies examined pneumonia [14, 20\u201322, 24], including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Three studies [19, 23, 27] included more than one site of infection.

In the control group, carbapenems, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, quinolones, aminoglycosides and glycylcycline (tigecycline) were the most commonly used alternative antibiotics. In 7 studies [13, 14, 19\u201321, 23, 24], the intravenous (IV) route of administration was used in both polymyxins and control groups. But in the other 4 studies [22, 25\u201327], patients in polymyxins group received IV and intrathecal/intracerebral (IT) polymyxins or IV and inhaled (IH) polymyxins, while patients in control group were given IV antibiotics only.

The common confounding factors were comorbidities (especially immunodeficiency), mixed infection sites, antibiotic susceptibility, severity of disease, and empirical treatment. Six studies [13, 23\u201327] were judged to be at serious risk in the domain of \u201cbias in classification of interventions\u201d because of lacking records of the dose/loading dose, frequency, and timing of intervention.

Studies were classified into 4 subgroups in terms of infection site, i.e., pneumonia, mixed infection, intracranial infection, and intra-abdominal infection. The pooled ORs of 1-month mortality did not differ from the primary analysis remarkably. No significant difference was seen between polymyxins based therapies and non-polymyxins based therapies after subgrouping. The pooled ORs of pneumonia, intracranial infection and mixed infection were 1.10 (95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66), 0.27 (95% CI, 0.02 to 3.35) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.39 to 2.50), respectively. Only one paper reported the intra-abdominal infection caused by CRAB and the OR was 0.72 with 95% CI (0.15 to 3.54) (Fig. 5). A subgroup analysis was carried out based on route of administration to compare the 1-month mortality between a subset of studies in which antibiotics were given intravenously in both groups and a subset of studies in which polymyxins were given by multiple routes. The pooled OR of studies, in which multiple routes (IV plus IH/IT) were used for polymyxins administration, was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.96). The pooled OR was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.83) in studies that antibiotics were administered intravenously only (Fig. 6). This result indicated that lower mortality was associated with the direct delivery of polymyxins to the focus of infection by intrathecal/intracerebral ventricle injection or inhalation. A subgroup analysis was also carried out according to geographical region in order to understand the regional difference of 1-month mortality. Interestingly, the result showed that studies from Middle East region were in favor of non-polymyxin therapies because of lower mortality rate (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.98) (Fig. 7).\n",

However, the cases included in their analysis did not share a clear definition of carbapenem resistance. They evaluated the treatments of A. baumannii infections showing different types of drug resistance or no resistance. Given the importance of distinguishing drug resistance in antimicrobial treatments, a clear definition of drug resistance in our study selection could reduce the heterogeneity of meta-analysis. Furthermore, only the studies involving adult patients were included in our analysis, while Liu et al. compiled studies of both adult and pediatric patients. Considering the unique physiological and microbiological conditions of pediatric patients, antimicrobial therapy targeting resistant microorganisms should be discussed in pediatric patients separately. This report is therefore a more robust meta-analysis with improved study design.",

Only 3 of the 11 studies were at moderate risk of bias and the others were at serious risk of bias. Second, the studied population was heterogeneous. The diverse baseline conditions of infections and comorbidities introduced unknown confounding factors. Third, lacking information about drug use for comorbidity may cause the underestimation of unknown drug-drug interaction which affected the clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the sample size was small which could reduce the power of our analysis. Taking together, the findings must be interpreted with caution. Our results may be not representative enough for the whole picture of the polymyxins based and non-polymyxins based therapies against CRAB infections.",

More randomized trials are needed to address the exact efficacy of different anti-CRAB treatments. Renal function monitoring to adjust the dose of polymyxin accordingly could largely improve the safety of polymyxin treatment [31]. Stewardship of polymyxin use also helps to prevent the emergence of polymyxin-resistant bacteria. More importantly, all healthcare providers should work closely to keep prioritizing research and development of new antibiotics.",
