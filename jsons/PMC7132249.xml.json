Over the course of the 24 d of the travel lockdowns, we found that an average of five cases (95% CI: 4 to 6) were exported per day, an 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%) average reduction in the exportation rate predicted in the absence of any border measures.

As expected, we found that the reported arrival of the first importations for these countries was negatively correlated with the number of airports that had direct flights to and from mainland China for 21 countries/regions as of January 30, 2020 (r = \u22120.43, P value = 0.05; Table 1 and Fig. 2B). For example, Japan, with 60 such airports, and Sri Lanka, with one such airport, reported their first COVID-19 importations on January 6 and January 19, respectively (Fig. 2B).

Our estimate is consistent with data from 20 importation cases around the world, indicating 3.5 d (\u00b12.2 SD) between arrival and symptom onset (Fig. 3D, blue dots). Assuming the serial interval to be distributed with an average of 7.5 d and SD of 3.4 d (10), we estimated that the first transmission event occurs, on average, 4 d (95% CI: 3.2 to 4.8) after symptom onset (Fig. 3D).

            "text": "In the calibration of our model, we considered two scenarios, for the possibility of a symptomatic individual to travel until 1) first medical visit, and 2) hospitalization (SI Appendix, Table S3). We found that the effectiveness of screening depends on this assumption, with longer symptomatic travel periods corresponding to a higher proportion of cases detected by February 15, 2020. If cases travel up to their first clinical visit [between 4.6 d and 5.8 d after symptom onset (10)], then we estimated that 64.3% (95% CI: 55.4 to 71.3%) of international COVID-19 case importations out of China were still presymptomatic (incubating) while traveling; if cases travel up to the point of hospitalization [between 9.1 d and 12.5 d after symptom onset (10)], this proportion reduces to 49.5% (95% CI: 40.4 to 57.4%), which is comparable to a previously published estimate of 46% (22). Additional information on both the incubation period and travel behavior of symptomatic individuals is required to provide more-accurate estimates of effectiveness of airport screening.",

Therefore, our results indicate that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese Government averted 71% of these cases. A previous analysis evaluated city-level risk of importation events between January and March (23) but did not consider importation timing. Our analysis, which utilizes incidence data in mainland China, suggests that the first exportation event was likely to have occurred almost 3 wk before the travel ban. Our prediction of exportation timings is consistent with the timing and locations of the first 21 COVID-19 cases reported outside of China.",

Due to the logistical difficulty of identifying COVID-19 cases during the incubation period, some countries are requesting individuals to self-report any exposure to the virus, self-monitor for symptoms, and voluntarily quarantine if symptoms arise (17). Prior surveys of pandemic influenza suggest that the proportion of people self-isolating can range from 70 to 95% if those people are diagnosed with the disease (27, 28).

As of February 21, there are at least 14 countries that have reported human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (8).

Our study highlights the importance of complementary containment measures, such as contact tracing and voluntary quarantine, in limiting the global spread of the pandemic. With the availability of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the risk of additional importation can be mitigated by focusing initial distribution of these vaccines in the regions where the imported cases have been identified and, secondarily, in regions that are highly connected to the affected areas.",
