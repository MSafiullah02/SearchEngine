Neutralizing antibody was induced by vaccine with and without adjuvant and lung virus was reduced in vaccinated mice after challenge. Lung mononuclear infiltrates occurred in all groups after virus challenge but with increased infiltrates that contained eosinophils and increases in the eosinophil promoting IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines only in the vaccine groups. Inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine appears to carry a hypersensitive-type lung pathology risk from MERS-CoV infection that is similar to that found with inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines from SARS-CoV infection.",

We then began tests to determine if vaccination with inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine would result in immunopathology in vaccinated hosts similar to that seen with SARS-CoV. A mouse model for studies of MERS-CoV was not initially available since mice and other small animals lack the MERS-CoV receptor. For this reason, we developed a transgenic mouse model containing the human DPP4 receptor. 5, 6 Availability of this model provided the opportunity to assess whether an inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine would induce protection against MERS-CoV infection but also induce an eosinophil-containing pulmonary immunopathology as had similar SARS-CoV vaccines. This is the first report that a similar risk for immunopathology appears to exist for MERS-CoV-inactivated vaccines despite an ability to protect against infection.",

Inactivated supernatants, negative in rigorous isolation tests, were subjected to polyethylene glycol/salt precipitation, purified by sucrose density centrifugation, 7 and diluted in PBS to an equivalent of \u00bb1 \u00a3 10 7 TCID 50 /ml. Western blot analysis by using a rabbit anti-MERS-CoV antibody demonstrated virus structural proteins including surface protein (S) and nucleoprotein (data not shown). 5, 8 For assessing the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of this WIV as well as its potential to elicit immunopathology upon live virus challenge of vaccinated animals, groups of six hCD26/DPP4 transgenic mice were immunized intramuscularly (I.M.) twice, three weeks apart. Mice received 100 ml of WIV only, WIV adjuvanted with alhydrogel 2% (alum) or with MF59 (Invivogen), or alum or MF59 only, according to protocols approved by the IACUC committee at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Sera were collected 21 days after the second immunization for micro-neutralization antibody tests; mice were then challenged intranasally (I.N.) with 10 3 TCID 50 (100 LD 50 ) of MERS-CoV, 6 and sacrificed on days 3 or 6 (3 from each group on each day) for assessing lung viral loads by Vero E6-based infection and quantitative (q) PCR assays targeting the UpE gene of MERS-CoV, and lung cytokines transcriptional profiling of TH1 (IFN-g) and TH2 (IL-5 and IL-13) in qRT-PCR assays as previously described. 5, 6 Additionally, de-paraffinized sections were stained with either routine hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) for histopathologic evaluations or an antibody specific to eosinophil major basic protein (MBP), provided by the Lee Laboratory, for confirming eosinophil infiltrations, as described. 3, 9 Figure 1 shows that neither adjuvant alone group developed detectable neutralizing antibodies, whereas all vaccine groups developed significantly greater neutralizing antibody responses than the group with adjuvant alone (P < 0.01). Further, the mean titer for WIV/MF59 was higher than that for the WIV/ Alum group (P < 0.01). Consistent with the absence of specific antibody response, infectious virus was readily detected in the lungs of three infected animals immunized with alum only (MF59 group not available) on days 3 and 6, with an average of 10 3.1 and 10 2.8 TCID 50 /gm, respectively, in which the limit of detection (LOD) in the Vero E6 cell-based infectivity assay was \u00bb10 1.8 TCID 50 /gm. In contrast, infectious virus remained undetectable in all of the vaccine groups at either time ( Fig. 2A-B) . Titers of viral RNA, as revealed by qRT-PCR assays and expressed as TCID 50 equivalents, were also compared among the groups. All groups exhibited detectable viral RNAs (Fig. 2C-D) . The titers were lower in all vaccine groups on day 3 but none were significantly lower than those of the controls (Fig. 2C) ; however, the titer for each vaccine group on day 6 was significantly lower than those of either adjuvant only group (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2D) . The titers in the WIV/MF59 group were also significantly lower than those in either of the other 2 vaccine groups (P < 0.01).",

The day 3 pattern was similar in each test, and there were no significant differences between tests Figure 3 . Representative photomicrographs of lung tissue 3 days after challenge of previously vaccinated mice with MERS-CoV. Lung sections were stained with an antibody directed specifically against eosinophilic major basic protein as described (3); eosinophils are brown. The vaccine groups (alum only, MF59 only, WIV only, WIV plus Alum and WIV plus MF59) and the eosinophil infiltration severity score (E0 and E2) are noted on the micrograph; E0 is none, E2 is moderate. (Fig. 4) . Some cytokine activities were seen in the adjuvant only groups but were not significantly different from those in uninfected animals. However, significant increases were seen for all 3 cytokines tested in the vaccine groups. Notable are the increases of IL-5 and IL-13, cytokines associated with hypersensitivity reactions that include eosinophil infiltrations. 10, 11 Cytokine levels were lower for the vaccine groups for IL-5 and IL-13 at day 6 and not significantly greater than those for the uninfected; however, IFN-g was significantly increased for the WIV, WIV/MF59 and MF59 only groups (P < 0.01) (data not shown). This study was conducted to test whether an inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine would induce neutralizing antibody and protection against MERS-CoV infection and yet lead to a hypersensitivity-type lung immunopathologic reaction with eosinophil infiltrations when challenged with infectious virus, as had been seen with SARS-CoV-inactivated vaccines. 3 The results suggest that a similar risk exists for inactivated MERS-CoV vaccines.",

Support for attributing the immunopathology to a TH2-type immune response has been provided by immunizations with inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines and TH1-type adjuvants. Studies in mice with inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines given with a TH1 adjuvant did not exhibit a similar immunopathologic reaction after virus challenge. 14, 15 The finding for MERS-CoV vaccine and the similar findings for SARS-CoV vaccines are reminiscent of those reported in mice given a formalin-inactivated, whole-virus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and challenged with infectious RSV. [16] [17] [18] Protection against infection occurred despite an increased histopathology. A similar RSV vaccine given to infants had led to increased pulmonary disease severity and 2 deaths. 19, 20 The component(s) of the vaccine that led to the immunopathology have not been identified, but have been suggested to be viral components as well as contaminants and formalin effects. However, Immunopathology with SARS-CoV vaccines occurred for whole-virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, different inactivation methods, different preparation substrates, and with recombinant surface (S) protein. This experience may indicate that the responsible components(s) for the SARS and MERS-CoV vaccines are viral. Results of studies with vector vaccines point to the nucleoprotein (N) protein as responsible for the immunopathological effects seen and indicate that the S protein might be free of the risk; however, rS protein induced the pathology. 3, 21, 22 Identifying and remedying the specific basis for the immunopathology would facilitate vaccine trials in humans.",

Lung homogenates and total RNAs extracted from tissues of vaccinated mice at days 3 and 6 post challenge with MERS-CoV were subjected to Vero E6 cell-based infectivity assay and one-step real-time RT-PCR analyses targeting the upE gene of MERS-CoV for assessing viral loads, as previously described(5,6). A serial 10-fold diluted MERS-CoV stock with a titer of 10 7 TCID 50 /ml was included in parallel during the quantitative PCR assays to calculate and express the levels of upE gene expression in individual specimens as log10 TCID 50 equivalents per gram of tissue.
