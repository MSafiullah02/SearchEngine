Both shared the same receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).2 Therefore, this virus was named SARS-CoV-2. By 28 March 2020, a total of 593 735 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases have been confirmed in 200 countries worldwide. In addition to the respiratory system involvement, recent evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 can affect other organ systems including nervous, vascular, digestive, urinary, haematological and so on.3 4 The pathological findings confirmed the nature of multiorgan damaged by SARS-CoV-2, which include pulmonary lesion and cerebral oedema, microvascular steatosis and thrombosis.5 Neurological symptoms can be trivial or non-specific at the early stage of the COVID-19 infected patients, which have often been delayed and misdiagnosed and led to inappropriate management. These patients then become silent contagious sources or \u2018virus spreaders\u2019. Although neurological involvement is uncommon in patients with COVID-19, it can be seen in those with severe infection and the patients may manifest as acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness or encephalopathy, and skeletal muscle injury.6\n",

CoVs was first isolated from domestic animals in 1937. The first human coronavirus was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients in 1965. In humans, CoVs infections primarily involve the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Under the electronic microscope, there are many evenly arranged protrusions on the surface of viral particles. The entire virus particle resembles a \u2018crown\u2019 of a medieval European emperor. Hence, it was given the name of \u2018coronavirus\u2019. A coronavirus particle is usually enclosed by an envelope, and its membrane surface has three proteins: spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M). Protein spike (S), projecting from the virus membrane and resembling a crown, is the key structure for its infectivity and pathogenicity. These spikes can recognise and bind to receptors on the surface of host cells and subsequently invade the host cells.7\n",

Serum D-dimer level is generally increased, which could be the source of embolic vascular events.11\n12 Many of these patients may already have other cerebrovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, smoking or previous stroke history. Some may develop their first-ever acute ischaemic stroke.6 Therefore, medical staff should pay close attention to the manifestation of neurological symptoms. If an acute ischaemic stroke patient with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are admitted, emergency treatment should be jointly offered by neurologists and infectious disease specialists. For ischaemic stroke patients with a high D-dimer level, preventive anticoagulation is recommended. These patients should be transferred to the isolation ward, and neurologists would assist in the management.",

Few patients had central nervous system symptoms before having pulmonary symptoms.6 Therefore, neurologists should be vigilant when seeing COVID-19 infected patients and look for any signs suspicious for intracranial infection, and if possible, MRI of head with and without contrast should be performed.
