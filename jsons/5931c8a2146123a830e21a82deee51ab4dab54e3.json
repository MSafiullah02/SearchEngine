Aborted fetuses, stillborn and dead lambs displayed extensive histopathological changes, consisting of hemorrhages, congestion and mononuclear infiltration in major organs. Pestiviral antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry in most tissues with remarkable signals in lungs and kidneys.

Four additional Pestivirus species have been proposed but remain officially unrecognized: (i) Pestivirus of giraffe, associated with an outbreak of mucosal-like disease in giraffes in the Nanyuki District of Kenya; (ii) Pronghorn virus, isolated from a blind pronghorn antelope in the United State; (iii) Bungowannah virus, detected in pigs following an outbreak of stillbirths and neonatal death in Australia, and (iv) a group of viruses variously referred to as HoBi-like, BVDV-3, or atypical pestiviruses (Bauermann et al., 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 319, "text": "(Simmonds et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 830, "end": 854, "text": "(Bauermann et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The prototype HoBi-like pestivirus, strain D32/00_'HoBi', was isolated from a batch of fetal bovine serum (FBS) imported from Brazil.

However, there is no agreement among pestivirologists about this proposal, considering the genetic and antigenic distance of the new viruses from other BVD viruses (Bauermann et al., 2013) . Unlike BVDVs, HoBi-like viruses do not appear to be endemic in all continents. In South America, the virus has been associated with reproductive disorders in Brazilian cattle herds, and death of water buffalos as well (Cortez et al., 2006) . The first European Hobi-like virus, strain Italy-1/10-1, was isolated from calves with severe respiratory disease in southern Italy (Decaro et al., 2011 (Decaro et al., , 2012c . Additional Hobi-like viruses were associated to abortion in multiparous cows of the same herd (Decaro et al., 2012a) and to respiratory disease in cattle of a neighboring Italian region (Decaro et al., 2013b) . In addition, natural infection of cattle with HoBi-like virus resulted in the birth of persistently infected (PI) calves (Decaro et al., 2013a) . More recently, outbreaks of mucosal disease (MD) have been observed in that country and in Brazil (Weber et al., 2014) . Evidence of HoBi-like virus in Asia has been also reported. Although no clinical sign was noted, seroconversion to HoBi-like viruses was observed in dairy herds in Thailand and one virus positive calf serum was identified (Kampa et al., 2010) .

Although no sequence analysis was conducted in the present study, a similar mechanism could also explain the presence of VN antibodies in a PI lamb, considering that the animal was tested before colostrum assumption and remained highly seropositive at an age when the maternal immunity should have declined.
