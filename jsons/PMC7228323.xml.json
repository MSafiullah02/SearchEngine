Indeed, age and pre\u2010existing conditions correlate with mortality\n2\n, \n3\n; nevertheless presentation in these children is variable, and sometimes requires aggressive management.\n2\n, \n5\n We present a mildly symptomatic pediatric case that promptly and spontaneously resolved, thus supporting the hypothesis that infants may escape detection due to milder disease presentation.",

He had been delivered at term after an uneventful pregnancy, and the mother had been vaccinated against influenza and DTP during the pregnancy as recommended per local schedule. History was unremarkable apart from close contact with his father, affected by an upper airway infection and conjunctivitis; physical examination was normal. Blood tests were within limits apart from mild neutropenia (900/\u00b5L), monocytosis (1400/\u00b5L), and presence of reactive lymphocytes at the blood smear. CRP was negative. Blood cultures and urine dipstick were negative. The pharyngeal swab resulted positive for the novel COVID\u201019 and the patient was admitted for observation.",

Of note, while the patient had not been vaccinated yet, we cannot exclude a protective role of transplacental immunoglobulin G transfer and thus possibly of vaccine cross\u2010reactivity.",

According to local policy, quarantine may be warranted for confirmed COVID\u201019 cases, symptomatic patients, or people at risk, and testing is performed accordingly. Caution dictates that children should be considered as contagious as adults. Therefore, we recommend maintaining a very low index of suspicion in children with symptoms, even in the absence of contacts with confirmed COVID\u201019 cases, in all countries affected by the outbreak. We maintain that management of children affected by COVID\u201019 should be dictated by clinical conditions, limiting hospitalization when possible; as opposed to other authors,\n2\n we advocate against routine computed tomography scans in children.",
