With respect to other observational strategies, our proposal has three important elements of strength and originality: (i) it not only aims at providing a snapshot of the phenomenon in a single moment of time, but it is designed to be a continuous survey, repeated in several waves through time, (ii) the statistical optimality properties of the estimators are formally derived in this paper and (iii) it is rapidly operational as it is required by the emergency connected with diffusion of the virus. The sample design is thought having in mind, in particular, the SAR-CoV-2 diffusion in Italy during the Spring of 2020. However, the proposed sampling design is very general, and we are confident that it could be easily extended to other geographical areas and to possible future epidemic outbreaks.",

On the other hand, a broad-based data collection of medical swabs carried out on a voluntary basis does not constitute a probabilistic sample either 6 . For instance, the practice of systematically collecting observations in the vicinity of supermarkets leads to an over-inclusion of healthy people in the sample, and to a systematic exclusion of those who (either because they are manifesting symptoms or in any case feel weak) have chosen to stay confined at home. However, it is of crucial importance for government and health officials and for the population to have a clear understanding of the dynamics of the situation in progress in order to take appropriate measures and to guide their individual behaviors. In such a situation, it is essential to set-up a system of data collection which can grant unbiased estimates and statistically significant comparisons through time and across different geographic areas. During the epidemic to be empirically relevant, not only any sample design has to be technically specified and the properties of the associated estimators have to be proved formally, but it has also to satisfy the following two conditions:",

Our aim is to suggest a sample design whose statistical optimality properties are formally proved, but that is also operational and can be immediately put into action by considering the many practical obstacles that may arise in an emergency.

In Section 3 we will present the basic sampling framework of our suggested design by distinguishing two subsets of the population to be surveyed, namely those in which a state of infection has already been verified and those that were in contact with them (group A) and the healthy persons (group B). In Section 4 we focus on the parameters of interest that we aim at measuring with our suggested design on the two groups and we discuss how to disentangle possible overlaps between them whose presence may undermine the statistical properties of the estimation. In Section 5 we provide a general description of the sampling schemes for the two groups and the various operational options to be realized. In Section 6 we prove the unbiasedness of the estimates and define the expression of the sampling variances. Section 7 is devoted to envisaging an extension of the proposed methodology to subsequent waves of data collection to monitor the phenomenon in different moments of time. Section 8 contains some discussion on the efficiency of the estimators. Finally, Section 9 concludes with some practical indications and future research priorities.",

In reviewing the various approaches followed by the different countries until early April 2020, we can identify four strategies and experiences in progress for the estimation of the phenomenon in the entire population. a) The first consists of massive test campaigns, regardless of the presence of symptoms, carried out without following a formal sampling design and essentially aimed at intervening in the outbreaks of the epidemic to identify subjects who are infected, but with no symptoms or only slight symptoms. This was the strategy of South Korea and Hong Kong, as well of United Arab Emirates, Australia, Iceland, Veneto Region in Italy; nowadays this is also the German strategy 7 . b) The second possible strategy consists in diagnostic tests through a probabilistic sample according to a planned design for the estimation of the phenomena of interest with predetermined precision levels, aimed at estimating the effective size of the infections, including the asymptomatic population. This is the case of the project by the Helmholtz Center for Research on Infections in Germany, on blood testing for antibodies to the Covid-19 pathogen involving over 100,000 individuals (Hackenbroch, 2020) .",

Finally, a random selection of people who do not meet the testing criteria will be observed at two Canberra locations by the Australian Capital Territory (Abc, 2020) . All these sample surveys have distinct characteristics from both those that are aimed at taking a photograph of the epidemic at a given time (planning to repeat the observation at a later time) and the continuous panel-type surveys with rotated sample for monitoring the evolution of the pandemic over time which constitutes the proposal of this paper and that was suggested in Germany. c) The third strategy consists of a specific massive web-survey collected on basis on individuals and households that decide to participate on a voluntary basis. Some 60,000 Israelis completed the online daily survey developed by the Weizmann Institute, disclosing personal details such as their age, gender, address, general state of health, isolation status and any symptoms they may be experiencing (Rossman et al, 2020) . We observed examples of this strategy in Iceland, Estonia and in other countries. The results allow to compare experiences of contagion and testing for people and households with different socio-economic characteristics; d) Finally, another possible strategy is that of founding the conclusions on pre-existing sample surveys, partially modified in order to collect information on the epidemic. Creating an EU 'Corona Panel', as a standardised European sample tests to uncover the true spread of the coronavirus is, indeed, the proposal of the Centre for European Policy Studies, presented by Daniel Gros (2020) . The proposal refers, in particular, to the use of the EU-wide sample of the panel of households which participate in the regular surveys on economic and social conditions, called 'EU statistics on income and living conditions' (EU-SILC). More specifically, Dewatripont et al. (2020) suggest to implement two tests using the EU-SILC panel: the first aimed at assessing whether the subject is currently infected, and the second to test whether the person has become immune due to previous exposure. Timeliness is crucial. In this respect, the latter strategy seems to guarantee good results for the European Statistical System (ESS). A quick reflection could be made on the feasibility of inserting additional modules in the survey questionnaire of the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS), obviously in accordance with the Data Protection Authorities.",

However, the unbiasedness of the sampling strategy we propose is still valid (even if less efficient) if the contacts are reconstructed for a shorter time period (e. g. 7 days).

The rational for this decomposition is related to the feasibility of the observational scheme which we will propose below. Indeed, the proportion of the infected people in the Group A is much larger than the one observed in Group B. Moreover, the number of verified infected people is known through the data collected by health public authorities. Thus, focusing the investments in observing the contacts of this group maximizes the number of infected people observed in the sample. Nevertheless, it is necessary to observe the Group B so as to produce reliable estimate referred to the whole population, which is mandatory for correctly estimating the rate of infected people or the rate of lethality.",

Given the complexity of the epidemiology of Covid-19, it may be useful to consider a higher number of sub-groups in Group B. This may become useful in the need of considering heterogeneous models (i. e. considering heterogeneous populations) as it seems to be required for the infectious agent. In particular, it may be of great importance to consider breaking down certain epidemiological parameters into different sub-groups (e. g. transmission coefficient, time to become infectious, proportion of detected cases, time to detection, time to recover). Therefore we suggest to define 4 subgroups considering both the binary factor low-risk/high-risk and the binary factor lowmobility/high-mobility. These are the following: -a number of individuals not belonging to high-risk groups who continue to travel/work (and are therefore more subject to being infected and infectious); -a number of people not belonging to high-risk groups with few contacts who fully observe the prescribed quarantine recommendations; -a number of individuals belonging to high-risk groups who continue to travel/work (and are therefore more subject to being infected and infectious), such as health-care workers; -a number of people belonging to high-risk groups with few contacts who fully observe the prescribed quarantine recommendations.",

Among other aspects to be developed, we mention those related to time and spatial correlations, useful both for modelling the phenomenon and for designing efficient spatial sampling so as to achieve the same level of precision with fewer sample units (Arbia and Lafratta (2002) . A specific extension of the spatial sampling techniques to be further developed is the use of capture/recapture techniques (Borchers, 2009) which would require an overlap of the samples of groups A and B. Other general aspects to be developed with different specialists are the integration of the statistical system we propose with the health authority's surveillance system for the infected and the use for statistical purposes of the contact-tracking devices, both in the identification of contacts and in the measure of the propensity to travel and of the connected risks.",
