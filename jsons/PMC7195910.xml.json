The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia referred to as neo-coronary pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 raised global health concerns. Neo-coronary pneumonia has been officially named by the World Health Organization as corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 virus has been identified as a zoonotic coronavirus, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. Among all known RNA viruses, coronaviruses have the largest genomes ranging from 26 to 32 kb in length [16]. The ~ 306 aa long main protease is a key enzyme for coronavirus replication and is suitable for designing wide-spectrum inhibitors. It is responsible for processing the polypeptide into functional proteins [20]. The protease\u2019s activity is triggered by the binding of molecules to specific points on the protease called active sites. However, the protease\u2019s activity can also be blocked by molecules called inhibitors. When an inhibitor attaches to an active site, it prevents the binding of substrates\u2014inhibiting the action of the protease altogether. Therefore, finding an inhibitor for COVID-19\u2019s protease may be the first step to beating the epidemic. Thus the viral protease is a proven drug discovery target in case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and an attractive target for the design of anti-corona viral drugs.",

Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide pro-drug with potent in vitro antiviral activity against a diverse panel of RNA viruses such as Ebola virus, Marburg, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, respiratory syncytial virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus [18]. Similarly, nelfinavir, lopinavir and ritonavir are protease inhibitors recommended for the treatment of SARS and MERS, which have similar mechanisms of action as HIV [13]. Using Vero cell lines infected with SARS-CoV, antiviral effects of nelfinavir has been studied [9, 25]. A separate investigation performed by Xu et al. [24] indicated that nelfinavir was identified as a potential inhibitor against COVID-19 main protease, based on binding free energy calculations using molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) model and solvated interaction energy methods.",

China\u2019s national health commission has recommended using these agents as an adhoc treatment against COVID-19. Since SARS-CoV-2 infection is an RNA virus similar to HIV, lopinavir/ritonavir is proposed for its management despite the absence of official approval of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. At present, lopinavir/ritonavir is used for possible treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in countries where the emerging infection prevails [1]. Due to the absence of crystallographic structure of SARS-CoV 3C-like protease, binding modes of these compounds have been proposed through docking studies [4, 14]. Antiviral like \u03b1-ketoamides have also been reported in the literature as inhibitors of the coronavirus main protease [11]. Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs [26].",

Since G value obtained for the predicted model in the present study is not less than \u2212 0.5, it is suggestive of satisfactory quality.

ProSA energy plot revealed negative energy distribution pattern being scored by the amino acid residues for the predicted structure (Supp Fig. 4). The Z score calculated by the ProSA tool for the model was \u2212 7.55, which is within the range of scores typically found for NMR derived structure for the native protein of similar size.

            "text": "The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease enzyme, which controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle, is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV [15]. Given the fragile health systems, new and re-emerging disease outbreaks such as the current COVID-19 epidemic can potentially paralyse health systems. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), facilities for undergoing research for COVID-19 should strictly implement the appropriate bio-safety practices inside the laboratory, due to the extremely high virus transmissibility. These factors make it extremely difficult for researchers to work with this virus, despite an urgent need to provide a therapy quickly. Computational studies at the preliminary level can save time and resources. The current study, thus, aims to predict theoretical structure for protease of COVID-19 and to explore further whether this homology modelled protein can serve as a target for protease inhibitor drugs such as remdesivir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir and ketoamide.",

Quality of the 3D structure of protease of COVID-19 generated by SWISS-MODEL server using 4MM3_B as the template was reasonably good based on the validation reports generated Verify3D, PROCHECK, and ProSA servers. Ramachandran plot analysis suggests the predicted 3D model of protease of COVID-19 as a good representation of protein structure with more than 90% of the residues located in the favourable region. The z-score calculated by ProSA tool for the model was also within the range of scores typically found for NMR derived structure for a native protein of similar size.",

However, the best recorded binding energy value was obtained for nelfinavir. Based on the lowest dock energy value scored by nelfinavir in relation to remaining ligands, this appears to be the drug of choice for treating COVID-19 infection. Since all the ligands have been docked with negative dock energy onto the target protein, it will be sensible to give equal importance to all these protease inhibitor ligands. The molecular interaction studies also showed that protease model of COVID-19 had more than 1 active site residue for remdesivir, while for remaining ligands the structure had only one active site residue each. In a recently reported study by Chang et al. [preprint; not peer reviewed], remdesivir has been identified to possess docking sites that strongly overlap with the protein pockets, and could be considered as a potential therapeutic agent. Also, one in vitro and a clinical study indicate that remdesivir, an adenosine analogue that acts as a viral protein inhibitor, has improved the condition in one patient  [8, 22]. A combination of the anti-retroviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir significantly improved the clinical condition of SARS\u2010CoV patients [2] and might be an option in COVID\u201019 infections. From the output of multiple sequence alignment analysis, it is evident that ligand binding sites (thr75, arg141, gln175and his176) were conserved across protease sequences of COVID-19, Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus and crystal structure of SARS-Coronovirus. Considering the global threat posed by COVID-19, and with no proven antiviral agent available for immediate relief, the current in silico study provide structural insights about the protease of COVID-19 and also its molecular interactions with some of the known protease inhibitors.",
