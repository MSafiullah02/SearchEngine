            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an important animal disease mainly affecting pigs, cattle, sheep, and other cloven-hoofed livestock. The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) belongs to the Picornaviridae family and consists of non-enveloped particles that contain a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 8.5 kb (Baranowski et al., 2003). Its translation yields a polyprotein that is subsequently processed by virus-encoded proteases to produce the structural and non-structural proteins required for virus assembly and replication (Vakharia et al., 1987, Abrams et al., 1995). One of the initial polypeptide cleavages, mediated by the 2A protein, is a co-translational cleavage at the N-terminus of the 2B protein (De Felipe et al., 2003). The P1-2A precursor is processed by viral protease 3C to produce the structural proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3. These proteins then self-assemble to form icosahedral, empty capsid-like particles, which contain 60 copies of each protein (Krausslich et al., 1990, Knipe et al., 1997). Encapsidation of viral RNA to produce mature virions is accompanied by the cleavage of VP0 to VP2 and VP4.",

            "text": "Inactivated whole virus vaccines play a key role in campaigns to control and eradicate FMD (Doel, 2003). However, vaccines produced from viral tissue culture are associated with the risk of virus release during vaccine production, and with the risk of improper inactivation of the virus, leading to vaccine-related outbreaks (Doel, 2003, Barteling and Vreeswijk, 1991). It is therefore preferable to develop novel vaccines which reduce these risks. Empty capsid-like particles of the FMDV are as antigenic and immunogenic as authentic FMDV, but produce no infection, because they have no RNA genome. A FMDV subunit vaccine based on empty capsid-like particles has been developed as one of the most promising alternatives to conventional vaccines (Li et al., 2008).",

Among these genes, the P1 sequence contains the B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte epitopes, allowing stimulation of the same cellular and humoral immune responses as those induced by complete virions. Myristoylation at the N-terminus of P12A is essential for efficient capsid assembly (Abrams et al., 1995, Krausslich et al., 1990), and the P1 sequence, as well as the 2A and 3C proteases are necessary for processing of the P1 polyprotein into VP1, VP3 and VP0. These are therefore included in the expression system. We then investigated the expression, processing, and assembly of FMDV empty capsid-like particles and analyzed their antigenicity and immunogenicity. These recombinant non-infectious FMDV empty capsid-like particles are potentially useful for the development of diagnostic techniques and vaccines.",

Although there have been many attempts to complete the assembly of FMDV empty capsid-like particles in the baculovirus expression system, no FMDV empty capsid-like particles have been detected in insect cells by electron microscopy. As shown in the previous study by Jae-Ku et al. (2007), only pentamer-like structures could be observed using electron microscopy. These authors presumed that the pH (about 6.2) of the insect cell medium influenced the assembly of the FMDV capsid structures. In our study, however, in addition to pentamer-like structures (small-sized particles under IEM), we also observed some empty capsid-like particles. This was consistent with the report of Ellard et al. (1999), who reported that empty capsids were more resistant to low pH than corresponding virions, and that some survived at pH 6.2. We collected and processed the infected cells using a lysis buffer (pH 7.4) that might have facilitated the assembly of empty capsid-like particles. These results further suggest a pivotal role for pH in the stability of FMDV empty capsids. It is also possible that empty capsids of the Asia I virus strain that we used were more resistant to acid conditions than those of the O type virus. Curry et al. (1995) found that acid-resistance varied among different strains of FMDV within the same serotype.",

The viral proteins were expressed by a recombinant baculovirus in HF cells, and expressed recombinant proteins were processed by 3C protease and self-assembled into empty capsid-like particles or intermediates, as observed by IEM and the appearance of the VP0, VP3 and VP1 bands in Western blotting. Sucrose gradient analysis indicated that 75S empty capsids were present in the 25% sucrose gradient, and this was confirmed by electron microscopy. According to the results of IS-ELISA and IFA, the expressed empty capsid-like particles were antigenic.",

Both FMDV-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were generated in these guinea pigs, but their levels were lower than those generated by the commercial vaccine. One possible reason for this was that we vaccinated animals with crudely extracted proteins containing empty capsids, and the quantity of empty capsid-like particles might have been lower than in the conventional inactivated vaccine. Further studies are therefore needed to improve the amount of protein expression and empty capsid assembly in insect cells. Based on our results, we can conclude that empty capsid-like particles or intermediates of Asia I FMDV assembled in insect cells exhibit good antigenicity and immunogenicity. These initial laboratory results are encouraging for the development of an empty capsid subunit vaccine for FMD. However, the conventional inactivated FMDV vaccine currently remains the most effective means of controlling and preventing FMD in epidemic areas.",
