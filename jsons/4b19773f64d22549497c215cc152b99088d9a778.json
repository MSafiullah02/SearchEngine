            "text": "Anemia is common in pediatric intensive care units (PICU). Severe anemia can significantly increase the risk of death. Only a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion can rapidly treat a severe anemia. In stable PICU patients, RBC transfusion is probably not required if the hemoglobin concentration is above 7 g/dL, unless the patient has a cyanotic cardiac condition. The trigger or goal that should be used to direct RBC transfusion therapy in unstable critically ill children remains undetermined, although some data suggest that RBC transfusion may help in the early treatment of unstable patients with sepsis if their ScvO 2 is below 70 % after mechanical ventilation, fluid challenge, and inotropes/vasopressors perfusions have been initiated. Plasma and platelets are used to prevent or to treat hemorrhage attributable to a coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. The risks and benefits of plasma and platelet concentrates in PICU patients are discussed. There is almost no evidence at the present time that might permit a strong recommendation with regard to the use of plasma and platelets in PICU. Good knowledge of transfusion reactions is required in order to appropriately estimate the cost/benefit ratio of transfusion. Nowadays, non-infectious serious hazards of transfusion (NISHOT) are more frequent and more challenging for pediatric intensivists than transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases. The decision to prescribe a transfusion must be tailored to individual needs and repeated clinical evaluation of each critically ill child.",

            "text": "In healthy animals undergoing acute hemodilution, evidence of heart dysfunction appears only once the Hb concentration drops below 3.3-4 g/dL [5, 6] . However, animals with 50-80 % coronary artery stenosis can show evidence of ischemic insult to the heart with a Hb concentration as high as 7-10 g/dL [7] . In human beings, Carson et al. [8] studied the outcome after surgery in 1,958 patients who declined transfusion for religious reasons; the odds ratio for death started to increase in those with prior ischemic heart disease when their pre-operative Hb concentration decreased below 10 g/dL. Carson et al. [9] also studied the outcome after surgery in 300 patients without prior ischemic heart disease who declined transfusion for religious reasons. The odds ratio for death started to increase when the post-operative Hb concentration dropped below 4 g/dL. There are some data describing the relationship between anemia in severely ill children and mortality. A prospective cohort study in Kenya of 1,269 hospitalized children with malaria showed that RBC transfusions decreased death rate if anemia was severe (Hb level < 4 g/dL) or if some dyspnea was associated with a Hb level < 5 g/dL [10] . In another study conducted in Kenya, Lackritz et al. [11] followed 2,433 hospitalized children younger than 12 years with chronic or acute anemia among which 20 % received RBC transfusions. Some benefit was observed when a RBC transfusion was given to patients with a Hb level below 4.7 g/dL, and if there were signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Given these results, guidelines were written suggesting that a RBC transfusion should be given to all children with a Hb level < 5 g/dL hospitalized in this Kenyan hospital. Subsequently, Lackritz et al. [12] undertook a prospective study in 1,223 consecutively hospitalized children. The Hb level was <5 g/dL in 303 patients. Of these patients, 116 (38 %) did not receive a transfusion, mostly because packed RBC units were not available. Each of these 303 children with severe anemia was paired with the next child hospitalized with a Hb level > 5 g/dL; none of the latter children with a Hb level > 5 g/dL received a RBC transfusion. Overall mortality was 30 % in the 303 children with a Hb level < 5 g/dL and 19.5 % in those with a Hb level > 5 g/dL (p < 0.01). Among the 303 patients with a Hb < 5 g/dL, mortality in transfused versus non transfused children was respectively 21.4 % and 41.4 % (p < 0.001). These studies suggest that there may be some benefit in keeping the Hb concentration of hospitalized children above 5 g/dL, though a higher threshold Hb concentration may be required in critically ill children.",

            "text": "While the risks of blood transfusion have been extensively characterized, the risks of anemia are poorly understood, especially in critically ill patients. Shander [7] described the consequences of anemia in the critically ill patient and explained the adaptive mechanisms involved. Anemia significantly decreases the O 2 carrying capacity of blood. In the normal host, the amount of O 2 delivered (DO 2 ) to tissue exceeds resting O 2 requirements by a factor of two to fourfold [13, 17] . When the Hb concentration falls below 10 g/ dL, several adaptive processes ensure a considerable physiologic reserve that maintains DO 2 in spite of major adversity. These adaptive processes include: (1) increased extraction of available O 2 , (2) increased cardiac output (elevated heart rate and stroke volume as well as decreased peripheral vascular resistance and blood viscosity) [18] , (3) redistribution of blood flow from non-vital organs to the heart and brain, at the expense of the splanchnic vascular bed, and (4) a right shift of the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve (leading to decreased O 2 affinity and therefore increased O 2 release) [13, 14, 18, 19] . All these mechanisms facilitate O 2 unloading to tissues. Severe anemia triggers additional adaptive mechanisms, which have limited compensation, such as an increase in cellular O 2 extraction. Indeed, this explains why there exists a critical threshold of DO 2 below which O 2 consumption (VO 2 ) begins to fall and selective vasoconstriction is observed, which favors blood flow to critical organs, namely the brain and heart, and deprives other organs, in particular those irrigated by the splanchnic vascular bed [13] .",

Cardiac compensation is limited when anemia is associated with hypovolemia or cardiac dysfunction. Disease processes such as sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) affect a number of adaptive mechanisms. In sepsis and MODS there is often a high metabolic rate and increased VO 2 that substantially limit the available O 2 reserve and may result in a situation where demand is not met if an additional metabolic stress occurs. In addition, these patients may also have impaired left ventricular function [20, 21] , and abnormal regulation of vascular tone [22, 23] , restricting DO 2 and redistribution of blood flow, respectively. Moreover, sepsis and MODS may compound the energy crisis observed in many critically ill patients by causing mitochondrial oxidative dysfunction, decreasing tissue O 2 extraction as well as its utilization [14, 18] . Finally, decreased RBC deformability, which can alter microcirculatory function, is also observed with sepsis and MODS.",

The energy requirements of young infants are much higher than those of adults [24] . This difference is mostly attributable to growth and implies a greater need for substrates including O 2 and nutrients. In addition to increased metabolic demands, there are also major differences in O 2 delivery between adults and children in the first years of life. Fetal Hb represents a greater proportion of total Hb during the first few months of life, which can cause a left shift of the Hb saturation curve and thus affect O 2 delivery to tissues. Physiologic decrease in Hb concentration is normal in newborns and partially explains the great variability in normal Hb values seen during the first weeks of life. During these weeks, myocardial compliance is decreased, which causes significant impairment in diastolic filling that can limit an increase in stroke volume when needed to maintain O 2 delivery. Moreover, the resting heart rate is relatively elevated in newborns (140 \u00b1 20/min) and in infants (130 \u00b1 20/min), which also limits their ability to increase cardiac output via increasing their heart rate. On the other hand, the health status of children prior to PICU entry is usually better than that of adults, which might explain the comparatively low mortality rates seen in PICUs (about 4 %) [25, 26] .",

Yet, paradoxically, erythropoietin plasma levels are often lower than expected in these patients. Several factors may be involved [28] . Certain inflammatory mediators may decrease and even block the production of erythropoietin. More particularly, in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which is present in >80 % of PICU patients [29] , high interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels can substantially attenuate erythropoietin production [7, 30] .

It is clear that RBCs are useful: they contain Hb, which transports O 2 to cells, and cells require O 2 to survive. Thus, it might seem reasonable to keep the blood Hb level and hematocrit of critically ill patients in the normal range. However, the safety of RBC transfusion has been increasingly questioned over the last few years, mostly because there is increased awareness among lay people and physicians regarding the risk of contracting infections such as HIV and hepatitis, and to some extent other potential transfusion-related complications such as bacterial contamination and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). It is less well recognized that transfusion of packed RBC units may modulate the inflammatory process in recipients (transfusion-related immuno-modulation or TRIM), which may increase the risk of developing nosocomial infections, sepsis and MODS [34] . Thus, it is important to ask what the risk/benefit and the cost/benefit ratios of RBC transfusion are in critically ill children.",

Conversely, RBCs bind more NO if local cellular VO 2 seems adequate, leading to local vasoconstriction. This function is almost immediately disturbed by storage (<3 h) [15, 16, 56, 57] , and most SNO-Hb is lost within 2 days of storage [55] .

Several pro-inflammatory molecules have been detected in stored non leukocytereduced RBC units, including complement activators [62] , cytokines [22, 42, 63] , O 2 free radicals [64, 65] , histamine [66] , lyso-phosphatidyl-choline species [67] and other bioreactive substances that modulate the inflammatory process.

The risk of TRIM may disappear if the RBC unit is leukocyte-reduced, the latter defined as less than 5 \u00d7 10 6 leukocytes per unit [2] . Pre-storage leukocyte-depletion is superior to reduction done by poststorage filtration at the bedside partially because pre-storage leukocyte-reduction is usually done under more rigorously controlled conditions and also because removal of white blood cells prior to storage reduces the time-dependent accumulation of pro-inflammatory mediators in the supernatant fluid [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] . Pre-storage leukocyte reduction is systematically undertaken in many countries (United Kingdom, Canada, etc.); in 2009, 28 out of 33 American blood banks (84.8 %) provided universal leukoreduction [90] . However, pre-storage leukoreduction does not prevent the production of all pro-inflammatory mediators detected in RBC units. For example, stored RBCs shed microvesicles in the supernatant. This process is an integral part of the RBC ageing process, is accelerated in stored RBC units and is not altered by pre-storage leukoreduction. These microvesicles (ectosomes) contain lipids that can amplify an inflammatory reaction [39] .",

In spite of these concerns, the clinical impact of TRIM is still a matter of considerable debate [34] .

            "text": "Tinmouth et al. [106] stated, \"There is strong laboratory evidence suggesting that prolonged RBC storage may be deleterious\". The results of many observational studies indeed suggest that an association exists between length of storage and outcome, but the published data are equivocal, and it must be underlined that observational studies overestimate the real benefit of a treatment by 30-60 % [130] . It is important to emphasize that finding an association does not imply a cause-effect relationship. Moreover, the number of RBC units and the severity of illness are also associated with increased mortality in transfused critically ill adults, and they are associated to each other. There is clearly some confounding by indication [131] , which further increases the complexity of the relationship between RBC storage time and adverse outcome, and which no multivariate analysis can deconstruct. Only randomized clinical trials can uncouple the relationship between severity of illness, number of transfusions and age of blood, and demonstrate a causeeffect relationship between RBC length of storage and adverse outcome in transfused critically ill patients. Several randomized clinical trials are presently addressing this question. The Age of Blood Evaluation (ABLE) study (ISRCTN44878718) is enrolling 2,510 critically ill adults since 2009 [132] . The Age of Red blood cell In Premature Infants (ARIPI) study (NCT00326924), which recruited 450 premature newborns who were allocated to receive either RBCs stored \u22647 days or transfusion therapy according to standard practice, was completed in Spring 2011 [133] . The \"Red Cell Storage Duration and Outcomes in Cardiac Surgery\" (NCT00458783) is a single-center RCT comparing outcomes in 2,800 patients allocated to receive RBCs stored for less than 14 or more than 20 days. The Red Cell Storage Duration Study (RECESS) (NCT00991341) is randomizing 1,434 cardiac surgery adult patients to receive either RBC units stored \u226410 days or \u226521 days [134] . The age of blood in children in PICU (ABC-PICU) study is in preparation and plans to recruit more than 1,500 critically ill children. Until hard evidence is available, the use of \"fresh\" rather than \"old\" blood cannot be recommended for ICU patients [135] .",

The stated reasons for administering RBCs included the presence of respiratory failure (84/103), active bleeding (67/103), hemodynamic instability (50/103), blood lactate level >2 mmol/L (10/103) or sub-optimal DO 2 (6/103). In many cases, more than one reason was specified, but in seven cases, no specific reason was given [138] . In another cohort study involving 985 consecutive critically ill children, the most significant observed determinants of a first RBC transfusion were a low hemoglobin level, an admission diagnosis of cardiac disease, an admission PRISM score >10 and the presence of MODS during PICU stay [139] . The following determinants of perioperative blood product-not only RBC-transfusion were detected in a prospective cohort study of 548 children undergoing cardiac surgery: younger age, higher preoperative hematocrit, complex surgery, low platelet count and longer duration of hypothermia [140] .",

Its basic principle is simple-a RBC transfusion should be given with the aim of attaining a given \"physiological\" goal. Many goals are suggested in the medical literature. Some are related to biomarkers reflecting global O 2 delivery (DO 2 ) and/or O 2 consumption (VO 2 ): DO 2 , VO 2 , blood lactate, Sv'O 2 (mixed venous O 2 saturation), ScvO 2 (central venous SO 2 ), O 2 extraction rate, etc. Some are related to regional (tissue) markers: near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), regional or tissue SO 2 (rSO 2 , StO 2 ), regional O 2 extraction rate, etc. Other goals have been considered, like heart rate variability, plethysmographic variability [141] and vascular endothelial growth factor levels [142] . Goaldirected RBC transfusion therapy might be the right clinical approach. There are indeed good data supporting goaldirected therapy and using ScvO 2 in unstable patients with severe sepsis and septic shock [143, 144] , but the role of RBC transfusion in ScvO 2 -directed goal therapy is unclear. There are no data supporting the use of other goals in other circumstances. Moreover, there is no consensus on what the best choice for a goal would be (maybe ScvO 2 in patients in severe sepsis and/or shock), nor any consensus on what threshold should be used for these goals.",

There have been two randomized clinical trials that evaluated RBC transfusion in severely ill children. The first randomized clinical trial included 106 African children hospitalized for a malarial crisis who had no congenital hemolytic anemia. In these patients with hematocrit levels ranging from 0.12 to 0.17, RBC transfusion did not improve mortality (1/53 vs 2/53) if there was no respiratory or cardiovascular compromise [11] .",

            "text": "The second randomized clinical trial, the Transfusion Requirements In Pediatric Intensive Care Units (TRIPICU) study, a large multicenter randomized non-inferiority clinical trial, included only stable or stabilized patients [145] . In this study, children were considered stable or stabilized if their mean arterial pressure was not less than two standard deviations below normal mean for age and if the cardiovascular support (vasopressors, inotropes and fluids) had not been increased for at least 2 h [145] . It must be underlined that in this definition of stable or stabilized patient, the respiratory and neurological status were not taken into account. The basic design of the TRIPICU study was quite simple. All critically ill children who presented a Hb level \u22649.5 g/dL within the first 7 days in the PICU were considered eligible for the study; they were included if they were hemodynamically stable and had no exclusion criteria. Children were randomized either to receive a transfusion only if the Hb was \u22649.5 g/dL (liberal group) or to receive a transfusion only if their Hb concentration was \u22647 g/dL (restrictive group). In the liberal group (320 patients), transfusion aimed for a posttransfusion Hb level of 11-12 g/dL while the aim was 8.5-9.5 g/dL in the restrictive strategic group (317 patients). Only pre-storage leukocyte-reduced packed RBC unit were used. The primary outcome measure was new/progressive MODS and death; all deaths were considered cases of progressive MODS. The number of new/progressive MODS in the restrictive and liberal groups where respectively 38 and 39. The 28-day of mortality was 14 in both groups. These results suggest that a threshold Hb of 7 g/dL can be safely applied to stable critically ill children. Accordingly, the principal recommendation of the TRIPICU study was to adopt \"a restrictive transfusion strategy in PICU patients whose condition is stable in the ICU\". One may challenge this recommendation and argue that some patient populations can differ from those in TRIPICU and require more RBC transfusions because they are sicker. Although not hard evidence, subgroup analyses have thus far found no justification to give more RBC transfusion to stable critically ill children even if their PRISM score is higher [145] , if patients present with a septic states (sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock) [146] , or if they are in PICU after undergoing a noncardiac surgery [147] . A before-after study also suggested that a restrictive policy is safe in burn children [148] .",

The Hb level observed while a patient is actively and acutely bleeding does not immediately reflect the volume of blood that has been lost; thus, the Hb concentration is not the best marker to guide transfusion on an emergency basis in such patients. There is no consensus on what must be done in patients who are unstable, but are not actively or acutely bleeding, like critically ill patients with uncontrolled septic shock or uncontrolled intracranial hypertension. Intensivists believe that a higher threshold Hb concentration is required in unstable patients [136, 149] . Few hard data support this point of view, other than two randomized clinical trials conducted in adults with severe sepsis or septic shock by Rivers et al. [143] and in children by de Oliveira et al. [144] These trials suggest that intensivists should try to maintain the ScvO 2 over 70 % and that RBC transfusion is required if fluid challenge (up to 80 mL kg within 6 h) and inotropes or vasopressors do not succeed in increasing the ScvO 2 above 70 %.",

            "text": "Patients with impaired ventricular function cannot increase their cardiac output as efficiently as other patients. Moreover, even at rest, O 2 extraction by myocardial cells is elevated, which implies a lessened coping capacity when anemia occurs. Thus, increasing the Hb level may be the only way to increase DO 2 and adequately support cardiac function in these patients. Support for this notion can be drawn from a retrospective study involving 1,958 adults who underwent surgery and refused blood transfusion for religious reasons. A substantially increased risk of death was associated with a low preoperative Hb level in cardiac patients when compared to those without cardiovascular disease [8] . In practice, the threshold Hb concentration observed before RBC transfusion is higher in the PICU during the postoperative period of cases of pediatric cardiac surgery than in other PICU patients [139] . Some recent publications question the statement that it is safe to give RBC transfusions to cardiac patients. Laboratory data suggest that RBC transfusion, even with fresh blood, can disturb the capacity of RBCs to release and capture nitric oxide, and to regulate the small blood vessels tone. Some clinical data suggest that critically ill adults with cardiovascular disease need a higher Hb concentration [150] , but other data suggest that RBC transfusions can cause more ischemia in patients with cardiac illness. For example, Murphy et al. [151] reported a statistically and clinically significant association between RBC transfusions and ischemia in 8,518 adults transfused during post-operative care of a cardiac surgery: the adjusted odds ratio was 3.35 (95 % CI: 2.68-4.35). This held true regardless of the hematocrit level before transfusion. Indeed, the proportion of patients with a hematocrit <21 % who developed an ischemic episode was 1.9 % in non transfused patients while it was 13.4 % in transfused patients. In comparison, the proportion of patients with a hematocrit over 27 % who developed an ischemic episode was 3.5 % in non-transfused patients and 11.6 % in those who were transfused.",

            "text": "What determinants to use in the post-operative care of pediatric cardiac surgery patients and whether they are useful are matters of great debate. There is consensus that the need for RBC transfusion in patients without cyanotic cardiac disease during the post-operative period must be addressed separately from those of patients with cyanotic heart disease. Many experts in pediatric cardiology believe in maintaining elevated Hb levels in children without cyanotic heart disease and advocate Hb levels of 12-13 g/dL in neonates and 10 g/dL in infants and children [152] . Other experts in Britain and France do not share this view and advocate lower Hb thresholds of 7-8 g/dL in stable children with non-cyanotic heart disease [2, 153] . There is little evidence regarding this issue. In year 2009, Harrington et al. [154] completed a scenario-based survey among Canadian pediatric cardiac surgeons, cardiologists and intensivists in order to ascertain their stated practice pattern with respect to RBC transfusion during the post-operative care after a pediatric cardiac surgery. Two scenarios in the questionnaire involved patients with non-cyanotic heart disease: a 6-day old having undergone arterial switch surgery and a 5-month old having undergone correction of a complete atrioventricular canal. Most respondents replied that a Hb lower than 10 g/dL would prompt them to transfuse RBCs in these patients. Their transfusion threshold increased Hb by 2.5 g/ dL if the patient was unstable, if he required ECMO, if active bleeding occurred, or if the ScvO 2 or the systemic blood pressure dropped suddenly. In the TRIPICU study, 63 patients with non-cyanotic cardiac disease were enrolled in the restrictive group and 62 in the liberal group [155] . New/ progressive MODS was observed in eight patients in the former and four patients in the latter (p = 0.36); there were two deaths in each group at 28 days post-randomization. Thus, the only presently available evidence from this subgroup analysis suggests that a Hb level above 7 g/dL is safe for critically ill children with non-cyanotic heart disease if they are stable. A higher threshold Hb level is probably required in unstable patients.",

The authors specifically attributed the benefit seen to a decreased right to left shunt and did not consider the possibility that benefit could have been due to an increased VO 2 [61] . Interestingly, experience with bloodless surgery for complex cyanotic defects suggests that cardiac surgery can be safely performed with a lower level of Hb without evidence of increased risk [156, 157] . Cholette et al.

One death was observed in the liberal group. The median lactate blood level was 1.4 \u00b1 0.05 mmol/L in both groups. Peak blood lactate was also almost identical (3.1 \u00b1 1.5 versus 3.2 \u00b1 1.3 mmol/L). However, the O 2 extraction rate was slightly higher in the restrictive group (31 % \u00b1 7 % versus 26 % \u00b1 6 %) with a difference that was statistically significant (p = 0.013), but not necessarily clinically significant.

The concept of bloodless medicine and blood conservation are two aspects of blood management that all intensivists should integrate into their clinical practice. Blood conservation refers to limiting the volume of blood lost by patients. Repetitive phlebotomy may contribute significantly to blood loss (7.1 \u00b1 5.3 mL/day, 34 \u00b1 37 mL per PICU stay) [159] . Limiting and consolidating blood tests, closed blood sampling, use of pediatric blood collection tubes, and microanalysis techniques requiring small sample volumes (<0.5 mL) can all be very effective ways to minimize blood loss [160, 161] . The concept of bloodless medicine refers to all the strategies that can be used to provide medical care without allogeneic blood transfusion. Both concepts are discussed in greater detail in a separate chapter in this textbook.",

It is obvious that more research must be undertaken to provide scientific data before one can establish evidence-based guidelines. Meanwhile, decisions related to transfusion should be driven by physiological need rather than a specific Hb trigger, a decision making process advocated by the National Institutes of Health [162] , the American College of Physicians [48] and a group of Canadian experts [163] . Because markers of \"physiological needs\" are not characterized in critically ill patients, the Hb level is still pivotal to the decision making process of intensivists who are considering RBC transfusion [1, 136, 137, 164] . In practice, we recommend the following strategy for hemodynamically stable critically ill children without cyanotic heart disease [165] : Blood gas machines should not be used for Hb estimation on which to base a transfusion request. RBC transfusion is required in most instances if the Hb concentration is <5 g/dL. RBC transfusion is probably useful if the Hb concentration is between 5 and 7 g/dL. For Hb levels ranging from 7 to 9.5 g/dL, there appears to be no overall benefit in transfusing RBCs. No RBC transfusion is required if the Hb concentration is >9.5 g/dL.",

There is, however, no consensus on what this threshold should be. It is also possible that a higher Hb concentration may be required early in their course for patients with severe sepsis. Rivers et al. [143] in adults and de Oliveira et al. [144] in children showed that aggressive and early (first 6 h) goal-driven protocol therapy directed at attaining a ScvO 2 greater than 70 mmHg (equivalent to 65 mmHg for mixed venous saturation) [166] improves outcome in patients with severe sepsis. In the majority of patients, such early-goal therapy was achieved only if the hematocrit was kept above 0.30 during these six \"golden\" hours. The recommendations detailed above this paragraph apply after these golden hours, once the patient is stabilized. The decision to prescribe a RBC transfusion must be adapted to specific situations and must take into account determinants other than the Hb concentration, such as the severity of cases or the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction (high blood lactate level), a frequent occurrence in sepsis.",

Most countries have updated the constituents of the solutions used.

If the volume of packed RBCs needed to reach the Hb targeted is greater than the volume of one unit of packed RBCs, blood should be transfused one unit at a time and the Hb measured again prior to administration of additional packed RBCs. Given the fact that Hb and Ht values equilibrate within 30 min in transfused patients who are not actively bleeding [169] , it would be appropriate to allow for this delay prior to verification of post-transfusion Hb level. A packed RBC unit can be subdivided into smaller units-either half units or four to five aliquots-to avoid waste (Pedi-Pak\u00ae, Genesis BPS, is frequently used in North-America). Sterile preparation of these fractionated or partial units may allow for remaining blood to be reserved for the same patient until the expiry date, thus minimizing exposure to multiple donors. A packed RBC unit must be given within 4 h after leaving the hospital blood bank. Fractionated units, which are prepared in a sterile manner, can be kept as long as the original unit. Table 19 .1 summarizes permissible choices of ABO/Rh blood components according to recipient ABO/Rh blood groups. An ABO/Rh blood group is mandatory before any blood component transfusion. In addition a cross-match (electronic or serologic according to institutional policy) is required before a RBC transfusion. It takes 5-10 min to ascertain the ABO and Rh status of a patient (type) and up to 60 min to complete pre-transfusion testing of a recipient including ABO/Rh typing, antibody screening and cross matching. In acute life-threatening situations requiring rapid transfusion, there may not be sufficient time for complete pre-transfusion testing. In these situations, ORh \u2212 RBC and/ or AB plasma should be administered. The risk of severe hemolytic reaction to non cross-matched RBC units is low in patients who have never been exposed to allogenic RBCs (i.e. who have never been transfused or pregnant); however in emergency situations, a reliable medical history is often unavailable. For patients who have been previously transfused or who are pregnant, it is difficult to give a precise figure as to the risk, and this will vary with individual patients (e.g. number of previous transfusions, availability of previous records, nature of the underlying disease like immunosuppressed patient versus a sickle cell patient). The physician must weigh risks and benefits. However, in truly lifethreatening situations, most physicians would proceed with transfusion of non cross-matched blood. If large amounts of uncross-matched packed RBC units are transfused, the hospital blood bank might recommend that similar units continue to be administered for a while (a protocol is usually implemented to deal with massive transfusion in most hospitals).",

In practice, packed RBC units are warmed to 37 \u00b0C before transfusion to a small patient (<10 kg) or if the amount given constitutes >20-30 % of the recipient's blood volume. In other situations (i.e. larger child, slower infusion rate), the blood will warm sufficiently at room temperature while being infused. Warming packed RBCs decreases viscosity (7 % decrease for each 1 \u00b0C increase), thus lowering the resistance through the catheter used; the clinical relevance of this remains to be determined.

Whole blood can be reconstituted by combining one unit of packed RBC with a compatible unit of fresh frozen plasma [84] . Worldwide, most blood suppliers do not routinely provide whole blood. However, the transfusion of Rh + platelets can be given to an Rh \u2212 receiver when no Rh \u2212 platelets are available. Anti-D immunoglobulins should then be considered, especially in women of childbearing potential whole blood could be considered in the following four situations: (1) hemorrhagic shock; (2) exchange transfusion in a newborn; (3) administration of an autologous unit (i.e. blood collected from the patient a few days or weeks prior to reinfusion at the time of elective surgery); (4) administration of blood donated by a family member and dedicated to a given patient. Some investigators have claimed that the use of fresh whole blood is associated with less post-operative blood loss [177] . Whole blood less than 48 h old is systematically used in some hospitals for cardiac surgery, mostly to prime the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit [152] . However a randomized clinical trial has shown that \"the use of fresh whole blood for cardiopulmonary bypass priming has no advantage over the use of a combination of packed red cells and freshfrozen plasma during surgery for congenital heart disease\" [178] .

The volume of washed RBC units depends on the hematocrit.

Washed RBC units can be used to prevent transfusion reactions in patients who have presented severe or recurrent allergic reactions. Some practitioners use washed RBC units because they believe they are free of potassium. However, strong hemolysis is observed in washed RBC units; the concentration of potassium units increased rapidly after they are washed, and get to the prewashed potassium concentration within 24 h [179] .",

Many intensivists consider that the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage is significant in mechanically ventilated patients if the platelet count is <50,000/mm 3 , and most will prescribe platelet transfusion in such instances (although this has never been substantiated by clinical studies). A threshold of 100,000/mm 3 is generally recommended for patients with multiple trauma, central nervous system injury [196] , or for patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [2, 84] . In patients with thrombocytopenia due to decreased platelet production, prophylactic platelet transfusion should be considered if the platelet count is <10,000/mm 3 or if there are additional risk factors for bleeding.",

Nevertheless ABO incompatible platelets (i.e. platelets with A and/or B antigens given to a donor with a corresponding antibody) are usually clinically effective. However there are several reports of acute intravascular hemolysis following the transfusion of platelet concentrates containing ABO antibodies incompatible with the recipient's RBC [203, 204] . Therefore ABO-matched platelets should be used in pediatric patients especially for neonates and small children where the volume of plasma may be relatively large with respect to the patient's total blood volume. If ABO-matched platelets are not available, units with plasma compatible with the recipient's RBCs should be chosen. If this is also not possible, units with low titers of anti-A or anti-B should be selected or alternatively the plasma can be removed from the platelet concentrate (i.e. use a volume reduced platelet concentrate) [2] . Platelets do not carry Rh antigen, but concentrates contain RBCs in numbers sufficient to sensitize the recipient. An anti-D vaccine (Win Rho SDR\u00ae) should be given if the recipient is a Rh \u2212 woman of childbearing potential and the donor is Rh + [2] . Each 120 mcg of Rh-immunoglobulin covers 12 mL whole blood (6 mL RBC) and lasts approximately 21 days [205] . Tobian et al. [206] reported that the incidence of allergic transfusion reactions to unmanipulated apheresis platelets is 5.5 %, and that concentrating and washing reduced this incidence to 0.5 %. Recipients of HLA-matched platelets should receive irradiated platelets in order to prevent graft versus host disease.",

The criterion of \"no pre-existing ALI before transfusion\" means that TRALI cannot be diagnosed when an ALI is already present. Clinically, TRALI resembles ARDS and involves respiratory symptoms such as hypoxemia, dyspnea and frothy sputum as well as hypotension, tachycardia and fever [216] . Chest radiograph findings are also similar to those seen in ARDS and ",

Early onset complications of massive transfusion [199] Definition of massive transfusion : administration of more than one blood volume of blood products within a 24 h period show generalized opacities. In 90 % of cases, the reaction appears within 1-2 h after a transfusion is started. HLA antibodies and/or granulocyte antibodies are positive in 65-83 % of tested donors [216, 219] . Respiratory symptoms usually disappear within 48-96 h, which is different from the progression typically seen in ARDS [220] . All blood products containing some plasma can cause a TRALI, but frozen plasma (50 %) and packed RBC units (31 %) are more frequently involved than platelet concentrates (17 %) [216] . The incidence of TRALI was between 1/1,000 and 1/8,000 transfusions in the 90s and the early 2000 [221] [222] [223] . A recent surveillance study completed in 2010 reported an incidence rate of 1.8 TRALI per 100,000 transfusions in Canadian children [224] . In this study, three out of the four cases of TRALI occurred in PICU patients. Furthermore, two cases occurred in neonates who underwent cardiac surgery, raising the possibility that these patients are at greater risk of TRALI.",

The most popular hypotheses include: (1) a reaction between donor antibodies (antigranulocyte, anti-HLA class I or II) and recipient antigens that initiates an inflammatory reaction in the lungs; (2) the neutrophils of a recipient primed by surgery, trauma or an infection overreact when exposed to inflammatory activators (anti-leukocyte, biologically active lipids, etc.) that are either present in the donor's blood or that were produced during storage [225, 226] . Recent studies suggest that the two theories might be somewhat linked [227] . This has lead to the development of a unifying model (the threshold model) by Bux et al. [228] According to this model, the level of priming of neutrophils, either directly or through activation of the pulmonary endothelium, by a patient clinical condition and by substances (including antibodies) present in the transfused component, is responsible for triggering TRALI in a recipient.",

The diagnostic criteria advocated by the panel of experts in 2004 [218] exclude the possibility that a TRALI appears in a patient who already presents an ALI or an ARDS when a RBC transfusion is initiated, which is frequent in the PICU. There is indeed some evidence that a TRALI should also be considered in some patients with ALI/ARDS before a transfusion if their respiratory dysfunction deteriorates significantly during or after a transfusion. Marik et al. [234] suggested expanding the definition of TRALI in ICU to ALI/ ARDS observed within 72 h after the transfusion of a blood product: they reported that such \"delayed TRALI syndrome\" occurred in up to 25 % of critically ill adults receiving a blood transfusion. Church et al. [235] also reported an association between the transfusion of plasma and/or packed RBC units and ALI/ARDS. The bioactive substances contained in packed RBC and plasma units can cause or add to the severity of cases of ALI/ARDS [235] [236] [237] . Further investigation is required to better characterize the epidemiology, the mechanisms and the clinical impact of transfusionrelated delayed TRALI syndrome in PICU.",

The incidence rate of TACO in PICU is unknown, but in 2010, TACO was the most common transfusion-related death in UK. According to the British Haemovigilance System (SHOT), a TACO is present if at least four of the five following criteria are met within 6 h after a transfusion: (1) acute respiratory distress; (2) tachycardia; (3) increased blood pressure; (4) acute or worsening pulmonary edema; (5) evidence of positive fluid balance <www.shotuk.org/shot-reports>. All patients with cardiac disease or chronic anemia (Hb < 5 g/dL) are at risk, including newborns. Circulatory overload can be prevented to some extent by slowing the rate of transfusion (to less than 1 mL/kg/h) in patients at risk. Other modalities include pre-emptive diuretics and splitting components into smaller aliquots. Treatment consists in cessation of the transfusion, attention to fluid balance, use of diuretics if necessary and supportive ventilatory measures.",

            "text": "Fever is the most frequent reaction to a blood product transfusion. It is not dangerous unless it is caused by a hemolytic reaction or a bacterial contamination. Its frequency after transfusion of a packed RBC unit is about 1 % [163, 240] and can be as high as 10 % after transfusion of platelet concentrates [241] . A febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) is defined as a de novo rise in temperature equal to or greater than 1 \u00b0C that cannot be explained by the patient's clinical condition (i.e. other causes of fever must be ruled out). The fever can be accompanied by dyspnea, tachycardia, headache, anxiety, rigors (shivering) as well as nausea and vomiting [220] . These symptoms usually appear at the end or just after the end of transfusion. FNHTR is thought to be caused primarily by two mechanisms involving white blood cells. Firstly, FNHTR may occur when HLA antibodies present in a recipient react with donor white blood cells present in a RBC or platelet component. This leads to complement activation and cytokine release, which results in the typical symptoms of a FNHTR. Alternately (and likely more commonly, at least in the case of platelet transfusions) cytokines are released from white blood cells during the storage of blood components; when transfused, these cytokines can lead to a FNHTR in the recipient. The proportion of patients with fever episodes decreased from 24.7 % prior to the introduction of the pre-storage leukoreduction program to 22.5 % following its implementation in Canada (OR 0.88; 95 % CI 0.82-0.95; p = 0.001) [242] . It may be useful to use washed blood products for patients with a history of repeated and severe FNHTR to leukocyte-reduced blood products. Acetaminophen can be used to minimize fever, but premedication with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine or steroids is not helpful [243, 244] .",

Acute hemolytic reactions are rare (1/26,914 according to MacDonald et al. [207] ), but may be fatal. The destruction of RBCs in the recipient is attributed to immunological incompatibility (donor RBC antigens reacting with recipient antibodies). Acute hemolytic reactions are usually caused by the transfusion of an incompatible blood product, an adverse event that is attributable to error in 86 % of cases. Acute hemolysis due to ABO incompatibility is the leading cause of severe reaction to RBC transfusion (1/108,968 RBC transfusions) [207] ; however, other erythrocyte antigens can be involved (D/d, C/c, E/e, Kell, etc.). Hemolysis is associated with hemoglobinuria and acute anemia. Fever is also frequent, as well as shivering, discomfort and general pain. In severe cases, hypotension, shock, renal insufficiency and DIC can be observed. A mortality rate as high as 10 % is reported [197] . In order to prevent such hemolytic reactions, correct labeling of the blood sample for pre-transfusion testing is essential and, at the time of transfusion, compatibility between donor and recipient including ABO and Rh groups, the identification number of the unit as well as the identity of the recipient (name and hospital chart number) must be meticulously verified and routinely double-checked at the patient's bedside.",

The risk for severe allergic reactions is greater in patients with IgA antibodies associated with IgA deficiency. Severe reactions usually occur more rapidly than mild reactions. Fever is usually not observed, but a rash is possible. Severe allergic reaction may be life-threatening [197] . It is advisable to administer antihistamines prior to transfusing patients who have presented repeated minor allergic reactions to blood products; the use of corticosteroids as well as using washed packed RBC units or platelet concentrates may also be considered particularly for severe or repeated reactions that do not respond to premedication with antihistamines.

            "text": "All blood product administration involves a potential for transmission of infections. Bacterial contamination of blood products is the cause of 10 % of deaths attributable to transfusions. The risk of bacterial contamination is higher for platelets (1/31,189 units) than for RBC units (1/65,381 units) [207] , as platelets are stored at 22 \u00b0C while RBCs are stored at 4 \u00b0C. Many preventive techniques have been implemented in the last years in order to decrease the risk of bacterial infections caused by platelet transfusions, which have significantly improved the safety of platelets transfusions. For example, the incidence in the Province of Quebec of probable and definite transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections associated with whole blood-derived platelets decreased from 1 in 2,655 in 2000 to 1 in 58,123 five-unit pools in 2008 (p < 0.001) [245] . It is estimated that transfusion-related sepsis occurs in 15-25 % of patients who receive contaminated platelet concentrates [211] . Potential sources of contamination include unrecognized bacteremia in the donor due to Yersinia enterolytica or Salmonella gastroenteritis, Staphylococcus aureus infection caused by dental manipulation, contamination of donated blood by normal skin flora during collection and infection occurring due to manipulation of blood products. The most common germs are: Gram negative bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas species, and Gram positive like Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus cereus. The reaction usually occurs during or within a few hours after transfusion and can cause milder symptoms such as fever and shivering as well as more severe complications such as septic shock. The risk of bacteremia is more important with prolonged storage time. When a bacterial contamination is suspected, the transfusion must be stopped immediately, wide spectrum antibiotics must be given (third generation cephalosporin or beta-lactam in combination with aminoglycoside) and supportive treatment administered. The blood bank must be informed immediately, as other blood products from the same donor may need to be withdrawn. Culture of the blood product itself is indicated. Several blood suppliers now perform bacterial detection studies on platelet concentrates prior to their release into hospital inventories, but even this technique does not detect all contaminated units.",

The pathogenesis is unclear and presumably is related to the presence of platelet-specific antibodies in the recipient following previous exposure to human platelets. These antibodies destroy both transfused platelets and the recipient's own platelets. Severe hemorrhage can occur in the gut, urinary tract and/or brain. The thrombocytopenia is refractory to platelet transfusion and the mortality rate is reported to be as high as 8 % [256] . Giving platelet concentrates that are free of the implicated platelet antibodies to susceptible patients can prevent this type of reaction. The thrombocytopenia appears suddenly, but it is usually self-limiting. Steroids, plasmapheresis and immunoglobulins may be required in severe cases. The acute onset of severe thrombocytopenia following transfusion can also occur when a plasma-containing component from a donor with anti-platelet antibodies is administered to a recipient possessing the corresponding platelet antigen.",

            "text": "TA-GvHD is a rare adverse event that can be extremely severe [214, 262] . The \"Serious hazard of transfusion (SHOT) initiative\" run in United Kingdom reported that 8 out of 22 deaths (36 %) attributed to a transfusion were caused by a TA-GvHD [263] . TA-GvHD has occurred in two settings. The first clinical setting in which TA-GvHD occurs is severely immunocompromised patients (such as those with congenital immune deficiency syndromes or cancer patients receiving chemotherapy) or preterm infants with immature immune systems unable to reject donor T lymphocytes found in cellular blood components [264] . Hence the donor T lymphocytes are able to engraft, proliferate, and then attack recipient tissues. An ICU group at particular risk is DiGeorge patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery for congenital cardiac anomalies associated with this syndrome. Surprisingly HIV infected patients are not at risk for TA-GvHD. The second clinical setting in which TA-GvHD occurs is the setting in which donor lymphocytes are able to engraft because they are not recognized as foreign by a nonimmunosuppressed receiver. This occurs when the donor is HLA homozygous for one of the HLA haplotypes present in an HLA heterozygous recipient. This situation can occur in a population with relative HLA homogeneity (e.g. the Japanese) or in the setting of directed donations from biologic relatives or if HLA-matched platelets are given to treat a patient with immune refractoriness to unmatched platelets [2, 264] . Symptoms usually appear 8-28 days after transfusion and include fever, skin rash, diarrhea and hepatic dysfunction. A severe pancytopenia can be caused by bone marrow dysfunction. TA-GvHD is fatal in 90 % of patients if untreated, a fatality rate that is significantly higher than with GvHD related to bone marrow transplantation [84] . Lymphocyte multiplication can be blocked by irradiation, which dramatically reduces and probably eliminates the risk of contracting TA-GvHD. Leukoreduction of cellular components is not sufficient to prevent TA-GvHD.",

Thus units with CPDA-1 can be stored up to 35 days while units with CPD may only be stored for 21 days (28 days fir CPD-2). Additive solutions containing more adenine, such as AS-1 (Adsol\u00ae), AS-3 (Nutricel\u00ae) and SAG-M are being used with increasing frequency in North American and European countries. The contents of AS-1 and SAG-M are similar to that of CPDA-1 except that they contain mannitol to decrease RBC lysis. Packed RBC units stored in additive solutions have a shelf-life of 35-42 days, depending on country-specific regulations for permitted storage (42 days in North-America, 35-42 in European countries)",
