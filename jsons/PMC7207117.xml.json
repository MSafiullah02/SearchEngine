            "text": "Modern society, despite the advancement of technology, relies on goods and services derived from nature \u2013 not only for mental and physical regeneration and for the cultural and educational values nature offers to humans and food provision, but also, more importantly, for clean air, soil regeneration, water purification and disaster risk reduction (Alcock, White, Wheeler, Fleming, & Depledge, 2014; Kabish et al., 2016; Liu, Chen, & Peng, 2014; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). One of the key challenges of the modern world is to provide these services to the growing population of cities (World Health Organization, 2016). This brings urban green spaces (UGS) to the center of attention as a premise of citizens\u2019 wellbeing (European Environment Agency, 2009, 2010a, 2012; European Environment Agency & Joint Research Centre, 2013; Kim & Miller, 2019), and a sine qua non for cities\u2019 long-term sustainability, built on a range of regulatory services recognized as nature-based solutions (Cohen-Shacham, Walters, Janzen, & Maginnis, 2016; European Commission, 2015). Moreover, access to UGS has become a pressing environmental-justice issue in densely populated areas (\u0141aszkiewicz, Kronenberg, & Marci\u0144czak, 2018). However, city managers are confronted with multiple barriers to establishing new green spaces, mostly due to spatial and financial restrictions (Kronenberg, 2015). The most commonly desired UGS \u2013 urban parks and forests \u2013 are frequently not sufficient to meet the demand for services due to their location (usually the outskirts of city centers, or even in suburban areas) or limited size or location options, hence the role of alternative green areas has been highlighted, e.g. cemeteries (Nordh, Evensen, & Skar, 2017), allotment gardens (Soga et al., 2017), or residential greenery (Battisti, Pille, Wachtel, Larcher, & S\u00e4umel, 2019). One recently studied option involves considering various patches of vegetated areas scattered throughout the city which are not included in the city\u2019s planning documents as UGS, but provide numerous benefits to residents (walking paths and pet areas, recreational spaces, urban agriculture lots). Such places are referred to as informal green spaces (IGS). Although they are defined in various ways, in general they are all neglected areas which are not formally recognized or planned for recreational use by inhabitants (Pietrzyk-Kaszy\u0144ska, Czepkiewicz, & Kronenberg, 2017; Rupprecht & Byrne, 2014a, 2014b). It is also possible to create new green infrastructure in dense cities on urban vacant land through smart growth principles such as in-filling, brownfield and greyfield redevelopment/recycling (European Environment Agency, 2016; Kim, 2018).",

This is due to the processes of ecological succession which structurally and functionally differentiate them from man-made and artificially maintained green spaces (Kowarik, 2013; Mathey, Arndy, Banse, & Rink, 2018). IGS also have a potential to act as connectors within a larger green network, providing an ecological connectivity of green spaces as a basis for sustainable and restorative development of a city (e.g. Krauze & Wagner, 2019). Even if they are not intended for recreational use, studies show that IGS offer opportunities for spending free time (Brun et al., 2018; Kremer, Hamstead, & McPhearson, 2013; Rall & Haase, 2011; Rupprecht, Byrne, Ueda, & Lo, 2015; Unt & Bell, 2014) and enable residents to interact with nature (Rupprecht et al., 2015).",

This can be an especially important issue in cities in the transitional phase with shrinking and aging populations, resulting in higher numbers of vacant lots and a loss of green areas (Kronenberg, Krauze, & Wagner, 2017).

Direct use is strongly related to residents\u2019 perception and how they subjectively assess the area. The benefits of city parks have been explored the most thoroughly (e.g. Bedimo-Rung, Mowen, & Cohen, 2005; Brown, Schebella, & Weber, 2014; Dou, Zhen, De Groot, Du, & Yu, 2017; Langemeyer, Baro, Roebeling, & Gomez-Baggethun, 2015; Rall, Bielin, Zytynska, & Haase, 2017). Studies generally focus on the cultural ecosystem services provided by formal green spaces (see the Appendix A). Work covering citizens\u2019 recognition of the regulating services provided by urban parks and greenery is much scarcer (e.g. Bertram & Rehdanz, 2015; Jim & Chen, 2006; see the Appendix A). IGS have been considered even less frequently (e.g. Mathey et al., 2018; Weber, Kowarik, & Saumel, 2014; Table 1, Appendix A). Little is also known about the needs of local residents in terms of redevelopment of IGS (Mathey et al., 2018). As the attractiveness of the space plays an important role in how people consider the value of greenery, the perception of IGS can be highly diverse. They are perceived as problematic areas which are aesthetically undervalued (e.g. unpleasant spaces, perceived as a landfill or a source of social problems) (Brun et al., 2018), untidy and dangerous due to the structure of the vegetation (Jorgensen, Hitchmough, & Dunnett, 2007; Mathey et al., 2018). Conversely, some people see IGS as useful, valuable, highly natural spaces (Brun et al., 2018), characterized by wildness, uniqueness (Pietrzyk-Kaszy\u0144ska et al., 2017), biodiversity, and tranquility (Rupprecht et al., 2015).",

The rapid development initiated in the second half of the 19th century resulted in dense urban development, air, soil and water pollution, and the canalization of watercourses. The economic and social transition initiated in 1989 has led to economic depression (high unemployment, soaring inflation, a significant decrease of GDP) (Kronenberg et al., 2017; Stawasz, 2016), but it also introduced new socio-cultural patterns, which have caused further urbanization and urban sprawl (Kronenberg & Bergier, 2012; Wagner & Breil, 2013). Despite significant improvement after the accession to the European Union, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is still struggling with unemployment (6.3% in 2017), low GDP per capita (59 347 PLN in 2016) and relatively low average monthly gross wages (4462.50 PLN in 2017, ca 1000 Euro). This indicators classifies \u0141\u00f3d\u017a below the national average and averages for Polish towns over 450 thousand inhabitants (PwC, 2015, 2019; Statistical Office in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, 2018; Szukalski, Martinez-Fernandez, & Weyman, 2013). Different stages of the city's development, as well as its economic and political history, have led to negative effects on the wellbeing of its inhabitants, conditioned by environmental goods and environmental risk (Krauze & W\u0142odarczyk-Marciniak, 2018; Kupry\u015b-Lipi\u0144ska, Kuna, & Wagner, 2014).",

By 2015, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a lost almost 20% of its population, meanwhile, in other large Polish cities, the process was much less dynamic (Krzysztofik & Szmytkie, 2018). The forecast indicates further decline in population by 2050, resulting in a loss of youth and skilled professionals for the region (Szukalski et al., 2013). It is also experiencing accelerated population aging, in 2017 there were 22.3% of population aged 65 years and more, and by 2050 it may reach about 37.5% (Statistical Office in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, 2018). \u0141\u00f3d\u017a also struggles with high mortality and morbidity rates, a low fertility rate and low migration attraction (Perek-Bia\u0142as, Sagan, Stronkowski, & Szukalski, 2017; Szukalski, 2012, 2015). Furthermore, the city is highly divided in terms of place of residence. The central zone is mainly home to low-income and unemployed residents, while the upper and middle classes tend to live outside the old core of the city. This is due to the fact that instead of allocating funds to the reconstruction and revitalization of the pre-war housing stock during the communist period (after the Second World War), efforts were instead focused on building vast residential areas on the outskirts of the city (Marci\u0144czak & Sagan, 2011). This has led to a societal degradation of the city center and to collapse of its physical attributes (Marci\u0144czak & Sagan, 2011). The differences between the city center and its outskirts are also reflected in the health of residents of different zones, e.g. children from the center have a significantly lower body mass and height (Rosset et al., 2012). A similar effect can be noted for the prevalence of asthma in both adults and children, as well as seasonal rhinitis in children (Kupry\u015b & Kuna, 2003; Kupry\u015b-Lipi\u0144ska, Elgalal, & Kuna, 2009; Kupry\u015b-Lipi\u0144ska, Elgalal, & Kuna, 2010).",

According to the same studies, 77% of those citizens who do not have formal green spaces in their surroundings do have access to IGS. The location of formal green areas in the vicinity of city residents, a high proportion of greenery not being included in urban green space planning and governance, and unequal access to greenery, all make \u0141\u00f3d\u017a an important location for analyzing the benefits and management options of IGS (Table 1\n).",

Preliminary studies were carried out in 40 IGS. Fenced sites, those with limited access, and those located within housing estates were excluded. In total, five locations were selected for further research (Table 2\n, Fig. 1\n). Most of the sites were located in or adjacent to the low income areas of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a with a predominance of tenement houses (only the fifth location is outside the degraded area, but the poverty and unemployment rates are similar, the difference is manifested mostly in the predominance of blocks of flats over tenement houses). The majority of inhabitants do not have access to private and community gardens, nor formal green areas of appropriate quality and size with adequate infrastructure in close distance. Two of them represented street greenery (with and without trees, with low levels of maintenance) and three abandoned, derelict sites at different succession phases (with spontaneous pioneer or ruderal vegetation, no maintenance).

It should be noted that our results do not indicate levels of foraging; they simply show that just 12% of respondents admitted that IGS could be used for urban foraging. This may reflect concerns about whether urban plants are suitable for eating (Russo, Escobedo, Cirella, & Zerbe, 2017), e.g. due to metal contamination (e.g. Antisari, Orsini, Marchetti, Vianello, & Gianquinto, 2015; S\u00e4umel et al., 2012). This bias is unfortunate because urban foraging could be an important and widely accessible way of handling environmentally-friendly production and transport of food, and tackling social issues such as poverty (Landor-Yamagata, Kowarik, & Fischer, 2018; Russo et al., 2017; Shackleton, Hurley, Dahlberg, Emery, & Nagendra, 2017). More information may be needed on the subject, including issues favoring the development of IGS which may provide food provisioning, for example by introducing natural barriers to pollution (e.g. planting trees along the street (Al-Dabbous & Kumar, 2014)).",

In our study, respondents showed a high awareness of ecosystem services of IGS; this is related not only to their age or education, but also to the features of the site (e.g. tree coverage, management level). However, socio-demographic factors appear to be statistically related with just three UES: aesthetic function, mental health benefits and noise reduction. The aesthetic function of IGS was more highly recognized by younger and highly educated people. Elderly respondents were more likely to recognize the positive influence of IGS on mental health and noise reduction. This could be related to generational variance and age-related needs, which is linked with a higher physical and mental vulnerability of the elderly. The findings are concordant with those by Van den Berg and van Winsum-Westra (2010) and Van den Berg and Koole (2006), where people with an academic education rated wild spaces as more beautiful, and elderly people displayed relatively high preferences for managed natural settings. Contrary to the findings of Graca et al. (2018), we did not find gender-related differences in attitudes towards IGS.",

We speculate that this may be due to the fact that, unlike other locations, these areas are minimally managed by the city authorities (perhaps mown a few times a year), which is more often perceived as attractive (\u00d6z\u00fcnger & Kendle, 2006). Additionally, street greenery protects against pluvial flooding (through retention of rainwater), which is a highly recognized problem in densely built-up city centers during rain events (Wagner & Zalewski, 2009). The answers indicated that the presence of trees on land parcels is particularly associated with noise reduction, temperature regulation and air purification, which may be due to the responders\u2019 beliefs/feelings or the increasing availability and accessibility of scientific evidence. The findings are directly in line with research which provides evidence that urban trees reduce heat stress (Bowler, Buyung-Ali, Knight, & Pullin, 2010), noise levels (Nowak & Dwyer, 2007) and air pollutants (Escobedo, Kroeger, & Wagner, 2011; Nowak & Dwyer, 2007; Nowak, Hirabayashi, Bodine, & Greenfield, 2014). Furthermore, the presence of trees is related to respondents recognizing mental health benefits of IGS, which confirms findings of other studies (Gerstenberg & Hofmann, 2016). Additionally, species diversity is sometimes linked with a positive influence on the mental health of urban dwellers (Fuller, Irvine, Devine-Wright, Warren, & Gaston, 2007).",

A similar conclusion was reached by our study, where people did not use these spaces for recreation and did not attribute them with educational and inspirational values. Since in many cities only cultural benefits make the presence of greenery formally recognized in decision-making processes, and thus protected under local plans, we consider suggestions for bringing these these benefits to analyzed areas to be particularly valuable.",

            "text": "The most common suggestion from our respondents was to improve the orderliness of IGS, e.g. through better maintenance and tidying, to make them more inviting. This is in line with other studies showing a preference for manicured, neat and well-kept UGS (\u00d6z\u00fcnger & Kendle, 2006) and an increased use of IGS, such as brownfields, if those were at least minimally maintained (Farahani & Mailer, 2019; Hofmann, Westermann, Kowarik, & van der Meer, 2012; Mathey et al., 2015). This preference for managed greenery rather than a more natural, wilder appearance was also emphasized in previous studies (Hands & Brown, 2002; Hofmann et al., 2012; Jorgensen et al., 2007; Lafortezza, Corry, Sanesi, & Brown, 2008; Rink & Arndt, 2016). Another suggested change, almost as popular as improved orderliness, was to improve the functionality of IGS, for example by adding benches or delineation of walking paths; this is concordant with results obtained by Unt and Bell (2014), who showed that the number of users increased when a few pieces of equipment were set in an urban wilderness. The demand for green measures was less popular. The preference for new greenery was largely in line with the provision of manicured space, by indicating flowerbeds and neat lawns. A preference for such tidy formal features was also found in other studies (\u00d6z\u00fcnger & Kendle, 2006; Po\u0161kus & Po\u0161kien\u0117, 2015; Sikorski et al., 2018); additionally, it was shown that the presence of flowers clearly increases the attractiveness of UGS in many cases (e.g. Lee, Williams, Sargent, Farrell, & Williams, 2014; Lindemann-Matthies & Brieger, 2016; Todorova, Asakawa, & Aikoh, 2004). Passers-by also expressed a desire for more trees to be planted in IGS. Similarly, other studies have shown a fondness for urban trees among citizens (Camacho-Cervantes, Schondube, Castillo, & MacGregor-Fors, 2014; Fernandes, DaSilva, Teixeira, & Costa, 2019; Lafortezza et al., 2008; Todorova et al., 2004).",

As a result, they proposed solutions that would improve the safety of the site, which did not always include removing greenery and changing its wild appearance. Instead, they suggested for example, frequent inspections by city authorities or municipal police. The problem of perceived safety risks in IGS is widespread and recognized in literature (Jorgensen et al., 2007; \u00d6z\u00fcnger & Kendle, 2006; Rink & Arndt, 2016). The reasons given include dense, unmanaged vegetation, which translates into short viewing distances (Bixler & Floyd, 1997; Schroeder & Anderson, 1983), where vegetation interferes with surveillance (Jorgensen, Hitchmough, & Calvert, 2002). This can be conducive to antisocial behavior such as dumping rubbish, violence, harassment and drug/alcohol consumption (Rall & Haase, 2011; Rink & Arndt, 2016). Several studies suggest that even minor maintenance interventions such as trimming vegetation (Rall & Haase, 2011; Unt & Bell, 2014) can reduce the perception of danger (Lindemann-Matthies & Brieger, 2016; \u00d6z\u00fcnger & Kendle, 2006).",

Contact with nature is known to influence mental health through lowering depression (Sarkar, Webster, & Gallacher, 2018), anxiety (Gascon et al., 2018) and stress (Pun, Manjourides, & Suh, 2018; Tyrv\u00e4inen et al., 2014), improving concentration (Ottosson & Grahn, 2006), and reducing aggressive and violent behavior (Younan et al., 2016). There are also a number of indirect effects of green infrastructure on wellbeing, emerging from regulating ecosystem services. Greenery in cities can help to cool the environment through evapotranspiration and shade provision (Bowler et al., 2010; Djeki\u0107 et al., 2018; Kleerekoper, van Esch, & Salcedo, 2012), reduce noise nuisance (Dzhambov & Dimitrova, 2015; Li, Chau, & Tang, 2010; Van Renterghem & Botteldooren, 2016), and filter particulate matter from polluted air (Popek, Gawro\u0144ska, S\u00e6b\u00f8, Wrochna, & Gawro\u0144ski, 2013; Przybysz, Nersisyan, & Gawro\u0144ski, 2019). Almost 84.5% of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a residents have highly limited access to any formal UGS. This has a twofold effect: it places existing high-quality green areas at risk of invasion of housing estates, and increases the effects of eco-gentrification, making the most vulnerable communities more exposed to adverse effects of urbanization and climate change (Anguelovski, Connolly, Masip, & Pearsall, 2018; Koprowska, \u0141aszkiewicz, & Kronenberg, 2020; Pearsall & Eller, 2020; Rigolon & Nemeth, 2020; Wolch, Byrne, & Newell, 2014). In both cases, IGS can serve as important planning alternatives, especially in cities where they are as abundant and widespread as in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Sikorska et al., in press). Their integration into spatial planning systems as new temporary or permanent green spaces can be a viable solution, potentially welcome by residents, who \u2013 as shown by our research \u2013 are aware of the impact such places have on their quality of life. Since cultural ecosystem services are co-created by people and ecosystems (Andersson et al., 2015), this is likely to set IGS in the city fabric by activities that promote their widespread use. A similar pattern of results was obtained by Mathey et al. (2018): their research into urban brownfields with spontaneous vegetation shows that in the case of redevelopment, spontaneous vegetation should be linked with aesthetic motives as well as traditional concepts of land management in order to meet the residents\u2019 preferences for land use. This can lead to higher acceptance by local residents and help spatial planners to combine nature conservation and use of greenery (Mathey et al., 2018; Sukopp, 2005). Moreover, the changes requested by respondents in our research referred to relatively minor interventions that would not always completely change the nature of the site nor impose a burden on municipal services. Such balanced intervention can meet the requirements of both people and nature. Additionally, the suggestion to plant trees in places with scarce tall vegetation would improve biodiversity and regulatory services. Indeed, studies of the influence of revitalization of brownfields conducted by Koch, Bilke, Helbig, and Schlink (2018) show that redevelopment does not always lead to a reduction of i.e. cooling effects.",

            "text": "IGS can become areas which provide city residents access to greenery, improving their quality of life. Excluding them from development plans can be a critical element of environmental justice. Every aspect of intervention in urban areas takes into account their morphology as well as function and connectivity, and should be considered in a comprehensive way as a socio-ecological approach to transitions towards city sustainability (Krauze & Wagner, 2019; Kronenberg et al., 2017). In the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a example the majority of the respondents were in favour of preserving IGS after only minor interventions. Thus expectations were very modest and could be met at very low cost to the city. The claim raised as a response to the absence of alternative green areas in neighborhoods, and lack of other alternatives (private green spaces, opportunities to move out, or spend time outside the city). Consequently considering IGS in local plans would significantly improve living conditions of interviewed commuters, while simultaneously the interventions (cleaning, creating walking paths, benches) would have broader positive effect e.g. on vulnerable communities (elderly, children, poor). In the conditions of generally poor health status of citizens, exacerbated by effects of climate change, shrinking and aging population, and struggle with poverty and social exclusion, IGS seem to be the easiest, and the most economical way to create multiple benefits to society and nature-based insurance system. Lack of formal recognition of IGS creates a very fragile balance between green and grey infrastructure, questioning sustainability and adaptability of cities. During preparation of this paper two out of five studied areas have been already lost for housing development. It coincided with coronavirus outbreak followed by enclosure of all formal green areas (still located at half kilometers distance, and separated with barriers \u2013 busy streets and railways from study places). The situation became an eye opening event to residents of many city districts, whose daily activities got squeezed to tiny, overcrowded back and front yards. There is however no evidence of changes in the city spatial planning policy while many other European cities started to revise approach to IGS (Samuelsson, Barthel, Colding, Macassa, & Giusti, 2020).",
