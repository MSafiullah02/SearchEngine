Newborns depend on their hepatic glycogen reserves during the first 24 hours, with minimal glucose derivation from gluconeogenic branched chain amino acids. Although the ability to synthesize glycogen develops early, stores of hepatic glycogen accumulate only near term. Hepatic glycogen stores may be low at birth subsequent to intrauterine malnutrition (i.e., multiple pregnancies) or maternal malnutrition. Within 12 hours of birth, hepatic glycogenolysis consumes most glycogen stores, necessitating nutritional intake and gluconeogenesis to maintain euglycemia. It is during this interval that newborns are most susceptible to hypoglycemia. Generally initial blood glucose concentrations in newborn dogs are lower than in adults, although values exceeding 200 mg/dl have been documented. However, puppies deprived of food, especially toy breeds, may develop symptomatic hypoglycemia within 48 hours in contrast to adults, which can fast for days or weeks without becoming hypoglycemic. Comparatively, symptomatic hypoglycemia is uncommon in neonatal cats and may reflect their carnivore-based metabolism. Neonatal dogs have overall poor glycemic regulation compared with adults, with slow recovery from either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. This is attributed to a relative insensitivity to endogenous insulin and suboptimal counterregulatory hormone responses (cortisol and epinephrine) in puppies. Consequently puppies can develop prolonged hyperglycemia after supplemental glucose administration.",

            "text": "Serum bile acids (SBAs) are well documented as a reliable method for estimating sufficiency of hepatic function and hepatoportal circulation. Bile acids are synthesized in hepatocytes from cholesterol, conjugated to an amino acid (taurine exclusively in cats; taurine or glycine in dogs), excreted into bile, and then undergo an efficient enterohepatic circulation. In adults, the enterohepatic circulation has 90% to 95% efficiency (each cycle). The utility of the endogenous meal-provoked bile acid challenge for assessment of liver function and perfusion has been fully investigated in neonatal, juvenile, and adult dogs and cats. In our laboratory, SBA concentrations in 1-day-old and 1-, 2-, and 4-week-old puppies and kittens are within the adult reference range. In older puppies and kittens, paired SBA samples (one before and one 2 hours after meal ingestion) concur with the adult reference range. The SBA test is reliable for detection of portal circulatory anomalies when paired samples (premeal and 2 hours postprandially) are evaluated. Random or fasted single samples are ill advised. Normal values may exist in animals with portosystemic vascular anomalies after a prolonged fast owing to circulatory delivery of arterial blood. Approximately 15% to 20% of dogs and 5% to 10% of cats have higher postprandial SBA concentrations relative to premeal values owing to delayed gastric emptying, intestinal transit, or perhaps gallbladder expulsion of bile (physiologic variation). Paired-sample (one before and one 2 hours after meal ingestion) SBA tests are recommended for vigorous routine assessments. Screening puppies for portosystemic vascular anomalies (PSVAs) using single random or fasted SBA concentrations is not recommended. Some animals with PSVA have normal fasting SBA values, and a few demonstrate the \u201cbackward\u201d pattern described above. Physiologic variables influencing this test include (1) the gastric emptying rate, (2) the rate of gallbladder contraction and bile expulsion, (3) the rate of intestinal motility, (4) the functional status of the ileum where active bile acid transporters reside, and (5) the normalcy of the hepatobiliary structures and portal circulation.",

            "text": "Age-appropriate reference intervals for serum liver enzyme activity are essential for interpreting laboratory data in neonatal puppies and kittens. Differences in serum enzyme activities between neonates and adults reflect physiologic adaptations during the transition from fetal and neonatal life stages, trauma associated with birthing, colostrum ingestion, maturation of metabolic pathways, growth effects, differences in volume of distribution and body composition, and nutrition. Activity of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) usually increase greatly during the first 24 hours of life. In kittens, ALP, CK, and LDH activity exceeds adult values through 8 weeks of age, whereas AST increases only transiently after birth. The early increases in AST, CK, and LDH likely reflect muscle trauma associated with birthing, whereas ALP activity reflects bone isoenzyme associated with bone growth. Enteric absorption of colostral macromolecules during the first day of life causes a substantial increase in ALP in puppies and kittens, and of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in puppies (Figure 37-1, A and B\n). This phenomenon is not unique to dogs and cats as it has also been documented in neonatal calves, lambs, pigs, foals, and human infants. Studies also have confirmed significant differences in ALP activities develop between colostrum-deprived and suckling pups and kittens within 24 hours of birth, with a similar change in GGT also observed in puppies. These differences are short lived, resolving within the first 2 weeks, but can be used as a surrogate marker of effective colostrum ingestion. Studies have confirmed that colostrum contains substantially higher GGT and ALP activity than that resident in the serum of the respective dam or queen. For example, colostral or milk GGT in bitches is 100-fold and ALP is tenfold greater than sera until day 10. However, by day 30, GGT and ALP activity in milk is significantly lower than before suckling had commenced. Although a marked influence of colostrum on serum ALP activity in neonatal kittens also occurs, the effect on GGT is modest compared with that in neonatal puppies. Sustained increases (first 6 to 12 months of life) in serum ALP activity in puppies and kittens (maximally threefold more than high normal adult reference values) reflect the bone ALP isoenzyme derived from osteoblast activity.",

By 8 weeks of age, puppies have normal adult albumin concentrations, whereas total globulin values increase with age, reflecting cumulative antigenic challenge. Although coagulation assessments are uncommonly completed in neonatal puppies and kittens, limited observations suggest that values fall within the normal adult ranges for prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and fibrinogen in animals as young as 8 weeks of age. Protein C, recently shown to discriminate normal puppies from puppies with PSVA, is influenced by adequacy of portal venous perfusion.

Extensive studies including organic anion dye clearance, colorectal scintigraphy, hepatic and portal ultrasonography, contrast radiographic portography, and liver biopsy (multiple liver lobes in each dog) confirmed MVD is associated with abnormal microscopic hepatic blood flow and a lack of macroscopic portosystemic shunting. In dogs with PSVA, hepatic ultrasonography detected a subjectively small liver, abnormal portal to systemic vascular communications, and hypovascular intrahepatic portal perfusion. In dogs with MVD, intrahepatic portal vasculature was less well defined than in normal dogs; liver size was subjectively normal; and no large shunting vessels were identified. Radiographic portography confirmed macroscopic shunting only in dogs with PSVA but disclosed inconsistent portal venous perfusion among liver lobes in dogs with MVD. Dogs with only MVD demonstrated contrast retention in some liver lobes, consistent with differential perfusion among liver lobes, and a lack of well-distinguished tertiary portal branches. These findings correspond nicely with scintigraphic features described as portal streamlining in dogs scrutinized for PSVA that lacked a macroscopic shunt. Microscopic features in dogs with only MVD overlap with those observed in dogs with PSVA depending on the liver lobe sampled; lesions are inconsistent among different liver lobes. Cytologic imprints of liver biopsies in dogs with either MVD or PSVA usually demonstrate small binucleate hepatocytes.",

It is important to realize the differences between MVD and PSVA. Dogs with MVD usually remain asymptomatic and do not require special liver diets or therapeutic interventions with lactulose, metronidazole, neomycin, antioxidants, or ursodeoxycholic acid. The typical liver affected with MVD has no necroinflammatory component. High bile acids in these dogs represent the circulatory flux of the enterohepatic bile acid circulation rather than injurious bile acids retained in tissues. Dogs with MVD followed long term (up to 15 years) maintained on a canine maintenance diet without additional therapies do not develop progressive liver injury. Because many small Terrier-type dog breeds have a 30% to 35% incidence of MVD, puppies should be tested using a paired SBA test at 4 months of age before adoption into a pet home. Knowing a dog's SBA status is important for future health care and assessments.",

Most symptomatic dogs are \u201cunthrifty\u201d in appearance and often are the litter \u201crunt.\u201d If not stunted early, most fail to keep up with growth expectations. Neurobehavioral signs (hepatic encephalopathy [HE]) may manifest early during the first few weeks of life owing to hypoglycemia (especially in toy breeds). Signs of HE also may manifest as the puppy or kitten is weaned onto growth-formulated diets from milk or when older animals are cutting teeth and swallowing blood. Failure to demonstrate overt signs of HE in the neonatal period relates to the protein and carbohydrate composition of the milk diet. Signs of HE are episodic and typically associated with meals. However, enteric parasitism can also provoke neurologic signs as a result of enteric inflammation and bleeding. Blood within the intestinal canal is highly encephalogenic in patients prone to HE. Neurobehavioral signs may involve propulsive circling, amaurosis (unexplained transient blindness), dementia (head pressing, staring, vocalizing), aggression (especially in cats), seizure, lethargy, or coma. Gastrointestinal signs may include anorexia, vomiting, constipation (worsens HE), diarrhea, or ptyalism (excessive salivation, in cats especially, often confused with upper respiratory tract infection). Urinary tract signs may include abnormally increased water consumption and increased urine production (polydipsia/polyuria) as a result of the effect of neurologic toxins or dysfunctional hepatic osmostats. Dogs with PSVA often have a markedly increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) owing to their remarkable water flux. Ammonium biurate urolithiasis may cause stranguria or dysuria and hematuria. Rarely acute abdominal pain reflects ureteroliths. Fever (intermittent) may occur as a result of circulatory bypass of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system that normally provides immune surveillance against infectious material transported from the gut. Intolerance to certain drugs requiring hepatic biotransformation or first-pass elimination may be noted at the time of neutering (general anesthesia) or when anticonvulsant medications are needed to control seizure activity. Animals with PSVA become extraordinarily ill when challenged by infectious disorders (e.g., abscess, puncture wound, rickettsial infections).",

A computer-linked gamma-camera records portal distribution of isotope either to the heart (shunt) or liver (no shunt present) within 3 minutes. This noninvasive technique usually confirms PSVA macroscopic shunting. Unfortunately it is unable to describe anatomic shunt location, to verify multiple (acquired shunts) versus single congenital shunts, and may miss shunts in very petite patients, splenic vein to azygos vein shunts, and shunts occluded by visceral compression while the patient is in lateral recumbency. Radiographic contrast portovenography is the \u201cgold standard\u201d for PSVA confirmation (Figure 37-4\n). Various methods have been described, including (1) mesenteric vein cannulation (requires surgery), (2) splenic vein cannulation (surgery or ultrasound guided), (3) splenic pulp injection (percutaneous, ultrasound guided, or surgical; may cause infarcts/infection/hemorrhage), (4) arteriography via cannulation of the anterior mesenteric artery through the femoral artery (fluoroscopy directed, contrast dilution impairs strong shunt visualization), and (5) nonselective venography by rapid bolus jugular vein injection of contrast (useful only in very petite patients as contrast dilution is a problem). Mesenteric vein cannulation during exploratory laparotomy is most commonly used. Both right and left lateral recumbency portograms and a ventrodorsal portogram are used to verify that a PSVA has not been missed (Figure 37-5\n). Many extrahepatic PSVAs are better visualized on a single lateral projection; the side of best imaging is inconsistent. Left gastric vein shunts can resemble the shape of a ductus venosus on lateral radiographs, each having an S or Z shape. A helpful but imperfect general rule is that intrahepatic PSVA can be differentiated from extrahepatic PSVA by location relative to the thoracolumbar spine. Most intrahepatic PSVAs have their caudal extent cranial to T13, whereas most extrahepatic PSVAs have their caudal extent caudal to T13.",

            "text": "Medical management of PSVA is aimed at minimizing signs of HE and encompasses manipulation of dietary protein, modification of enteric flora, and avoidance of medications or substances augmenting or inducing encephalopathic signs. Careful regulation of dietary protein intake is critical. For dogs, a restricted protein diet (2.2 to 2.5 gm protein/kg body weight) derived chiefly from dairy and soy protein sources is best. Some dogs also tolerate chicken (white meat). Commercial diets formulated for dogs with hepatic insufficiency are convenient and function well in dogs with PSVA. Supplementation of such diets with additional cheese or cottage cheese to increase protein intake by 0.5 gm protein/kg body weight can be used to individually titrate protein intake to response. Diets can be modified with assistance from the free Nutritional Analysis Tools and System website (http://nat.crgq.com/mainnat.html). Meals should be frequent and small to maximize digestion and absorption. Minimizing colonic residue is helpful as colonic anaerobes degrade nitrogenous compounds to ammonia. Dogs with inoperable PSVA (severe MVD causing intrahepatic portal atresia or extrahepatic portal atresia) have been managed for more than 3 years in the author's home without incident using commercial diets formulated for hepatic insufficiency. It is certain that dietary modification alone may be sufficient to abate clinical signs in dogs with PSVA. However, dogs with persistent ammonium biurate crystalluria or neuroencephalopathic signs should adjunctively receive lactulose dosed to achieve multiple soft stools per day (0.25 to 1 ml per 4.5 kg orally daily) and/or metronidazole (7.5 mg/kg body weight orally twice daily) or amoxicillin (especially cats, 2.5 mg/kg orally twice daily). Neomycin is the least desirable treatment for enteric flora modification. A small percentage of oral neomycin is absorbed and may result in renal injury or hearing loss with long-term administration. Milk can be used as an alternative for lactulose in some dogs and cats (lactose intolerance). Lactulose, a synthetic disaccharide indigestible by mammals, is fermented in the enteric canal to organic acids that acidify luminal contents. Colonic acidification promotes ammonium ion trapping, which reduces ammonia uptake into the portal circulation. Colonic acidification also inhibits enteric urease and protease activities. Organic acids promote bacterial nitrogen fixation and impose an osmotic catharsis (frequent soft stools) that promotes colonic evaluation of toxic substrates and products. If a commercial diet formulated for dogs or cats with hepatic insufficiency is used, additional vitamin supplements are not urgent. If a homemade diet is used, additional vitamins are recommended, taking care to avoid methionine supplements. Most dogs with PSVA have subnormal liver zinc concentrations, suggesting systemic zinc insufficiency. Zinc supplementation (1 to 2.5 mg elemental zinc/kg body weight/day) is recommended because zinc is essential for certain metalloenzymes (e.g., urea cycle). Zinc acetate is most commonly used (31% elemental zinc of formula weight) and can be compounded from Galzin (Gate Pharmaceuticals, North Wales, PA).",

Attention also must be given to avoid conditions that can promote HE; these promiscuously expose patients to endogenous systemic or enteric toxins, nitrogen challenge, or promote dehydration and azotemia. Constipation must be avoided as colonic contents are an important toxin source contributing to HE. Management of acute severe HE requires mechanical cleansing of the colon with warm polyionic fluids until fecal debris is clear. Thereafter, instillation of a retention enema is used to modify enteric pH, flora, urease, and protease activities. Lactulose is the preferred retention enema solution.

            "text": "Copper, an essential component of certain metalloenzymes, is absorbed from food, circulates bound to plasma proteins, and is taken up into the liver. A complex hepatocellular copper transport system (chaperones, binding proteins, membrane transporters) disperses copper to essential storage sites and excretes excess copper into canalicular bile. In health, these mechanisms ensure a neutral copper balance with reasonable copper ingestion. Excess hepatic copper retention is easily identified in liver biopsies with copper-specific stains (e.g., rhodanine, rubeanic acid). However, hepatocellular copper excess must be verified by reconciliation of copper-specific stains and quantitative tissue copper measurements (expressed on a dry weight basis). Excessive hepatocellular copper leads to organelle and cell membrane oxidative injury and lysosomal degranulation causing cell necrosis, and a progressive hepatopathy. Initial injury occurs in zone 3 (centrilobular, periacinar). Dogs homozygous for the mutation develop a progressive hepatopathy that may become evident during the first year of life (high serum ALT activity). However, most affected dogs develop a progressive diffuse hepatopathy evident after several years of life. Homozygous normal and heterozygous carrier dogs usually have hepatic copper concentrations in the normal range (\u2264400 \u00b5g/g dry weight liver), whereas homozygous affected dogs develop increased hepatic copper concentrations during the first year. Hepatic copper concentrations greater than 2000 \u00b5g/g dry tissue are consistently associated with morphologic and functional evidence of a progressive hepatopathy that may proceed to cirrhosis without treatment. Older affected animals may develop hepatic copper concentrations greater than 10,000 \u00b5g/g dry tissue. Many affected dogs can be identified as early as 6 months of age based on hepatic biopsy (copper granule accumulation) and metal quantification before histologic evidence of hepatocellular injury. Some dogs require as long as 1 year before accumulating excessive hepatic copper. Although affected Bedlington Terriers may have evidence of increased hepatic copper as early as 8 to 12 weeks of age, biopsy at this age is unreliable for discriminating affectation status.",

A recommended dosage of d-penicillamine is 10 to 15 mg/kg body weight given orally every 12 hours 30 minutes before feeding. The most common adverse effects are vomiting and anorexia mitigated by initial dose reduction and gradual retitration and dose administration with food. If d-penicillamine is not tolerated, 2,2,2 tetramine may be used as an alternative chelator; 5 to 7 mg/kg is given orally every 12 hours 30 minutes before feeding. Vitamin C is contraindicated in liver disease associated with transition metal accumulation (copper, iron) because it may enhance oxidative injury. Pyridoxine supplementation (5 to 25 mg/day) is recommended with long-term d-penicillamine therapy. Vitamin E (10 IU/kg body weight/day) and S-adenosylmethionine (20 mg/kg body weight/day given orally on an empty stomach) are recommended antioxidants for dogs with excess hepatic copper storage. Prednisolone administration is not advised unless a dog is suffering a necrolytic or hemolytic copper crisis or an immune-mediated inflammatory process coexists. Dietary copper intake should be restricted to less than 5.0 ppm (dry matter basis) or no greater than 0.4 mg copper/day for a Bedlington Terrier. The amount of copper in commercial dog foods is variable, and the manufacturer should be contacted for specific information. Copper in the drinking water should not exceed 0.2 ppm (0.2 \u00b5g/L), especially if chelation therapy is the mainstay of therapy. It is prudent to avoid domestically softened water passing through copper pipes as this may contribute copper during initial flushing each day. Vitamin supplements should be investigated to determine their copper content before daily use. Nutritional support using home-cooked copper-restricted diets (e.g., avoiding organ meats, nuts, shrimp, and legumes) and commercial diets manufactured for dogs with liver disease have been successfully used in affected Bedlington Terriers.

Dietary modification involves selection of foodstuffs low in purines rather than focusing on protein restriction. Foods low in purines include bread and cereal (except whole grains), most vegetables excluding cauliflower, spinach, peas, mushrooms, and legumes (kidney beans, navy beans, lima beans, and lentils), fruit (avoid acidic citrus), nuts, pasta, eggs, cheese, milk, and butter. Foods with moderate purine content or risk include most poultry (chicken, turkey), fish and shellfish (except mussels and scallops), lamb, pork, and beef, oats and oatmeal, wheat germ and bran, and whole grain breads. Foods with high purine or risk include those noted above and organ meats (kidneys, liver, brains, hearts), game meats (venison, duck, goose), high purine seafoods such as sardines and mackerel, yeast (including brewer's yeast), and gravies made from organ meats. There are few prescription manufactured diets restrictive enough in purines to be appropriate for stone dissolution (Hills U/D); however, this diet is not an appropriate growth food for puppies. Thus affected puppies should have surgical removal of their stones as medical stone dissolution can take months (3 to 4 months is common). Allopurinol is used to inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme transforming hypoxanthine to uric acid. Initial starting dose is 15 mg/kg body weight given orally every 12 hours. It is important to titrate the dose of allopurinol against the urinary uric acid concentration because inhibition of xanthine oxidase causes high urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine. Unfortunately excess urine xanthine concentrations can lead to xanthine urolithiasis. A 24-hour uric acid production test is used to titrate allopurinol dosing. All urine produced over a 12-hour interval is collected, mixed well, and an aliquot is submitted for measurement of uric acid. Optimal uric acid elimination approximates 300 mg/kg body weight/day. If output is much lower, the allopurinol dose is reduced; if output is much higher, the allopurinol dose is increased. However, scrutiny of dietary intake also is essential before recommending dose adjustments.",

Because most animals were evaluated for primary conditions in other organ systems or for infectious disorders, it is likely that hepatic lipidosis in this population represents a sequela of acquired nutritional inadequacies. A variety of metabolic disorders can disturb mobilization of triglycerides from the liver or enhance mobilization of peripheral fat stores to the liver. Whenever intrahepatic lipid synthesis or hepatocellular uptake of fat exceeds hepatic triglyceride dispersal, hepatic lipidosis ensues. It is well documented that the metabolic balance in juveniles is fragile. Studies have confirmed excess hepatic triglyceride accumulation in puppies born to undernourished bitches and in semistarved puppies fed only glucose at a rate of 60 kcal/kg body weight/day for 10 days. Two-month-old puppies completely starved for 24 hours also develop significantly greater hepatic triglyceride stores than normally fed control puppies. It is well established that cats have higher susceptibility to diffuse hepatic lipidosis compared with dogs. Any serious medical condition in the cat that induces anorexia can lead to diffuse severe hepatic lipid accumulation. Cytoplasmic hepatocellular vacuolation with triglycerides adversely influences hepatic function, leading to metabolic failure in affected cats. Nutritional support ensuring adequate intake of energy and protein, as well as providing essential amino acids, fatty acids, and water-soluble vitamins, is the major focus of treatment. Forced enteral feeding by gentle syringe alimentation, nasogastric intubation, or esophagostomy tube (especially cats) is necessary in most patients. Supplementation of cobalamin in B12-deficient cats is essential. Oral supplementation with L-carnitine (250 mg/day, medical grade), taurine (250 to 500 mg/day), thiamine (50 to 100 mg/day), S-adenosylmethionine (190 mg/day on an empty stomach), and vitamin E (10 U/kg body weight/day) is recommended.",

Other species of flukes that may infect cats include Amphimerus pseudofelineus, Opisthorchis tenuicollis, Metorchis albidus, and Metorchis conjunctus. The life cycle of P. concinnum requires a tropical to semitropical climate and two intermediate hosts: a land snail (Subulina octona) and a lizard or marine toad. Cats acquire infection by ingestion of the second intermediate host. Once ingested, the parasite migrates up the common bile duct into the gallbladder, bile ducts, and pancreas. In 8 to 12 weeks, adult flukes produce embryonated eggs that are passed in feces. Recognition of fluke eggs in feces (fecal sedimentation) is the basis of definitive diagnosis. Clinical signs of liver injury are apparent by 7 to 16 weeks after infection and may include lethargy, inappetence, weight loss, emaciation, hepatomegaly, mucoid diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness. The severity of clinical signs varies with the degree of the fluke infection; many naturally infected cats show no clinical signs. In experimentally infected cats, 62% returned to normal clinical health in 24 weeks without treatment. In heavily infected cats, clinical signs may develop before fecal shedding of ova. Circulating eosinophilia may develop and peak at 4 to 5 months after infection. Transient increases in serum AST and ALT activity develop during fluke migration through the liver. Serum ALP and GGT activities may remain normal or may increase depending on the numbers of developing flukes and the extent of invasion and obstruction of biliary structures. Cats with heavy fluke infection may become jaundiced, albeit some only transiently, as a result of biliary tree obstruction. Flukes within the gallbladder can be visualized ultrasonographically as hypoechoic foci. Histologic lesions in hepatic parenchyma and biliary structures include leukocyte infiltration, adenomatous hyperplasia of biliary structures, and periportal and periductal fibrosis. Chronic fluke infestation and bile duct obstruction may result in biliary cirrhosis. On postmortem examination, gross lesions may be absent; when apparent, enlargement of the gallbladder and bile ducts is found. Adult flukes and eggs are demonstrable in bile and within biliary structures. Treatment with praziquantel (20 to 40 mg/kg daily for 3 days) eradicates fluke infestation.",

            "text": "Infection with feline coronavirus causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP; herein referred to as FIPV) most often affects kittens and cats between 6 months and 5 years of age housed in a multiple-cat population. FIPV reflects a progressive and lethal coronavirus infection causing immune-mediated tissue injury. Tissue lesions are initiated by virus or viral antigen and host antiviral antibodies and complement. Humoral antibody responses increase virus pathogenicity, and cell-mediated immune responses play a decisive protective role. Effusive FIPV is thought to represent acute disease, occurring 4 to 8 weeks after infection or a stress-imposing event. The less common dry form of FIPV is considered to reflect a chronic form of infection. In dry FIPV, a 2- to 12-week interval of vague illness precedes initial presentation. Clinical signs include chronic undulant fever, inappetence, and weight loss. Plasma protein concentrations increase as a result of variable increases in globulins associated with an acute phase response. Coagulopathy reflects diffuse vascular injury and occurs in cats with severe inflammatory lesions or diffuse severe hepatic involvement. Coagulopathies and thrombocytopenia are more common in cats with effusive FIPV, and their presence portends a grave prognosis. Clinical signs of either syndrome ultimately depend on involved target organs. The clinical syndromes associated with FIPV are described in Chapter 16 on Viral Infections. Necrotizing hepatitis reflects immune complex\u2013facilitated tissue injury, and lesions are associated with inflammatory perivascular cuffing. Animals with FIPV hepatitis may demonstrate anterior abdominal pain and hepatomegaly, with a subset becoming jaundiced. Serum ALT and AST activities are variably increased, ranging from twofold to tenfold normal values.",

However, dogs with partial PAA showing chronic intermittent gastrointestinal signs should receive a clinical trial of supplemental enzyme therapy. Patients with clinical PAA showing persistent signs despite enzyme replacement require a full diagnostic evaluation for inflammatory bowel disease or treatment for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). It is well acknowledged that EPI may be associated with secondary problems including SIBO, low cobalamin concentrations, and coexistent inflammatory bowel disease. Genesis of SIBO is attributed to loss of bacteriostatic factors normally supplied by pancreatic secretions and to greater availability of undigested enteric substrates that allow development of SIBO. Some evidence suggests that pancreatic enzyme replacement alone or administration of tylosin can abate SIBO. In SIBO, low cobalamin concentrations are proposed to reflect bacterial vitamin sequestration or failure to degrade nonintrinsic factor proteins (R proteins) that bind luminal cobalamin. Low cobalamin concentrations also may reflect deficient production of pancreatic intrinsic factor as a result of acinar atrophy. In one study of dogs with EPI, cobalamin concentrations were low in 82%; a smaller subset had severe hypocobalaminemia (<100 ng/L), which seemingly functioned as a negative prognostic indicator (i.e., shortened survival). Parenteral cobalamin administration is necessary in dogs with subnormal cobalamin concentrations; such treatment is inexpensive and safe, and a good response can be expected in 60% of treated dogs (one study). High folate concentrations, consistent with enteric microbial folate synthesis, have been documented in 37% of dogs with EPI (one study). Although SIBO has been anecdotally linked with EPI, this syndrome remains controversial, and neither high serum folate nor low serum cobalamin concentrations can accurately confirm its presence.
