            "text": "In 1955, Christian de Duve discovered a distinct class of a single population of homogeneous granules containing five acidic hydrolases. It was proposed to refer to these granules as lysosomes, because of their richness in terms of hydrolytic enzymes [1]. The finding that these hydrolases act on different substrates suggested that the lysosomes, also known as \u201csuicide bags\u201d, might play a role in intracellular digestion at acidic pH. Lysosomes were then discovered in several cell types and found to be involved in the degradation of extracellular material taken up by endocytosis and intracellular material taken up by autophagy. Thus, in a short time, the lysosome concept was quickly accepted [2], [3], [4], [5]. In parallel, based on these findings, numerous lysosomal hydrolases were isolated, characterized, and their mechanisms of action were established. With the discovery of the ubiquitin-proteasome system [6] it was concluded that there are two major systems for intracellular protein degradation: the lysosomal system and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is well established that the endosomal/lysosomal system has numerous functions in normal and pathological processes, including the survival function [7].",

            "text": "In the lysosomal system, protein degradation is a result of the combined random and limited action of various proteases (also termed peptidases or proteolytic enzymes). In order to achieve the efficient degradation of biological macromolecules within the lysosomes, lysosomes contain a number of diverse hydrolases, including proteases, amylases, lipases and nucleases. Among the approximately 50 known lysosomal hydrolases, of particular importance are the aspartic, serine and cysteine proteases [8]. In addition to the aspartic cathepsin D, cysteine cathepsins have a key role among the lysosomal proteases. They belong to the clan CA of cysteine peptidases, which are widely distributed among living organisms, and represent one of the most investigated groups of enzymes. More specifically, they are members of the C1 family of papain-like enzymes, the largest and the best characterized family of cysteine peptidases, which include, among others, papain and related plant enzymes, proteases in parasites and helminths, insect-homologs of papain, trematode cysteine proteases, viral proteases, and lysosomal cysteine cathepsins [9]. This chapter will focus on human cysteine cathepsins, which have been the subject of numerous reviews in the past [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].",

            "text": "The majority of cathepsins are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues such as cathepsins B, H, L, C, X, F, O and V. Their expression profile indicates that these enzymes are involved in a normal cellular protein degradation and turnover. In contrast, cathepsins K, W and S show a restricted cell or tissue-specific distribution, indicating their more specific roles. For example, cathepsin K is highly expressed in osteoclasts, in most epithelial cells and in the synovial fibroblasts in rheumatoid arthritis joints [22]. Among the matrix-degrading enzymes, cathepsin K is the only enzyme for which an essential role in bone resorption has been unambiguously documented in mice and humans [23]. Cathepsin W (also lymphopain) is predominantly expressed in CD8+ lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells [24], [25]. However, when cathepsin W expression has been downregulated using the shRNA approach, its essential role in the process of cytotoxity has been excluded [26]. Cathepsin S is predominantly expressed in the professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as the dendritic cells (DCs) and B-cells [27]. In addition, cathepsin V (also named L2) is highly homologous to cathepsin L, but in contrast to the ubiquitously expressed cathepsin L, its expression is restricted to thymus and testis [28], [29]. However, recent studies have shown that active cathepsins are also localized in other cellular compartments, such as the nucleus, cytoplasm and plasma membrane. It was thus shown that the catalytically active cathepsin L variants localized to the nucleus play a role in the regulation of cell-cycle progression [30] and the proteolytic processing of the N-terminus of the histone H3 tail [31], [32]. In addition, it was shown to interact with the histones H2A.Z, H2B, H3 and the protease inhibitor stefin B [33]. These studies and the nuclear localization of cathepsin F [34] and possibly other cathepsins, provide the first evidence that histones may be very important substrates of cathepsins, thus opening up a new role for these enzymes.",

When cathepsins are outside the lysosomes or extracellularly they can be relatively rapidly irreversibly inactivated at neutral pH [40]. An exception is cathepsin S, which is stable at a neutral or slightly alkaline pH, thus retaining most of its activity [41]. The inactivation of cathepsin L, the most unstable of the cathepsins at neutral pH, was found to be a first-order process and the rate of the process decreased with the substrate concentration that conferred some protection [42]. In cathepsin B, an irreversible loss of activity accompanied by structural changes was observed. The enzyme was destabilized by increasing the ionic strength and the content of organic solvent [43]. However, after the binding of heparin to cathepsin B through an interaction with its occluding loop, the enzyme was partially protected from alkaline-pH-induced inactivation as a consequence of the restriction of the enzyme flexibility, which makes stronger contacts within the molecule [44], [45]. In addition, it was recently suggested that catalase may participate in the protection of extracellular cysteine cathepsins against peroxidation [46].",

            "text": "The extracellular localization of cysteine cathepsins often coincides with their increased expression and/or activity, indicating that pH is not the sole factor responsible for their activity. Twenty years ago, it was demonstrated that cathepsin B, from normal or tumor tissues degraded purified extracellular-matrix components, type IV collagen, laminin and fibronectin, under both acid and neutral pH [47]. Cathepsins with strong elastolytic and collagenolytic activities are now known to be chiefly responsible for the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), thus contributing to various pathologies. The ECM consists of elastins, collagens and proteoglycans, which have all been identified as the cathepsin's substrates [48]. Elastin was found to be cleaved by the cathepsins K, L, S, F, V and B, although they differ in their elastolytic activitiy. Cathepsin V was thus found to be the most potent enzyme, followed by the cathepsins K, S, F, L and B [49], [50]. It was further demonstrated that the elastolytic activities of the cathepsins V and K could be inhibited by ubiquitously expressed glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as chondroitin sulfate, through the formation of cathepsin-GAG complexes. In contrast, cathepsin S, which does not form complexes with chondroitin sulfate, is not inhibited, thus suggesting that there might exist some specific regulation of the elastolytic activities of cathepsins by GAGs.",

Cathepsin K forms collagenolytically highly active complexes with GAGs, with different GAGs competing for the binding to the enzyme [53]. Some of them, such as chondroitin and keratan sulfate, enhance the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K, whereas heparan sulfate or heparin selectively inhibits this activity. Moreover, GAGs potentially inhibit the collagenase activity of cathepsins L and S [53]. In addition, the specific inhibition of the collagenase activity of cathepsin K by negatively charged polymers, such as polyglutamates and oligonucleotides, without affecting the overall proteolytic activity of the protease was observed [54]. It was suggested that during the interaction between cathepsin K and polymers, collagen degradation can be specifically inhibited, while its non-collagenolytic activities remain unchanged.",

            "text": "Although there is major evidence that various proteins can be degraded in vitro by cathepsins in acidic pH, there are scarce data about their intracellular physiological substrates. One of the main reasons for this is the cathepsin's instability and the loss of activity due to irreversible unfolding [40], [55]. The first, well-established, intracellular substrate of cathepsins was the proapoptotic Bcl-2 homolog protein Bid, which was initially found to be processed by the lysosomal extract, thereby triggering cytochrome c release from mitochondria and apoptosis [56]. There is significant redundancy among the cathepsins in cleaving Bid, as in in vitro experiments, and in a cell-free system Bid was found to be efficiently processed by the cathepsins B, K, L and H to a proapoptotic form [57]. This finding was confirmed in various cellular models [57], [58]. Moreover, it was found that, in addition to Bid, cathepsins simultaneously degrade the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and XIAP, thereby triggering apoptosis in a synergistic manner [58]. However, there are numerous biological processes in which cathepsins play an important role, but their substrates have not been identified so far. This part of the review will not focus on the well-known basic properties of cysteine cathepsins, which are presented elsewhere [9].",

The substrate binds along the active-site cleft in an extended conformation [11], [75]. Its side chains make alternating contacts with the L- and R-domains. The two loops on the L-domain and their bridged interface provide the surface for the side chains of the P3, P1 and P2\u2032 residues, whereas the loops and residues of the R-domain provide the binding surface for the P2 and P1\u2032 residues. An exception to this is the P2 residue. According to our model [75], the P2 residue interacts with both domains. Its main-chain atoms form an antiparallel hydrogen-bonding ladder with Gly68, while the side-chain atoms bind into the S2 pocket formed at the two-domain interface. The alternate positioning of the side chains suggests that there may be a cooperativity effect between the residues oriented toward the surface, in particular the P1 and P2\u2032 appear to be close enough to be able to interact.

Cathepsin C is an aminodipeptidase [70] and cathepsin H is, in addition to an endopeptidase, an aminopeptidase [67]. Cathepsin B is an endopeptidase and a carboxydipeptidase [63], whereas cathepsin X is a carboxymonopeptidase [68]. The crystal structures revealed that exopeptidases contain additional structural features that modify the active-site cleft [63], [67], [70] (Fig. 4\n). Whereas in endopeptidases (cathepsins F, L, K, S and V) the active-site cleft extends along the whole length of the two-domain interface, in exopeptidases (cathepsins B, C, H and X) additional features reduce the number of binding sites [75]. In the case of carboxypeptidases, substrate binding is governed by the loops that fill the active-site cleft on the primed sides. These loops in both carboxypeptidases, the occluding loop of cathepsin B and the mini-loop of cathepsin X, utilize histidine residue(s) to dock the C-terminal carboxylic group of the peptidyl substrate. In contrast, cathepsins H and C utilize regions from their propeptide parts in order to provide features that fill the active-site cleft on the non-primed sides. They use carboxylic groups of the main- and side-chain residues to dock the positively charged N-terminus of the peptidyl substrates. In cathepsin H the carboxylic group is located at the C-terminus of an eight-residues-long peptide [67], part of the propeptide, termed the mini-chain, which remains attached to the body of the enzyme after its activation. However, in cathepsin C, the carboxylic group comes from the D1 side chain positioned at the N-terminus of a whole additional domain, called the exclusion domain, which fills the active-site cleft [70]. Interestingly, in both aminopeptidases, glycosylation appears crucial for stabilizing the structure of these additional features and simultaneously fills the active-site cleft to tighten the substrate binding.",

The superposition of the structures provided support for only three well-defined substrate binding sites, S2, S1 and S1\u2032, where the substrate residues interact with the enzyme by the main- and side-chain interactions (Fig. 1). Among these only the S2 site forms a pocket. In the positions outside this region, there are only side-chain interactions. The spread of residue positions across the active-site cleft on the non-primed side demonstrates that the S3 and S4 binding sites are not really sites. More appropriately, they are described as areas in which the substrate residues individually find their most favorable binding position [11], [75]. On the primed binding side, there is still a limited structural insight into the substrate binding. Data are provided by the synthetic epoxysuccinyl-based inhibitors CA030, CA074 and NS134 complexes with cathepsin B [76], [77], [78]. Their binding revealed the position of the P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 residues. However, the information therein is also limited. On one hand it is redundant as the P1\u2032-like and P2\u2032-like residues are essentially the same in all structures. On the other hand, their information is biased. The P2\u2032-like residue docks its C-terminal carboxylic group against the side chains of the His110 and His111 positioned within the occluding loop of the cathepsin B. Since the occluding loop is specific for cathepsin B, in other cathepsins the positioning of the P2\u2032 residue may be different.",

The majority of studies performed in the 1990s were mostly focused on cathepsin B, which was the first cathepsin for which the crystal structure was determined [63]. The structure of the enzyme [63] revealed that part of the S2 pocket is formed by Glu245, a unique residue found only in cathepsin B but not in other cathepsins. Its mutation to glutamine showed the importance of processing the substrate with an arginine in the P2 position, but had no effect on the phenylalanine substrates [80]. Another example is a mutation at the S1 site of cathepsin B, which made the site more favorable for glycine, corresponding to the glycine-favorable papaya protease IV (glycyl endopeptidase) [81]. Although not entirely linked with the subsite specificity, the mutations of the histidine residues in the occluding loop, as well as the deletion of the loop, revealed the importance of the loop and the two histidine residues for the endopeptidase activity of cathepsin B [82], [83]. A similar attempt was made to understand the differences between the S2 sites of the cathepsins L and K [84]. Double mutations of the S2 pocket of cathepsins K (Y67L/L205A) and L (L67Y/A205L) induce a switch of their enzyme specificity towards small selective inhibitors and peptidyl substrates, confirming the crucial role of residues at positions 67 and 205. However, both mutants, the cathepsin-K-like cathepsin L as well as the cathepsin-L-like cathepsin K, were not capable of degrading collagen. This indicated that introducing the proline tolerance alone did not convert the cathepsin L to a collagenase, while abolishing the proline selectivity in cathepsin K prevented it from degrading the collagen. A similar follow-up study addressed the cathepsin K chondroitin binding site [85]. These example studies demonstrated that we have a basic understanding of how specificity is encoded in the structure. However, this understanding is still not sufficient to enable us to predict the selectivity for substrates based on the sequence and atomic structure of the cysteine cathepsins.",

Among the mammalian cysteine cathepsins, cathepsin K was found to have a unique preference for a proline residue in the P2 position, the primary determinant of its substrate specificity [91]. As a result of such screening, the highly selective Abz-HPGGPQ-EDDnp substrate was identified. The selectivity of the substrate primarily depends on the S2 and S2\u2032 site specificities and the ionization state of the histidine in the P3 position. Its hydrolysis was completely abolished in the cathepsin-K-deficient cell lysates, indicating its usefulness for monitoring cathepsin K activity in physiological fluids and cell lysates. Another screen of the S3\u2013S3\u2032 site specificity using Abz-KLRFSKQ-EDDnp as the template showed that the requirements of the S3\u2013S1 sites are more restricted than those of the S1\u2032\u2013S3\u2032 sites [92]. In addition, it was found that positively charged residues are favored in the P1 position, with glycine being almost equally well accepted. At the S3 site, positively charged residues were readily accepted, whereas the other sites had less pronounced preferences. However, when a proline was used in the P2 position it conferred specificity for cathepsin K [92].",

When screening cathepsin S using a template based on the Ii sequence, clear preferences for groups of amino acid residues were observed in the positions P3, P1 and P1\u2032 [93]. Based on these results, highly cathepsin-S-selective peptides were developed. On this basis, the authors suggested that the observed cleavage sites in Ii might be of relevance for its in vivo processing [93]. In a follow-up study, it was shown that the specificity of cathepsin S was mainly determined by the S2, S1\u2032, and S3\u2032 sites. At the P2 position the hydrophobic valine, methionine and norleucine residues were clearly preferred. Similarly, hydrophobic branched side chains were preferred at the P1\u2032 position. The resulting GRWHTVGLRWE-Lys(Dnp)-DArg-NH2 substrate with the cleavage site between Gly7 and Leu8 was claimed to be selective for cathepsin S more so than for cathepsins B, H, L and X [94]. The same authors have also confirmed that the substrate processing in endosomal fractions of antigen-presenting cells was abolished in the presence of LHVS (morpholinurea-leucine-homophenylalanin-vinyl sulfone-phenyl), a selective inhibitor of cathepsin S. In a similar attempt to distinguish cathepsin S from other cathepsins, a substrate was derived on the basis of its putative physiological substrates, i.e., the insulin \u03b2-chain and the class-II-associated invariant chain (CLIP) [95]. The resulting Abz-LEQ-EDDnp (Abz = ortho-aminobenzoic acid; EDDnp = N-[[2,4-dinitrophenyl]ethylenediamine]) peptide was capable of differentiating cathepsin S from the cathepsins L, B, V and K.",

Unrestrained by the length of the peptide, the screen revealed cathepsin K's preference for the aspartate at the P5\u2032 position. This specificity is believed to be relevant for the recognition of collagen substrates. Yet another way to determine the substrate specificity of cysteine cathepsins is to use a peptide phage library. Very recently, it has been reported that a cathepsin-L-like enzyme from the tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus has a preference for leucine or arginine at the P1 position [98].

It selectively alkylates the reactive site cysteine and remains covalently bound to the enzyme. Because it reacts almost exclusively with the reactive site cysteine of papain-like proteases, it has immediately become a widely used indicator of the proteolytic activity of cysteine cathepsins. Together with its derivatives that have improved cell-permeability properties, it was of immense importance for progress in understanding the function and properties of cysteine cathepsins, ranging from a titration of their activity to an assessment of their activity in cell lysates, cultures and living organisms. E-64 is a non-selective inhibitor of all the cysteine cathepsins, with the exception of cathepsin C, which is only weakly inhibited. In addition, E-64 also efficiently inhibits calpain [100]. The exploitation of its scaffold led to the seminal contribution of Katunuma's group, who developed the first specific inhibitors of cathepsin B, CA030, CA074 and their analogs [101], [102]. The crystal structure of cathepsin B with CA030 (ethyl-ester of epoxysuccinyl-L-Ile-L-Pro-OH), a CA074 analog [76] and later with CA074 in a complex with bovine cathepsin B [77], have shown that these inhibitors bind into the primed side (sites S1\u2032 and S2\u2032) of the active-site cleft in the direction of the substrate. These structures have confirmed that the carboxylic group of proline is indeed responsible for binding to the occluding loop histidines, His110 and His111, which were held responsible for the binding of the C-terminal carboxylic group of the peptidyl substrate. The alignment of the E-64 and CA030 binding geometries indicated that the epoxysuccinyl group possesses an internal symmetry with two C-terminal carboxylic groups to which both amino acid residues can be attached. The idea of using epoxysuccinyl as a building block that allows simultaneous access to the non-primed as well as the primed side of the active-site cleft was successfully adopted in the development of inhibitors of cathepsin B [103], [104] as well as the inhibitors of cathepsins K, L and S [105], [106]. The predicted binding geometry of the double-headed inhibitors has been confirmed by the crystal structures of papain-CLIK complexes as the model for cathepsin L [107] and the cathepsin B-NS-134 complex [78]. There are several, more detailed, papers on this subject worthy of further reading [75], [108], [109].",

Leupeptin, which is found in bacteria, was another inhibitor known from the 1970s [110]. It is an aldehyde that covalently binds to nucleophilic serine and cysteine residues at the active site of the cysteine and serine proteases. Due to its protease-class non-specific interactions it was less widely used than E-64. However, its reaction with the active site of cysteine proteases is reversible and allows a reactivation of the enzyme, while the attached residues can provide selectivity [111], [112]. There are a number of reactive groups, also called \u201cwarheads\u201d, which interact with more than one class of protease. For example, one of the pioneers of the synthesis of protease inhibitors, Elliott Shaw, exploited diazomethane as the reactive group [113], [114], [115].",

However, for the aminopeptidases cathepsins C and H this concept would be difficult to apply due to their two C-termini. To achieve selectivity for cathepsin-C dipeptidyl constructs with acyloxymethyl ketones, fluoromethyl ketones and vinyl sulfones were therefore developed [117]. On the other hand, the selectivity for cathepsin H would be confined to a single binding subsite, S1. Inhibitors with limited selectivity were also synthesized using chloro- and fluoro-methyl ketones as the reactive groups attached to a single amino acid residue [114].",

More information can be found in an excellent overview [125]. There are also constructs that extend across the active-site cleft without a covalent interaction and are not degraded, e.g., the cyclic ketones [126]. Lately, nitriles have been shown to give the best results and they have also been used in all clinical candidates [127]. The versatility of the small-molecule compounds is not confined like that of the peptidyl substrates and it does not directly address the subsite specificity in terms of the biological function and the role of cysteine cathepsins; therefore, this review does not attempt to provide any in-depth look at their selectivity. It should be mentioned that a number of inhibitors have been crystallized in complexes with cysteine cathepsins and their structures have been determined. At present there are 160 deposited structures corresponding to cathepsins, mainly they are cysteine proteases in complexes with small-molecule inhibitors. The drug-discovery processes, predominantly targeting cathepsins K, L and S, are underway. A few of these developments have already entered clinical trials [37].",

However, a novel approach termed \u201creverse design\u201d, built on the existing selective inhibitors of cysteine cathepsins and their subsequent conversion into substrates as the activity probes of proteases in vivo, was established [131]. The conversion of the inhibitors of cathepsins K and S by the replacement of the active-site-directed functional electrophylic group with a peptidyl unit and with the addition of a fluorophore and a quencher resulted in cell-permeable ABPs, which revealed the endolysosomal localization of cathepsins L and S. In these studies cathepsins B, L, K and S were used to evaluate the selectivity of the probes. Due to the non-suicidal nature of the activity probe, the physiology of the cells under investigation is potentially less disturbed. Moreover, such activity-based probes can be used for the validation of the effectiveness of activity-modulating compounds such as drug candidates in cells and in in vivo systems in a time-dependent manner [132].",

Nowadays, we try to understand how proteases hydrolyze their physiological substrates. The recent knowledge about the biological targets of cysteine cathepsins has largely come from identifying the origin of genetic disorders and, consequently, gene-knockout studies. There is a significant redundancy of cysteine cathepsins due to their co-localization and broad specificity. Although most of the cysteine cathepsins do not have a specific role, they possess a proteolytic potential to cleave a number of substrates. However, it is likely that specific roles are linked to specific interactions between proteases and substrates. For example, cathepsins B, H, K, L, and S cleave kininogen, thereby releasing the kinin peptide; however, only cathepsin K was shown to be able to cleave kinin at the naturally occurring cleavage site, supporting the above idea [133], [134].",

Cathepsin S is crucial for the processing of the invariant chain in bone-marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages [136], while the human V and mouse L are required for Ii processing in thymus. In addition, cathepsins generate peptides, which are presented to MHC class-II molecules. Cathepsin L was found indispensable for the generation of a specific peptides repertoire in cortical thymic epithelial cells, which is required for CD4+ T cell positive selection in thymus [137]. Considering the role of cathepsin S, an attempt was made to reveal the substrate specificity of cathepsin S by screening a peptide library [93]. For the purposes of validation the pattern of the cleavage sites on the Ii polypeptide was compared with the results of the peptide library screen, and, not surprisingly, some similarities were found. However, the cleavage sites in the invariant chain were numerous, so the question remains as to whether cathepsin S simply chops the Ii into smaller peptides or does cathepsin S perform a specific cleavage. Since cathepsins V/L were found to be crucial for the processing of the thymus MHC class-II Ii complex, it is evident that several proteases can do the same job. More recently, a new pathway for prohormone processing mediated by the secretory vesicle cathepsin L was described [138], [139].",

            "text": "Glycosaminoglycans play a crucial role in the formation of complexes between cysteine cathepsins and their protein substrates. GAGs have thus been shown to regulate the collagenolytic activity of human cysteine cathepsins [53], [140], [141]. Furthermore, for the collagenase activity of cathepsin K, its complex formation with chondroitin sulfate is mandatory [140]. In the cartilage, cathepsin K alone is capable of providing the source for GAGs by removing them from aggrecan [142]. The insight into the mechanism of this rather unique relationship was revealed by the crystal structure of the chondroitin sulfate-cathepsin K complex and the accompanying biochemical study [143]. In the crystal, several cathepsin K molecules bind to a single chondroitin sulfate at a site distant from the active site. This work suggested that in the cathepsin K-hydrolysis of collagen the role of chondroitin sulfate is to bring together and align several cathepsin K molecules in a way that makes possible the cleavage of the triple collagen helix. The chondroitin thus provides a scaffold for the association of cathepsin K molecules. This effect is not shared by cathepsin L [85]. Mutations in cathepsin K, which modified the chondroitin binding site in cathepsin K into cathepsin-L-like, decreased the collagenolytic activity of the protein. In the crystal structure of the complex between cathepsin-L-like cathepsin K and chondroitin sulfate, the latter still binds to cathepsin K; however, not in the same way as in the structure with native cathepsin K. To summarize, these studies have revealed the relevance of chondroitin sulfate binding to cathepsin K for collagene proteolysis. Nevertheless, modifying the binding site for chondroitin into cathepsin-L-like has not removed the collagenase activity. This indicates that cathepsin K possesses additional features that enable it to cleave collagen efficiently.",

This is reminiscent of the cathepsin B exo- and endopeptidyl activity [146], which was believed to be a result of the dissociation of ionizing groups in the binding cleft. When the structure of cathepsin B became available [63], it was evident that the occluding loop must be displaced in order to enable the endopeptidase activity of the enzyme. This was finally confirmed by mutations in the occluding loop, including the removal of its parts [82], [83]. In contrast to the exopeptidase cathepsin B, the cathepsin K fold does not provide an obvious structural feature on the surface of cathepsin K, which would trigger a change of state and thereby affect the substrate kinetics in a pH-dependent manner. As a possible mechanism, the oligomerization of cathepsin K has not been excluded by the experimental data. However, it remains open whether this behavior is consistent with the model of cathepsin K to form a \u201cbeads on a string\u201d structure, as earlier suggested [143].",

It has been further suggested that the attachment of migrating cells to extracellular matrix components is modulated [149]. Moreover, cathepsin X was found to cleave \u03b22 integrin, thereby demonstrating another way of regulating T-cell migration [150]. There are indications that cathepsin X removes the C-terminal residues of LFA-1, a \u03b22 integrin, thereby increasing its affinity for the adaptor protein talin [151], [152]. The subsequent cleavages result in the intermediate as well as the high-affinity LFA-1. The intermediate affinity form can associate with \u03b1-actinin 1, while the high-affinity form is crucial for the T-cell migration. Although not described in more details, cysteine cathepsins were shown to participate in the regulation of antimicrobial molecules by inactivation of the secretory leucoprotease inhibitor [153] and, even though in part disputed [154], in the processing of viruses, such as cathepsin L in the processing of the corona virus [155].",

The cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide occurs during the passage to the endoplasmic reticulum in parallel with the N-linked glycosylation. After the removal of the signal peptide, the propeptide assists in the proper folding of the enzyme and targeting to the endosomes/lysosomes using a specific mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) pathway, simultaneously acting as an inhibitor to prevent any inappropriate proteolytic activity of the zymogen [157], [158], [159]. Dissociation of the bound, immature M6PR occurs in the mildly acidic environment of the endosomes. After removal of the N-terminal propeptide, the mature proteolytically active cathepsins are released. These mature enzymes occur as single-chain or double-chain forms, without affecting their catalytic activity. The two-chain enzymes remain connected by disulphide bridges [160].",

In the structure of most proenzymes, the hydrophobic interactions, salt bridges and hydrogen-bonding interaction in the propeptide and between the propeptide and the mature enzyme exists. The exception is the structure of cathepsin X, in which the propeptide binds covalently to the mature enzyme with a disulphide bridge between the cysteine residue in the propeptide and the active-site cysteine, thus preventing any autocatalytic processing [167].

Some early studies suggested that autocatalytic processing is a unimolecular process [171], [172], while others proposed inter- and intra-molecular mechanisms [173], [175]. This enigma has been recently clarified. It is now clear that the auto-activation of cathepsins is a combination of a unimolecular and a bimolecular process [176]. Procathepsin B possesses a low catalytic activity that is, nevertheless, sufficient to trigger the autocatalytic activation of the zymogen. This activity is the result of the propeptide dissociation from the active-site cleft as the first step in this process, which is in fact the only unimolecular step in the process [177]. In the next step, which is already bimolecular, this catalytically active zymogen molecule processes and activates another procathepsin molecule in one or more steps. The mature cathepsin molecules generated in this way then initiate a chain reaction leading to a rapid activation of the remaining procathepsin molecules. Taken together, only endopeptidases such as the cathepsins B, H, L, S and K can be activated by the removal of the propeptide, whereas the true exopeptidases, such as the cathepsins C and X, required endopeptidases, such as the cathepsins L and S, for their activation [178].",

            "text": "Propeptides, which are removed during the processing of cysteine cathepsins, have been shown to be potent inhibitors of their cognate enzymes in vitro. The first such example was the synthetic propeptide of cathepsin B, which was found to inhibit cathepsin B at pH 6.0 with Ki\n = 0.4 nM, whereas at pH 4.0 the inhibition was much weaker [181]. This further suggested that during the activation at acidic pH the propeptide dissociates from the surface of the enzyme, thereby facilitating the activation, and this was then later experimentally confirmed [176]. Subsequently, the recombinant cathepsin L propeptide was found to inhibit cathepsin L with Ki\n = 0.088 nM and cathepsin S with Ki\n = 44.6 nM, whereas no inhibition of cathepsin B or papain was observed, providing the first evidence for propeptides acting as selective cathepsin inhibitors [182]. Further studies confirmed these findings and demonstrated that propeptides exhibit a limited selectivity of inhibition against their cognate enzymes [183]. Moreover, cathepsin S propeptide was found to be rapidly degraded by cathepsin L [184]. The latter, linked with the acidic, pH-induced unfolding and dissociation of the procathepsin B propeptide [176], suggests that the propeptides released during the zymogen activation are degraded, and as a result lose their inhibitory role. However, it should be noted that in the procathepsin structure the propeptide is covalently bound to the enzyme (Fig. 5), whereas all the in vitro studies mentioned above were performed with isolated peptides. Therefore, these studies do not necessarily reflect the in vivo situation. For more in-depth information about the structural aspects and function of the propeptides see [160], [185], [186].",

            "text": "In spite of their similar biological function, the propeptides of cysteine cathepsins show very little similarity in their amino acid sequence. This is in striking contrast to the strong overall homology between the majority of their mature forms. However, this can probably be explained by the need for a selective inhibition of their cognate enzymes during trafficking to the endolysosomal compartments and subsequent degradation after the processing to prevent the sustained inhibition of the cathepsins in the lysosomes. A sequence analyses of the family of papain-like cysteine proteases led to the recognition of two distinct subfamilies, designated as cathepsin-L-like and cathepsin-B-like proteases, which can be distinguished by both the propeptide and mature enzyme structure [186], [187]. The main difference between the subfamilies exists in the sequence of the propeptides and their length [17]. Propeptides of the cathepsin L subfamily (cathepsins L, V, K, S, W, F and H) contain a propeptide of about 100 residues, with two conserved motifs: a highly conserved ERFNIN motif and the GNFD motif. The former is lacking in the cathepsin B subfamily, while the propeptides of cathepsins C, O and X lack the ERFNIN motif. The propeptide of cathepsin X contains only 38 residues and is the shortest of the cathepsins [188], [189]. In contrast, the cathepsin F propeptide with 251 residues is the longest of the human cathepsins and contains, in addition, an N-terminal cystatin-like domain [190], [191]. The propeptide of cathepsin C contains 206 residues [192]. Interestingly, after the removal of the 87 propeptide residues during proteolytic activation, the remaining 119 residues become part of the structure of the mature cathepsin C responsible for its dipeptidyl peptidase activity, known as the exclusion domain [70].",

Basically, they are competitive, reversible, tight-binding inhibitors, preventing substrate binding to the same active site. Some basic principles of the kinetics of the interaction between inhibitors and proteases, as well as their physiological role, are discussed. In short, based on their physiological role, they are divided into emergency and regulatory inhibitors [14]. Typical emergency inhibitors are cystatins, which are separated from their target enzymes and primarily act on escaped proteases [14] or proteases of invading pathogens [193]. This was also demonstrated for thyropins [194]. Regulatory inhibitors not only block but also modulate the protease activity. Moreover, they are often co-localized with their target enzymes and are classified into threshold-type, buffer-type and delay-type inhibitors. Buffer-type inhibitors keep proteases complexed in the absence of substrates and release them in the presence of substrates, thus preventing inappropriate proteolysis. Propeptides of lysosomal cathepsins most likely belong to this type of inhibitors (reviewed in [17], [181]). All these four types of inhibitors (emergency, threshold, buffer and delay) are important to keep the necessary balance under normal physiological conditions [14].",

            "text": "Kininogens have been known for several decades as the precursor molecules of the kinins found predominantly in the blood plasma of mammals and in some other species. Although kinins could be released through two major pathways involving either the plasma kallikrein-kinin system or tissue kallikrein, an alternative route may involve cysteine cathepsins [214]. Kininogens are multifunctional and multidomain glycoproteins comprising three distinct types: high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), low-molecular-weight kininogen (LK) and T-kininogen (TK), an acute phase protein only found in rats [215]. Both human HK and LK are products of the same gene, resulting from the alternative mRNA splicing [216], while TK is encoded by the TK-gene [217]. The mature kininogens are single-chain proteins with multiple domains [218], [219]. After cleavage by kallikreins, they release the kinin segment and are converted into two-chain proteins, a heavy- and a light-chain [218]. The heavy chains of HK and LK have an identical amino acid sequence, whereas the light-chain of HK is much longer than that of LK [199], [200]. The molecular mass of LK is 51 kDa [220] and 84 kDa for HK [221]. The heavy chains of HK and LK are composed of three tandemly repeated type 2 cystatin-like domains (domains 1, 2, 3) containing eight disulphide bridges. Only the second and third domains inhibit the papain-like proteases [222]. The inhibitory domains 2 and 3 are more closely related than domain 1. Both HK and LK bind two molecules of various cysteine proteases including cathepsins and cruzipain with high affinity [220], [221]. In contrast, in vitro studies showed that the aspartic protease cathepsin D inactivates the third domain of the human kininogen and cystatin C, suggesting a role for cathepsin D in regulating the activity of cysteine cathepsins at acidic pH [223]. It was recently demonstrated that HK regulates the endothelial function, thus serving as a cardioprotective peptide [224]. Some other studies showed some novel function of kininogens, such as the regulation of angiogenesis (reviewed in [225]). Like type 2 cystatins, the kininogens are grouped into subfamily I25B of the cystatin family I25 [210].",

This finding was confirmed by the discovery of a new protein, equistatin, isolated from the sea anemone Actinia equina, strongly inhibiting cathepsin L and papain [228] and human cathepsin D [229]. The determined amino acid sequences of the equistatin [228] and p41 fragment [227] showed no homology to cystatins, but a significant homology to thyroglobulin type-1 domains, which are present in prohormone thyroglobulin [230]. Therefore, the name thyropins has been suggested for this new group of proteins [231]. In equistatin, as a three-domain protein, the N-terminal domain 1 is responsible for the inhibition of papain-like proteases [228], whereas the second domain inhibits cathepsin D [229], [232]. Thyroglobulin type-1 domains are also present in several functionally unrelated proteins [14]. Thyropins are grouped into family I31 of clan IX [210]. More details can be found in a recent review [233].",

Both expressed homologous salivary proteins, sialostatin L [239] and sialostatin L2 [240], strongly inhibited, almost equally, cathepsin L with Ki\n = 4.7 nM and cathepsin V with Ki\n = 57 nM, while no inhibition of cathepsins B, X and C was observed. Cathepsin L as collagenolytic enzyme hydrolyzes ECM proteins, such as collagen and elastin, and it was shown that its collagenolytic activity can be inhibited by chicken cystatin [241].

            "text": "Cystatins and stefins are tight-reversible binding protein inhibitors of papain-like cysteine proteases (reviewed in [10], [14], [199], [200], [202], [237]). The interaction with their target enzymes can be very tight, a Ki value of ~10 fM has been determined for the interaction between cystatin C and papain [246]. An important step in the elucidation of the molecular mechanism by which these protein inhibitors inhibit their target enzymes was the determination of the crystal structure of chicken cystatin [247] and the successfully prepared recombinant human stefin B [248] in a complex with S-carboxymethylated papain [249]. Both inhibitors, cystatin and stefin B, consist of a long, five-turn \u03b1-helix and a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-pleated sheet, with an additional helix or strand, respectively [247], [249]. These structural data provided strong evidence that there are three regions crucial for the interaction with their cognate enzymes: the amino terminus and two hairpin loops. An exposed first \u03b2-hairpin loop (comprising a highly conserved QVVAG region or similar sequence QXVXG) is flanked on either side by the projecting N-terminal segment and the highly conserved second \u03b2-hairpin loop, which contains the highly conserved Pro-Trp dipeptide. Both hairpin loops and the amino terminus form a tripartite, mainly hydrophobic, wedge-shaped edge, containing most of the conserved residues and segments involved in binding, highly complementary to the active-site cleft of papain. The N-terminal truncated forms of chicken cystatin confirmed the crucial importance for binding of the residues preceding the conserved Gly9 residue [250]. The hydrophobic side-chain interactions stabilized the complex. In cystatin and stefin complexes the interactions in the S2 subsite strengthen the complexes with papain considerably [250], [251], [252]. However, it was reported that in spite of considerable similarity between the structural feature of free stefin A in solution [253] and the crystal of the homologous protein stefin B in complex with papain [249], there are some important differences in the regions that are crucial for protein binding, such as the five N-terminal residues and the second binding loop [253]. Similarly, the comparison of the chicken cystatin structure determined by X-ray crystallography [247] and NMR [254] showed significant differences in the structurally variable segments of the polypeptide chain. These findings suggested that the binding of cystatin/stefin type inhibitors cannot be satisfactorily explained solely on the basis of the stefin B-papain complex [249]. The crystal structure of stefin A, in complex with the papain-like exopeptidase cathepsin H showed some distinct differences [255]. The N-terminal residue of stefin A adopted the form of a hook, which slightly displays a cathepsin H mini-chain and distorted a small part of the structure. The recently determined crystal structure of human stefin A\u2013cathepsin B complex indicated that the papain-like part of the cathepsin B structure remains unmodified upon the binding of stefin A, whereas the occluding loop residues are displaced [256]. Consequently, cathepsin B can bind certain ligands along the whole interdomain interphase, such as inhibitors or substrates. On the other hand, cathepsin B is poorly inhibited by kininogens due to the residues His110-His111 positioned within its occluding loop. The His110Ala cathepsin B mutant, unlike its His111Ala mutant, does not hydrolyze kininogens but forms a tight-binding complex [257].",

However, it was reported that mouse stefin A variants discriminate between papain-like endopeptidases, such as cathepsins L and S, and the exopeptidases cathepsins B, C and H. The interaction with exopeptidases is several orders of magnitude weaker compared to the human, porcine and bovine stefins [258]. Namely, bovine stefins A, B and C inhibit rapidly and tightly endopeptidases such as papain, cathepsin L and S in the pM range, whereas cathepsin B does so very poorly [212], [259], [260]. Furthermore, it was shown that human cystatin C, stefins B and chicken cystatin strongly inhibit the endopeptidase cruzipain from T. cruzi with Ki\n = 1.4\u201372 pM [261].",

This fragment was isolated in a complex with cathepsin L [194] and its crystal structure was determined [74]. The structure of the p41 fragment demonstrates a new fold consisting of two sub-domains connected by disulphide bonds. The wedge-shaped and three-loop arrangement of this fragment bound to the active-site cleft of cathepsin L is reminiscent of the binding of cystatins [74], thus demonstrating the first example of convergent evolution observed in cysteine protease inhibitors, similar to chagasin [262]. Recently, it has been shown that the p41 fragment inhibits human cathepsins V, K, S and F and mouse cathepsin L with Ki values in the nM range [263] in addition to human cathepsin L [227] and cruzipain [226]. These findings suggest that the regulation of the proteolytic activity of most of the cysteine cathepsins by the p41 fragment has an important and wideranging control mechanism of antigen presentation [263]. Similar to the p41 fragment, equistatin binds rapidly and tightly to papain and cathepsin L, but with a lower affinity to cathepsin B [228].",

            "text": "Early studies of the evolution of the cystatin superfamily were based on a small sample of taxonomic diversity and diversity within the cystatin superfamily [200], [264]. Since then, the number of representatives across the mammals, plants, viruses and parasites increased mainly due to the accumulation of mammalian and plant genomic sequences. In addition, several genes, including CRES (cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic), testatin and cystatin-T related to the cystatins, were identified but lack consensus sites that are important for inhibition [238]. Gradually, the numerous proteins containing cystatin domain(s) have been discovered, resulting in a challenging problem of their comprehensive evolutionary classification. A detailed analysis of more than 2100 prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes provided strong evidence for the emergence of the cystatin superfamily in the ancestors of eukaryotes [206]. A primordial gene duplication resulted in only two ancestral eukaryotic lineages, stefins and cystatins. While stefins remained the intracellular proteins responsible for regulation of an endogenous protein turnover, cystatins gained a signal peptide and emerged as extracellular inhibitors responsible for regulation of an exogenous protein turnover involved in host-pathogen/parasite predator interactions. Therefore, stefins may function as inhibitors of endogenous cysteine proteases, whereas cystatins function as inhibitors of exogenous cysteine proteases. It is noteworthy that intracellular stefins are more conserved than very divergent extracellular cystatins. Moreover, the first diversification of cystatins occurred in the ancestors of vertebrates when the first orthologous families emerged. This indicates that functional diversification has occurred in multicellular eukaryotes, often resulting in a loss of the ancestral inhibitory activity, gaining novel functions in innate immunity. Furthermore, the observed distribution of stefins and cystatins in bacterial genomes is very limited. This suggests that the bacterial stefins and cystatins may serve as emergency inhibitors, thus enabling the survival of bacteria in the host, defending them from the host's proteolytic activity by inhibiting cysteine cathepsins.",

            "text": "Cathepsins, in particular cathepsin B, were first linked to cancer as long as 30 years ago [300]. It is now clear that the cathepsins have an important role in both tumor progression and invasion, which is supported by the numerous clinical reports and results from experimental mouse-cancer models [301], [302], [303]. Elevated cathepsin expression and/or activity has been shown to be associated with cancer progression in a number of different types of tumors [304], [305], [306], [307], [308], [309]. Moreover, the level of cathepsin expression positively correlated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients and was suggested to be a potential prognostic marker [310], [311], [312]. In addition, serum cathepsin levels have been positively correlated with metastasis [313]. The roles of cathepsins in the individual tumor-biological processes were also confirmed ex vivo using cell-based systems. As such, the cathepsins B, L and some others have been shown to promote the migration and invasion of tumor cells [314], [315], [316], [317], [318], [319]. In addition to their well-known function associated with the ECM degradation and remodeling in the tumor microenvironment, cathepsins were suggested to participate in the proteolytic cascade activation (Fig. 6\n). The activation of pro-uPA and other proteases, which was demonstrated in vitro, would thus potentiate their effect on the dissolution of the tumor matrix and the basement membrane [320], [321], [322], [323], which is a prerequisite for invasion and metastasis. To fulfill these functions cathepsins have to be localized at the extracellular space, in order to have access to the bulk of potential targets and processes affecting tumor progression. As a confirmation of cathepsin secretion, increased serum levels of these proteases in cancer patients have been detected [304], [324], [325], [326], [327], [328]. Despite the extracellular functions of cysteine cathepsins, intracellular cathepsins could participate in tumor progression, affecting processes acting both as pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic [329]. As an example of intracellular pro-tumorigenic activity, cathepsins could participate in intracellular collagen degradation [330], [331], [332], [333]. Moreover, this role of cysteine cathepsins in normal and malignant extracellular matrix degradation is in agreement with the finding that the endocytic transmembrane glycoprotein uPA receptor-associated protein directs the collagen IV for lysosomal delivery and degradation [333]. On the other hand, cathepsins have recently attracted considerable attention as potential mediators in programmed cell death (apoptosis) [38], a key process in cancer development and progresion [334]. However, evidence has been accumulated for multiple scenarios of how cysteine cathepsins promote cell death. For example, after their release from the lysosomes they could engage the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by the activation of caspases indirectly through the degradation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and the proteolytic activation of Bid (Fig. 6). Moreover, their ability to cleave XIAP suggests their involvement in the control of apoptosis, both upstream and downstream of mitochondria [58].",

It has been found that a higher level of cathepsin inhibitors in different types of cancer correlates with a favorable prognosis for cancer patients [335], [336]. On the other hand, an increased concentration of stefins in the body fluids of carcinoma patients, correlated significantly with shorter survival times [337], [338]. Although a higher level of cathepsin inhibitors may counterbalance the up-regulation of cysteine cathepsins, their role in cancer remains poorly defined, and this calls for further investigations to be performed [339].",

            "text": "Additional evidence confirming the important role of cathepsins in cancer progression was provided by the use of cathepsins-knockout technology and transgenic cancer models in small animals. In the same year, two research groups have independently shown the effect of major cathepsin/cathepsins depletion on tumor development, progression, and metastasis in two murine cancer models: (i) pancreatic islet cell carcinoma (RIP1-Tag2) [340] and (ii) MMTV-PyMT mouse mammary cancer [341], as summarized in Table 2\n. The depletion of cathepsin B in both cancer models resulted in a significantly reduced tumor burden and a delay in the development of high-grade carcinomas. Furthermore, while in the RIP1-Tag2 model a significant 44% decrease in the proliferation of the tumor cells was detected, the proliferation index was reduced in 10-week-old mice by 12%, but not in mice that were 14 weeks old. In contrast to the RIP1-Tag2 model, no differences in tumor vascularization and apoptosis have been detected in the MMTV-PyMT model of breast cancer [341], which was confirmed by a follow-up report [342]. Moreover, it has been shown that the genetic ablation of cathepsin B in primary MMTV-PyMT tumor cells induces the membrane translocation of another carboxypeptidase, cathepsin X, that restores the invasive capability of tumor cells and annihilates the effect of the principal protease deletion at the level of lung metastasis [341]. This first report on such a cathepsin-compensation effect has been further confirmed by the use of double cathepsin B and X knockout mice crossed with the MMTV-PyMT mouse model, providing evidence for the synergistic anticancer effects of both carboxypeptidases [342].",

The cancer state is currently viewed as a product of its microenvironment [343]. Therefore, new technologies that enable the targeting of the tumor microenvironment would represent an efficient approach to cancer prevention and intervention [344]. Indeed, such a technology was recently provided by the development of a novel, targeted, drug-delivery system enabling the targeting of both the tumors and their microenvironment [345]. Moreover, the targeting of JPM-565, a small-molecule inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, which was very potent in the treatment of pancreatic islet tumors in a mouse model [346], lacked any efficacy in a mouse breast-cancer model due to the very poor bioavailability of the compound [347]. The respective anti-tumor therapy using JPM-565 proved to be very successful, resulting in a significant reduction in tumor growth [345], thereby proving the concept of stroma targeting and the cathepsins as potent targets in cancer treatment. Therefore, the application of selective inhibitors of cathepsins offers new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.",

            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic synovial joint inflammation and the infiltration of an activated CD4+ T cell and APC, such as dendritic cells and macrophages [348]. It involves a progressive destruction of the articular cartilage, eventually leading to a loss of joint function. In addition to metalloproteases, such as collagenases and aggrecanases, lysosomal cysteine cathepsins B and L have been identified in synovial fluids [349], [350], [351], [352]. Furthermore, the involvement of cathepsin B and L in bone degradation was demonstrated by the selective inhibition of these enzymes [353]. In addition, the expression of the potent ECM degrading enzyme, cathepsin K, was found in synovial fibroblasts from RA patients to correlate with the severity of the disease [354]. There have been reports of an interesting finding that the chondroitin sulfate found in synovial fluids stabilizes the cathepsin K activity and subsequently increases its collagenolytic activity [355]. Very recently, it was reported that neither cathepsin B nor cathepsin H serum levels were associated with this disease, while the progression of destruction was associated with high serum levels of the inhibitors stefin A and B and not cystatin C [356]. In addition, it was found that cathepsin B and significantly elevated cathepsin S were detected in the synovial fluid of RA patients [357]. Significantly, an elevated level of cathepsin S is consistent with its critical role in the immune response. Recent developments in medical treatments may contribute to more effective and safe treatments of rheumatoid arthritis and ostheoarthritis using specific inhibitors [358], [359].",

            "text": "Over the past two decades we have witnessed tremendous advances in the understanding of the properties and structures of cysteine cathepsins and their endogenous protein inhibitors cystatins; although most of our knowledge has emerged only recently. The understanding of the basic biology of these proteins under normal and pathological conditions is constantly improving, although additional rules have yet to be more precisely established. The application of genomic and proteomic approaches to identify new substrates of individual cathepsins uncovers new roles for these enzymes in vivo\n[360], [361]. New strategies for the in vivo imaging of cysteine cathepsin activity for designing selective enzyme activity-based probes are in progress. Computational approaches based on the three-dimensional structure of domain\u2013domain interactions involving cysteine cathepsins and their protein inhibitors should provide a more comprehensive view of this biological system [362]. By exploring the insights into the cysteine cathepsins biology of humans, new emerging therapies in various diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory diseases, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and parasitic diseases, are developing with a high probability of being incorporated into clinical trials.",

The PDB codes of the structures are as follows: cathepsin B (1huc) [63], cathepsin C (1k3b) [70], cathepsin F (1m6d) [73], cathepsin H (8pch) [67], cathepsin K (1mem) [65], cathepsin L (1icf) [74], cathepsin S (1glo) [72], cathepsin V (1fh0) [69], cathepsin X (1ef7) [68], and papain (9pap) [61].

Extracellular cysteine cathepsins promote tumor progression by initiating a proteolytic cascade that results in the activation of a urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and plasminogen. Collectively, active proteases, including cysteine cathepsins themselves, can degrade all of the components of the extracellular matrix, promoting tumor progression and metastasis. The degradation of cell-adhesion proteins (e.g., E-cadherin) would additionally increase the disseminative ability of tumor cells. Alternatively, translocated into the cytosol cysteine cathepsins are shown to act as initiator proteases in lysosome-mediated cell death through the degradation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and the proteolytic activation of Bid, engaging the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.",
