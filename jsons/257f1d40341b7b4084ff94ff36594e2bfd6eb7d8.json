CBCT is one of many image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) tools used for the verification of patient set-up to ensure accurate radiotherapy (RT) delivery [15] . In patients undergoing breast or thoracic RT, the lungs are encompassed in the daily CBCT, allowing the unique opportunity to monitor lung findings over several weeks. Typically, bone and soft tissue windows are utilized to allow for anatomic matching on specified structures for RT targeting.

The imaging features of this viral pneumonia are diverse, typically ranging from normal appearance to diffuse changes in the lungs; patients with multiple comorbidities are more likely to have bilateral and diffuse disease [10] . Overall, there is a slight predilection for the right lower lobe. The extent of disease on CT increases gradually from the subclinical period throughout the first 3 weeks, then decreases thereafter [10] , but radiographic changes may continue to evolve beyond 26 days of symptoms [10, 12] . Asymptomatic patients are more likely to have unilateral, multifocal GGOs. After symptom onset, bilateral and diffuse GGOs are predominant. In the progressive stage, GGOs are relatively decreased in frequency, with a transition to consolidation and mixed-pattern development. As the disease peaks, GGOs decrease further, and peak lung involvement is characterized by increasing crazy-paving patterns, reticulation, along with bronchiolectasis and thickening of the adjacent pleura. The resolving stage demonstrates decreasing consolidation and absence of crazy-paving patterns following the first 2-3 weeks of disease [11] [12] [13] [23] [24] [25] . Our patient's radiographic changes were generally consistent with the above findings; during the subclinical period, GGO's were predominantly located in the peripheral right lower lobe and progressed in the symptomatic stage to become more diffuse and bilateral. Based on our patient's available imaging, her CT lung abnormalities appeared to peak in severity approximately 11 days after symptom onset, followed by gradual resolution of GGO's as demonstrated in her diagnostic CTs ( Figure 3 ).",

Timely detection has been shown to be associated with improved clinical outcomes and prognosis [27] . One retrospective series demonstrated as many as 75% of patients with negative RT-PCR COVID-19 testing had positive CT findings; some patients continued to test negative on repeat RT-PCR before eventually testing positive, indicating CT findings may have greater sensitivity than RT-PCR. Interestingly, 40% of patients had improvement in CT findings prior to serial RT-PCR results converting from positive to negative [13] , suggesting RT-PCR results lag behind radiographic findings.",

At the time of CT simulation, the patient did not report fever or respiratory symptoms and her lung parenchyma on the CT simulation was normal. Approximately 2 weeks later, in March 2020, RT was initiated and the patient remained asymptomatic. The patient was treated on our Varian Halcyon unit, utilizing daily KV CBCTs for patient set-up. During the first week of treatment, no radiographic pulmonary abnormalities were noted on daily review of the CBCT soft tissue windows. The patient presented on Monday morning for her 6 th fraction of RT and upon COVID-19 verbal screening at the entrance to the cancer center, she reported a 2-day history of fatigue and fever, with a peak temperature of 101F. She had no other complaints and denied respiratory symptoms. Her vital signs were within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation was at her baseline of 95-98% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed good air entry bilaterally with no adventitious sounds. Due to the limited access of SARS-CoV-2 testing in New York City, outpatient testing was not available, and the patient's symptoms were not severe enough to warrant referral to the emergency room. As per departmental guidelines based on CDC recommendations [20], the patient's RT was held until she became afebrile without antipyretics for at least 72 hours and at least 7 days from symptom onset. The patient's 5 CBCTs from the first week of RT were reviewed retrospectively and peripheral, predominantly right lower lobe GGOs were noted on the CBCT obtained at the 4 th and 5 th fractions, in the two days prior to her symptom onset (Figure 1). The patient was monitored daily via telemedicine. She remained febrile with fatigue and anorexia. On the 4 th day",

            "text": "Traditionally, patients treated with breast tangent RT do not undergo daily IGRT, but rather weekly portal imaging. The Varian Halcyon 2.0 platform utilizes KV CBCT, and iterative CBCT imaging for improved soft tissue definition [29]. Patients with thoracic and breast malignancies undergoing treatment on the Halcyon receive CBCT for set-up verification, which opportunely encompasses the lungs. Pulmonary infiltrates potentially indicative of infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be identifiable on routine daily CBCTs, which would not otherwise have been appreciable with KV orthogonal imaging or weekly portal imaging. Given the relatively high proportion of breast cancer patients treated in most radiation oncology departments, Halcyon's daily KV CBCT imaging presents a unique opportunity for lung evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suppli et al. have reported on early pulmonary findings discovered on retrospective review of daily CBCTs done in a lung cancer patient admitted to the ICU during RT, who ultimately died of COVID-19 infection [30]. In our institution, this case prompted the initiation of a protocol for the prospective review of thoracic CBCTs in patients undergoing RT in an effort to detect pulmonary changes suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonitis. With the limited access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in NYC and the risk of false negative RT-PCR despite abnormal CT chest findings, the utility of a laboratory test in identifying asymptomatic or suspected infected cancer patients may be impractical. Given that imaging characteristics have been shown to correlate with clinical severity and progression of disease, the combination of clinical and laboratory findings, and acquaintance with typical radiographic COVID-19 related changes may facilitate the prompt diagnosis of these patients, leading to immediate quarantine and/or treatment and decreased risk of unintended dissemination.Conclusion:COVID-19 has impacted the United States on a level not seen since the influenza pandemic of 1918, and NYC rapidly became the epicenter of the pandemic. Due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic patients and the limited availability of outpatient SARS-CoV-2 testing, a combination of screening for symptoms, clinical acumen, and use of available technology is necessary for the prompt identification and management of these patients. As many cancer patients undergo routine CBCT during RT, familiarity with COVID-related lung changes may lead to earlier detection, diagnosis and treatment, while decreasing inadvertent dissemination amongst this vulnerable patient population.",

CBCT on the day of RT resumption demonstrated substantial worsening of the GGO compared with those obtained during the asymptomatic phase. Diagnostic CTs demonstrated bilateral, peripheral GGOs and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, findings suggesting COVID-19 pneumonitis. Repeat diagnostic CT three days later showed improved pulmonary findings and the patient resumed RT without incident. Conclusion: Familiarity with typical CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonitis may allow for early detection in cancer patients undergoing CBCT for RT treatment. Prompt review of the lung windows is recommended in order to identify such changes, with the hope that pre-symptomatic Title: Covert Covid-19: CBCT Lung Changes in An Asymptomatic Patient Receiving",
