            "text": "Diagnosis: COVID Toes (CT). There has been recent discussion regarding less common clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. One such possible symptom has been labeled CT. Individuals report areas of red or purple discoloration on the feet or hands, sometimes accompanied by a burning sensation, pain or tenderness. Initial lesions are papular and may evolve over one week to become purpuric and flattened. 1 Affected patients are often in their second or third decade of life, but symptoms have also been reported in older adults. CT is unique because it tends to appear in asymptomatic or mildly affected patients. Most report spontaneous resolution within two weeks. The exact mechanism remains unclear. Suggested etiologies include local vasculitis or thrombotic events. One study found all COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit to have acro-ischemia. 2 Similar manifestations have been found in other diseases. However, the incidence of CT has been higher than expected since the COVID-19 pandemic onset. Furthermore, a recent report found that 20% of COVID-19 patients had skin-related symptoms. 3 Although experts argue whether CT is a symptom of COVID-19, all agree that the medical community should be aware of CT as a possible symptom.",
