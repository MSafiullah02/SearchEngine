            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, resulting in an estimated 1.5 million adult hospitalizations annually in the United States [1\u2022, 2]. Despite advances in sepsis recognition and management and being a core measure by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the in-hospital mortality of patients admitted with CAP remains high at 6.5% with all-cause mortality at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year estimated to be 13%, 23%, and 31%, respectively [1\u2022, 3]. The broad spectrum of pathogens causing CAP remains unchanged and includes typical bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis), atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella spp.), viruses (such as rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus) and less frequently Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and mycobacteria [4]. While diagnostic techniques to facilitate the accurate identification of causative agents have improved, including the rapid evolution of commercial multiplex PCR assays, an etiologic agent is identified in fewer than half of CAP cases and frequently leaves clinicians to rely on empiric antimicrobials for management [5, 6\u2022].",

In addition to conventional diagnostic tests, extensive molecular and serologic testing was employed to characterize causative pathogens. In this cohort, human rhinovirus, influenza, and S. pneumoniae were the most common etiologic agents. Atypical pathogens were infrequently identified\u2014with the incidence of M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila each representing less than 0.5 cases per 10,000 adults in the community. This study provides contemporary, comprehensive microbiologic CAP data that is essential in informing guidelines and choosing empiric therapies wisely.

Houck et al. similarly evaluated a retrospective cohort of Medicare patients hospitalized with pneumonia in 10 western states during the years 1993, 1995, and 1997 [25]. Therapy with a macrolide in combination with a beta-lactam was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (aOR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25\u20130.69) in 1993 but this effect was not observed during the other years of study. Dudas et al. subsequently performed a prospective, observational cohort study at 72 community hospitals to evaluate compliance with ATS guidelines in patients with non-severe community-acquired pneumonia and compared outcomes between patients administered varying combinations of antimicrobials [26]. Compliance with ATS guidelines was found to be 81% and the addition of a macrolide to a beta-lactam was associated with decreased mortality and reduced length of hospital stay. Brown et al. further reinforced these findings by evaluating a retrospective cohort of 44,814 patients in a hospital claims database [27]. In this cohort, macrolide combination therapy was associated with decreased mortality, length of hospital stay, and healthcare-associated costs overall.",

The routine use of macrolides in hospitalized adults to augment the spectrum of antimicrobial coverage in mild to moderate CAP patients to include atypical pathogens has been questioned owing to the infrequent identification of these pathogens. M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae are also specifically known for producing relatively mild illness with minimal existing literature that targeted antibiotic therapy impacts patient mortality [28]. Additionally, any adjunctive benefit from the postulated anti-inflammatory effect of macrolides in the treatment of CAP remains unproven. Given the increasing resistance of S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae isolates to macrolide antibiotics, unnecessary exposure to potential harms associated with macrolide use (potential cardiotoxicity, Clostridium difficile infection, etc.), and the economic costs of unnecessary combination therapy, many have called the routine use of combination beta-lactams plus macrolides into question [29\u201333].",

In 28 trials, including 5939 patients hospitalized with CAP, there was no overall difference in mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 0.84\u20131.55) between the atypical and the typical coverage arms. A trend towards fewer clinical failures was observed in the atypical therapy arm, but this did not achieve statistical significance (RR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.84\u20131.04). Of note, the Cochrane Review only included one study that specifically focused on the comparison of beta-lactam monotherapy to beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy. Asadi et al. also compared macrolides to other treatment regimens in adults hospitalized with CAP in a systematic review and meta-analysis including 23 studies and 137,574 patients [35]. While overall macrolide use was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality when compared to non-macrolide use, the survival advantage disappeared (4.6 vs 4.1%; RR 1.13; 95% CI: 0.65\u20131.98) when analyses were restricted to RCTs.",

The study was conducted in six acute care hospitals in Switzerland from 2009 to 2013. The primary endpoint in this trial was the proportion of patients not achieving clinical stability at day 7. After 7 days of therapy, 41% in the monotherapy arm and 33% in the combination arm had not reached clinical stability (7% difference, p = 0.07), exceeding the predefined non-inferiority boundary. Patients identified to have atypical pathogens or severe pneumonia (PSI \u2265 4) were less likely to reach clinical stability with monotherapy while patients infected with typical pathogens or mild to moderate CAP severity (PSI 1 to 3) had equivalent outcomes. Secondary endpoints that included overall mortality, need for ICU admission, complications, length of stay, and recurrence of pneumonia within 90 days did not differ significantly between the two groups.",

Adult patients were included if they demonstrated radiographic evidence of pneumonia and compatible clinical findings. Patients were excluded if they had cystic fibrosis, positive Legionella antigen, recent hospitalization, or were from a long-term care facility.

Adjusted comparisons for 90-day all-cause mortality favored beta-lactam monotherapy with a 1.9% lower risk of death when compared to macrolide combination therapy (90% CI: \u22120.6 to 4.4). Time to oral antibiotic de-escalation, length of hospital stay, and occurrence of complications during hospital stay were not significantly different between the groups.
