Methods Basal hormone milieu, defective response of both innate and adaptive immune system and sedentariness are major determinants in the severity of influenza viral infection in obese patients. Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic. Results Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions. Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise. Conclusions Due to prolonged viral shedding, quarantine in obese subjects should likely be longer than normal weight individuals.",

This unfavorable hormone milieu also leads to a dysregulation of the immune response and can contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-linked complications [8] . In the basal state, obese patients have a higher concentration of several pro-inflammatory cytokines like alpha-TNF, MCP-1 and IL-6, mainly produced by visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue leading to a defect in the innate immunity [9] . When an antigen is presented, the obesity-related chronic inflammation causes a reduced macrophage activation and a blunted pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon macrophage stimulation [10] . The reduced macrophage activation after an antigen is presented explaining the poor vaccination success of obese subjects [11] ; this unique obesogenic microenvironment explains the emergence of antiviral-resistant and vaccine escape variants in the obese population [11, 12] . Also B and T cell responses are impaired in obese and obese-diabetic patients, and this causes an increased susceptibility and a delay of resolution of the viral infection.",

In fact, in obese mice there is a delayed and blunted immune response, probably due to a reduced interferon (INF), adaptive cellular and antibody-mediated responses. Recently, Honce et al. found that serial passaging of a human H1N1 influenza virus through diet-induced models of obesity mice (DIO) or genetically obese mice (OB) results in a more virulent disease with an increased virulence and morbidity; in the mouse model, deep-sequencing viruses revealed several mutations in obese host-passaged viruses and an impairment of the interferon response is permissive for the generation of more virulent IAV populations. These findings are not limited by viral subtype and are also found in human studies. Diminished INF response and an increased influenza virus replication were found in normal bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells derived from obese subjects [16] [17] [18] .",

The delay in producing interferon to contrast viral replication allows more viral RNA replication increasing the chances of the appearance of novel, more virulent viral strains [18] .

Adenovirus 36 (Adv36) is the most studied infectious agent probably associated to obesity. Adenoviruses are DNA viruses causing mainly respiratory infections which were indicated both in animal models and in humans to be contributing factors for increased adiposity [24] (Fig. 1) . Atkinson et al. showed in over 500 individuals and 28 twin pairs a correlation between BMI and Adv36 positivity, with 30% of positivity in obese vs 11% positivity in lean individuals [24] . The proposed mechanisms via which Adv36 infection may lead to obesity are several: First, the increase in chronic inflammation via rise in MCP-1 (macrophage chemoattractant protein I) which is activated by NF-kB [25] . Second, a reduction in leptin expression in the adipocytes leading to lipid accumulation by a decrease in lipolysis, a downregulation of the adipocyte genes involved in lipid oxidation and fatty acid synthesis [26] . Third, the increase in glucose uptake in the adipocytes leads to an energy surplus in the cells glucose-dependent [27] . Fourth, an up-regulation of adipogenesis is due to an improvement in adipocyte proliferation and differentiation [28] . Particularly, PPAR gamma genes and other RNA expressions factors related to adipocyte genesis increase.",

This pattern resembles an insulin-resistant condition with a reduction in the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity, usually involved in the rate of carbohydrate oxidation control. PDC is an important modulator of energy and metabolic homeostasis, and insulin resistance is associated with increased skeletal muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) that phosphorylates and inactivates PDC. Increased PDK4 expression in muscle has been observed in insulinresistant status, including obesity [14, 30] . In mice infected by the H1N1 virus, there is a marked down-regulation of PDC activity and ATP level, with selective up-regulation of PDK4 in the skeletal muscles, heart, liver and lungs.",

Along this line, Zheng et al. showed that regular exercise enhances the immune response against microbial antigens in humans [19] . It is interesting to note that positive immunomodulation can be achieved only with mild-to-moderate intensity exercise. In contrast, highintensity or prolonged exercise (like running a marathon) is known to deplete the immune response, mainly due to the increase in endogenous cortisol [37] .

AMPK is an enzyme that exerts anti-inflammatory effect upon activation, and it is also recognized as a stimulator of PPARs [40, 41] . In a murine model, Zhao et al. demonstrated that the administration of AICAR resulted in a decreased severity of lung injury and pro-inflammatory processes, as determined by diminished neutrophil accumulation and lowered levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [42] .",

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are key regulators of inflammation and lipid metabolism, their activation results specifically in a reduction in inflammatory cytokines (as IL6, INF \u03b3) [40] . Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone (two PPAR\u03b3 agonists) are insulin-mimetic drugs used in type 2 diabetes with high overall potential in reducing influenza virus infection [40] . Pioglitazone seems to suppress inflammation by reducing MCP-1 expression, an important mediator of host inflammation [40] . Pioglitazone was shown to increase survival of infected mice up to 40%, and the benefit may be attributed to modulation of subject inflammatory response [40, 41] . The combination of pioglitazone and AICAR increase survival of infected mice from 30 up to 100% [41] . Therefore, metformin, AICAR and PPAR\u03b3 agonists, in combination or alone, might be studied and then used in the treatment of severe influenza in association with other antiviral/immunomodulatory drugs in the future.",

Being obese not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but recent evidence indicates that a large obese population increases the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually may increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic. Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, stated that isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary intervention, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following for our obese and obese-diabetic patients: 1. lose weight with a mild caloric restriction. In addition to the obvious positive effect of weight loss, caloric restriction activates AMP-kinase, potentiating the immunomodulatory effect of physical exercise; 2. include metformin and pioglitazone (when not contraindicated) in the drug treatment for type 2 diabetes; and 3. practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise in order to potentiate positive immunomodulation. Finally, present evidence suggests a prolongation of quarantine period in adult and adolescents obese patients.",
