The final row contained 5 \u00b5M the same non-labeled RNA 15-mer in order to confirm that the 6-FAM dye did not affect partitioning greatly. The degree of partitioning was calculated by dividing the absorbance at 495 nm of the RNA-enriched phase by the absorbance at 495 nm of the non-RNA-enriched phase. Absorbance was measured using a nanodrop spectrometer (Methods). Buffer conditions are identical to those mentioned in the captions for Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 . The ATP/pLys system as well as the DEAE-dextran/PEG system exhibited such a high degree of partitioning that the RNA concentration in the non-complex-enriched phase and the PEG-rich phase, respectively, were below the limit of detection of the nanodrop spectrometer used.
