The cat had been treated with systemic glucocorticoids for several months. Initial ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral deep stromal corneal ulcers, exudative panuveitis and secondary glaucoma. Mature mild neutrophilia and monocytosis were detected on complete blood cell count. Abnormalities in the serum profile were hyperglycemia, mild azotemia, hyperglobulinemia and moderate polyclonal gammapathy. Urinalysis revealed glucosuria without ketonuria. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed and treatment with long-acting insulin was started. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was highly positive for leishmaniasis, and treatment with allopurinol was started. Although specific topical treatment was applied, melting ulcers progressed to corneal perforation and both eyes were enucleated. Ocular histology showed large numbers of intracellular organisms compatible with amastigotes of the genus Leishmania located in the uveal tract, cornea, sclera and retina. Results of inmunohistochemistry staining on ocular samples were positive for Leishmania . Bone marrow cytology demonstrated numerous macrophages with intracytoplasmatic Leishmania. Polymerase chain reaction results on bone marrow for Leishmania were positive. Three weeks later, hypoglycemic episodes permitted withdrawal of the insulin therapy. To the authors' knowledge this is the first case of ocular and visceral leishmaniasis diagnosed in vivo and under systemic treatment in a cat.",

On ophthalmic examination, bilateral melting keratitis with deep stromal ulceration was present. Corneal cytology showed epithelial corneal cells and neutrophils, but no bacteria or parasites were observed. At this point, ELISA serum titers results were highly positive for leishmaniasis (300%; normal range < 40%), slightly positive for toxoplasmosis (1 : 50; reference range < 1 : 40) and FeCoV (1 : 340; reference range < 1 : 320), and negative for E. canis (1 : 20; reference range < 1 : 40) and FeLV/ FIV. Latex agglutination test was negative for C. neoformans. A presumptive diagnosis of feline leishmaniasis and DM was made. The cat was managed with allopurinol (10 mg / kg, PO, every 12 h; Zyloric, Faes Laboratories, Vizcaya, Spain); long-acting insulin (same dose), cephalexin (20 mg/ kg, intravenously, every 8 h; Kefloridina; Lilly Laboratories, Madrid, Spain); tobramycin (one drop, OU, every 1 h; Tobrex; Alcon Cus\u00ed); flurbiprofen (one drop, OU, every 8 h; Ocuflur, Allergan, Madrid, Spain); feline serum (one drop, OU, every 1 h) and atropine ointment (one application, OU, every 12 h; Oftalmolosa cusi atropine, Alcon Cus\u00ed). Melting keratitis progressed to corneal perforation OU within a few hours. At this point, corneal graft and conjunctival flap was recommended, but due to the poor ocular prognosis, the owner decided to have a bilateral enucleation performed. Two days after admission, bilateral enucleation and bone marrow aspiration from the iliac crest were performed. The cat was discharged 2 days after surgery with allopurinol (same dose), long-acting insulin (same dose), and enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg, PO, every 24 h, for 10 days; Baytril, Bayer).",

            "text": "Leishmaniasis is a worldwide infectious disease of people and wild and domestic animals caused by diphasic protozoans of the genus Leishmania . It is a frequent cause of clinical disease in dogs and less common in cats and humans. 1, 2 Natural leishmaniasis infection appears to be rare in the cat. Since 1911 about 50 cases of feline leishmaniasis have been reported. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The low prevalence of feline leishmaniasis in endemic areas could be due to under-reporting or natural feline resistance to infection. 8 However, in endemic areas there is a high possibility of infection. Visceral forms are not usually described in feline leishmaniasis, 5 although some case reports of cutaneous manifestations have been published. 4, 5 In some reports, feline leishmaniasis was related to natural acquired inmunodeficiency (FIV and FeLV infections), 1 although this association has not been confirmed. It is important to include leishmaniasis in the differential diagnosis of immunodeficient cats with systemic disease and polyclonal gammopathy. In our case, FIV and FeLV infection were ruled out, but as the patient was treated with glucocorticoids for 8 months, the immunological status may have been impaired. 9 Ocular manifestations are common in canine leishmaniasis, 10 but only two cases have been reported in cats. 6, 11 In dogs, anterior uveitis is the most ocular common finding and may have an immunologic basis. 10, 12, 13 Melting ulcers, although not frequent, are a complicating component of corneal ulcer. Corneal epithelial cells, fibroblasts, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, some bacterias and possibly fungi produce an abnormal amount of proteases and collagenases that contributed to the progressive breakdown and rapid 'melting' of the corneal stroma. 14 In this case, histopathology confirmed the presence of a large number of Leishmania amastigotes and leukocytes in the corneal stroma. Collagenases could have been produced directly by Leishmania amastigotes or by polymorphonuclear corneal cells, although synthesis of collagenases by L. infantum has not been proven. To the authors' knowledge this is the second description of panuveitis due to feline leishmaniasis, but it is the first with associated melting keratitis. In endemic areas, leishmaniasis should be included in differential diagnosis of feline uveitis and corneal melting ulcers.",

In the case reported here, serum Leishmania titer was positive and bone marrow cytology and PCR techniques demonstrated Leishmania parasites, confirming visceral involvement. L. infantum has been described in some reports as the etiological agent of feline leishmaniasis. 4, 7 Although Leishmania species could not be determined in this case, L. infantum was suspected, due to its endemicity in the Mediterranean basin 1, 13 Some previous studies suggest the role of cats as potential peridomestic reservoirs for L. infantum in northeastern Spain. 16 In this report, ocular leishmaniasis was diagnosed by means of immunohistochemistry on ocular tissues examined after bilateral enucleation.",

This type of DM has been associated with hyperadrenocorticism, hyperthyroidism, excessive growth hormone secretion, chronic progesterone administration or exocrine pancreatic tumors. 17 In this case, DM could be the result of administering high doses of long-acting glucocorticoids for several months. Insulin therapy and/or gradual tapering of glucocorticoid treatment allowed good control of blood glucose. Persistent hyperglycemia is an important factor in cats inducing glucose toxicity phenomena and inhibition of insulin synthesis or pancreatic secretion. 18 After starting insulin treatment and withdrawal of glucocorticoids, secretion of insulin is re-established and hypoglycemic crises can occur. In this case, hypoglycemia episodes occurred 2 months after the initiation of therapy, and insulin treatment was stopped without any further observed relapses.",
