However, in addition to influenza virus (FLU), respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), and parainflenza virus (PIV), an increasing number of newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63, HKU1, and human bocavirus (HBoV), have been recognized as possible viral pathogens in ARTI. Because these viruses are not routinely cultivated in clinical laboratories, molecular detection utilizing high throughput multiplex PCR assays has been developed and widely applied in the past decade [Freymuth et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007; Khamis et al., 2012]. Using molecular detection technologies, simultaneously detect a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses is feasible but awaits further validation to better understand their roles in diagnosing respiratory infections.",

The reduction in viral load after 3 days of hospitalization may be due to clinical improvement, and this may contribute to the reduced rate of viral detection by the xTAG RVP fast assay when sampling is delayed [Franz et al., 2010]. For optimal viral detection, it is recommended that samples be collected within 3\u20135 days of symptom onset.",

Therefore, the real rate of influenza infection would be underestimated. But we still detected 5.4% of flu A and 8.4% of flu B infection in this study, mostly among URI group. (2) The sampling time varied from the 1st to the 7th day following admission. The positive viral detection rate was then influenced by the progressive decline in viral load. This was ameliorated by testing the samples by both cell culture and molecular detection methods; (3) the period of study was not long enough to investigate seasonal variations, and the enrolled sample size was moderate to determine the impact of individual types of respiratory virus on clinical severity; (4) this study was conducted in a rural community\u2010based hospital, where the viral prevalence pattern has been shown to be different from that in urban pediatric populations [Gern et al., 2012]. Our finding of the viral distribution profile in LRTI group was similar to southern Taiwan, but different from northern Taiwan [Sung et al., 2011; Chou et al., 2014]. With respective of LRTI, RSV and EV/RV have the equal role in this study. In addition, this study population did not enroll critical or immunocompromised patients",

Picornavirses, RSV, and ADV were the most frequently detected viruses. Viral co\u2010infection was frequently observed, but was not associated with clinical disease severity. The introduction of molecular detection methods, if conducted early after admission, is beneficial for the early identification of the causative viral pathogens, even with co\u2010infections. Molecular respiratory viral diagnostic techniques have broadened the understanding of the etiological ARTI profile. Further study is warranted, focusing on the impact of introducing molecular diagnoses in reducing hospital stays and/or unnecessary antimicrobial use.",
