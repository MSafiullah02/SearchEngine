Lack of PPE and inadequate social distancing are the two modifiable risk factors that if addressed through the implementation of enforced physical distancing, increasing the availability of PPEs, and proper guidelines would significantly reduce transmission rates and help save lives. 4, 5 In March 2020, Italy reported over 2,600 HCWs were infected, devastating their already worn-down workforce. 6 Observing the wreckage ensuing across the globe, it is imperative to better prepare and care for our HCWs.",

Keeping our HCWs updated on the latest information diminishes the fear of uncertainty and negative emotions associated with the virus. 20 This entails frequent information sessions on the specific details of the virus, practicing ethical decision making, and how to effectively use hospital resources. 19 By ensuring that the entire team maintains the same understanding of information and protocols, a certain amount of order can be maintain to curtail the negative impacts of this crisis. Additionally, establishing break time will allow for HCWs time to take care of themselves. Another recommendation centers on creating healthcare staff reserves to relieve those on duty before exhaustion and strain sets in resulting in anxiety and depression, affecting the quality of healthcare delivery. This can be done in several ways, including incorporating outside registered nurses into the hospital system, re-employing HCWs who recently retired, and adding in the newly matched fourth year medical students. As this J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f crisis progresses it is imperative to continue to evaluate the well-being of our HCW and implement effect measures to care for their mental health.",
