            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) pose a serious threat to the world and are responsible for severe morbidity and mortality among human population globally. Seasonal outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics have been witnessed for IAVs and have resulted in immense loss to public health and economy (Wright and Neumann, 2013). The devastating potential of Influenza is shown by the facts that annually there are estimated 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and 300,000\u2013500,000 deaths around the globe (WHO, 2016). Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, characterized by segmented, negative-sense, single stranded RNA genome (Shaw and Palese, 2013). The family contains seven genera viz., Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Influenzavirus D, Isavirus, Quaranjavirus and Thogotovirus (ICTV, 2016). Out of the four genera of influenza viruses, influenza A and B are the main cause of seasonal epidemics while influenza C causes mild reparatory illness and influenza D affects cattle and not known to cause any infection in humans (Hause et al., 2014, CDC, 2016, Ferguson et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Influenza or \u201cFlu\u201d is a respiratory illness characterized by high grade fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, sore throat, rhinitis and cough (Cox and Subbarao, 1999). Generally influenza is a self limiting disease but may become life-threatening in high risk group individuals including young children, pregnant women, aged people and people with compromised immunity (Cox and Subbarao, 1999, Cox and Subbarao, 2000). Influenza vaccines are updated annually according to the circulating strains and this information is provided by the surveillance system of WHO\u2019s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) for both the northern and southern hemispheres (WHO, 2012, Webster and Govorkova, 2014). Antivirals treatment proved effective against influenza if given within 24\u201348 h of the onset of disease (Moscona, 2005). Hence, early and accurate diagnosis of influenza plays a crucial role for timely intervention of therapy, clinical management and thus controlling the spread of disease. Clinical symptoms of influenza and other respiratory infections can be very similar, making it hard to differentiate. Only laboratory diagnosis can provide an accurate influenza diagnosis. These include conventional virus isolation, antigen/antibody detection and molecular methods like reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Poddar, 2002) and real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) (Spackman and Suarez, 2008, Carr et al., 2009, Wang and Taubenberger, 2010). Virus isolation and serological assays are time consuming and take days to weeks to get results making them unsuitable during epidemics and also these methods require highly sophisticated biosafety laboratories. Molecular methods such as RT-PCR and rRT-PCR are although rapid, sensitive and specific but need costly equipments and trained laboratory persons making these assays hard to use in resource-limited laboratories of developing countries.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a specific, efficient and rapid technique that is similar to PCR amplification but the target DNA amplification is under isothermal conditions. This method makes use of a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize a total of six distinct sequences on the target DNA (Notomi et al., 2000). The method is applicable to amplification of RNA templates when combined with a reverse transcription reaction (RT-LAMP). RT-LAMP assay has been successfully applied for the detection of various RNA viruses including chikungunya (Parida et al., 2007, Lu et al., 2012), dengue (Lu et al., 2012, Parida et al., 2005), Japanese encephalitis (Parida et al., 2006, Toriniwa and Komiya, 2006), severe acute respiratory syndrome (Thai et al., 2004) and West Nile virus (Parida et al., 2004). Influenza viruses and their novel subtypes like H5, H7, H9 and H10, have been effectively detected by RT-LAMP assay (Poon et al., 2005, Ito et al., 2006, Imai et al., 2006, Chen et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2013, Luo et al., 2015). The specificity of RT-LAMP is extremely high due to use of four primers that recognize six distinct regions on the target DNA. It is faster than PCR because of single temperature is needed for amplification and also cost effective as costly equipments are not required. The amplification results can be viewed directly by using fluorescent dye like SYBR green, reducing the time of the assay.",

RT-LAMP demonstrated similar sensitivities as that of rRT-PCR for the detection of pdm09/H1N1 and H3N2 while 10 times less sensitivity for detection of H1N1 subtype (Table 3). Specificity of each RT-LAMP primer set was evaluated against different influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses. All the RT-LAMP primer sets were found to be highly specific for their respective influenza viruses as there was no amplification with other influenza viruses or different respiratory viruses.

Control of novel influenza A viruses mainly depends of early and accurate identification of virus strain followed by early intervention of antiviral therapy. So, a rapid, sensitive, specific and cost effective method of detection and subtyping of influenza A viruses is always seems fruitful in this scenario. Virus isolation using egg embryo culture or cell culture is considered as \u2018gold standard\u2019 for influenza virus detection but the whole process is labour intensive and lengthy taking 3\u20137 days for obtaining results (Ellis and Zambon, 2002). Serological methods are also not very reliable for influenza surveillance as these are time consuming and require analysis of serum samples from both acute phase and recovering phase. Rapid detection kit based assays are although fast but are not very consistent, have low sensitivity and may produce false results (Wang and Taubenberger, 2010, Ellis and Zambon, 2002, Kim and Poudel, 2013). Molecular detection methods have emerged as very useful tools in comparison to time consuming conventional virus isolation and serological methods. Molecular methods based on conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR have been proved useful in diagnosis and surveillance of influenza viruses, but most of these assays require highly sophisticated instruments and are not feasible to conduct in resource-limited settings of developing countries.",

We have used RT-LAMP assay, conventional RT-PCR and rRT-PCR assay in parallel reactions for diagnosis of influenza in clinical samples. Real-time RT-PCR reaction was performed using WHO recommended primers (WHO, 2014) and was used as standard to compare RT-LAMP and conventional RT-PCR assay. Real-time RT-PCR detected 32 samples positive for influenza A viruses, which on further subtyping showed 2, 7 and 23 samples for influenza H1N1, H3N2 and pdm09/H1N1 respectively. Sensitivity of conventional RT-PCR for detection of influenza A viruses and subtype pdm09/H1N1 was 84.4% (27/32) and 86.9% (20/23) respectively. Whereas RT-LAMP assay showed sensitivity of 93.8% (30/32) for influenza A viruses and 91.3% (21/23) for subtype pdm09/H1N1 detection, indicating higher sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR. Both these assays detected H3 subtype with equal sensitivity of 100% (7/7). For seasonal H1 subtype, sensitivity and specificity could not be determined due to small number of positive samples. The results showed that RT-LAMP assay can be applied successfully for the diagnostic and surveillance studies of influenza viruses.",

So RT-LAMP assay gave efficient results within one and a half hours of sample processing (RNA extraction) making this assay fast when compared with conventional RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR which gave results within 2\u20133 h (Gu et al., 2010). Previous studies have reported that by using two accessory loop primers the amplification time can be reduced from 60 min to 30\u201340 min (Luo et al., 2015, Kubo et al., 2010, Gu et al., 2010, Imai et al., 2007, Peng et al., 2011). For the sake of simplicity and making our reaction more cost effective we stuck to the basic protocol of RT-LAMP assay and use only four primers for amplification which didn\u2019t compromise with sensitivity of the assay. RT-LAMP assay can be modified to detect samples in real-time by using turbidity measurement by turbidimeter as turbidity of reaction increases due to release of pyrophosphates during amplification. Moreover, addition of a florescent dye like calcein or SYBR green in the reaction can be used for direct visualization of the amplification products under UV light thus eliminating the need of gel electrophoresis making the reaction more rapid and less prone to cross-contaminations (Luo et al., 2015, Kubo et al., 2010, Bao et al., 2012, Gu et al., 2010, Peng et al., 2011) .We used SYBR green I dye (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for direct visualization under UV light and both visual detection and agarose gel electrophoresis produced similar results. This showed that RT-LAMP assay can be applied as a point-of-care test during influenza outbreaks due to its simplicity, high sensitivity and less turn-around time.",

The results of the study clearly showed that RT-LAMP assay can be applied successfully to the clinical samples and the results were compatible with that of the WHO\u2019s recommended real-time RT-PCR. The RT-LAMP assay is a simple, rapid, specific, sensitive and cost effective method for detection and subtyping of influenza A viruses and may prove useful in the resource-poor laboratories of the developing countries during influenza outbreaks.",
