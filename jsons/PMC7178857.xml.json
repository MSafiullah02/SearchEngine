As the bone marrow is replaced with malignant cells, myeloid and lymphoid cell production fall, and those available have weakened responses to pathogens. Peripheral leukocytes in patients with acute leukemia have impaired phagocytosis [7, 8] which can lead to increased risk of bacterial and fungal infections, while chronic leukemias demonstrate reduced immunoglobulin production [9, 10]. Due to these immune deficits, it is not uncommon for infections to be a primary reason for patients to seek care, and uncontrolled or uncommon infections are known to portend an undiagnosed hematologic malignancy [11].",

Protracted periods of agranulocytosis and delayed recovery of adaptive immunity are more common following aggressive therapy for relapsed disease and/or conditioning prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) [12\u201314]. Furthermore, alterations in normal gut flora [15], destruction of mucosal barriers [16, 17], transfusion-associated iron overload [18], and loss of skin integrity further increase the risk of infection. All told, the multiple negative effects of therapy further compromise the immune response, placing these patients at added risk for severe and life-threatening infections.",

Novel laboratory techniques, such as molecular diagnostics for viral infections [23], have also allowed for earlier detection of major infections [24]. Hematologic support through the use of colony-stimulating factors has helped to shorten neutropenia and further limit infectious complications [25]. However, even as diagnostic and therapeutic options have evolved, novel treatment options for leukemia, biologic immune-modulating therapies, expanded transplant protocols for high-risk patients, and alternate stem cell donor sources have led to additional immune dysfunction and infectious risk. Not surprisingly, prevention regimens have also led to the emergence of drug-\u00adresistant pathogens [26\u201330], many of which are associated with increased infection-related mortality.",

In addition, when addressing this topic, there is a large variation on the strength of clinical evidence in the literature. Randomized clinical trials evaluating treatment and prevention of infections, for example, are the strongest for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and fungal infections, but the majority of data are based either on retrospective clinical studies or on expert opinion. In this overview, we do not address the strength of evidence and instead refer you to more comprehensive guidelines and reviews whenever possible throughout the chapter [31, 32].

Due to bacterial translocation during episodes of severe mucositis and gut GVHD, enteric GNRs and gram-positive clostridial species are more frequent. In particular, C. perfringens bacteremia can lead to severe life-threatening intravascular hemolysis [77], and C. septicum bacteremia is associated with gastrointestinal complications [78].",

Antibiotic therapy for any bloodstream infections should be based on culture and sensitivity testing, and patients should have repeat cultures to assure that the organism has cleared. Most bacterial infections require at least 2 weeks of IV therapy, but some pathogens (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes) may need more prolonged courses. Patients with NTM should be treated for at least 3 months with a combination of at least 2\u20133 agents [55].

All patients with candidemia should undergo an ophthalmologic evaluation. Recommendations regarding the management of Candida infections are reviewed in reference by Pappas et al. [92].

Gram-negative and gram-\u00adpositive organisms can get into the CNS and lead to meningitis during treatment, and although rare, resistant bacteria may be more common due to prior antibiotic exposure. Community-acquired meningitis caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae is infrequent, but due to alterations in humoral immunity, emerging microbial resistance and a move to more outpatient care can occur late posttransplant and during periods of treatment for GHVD [100, 101]. Rothia mucilaginosa, a gram-positive organism that is a commensal organism in oral flora, is associated with a rare, but severe, meningitis that occurs almost exclusively during periods of severe mucositis [102]. Central line\u2013associated bacteremia rarely leads to ophthalmic infection causing sight-threatening endophthalmitis or brain involvement [103, 104], and even less frequently, bacteria can gain access through intracranial interventions such as Ommaya port placement [105].",

Nearly 50% of immunocompromised patients who develop listeriosis develop CNS disease [107], which can present as acute cerebritis or brain abscesses (Fig. 12.2). Nocardia species are filamentous bacteria that usually lead to pulmonary infections, of which over 30% develop CNS lesions; most commonly single or multiple abscesses.

Mould infections primarily lead to space-occupying lesions, but can also present as cerebral infarctions or meningitis [111, 112]. Retrospective reviews of brain abscesses in transplant patients suggest that Aspergillus is the most common cause [99, 113, 114] and that fungal etiologies make up close to 90% of episodes [113, 114]. While Aspergillus may be the most common fungus, CNS infection can also be caused by other opportunistic moulds such as the Mucorales (zygomyces) species [115, 116] and Scedosporium [117]. Rhinocerebral involvement and cavernous sinus involvement are unique \u00adpresentations nearly always associated with the Mucorales [118].

During the early posttransplant period, HHV-6 is the most common viral cause of CNS infection [94, 124]. HHV-6 reactivation usually occurs between 2 and 4 weeks posttransplant, and symptoms can range from mild delirium and cognitive dysfunction to seizures and encephalitis [125]. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is another neurotropic virus primarily associated with encephalitis, though vasculopathy can also be associated with CNS involvement [126]. Interestingly, although VZV reactivation usually presents with prominent skin involvement (herpes zoster), patients with CNS disease may present without rash [127, 128]. Herpes simplex (HSV) encephalitis can also occur in leukemia and transplant recipients, though patients are more likely to present with personality changes and focal abnormalities [129]. Additionally, both HSV and VZV can present with involvement in the otic branch presenting with unilateral facial paralysis, ear pain, and vesicles in the auditory canal and auricle (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) [130, 131]. CNS involvement of both VZV and HSV usually occurs only after the discontinuation of prophylactic acyclovir; such prophylaxis has not been shown to prevent HHV-6. Other latent herpesvirus infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [132] and cytomegalovirus (CMV) [133, 134], can also cause CNS disease and, in EBV\u2019s case, can be associated with both encephalitis and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) [37, 135].",

Specific radiologic manifestations of certain infections, such as herpes simplex (temporal lobe involvement), HHV-6 (mesial temporal lobes, limbic encephalitis) [148], and JC virus (single or multifocal white matter lesions without mass effect) [149], can be suggestive of the underlying diagnosis. These patients may also present with atypical findings on imaging. Toxoplasmosis for example, may not present with classic ring-enhancing lesions [150, 151]. Additionally, imaging can suggest other noninfectious etiologies which can lead to CNS symptoms.

Serologic tests can be beneficial in patients who are considered to be at risk for endemic mycoses or parasitic disease, and blood cultures can provide additional data for potential bacterial and fungal processes. Patients with symptoms at other locations (e.g., cough) should undergo additional imaging to help complete a diagnostic work-up. Other data to rule out other noninfectious etiologies should also be considered, such as drug levels to assess for CNS drug toxicity and CSF cytologic review and flow cytometry to assess for CNS involvement of leukemia if appropriate.

Bacterial infections need aggressive IV therapy with duration dependent on the diagnosis (see Table 12.1). Dual therapy for CNS Nocardia species infections should be considered initially (e.g., trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and imipenem) and long-term therapy based on sensitivity testing once available. Length of therapy is dependent on CT resolution, but most feel that at least a year of therapy is needed [153]. Usual antimicrobial coverage for bacterial meningitis (vancomycin, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides) will not treat Listeria monocytogenes. All immunosuppressed patients with presumed meningitis should have IV ampicillin added to the underlying empiric regimen. Patients with proven listeriosis require prolonged IV ampicillin therapy. Aspergillus CNS infections should be guided by sensitivity testing when possible, but usual treatment includes either voriconazole or lipid amphotericin B formulations; treatment guidelines are reviewed by Walsh et al. [154]. Voriconazole, in particular, is known to get excellent CNS penetration [155, 156]. Patients with CNS infection with any of the Mucorales species should be treated with either lipid amphotericin B formulations or posaconazole, but overall outcomes are poor [116]. Endemic fungal CNS infections\u2019 treatment options are reviewed in references by Wheat et al. [119], Galgiani et al. [120], and Perfect et al. [109]. HSV and VZV CNS infections require high-dose IV acyclovir, and patients with HHV-6 encephalitis should receive either IV foscarnet or IV ganciclovir [157]. Patients with toxoplasmosis should receive intensive therapy with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid or high-dose trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [158].",

Patients with prolonged neutropenia or undergoing salvage chemotherapy are not surprisingly at higher risk for developing this complication. There are a wide variety of gram-positive and GNR species that can lead to pneumonia in this immunocompromised population, but providers should be aware of specific bacterial pathogens that are more specific to these patients. The gram-positive filamentous bacteria Nocardia is an opportunistic infection that after inhalation can develop into pulmonary disease. Nocardia are usually resistant to standard antimicrobial prophylaxis regimens, are more frequent in patients not on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis [164] and those receiving steroids [165]. Nocardia species can have varied presentations in transplantation, but most frequently appear as nodular pulmonary disease; some patients may have asymptomatic nodules found only on imaging (Fig. 12.3) [165]. Legionella species can also occur in posttransplant recipients, though nonpneumophila species, particularly L. micdadei, are more frequent [166\u2013168]. Legionella species can present with lung nodules, mimicking fungal infections, or as pulmonary infiltrates. Mycoplasma and other atypical organisms are rare [169, 170]. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) is the most frequently isolated mycobacteria from pulmonary specimens in HCT patients, but since many have colonization, not all warrant treatment [55].\n",

Aspergillus species are the most common cause of fungal sinusitis [171, 172], but less frequent fungal organisms, such as Scopulariopsis [173] and Paecilomyces [174], among others, can also lead to sinus disease.

Risk factors for the development of CMV pneumonia include: lymphopenia, GVHD, and high-dose steroids, among others [194]. Patients who undergo umbilical cord blood transplant or T-cell depletion are at significantly higher risk [195, 196]. Early CMV pneumonia/pneumonitis is seen within the first 3 months posttransplantation during the period of greatest immunosuppression. Late CMV disease occurs more than 3 months after HSCT, and likely as a result of residual deficits in cell-mediated immunity [194, 197, 198]. HSV, VZV, and other herpesviruses can also rarely lead to pulmonary complications in patients [199]. EBV-associated posttransplant related lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) can manifest in the lungs as pulmonary nodules [200].

These viruses can cause a spectrum of disease, including upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, and/or even late airflow obstruction [206], and are a cause of significant morbidity and mortality [205]. Influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, and RSV can all be associated with both upper and severe lower tract disease. Influenza viruses and RSV are seasonal, while parainfluenza can occur year round. Community-acquired adenovirus can also be associated with high rates of mortality when associated with lower tract disease [207]. Rhinovirus and coronavirus are the most common respiratory viral infections, often limited to only upper respiratory disease [204]. They have been rarely associated with pulmonary complications in transplant recipients [208].

Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can opacify sinus spaces on plain film or CT, but more invasive findings, such as bony erosion, suggest fungal sinusitis. Bacterial infections typically present as lobar consolidations or infiltrates. Fungal infections typically present on CT as solitary or multiple pulmonary nodules, and a classic \u201chalo sign\u201d on CT is very suggestive of an underlying fungal nodule (Fig. 12.4) [210, 211]. Lobar consolidation and cavitary disease are less frequent CT presentations [210]. International criteria for the diagnosis of fungal infections, which include radiologic findings, can help providers determine which patients should receive antifungal therapy [212]. Lower tract viral infections primarily present with diffuse interstitial disease or ground-glass infiltrates; other infections such as PCP can have a similar appearance. Pulmonary consolidation [213] and nodular disease [214] have also been described for viral infections (e.g., CMV, HMPV). Since multiple pathogens can occur in a single patient, radiologic findings are only suggestive and need confirmatory testing.\n",

Additionally, this modality may help to evaluate other nonfungal infections, separate specific pathogens from each other, detect coinfections, and provide samples for antimicrobial resistance testing. While PCR-based strategies for specific fungal pathogens are still under development, PCR-based respiratory testing for viral pathogens from BAL samples is becoming standard at many centers [209, 220]. PCP is classically diagnosed from induced sputum samples in other immunocompromised populations (e.g., HIV); however, bronchoscopy may enhance diagnosis in transplant recipients due to the low burden of disease [223, 224].

Patients should typically undergo therapy until pulmonary nodules have completely resolved or stabilized for 2\u20133 months of immunosuppressive therapy. Patients with Mucorales pulmonary infections should be treated with either lipid amphotericin B formulations or posaconazole; when possible, sensitivity testing can help tailor therapy. Cardiothoracic surgery consultation should be considered in patients failing therapy and can be considered as adjunctive treatment for patients with solitary fungal nodules. Treatment of less frequent fungal infections (e.g., Scedosporium species) should be based on sensitivity testing.

Treatment options for patients with influenza are reviewed by Casper [230] but usually include oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir as primary therapy. Alternate combination therapy can be considered in patients with life-threatening infections [230], particularly since the development of resistance can occur during therapy [29]. RSV is responsive to aerosolized ribavirin, which has been shown to reduce mortality from lower tract disease [231]. Survival may be improved when aerosolized ribavirin is used in combination therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin or palivizumab [29, 205]. Few options exist for treatment of other viral respiratory pathogens, so although no randomized data exist, oral or inhaled ribavirin can be considered in patients with parainfluenza [232] or metapneumovirus [233].",

Septic thrombophlebitis typically involves the development of bacteremia or fungemia that infects a preexisting thrombus, typically at sites of line placement. Candida species are commonly associated with this phenomenon, but any bacteria can lead to this complication [234]. Endocarditis in this population is an uncommon outcome following transplantation. These cases are often due to Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, or Enterococcal species, but other rare GNRs and atypical organisms have occasionally been reported [235, 236]; nearly all cases involve the right side of the heart unless patients have known underlying valvular pathology [235]. Candida or other fungal endocarditis is rare but associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality [237\u2013239]. Interestingly, noninfectious etiologies of endocardial masses (thrombi or marantic changes) can lead to similar symptoms in this population [236, 240]. Invasive fungal infections of the myocardium can also occur, but most are associated with primary pulmonary involvement or dissemination [241, 242]. Rare bacterial and fungal processes can lead to purulent pericarditis [243, 244].",

Most community-acquired bacterial causes for diarrhea, such as Salmonella and Shigella, occur only sporadically due to limited oral intake, less frequent exposure, and to standard prophylactic antibiotic therapy [255]. A more frequent infectious etiology for diarrhea is Clostridium difficile infection. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and prolonged exposure to inpatient care increase the risk for C. difficile. Usually C. difficile\u2013associated diarrhea occurs within the first 30\u201340 days posttransplant [253, 256], but patients are at risk through the transplant process. Episodes of C. difficile that occur during neutropenia can develop into life-threatening disease [257].",

Patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis acquire the disease during periods of neutropenia but may develop fever, right upper quadrant pain, and increasing liver function tests only after neutrophil recovery [262].

Routine bacterial cultures and parasite examinations are rarely useful as these pathogens are uncommon [286]. Samples however should routinely be sent for C. difficile testing regardless of prior antibiotic exposure. Elevated liver transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, and rising bilirubin, can also suggest potential etiologies [294]. Viral testing including adenovirus PCR, norovirus PCR, and rotavirus EIA from stool can be considered for patients. All patients with known HBV exposure should have a HBV PCR at baseline, and if they develop severe transaminitis, have it repeated. Additionally, although CMV, EBV, and adenovirus PCRs from serum can suggest an underlying diagnosis, VZV and HSV PCRs from serum/plasma in the face of symptoms consistent with visceral zoster or acute hepatitis are of critical importance for diagnosis. Serum GM can be sent in patients who are felt to be at risk for gut-related Aspergillus but may be falsely positive in patients with severe mucosal breakdown or in those receiving piperacillin-tazobactam therapy [295, 296]. All patients receiving intensive chemotherapy should have baseline serologic testing for viral hepatitis.",

Hepatosplenic candidiasis, for example, presents with multiple hypodense \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d lesions in the liver and spleen which are indicative of Candida abscesses within the liver [294]. Neutropenic enterocolitis typically demonstrates inflammation and stranding around the cecum (Fig. 12.5). Unfortunately, GI mould infections may be difficult to diagnose from imaging [264], with many diagnosed following death (Fig. 12.6). Intervention may also be important in the work-up of patient\u2019s symptoms. In patients at risk for GVHD, gastroenterology consultation is suggested to evaluate by endoscopy. Endoscopic visualization and biopsies can help differentiate between viral infections (CMV and adenovirus) and GVHD and may detect other infectious lesions [297]. It is important to stress that more than one diagnostic method for CMV detection is needed in the GI tract [298] and that CMV PCR still needs to be validated as a diagnostic entity for the diagnosis. Surgical intervention or liver biopsy may be necessary particularly in patients without a clear diagnosis or if CT findings are suspicious for a fungal process. Patients with severe neutropenic enterocolitis or those with severe abdominal pain may need emergent surgical consultation [258].\n",

Rarely, BK can lead to nephritis in HCT recipients [319]. Interestingly, the immune response to BK may play an important role in the development of BK-associated symptoms [320]. Adenovirus also leads to HC [320, 321] but is a more common cause of nephritis than BK [322]. Unlike BK virus, risk factors for the development of invasive adenovirus include major changes in immune function, including T-cell depletion [202\n320].

C. jeikeium often presents with an erythematous papular eruption during episodes of bacteremia [332]. Nocardia and other uncommon organisms have also led to cutaneous manifestations in this population [333, 334]. Gangrenous or necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening skin infection and is characterized by necrosis of the deeper \u00adsubcutaneous fat and fascia. Patients typically present with signs of overwhelming infection, and rates of mortality are very high [335]. In leukemia, necrotizing fasciitis can be either a polymicrobial process or caused by singular primarily GNR species [335]. Patients may present with bacteremia and minimal skin findings which may progress rapidly to a more fulminant course [336]. Clues to this diagnosis include a rapidly expanding cellulitis, black/dusky areas of involvement, pain out of proportion to the cutaneous findings, and laboratory alterations such as an elevated creatinine and lactic acidosis. Surgical consultation and immediate debridement of the affected area are mandatory. A specific form of necrotizing fasciitis that involves the perineum, Fournier\u2019s gangrene, can be particularly morbid [337].",

With the standard use of acyclovir, prophylaxis episodes of HSV during transplant and leukemia therapy are less frequent, although acyclovir-resistant cases can occasionally occur, especially in low-dose regimens [38]. Similar to HSV, VZV can present as herpes zoster or disseminated disease. Typical dermatomal reactivations occur late after transplant, but during active chemotherapy and postconditioning, patients are at risk for dissemination which can have an appearance not unlike primary Varicella (chickenpox) [343]. Erythematous rashes can be seen in other viral infections [344].",

Fever can be caused by numerous etiologies, and only about 20\u201330% of patients have documented infections during a neutropenic evaluation [39]. However, due to the high risk for morbidity and mortality associated with infections, most providers give standard prophylaxis during this period of risk. There are numerous risk categories that are reviewed in detail by Freifeld et al. and prevention strategies differ slightly between groups [39]. Patients receiving therapy for leukemia and transplant recipients are expected to have prolonged periods of neutropenia (>7\u201310 days) so are considered to be higher risk. Most centers and guidelines recommend the use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in this population, and this appears to be as effective as IV ceftazidime [31, 57]. Due to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. viridans (particularly ciprofloxacin) [346], some centers add additional penicillin VK or amoxicillin to fluoroquinolones [347, 348] and others early vancomycin in patients at high risk for this organism [349]. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can be considered in patients who have an allergy to fluoroquinolones but is often not possible in patients with neutropenia [32]. Prophylaxis should be stopped after neutrophil recovery. Late strategies to prevent posttransplant S. pneumoniae and encapsulated bacteria in patients with chronic GVHD should be based on local resistance patterns [31].",

Not all patients with detectable CMV will progress to disease, so centers need to develop viral load thresholds for PCR and antigenemia that will maximize effect and minimize toxicity.

Numerous testing strategies have been advocated, including whole blood, PBMCs, or cell-free plasma. In general, all of these specimens provide good sensitivity, although comparisons suggest that cell-free plasma may provide superior specificity for PTLD [367]. Most authors favor a preemptive therapy similar to what is seen in CMV, in which detection of EBV DNA levels above a certain threshold triggers a reduction in immunosuppression or rituximab therapy [368, 369]. There are no current guidelines for a threshold for EBV viremia due to variances in testing and in transplant populations [31]. Other groups use \u201cprompt\u201d therapy in which treatment is triggered only when detection of EBV DNA is accompanied by overt signs of EBV disease. Prompt therapy has shown similar efficacy to preemptive therapy [370]. Based on the concern that the delay in treatment may lead to increased complications, many groups still favor preemptive approaches [31, 301]. T-cell immunotherapeutic regimens are still experimental and not widely available.",

The X axis indicates the approximate CMV PCR level in serum (log10 copies per mL), which is indicated by the thick solid line. The thin solid line indicates the typical level of PCR detection. The Y axis represents days pre- or posttransplant. Primary prophylaxis (large dark-gray arrow), with drugs such as ganciclovir (IV or oral), is usually given after the point at which patients engraft. Many centers use an antigenemia-based preemptive testing (pp65) strategy (large medium-gray arrow). This can be started earlier and has been shown to prevent CMV disease. PCR-based preemptive therapy (large white arrow) is the standard at many other centers, including our own, and allows for testing to begin immediately after conditioning. Small white arrows indicate weekly testing by PCR that we do at our center through at least day 100. Small gray arrows indicated weekly antigenemia testing that typically starts near engraftment",
