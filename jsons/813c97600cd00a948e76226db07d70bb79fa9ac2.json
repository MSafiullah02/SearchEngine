Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from 60 infants who were diagnosed with bronchiolitis within 96 hr of wheezing onset upon admission and on days 3, 5, and 7 in the hospital, and 17 respiratory viruses were detected. The RSV load was quantified by real-time qPCR for RSV subtypes A and B at different time points. Scoring criteria were used to evaluate the degree of severity. A total of 40 infants were determined to be RSV-positive, nine were identified as RSV subtype A (RSVA), and 31 were RSV subtype B (RSVB). The peak RSV load was observed upon admission, and the RSV load decreased significantly over time; in addition, this decrease began to have significant differences on day 5. There was a positive correlation between the RSV load and the clinical score (r 2 \u00bc 0.121 and P < 0.001). According to the clinical scores, the infants in the severe group tended to have higher RSV loads than those in the moderate and mild groups. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that the viral load on day 3 was independently associated with the degree of severity. This study elucidated that a higher mean RSV load was associated with a more severe disease and a longer duration of hospitalization and symptoms. This study also clarified RSV replication in infants and provides a theoretical basis for specifying an anti-RSV therapy strategy.",

It is generally characterized by acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells lining small airways, leading to rhinorrhea, cough, wheezing, hyperexpansion of the lungs, hypoxia, and respiratory distress [Panitch, 2003; Pavia, 2011] . RSV is the most common etiological agent of bronchiolitis. It was estimated that 66,000-199,000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated acute respiratory tract infection in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries [Nair et al., 2010] . In the UK, the RSV-attributed death rate in infants has been estimated to be 8.4 per 100,000 [Fleming et al., 2005] . The incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year. At present, there is no special medicine for the treatment of bronchiolitis. It has been reported that approximately 1% of infants with bronchiolitis need to go to the hospital for treatment and that 10% of them require treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) [Nagakumar and Doull, 2012] .",

Higher RSV loads predict disease severity in infants who were previously healthy correlating with longer durations of hospitalization El Saleeby et al., 2011] . Recent studies also report that disease severity is positively correlated with the viral load during primary RSV infection [Houben et al., 2010] . Some reports have investigated the relationship between RSV viral dynamics and disease severity. In their study, the viral loads on day 3 were associated more significantly with a requirement for intensive care and respiratory failure than the viral loads at earlier time points. Faster RSV clearance was independently associated with shorter hospitalization [El Saleeby et al., 2011] . Clinical improvement was associated with a reduction of viral quantity after three days of hospitalization [Jansen et al., 2010] . However, the relationship between changes in the RSV load dynamics and the disease severity of RSV-infected infants has not been studied in detail. Understanding the relationship between the clinical severity of bronchiolitis and the dynamic RSV load will aid the risk factor assessment of clinical severity and help the development of timely intervention therapy. It will thus provide a conceptual background for understanding the disease pathogenesis of RSV and other respiratory virus infections.",

The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is according to the Zhu Futang textbook of Pediatrics [Zhang, 2002] . Bronchiolitis was diagnosed from the presence of a history of upper respiratory tract infection followed by acute onset of respiratory distress with cough, tachypnea, retraction, wheezing, and diffuse crackles on auscultation. Patients were excluded if they had received antiviral (ribavirin) and immunomodulatory agents (prednisone or hydrocortisone) in the preceding two weeks. Children with wheezing, breathlessness, and obstruction of the airways, in whom similar episodes had previously been diagnosed and treated by a physician, were diagnosed as recurrent wheezing and were excluded. Qualified pediatricians identified bronchiolitis and its clinical severity and collected clinical information confidentially. The demographic data and clinical history were collected from guardians via interviews. This study was approved by the Ethics and Research Council of Chongqing Children's Hospital, and signed consent was obtained from each child's parents or foster parents.",

A disposable controllable suction tube with the negative pressure method was used to collect the nasopharyngeal aspirates through the following operation: a syringe was connected to the plastic disposable sputum suction tube; the sputum tube was placed carefully and gently into the nasopharynx of patients; the saline injection was gently pushed; the disposable controllable suction tube, which is connected to the negative pressure device, can then be used to suck as much as possible of the nasopharynx secretion; and each specimen was diluted with 2 ml of physiological saline. The specimens were maintained at 4\u02daC for a maximum of 4 hr and then stored at \u00c080\u02daC until further processing. The viral DNA and RNA were extracted from 200 ml aliquots of the nasopharyngeal aspirates samples using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was applied as the template for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA and RNA extractions and cDNA products were used for the subsequent testing of 17 respiratory viruses. The 17 respiratory viruses were detected as follows [Coiras et al., 2003; Coiras et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2006; Granados et al., 2012] : nested PCR assays were used to detect human RSVA, RSVB, IVA, IVB, IVC, CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, hMPV, PIV 1-4, and AdV.

The sequence of the N gene for the RSV A2 strain (GenBank accession number M11486) and that for the RSV B strain (GenBank accession number D00736) were used for the design of the primers and probes. The plasmidamplified target fragment was cloned into the pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) and verified by sequencing. The plasmid DNA concentrations were detected with an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop). Real-time qPCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 20 ml consisting of 10 ml of TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.6 ml (10 mM) of each primer, 0.6 ml (10 mM) of the probe, 2 ml of template and 6.2 ml of double-distilled water. The real-time qPCR thermal cycling reaction and quantitative measurement were performed in a 96-well format in a StepOne Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems) using the following conditions: one cycle at 50\u02daC for 2 min, one cycle at 95\u02daC for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95\u02daC for 15 sec, and one cycle at 60\u02daC for 1 min. Strict laboratory procedures were followed to prevent PCR contamination, including separate spaces for sample handling, the Master Mix ingredients, and the plasmid templates. All of the runs included negative controls and plasmid in each PCR assay. Representative results from the real-time qPCR quantification were found for the serial dilutions of RSVA and RSVB plasmids (10 1 -10 7 copies/reaction) with the baseline-corrected fluorescence plotted against the cycle number. The standard curves were positioned within each plate, and each run was performed in duplicate. For standard curves of five independent runs, the mean correlation coefficient of RSVA was 0.996 with a standard deviation of 0.004, and the mean value of the slope was \u00c03.53 with a standard deviation of 0.04. The mean correlation coefficient of RSVB was 0.998 with a standard deviation of 0.02, and the mean value of the slope was \u00c03.56 with a standard deviation of 0.17. The standard curves are shown in Figure 1 . The RSV load values are expressed as log 10 copy number of RSV-RNA/ml in nasopharyngeal aspirates.",

            "text": "The viral loads may vary by RSV subtypes and affect the clinical severity. The predominant RSV subtype shifts from year to year [Zhang et al., 2010; Ren et al., 2014] , and the immunity against the previous circulating subtype could have altered the disease severity caused by specific subtypes. Infection with RSVA has been shown in several studies to produce more severe disease than RSVB [Papadopoulos et al., 2004; Tran et al., 2013] . In this study, there were nine infants with RSVA, and no significant differences were observed in the viral load and clinical severity between the infants with RSVA and those with RSVB. Few studies have demonstrated no significant differences in clinical severity between RSV subtypes [Devincenzo, 2004; Fodha et al., 2007; Jafri et al., 2013] . However, some studies have indicated that RSVA results in more severe disease than RSVB [Mansbach et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2013] .In this study, the co-detection of RSV with other viruses did not add disease severity compared with the single detection of RSV. This observation is consistent with previous studies [Brand et al., 2012] . However, some studies have reported that RSV codetected with some viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and human Bocavirus, can induce much more severe disease [Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Semple et al., 2005; Midulla et al., 2009] . The rate of RSV clearance in infants with RSV co-detected with other viruses was not different from that found in infants with only RSV. This finding adds to our knowledge in this field.In addition, this study has certain limitations: it was limited by a small sample size and by the analysis of only two RSV epidemic seasons. Studies with larger samples and covering a larger time period are needed to support our findings. The dynamic RSV load was associated with the clinical severity of bronchiolitis in hospitalized infants. A higher mean RSV load lead to a higher mean clinical score and more disease severe with longer durations of hospitalization and symptoms. These findings may give rise to infants' being infected with a high RSV load and particularly severe disease.",
