In particular, primary care providers should be familiar with destination-specific disease risks, be knowledgeable in pre-travel health advice in order to reduce the risks for travelers, be prepared to prescribe and recommend medications for treatment that can be taken during the trip, and be able to identify those who might need additional follow-up after the trip [3]. Among healthcare professionals, pharmacists potentially have an important role in travel medicine within the community, and they are able to provide useful insights. In Italy, community pharmacists have a primary role also in providing recommendations to patients on the use of the healthcare services, and they can sell over-the-counter drugs to the public without medical counseling. Indeed, pharmacists can be one of the most common sources of healthcare information as they are closer to home and individuals often seek their services directly without consulting traveler medical centers. Therefore, pharmacists should be highly educated about travel medicine, since they could influence their own choices and those of the individuals they encounter. ",

The second part consisted of questions related to the pharmacists\u2019 knowledge about infectious diseases related to travel. Fourteen main infectious diseases selected according to the most frequently visited countries by the Italian population [5,18,19,20,21] were listed and pharmacists had to self-evaluate their knowledge giving their answers by choosing one of the three options: \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, or \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d. The scale was then dichotomized (\u201cYes\u201d = 1 and \u201cNo\u201d/\u201dDon\u2019t know\u201d = 0) and the total knowledge score for each participant was computed by adding up the scores (maximum score of 14). The total score was then categorized as poor knowledge (score of \u22642), moderate knowledge (score of 3\u20134), and good knowledge (score \u22655). The third part assessed participants\u2019 attitudes with three statements on the importance of travel medicine for their work activity, asking whether they agreed that travel medicine is a pharmacist competency and whether they should give advice regarding travel medicine as part of their work activity, with response options on a 5-level Likert scale ranging from \u201cStrongly disagree\u201d to \u201cStrongly agree\u201d, and whether they believed that it is important to provide information to the public about travel medicine, with the response on a numerical 10-point Likert scale with higher values corresponding to a stronger attitude. The fourth part collected information about their practice and communication with the public regarding travel medicine. Three responses were collected on a 5-level Likert scale ranging from \u201cNever\u201d to \u201cAlways\u201d and the others through multiple-choice alternatives. The fifth part included two questions on whether respondents had received information about travel medicine and whether they had educational needs. ",

First, descriptive analyses were performed to assess all characteristics of the participants. Second, chi-square and Student\u2019s t-test were conducted to examine the relationship between the independent variables and the outcomes of interest. Third, multivariate ordered, linear, and logistic regression analysis was conducted by including in the models the variables with a p-value \u2264 0.25 at the bivariate analysis in order to estimate the independent association between potential predictors and the outcomes of interest. The following three models were developed: (1) pharmacists\u2019 level of knowledge about the more frequent infectious diseases related to travel (poor = 1; moderate = 2; good = 3) (Model 1); (2) pharmacists who believed that it is important to provide information to the public about travel medicine (continuous) (Model 2); (3) pharmacists who often or always inform the public about the importance of having travel health center counseling (no = 0; yes = 1) (Model 3). Initial candidate variables included in all models were age (continuous), gender (male = 0; female = 1), marital status (unmarried/separated/divorced/widowed = 0; married = 1), number of years since degree (continuous), number of years in practice (continuous), number of hours worked per week (continuous), employment type (owner = 1; employee = 2; director = 3), having heard about travel medicine (no = 0; yes = 1), sources of information on travel medicine (none = 1; scientific journals and educational activities = 2; Internet and mass media = 3), and need of additional information on travel medicine (no = 0; yes = 1). Moreover, the following variables were also included: pharmacists\u2019 level of knowledge about the more frequent infectious diseases related to travel (poor = 1; moderate = 2; good = 3), pharmacists who believed that travel medicine is a pharmacist competency (strongly disagree/disagree/uncertain = 0; agree/strongly agree = 1), pharmacists who believed that they could give advice to the public about travel medicine (strongly disagree/disagree/uncertain = 0; agree/strongly agree = 1) in Models 2 and 3, and pharmacists who believed that it is important to provide information to the public about travel medicine (continuous) in Model 3. A stepwise backward procedure was used to select which variables to include in the final models and in order to find the most parsimonious models. P-values of 0.2 and 0.4 were considered as a threshold to include and to eliminate variables. Odds ratios (ORs) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using ordered and logistic regression. Standardized regression coefficients (\u03b2) were presented for the linear regression models. All tests were two-sided with p-values less than or equal to 0.05 considered statistically significant.",

Notably, the highest achieved score on the knowledge of infectious diseases related to travel was 7 out of a maximum score of 14, and only 1.8% provided correct answers to seven questions and were aware of none of these diseases. Travel diarrhea (91.9%), hepatitis A (44.5%), malaria (44.3%), and cholera (36.5%) were the more recurrent diseases known by pharmacists. For all participants, the total score for knowledge of infectious diseases related to travel ranged between 0 and 7, with a mean of 2.9. Associations between the different outcomes of interest and potential predictor variables using multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses are shown in Table 2. From the initial model and after the stepwise backward procedure, the final ordered logistic regression model with the outcome the score of the knowledge about the infectious diseases related to travel comprised two variables: level of knowledge and sources of information about travel medicine. Pharmacists who had heard about travel medicine (OR = 2.28; 95% CI = 1.26\u20134.11), having received information from scientific journals and educational activities (OR = 5.57; 95% CI = 3.42\u20139.1) and from the Internet and mass media (OR = 3.96; 95% CI = 2.37\u20136.6), compared with those who did not receive information, were more likely to have a good knowledge about the more frequent infectious diseases related to travel (Model 1).",

First, the cross-sectional design of this study can only demonstrate associations between the different outcomes of interest and the observed determinants, and it is not possible to say anything about causality. Second, data collection through the telephone survey was based on self-reported information, and so may be subject to reporting bias. Third, there is also the risk for social desirability bias, by which participants do not report attitudes and behaviors fully or accurately and may provide the responses they believe the researcher wants to know instead of the truth, as opposed to answering honestly, and it is possible that they may over-report socially desirable attitudes and behaviors or under-report socially undesirable attitudes and behaviors. Efforts were made to minimize the risk of these biases by ensuring participants that the study was anonymous and confidential and that their data would be de-identified. Fourth, it is possible that pharmacists with specific positive or negative opinions or interest in the topic were more or less likely to respond to the survey. If such bias exists, it may lead to an over- or underrepresentation of the rate of positive responses. However, the high response rate could offset this bias. Moreover, no difference has been observed between respondents and non-respondents regarding the geographic area of activity. ",
