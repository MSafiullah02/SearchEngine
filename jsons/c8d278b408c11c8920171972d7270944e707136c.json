In this brief report, we sought to identify the prevalence of limitations statements in the medRxiv COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 dataset. Methods: We combined automated methods with manual review to analyse manuscripts for the presence, or absence, either of a defined limitations section in the text, or as part of the general discussion. Results: We identified a structured limitations statement in 28% of the manuscripts, and overall 52% contained at least one mention of a study limitation. Over one-third of manuscripts contained none of the terms that might typically be associated with reporting of limitations. Overall our method performed with precision of 0.97 and recall of 0.91.",

Previous studies on the reporting of limitations in biomedical literature found that over 25% of 300 sampled papers contained no limitations [3] ; while an earlier study, using automated methods to screen 400 articles for the presence of cue words, suggested that 83% did not mention any identifiable limitations statements [4] .",

The author is not a domain expert and so may not have picked up all limitations where they were not clearly expressed. Also, presence or absence of a limitations statement was checked against document text contained within the machine-extracted JSON data, but not against original manuscript PDF. It is possible that in some cases, the text extraction may not have extracted the complete article content. However, this risk was mitigated by performing posthoc checks against the CORD-19 dataset [8] . Finally, the sanity-check search may not have been comprehensive, and limitations may have been stated in a more implicit way that required domain knowledge to interpret. As a result, the recall figure of the automated process may be lower, and the proportion of manuscripts in this collection that do in fact state their limitations may be higher than that reported here. Close reading of the original manuscripts by multiple domain experts would reveal a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of limitations statements, similar to [9] .",

We suggest that it might be beneficial to require a defined, structured statement about study limitations, either as part of the submission process, or clearly delineated within the manuscript.",
