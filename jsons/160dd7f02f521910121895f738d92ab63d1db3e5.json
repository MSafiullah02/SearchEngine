As of February 12, 2020, 59741 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in China, of which 451 cases have been identified in Sichuan province. This disease is caused by infection of a new coronavirus named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the latest research, the novel coronavirus is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus, leading to speculation that this new coronavirus may originate from bats [2, 3] . Current epidemiologic data indicate that person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 is occurring [4] . This disease has become a major health crisis in China, and has the potential to become a worldwide epidemic. According to the guidelines stated by the WHO, epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations, chest images and laboratory findings represent the major screening tools for identifying COVID-19 infection. Diagnostic confirmation is ultimately dependent on respiratory samples tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [5] .",

Eight patients had a history of living in Wuhan, 5 patients had history of contact with proven COVID-19 cases, and 4 patients had no known contact with any COVID-19 patient. Ten of the 17 patients had no significant medical history. The remaining 7 patients had a history of the following comorbidities: hypertension (n = 2), chronic gastritis (n = 2), rheumatic heart disease (n = 1) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 2). RT-PCR of all the patient's sputum was positive for the novel coronavirus nucleic acid. All the 17 patients had lymphopenia on presentation. The white blood cell diff erential count showed that 8 patients had increased neutrophils, 15 patients had decreased eosinophils and 16 patients had decreased lymphocytes. All the 17 patients showed elevated blood levels for C-reactive protein and were transferred to infection isolation rooms.HRCT findingsAll patients underwent HRCT on the day of admission. The time from symptom onset to performing the initial HRCT ranged from 6 hours to 11 days (median, 4.04 days). The initial HRCT scan on the day of admissionshowed that 12 of 17 patients had ground-glass opacities (GGOs). Five of the 17 patients had a combination of consolidation and GGOs. The distribution of abnormalities was in the subpleural lung regions in 12 patients, bilateral in 14 and unilateral in 3 of 17 patients. Both upper and lower lobes were involved in 15 patients, only upper lobe was involved in 2 patients. Air bronchogram was identified in 3 patients. None of the patients had tree-in-bud pattern, cavitation or pleural effusion. Follow-up HRCT scan were performed in 5 patients. In three of the 5 that showed markedly decreased consolidation, fibrotic changes developed (The timeintervals between the initial HRCT and follow-up was ranged between 6 to 11 days), while the other 2 patients showed mild progression with increased extent and density of opacities (The time intervals between the initial HRCT and follow-up was ranged between 2 to 3 days). figure1",
