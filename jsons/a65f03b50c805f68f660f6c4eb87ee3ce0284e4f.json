Chronic and civilisation illnesses are well represented and contribute to this trend. Infectious diseases often inform short risk hypes. AIDS' long-term presence has become a less prominent topic, as treatment improves and panic subsides. An epidemiological worldview and strong references to scientific studies carry the instantiation of risk. There is less conscious and/or agentive risk-taking in the reporting on health and illness than in other social domains. While women and children (for example) are frequently represented in relation to risk, they are less likely to be presented as taking risks, and more likely to experience them.",

From a sociological point of view, individuals are expected to manage health and illness as responsibly as, for instance, their finances, intimate relationships and careers. However, it is not clear whether the risk is mobilised in the same way when reporting on (possible) harm in different contexts. This chapter explores in more detail a number of health-related discourse-semantic issues which took place between 1987 and 2014. For this end, we derived a health-specific subcorpus from the NYT corpus, using the title and topic metadata accompanying each article (compare Chap. 3) . This ensures that the results are less influenced by dynamics in other thematic domains such as economics and politics.",

            "text": "We start the analysis by examining the relative occurrence of RISK words in the context of health compared to other thematic domains (Sect. 5.1). We move on with exploring whether the nature of risk, as suggested by Beck (1992) , influences media reporting. As an example, we use the increasing dominance of chronic and lifestyle diseases in contrast to the occasional media hypes on infectious diseases such as the 2009 swine flu or AIDS (Sect. 5.2). Scholars such as Beck have challenged notions of modernisations which assume a linear progression of a rationalist and calculative worldview (such as in the work of Max Weber and Talcott Parsons) . Scholars working in a governmentality framework emphasised that the modern worldview finds repeatedly new ways to adapt modern technologies to new challenges (e.g. O'Malley 2008). We explore whether the social understanding of health and illness is increasingly framed by a rationalist calculative world view as is characteristic of epidemiology (Sect. 5.3). However, changes in the discourse-semantics of risk might not be due to general social change in the understanding of the world. There might be different reasons why news production refers increasingly to scientific studies and reports, and thus, in the frequency of risk words and their grammatical behaviour. Beck (1992) suggests that advanced modern societies have a growing need for the provisions of scientific evidence while critical media studies scholars would make primarily economic factors responsible for the tendency to underpin news with scientific expertise (Sect. 5.4). Finally, a number of scholars have suggested that recent decades have seen a growing emphasis on individualist values (Douglas and Wildavsky 1982; Putnam 2000) and a growing emphasis on individual decisionmaking (Beck 1992) . To examine these issues, we explore the extent to which everyday people occur in risker positions. We further examine differences between social groups dominating as participants of risk in the general corpus compared with the health corpus and which social groups are presented as generally being at-risk (Sect. 5.5).",

AIDS, similarly, is the most prominent entity co-occurring with risk in 1987, with potentially higher peaks outside of the data sampling period. This shows that health and scandal, and health-related scandals, in particular, have great potential to influence short-term frequencies of risk communication. It also proves a clear difference between short-term risk hypes as in the case of the Vioxx scandal and long-term issues that feed into a lasting and only slowly decreasing level of RISK in media coverage as in the case of AIDS. With the character of AIDS changing from an acute deadly infectious disease to a manageable chronic illness, risk words co-occurring alongside the condition are decreasing in usage (Berridge 1996) . We will examine the difference of the character of risk in the following.",

Similar issues such as the SARS outbreak in Southern China (2002) (2003) , as well as other zoonotic diseases, repeatedly feed into the concerns about a large epidemic, similar to the 1918 Spanish flu, which cost millions of people their lives. Organisations such as the WHO suggested that it is not a question of whether an infectious disease such as the Spanish flu would hit again, but simply when (Woolf 2014) . AIDS was such a case of an (inter)national emergency, where potentially everyone was at-risk of transmission (though of course, groups such as gay men and blood transfusion recipients were especially vulnerable). But over the years, in the Western world, AIDS has been managed successfully and thereby increasingly lost newsworthiness. The recent Ebola virus epidemic (2013-2016) is a recent warning that infectious diseases still pose a threat. There were major concerns that the virus could spread in the Western world; however, Ebola remained mainly endemic to West Africa. As a result, it did not become an ongoing major news event in Western news coverage. In contrast to claims of the continuous threat of an outbreak of a high-impact infectious disease, there is a well-known trend of civilisation illnesses and chronic illnesses becoming more dominant influencers of population health (e.g. Kury\u0142owicz and Kopczy\u0144ski 1986) . But are well-known and ongoing concerns about lifestyle and chronic illnesses newsworthy enough to make it into the print media and is the growing use of risk words linked to reporting on such illnesses? Or are risk words deployed in relation to the repeatedly occurring threats of new infectious diseases?",

He suggests that the shift towards risk cannot be explained by a change in terminology only. Instead, he hypothesised that the risk shift results from a particular social culture that developed historically and is linked to the development of probability statistics, to a focus on risk management and to health promotion and computer technology. However, he does not provide evidence regarding the extent to which the risk epidemic might have influenced public discourse.",

The nominal group RISK FACTOR stands for the notion of health and illness being influenced by a range of distinct variables, which together affect the likelihood of a negative outcome such as illness or disease. For example, smoking, drinking and unhealthy diet are all risk factors increase the likelihood of heart disease. It is important to note that for a generalised worldview, it is not necessary that the actual risk factors and their influence are objectively known or calculable but that it is expected that such factors exist and could at least theoretically be identified. Figure 5 .5 shows that in both the general corpus and the health subcorpus, we find such a trend of an increasing presence of the RISK FACTOR. There is much more variation in relative frequencies in the health subcorpus (due in large part to its smaller size). Even so, the overall relative frequency of the risk factor is much stronger which supports the view that the thinking in different factors contributing to the occurrence of an undesired event such as an illness is much more prominent in the health sector than in other social domains.",

However, media studies have emphasised that the organisational and broader economic conditions of news production are important elements for understanding the production of news (Herman and Chomsky 1988; Philo 2007) . Institutional changes in news production such as growing concentration and competition with online (social) media during recent decades have had a potentially profound effect on the genre and subgenres of traditional print journalism. News are increasingly produced with increased time pressures, for global, online consumption, often with heavy budget constraints. Reports on particular issues such as new technologies, health and illness or social policy often build on general journalistic expertise rather than specialised journalism. When time is limited, journalists might rely on information provided by sources considered trustworthy in general, such as scientific experts and scientific research (Grundmann and Scott 2014) .",

In a similar vein, it could be argued that specialised journalists would become part of the epistemic communities focused on issues such as climate change. Consequently, specialised journalists would increasingly use language practices typical of the particular epistemic community they are part of. From a different angle, following a societal macro-perspective, Beck (1992) argued that in late modern societies, when scientific expertise has come under pressure, scientific evidence is even more important for claims-making. Complementing the former argument of the economic pressure on news production, the media might utilise science as a point of reference in news coverage to provide their reports with more weight and objectivity, and thereby, discourses of risk would become more pervasive.",

Showing the 'human face' of suffering, making links to personal experiences, and/or showing that everyone could be affected and other dimensions have each been highlighted as being central for both successfully constructing social problems (Loseke 2003) and newsworthiness (Kitzinger 1999) . Health researchers have shown that good health is often considered as normal-an assumption which is often not much reflected upon until it is challenged. A diagnosis of a chronic illness is therefore experienced as a biographical disruption which questions generalised expectations of health and requires a reordering of one's identity and biography (Bury 1982) .

We found only 647 instantiation of words as riskers in the health corpus, which is 0.03% of all words in the health corpus. While this is an important finding in and of itself, it had serious consequences for the remainder of our analysis: the frequency of grammatical risking in the health subcorpus is so low that longitudinal change could not reliably be quantified. In comparison, in the NYT corpus, 17,408 words occur in risker positions-0.14% of all words, or nearly three times the relative frequency of riskers in the health subcorpus.

As we have shown elsewhere, cancer, in general, has an unclear trajectory, while some specific cancers, such as breast cancer, shift steadily in frequency. The continuous relevance of cancer indicates that ongoing research has not yet helped to overcome the illness. In contrast, as AIDS shifted from being understood as an infectious disease to a chronic illness, and as individuals learned of strategies for controlling the risk of infection, AIDS risk reporting dropped significantly, with AIDS risk almost negligible compared with other threats to health (compare Fig. 4.11) . Focussing on at-risk participants shows some remarkable differences to the above findings on risk participants in general. In health discourse in the NYT, there are particular groups which are very typically qualified as being vulnerable and at-risk. Outstanding are children, who are the most common at-risk entity in both general and health corpora. This reflects both the newsworthiness of reporting on children as vulnerable (Seale 2003) and the importance of risk language when reporting on vulnerable children. The at-risk status for the even younger babies refers to health as well. With children growing up and becoming youth and students, the at-risk status shifts away from health issues.

Even though news hype regarding infectious diseases take place from time to time, the larger and increasing body of the news mobilising risk languages refers to chronic and civilisation illnesses. We found an indication for a changing worldview in risk reporting, as well as a larger body of news coverage referring to scientific research. Thereby, two developments seem to complement one another: first, a changing culture in the understanding of health and illness which rests on a rationalist epidemiological worldview (Skolbekken 1995) ; second is a growing pressure and need to produce legitimate news-a process that involves building on trustworthy evidence such as scientific research (Beck 1992) . Finally, we found that active risking/risk taking is clearly underrepresented in the health domain. Only about 3.7% of all riskers in the general corpus are in the health domain, an almost negligible number. At the same time, children are a group which is strongest connected to the at-risk construct. CHILD is leading in the health corpus as well as in the general corpus reflecting the major social concern about children. Altogether, the health corpus shows a broader spread of at-risk status across different general people categories including man, woman, people and population indicating that the general concern about women is not expressed through the at-risk compound.",

For example, in Fig. 5.3, cancer and cholesterol and, in Fig. 5.4, lung cancer do not show clear trajectories.
