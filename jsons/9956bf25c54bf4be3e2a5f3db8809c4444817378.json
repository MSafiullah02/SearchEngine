Electronic service quality measures the level of satisfaction deliver to bank customers through online banking digital solutions. This paper provides an investigation of electronic service quality based on customers' perceptions in South Africa. The paper presents findings based on quantitative data from 184 online banking customers using E-S-QUAL measurement scale. The results show that banks are meeting customer expectations of service quality delivery, although there is room for improvement. The study has practical implications to financial institutions in South Africa, as it highlights areas of attention to improve service quality delivered to online banking customers.",

As such, the business model of financial institutions depends on customer satisfaction realised through customer loyalty and retention [1] . Improved service quality is one such mechanism of ensuring customer satisfaction [1] . In the context of banking, service providers need to consistently meet and exceed customer expectations for both face-to-face and online banking delivery models. Consequently, customer satisfaction needs a holistic approach and banks are continuously looking for ways to attract new customers and retain existing customers. In South Africa's cash-based economy [2] meaning that a significant amount of transactions still relies on cash rather than cashless means such as money transfers and credit card services. Hence, advances in technology still need to be coupled by in-branch operational advancements as well to fully satisfy the customer base.",

However, Rauyruen and Miller [7] identified factors that impact customer satisfaction, in addition to contextual and personal aspects, price, product quality and service quality also plays a role. According to Hallowell [8] , profitability of banks depends on customer loyalty derived from customer satisfaction. Service quality, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty in retail banking are linked together [9] . Mihelis et al.

The dimensions are efficiency, fulfilment, system availability, and privacy. Efficiency measures how effective the website responds to customer needs. Fulfilment deals with timeous and accuracy of service delivery through digital channels. System availability is concerned about the system downtime, while privacy measures how the system protects customers' information. Given the increasing introduction of online services, a new scale was necessary to measure service quality delivered through online serviceshence the emergence of E-S-QUAL. Kenova and Jonasson [33] developed an online banking E-S-QUAL scale with these dimensions, service performance, website characteristics, communication, and efficiency. Yaya et al. [34] evaluated a number of studies that used E-S-QUAL scale and found that the scale is still relevant although some improvements are needed as technology advances, especially regarding its application in different environments.",

A positive coefficient means that there is a direct relation between the two variables, meaning that as one variable increases, the other increases [36] . Age-income have a moderate positive relationship, meaning as age of users increases so does their income. The same trend is noted for both incomeexperience and income-device relations. High-income earners tend to make use of both mobile and desktop computer to access online banking and are generally more satisfied with the service quality. On the other hand, the relations between income-use_frequency have a moderate negative relationship. This implies that as income increases the frequency at which users access online banking decreases. Interestingly, only device has any notable correlation with E-S-QUAL mean values, that is, a very weak positive relationship. This leads to the conclusion that E-S-QUAL is not influenced by any of the variables investigated since no medium or strong relationships exist at 0.05 level, albeit a very weak one with device.

The scale lacks emphasis on new aspects in online customer satisfaction such as user experience and electronic satisfaction. These can be considered for further research to assist in the evolution of E-S-QUAL. A larger sample would also make the generalisation of findings across the whole population of online banking users. This also allows the reporting to include bank names without unwarranted prejudice. Further research is needed to also include current aspects such as user experience of online banking that affect customer satisfaction and provide a holistic service quality assessment. Also of consideration as future work is a qualitative study that investigates new constructs by asking online banking users what services they need, instead of an evaluation of the currently provided services.

The average mean E-S-QUAL scores for individual respondents across the sample showed that users are generally satisfied with the service quality of online banking. The exception were four questions that had mean scores of below four with two lowest scores concerning system availability. Inferential statistical results show that there are insignificant differences in mean scores based on independent samples t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and Pearson correlation analyses. Using Levene's test, gender showed no statistical significance, as this was the only variable with dichotomous values. One-way ANOVA tests identified the variable device as the only variable that has influence on E-S-QUAL scores, while all other variables tested had no influence customers' perceptions of online banking service quality. This suggest banks need to offer online banking through a variety of devices, in order to optimise service quality to improve customer satisfaction. Overall, the study accept the null hypothesis and concludes that the difference in E-S-QUAL mean values are statistically insignificant for all moderating variables. This means banks can take holistic approaches in improving service quality that does not target specific demographic groups but the whole customer base in addressing service quality problems. The significance of electronic service quality measurement is to identify areas for improvement and encourage wide usage of digital channels. Especially, considering huge investments financial institutions are making in digital channels.
