            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped RNA virus which is responsible for approximately 80% of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Current lines of evidence have supported the functional involvement of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in many viral infectious diseases. However, the overall biological effect and clinical role of lncRNAs in RSV infection remain unclear. In this study, lncRNAs related to respiratory virus infection were obtained from the lncRNA database, and we collected 144 clinical sputum specimens to identify lncRNAs related to RSV infection. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection indicated that the expression of lncRNA negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) in RSV-positive patients was significantly lower than that in uninfected patients, but lncRNA psoriasis-associated non-protein coding RNA induced by stress (PRINS), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), and Nettoie Salmonella pas Theiler's (NeST) showed no difference in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, overexpression of NRAV promoted RSV proliferation in A549 and BEAS-2B cells, and vice versa, indicating that the downregulation of NRAV was part of the host antiviral defense. RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed that NRAV was mainly located in the cytoplasm. Through RNA sequencing, we found that Rab5c, which is a vesicle transporting protein, showed the same change trend as NRAV. Subsequent investigation revealed that NRAV was able to favor RSV production indirectly by sponging microRNA miR-509-3p so as to release Rab5c and facilitate vesicle transportation. The study provides a new insight into virus-host interaction through noncoding RNA, which may contribute to exploring potential antivirus targets for respiratory virus. IMPORTANCE The mechanism of interaction between RSV and host noncoding RNAs is not fully understood. In this study, we found that the expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) was reduced in RSV-infected patients, and overexpression of NRAV facilitated RSV production in vitro, suggesting that the reduction of NRAV in RSV infection was part of the host antiviral response. We also found that NRAV competed with vesicle protein Rab5c for microRNA miR509-3p in cytoplasm to promote RSV vesicle transport and accelerate RSV proliferation, thereby improving our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of RSV infection.

(A) The overexpression of NRAV was analyzed by RT-qPCR in A549 and BEAS-2B cells. (B) RSV replication was examined by plaque assay in NRAV overexpressed A549 or BEAS-2B cells infected with RSV. Virus titers were measured at different hours postinfection. (C) Expression of RSV F protein was measured at the indicated time by immunoblotting in NRAV overexpressed A549 or BEAS-2B cells infected with RSV.

NRAV/miR-509-3p/Rab5c Axis in RSV Infection Journal of Virology FIG 3 Knocking down NRAV inhibited RSV replication. (A) siRNA-based knockdown of NRAV was analyzed by RT-qPCR in A549 and BEAS-2B cells. (B) RSV replication was examined by plaque assay in NRAV knocked-down cells infected with RSV. Virus titers were measured at different hours postinfection. (C) Expression of RSV F protein was measured at the indicated time by immunoblotting in NRAV knocked-down A549 or BEAS-2B cells infected with RSV. (D and E) Expression of RSV genes was analyzed at the indicated time by RT-qPCR in NRAV knocked-down BEAS-2B (D) or A549 (E) cells infected with RSV.

Numerous reports have shown that lncRNAs play important roles in the process of viral infection (9, 10) . For example, following human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, late protein Vpu induces host cells to express lncRNA noncoding repressor of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (NRON) at a high level; afterward, NRON binds to the NFAT scaffold complex, resulting in transcriptional inhibition of HIV (11) .

The relative expression levels of these lncRNAs were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in 144 clinical sputum specimens (RSV -, n \u03ed 75, RSV \u03e9 , n \u03ed 69) ( Table 1 ). The results showed that NRAV expression in the RSV-infected group was lower than that in the uninfected groups (Fig. 1A) , while NEAT1, PRINS, and NeST were not detected in these sputum samples.",

Regarding the different cell types in sputum, Guiot reported that there were macrophages (49%), squamous or epithelial cells (23%), lymphocytes (3%), eosinophils (1%) and so on, which could be divided into immune cells and epithelial cells (13) . Considering that the proportion of lymphocytes and eosinophils in sputum is much lower than other cell types, we selected macrophages and epithelial cells to evaluate NRAV levels. For epithelial cells, A549 or BEAS-2B cells were infected with RSV for 72 h. Total RNA was collected at indicated time points since infection, and qRT-PCR was performed. NRAV was reduced in A549 (Fig. 1B) or BEAS-2B (Fig. 1C ) cells during RSV infection, but PRINS, NEAT1, and NeST showed no difference ( Fig. 1E to G). Similarly, for macrophages, the M\u233d-THP-1cells (14) were infected and detected in the same manner. However, the expression of NRAV was decreased slightly in M\u233d-THP-1cells, and the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 1D) . As a result, NRAV was significantly downregulated in epithelial cells after RSV infection, and we mainly focused on A549 and BEAS-2B in vitro for the following study.",

To investigate which mRNAs were affected by NRAV expression, genome-wide mRNA sequencing was performed in cells as described below. In the overexpression group, pcDNA3.1-NRAV was transfected into A549 cells (n \u03ed 3), while pcDNA3.1 empty vector was transfected as the control (n \u03ed 3). In the knockdown group, NRAV siRNA (si-NRAV) (n \u03ed 1) and negative-control siRNA (si-control) (n \u03ed 1) were transfected into A549 cells. Data implied that there were 15 upregulated mRNAs in NRAV-overexpressed cells compared with the controls (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), and a total of 130 downregulated mRNAs were found in NRAV knocked-down cells (Table S2) (P \u03fd 0.05; fold change, \u05462). Interestingly, in the overlap of the two comparisons, we found only one molecule, Rab5c (GenBank accession number NM_201434.3), which was in the same trend as NRAV (Fig. 4A) . To further confirm the mRNA sequence result, Rab5c levels were determined by qRT-PCR in clinical sputum specimens (RSV -75, RSV \u03e9 69), which were the same samples used in Fig. 1A , and Rab5c expression in RSVinfected samples was lower than that in uninfected ones (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, we examined Rab5c expression by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4C ) or immunoblotting ( Fig. 4D and E) in vitro, and RSV infection induced lower Rab5c expression than in the controls. The above results indicated that Rab5c was positively correlated with NRAV during RSV infection. As an early endosomal marker protein, Rab5 is mainly involved in cellular vesicle transport and endocytosis (16, 17) . The Rab5 family contains Rab5a, b, and c, which share similar function and location (18, 19) . It has been reported that RSV entered respiratory epithelial cells in the form of macropinocytosis, which was then transformed by a Rab5-positive macropinosome. The RSV expression level was decreased significantly when the cells were transfected with Rab5 dominant negative mutant (20) , suggesting that the Rab5 molecule was directly involved in the intracellular transmission of RSV virus. Furthermore, we performed an immunofluorescence assay, and confocal microscopy showed that RSV could be colocalized with Rab5positive vacuoles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4F) , which was consistent with Krzyzaniak's report (20) .",

Data showed that infection of RSV induced higher expression of miR-509-3p in vivo and in vitro. To investigate the direct association between NRAV and miR-509-3p, we generated a biotin-labeled NRAV probe and a negative-control (NC) probe. A549 cell lysates were incubated with the probes overnight. The specific binding was confirmed by affinity pulldown of endogenic miR-509-3p and miR-653-5p (used as a control). MiR-509-3p and miR-653-5p were then extracted and assessed by qRT-PCR. Meanwhile, the NRAV level was examined by qRT-PCR to evaluate the efficacy of NRAV pulldown (Fig. 4I ). Data showed that endogenic miR-509-3p, other than miR-653-5p, could be pulled down by biotin-labeled NRAV.",

Results indicated that RSV production could be improved when NRAV was overexpressed, and replication of RSV was inhibited when silencing NRAV. The experiment was carried out in A549 and BEAS-2B cells in functional experiments. The A549 cell line is derived from human adenocarcinoma type II alveolar cells, and BEAS-2B was developed from primary human bronchial epithelial cells transformed with adenovirus type 12 (Ad12)-SV40. Different characteristics were observed in these two cell lines during RSV infection. Hillyer (27) has reported that A549 cells are permissive to RSV infection and produce proinflammatory genes after RSV infection. Instead, BEAS-2B cells could restrict the infection and produce molecules characteristic of an antiviral reaction. Consequently, A549 cells were highly susceptible to RSV infection, whereas BEAS-2B cells limited infection to small individual foci or cells during RSV infection. Similar to those results, in our study, compared with BEAS-2B, when A549 cells were infected with RSV, the increase of RSV gene expression was much more obvious. Furthermore, overexpression of NRAV led to robust enhancement of RSV genes in A549, and the degree of increase was significantly higher than that in BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 5A and B) .",

It is widely acknowledged that transfection of an NC siRNA or empty vector DNA might have a negligible impact on cells. In effect, however, Stepanenko and Heng have reported that a range of molecular manipulations from the NC siRNA or empty vector will probably influence the biological system, resulting in types of nonspecific effects on cells in the NC group. Furthermore, during the transient transfection, due to differences in nucleic acid type, total base amount, and molecular structure, the nonspecific impact from empty vector backbone RNA (pcDNA3.1, 5,428 bp) and siRNA (double-strand short interfering RNA, 21 bp) could differ from each other (28) , which might induce the expression features of RSV genes that were quite different in the EV and siNC groups.",

Based on the results that NRAV was mainly located in the cytoplasm subcelluarly and showed the same trend with Rab5c, we tentatively put forward the idea that NRAV and Rab5c might share the same miRNA in cytoplasm, which is a major miRNA pool. In the light of bioinformatics analysis and a previous report, miR-509-3p has been reported to be able to bind Rab5c (22) . Meanwhile, NRAV was predicted to bind to miR-509-3p's seed region (Fig. 4L) . Subsequently, we combined RNA pulldown (Fig. 4I ) and dual luciferase reporter assays ( Fig. 4M and N) to identify the NRAV/miR-509-3p association. In addition, we found that the effect of NRAV on RSV could be reversed by miR-509-3p.",

It is interesting that RSV F mRNA expression in Fig. 5F and G were not consistent with their protein levels in Fig. 5H and I. In order to clarify this phenomenon, we separately extracted total RNA at 24, 36, and 48 h to detect the expressions of the F gene. The results showed that whether the RNA was extracted 24, 36, or 48 h postinfection, silencing NRAV reduced RSV F expression, and miR-509-3p inhibitor could rescue this decrease. With the extension of time, however, the expression of the F gene changed dynamically in the rescue group. When the cells were infected for 24 or 36 h, miR-509-3p inhibitor could significantly rescue the expression of F in mRNA level (data not shown). Nevertheless, at 48 h postinfection, the recovery of F expression was not as high as that at 24 or 36 h. Interestingly, in the rescue group, the mRNA level of the F gene at 24 h postinfection was somewhat consistent with F protein at 48 h after infection. As a result, when both RNA and protein were extracted at 48 h postinfection, On the other hand, dual luciferase reporter assay ( Fig. 6A and B ) and immunoblotting (Fig. 6C to H) were performed to verify that Rab5c could be positively influenced by NRAV, and similarly, the influence could be abolished by miR-509-3p. However, both RSV and Rab5c levels have not completely returned to NC levels. It is probable that NRAV is able to regulate virus proliferation in multiple ways, for example, an NRAV/ histone modification/interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) mechanism (15) .",
