A lumbar puncture revealed CSF pleocytosis (18 leukocytes/mm3; 35% monocytes, 33% lymphocytes, and 32% neutrophils); glucose and protein were within reference ranges. Empiric antibiotic therapy was continued, and acyclovir and antifungal therapy were added to his regimen. Repeat lumbar puncture performed on hospital day 9 showed persistent pleocytosis.

According to his wife, the patient often sat outdoors during the few weeks before hospitalization, although she did not recall his reporting any mosquito bites. Nevertheless, we believe he most likely contracted SLEV in California, because his history of travel to Arizona 5 months prior was not consistent with the incubation period of the disease (4\u201321 days); mosquitoes are less prevalent at the higher altitudes of Payson, Arizona; and the patient\u2019s SLEV sequence was most closely related to a strain from a June 2016 Kern County mosquito pool. Given the reemergence of SLEV in the southwestern United States, clinicians from affected areas will need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease, particularly during local community outbreaks or high SLEV activity detected through mosquito surveillance efforts.",

A) Multiple sequence alignment of 32 complete SLEV genomes from GenBank and the 2 SLEV genomes corresponding to the case-patient\u2019s strain and a strain from a mosquito collected in June 2016 from Kern County, California (red circles and text). Alignment was performed using MAFFT (10), followed by tree generation using a neighbor-joining algorithm using Geneious (11). The cluster containing the 2014\u20132016 California and Arizona SLEV genome, including those from the case-patient and 2016 mosquito pool, is rooted by SLEV strains sequenced from mosquitoes collected in Argentina in 1978 and 2005 (black circles). Isolates are named by location, year of collection, strain name, and GenBank accession number. Bootstrap support values are given for each node. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. B) Geographic spread of SLEV in the Americas, from Argentina in 2005 to California and Arizona during 2014\u20132016. Because genome sequences from US states reporting SLEV activity are not publicly available and surveillance for SLEV in South and Central America is not routinely performed, the pathway or pathways by which the virus came to the southwestern United States remain unclear (question mark).
