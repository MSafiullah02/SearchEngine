Two isoforms of ACC were identified, ACC1 and ACC2 [3]. Malonyl-CoA synthesized by ACC1 serves as a carbon donor for de novo fatty acid synthesis, whereas malonyl-CoA produced by ACC2 works as an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation [4]. ACC is rapidly inactivated upon phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), whereas dephosphorylation activates the enzyme [5]. Besides, ACC can also be regulated promptly by allosteric agents, such as Soraphen A, which more likely targets ACC1, and 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furancarboxylic acid (TOFA), which more likely targets both ACC1 and ACC2 [6, 7].",

Recent studies found that inhibition of ACC activity downregulates the differentiation of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells, while upregulates the differentiation of Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Treg) [8]. It is found that Th17 cells depend on ACC1-mediated de novo fatty acid synthesis and the underlying glycolytic\u2013lipogenic metabolic pathway for their development, while Treg cells take up exogenous fatty acids for this purpose [8]. In addition, T cell-specific deletion of ACC1 demonstrated that ACC1-mediated de novo lipogenesis is essential for CD8+ T cell expansion [9].",

In addition, recent studies also demonstrated a role of Th17 immunity in the pathogenesis of asthma, especially neutrophil-dominant airway inflammation, which is associated with severe asthma [14]. Treg cells are responsible for sustaining immune tolerance to allergen, decreased or defected suppressing effects of Treg cells also contribute to the development of allergic asthma [15]. Therefore, imbalance of Th17/Treg is an additional mechanism of asthma and a new target for asthma therapy. Our previous study has shown that abnormal Th17 immunity is also involved in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma [16].",

By contrast, the protein expression of pACC in lung of asthma model of mice was lower than that in control mice. This protein expression pattern of ACC and pACC suggests a possible role of ACC in asthma. TOFA is a cell-permeable small molecule and also an allosteric inhibitor of ACC. We found that TOFA treatment slightly decreased ACC protein expression in the lung of asthma model of mice. The solvent DMSO had no effects on ACC protein expression (Fig. 2a). However, neither TOFA nor DMSO displayed significant effects on pACC protein expression in lung of asthma model of mice, albeit there was a slight trend of increase in pACC expression in TOFA-treated asthma model of mice (Fig. 2b). Our results suggest that TOFA may reduce the activity of ACC primarily by allosteric effect, but not by phosphorylation of ACC, at least in lung of asthma model of mice.",

In addition, the ex vivo effect of TOFA on contraction of airway smooth muscle strips, which minimize the impact of airway inflammation and other cytokines, will give deep insights into the underlying mechanisms of increased AHR induced by TOFA.",

In fact, recent study showed that HDM induced both Th2 and Th17 cytokine profile and mixture of eosinophilic and neutrophilic airway inflammation [37]; therefore, effects of TOFA should be conducted with HDM-induced airway inflammation.",

Since deficiency of ACC1 in mice is embryonic lethal [38], mice with heterozygous genotype of ACC1 may be used to elucidate this question.
