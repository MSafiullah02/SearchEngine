It is caused by a spirochaete of the genus Leptospira, which is now found to have at least nine pathogenic species and over 250 serovars. The global burden of leptospirosis is difficult to quantify due to under-reporting and difficulties in establishing a serological diagnosis. However, it is estimated that in endemic areas (localized geographical areas in Central America, Indian subcontinent, Oceania, and the Caribbean), the incidence of leptospirosis can be as high as 25 clinical infections per 100,000 of population per year (in contrast to 1 per 100,000 per year in non-endemic areas) [2].",

Factors predicting mortality in severe leptospirosis as reported in various studies worldwide have been reviewed by Rajapakse et al. [6] under the categories of predisposition, insult, response and organ dysfunction (similar to the PIRO model used to predict mortality in severe sepsis). Although there was insufficient data to develop a scoring system for mortality prediction, it was noted in this review that serum markers of acute inflammation (tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1, interleukin-6) have not been adequately assessed as prognostic markers. These pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to an increase in the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthatase (iNOS) to synthesize nitric oxide (NO) which is toxic to the bacterium. The role of iNOS and NO production in inflammation has not been clearly determined in leptospirosis; in fact its significance in severe sepsis [7] and other infections such as malaria [8-11] is subject to much debate [12,13]. While its primary role is to combat infection, NO levels have been shown to be elevated in severe leptospirosis [14], leading to the postulate that high NO levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction in leptospirosis. On the other hand, increased iNOS activity may actually protect against organ dysfunction.",

It is estimated that more than 95% of nitrite in whole blood gets converted to nitrate within one hour [16]. Thus, the total blood levels of nitrite and nitrate (NOx) could be considered to be a surrogate marker of serum NO levels. NOx levels in blood are affected by the amount of ingested nitrates; to control for this, measurements should ideally be made after an overnight fast [17]. Furthermore, NOx is excreted renally, thus NOx clearance is reduced in the presence of renal impairment [18]. To correct for this, the use of the ratio of serum NOx/creatinine has been suggested to be a more accurate marker of iNOS activity than crude NOx levels, and was used in the study by Anstey et al. [17] to correct NOx levels for renal function in patients with malaria. Although other factors could influence creatinine levels, and therefore this correction factor too, creatinine levels are the standard index used for assessment of renal dysfunction in acute kidney injury [19]. Therefore the formula NOx/creatinine is currently the only practical formula available to correct NOx levels for renal function.",

Ten microlitres of 1.5 g/mL zinc sulphate solution was added to 1mL of serum, vortexed for 1 minute, and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT=25\u00b0C, i.e., the controlled temperature in the laboratory). The supernatant was pipetted out and centrifuged again at 10,000 g for 10 minutes. The clear serum (100 \u03bcL) was applied in duplicate to a 96-well ELISA plate, 100 \u03bcL of vanadium (III) chloride (8 mg/mL) was added to each well (for reduction of nitrate to nitrite) followed by the addition of 100 \u03bcL of Griess reagent (equal mixture of 1% sulphanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid and 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine hydrochloride in distilled water). The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at RT and the optical density was measured at 540 nm using the ELISA reader (Bio-Tek Instruments INC, USA). A two-fold dilution series (0.193 - 100 \u03bcM) of NaNO2 was prepared from 100 \u03bcM NaNO2 solution using distilled water. Each dilution (100 \u03bcL) was mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent, and the optical density (OD) was measured at 540 nm. A standard curve was plotted against optical density and NaNO2 concentration. Intra-assay coefficient of variability (CV) was 6.55% and inter-assay CV was 8.62%, which indicated good precision and repeatability.",

            "text": "One of the limitations of this study is the confounding factors that can affect serum NOX levels such as age and diet [27]. However, the mean ages of the subjects in the different groups were comparable, and dietary influence was minimized by collecting samples in the early mornings prior to the intake of food. It was also possible that patients with severe disease had a lower dietary contribution of nitrites. This is very difficult to quantify in a clinical study, and no standard methods for quantification exist. However in our study, we compared the incidence and severity of symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite, and there was no difference in the incidence of these symptoms in severe disease compared with non-severe disease. All patients, even the sickest, were able to eat and drink. There was a gender bias in the sample with more males than females. However, this is a well established epidemiological fact in leptospirosis in Sri Lanka, as it is the males who engage more in outdoor activities such as farming which is a major occupational risk factor for leptospirosis [21]. Of the serological tests to diagnose leptospirosis, MAT is the preferred method, and it is also the test recommended by the epidemiology unit of the Ministry of Health in Sri Lanka [21]. However, MAT serology may be insensitive in early acute-phase specimens [28]. Moreover, patients with fulminant leptospirosis may die before seroconversion occurs. A four-fold rise in MAT titer would have helped to differentiate patients with true leptospirosis in the MAT equivocal group [22,29]. However, many patients did not return for follow up visits after discharge and we had to restrict the leptospirosis confirmed group to those with high MAT titers \u2265400. We did not obtain serial NOx measurements in patients (due to logistical difficulties and limited resources) which would have enabled us to predict the earliest point at which NOX levels would start to differ in those with severe disease, thus establishing the approximate earliest point it would be useful as a predictive marker. Based on the results of this initial study a larger multi-centre study was designed by us, and is currently in progress.",

Corrected NOx levels were significantly suppressed in patients with severe leptospirosis. Thus, NOx levels in patients with leptospirosis may be useful to predict severe disease, i.e., the presence of low NOx levels (after correction for renal function) in leptospirosis may predict the development or organ dysfunction. We also demonstrated that chemical conversion of nitrates to nitrite with Vanadium (III) chloride and measuring of NOX levels (modified Griess reaction) is a relatively cheap assay technique that can be employed in resource limited settings.",
