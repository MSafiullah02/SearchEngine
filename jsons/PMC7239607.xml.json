While there has been some centralized effort in adult surgery to standardize and stratify low vs. high acuity [1], this has not yet occurred for pediatric neurosurgery. Given these new restrictions, many fields of medicine have made some general recommendations including head and neck surgery [2], anesthesia [3], cardiac electrophysiology [4], and colorectal surgery [5]. While some recommendations apply to neurosurgery, particularly endoscopic sinonasal and skull base recommendations [2], no manuscripts exist to systematically stratify risk associated with delay in common pediatric neurosurgical procedures.",

Urgent cases that present an immediate threat to the patient\u2019s life or neurologic well-being (e.g., shunt malfunction, acute hematoma evacuation, tumor with hydrocephalus, empyema, spinal cord compression) are straightforward and undergo prompt surgical intervention. Elective surgery is readily defined as cases that offer a negligible or minimal threat of harm to the patient if surgery is delayed for several months. Examples might include skull dermoids/epidermoids, prophylactic spinal lipoma untethering operations, and some craniofacial procedures. These are similarly less challenging in the current environment. However, there are a large number of procedures which are less straightforward in which lack of prompt surgery, while not emergent, may result in neurologic harm to the patient. Delaying all \u201celective\u201d surgeries in this population poses health-related risks, and a review of best available evidence on harm imposed by delaying these operations is warranted.",

            "text": "Low-grade neoplasms characteristically show slow, linear growth with a minimal risk of rapid decline from mass effect [6]. For pilocytic astrocytomas, the greatest risk is likely the development of a cystic component that may show focal accelerated growth [7]. Other lesions such as craniopharyngiomas show highly variable growth patterns and often have a cystic component that may expand more rapidly to cause mass effect or obstruction [8]. Another important consideration in predicting potential risk for focal mass effect is the degree of surrounding edema elicited by the tumor. This risk also correlates with tumor histology [9]. Low-grade tumors such as pilocytic astrocytomas, glioneuronal tumors (DNT, ganglioglioma, etc.) and grade I gliomas typically offer a low risk for acutely developing edema [10]. High-grade pediatric lesions such as PNTs, embryonal tumors, choroid plexus carcinomas, or high-grade gliomas (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) harbor substantially greater risk for edema and secondary rapid increase in mass effect [10].",

            "text": "Similarly, the incidence of hemorrhage into a tumor recurrence is predominantly determined by histologic diagnosis [11]. The pediatric brain tumors with the highest risk for hemorrhage include high-grade embryonal neoplasms of infancy [12], glioblastoma [13], and mixed malignant germ cell tumors [14]. As such, the prior histology of a recurrent lesion is the principle determinant of the acute risk for a sudden decline from hemorrhage or sudden edema. For example, Donofrio et al. [15] noted thin-walled, small, and closely packed vascularization in pediatric patients with cerebellar hemorrhage from pilocytic astrocytomas 10]. White et al. [16] characterized three distinct histological subtypes which correlated with hemorrhagic events in pilocytic astrocytomas [16]. Specifically, thick-walled hyalinized vessels with glomeruloid structures of vascular endothelial hyperplasia with ectatic vessels serve as a nidus for bleeds [16]. Multiple studies in the literature outline the relationship between histologic features and intratumor hemorrhage [15, 17\u201320]. Pagano et al. [21] describe recurrent hemorrhage of pilocytic astrocytomas and stressed the importance of VEGF for aberrant neovascularization and hyperpermeability [21]. Immunohistochemistry is now being better understood through genetic markers. As described by Phoenix et al. [41], medulloblastoma genotype highly dictates the vascular environment and hemorrhagic tendencies of tumors [22]. Most recently, Ishi et al. demonstrated the association of FGFR1 mutation with hemorrhagic events in low-grade pediatric gliomas [23].2.Chiari malformation with syrinxi.Issues/threats with surgical delay:Neurologic decline in upper extremities from syrinxDysesthetic pain from syrinx.",

Only a limited number of papers address acute decline from C1M related syringomyelia [28, 31\u201334]. Massimmi [35] and colleagues identified 3 patients in their center experience and then identified 38 more patients from the literature that showed acute clinical decline [35]. They concluded in 2012 that only 41 of such patients had ever been identified and concluded that sudden presentation is extremely rare [35]. However, morbidity (irreversible motor 37%, 29% respiratory failure) and mortality (20%; 14.5% cardiac arrest) were severe when it did occur [35].Almotairi and colleagues [36] observed 3 patients to acutely decline in a cohort of 65 (3/65 = 4.6%) adult patients from Sweden who were followed and treated for C1M-related syrinx [36]. In this series, the patients that declined acutely demonstrated longer and wider syrinxes that extended more rostrally (above C1) than the larger group who demonstrated no acute decline [36]. The extent of tonsillar herniation did not correlate [36].The response time of a syrinx to operative decompression is unknown and appears gradual. Wetjen and Oldfield [37] studied 29 patients who underwent posterior fossa decompression for C1M and found a median time of 3.6 months (95%CI = 3.0\u20136.5 months) [37]. Experienced Chiari surgeons typically advocate MRI imaging follow-up in 6\u201312 months.Surgical decompression has a consistently good but variable impact on syrinx. Tubbs et al. [29] found that only 4 out of 285 patients with syrinx demonstrated progression after posterior fossa decompression and cranioplasty [29]. Zhang and colleagues [38] demonstrated that 60% of patients who underwent posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty showed a reduction in size. Less is written or available on the time course of syrinx change and the common time point for observations is 6 months. A large meta-analysis by Durham and Fjeld-Olenec [39] that compared techniques of C1M decompression (decompression alone vs. decompression with duraplasty) demonstrated 56\u201387% syrinx resolution with operative decompression [39]. However, small numbers of syrinxes associated with Chiari I decrease in size over time without operative intervention and some syrinxes do not change after posterior fossa.Recovery of neurologic symptoms from a Chiari related syrinx is typically incomplete and permanent. The presence of a syrinx then represents a non-predictable risk factor for irreversible neurologic dysfunction from intrinsic chronic stress and injury to the spinal cord. Sudden decline is very rare but can occur especially from minor injury [28, 31\u201334].",

However, an increased percentage of children have catastrophic epilepsy which is characterized by highly resistant and threatening generalized seizures. These often culminate in repeated episodes of status epilepticus and raise the risk for sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Children with congenital or acquired structural anomalies of the brain such as hemimegalencephaly, holohemispheric dysplasias, hemispheric atrophy, and cystic encephalomalacia (often due to perinatal infarcts/ischemia) are more frequently found to have catastrophic epilepsy than those patients with more normal MRI findings.

Additionally, binary logistic regression demonstrated that younger children (less than 3 years of age) were 2.76 times more likely to achieve a seizure-free outcome compared with older children (4 to 17 years of age) [40]. Furthermore, developmental outcome as assessed by Loddenkemper et al.

Finally, Pelliccia et al.

Symptoms usually consist of pain in the back, buttocks, and legs and variable but progressive loss of neurologic function in the legs and bladder [49]. Prevailing wisdom in pediatric neurosurgery is that once function is lost, it is typically not regained. Thus, the critical immediate distinction in tethered cord is between symptomatic and asymptomatic tethered cord. Intervention for asymptomatic tethered cord is largely prophylactic and is variably controversial depending on the underlying tethering lesion. For example, split cord malformations have a high incidence of inducing progressive neurologic decline unless repaired whereas the natural history of a low-lying spinal conus medullaris is less well established and there is significant controversy surrounding prophylactic untethering.",

[50] retrospectively described the efficacy of surgery given the natural history of tethered cord syndrome. Post-operatively, 7/8 (88%) asymptomatic patients remained this way, 6/26 (23%) improved, and 15/26 (58%) patients were unchanged [50]. Hoffman et al. [51] describe a similar relationship in a cohort of 97 pediatric patients. Fifty-six patients presented before the age of 6 months, and 35 of these patients were neurologically intact [51]. However, of the 41 patients presenting after the age of 6 months, only 12 patients were neurologically intact [51]. Surgery should be performed prior to the onset of neurologic deficits. As demonstrated by Kanev et al. [52] in a cohort of 42 patients presenting with neurologic deficit, 0/42 (0%) of patients regained bladder or bowel function post-operatively [52]. A logarithmic model developed by Kanev et al. using data from two series [51, 52] demonstrates that all patients would develop neurological deficits over time by 12 years of age [53]. While these studies do not provide definitive evidence of a danger with delay, they do suggest that prevention of deficit or worsening of deficits might be more successful with earlier surgery.6.Obstetrical brachial plexus injury",

The need for social distancing and preservation, or limited availability, of personal protective equipment has resulted in widespread curtailment of elective operative procedures. During this time, it is essential to establish an informed hierarchy of need for pediatric neurosurgical cases. Many pediatric neurosurgery cases are urgent and must proceed. Examples include shunt obstructions, infections, post-traumatic hematomas, and myelomeningocele closures. Other cases are clearly elective and results are not likely impacted by limited delays. However, there exist a significant number of pediatric neurosurgical cases for which the impact of time delay in intervention is unknown. Some cases appear elective but review of published experience demonstrates that poorer outcomes or higher risk accompanies delay. An informed hierarchy of need incorporates the potential increase into adverse outcomes associated with delay as well as the imminent threat to the patient in the short term. The cases selected for this report are not comprehensive but are representative of a substantial component of elective pediatric neurosurgical practice. Within these cases, there are multiple examples of how a delay in performing surgery during an optimal eligibility window is associated with more adverse effects over the life span.",

Exposure risks not only center on airway control and intubation but also extend to risks associated with aerosolized particles including blood, CSF, and bone. Cases involving invasion into the airways and bony sinuses also carry elevated risks. Examples would include anterior skull base procedures, craniofacial procedures, and evacuation of empyemas that arise from erosion through bony sinuses. Presurgical COVID19 screening should be implemented in areas where there is no current shortage of testing for symptomatic patients. If limited testing is available, cases in which exposure is gained endonasally should require preoperative COVID19 screening.",

For the sake of completeness, some basic recommendations can be made regarding the procedures listed. For example, craniosynostosis repair should not exceed 4 months to prevent open surgery. Total obstetrical brachial plexus repair should be performed by 3 months of age to prevent neurologic deficit. Additionally, asymptomatic tethered cord and Chiari I malformation with syrinx should not be postponed longer than 6 months as the purpose of surgery is symptom prophylaxis. Lesional epilepsy represents a more complex disease process and a case-by-case evaluation is necessary depending on seizure burden, medication use, and concurrent tumor. As the referenced literature demonstrates, there are clear transition points in childhood (1 year of age and 3 years of age) that represent important checkpoints for intervention.",
