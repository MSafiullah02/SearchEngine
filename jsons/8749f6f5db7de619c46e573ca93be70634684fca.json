In the field of bacterial infection, this was facilitated by the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Sir Alexander Fleming [1] . Unfortunately, as antibiotics became more widely used, bacteria responded by developing various forms of resistance to these treatments, which has rapidly accelerated creating a serious and global problem [2] . Very few antimicrobials have been developed in the last two decades which is now limiting the scope of action [3] . Currently, antibiotics also lack diversity in their cellular targets and new antibiotic classes are urgently needed as treatment choices become limited [3] . As the use of these antibiotics has increased so has the level, response, and complexity of resistance by microbes [4] .",

Data suggests that the top three consumers are India at 12.9 billion units, China at 10.0 billion units, and USA at 6.8 billion units in 2010 [9] . In BRICS countries, the increase in antibiotic misuse has been partly due to the increasing size of the population, but also improved drug access and socioeconomic status. The absence of antibiotic policies has also played an important role. However, the USA has the highest level of antibiotic misuse for both humans and livestock and is also where antimicrobial stewardship programmes are not widely implemented [10] .",

They are readily available for patients to buy themselves and appear to be increasingly popular particularly in the UK. This growing public interest in herbs could reduce reliance on antibiotics, especially for self-limiting infections. A recent WHO report on traditional medicines noted that the majority of the world's population depends on traditional medicines for primary healthcare including the treatment of infections [31] . Plant secondary metabolites have already demonstrated their potential as antimicrobials when used alone and or synergistically, or as potentiators of other antimicrobial medicines. The use of these metabolites and herbal medicines as resistance-modifying agents (RMAs) represents an increasingly active research area. Phytomedicines frequently act through different mechanisms than conventional antibiotics and could, therefore be of use in the treatment of resistant bacteria. Plant extracts have great potential as antimicrobial compounds against microorganisms especially in addressing the therapeutic vacuum in managing symptoms or acting as antimicrobial medicines themselves. The therapeutic utility of these products, will, however, require further research and undergo strict quality control to guarantee product consistency [32] . Changing public attitudes together with increasing awareness of the critical importance of an individual's responsibility to dealing with infection has become critical during the COVID-19 outbreak. Self-help techniques to prevent and minimise the risks of infection are key, and should always include washing hands in soap and water. Before the outbreak, the College of Medicine (https://collegeofmedicine.org.uk/) held a 1-day seminar and launched its initiative on 'Before we really need antibiotics -what are the healthy alternatives?' Based on evidence and cost they developed a resource based on research evidence that explored avoiding antibiotics by using traditional home remedies (herbals, essential oils, and supplements) for the prevention and management of everyday common infections -cold, flu, sore throat, earache, sinusitis, cough, and urinary tract infection. They also focused on the evidence which can build host resistance; lifestyle advice -moderate exercise, relaxation, and the use of probiotics to Providing help build self-confidence in using such approaches where antibiotics are not appropriate .",

To support the development and clinical evaluation of new products and services, the UK Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has invested funding of \u00a310 million through the Innovate UK, together with China Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST)'s 5 million RMB investment, to support research tackling AMR. One of the projects (CHAT-COPD) will focus on using a patented herbal remedy Shufeng Jiedu\uf0d2 to aid antibiotic use reduction in exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. This herbal remedy is also one of those preparations recommended in the recently issued Chinese National COVID-19Diagnostic and Treatment Guideline on COVID[34] -Chinese medicine for prevention of COVID-19 was issued in 23 provinces early on in the pandemic[35].",
