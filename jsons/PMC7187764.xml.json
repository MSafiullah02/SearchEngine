This infectious respiratory disease was first detected in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. It was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, and has currently infected over two million people worldwide and has killed over 150,000 people. Globally, responses have been swift and in full influenza pandemic control mode [2]. Travel and movement restrictions to curtail spread both within and across cities are in force. Many cities around the world are in lockdown or lock-in mode. Some have issued dusk-to-dawn curfews. In other scenarios, large gatherings have either been banned or discouraged. Estimates suggest that this pandemic can claim the lives of as many as 40 million people globally [3]. The Spanish flu, which lasted between 1918 and 1920 in some places, has been estimated to have cost the lives of 21-50 million people globally [4]. Evidence suggests that influenzas can mainly be spread through large clusters [5]. The WHO global influenza preparedness plan presents guidelines for the management and control of influenza and other disease [6]. Nigeria, one of the countries that adopts WHO guidelines, has over 493 cases of COVID-19 as of April 17, 2020, with 17 mortalities. This is a substantial increase since the index case was reported on February 27, 2020. To better manage the spread, Nigeria\u2019s federal government has declared a lockdown in key affected states (ie, Lagos, Ogun, and the Federal Capital Territory). The lockdown was in addition to several mitigating actions by state governments, ranging from a ban on social gatherings to dusk-to-dawn curfews. During the lockdown, schools, markets, churches, mosques, banks, offices, parks, motor parks, and airports remain closed, often for a 14-day period.",

These measures include antiviral, vaccine, and nonpharmaceutical measures such as case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, and travel restrictions. Given the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, nonpharmaceutical actions appear to be the only practical and logical option in the absence of any known antiviral drug or vaccine. Resources are stretched even in countries with advanced health care systems, as seen in Italy, the United Kingdom, China, and the United States [9,10].",

Given the inadequacy of testing kits, it is believed that the number of confirmed cases may be far lower than the actual number of cases in Nigeria and most African countries. This is fueling speculations of a real, catastrophic-level pandemic if isolation, containment, quarantine, and contact-tracing mechanisms are not urgently implemented. In a country with an already weak health care system occasioned by poor health investment choices, managing such an outbreak will become impossible.",

The adoption of digital solutions in Nigeria has been focused on electronic forms for contact data collection and visualization for follow-up [13]. Digital technologies can do more than be a tool for field data collection or serve as an outbreak investigation platform. Data on households and general population movement patterns can be extracted through digital technologies [14]. Farrahi et al [15] showed that over a 9-month period, 72 participants made 10,992 phone calls and 9432 SMS records representing communication flow; additionally, these participants made 1,973,547 Bluetooth interactions representing physical proximity movements. When extrapolated for three cases in Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria, their movement can result in thousands of interactions. In the case of an infection, these three cases can initiate an exponential number of contacts through these interactions, as seen in Figure 1A. The registered quarantine address can be visualized on the map and movement of quarantine subjects can be monitored with notifications enabled (Figure 1B).",

Many countries are currently using mobile data for a more rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic [18,19]. There has been a 90% increase in the number of countries implementing digital tracking measures and a 100% increase in reports of censorship [20]. These approaches range from the use of anonymized aggregate data to monitor the general mobility of people and track the mobile phones of confirmed cases to tracking suspected patients and their contacts. In some cases, these approaches were individualized and mandatory while, in others, they were aggregated and anonymized. In all cases, there were collaborations between the government, mobile network operators (MNOs), and other data controllers such as technology companies and financial services providers.",

Therefore, data on case isolation and quarantine should be a significant priority in Nigeria. Moreover, data is useful in modeling disease transmission.

The use of CDRs has been proven to be effective in detecting outbreak clusters, followed by the use of other frontline data collection tools for mitigating impact and containment [14]. A key limitation of using CDRs from MNOs is that for basic 2G (second generation) phone users, the location will rely on mobile network phone mast location triangulation only. This approach alone has a proximity accuracy of 50-300 meters. This accuracy level is not sufficient to identify persons who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient since the WHO contact definition prescribes two meters [7].
