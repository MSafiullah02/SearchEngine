            "text": "The mission of this chapter is to introduce the concept of epidemic outbursts in network structures, especially in case of scale-free networks. The invasion phenomena of epidemics have been of tremendous interest among the scientific community over many years, due to its large scale implementation in real world networks. This chapter seeks to make readers understand the critical issues involved in epidemics such as propagation, spread and their combat which can be further used to design synthetic and robust network architectures. The primary concern in this chapter focuses on the concept of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) models with their implementation in scalefree networks, followed by developing strategies for identifying the damage caused in the network. The relevance of this chapter can be understood when methods discussed in this chapter could be related to contemporary networks for improving their performance in terms of robustness. The patterns by which epidemics spread through groups are determined by the properties of the pathogen carrying it, length of its infectious period, its severity as well as by network structures within the population. Thus, accurately modeling the underlying network is crucial to understand the spread as well as prevention of an epidemic. Moreover, implementing immunization strategies helps control and terminate theses epidemics.",

Moreover, as highly connected individuals are of more importance considering disease transmission, incorporating them into the current network is of outmost importance [4] . This is essential in case of capturing the complexities of disease spread. Architecturally, scale-free networks are heterogenous in nature and can be dynamically constructed by adding new individuals to the current network structure one at a time. This strategy is similar to naturally forming links, especially in case of social networks. Moreover, the newly connected nodes or individuals link to the already existent ones (with larger connections) in a manner that is preferential in nature. This connectivity can be understood by a power-law plot with the number of contacts per individual, a property which is regularly observed in case of several other networks like that of power grids, world-wide-web, to name a few [14] .",

Highly connected individuals as well as hub participants have played essential roles in the spread and maintenance of infections and diseases. Figure 1 .1 illustrates the architecture of a system consisting of a population of individuals. It has several essential components, namely, nodes, links, newly connected nodes, hubs and sub-groups respectively. Here, nodes correspond to individuals and their relations are shown as links. Similarly, newly connected nodes correspond to those which are recently added to the network, such as initiation of new relations between already existing and unknown individuals [24] . Hubs are Fig. 1.1 A synthetic scale-free network and its characteristics those nodes which are highly connected, such as individuals who are very popular among others and have many relations and/or friends. Lastly, sub-groups correspond to certain sections of the population which have individuals with closely associated relationships, such as group of nodes which are highly dense in nature, or having high clustering coefficient. Furthermore, it is important in having large number of contacts as the individuals are at greater risk of infection and, once infected, can transmit it to others. For instance, hub individuals of such high-risk individuals help in maintaining sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in different populations where majority belong to long-term monogamous relationships, whereas in case of SARS epidemic, a significant proportion of all infections are due to high risk connected individuals. Furthermore, the preferential attachment model proposed by Barab\u00e1si and Albert [4] defined the existence of individuals of having large connectivity does not require random vaccination for preventing epidemics. Moreover, if there is an upper limit on the connectivity of individuals, random immunization can be performed to control infection.",

Watts and Strogatz on the other hand demonstrated that various real-world networks have a smaller average shortest path length along with high clustering coefficient greater than expected randomly. It has been observed that it is difficult to block and/or terminate an epidemic in scale-free networks with slow tails. It has especially been seen in case the network correlations among infections and individuals are absent.

Similarly, in case of complex networks, determination of topological characteristics has shown that these are scale-free as well as highly clustered, but do not display small-world features. Also, by mapping a standard Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to a percolation problem, one can also find that there exists certain finite epidemic threshold. In certain cases, the transmission rate needs to exceed a critical value for the infection to spread and prevail. This also specifies that the fractal networks are robust to infections [11] .

Likewise, in case of epidemiological networks, connections are included if they explain relationships capable of permitting the transfer of infection. But, in most of the cases, clarity of defining such relations is absent. Thus, various types of relationships bestow risks and judgments that needs to be sorted for understanding likely transmission routes. One can also consider weighted networks in which links are not merely present or absent but are given scores or weights according to their strength [9] . Furthermore, different infections are passed by different routes, and a mixing network is infection specific. For instance, a network used in HIV transmission is different from the one used to examine influenza. Similarly, in case of airborne infections like influenza and measles, various networks need to be considered because differing levels of interaction are required to constitute a contact.

Similarly, the herd immunity is the proportion of population immune to a particular infection.

Also, we explained how determining the complete nature of a network required knowledge of every individual in a population and their relationships as, the problems with network definition and measurement depend on the assumptions of data collection processes.

In interconnected networks, failure in vertex links in one network can cause failure of dependent vertices in other networks. This results in cascading failures. Similarly, in case of networks without dependencies among vertices, the level of information flow between the interconnected vertices affects the epidemic transition on subset levels. Furthermore, percolation threshold in interacting networks are lower than in single networks, with the appearance of a giant component in certain cases (Fig. 1.5). A giant component is a connected sub-graph of a random graph containing a constant fraction of total vertices of the entire graph. These are extremely prominent in Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs, where each edge connecting vertex pairs for a set of n vertices remains independently of one another with a probability p. Here, if p \u2264 1\u2212\u03b5 n for any constant \u03b5 > 0, then all the connected components have size O(logn), and giant component is absent. But, for p \u2265 1+\u03b5 n a single giant component may reside. Figure 1.5a-d illustrate the formation of a giant component in a random graph with p = 0.002, 0.006, 0.009 in",
