Most of these deaths are attributable to the virulence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, but some may have been due to pandemic-associated surges that strain hospital capacity, defined as the ability of a hospital to deliver high-quality care to all who need it at a given time (1) . In addition, underresourced health systems pose a threat not just to patient care, but also to the safety and well-being of health care workers. Thus, clinical operations leaders face significant uncertainty in making optimal decisions about staffing, bed expansions, ventilator purchase and repurposing, testing resources and strategies, personal protective equipment, elective procedures, visitation rules, and other resources.",

Here, we report the operational dilemmas faced by our healthcare system leadership that motivated the construction of CHIME, the methods and assumptions behind the implementation of this SIR model, and how the interface was crafted and used to empower health system leaders to make decisions based on different scenarios under varying assumptions.

Because epidemic dynamics are sensitive to quarantine policies, testing availability, and other local factors, we constructed an interface to enable users to understand how variations in these parameters affect case projections. Although informed by similar explorations of epidemic trajectories in other settings worldwide (10 -13), our CHIME tool was explicitly designed to be usable by and responsive to the needs of clinical operations leaders. Exploring local epidemic scenarios over a range of assumptions provided upper and lower bounds for predicted demands on health system capacity, as well as the time available to prepare to meet those demands.",

We could not reliably estimate the extent to which such policies as canceling elective admissions and surgeries would reduce demand among patients with other indications for hospitalization, so we chose to model demand only among patients with COVID-19.

Clinicians and clinician-researchers provided the model developers on the data science team with insight into the model inputs and assumptions most subject to variation or inaccuracy and provided adequate ranges of plausible estimates. Through a series of discussions and iterative development of the Web-based tool, CHIME was developed to be as simple as possible while providing actionable information for high-stakes decisions in preparing for the expected COVID-19 epidemic in our region.",

By specifying values of initial disease prevalence, population size, time to recovery, and transmission rate, the SIR model makes deterministic predictions about the number of future infections over time. First, on the basis of published case series from China and other regions reporting on the clinical course of observed patients early in the epidemic (15) (16) (17) (18) and local information about the regional population ( Table 1) served at the 3 hospitals in our health system, we used the SIR framework to model the number and rate of infections in the regional population. Next, we extended these projections of the total number of cases to estimate the proportion of patients with COVID-19 Internal data Currently known regional infections, n who would require hospital resources (hospitalizations, ICU care, invasive mechanical ventilation). We then conducted a Monte Carlo simulation instantiation of an SIR model with a 1-day cycle with 1000 draws from probability distributions of model parameters. The Supplement (available at Annals.org) provides the details of the equations and parameters underlying the CHIME SIR model.",

Such early action is clearly superior for pandemic preparedness and response, but absent such projections, may only have been recognized in hindsight.

The CHIME-forecasted peak occurred at nearly the same day as that of the Goh model, but much earlier than the Hill model, and included a much larger number of infections than both models. Possible reasons for these differences include the impossibility of aligning input parameters exactly across models, and the fact that both external models incorporated an additional transition state =E to describe exposed populations who were not yet symptomatic and separate states to account for differential severity of infection. Thus, generating estimates using multiple models may help clinical leaders properly account for uncertainty in all forecasts.",

            "text": "Our study has limitations. First, the SIR model itself is a simplified epidemic model that does not account for the structure of contact networks and resultant transmission. This may be particularly important in the case of COVID-19, because of rapidly shifting regional policies on physical distancing, school and university closures, cancellation of public gatherings, and shelterin-place advisories. Although we could not account for these dynamics directly in the model itself, differences in rates of interpersonal contact and disease transmission attributable to physical distancing policies were indirectly modeled through the broad range of doubling times used in our sensitivity analyses. In particular, the mass action mixing assumption in CHIME, in which all members of the population are assumed to mix homogeneously with each other, may overestimate the final size of the epidemic (26) as well as produce a steeper decline in cases after peak (27) . Second, this model accounted for hospital demand due only to patients with COVID-19 presenting to 3 hospitals in our health system. Modeling only the needs for patients with COVID-19 would cause these projections to underestimate the total true demand on health system resources. However, other phenomena may cause our approach to over-or underestimate the true demand, including the possibility of different regional outbreaks of COVID-19, varying demand for non-COVID-19-related hospital services with elimination of elective cases, and disruption of usual outpatient care for patients with acute and chronic illnesses. We also expect that the role of suburban hospitals may change as they manage local cases of COVID-19 in less densely populated areas or serve as a reservoir of ICU capacity as regionalization policies seek to offload strain from urban hospitals. These uncertainties will be incorporated into subsequent versions of CHIME as epidemic patterns and local care practices emerge in the coming weeks.",

We did, however, explore the full range of published parameters through simulation and provided estimates of uncertainty to guide decision making. We will also continue to use data that accrue on the local level to inform iterative model revisions. In addition, we plan to validate the model projections presented here to inform hospital planning strategies in the event of future epidemics. Each day, we will update timevarying parameters, such as the number of cases reported by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the number of infected patients within our health system, to make predictions about future hospital demand at 7-, 14-, 28-, and 56-day time horizons. As we monitor the epidemic progress in real time, including expected changes in the doubling time, we will then assess the performance of these predictions for hospital, ICU bed, and ventilator demand, at each week by using the mean-squared error. Fourth, the model does not distinguish between patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection and those who died of it. Although this distinction probably has only a small impact on forecasting shortterm hospital needs, it may have considerable importance for forecasting post-acute care needs, future hospital needs, and overall population health. Thus, CHIME should not be used for estimating the latter types of needs. As more data are gathered on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic, it will become more feasible to parameterize increasingly complex models to account for immunity, exposure periods, and death (28 -30).
