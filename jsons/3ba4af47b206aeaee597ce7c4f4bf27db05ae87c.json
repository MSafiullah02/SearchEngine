By examining the effects of virus infection on gene expression, and interactions between virus and vector, new targets for prevention of infection and novel treatments may be identified in mosquitoes. We previously performed a microarray analysis of the Aedes aegypti transcriptome during infection with DENV and found that mosquito ubiquitin protein Ub3881 (AAEL003881) was specifically and highly down-regulated. Ubiquitin proteins have multiple functions in insects, including marking proteins for proteasomal degradation, regulating apoptosis and mediating innate immune signaling. Methods: We used qRT-PCR to quantify gene expression and infection, and RNAi to reduce Ub3881 expression. Mosquitoes were infected with DENV through blood feeding. We transfected DENV protein expression constructs to examine the effect of Ub3881 on protein degradation. We used site-directed mutagenesis and transfection to determine what amino acids are involved in Ub3881-mediated protein degradation. Immunofluorescence, Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting were used to examine protein interactions and co-localization. Results: The overexpression of Ub3881, but not related ubiquitin proteins, decreased DENV infection in mosquito cells and live Ae. aegypti. The Ub3881 protein was demonstrated to be involved in DENV envelope protein degradation and reduce the number of infectious virions released. Conclusions: We conclude that Ub3881 has several antiviral functions in the mosquito, including specific viral protein degradation.

Therefore, an siRNA molecule against a genespecific coding region of Ub3881 was used so that the inhibition of expression would be specific. We transfected the Ub3881 siRNA into Aag2 cells and infected the cells with DENV 72 h post-transfection (hpt). This timepoint was chosen after carefully examining Ub3881 knockdown at 24-168 hpt. The Ub3881 was over 80% reduced at 72 hpt and expression remained down until the 168 timepoint. At 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h post-infection (hpi), cellular RNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR for infection levels. Reduction in Ub3881 resulted in a slight increase in DENV infection in the cells (Fig. 2D) but it was not significant. Next, we used the siRNA in live Ae. aegypti to reduce the Ub3881 levels prior to DENV infection. The siRNA was intrathoracically injected according to our previous methods [16, 41] and mosquitoes were infected with DENV by blood feeding at 7 dpmi. At 5 dpi, RNA was isolated from mosquitoes for qRT-PCR analysis. We found a slight increase in DENV infection in the mosquitoes with reduced Ub3881 (Fig. 2E ) but the difference was not statistically significant. This indicated both that Ub3881 may not be inhibitory to initial virus entry and that the Ub3881 down-regulation caused by DENV infection is sufficient for successful infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1321, "end": 1325, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1329, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1111, "end": 1120, "text": "(Fig. 2D)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1553, "text": "(Fig. 2E", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "DENV infection efficiently regulates expression of Ub3881"}, {"text": "Since we found that Ub3881 may have antiviral activity, we hypothesized that the overexpression of Ub3881 would negatively impact infectious DENV production.

A different set of cells was transfected with a GFP plasmid as a control. Since we wanted to investigate the number and quality of virions produced from the cells with and without Ub3881 overexpression, we assayed the infectivity cell supernatants. First, we used the supernatant in a plaque assay on uninfected Vero cells. We found that the supernatant from Aag2 cells that were overexpressing Ub3881 resulted in a lower number of plaques than the supernatant from the control cells (Fig. 3A ). This indicated that there is less infectious virus in cells that are overexpressing Ub3881. We next used the supernatant to infect a new set of cells, both Aag2 mosquito and Huh7 human liver cells. We found that, again, the supernatant from cells that were overexpressing Ub3881 resulted in lower infection, as measured by qRT-PCR ( Fig. 3B/C) . We also measured the DENV in the supernatant from the original transfected/infected Aag2 cells to quantify DENV. We determined that there was less DENV in the supernatant from cells that had Ub3881 transfected than the supernatant from control cells (Fig. 3D ).

Thus, the suppression of DENV infection by Ub3881 might be due to the activated state of antiviral immune pathways. Ubiquitin can regulate Imd immune signaling via attachment to the Imd protein, which may result in the transcription of innate immune genes, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) [44] . In addition, the Imd pathway was recently shown to be involved in antiviral immunity in insects [45, 46] . Thus, quantification of AMP expression levels was analyzed during Ub3881 overexpression and DENV infection. Aag2 cells were transfected with Ub3881 or Ub6551 expression vectors and infected with DENV 24 hpt. Levels of AMP genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR at 48 hpi. We found that several AMP genes, including cecropin, attacin, defensin and diptericin, had significantly increased levels during DENV infection with the addition of Ub3881 overexpression, as compared to cells overexpressing Ub6551 or DENV infection alone (Fig. 4A,  Table S4 ). We hypothesized that the Ub3881-induced expression of immune genes may be signaled through the Imd pathway. Therefore, we next sought to determine if the Ub3881 directly interacted with the Aedes Imd protein. To investigate this, we used antibody against the Ae. aegypti Imd coding sequence that we had produced (Table S3 , Fig. S2 ) in an immunoprecipitation assay (IP) to pull down Ub3881 binding partners from whole Ae. aegypti lysates.

To confirm that there was an interaction between Ub3881 and mosquito Imd protein, we used the antibodies we had made against each protein to precipitate them from DENV-infected Ae. aegypti lysates. We ran the precipitated solutions on SDS-PAGE gels and used Western blot analysis with the antibody against Ub3881.

Control cells were transfected with GFP plasmid. Infection levels were analyzed using isolated RNA and qRT-PCR analysis. MG132 has successfully been used to inhibit the proteasome in insect cells previously [52] and we found no cellular toxicity in our assays at the levels used.

To confirm that virus release also remained reduced with overexpression of Ub3881 during proteasomal inhibition, we also measured DENV in the supernatant by qRT-PCR. We found that MG132 did not stop Ub3881 from inhibiting DENV virus production in the cells (Fig. 5C ). We next examined whether Ub3881 interacts with the 26S proteasome to determine if this ubiquitin is involved in the mosquito proteasome pathway. We looked at the association between the proteasome and Ub3881 in Aag2 cells with and without DENV infection using polyclonal antibodies that we had made against Ub3881 and antibodies recognizing the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome. Cells were then examined by fluorescence microscopy and co-localization of Ub3881 and the proteasome was seen both with and without DENV infection (Fig. 5D ).

To investigate this, we overexpressed Ub3881 in Aag2 cells, infected the cells with DENV and performed Western blot analysis on cell lysates to detect levels of individual DENV proteins. The cells expressing Ub3881 had much lower levels of all viral proteins than the control cells (Fig. 6A) , which suggested that the Ub3881 protein was indeed degrading viral proteins. However, since the overexpression of Ub3881 impairs viral infection, it is possible that the protein levels were lower due to a reduction in viral RNA rather than via protein degradation. To address this, we expressed Ub3881 in Aag2 cells and then separately transfected plasmids expressing each of the individual DENV proteins. We performed Western blot analysis on the cell lysates to measure viral protein levels. This time, the levels of most DENV proteins did not change with increased Ub3881 expression, with the exception of the envelope (E) protein (Fig. 6B ). This indicated that the Ub3881 may be specifically targeting E for degradation, which could be one of the main antiviral mechanisms. This also supports that levels of other viral proteins were low due to the reduced viral RNA levels rather than proteasomal degradation. Looking at the sequence of DENV E, we found that there are 3 putative ubiquitination sites within the sequence at lysines K88, K157 and K163 (Fig. S4) , which indicates that the ubiquitination of DENV E by Ub3881 is likely.

Ubiquitin proteins and the proteasome system have been known to be required for many stages in a number of viral lifecycles, and have been shown to play both pro-and antiviral roles. Viruses employ several strategies that require host ubiquitin to evade immune system surveillance, undergo replication, for budding, and viral maturation [29, 31, 32, 34] . For example, human cytomegalovirus inhibits MHC antigen presentation through the dislocation of MHC class I from the endoplasmic reticulum. The now cytoplasmic MHC-1 becomes polyubiquitinated and is promptly removed for proteasome degradation [36] . This process known as ubiquitin-dependent ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is typically used to clean up and remove misfolded proteins from the ER [53] , and has also been shown to play a role during WNV infection [27] . During Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a ubiquitin ligase may mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of the core protein [54] , which is notable in light of our findings that the mosquito Ub3881 can bind and mark DENV envelope protein for degradation.

Generally speaking, K63-linked ubiquitination is involved in signaling and the regulation of kinase activation while ubiquitin chains linked through lysine 6, 11, 27, 29, 33 or 48 usually target a substrate protein for proteasomal degradation [62, 63] . Linear ubiquitin chains linked via the N-terminal amino group can also play important nonproteolytic functions. We found that the mosquito ubiquitin Ub3881 has lysines at position 6, 27, 29 and 48 but not K11, K33 or K63. In addition, an inserted alanine at position 19 shifts the position of the downstream lysines by one position. As Ub3881 does not have a lysine at position 63 but does have K48, we hypothesized that the protein may likely be acting to target proteins for degradation through the proteasome rather than participating in cell signaling or protein delivery to endosomal-lysosomal pathways [64] . We found that the Ub3881 was in fact acting to label the dengue virus envelope protein for degradation. Whether any monoubiquitination of dengue viral envelope protein can lead to relocation or protein interactions within an infected cell remains to be investigated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 223, "end": 227, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 478, "end": 481, "text": "63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1096, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The Imd pathway is an innate immune response in insects that can stimulate the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and is rapidly triggered during bacterial infection in Drosophila by a peptidoglycan in the cell wall of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria [65, 66] . Interestingly, the Imd pathway is also protective against some RNA viruses, though it is not entirely clear how viruses prompt the Imd pathway and in what way Imd establishes resistance in return [66] . In Drosophila, a polyubiquitin chain linked via K63 has been found to recruit and activate the TAK1-TAB2 complex which then further activates sections of the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway [65, 66] . The mosquito Ub3881 does not have a lysine at positon 63 that would be suggestive of an involvement in cell signaling or immune response. In spite of this, we found that Ub3881 associated with Ae. aegypti Imd protein, and increased amounts of Ub3881 resulted in increased AMP signaling. Perhaps ubiquitination via a lysine other than K63 may be the mechanism behind the Ub3881 and Imd interaction and resulting AMP gene expression during DENV infection. Further investigation into which lysine residue may be involved in the various functions of Ub3881, especially with regard to dengue virus infection, is an anticipated future direction. Another component of the insect Imd pathway is the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), which blocks caspases from the initiation of cell apoptosis and can activate the innate immune system through polyubiquitination [65] . We found that that increased amounts of mosquito Ub3881 caused increased apoptosis, especially in cells infected by DENV. We also saw that the reduction of Ub3881 during DENV infection resulted in a reduction in apoptosis. This may suggest an intriguing role for Ub3881 in cell death during DENV infection. It is interesting to speculate that the increased apoptosis could result from ubiquitination of IAP by Ub3881, though the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not entirely clear as of yet. If the Ub3881 blocks mosquito Relish activity, this may also result in apoptosis, as Relish is the insect form of NFKB and an increase in NFKB activity in mammalian cells may result in decreased apoptosis [67] .

This suggests that Ub3881 may not be inhibitory to DENV early in infection or that the repressive effects DENV has on Ub3881 expression could be sufficient to negate the antiviral effect. As lowering Ub3881 levels before infection didn't have any benefit for DENV infection levels, one reason could be that there is no involvement of the protein during early steps such as attachment and entry, but rather that Ub3881 plays a role during replication, assembly or budding. Once DENV proteins are made, they likely act quickly and efficiently to reduce expression of Ub3881 to levels that are optimal for the later steps in infection. The reduction of almost 100-food at one timeout during virus infection as well as the devastating effects on infection due to Ub3881 overexpression both indicate that this mosquito protein is extremely harmful to the DENV life cycle. The lack of benefit from additional knock down could also indicate that the virus may have evolved its mechanisms of host manipulation rather perfectly. The action of DENV on Ub3881 expression might be enough to prevent any antiviral effects. The loss of Ub3881 function did reduce the level of apoptosis during DENV infection, which again points to a role for Ub3881 in apoptosis of the mosquito cells during infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This investigation revealed that Ub3881 plays an important role during DENV infection in the mosquito, targeting DENV E for destruction and reducing the production of quality infectious virions. The reduction in quality infectious virions is likely directly linked to the low availability of envelope protein during Ub3881 overexpression, as newly produced virus requires a specific amount of DENV E. The Ub3881 protein may also function as part of the innate immune response against flaviviruses. The targeting of DENV E for degradation and increased AMP expression are both ways in which the viral life cycle would benefit from the down-regulation of Ub3881 during infection. The data presented here adds to our knowledge of dengue virus pathogenesis in the mosquito transmission vector. Although a traditional vaccine for DENV may soon be licensed for use by many nations, and the Sanofi Pasteur vaccine is currently licensed for use in Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines [68, 69] , additional strategies involving the elimination of infection in the transmission vector could serve as strong complement vaccine approaches. Understanding the effects of dengue infection on the mosquito, responses both common and unique to individual flaviviruses, will aid in developing broadly applicable methods to treat and prevent infection of the mosquito vector in hopes of stopping virus spread before human transmission. In future studies, we aim to further examine the ubiquitination of the dengue viral envelope protein as well as the putative binding of Ub3881 to mosquito IAP during cellular apoptosis.
