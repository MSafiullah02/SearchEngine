The disease spread along international air travel routes to Hanoi, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto during February and March 2003 [1] . Chains of secondary community transmission subsequently occurred in hospital settings, affecting doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who were initially unaware of the new disease and its mode of transmission. Although close contact was usually linked to viral transmission, cases were also observed after only incidental exposure [2] .",

After the initial development of nonspecific symptoms, the disease often progressed to severe lower respiratory disease requiring hospitalization and intensive care, with a high casefatality rate. Predictors of mortality were shown to be advancing age (150% case-fatality in those \u044360 years of age), underlying chronic illness, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase concentration or white blood cell count at presentation [3] [4] [5] [6] . Lung pathology specimens revealed hemophagocytosis and giant cells of macrophage origin, suggesting that the immune system plays an important role in pathogenesis [6, 7] . As a result, corticosteroids, in combination with ribavirin, were often administered as treatment, albeit with limited or no perceived benefit [8, 9] . On 12 March 2003 , the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert on SARS. With support from the WHO and other members of the international health community, authorities in affected regions implemented intense epidemiologic surveillance, rigorous adherence to infection-control procedures, strict practices of patient isolation, rigorous application of quarantine for asymptomatic contacts, and aggressive restrictions on travel. As a consequence of this international effort, SARS outbreaks were contained by mid-July. The cumulative impact was limited to 8098 probable SARS cases, with 774 fatalities [10] .",

To help coordinate the robust research response needed to address the multidimensional SARS threat, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) convened a colloquium entitled SARS: Developing a Research Response on 30 May 2003 on the National Institutes of Health campus. Participants included 1500 physicians, scientists, and policymakers from the United States, Canada, China, Europe, and elsewhere. The program was designed to facilitate interaction among participants in 5 areas of interest: SARS clinical research, epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The following 5 sections, with corresponding tables, represent the highlights of the discussions that took place on each of these topics. We conclude with a discussion of recent progress in SARS research and an assessment of what research needs remain to be addressed.",

For example, a single amino acid change in the S, or \"spike,\" protein changes transmissible gastroenteritis virus from a predominantly respiratory pathogen into an intestinal pathogen [12] . For this reason, evaluation of viral quasi species obtained from different tissues, obtained from patients with different clinical manifestations of SARS, and obtained over time from single patients could be very rewarding. Error rates during transcription by coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are typically on the order of 1 in 10 4 , which are similar to rates for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Such high rates will likely cause substantial variation in the viral genome to occur over time, which could permit drug-resistant isolates to emerge. Careful surveillance for the development of drug-resistant SARS strains should, therefore, be part of any antiviral research protocol.",

The initial SARS cases in Guangdong Province occurred among workers in food preparation and the restaurant industry, which suggests that practices associated with live-animal markets in this region were a source of human infections [13] . Moreover, some workers in live-animal markets in Shenzhen, China, showed serologic evidence of SARS CoV infection without a history of a SARS-like illness. Virologic surveillance in live-animal markets led to the isolation of coronaviruses closely related to SARS CoV. Further study of the genetic diversity of related coronaviruses in a broad range of wild and domestic animals may help to identify potential animal reservoirs of SARS CoV, as well as virologic and environmental characteristics that favor zoonotic transmission. Natural history. Little is known about the natural history of SARS CoV infection. It is also critical that the reproductive rate (R o ) be quantified in different subpopulations, settings, and climates. Initial estimates suggest that R o is \u223c3, considerably less than for highly transmissible viruses, such as influenza virus. R o may change seasonally, and a relatively small change may determine whether the virus becomes established in the human population. Moreover, the effect of host factors, especially age, on viral transmission remains to be clarified. Children infected with SARS CoV experience much less severe illness, whereas people 160 years of age suffer severe disease and high mortality; however, it is not yet clear how the probability of viral transmission varies among age groups. Similarly, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection, the possibility of transmission through an oral-fecal route or through blood transfusion, and the presence of host genetic factors that affect susceptibility have yet to be determined. Finally, the viral, host, and environmental factors that caused so-called \"super-spreader\" incidents, in which many people are infected by a single individual, should be elucidated as quickly as possible. Infection-control strategies. Currently, the only available strategy for the control of SARS is isolation and quarantine. Because these procedures will be needed to address SARS and other emerging infectious agents, the social and psychological consequences of isolation and quarantine should be studied, and incentives for people to adhere to implemented policies should be assessed. The efficacy of other infection-control techniques, such as screening for febrile passengers in airports, should also be examined.",

Working collaboratively, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, the NIAID, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established a SARS antiviral drug-screening laboratory in March 2003. The assay used at that laboratory measured how much candidate compounds inhibit cytopathic effects of SARS CoV growing in cultured Vero cells. Initially, the antiviral drugs screened included those that are US Food and Drug Administration approved, those in clinical development, and those for which preclinical data suggested activity against a potential viral target protein. Some in vitro activity against SARS CoV was observed with certain preparations of interferon-a and -b, as well as with rimantadine at high concentrations and a cysteine protease inhibitor. Antiviral drug design. Molecular virologic and genetic studies of SARS CoV and other coronaviruses suggest several possible molecular targets for antiviral drugs. These include viral binding, fusion, and other activities mediated by the glycoprotein spike on the coronavirus surface, as well as the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the papain-like cysteine protease, and the chymotrypsin-picornavirus 3C-like protease. Inhibitors of surface hemagglutinin-esterase or other activities involved in release of virus from cell surfaces may also represent a class of useful antiviral drugs.

Experience to date indicates that the immune response might play a role in SARS pathogenesis, which has important implications for both treatment and vaccine development. It is encouraging that useful vaccines for some animal coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus, have been developed using various strategies, including live-attenuated, whole-killed, and subunit approaches.

Existing [17] reported that real-time PCR, coupled with an improved RNA extraction method, allows detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates with 80% specificity, a considerable improvement over first-generation procedures. This research was made possible by the availability of a set of well-characterized clinical samples from individuals with confirmed SARS, coupled with matched controls. Rigorous testing of diagnostic procedures using standardized samples remains a challenge to the international community, however. In addition, a more complete understanding of where in the body the virus can be found at different stages of the disease might lead to new diagnostic strategies. For example, the report that SARS CoV can replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in individuals with SARS shortly after the onset of symptoms indicates that blood might be an appropriate clinical specimen for diagnosis [18, 19] . Availability of a highly accurate and specific diagnostic assay that could detect SARS CoV before or shortly after the onset of symptoms would be a tremendously valuable public health tool in any future SARS outbreaks [20] . SARS pathogenesis and immune response. A complete understanding of SARS pathogenesis, together with a full picture of the human immune response, has not yet been achieved. In this regard, it is particularly important to understand what role, if any, the human immune response plays in severe disease outcomes. A recent report describing changes in cytokine concentrations in 61 patients seropositive for SARS CoV in Beijing at early, peak, and recovery stages of the disease indicates that the immune system responds abnormally to the virus [21] . This is the kind of study that can provide useful insights into both pathogenic mechanisms and the effectiveness of experimental therapies. Another report indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for SARS CoV [22] . Further work to systematically unravel all aspects of how SARS CoV interacts with its human host at the molecular and physiologic levels will help ensure rapid development of therapeutic techniques, diagnostic assays, and vaccines. SARS animal models. It has been shown that the virus will replicate in several small animals, including masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, mice, domestic cats, and nonhuman primates; researchers have a variety of animal models from which to choose. The development of vaccines and therapeutic strategies will rely on several different models, because each will have advantages in different experimental settings. However, no animal model described to date can reliably mimic the respiratory symptoms seen in humans with SARS. A recent report indicates that SARS-infected ferrets become ill, although these animals show no evidence of pneumonia [23] . Follow-up work on these and other animals might lead to the discovery of an animal model that reproduces SARS symptoms in humans.",
