            "text": "This chapter reviews the development of inhibitors of viral proteases. A major focus will be on inhibitors of the HIV-1 protease, because this target has seen the greatest amount of work, and many of the biological lessons learned are directly applicable to other viral systems. A major limitation in antiviral therapy is the development of inhibitor resistance, and this topic will also be considered, while a more general review on antiviral resistance also referring to protease inhibitors is provided in Chap. 11 of this book. Space does not permit comprehensive referencing; therefore, we cite seminal initial reports, refer to comprehensive review articles, and discuss the more recently published literature. Finally, although many viruses encode essential proteases, we focus on viruses where drug development either has or is likely to progress to the clinic. Viral proteases are part of a common strategy of the synthesis of large precursor proteins that are cleaved to generate mature active proteins. Most viral proteases are derived from well-known eukaryotic protease families, but have evolved their own specificities. Thus, the catalytic mechanisms of peptide bond cleavage follow well known chemistry catalyzed by canonical active site residues, but the specificity of the site of cleavage is determined by interactions between the protease and the amino acid side chains that flank the site of cleavage (i.e., the scissile bond). Drug design takes advantage of the known features of the catalytic mechanism and adds specificity based on the flanking interactions, guided in part by structural information. Given this starting point, the design of protease inhibitors has typically proceeded through the large-scale screening of substrate-like molecules.",

At the other extreme is the treatment of human rhinovirus (i.e., the cold virus), where short-term treatment to blunt viremia will likely be sufficient to reduce the unwanted symptoms of a cold. In all cases, viral proteases represent very attractive targets with familiar mechanisms of catalysis that frequently allow for the design of transition state analogs and with distinct specificities from host proteases.",

The protease is encoded in the viral pro gene, located downstream of the gag gene and upstream of the pol gene, which encodes the viral polymerase and integrase. It is expressed as part of a large polyprotein precursor, the Gag-Pro-Pol precursor. Given the dimeric nature of the viral protease, it is clear that this Gag-Pro-Pol precursor must dimerize to allow the protease to become active. The details of how the protease excises itself from the precursor are poorly understood, although the initial cleavage appears to occur in cis at a novel cleavage site (Pettit et al. 2004) .",

The active site is formed at the dimer interface, with the two aspartic acids located at the base of the active site. The enzymatic mechanism is thought to be a classic acid-base catalysis involving a water molecule and what is called a \"push-pull\" mechanism. The water molecule is thought to transfer a proton to the dyad of the carboxyl groups of the aspartic acids, and then a proton from the dyad is transferred to the peptide bond that is being cleaved. In this mechanism, a tetrahedral intermediate transiently exists, which is nonconvalent and which is mimicked in most of the currently used FDA approved inhibitors.",

            "text": "The protease cleaves the Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins at ten sites. The enzyme recognizes a series of eight residues as a substrate cleavage site, ranging from P4-P4 . Nearly 1, 000\u00c5 2 of the substrate is buried within the active site (Prabu-Jeyabalan et al. 2002) . The sequences of these ten substrate sites are quite diverse and are cleaved with different efficiencies. Most of the substrate sites have a branched amino acid residue at the P2 site, a hydrophobic residues at P1, and an aromatic or proline at P1 . However, there are exceptions to each of these patterns: the nucleocapsid-p1 cleavage site (which is the last and slowest site to be cleaved in the processing of Gag) has an alanine at P2 and an asparagine at P1. The different substrate sequences result in cleavage rates, with nearly 400-fold differences in cleavage efficiencies. These differences in rates coupled together with the threedimensional topology of the polyproteins likely contribute to the sequential order in which the substrates are cleaved. Crystallographic studies imply that although little sequence homology exists between the different protease cleavage sites, what is conserved is the shape that they adopt within the active site of the enzyme (Prabu-Jeyabalan et al. 2002) . This shape has been termed the \"substrate envelope\" and represents the consensus volume overlapping the majority of the substrates. Most likely, HIV-1 protease recognizes a particular peptide sequence as being a substrate by a combination of accessibility and the shape the sequence can adopt.",

Potential lead compounds were cocrystallized in complex with the enzyme and new compounds were designed to better fit and complement interactions within the active site. In the race to develop HIV-1 PI, competing laboratories would cocrystallize compounds that their competitors patented in order to figure out alternative chemical scaffolds that would preserve the same contacts but with better pharmacokinetics or bioavailability. This resulted in many of the PI occupying and filling the active site in a highly overlapping manner. These inhibitors are fairly hydrophobic and generally fit into the P2-P2 region of the active site, often with a hydrophobic cyclical side chain at P1 and a fairly bulky functional group at P1 . All nine FDA-approved PI are competitive active site inhibitors that bind with affinities to the purified enzyme ranging from low nanomolar to low picomolar ( Fig. 2) (Chen et al. 1994; Kaldor Fig. 2 The three-dimensional structures of the nine currently FDA-approved HIV-1 Protease inhibitors, colored by atom-type, white-carbon, blue-nitrogen, red-oxygen, yellow-sulfur, purple-florine.

Seven of the nine inhibitors (except Tipranavir and Darunavir) are peptidomimetics that mimic the enzymatic transition state, containing a variety of noncleavable dipeptide isosteres as core scaffolds to mimic the transition state of substrate cleavage.

            "text": "The introduction of PI and the beginning of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1995 has had a profound impact on the paradigm of the treatment of HIV-1 infection: the potential to change an often progressive and fatal infection to a chronic and manageable disease. The continuing evolution of PI-based antiviral therapy has been due to numerous factors, including the ongoing need for more potent inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetics, decreased side effect profiles, and higher genetic barriers of resistance to combat multidrug resistant HIV. The nine PI compounds currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of HIV-1 infection (Fig. 2 ) are as follows: saquinavir (SQV), ritonavir (RTV), indinavir (IDV), nelfinavir (NFV), lopinavir (LPV), atazanavir (ATV), fosamprenavir (FPV), tipranavir (TPV), and darunavir (DRV). We discuss the clinical use of each of the PIs in chronological order of FDA approval. Saquinavir. SQV was first shown in vitro to have potent HIV-1 inhibition in acutely infected cells with an IC 50 in the subnanomolar range and to inhibit viral maturation in chronically infected cells at 10 nM (Craig et al. 1991 ). Subsequently, clinical trials with SQV monotherapy in HIV-1 infected men at concentrations up to 600 mg three times a day for 16 weeks resulted in a decrease in HIV-1 RNA of 80% (0.7log 10 ) (Kitchen et al. 1995) . These and other data facilitated SQV in becoming the first FDA-approved PI in December 1995. In its original formulation, SQV had a low bioavailability of 4%, due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the intestine and in the liver by cytochrome P450. Characterization of HIV-1 mutants with decreased sensitivity to SQV revealed that amino acid substitutions G48V and L90M significantly increased IC 50 concentrations by approximately 40-fold (Jacobsen et al. 1995; Turriziani et al. 1994) . Thus, the need for more potent PIs with improved pharmacokinetics and a higher genetic barrier to resistance quickly became apparent.",

RTV was derived by optimization of the pharmacokinetic properties of a series of C2 symmetry-based PIs, and in vitro studies demonstrated RTV to be a potent antiviral agent with activity against a variety of HIV-1 strains with an IC 50 of 10-40 nM (Kempf et al. 1995) . Antiretroviral activity in vivo was demonstrated over a broad range of doses, with a peak decline in HIV-1 plasma viremia of 1.2log 10 (Danner et al. 1995; Markowitz et al. 1995b) . Unfortunately, despite its inhibition of HIV-1, RTV often resulted in dose-dependent GI side effects that were frequently intolerable. These side effects are secondary to many unique features of RTV: high oral bioavailability of 80% (Kempf et al. 1995) and potent inhibition of cytochrome P450-3A4 (the most potent of all PIs) and 2D6 (Hoetelmans 1999) . The fortuitous strong inhibition of the P450-3A4 metabolism pathway resulted in a strikingly long half-life for RTV. However, another limitation of RTV monotherapy was its low genetic barrier to resistance, with mutations at codons 82 or 84 substantially reducing viral susceptibility (Markowitz et al. 1995a ). The selection of protease variants with reduced affinity for RTV is consistent with the hydrophobic interaction between RTV and the isopropyl side chain of Val 82 as observed by X-ray crystallography. Because of the ability of RTV to inhibit P450-3A4, the paradigm of PI-based therapies changed from using RTV as a single PI to \"boosting\" of other PIs with RTV to increase their half-lives (Kempf et al. 1997 ). This has become the standard and maintains prolonged blood levels of the boosted PI, increases potency, decreases the required dosage, and minimizes PI side effects. In a similar fashion, RTV boosting impacts the dosing requirements of other classes of antiviral agents, including the CCR5 coreceptor antagonist, Maraviroc.",

The many limitations of the first generation PIs (modest oral bioavailability, short plasma half-life, high binding to plasma proteins, strict dietary restrictions, and a low genetic barrier to resistance) led to the eventual discovery of LPV . In vitro studies of LPV demonstrated inhibition of wild type and mutant proteases with an IC 50 in the subnanomolar range. Furthermore, LPV, like most PIs, is exquisitely sensitive to pharmacokinetic enhancement by codosing with ritonavir, producing sustained concentrations in the plasma that are > 50-fold over the EC 50 , which has led to the coformulation LPV/RTV (Kaletra). In vivo, potent and durable viral suppression has been examined in antiretroviral na\u00efve patients receiving LPV/RTV in conjunction with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), with 85% of patients having HIV-1 viral loads \u2264 400 copies/ml at 48 weeks (Murphy et al. 2001) . In contrast to first generation PIs, Kaletra has been shown to have a much higher genetic barrier of resistance. Selection of highly resistant viral variants is due to the sequential appearance of multiple mutations, such as I84V-L10F-M46I-T91S-V32I-I47V (Carrillo et al. 1998 ). Moreover, mutations at 11 amino acid positions in protease (L10F/I/R/V, K20M/R, L24I, M46I/L, F53L, I54L/T/V, L63P, A71I/L/T/V, V82A/F/T, I84V, and L90M) are associated with reduced susceptibility, but these must appear in combinations. The median IC 50 of LPV against isolates with 0-3, 4 or 5, 6 or 7, and 8-10 of the 11 mutations is 0.8-, 2.7-, 13.5-, and 44.0-fold higher, respectively, than the IC 50 against wild-type (Kempf et al. 2001 ). The genotypic inhibitory quotient (relationship between LPV trough levels and the number of pro mutations) is the main independent predictor of response to LPV/RTV (Gonzalez de Requena et al. 2004) . To further reinforce the potency and high resistance barrier, small-scale clinical trials have shown that two-thirds of patients on Kaletra alone are capable of maintaining suppression to below the limit of detection (50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml) after 4 years of follow-up (Pulido et al. 2008) .",

In contrast to other PIs, especially when boosted with RTV, ATV has not been associated with clinically relevant dyslipidemia or insulin resistance. Other large scale, phase 3 trials have confirmed these findings and revealed noninferiority between ATV vs. a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (efavirenz) in conjunction with two NRTIs (combivir) (Squires et al. 2004) or ATV/RTV vs. LPV/RTV (Johnson 2006) .

In contrast to the previously approved PIs that are classified as peptidomimetics and transition state analogs, that is, structurally similar to the tetrahedral intermediate that forms during hydrolytic cleavage of a peptide bond of the natural substrate (Randolph and DeGoey 2004) , TPV was the first of the nonpeptidic PIs of the dihydropyrone sulfonafamide class that are structurally similar to coumadin. Initial in vitro data demonstrated that TPV was a promising candidate for further development (Poppe et al. 1997) . Further in vitro studies demonstrated potent inhibition by TPV against clinical isolates resistant to multiple PIs, due to its molecular flexibility, allowing TPV to fit into the active site of PR that has become resistant to other PIs (Plosker and Figgitt 2003; Rusconi et al. 2000) . Phase II clinical trials have shown as many as 16-20 pro mutations, including at least three PI resistance-associated mutations are needed to confer decreased susceptibility (Plosker and Figgitt 2003) . The Randomized Evaluation of Strategic Intervention in Multi-Drug Resistant Patients [RESIST 1 AND RESIST 2 trials (Cahn et al. 2006; Gathe et al. 2006) ] assessed the safety and efficacy of boosted TPV vs. other boosted PIs (LPV, SQV, APV, and IDV) in the setting of optimized background regimens.

At week 48, the proportion of patients with undetectable viral loads (\u2264 400 copies/ml) was significantly greater in the TPV arm vs. the comparator arm (30.4% vs. 13.8%, respectively, p < 0.001).",

DRV is the second nonpeptidic PI and was synthesized by replacing the tetrahydrofuranyl (THF) urethane moiety of amprenavir with a bis-THF component (Koh et al. 2003) . Additional hydrogen bonding between the bis-THF ring and the PI backbone results in activity against a broad range of clinical isolates with an IC 50 in the nanomolar range, including multidrug-resistant HIV-1. Phase IIb clinical trials [Performance of TMC114/r when evaluated in treatment experienced patients with PI resistance (POWER1 and 2)] have examined highly treatment-experienced patients randomly assigned to either DRV/RTV or comparator boosted PIs (SQV, APV, SQV, or ATV). The proportion of patients achieving viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA \u2264 400 copies/ml) was 63% vs. 19% in the DRV vs. comparator arm, respectively. Subset analyses revealed a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving DRV, who had up to eight PI resistance mutations, achieved HIV-1 viral loads \u2264 50 copies/ml at 24 weeks vs. patients receiving a comparator PI (47% vs. 25%, respectively). Viral load suppression was sustained until at least week 48, with 61% of DRV/RTV patients vs. 15% of comparator patients having viral load reductions \u2265 1 log 10 copies/ml (Clotet et al. 2007 ). Surface plasmon resonance technology has been used to analyze the unique binding kinetics of DRV and its substrate to explain the potent antiviral activity; the dissociative half-life of DRV was found to be significantly greater than other analyzed PIs (FPV, ATV, LPV, and TPV) and binding affinity of DRV was > 2 orders of magnitude higher vs. other PIs (Dierynck et al. 2007 ).",

            "text": "Although some sites such as D30N, G48V, I50V/L, V82A, V84I, and L90M are considered primary drug-resistant mutations, they occur in complex interdependent combinations with many other sites throughout the enzyme. These sites of mutation are both within and outside the active site. In addition, specific coevolution of the sequences of particular cleavage sites has become evident. The residues that are conserved appear to be primarily for enzymatic activity, or structural reasons, that is, the dimer interface, flexibility, or key glycine residues. The extensiveness of the mutational patterns in both the enzyme and the substrates indicates that this is a very plastic and adaptable target. Chapter 11 provides more detailed information about resistance development in HIV-1 antiviral therapy. At a fundamental level, mutations can confer only drug resistance if they maintain function. For HIV-1 protease, this implies that the enzyme continues to recognize and cleave its diverse set of substrate sequences permitting viral maturation. Since all the protease inhibitors are competitive active site inhibitors with the substrates, how resistance can occur without impacting substrate recognition was somewhat of a dilemma. In comparing the crystal structures of the substrate complexes with the crystal structures of the inhibitor complexes, it was found (King et al. 2004a ) that the inhibitors protruded from the \"substrate envelope\" at specific locations. The positions at which each inhibitor protruded away from the substrates and contacted HIV-1 protease corresponded very closely with the site of drug resistant mutations (King et al. 2004a; Prabu-Jeyabalan et al. 2006) . In fact, inhibitors that fit more tightly within the substrate envelope have a higher threshold for drug resistance such as APV and DRV (King et al. 2004b ). Thus, drug resistance can potentially be greatly limited by restricting the inhibitors to fit within the substrate envelope region. Testing of this as an inhibitor design strategy has been recently utilized, resulting in a number of high affinity, novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors that retain a flat binding profile to drug-resistant protease variants (Altman et al. 2008; Chellappan et al. 2007 ). However, other resistance-associated mutations exist throughout the enzyme and these likely have a role in maintaining the activity or fitness of the enzyme.",

The presence of a chymotrypsin-like serine protease was first inferred based on sequence comparisons, with its presence placed within the amino-terminal third of the NS3 protein and the C-terminal twothirds of NS3 encoding a helicase activity. This protease activity is responsible for four of the ten cleavages that occur in the large precursor protein. The immediate downstream product, NS4A, is a subunit of the protease that greatly increases the level of catalytic activity, giving rise to its name of NS3/4A. The extensive work understanding the nature of the NS3/4A protease culminated with the determination of the structure at atomic resolution (Kim et al. 1996; Love et al. 1996) . The structure confirmed the relationship to members of the chymotrypsin family, with the overall structure being a double \u03b2-barrel. One of the structures (Kim et al. 1996) included a peptide representing the NS4A cofactor. The NS4A peptide forms one of the eight \u03b2-strands that make up the N-terminal \u03b2-barrel of the NS3/4A protease whose presence helps to form the expected catalytic triad (His57, Asp81, Ser139) juxtaposed in the structure to form the active site; the structure also revealed a relatively shallow substrate binding cleft (Fig. 3) .",

The major advantage with HCV treatment compared to HIV-1 treatment is that sustained suppression of HCV can lead to the complete clearance of virus, that is, a cure. As with HIV-1 treatment, the use of several agents together gives better sustained viral response compared with the use of single agents. The current therapy of ribavirin and interferon-\u03b1 has a 70% success rate with 24 weeks of treatment in people with genotypes 2 and 3, while this treatment is successful in only 50% of subjects with genotype 1 and after 48 weeks of treatment (http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/chronichepc/). Future studies will initially combine new agents with the approved therapies (ribavirin and interferon-\u03b1); however, the use of combinations of new agents with known virusspecific targets is a major goal. Experimental evidence generated using inhibition of a replicon in a cell culture-based assay supports the use of agents with different viral targets (Wyles et al. 2007) . Important milestones will be to avoid the use of interferon-\u03b1 and to reduce the time on therapy to reach sustained viral response.",

An unresolved question is the extent to which different protease inhibitors select for the same or different resistance mutations. This question is complicated by the fact that different levels of a drug can select for different mutations, and resistance can go through different pathways giving a stochastic feature to the appearance of resistance. Cell culture selection schemes generally involve a relatively small sample size, again adding to the stochastic nature of the results, and resistance evolving in vivo may include low-level variants that are not detected but potentially available to seed the rapid outgrowth of resistant variants with a therapy switch. The lesson to date with HIV-1 protease inhibitors is that improved drug potency has been a much more effective strategy in dealing with resistance within the protease inhibitor drug class than attempts to design drugs that elicit nonoverlapping resistance patterns. Chapter 11 provides more detailed information about resistance development in HCV antiviral therapy.",

Because of the number of people at risk for Dengue Virus infection (2.5 billion), with the attendant risk of progressing to dengue hemorrhagic fever, and the lack of an available vaccine, the development of antivirals against the Dengue Virus protease is an important goal. Unlike HCV, the activating subunit of the Dengue Virus protease comes from a proteolytic fragment of the upstream protein, that is, the NS2B fragment (Arias et al. 1993; Chambers et al. 1993) . The recent crystal structure of the dengue virus protease has clarified a number of issues, especially when compared to the structure of the West Nile Virus NS2B/NS3 protease with a bound inhibitor (Erbel et al. 2006) . The protease has a similar double \u03b2-barrel structure, with the NS2B fragment contributing part of a \u03b2 sheet. In the inhibitor-bound state, the NS2B fragment has extensive contacts around the NS3 protease domain and also contributes to the substrate binding site. This more intimate interaction helps explain the profound requirement of the NS2B fragment for significant activity (Yusof et al. 2000) . A distinctive feature of the protease target cleavage site is the presence of Arg residues at both P1 and P2 (reviewed in Melino and Paci 2007) . However, the S1 subsite has a strong stacking interaction with the P1 side chain, while the interaction between P2 and S2 is based on electrostatic interactions (Erbel et al. 2006) . Given the known substrates and the catalytic mechanism, drug discovery efforts have been undertaken, although none has progressed to clinical trials (Melino and Paci 2007) .",

The protease, called assemblin, is encoded in the HCMV gene UL80 as the amino-terminal part of a precursor protein. The C-terminal domain of the precursor is the viral assembly protein and cleavage events within the precursor are required for the packaging of viral DNA (reviewed in Brignole and Gibson 2007) . The crystal structures of the HCMV protease (Chen et al. 1996; Qiu et al. 1996; Shieh et al. 1996; Tong et al. 1996) and bound to inhibitors (Khayat et al. 2003; Tong et al. 1998) have revealed a number of features of this target (reviewed in Tong 2002) . The core of the enzyme is a seven stranded \u03b2-barrel structure that represents a novel fold for a serine protease. In addition, the catalytic triad is Ser-His-His, rather than the more familiar Ser-His-Asp, and, combined with the novel fold, represent a third independent evolution of a serine protease (in addition to the trypsin and subtilisin families). The protease crystallized as a dimer, which is the active form of the enzyme (Darke et al. 1996; Margosiak et al. 1996) . However, the two active sites in the dimer are displaced from each other and dimerization appears to stabilize the structure of the active site at a distance. The structure changes further when binding substrate (by induced fit) with the substrate/inhibitor binding in an extended conformation and forming an anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet to align the scissile bond with the active site. P2 and P4 are solvent exposed while the remaining side chains from P5 \u2212 P1 interact with the protease.",

Finally, the potential for similar drug development efforts exist for other herpesviruses such as HSV-1, HSV-2, and KSHV, although little work has been done to date.

One successful design of a 3C inhibitor included an unsaturated ethyl ester to allow the formation of a covalent bond with the protease active site Cys, known as a Michael Acceptor. Using this strategy of an irreversible inhibitor, one compound, rupintrivir, was developed and showed efficacy in the setting of experimentally induced human rhinovirus infections (Hayden et al. 2003) . The ability to select for resistance to rupintrivir validated that the 3C protease was the drug target, with mutations at position 130 in the S2 subsite being the most common (Binford et al. 2007 ). However, rupintrivir failed to show efficacy in the setting of natural infection (Patick et al. 2005) . A related compound (compound 1) was identified that had significant bioavailability when taken orally, but this compound has not been taken into efficacy trials (reviewed in Patick 2006) . Limitations in the rapid identification of the infecting agent makes the development of agent-specific therapeutics a challenge, given that a number of viruses can give cold-like symptoms, which likely can be ameliorated only with early intervention.",

The zoonotic nature of the infection came with the identification of a similar virus in bats (Poon et al. 2005) , although it is possible that the bat virus passed through other animal hosts and recombined with other SARS-like coronaviruses prior to infecting humans (Hon et al. 2008) . SARS-CoV is not currently circulating in the human population; however, the mysterious appearance and rapid spread of this virus emphasized how vulnerable the human population is to such respiratory infections.

The 3CL protease contains three domains, with the two N-terminal domains comprised of a two \u03b2-barrel chymotrypsin fold, similar to trypsin/chymotrypsin and the picornavirus 3C protease. The C-terminal domain III is globular, composed of a series of \u03b1-helices, and has an unknown function. The crystal structure also confirmed earlier biochemical work that the enzyme is dimeric, with the unusual arrangement of the subunits being perpendicular to each other. Like the picornavirus 3C protease, the 3CL protease replaces the chymotrypsin active site serine with cysteine (Cys145 in the SARS 3CL protease), which along with His41 makes a catalytic dyad rather than the prototypic catalytic triad. The S1 subsite accommodates Gln, with a specific interaction with a histidine placed at the bottom of the subsite. The hydrophobic P2 side chain is accommodated in a largely hydrophobic S2 subsite. The P3 side chain, in keeping with its poor conservation, is oriented toward the solvent, and the P4 side chain must be a small amino acid to fit into the shallow S4 subsite.",

            "text": "The appearance of the SARS CoV revealed a new threat to human health. It is now clear that similar viruses, or recombinants of viruses, could emerge from a wide range of animals, analogous to the recurring introductions of influenza virus from migratory bird populations. Thus there may be some advantage to designing less potent inhibitors that have a broad spectrum against coronaviruses, since drug development is a very slow process compared with a spreading epidemic of a respiratory virus. It is likely that being able to blunt the initial acute viremia may be sufficient to provide clinical benefit. Toxicity and potency may be less critical in a short course of therapy compared to treating chronic infections like HIV-1 or HCV. The tools appear to be in place to develop 3CL protease inhibitors that will allow for more targeted clinical intervention in future outbreaks. However, challenge experiments to demonstrate efficacy are not possible, and so potency in model systems and dosing studies in healthy volunteers will likely replace the more lengthy clinical efficacy trials required of typical drugs. In this scenario, SARS CoV inhibitors would be made available during the next epidemic on a compassionate use basis.",
