As of July 14, 2014, there have been 834 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 288 deaths, (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_07_14_mers/en/), raising serious concerns over its pandemic potential [2], [3]. With bats and dromedary camels as its likely natural reservoir and intermediate transmission host, respectively [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], MERS-CoV poses a long-term threat to human health [12], [13].

            "text": "The spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV plays important roles in mediating viral entry to host cells [14]. As the first step of cell entry, a defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike proteins binds to its functional receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), on the host cell surface for viral attachment [15]. Several versions of MERS-CoV RBD fragments have been identified by different groups. These RBD fragments encompass spike residues 358-588, 367-588, 377-588, and 367-606, respectively [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Extensive studies have found that the spike RBD of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused the SARS epidemic in 2002\u20132003 [21], [22], is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding domain and an attractive subunit vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV infection [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. It is likely that the MERS-CoV RBD could also serve as a subunit vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection. Indeed, it was previously shown that some of these MERS-CoV RBD fragments are immunogenic in animals, resulting in neutralizing antibody responses [17], [18]. However, it is not clear which one of these RBD fragments represents an ideal vaccine candidate and what is the mechanism behind the potential differences in the neutralizing abilities of these RBD fragments.",

ELISA results showed that all five RBD fragments were immunogenic in mice, and induced production of IgG antibodies that specifically bind to MERS-CoV S1 protein without the fusion of Fc. Particularly, sera from mice immunized with S367-588-Fc or S377-588-Fc acquired a stronger binding to MERS-CoV S1 protein than those immunized with the other three RBD fragments, whereas the control samples from PBS-immunized mice revealed negligible binding activity (Fig. 3A), confirming the specificity of such IgG antibody response elicited by these RBD fragments.

Results from Vero E6-based micro-neutralization showed that each of the five RBD fragments was capable of inducing neutralization antibodies. Among them, S377-588-Fc induced the highest level of neutralizing antibody response on the 10th day after the third immunization (Fig. 4A). As expected, sera from PBS-immunized mice did not show neutralizing activity. Thus, S377-588-Fc has the highest neutralizing potential among the five RBD fragments. Furthermore, S377-588-Fc was used to immunize rabbits to confirm its neutralizing potential in different animal species. Vero E6-based micro-neutralization assay demonstrated that on the 10th day after the third immunization with S377-588-Fc, high titers of neutralizing antibody responses were generated in rabbits (Fig. 4B). Therefore, S377-588-Fc, the shortest among the five RBD fragments, can produce high-titer neutralizing antibody responses in both mice and rabbits, suggesting that the fragment containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV spike protein is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding domain.",

Among all of the MERS-CoV structural proteins, the spike protein, particularly its RBD, is an important target for such an effort, due to its proven ability to elicit potent neutralizing antibody response in immunized laboratory animals [33]. Indeed, recombinant RBD fragments containing residues 358-588 and 377-662 of MERS-CoV S have been shown to induce neutralizing antibody response in immunized rabbits and mice, respectively [17], [29]. Moreover, a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the full-length S protein of MERS-CoV was also proven effective in vaccinated mice to produce potent neutralizing antibodies and restricted MERS-CoV infection in vivo\n[34]. In addition to the aforementioned recombinant proteins and viral vectors, nanoparticles and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus Replicon Particles (VRPs)-expressing spike protein of MERS-CoV have also shown great potentials as MERS vaccines [35], [36].",

Our results show that the abilities of these RBD fragments to induce immune responses and neutralizing antibodies differ significantly.

It contains the receptor-binding motif (RBM, residues 484-567) (Fig. 5\n) and almost all of the major neutralizing epitopes identified in MERS-CoV RBD, many of which are specifically recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) [31], [43], [44], [45]. These epitopes are clustered on a protruding ridge in the RBM region of the RBD, and overlap with the DPP4-binding site (Fig. 5) [16], [19], [20]. Although not yet experimentally confirmed, other regions in the RBM that overlap with the DPP4-binding site may also contain neutralizing epitopes. On the other hand, the regions in the MERS-CoV spike that do not overlap with the DPP4-binding site likely contain non-neutralizing epitopes. These non-neutralizing epitopes might hinder the production of neutralizing antibodies and may also induce harmful immune responses [46], [47], [48]. The regions in the RBD core structures contribute to the folding and the stability of the whole RBD, and thus they are essential. However, the regions flanking the RBD do not contribute to protein folding or receptor binding. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the critical neutralizing epitopes in RBD in the MERS-CoV spike protein, and exclude non-neutralizing epitopes, without the expense of domain integrity and stability, as a means of \u201cimmunofocusing\u201d for vaccine development.",

            "text": "Overall, the RBD fragment encompassing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV S protein is the ideal subunit vaccine candidate with the capability of inducing strong neutralizing antibodies in different species of animals. Therefore, it can be the focus of future development of MERS vaccines. Furthermore, this study suggests that in vaccine design it maybe helpful to eliminate non-neutralizing epitopes from the RBD fragments to keep the RBD fragments in their most physiological relevant conformation, and also allow the host immune responses to focus on the neutralizing epitopes.",
