            "text": "The COVID-19 epidemic that emerged in Wuhan China at the end of 2019 hit Italy particularly hard, yielding the implementation of strict national lockdown rules (Phase 1). There is now a hot ongoing debate in Italy and abroad on what the best strategy is to restart a country to exit a national lockdown (Phase 2). Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting scenarios at the national level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other nations around the world, is divided in administrative regions who can independently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service. In this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity between regions, is essential to understand the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly, to design effective post Lock-Down strategies to control the disease. To achieve this, we model Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the model of each region on real data spanning almost two months from the initial outbreak. Using the model, we confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national lockdown strategy implemented so far by the Italian government to mitigate the spread of the disease and show its efficacy at the regional level.",

Our study and methodology can be easily extended to other levels of granularity (provinces or counties in the same region or states in other federal countries, etc.) to support policy-and decisionmakers.",

Each of Italy's twenty administrative regions is independent on Health and oversees its own share of the Italian National Health service. The regional presidents and their councils can independently take their own actions, strengthening or, at times, weakening national containment rules. Previous studies have modelled the spread of the epidemics and its evolution in the country at the national level [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , and some have looked at the effects of different types of containment and mitigation strategies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Limited work [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] has taken into account the spatial dynamics of the epidemic but, to the best of our knowledge, no previous paper in the literature has explicitly taken into consideration the pseudo-federalist nature of the Italian Republic and its strong regional heterogeneity when it comes to health matters, hospital capacity, economic costs of a lockdown and the presence of inter-regional people's flows.",

As shown in Table 1 , the estimated number of infected predicted by the model for the Campania region in the time window March 19 th -March 30 th 2020 is detected to suddenly increase at the beginning of the next time window.

As reported in Figure   2 , we found that a primary outbreak in that region would quickly propagate causing secondary recurrent outbreaks in other regions including Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont. At the national level this would cause the onset of a second epidemic wave that, if not contained, would end up afflicting more than 25% of the entire population. An even more dramatic scenario would emerge if inter-regional flows where concurrently restored to their pre-lockdown levels (see Figure S1 ) or all regions were to relax their current restrictions concurrently (see Figure S2 in the Supplementary information).",

To this aim we compared the effects of national measures (e.g., general lockdown) against those of a regional feedback strategy where social distancing measures are put in place or relaxed independently by each region according to the ratio between hospitalized individuals and the total capacity of the health system in that region. In particular, we assume each region implements a stricter lockdown when such a ratio becomes greater or equal than 20% and relaxes the social distancing rules when it is below 5% (see Methods for further details). Figure 3 confirms the effectiveness of such a local strategy, where we see that a differentiated strategy among the regions is more effective than a national lockdown in avoiding future waves of the disease ( Figure S3 ) but, most importantly, also in guaranteeing that no region exceeds its own hospitals' capacity. Moreover, intermittent regional measures yield lower economic costs for the country, as regional economies can be restarted and remain open for a much longer time (Table 2 and Table S1 ); an effect that becomes even more apparent when regions concurrently increase their testing capacity as shown in Figure 4 and reported in Table 2 .",

Despite their success, their tolling economic costs have stirred a hot national debate on whether such measures were necessary in the first place and on how to relax them while avoiding future epidemic waves. Several attempts have been made in the literature at addressing this pressing open issues by means of aggregate models (originated from the classical SIR model) to describe the effects of different intervention strategies at the national level 6, 7 . A network model has also been recently proposed to describe the spatial dynamics of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemics among the 107 Italian provinces 14 . Other works in the literature have explored the effects of intermittent measures, either periodic or as a function of some observable quantities, as a viable alternative to long, continuous periods of national lockdown. However, the effects of these strategies have only been investigated on theoretical aggregate models at the national level 7, 22 .",

Our results confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national lockdown measures taken so far. They also convincingly reveal the presence of important regional effects due, for example, to the saturation of regional healthcare systems or to the presence of notable North-South flows in the country that followed the announcement of national measures. Also, contrary to previous work, we explicitly accounted for the strongly nonlinear nature of the model and the uncertainty present in the data by performing a sensitivity analysis on the estimated parameters that further confirmed the robustness of the proposed strategies for a wide range of parameter changes Our study strongly suggests for policy-and decision-makers the potential benefits of differentiated (but coordinated) feedback regional interventions, which can be used independently or in combination with other measures, in order to avoid future epidemic waves or even to contain the outbreak of potential future epidemics. Despite having been focused on Italy, our methodology and modeling approach can be easily extended to other levels of granularity, e.g. countries in a continent or counties in a state, and adapted to any other nation where regional heterogeneity is important and cannot be neglected; notable examples are countries with a federal state organization such as Germany or the United States of America.",

Table S5 [Comparison with the parameters estimated in other papers in the literature for the national aggregate models]. Comparison between the parameter's values we used in our work and those used in other papers proposing national models for the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy that recently appeared in the literature. Notice that, unfortunately, often it is not possible to pin down a specific parameter in a different model that clearly corresponds to one of ours, and vice-versa. This is because of the different meaning that compartments have in the models and the dynamics of people between the compartments which do not always overlap in an unambiguous manner. When we had to use a time constant, say \u03c4, to determine the value of a parameter, say k, that describes the rate of change form compartment A to B, we proceeded as follows. We set k = p / \u03c4, where p \u2208 [0, 1] is the percentage of people that has been estimated to actually move from compartment A to B .   nom  min  max  nom min  max  nom min  max  nom min  max  nom min  max  nom min  max  nom min  max  nom min  max  nom min  max  nom min  max  nom min  max  nom min  max   our model  SIQHRD  variable 0,122 1 -",
