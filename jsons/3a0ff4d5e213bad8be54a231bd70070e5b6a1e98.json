We predict that a large fraction of the state population would be infected without the mitigation efforts, and would certainly overwhelm the capacity of Louisiana health care system.

The exceedingly slow spreading rate in these early months may be partially due to the lack of adequate testing, which remains a major issue at the time of writing.

The number of infections but unidentified, I(t), grows exponentially, as expected from Eq. 6, at the initial stage, and this behavior continues until about day 25, when around 100,000 people are infectious. The exponent of \u223c 0.228 suggests the number of cases double approximately every three days, which seems to be consistent with the data in many areas of the world before the mitigation efforts are kicked in. After day 25, the rate of increase slow down due to the combination of the decrease on the number of susceptible (uninfected) people and the increase on the number of recoveries. The number of infected cases ceases to grow exponentially, but rather becomes a stable but constant increases until peaking at around day 50, corresponding to early May.

Improvement can be achieved by including additional factors, such as correlation with different age groups, correlation with the health condition of the population, the availability of public health care, the effect of higher ambient temperature and humidity, and many others. Some of those factors are likely beyond the SIR model which implicitly assume that the population is homogeneous and well mixed, and that infection occurs without time delay. However, given the rather limited data available today, it is not clear that more sophisticated models may provide much better predictions.",
