The distribution of these viruses among modern primates is consistent with a complex history of cross-species transmissions between different host lineages [2], [3]. Well-documented examples include the emergence of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 in humans in the mid-to-late 20th century, and emergence of pathogenic SIVmac in captive Asian macaques in the 1970s [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The exact time and circumstances under which SIVsm initially jumped from sooty mangabeys into rhesus macaques to give rise to SIVmac are unknown, but it is very likely that transmission may have resulted from experimental interventions involving the transfusion of material from one species into another [9]. Despite the extraordinary attention the primate lentiviruses have since received from the AIDS research community, very little is known about the impact of host genetic variation on the transmission of these viruses between different primate species, or the degree to which successful emergence of lentiviral pathogens requires adaptation to overcome genetic divergence between reservoir species and newly emergent hosts.",

            "text": "Cellular restriction factors are host factors that render the host cell resistant to viral infection (also referred to as intrinsic immunity) [10], [11]. For many restriction factor genes, the rate of fixation of nonsynonymous changes often exceeds that expected by genetic drift alone, consistent with evolution under strong positive selection, and it is generally assumed that viral pathogens are the source of selective pressure driving evolution of such genes [12], [13], [14]. As a consequence of positive selection, even phylogenetically similar species are likely to differ in terms of restriction factor functionality. Thus, interspecies differences in restriction factor loci could serve as genetic barriers to cross-species transmission and emergence of viruses. One way to test this hypothesis is to focus on known transmission events and ask whether specific restrictions played a role. Viruses that successfully overcome species-level barriers imposed by restriction should harbor adaptive changes (relative to viruses in the established host) that confer resistance to restriction in the new host. Thus, identification of changes which correlate with host-switching events, and which demonstrably overcome restriction(s) imposed by the new host, constitute direct evidence that a specific host restriction factor can act as determinant of cross-species transmission and emergence of viral pathogens. For example, we previously reported that the host restriction factor TRIM5 can suppress viral replication in vivo, exerting selective pressure during the initial stages of cross-species transmission [15]. More specifically, we demonstrated that allelic variation in TRIM5 influences the outcome of SIVsm infection in rhesus macaques, and that emergence of SIVsm (as pathogenic SIVmac) required adaptations to overcome the genetic barrier imposed by the most common variant of rhesus macaque TRIM5.",

APOBEC3G (A3G) is one of seven members of the APOBEC3 gene cluster found in primates [19], [20]. A3G is expressed in hematopoietic cell populations, including T cells and myeloid cells, all of which are targets for lentiviral infection [21]. Most lentiviruses counter the antiviral activity of A3G by means of an accessory protein called Vif (viral infectivity factor). Vif functions by bridging A3G proteins with a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, thus marking A3G for proteasomal degradation [22]. Typically, the interaction between A3G homologs and the Vif proteins of different lentiviruses are species-specific, indicative of Vif-specific adaptation to A3G of the native host [23], [24], [25].",

To examine the importance of A3G as a determinant of cross-species transmission and emergence of primate lentiviruses, we asked whether A3G-mediated restriction influenced the successful transmission of SIVsm from its native host, the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys), into colonies of Asian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We found that the A3G coding sequences of sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques have several fixed, nonsynonymous differences. Moreover, we found that rhesus A3G (rhA3G) has an unusual polymorphism in the N-terminal domain, in which a highly conserved tyrosine is replaced by a two-amino acid insertion (either Y59/LR59\u201360 or Y59/LL59\u201360). Structural modeling of the insertion indicates that it is in spatial proximity to residue 128, a previously identified determinant of human and African green monkey A3G sensitivity to the Vif proteins of HIV-1 and SIVagm [24], [28], [29]. The model suggests that these two positions (60 and 128) may define a common Vif-interaction surface on A3G that is exploited by lentiviral Vif proteins.",

In contrast, we found that the Vif proteins of multiple, independent SIVmac isolates induced degradation of all three rhesus alleles (rhA3GLR, rhA3GLL and rhA3GY). Furthermore, we identified a single 17Gly-to-17Glu adaptation common to the Vif proteins of multiple SIVmac isolates that confers the ability to degrade rhA3GLR and rhA3GLL. This same adaptation occurred at least twice, once during emergence of SIVmac, and again during intentional adaptation of SIVsm to rhesus macaques by experimental passage in vivo (SIVsmE543) [30]. Convergent evolution, at a specific Vif residue in at least two independent pathogenic SIVmac viruses, clearly indicates that A3G influenced the emergence of pathogenic SIV and simian AIDS in U.S. macaques. Thus, our results demonstrate that APOBEC3G-mediated restriction initially served as an active barrier to full emergence of SIVsm (as SIVmac) in rhesus macaques, selecting for adaptations rendering the virus insensitive to restriction (and therefore better adapted to the macaque host).",

We identified seven nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in rhesus macaque A3G (rhA3G) and four nsSNPs in sooty mangabey A3G (smA3G) (Figure 1A, see also Figure S1). Changes were only chosen when they were detected in at least three independent clones. With one exception (144D/G), the nsSNPs clustered either in the first active domain or the second pseudoactive domain of A3G. In addition to single amino-acid substitutions (59Y/L, 73Q/H/R, 77E/K, 144D/G, 353C/R and 356 C/R), rhesus macaques also have an insertion at position 60 (L or R). The four substitutions in sooty mangabeys included two in the first active domain (76L/R and 111K/E) and two in the second pseudoactive domain (370D/A and 376R/Q). It is notable that polymorphisms in both species are clustered in the same two regions of the protein, and that almost all substitutions in both regions resulted in a difference in charge (either a charge switch or gain/loss of a charge). It is striking that polymorphism at some of these sites occur in multiple species; for example, one of the polymorphic sites found in rhesus macaque (residue 77) and one found in sooty mangabey (residue 110) are both polymorphic in African green monkeys [31]. Similarly, position 130 is polymorphic in both rhesus macaques (either asparagine or aspartic acid) and African green monkeys (either aspartic acid or histidine) [32]. The clustering of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in the first active domain, including polymorphisms at sites that are polymorphic in more than one species, is consistent with a region undergoing extensive, adaptive evolution in response to positive selection. We sought to determine whether any of these variants had functional consequences with respect to restriction of SIVsm and SIVmac.",

In contrast, the rh6 allele and all six of the sooty mangabey alleles retain a highly conserved Tyr at position 59, and lack any additional insertions. Importantly, the Y/LR and Y/LL substitutions are the only differences that distinguish all of the Vif-SIVsmE041-resistant A3G proteins from all of the sensitive alleles, leading us to hypothesize that these substitution are responsible for the observed differences in sensitivity to degradation by Vif-SIVsmE041. To test this hypothesis, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change one of the resistant alleles (rh1) at position 59/60, either substituting the Arg for an Leu (LR \u2192 LL) or removing the insertion and reverting position 59 to the ancestral/conserved Tyr (LR \u2192 Y).

The allelic frequency of rhA3GLR was an impressive 48.9%, followed by rhA3GY (24.7%) and rhA3GLL (26.5%). Likewise, homozygote genotype frequencies were the lowest for rhA3GY/Y and rhA3GLL/LL (8.7% and 14.6%, respectively) and highest for rhA3GLR/LR (32.9%). Using BLAST and sequence alignments, we identified the presence of the LR insertion in at least one additional species of Asian macaques, Macaca fasicularis (crab-eating macaque) (see also [33]). We confirmed this finding by genotyping genomic DNA from 17 crab-eating macaques, and found that this species also harbors the Y/LR polymorphism at positions 59\u201360 (genotype frequencies in this small sampling were: 23% LR/LR; 42% Y/Y; 35% Y/LR). Thus, the A3GLR allele likely dates back at least as far as the common ancestor of rhesus macaques and crab-eating macaques, giving a minimum age of approximately 1.2\u20132.5 million years ago [34]. So far, all other primate A3G sequences in the public sequence databases have the ancestral Tyr at position 59, except for Colobinae spp. which have a Ser at that position [32].

We therefore substituted the individual residues at positions 17 and 21 in Vif-SIVmac239 with the corresponding residues of Vif-SIVsmE041, thereby changing the negatively-charged glutamic acid to an uncharged glycine (E17G) or the positively-charged arginine to a positively charged lysine (R21K), and asked whether either substitution had an effect on the ability of Vif-SIVmac239 to degrade rhA3GLR. We tested both mutants for the ability to induce degradation of rhA3GLR, rhA3GLL and rhA3GY by co-transfection (Figure 4A). Expression of mutant Vif-SIVmac239(E17G), in which the negatively charged amino acid was changed to an uncharged amino acid, failed to induce degradation of rhA3GLR, but was nonetheless functionally intact, as evidenced by the ability to degrade both the rhA3GLL and rhA3GY proteins.",

Likewise, HIV-2 Vif and Vif-SIVstm (an SIV from stump tailed macaques, or Macaca arctoides), both of which represent independent cross-species transmissions originating from SIVsm, also have a glycine at position 17. Thus, Gly17 is well conserved among SIVsm lineages, whereas Glu17 is very likely to have been evolutionarily derived in conjunction with emergence of SIVmac in rhesus macaques, and independently during experimental adaptation of SIVsmE543 to rhesus macaques. This observation, coupled with our experimental results, strongly suggests that the G17E substitution found in viruses of the SIVmac lineage represents adaptation to overcome the interspecies genetic barrier imposed by rhA3GLR alleles.",

The importance of ecological factors in viral emergence is well documented, whereas the significance of host genetic differences as barriers to emergence is still not clear [47]. In particular, it is believed that cellular antiviral restriction factors can act as blockades to cross-species transmission and viral emergence, yet very few studies have examined this possibility in vivo. The emergence of SIVmac and outbreaks of simian AIDS in outbred colonies of macaques in the 1970s provides an unusual opportunity to examine the impact of specific, host-encoded restriction factors in the context of an emerging pathogen. Focusing on SIVsm and SIVmac has multiple advantages for understanding the genetics of lentiviral emergence: both the natural reservoir host and the emergent new host are known (sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques, respectively); archived samples and cloned, primary viral isolates are readily available; and most importantly, several key host-encoded restriction factors that target primate lentiviruses are known and have been well-characterized at the molecular level [48], [49], [50], [51].",

In particular, we found that A3G is polymorphic in rhesus macaques, and that the most frequent rhesus A3G alleles have complex substitutions in the N-terminal domain (Y59/LR59\u201360 and Y59/LL59\u201360). We found that Vif from SIVsm, a virus that jumped species at least twice (to emerge as SIVmac in macaques and as HIV-2 in humans) does not degrade the most common rhesus allele (rhA3GLR), whereas SIVmac Vif degrades all three classes of rhesus alleles (rhA3GLR, rhA3GLL and rhA3GY).",

At present, there are no structural data for the N-terminal active domain of A3G. To visualize how the rhesus 59Y/59LL60/59LR60 polymorphism might also affect interactions with Vif proteins, we modeled the N-terminal sequence of rhA3G onto the recently published human A3C crystal structure [58], [59] (Figure 6).

The model suggests that Arg60 and Lys128 are probably located on the same face of A3G, within approximately 20 \u00c5 of each other. Because variation at both sites affects Vif-mediated degradation, the simplest explanation is that residues 60 and 128 are part of a single Vif-binding surface on A3G (this does not exclude the possibility that different Vif homologs have evolved to make different contacts with the same surface). Similarly, an insertion at position 64\u201366 in Colobinae A3G (indicated in blue spheres in Figure 6) can also affect degradation by Vif proteins of primate lentiviruses [32]. It would therefore appear that these three documented determinants of species-specific antiviral activity might occur on a single face of the A3G protein. This observation offers indirect but compelling evidence that divergent lentiviral Vif proteins have exploited the same or closely overlapping binding sites on primate A3G.",

Our results establish that interspecies variation in cellular restriction factor A3G can pose a selective barrier to emergence of AIDS-causing viruses, and just as adaptation of Vif contributed to the emergence of pathogenic SIVmac, Vif plasticity could have contributed to the modern distribution of simian immunodeficiency viruses among their respective primate reservoirs.",

Thus, the original transmission event(s) may not recapitulate the kinds of mechanisms that are thought to typically give rise to interhost transmission of primate retroviruses in nature, such as biting, fighting with, or preying on, viremic individuals. Nevertheless, replication of primary isolates of SIVsmm in rhesus macaques is highly variable and typically much lower relative to SIVmac isolates, such that the emergence of SIVmac is very likely to have required adaptations to overcome genetic divergence between the reservoir (sooty mangabey) and spillover (rhesus macaque) hosts [15], [61], [62] Our data indicate that adaptation to overcome restriction by a specific subset of rhesus macaque A3G alleles played a key role in spread of SIVsm in captive colonies of rhesus macaques, ultimately contributing to its emergence as pathogenic SIVmac. At the time of initial cross-species exposure, SIVsm was most likely sensitive to rhA3G alleles with an LR at position 59/60 (and perhaps to a lesser extent, alleles with an LL at position 59/60), but not to alleles with a Y at position 59.",

Because selective breeding programs are used to intentionally maintain diversity in the NPRC colonies, deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium cannot reliably be used to estimate the relative contributions of selection and founder effects. In order to study the possible influence of SIV emergence on host A3G allele frequencies, it may be necessary to recover archived genomic DNA samples from that era, if possible, and to compare historical allele frequencies of captive macaques to allele frequencies of wild macaques in Asia.",

Thus, our data and previously published studies of both A3G and TRIM5 in macaques support the hypothesis that restriction has its greatest biological impact as a modulator of interspecies transmission and emergence of viral pathogens. Evidence of positive selection in primate restriction factor loci may therefore reflect recurrent or continuous lineage-specific exposures to viruses of other species, with repeated transmission events and outbreaks of disease driving fixation of resistance alleles. This could occur in situations where different host populations come into physical contact - for example, as the result of fighting over territory or when one species routinely preys on another. Whether restriction factors continue to play a role after a pathogen becomes established in the new host is not as clear, and will require further study.",

(B) Immunoblot was used to measure packaging of rhA3G into virions using virus preparations also used in the above infectivity experiment. The amount of virus present is measured by detecting the SIV p27 core antigen with an anit-p27 antibody. The relative density of each A3G band (as compared to the corresponding p27 band) is indicated below each lane.",

(A) Position 60 is shown as a red sphere. A previously identified site of positive selection and a determinant of species tropism, K128, is shown as a violet sphere. These two independent determinants of species tropism are predicted to occur on the same face of the A3G N-terminal domain. The site of another previously identified polymorphism of rhesus macaques [32], D/N130, is shown as a light green sphere. Indicated in blue is an insertion found in Colobinae monkeys [32]. Measurements using the predicted C\u03b1 backbone indicate that these residues are within 20 \u00c5 of each other. Additional A3G polymorphisms identified in this study within rhesus macaques (green spheres) or sooty mangabeys (orange spheres) are shown.
