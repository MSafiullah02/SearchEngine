Alongside this, infectious disease remains a serious problem, especially in the less-developed provinces of China, such as Guangxi and Yunnan. Both provinces are located in southern China, have a warm climate, many ethnic minority groups and a lower level of social and economic development. For example, the prevalence rates of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in Yunnan and Guangxi provinces are highest and second highest in China. The incidence rates of some infectious diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis, are much higher than those in more-developed provinces, and pose a serious threat to the health and social stability of these areas. Additionally, both provinces are bordered by other countries of South-east Asia including Vietnam, Laos and Burma. Co-operation with these countries in order to prevent and control new and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as avian flu, H1N1 flu and HIV/AIDS, is an important part of the health strategies of the two provinces.1, 2\n",

The less-developed provinces in China face much greater public health problems than the more-developed provinces, but there are fewer public health professionals available to respond. Demand for services is high and this is likely to increase as increasing health awareness (known in China as the \u2018health-oriented principle\u2019) is being increasingly filtered into the population mindset. This, in turn, will increase demand for public health professionals. It has been recognized that there are insufficient qualified, capable public health workers in the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) and other public health organizations,3 particularly in less-developed provinces. This is partly a result of the gap between education and practice in public health,3, 4 with a need to develop capacity in the public health workforce for disease control and health protection, and also to ensure that health systems deliver effective healthcare.5\n",

Many teachers responsible for teaching infectious disease have little or no direct experience in the taught areas. Few have ever seen a bubonic plague or cholera patient, or participated in dealing with serious public health emergencies such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 influenza or avian flu. Most of the teachers do not understand the latest national health policies, nor know the requirements of potential employers of their students. Many schools place more emphasis on laboratory research than population research, having limited content in the curriculum that can be applied to practical situations, as the former is more likely to produce high-impact publications.",

Alternatively, schools of public health and CDCs can be brought together to work more closely in other creative ways. A promising model has emerged in Yunnan. The Director of Yunnan CDC was concurrently appointed as the Dean of the School of Public Health of Kunming Medical College in 2008. This was the first appointment of its type in China. As a result, good communication, fruitful collaborations and a reduction in the education\u2013practice gap have occurred in the region. For example, senior experienced staff at the provincial CDC have been appointed as adjunct professors to teach at the school, and are able to participate in both teaching and research. Conversely, teachers at the school are also appointed as adjunct staff of the provincial CDC, so that they can participate in and observe the service work on the one hand and help with training programmes for the CDC on the other. Staff of the two organizations are frequently invited to give lectures and seminars at the opposite institution, and they can also attend each others' lectures and seminars of interest. Furthermore, municipal and county CDCs have become members of the teaching base of the school, and 18 municipal and county CDCs have opened their laboratory facilities to the school. These arrangements have extensively widened the opportunities for exposure to real public health work for both teachers and students, and also opened up many new opportunities for collaboration in public health activities across the two sectors.17\n",
