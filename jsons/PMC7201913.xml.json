This pandemic had started in the Wuhan city of China where the first case was reported on 31st December 2019 [1, 2] and on 11th March 2020 the World health organization (WHO) had declared it as a global pandemic and as a public health emergency of international concern [3]. Within a short span of 3 months a significant proportion of different geographic regions of the world are facing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic [4\u20136]. Government of India has imposed a nationwide lockdown from 24th March 2020 to contain the spread of coronavirus infection. The pandemic has caused major disruption of health care services both in high income and low and middle income countries with limited resources. The challenges faced by health care sector include, caring for critical COVID-19 patients in hospitals resulting in massive diversion of critical hospital resources, caring for non COVID-19 patient population with medical and surgical emergencies and last but not the least - protecting health care providers (HCP) and implement new infection control protocols. In most of the hospitals worldwide, surgeons are operating only on patients with life threatening emergencies and postponing majority of elective surgical cases. The challenges surgical community facing include screening for COVID status, protection of HCP, judicious use of limited personal protective equipment (PPE) and other hospital resources.",

These organizations include American college of surgeons (ACS), society of surgical oncology (SSO), European society of surgical oncology (ESSO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), Irish head and neck society, British Association of Surgical Oncology (BASO) and British gynecological cancer society (BGCS) [7\u201312].",

Tele consultations can be offered to these patients.Any treatment planning should be made in the context of current and emerging covid situation, facilitating completion of oncologically appropriate treatment protocols in near future.Operate on patients presenting with onco- surgical emergencies with all precautions as recommended for any surgical emergency during covid pandemic.Decisions regarding elective cancer surgeries should be individualized based on type, stage, biology, availability of non-surgical treatment options and status of resources in the treating center.Whenever feasible offer non-surgical treatment options in consultation with medical and radiation oncology (eg.Tamoxifen for hormone receptor positive breast cancer, pre-operative chemo/radiation for rectal or esophageal cancers) to contain or down stage the disease and subsequently plan elective surgery.Offer surgery to patients, when non-surgical treatment options are not available or if the treating team feels that delay of surgery threatens patient\u2019s survival chances.Postpone elective cancer surgery in patients with less aggressive and slowly growing cancers (differentiated thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, low grade soft tissue tumors, DCIS, basal cell carcinoma etc.).Avoid aerosol generating procedures whenever feasible including endoscopies and laparoscopies.Involve the anesthesia and critical care teams for surgical, critical care and post op recovery planning.\n",
