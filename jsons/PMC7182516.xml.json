The disease may cause the rapid death of those affected, depending on their general health conditions and socio-demographic profile. A relevant question about the spread of 2019-nCoV is whether climatic or demographic characteristics enable a more significant expansion of the virus. Bukhari and Jameel (2020) reported that 2019-nCoV spread rapidly to many countries, and a world pandemic crisis was subsequently declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). The authors observed that a similar variant of 2019-nCoV, the influenza virus, has been affected by climate.",

It has also been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 and other closely related coronaviruses, such as influenza and Ebola, had significant relations to environmental factors (Yip et al., 2007; Thai et al., 2015; Ng and Cowling, 2014; Lowen and Steel, 2014; Bi et al., 2007; Barreca and Shimshack, 2012; Moriyama and Ichinohe, 2019; Casanova et al., 2010). Some studies (Chan et al., 2011; Van Doremalen et al., 2013; Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) have claimed that the survival time of coronaviruses on surfaces depends on temperature increases or decreases; therefore, temperature could affect the virus transmission risk. Thus far, it is reasonable to hypothesize that differences in annual average temperatures could significantly influence the transmission of the virus.",

In the sensitivity analysis, the second test considered the logN of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per habitant for two reasons. First, the test accounted for the proportion of the population in the confirmed cases, and second, because a significantly negative correlation between temperature and population was found. A hypothesis, therefore, arises whether the significantly negative correlation between the COVID-19 confirmed cases and temperature is due to the greater size of the population in the cities with low temperatures.",

In this study, for the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperature ranges from 16.8 \u00b0C to 27.4 \u00b0C. Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases. The curve became flat with a threshold of 25.8 \u00b0C. There is no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8 \u00b0C. The authors believe that by using this model, it is possible to test new factors and reveal new determinants capable of fitting the trend regression to a maximum of R-squared.
