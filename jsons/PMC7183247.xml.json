We develop short, small-file health videos that are shareable via smartphones using minimal data. Two principles guide our content development: 1) the use of narratives to engage viewers and minimize reactance/counter-arguing to the health messages [1,6] and 2) the value of entertainment-education for providing a framework that supports longer term message retention and behavior change [4]. In terms of video development, we use a human-centered design approach, keeping the needs and desires of our target audiences at the forefront, while employing a process of rapid iteration and feedback during the development process [7].",

The first half of the video uses tense music that emphasized the urgency of the situation; the second half uses uplifting music that is meant to inspire hope and feelings of self-efficacy. Sound effects were strategically used to enhance engagement in the story. We made a concerted decision to keep the video short (less than 2.5 minutes) to sustain attention and facilitate video sharing.",

Non-academics felt the tension-building helped to sustain engagement and drove home the message that viewers needed to take public health recommendations seriously. We ultimately decided to strike a balance. We retained the storyline but slowed and softened the fast-paced, dramatic music. We ultimately felt that a degree of tension-building was necessary to maintain engagement, especially among those who were defying public health recommendations. Building tension towards a central climax also aligned with best practices for using dramatic storytelling to alter audience behavior [3].",

They therefore expedited the review and approvals process, posting the video on Stanford Medicine\u2019s YouTube channel on 22 March 2020. This was followed by postings on Stanford University\u2019s Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts. The video began going viral within 24 hours. Within ten days, it had reached 332K views (YouTube), 220K views (Instagram), 294K views (Facebook) and 402K views (Twitter). Ten days after its release, across only the Stanford social media platforms, the video had reached more than 1.2 million views. (Figure 1) Additionally, the lead author, whose contact appears at the end of the video, received email requests to repost the video on external social media channels from 23 private and public sector health agencies, consulates, military organizations and major media outlets, in six regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, North America, South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia).

By leaning on best-practices from entertainment-education, communication theory and the animation industry, evidence-based public health messages can be presented in broadly compelling ways, meeting the health communication needs of our diverse global community.",
