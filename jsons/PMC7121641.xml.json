            "text": "Many cellular signaling pathways are precisely localized and rapidly induced in response to environmental stimulation. Elucidation of the nature and functions of complex signaling networks requires development of cellular probes that operate in the same time scale as the signaling events themselves, act in well-defined cellular domains, and can be activated at defined time points [1]. A major strategy employed for this purpose involves a chemically induced heterodimerization to trigger rapid-onset and specific perturbations of various signaling molecules in living cells [2\u20138]. Since most signaling events compose networks operating at multiple intracellular locations [9], it is important to specifically induce signaling in distinct cellular organelles, such as plasma membrane, the Golgi complex, mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or lysosomes.",

Specifically, we designed an anchoring unit that is attached to the cytoplasmic face of a specific organelle and an effector unit that is present in the cytosol and induces a signaling event upon translocation to the target membrane. Such translocation occurs via dimerization of the effector with the anchor, and it can induce site-specific signaling events on the organelle targeted by the anchoring unit (see Fig. 1, left). Furthermore, this technique can be used to dimerize two anchoring units (targeted to different organelles) in order to induce tethering of these organelles (see Fig. 1, right).\n\n",

            "text": "The dimerization system is composed of an anchoring unit and an effector unit. The anchoring unit is designed to localize on the cytosolic face of a specific organelle, and the effector unit is designed to induce specific signaling events on the surface of the organelle targeted by the anchor. Plasmids for the anchoring and the effector units should be prepared by using standard subcloning protocols.\nConstruct design for the anchoring unit:The design of the anchoring unit is based on proteins that are known to specifically localize in the target organelle. This unit also includes a fluorescent protein and one of the two dimerizing domains that are targeted to the cytosolic face of the organelle. The already designed organelle-targeting constructs are summarized in Fig. 3 [1]; however, it may be important to design novel organelle anchors. Here, we describe how to develop such a novel unit using the Golgi anchoring motif as an example.\n\nSince it is impossible to predict the cellular localization of a particular protein based on its structural features, new anchors should be developed using a trial-and-error approach involving structural analysis of known organelle-resident proteins. To obtain motifs that specifically target the Golgi complex, we tried four different Golgi proteins and found that constructs derived from giantin work the best (Fig. 4). Giantin is a Golgi-specific structural protein [14] that is known to interact with multiple proteins to maintain the Golgi structure [15]. Since we intended to eliminate unwanted interactions between the anchoring unit and other proteins, we focused on the giantin sequence around its transmembrane domain (TMD). We found that a minimum sequence around the TMD is successfully targeted to the Golgi without disrupting morphology of this organelle. Therefore, this sequence was selected as the Golgi anchoring unit.\n\nNext, we selected the dimerization domain and optimized the order of the dimerization domain and the fluorescent protein in the designed construct. These two parameters are known to affect the expression level of the anchor, the heterodimerization rate, and the structural features of the targeted organelle (see\nNote\n14). Specifically, we swapped FKBP with FRB and placed FKBP or FRB at the N-terminal or the C-terminal ends of either the fluorescent protein or the anchoring motif. A construct with the following order, FKBP\u2013(fluorescent protein)\u2013(giantin TMD), appears to be the most suitable for our purposes.Construct design for the effector unit:The effector unit can be designed to perturb cellular signaling mediated by small GTPases [1, 2, 16, 17] or phosphoinositides [3, 16, 18]. Here we describe the design of the effector construct aimed to perturb GTPase signaling. GTPases are known to cycle between an active, GTP-bound and inactive, GDP-bound forms. The activation step is controlled by guanine nucleotide-exchanging factors (GEF), whereas the inactivation step is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) (Fig. 5). Based on this activation\u2013inactivation cycle two different strategies for modulating GTPase signaling have been designed. One strategy is to create a constitutively active GTPase that is not regulated by GEF and GAP, and the other strategy is to use a specific GEF for the targeted GTPase. The first approach was used to recruit constitutively active forms of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA to the cellular membranes [2]. The second, more natural approach to activate endogenous GTPases was used to target Rac1 [2, 17], Ras [1], and Arf6 [16]. The design of the effector unit involves removing domains that determine effector compartmentalization to ensure its localization in the cytosol prior to dimerization. Afterwards, dimerization domains and fluorescent proteins are attached in various orders and pairings, and the activity of the constructs is tested.\n\nPlasmid preparation:Prepare the plasmids according to standard subcloning protocols using the design strategy described above.

To study the morphology and functions of the targeted organelle, prepare required protein biosensors (see\nNote\n15), antibodies for immunolabeling (see\nNote\n16), and small molecular fluorescent probes, such as calcium sensors and fluorescent lipids (see\nNote\n17).Pre-warm culture media, DMEM with FBS and without antibiotics, trypsin, and DMEM without FBS at 37 \u00b0C.Prepare the transfection mixture in a 1.5 mL sterile microcentrifuge tube. Its composition depends on the transfection reagents used. For Lipofectamine 2000 transfection, dilute up to 2 \u03bcg (normally 0.3\u20131.2 \u03bcg) of plasmid DNA and 4.5 \u03bcL Lipofectamine in 100 \u03bcL DMEM without FBS. If multiple constructs are transfected, their ratio should be optimized by testing expression of each construct.Incubate the transfection mixture for 20 min at room temperature.In the meantime, prepare glass cover slips coated with poly-d-lysine.Trypsinize cells, transfer them into 15 mL tube using 10 mL of the culture medium, and spin them down (1,000 \u00d7 g for 3 min).Resuspend the cells into 1 mL culture media for transfection (per condition).Add 1 mL of resuspended cells to 100 \u03bcL of the transfection mixture, and mix them well by gentle pipetting.Add 50 \u03bcL of the cell suspension onto each cover slip.Leave the cover slips in the incubator for 1 h (see\nNote\n18).Aspirate the media, and add 1 mL of fresh culture media for transfection.Acquire images 24 or 48 h post-transfection.\n",

The medium should not contain chemical dimerizer that should be added only during the fluorescence imaging.Use confocal microscopy for image acquisition. Usually a single Z-point (preferably around the center of the cells), where the translocation and following signaling events can be clearly visualized, is selected for the imaging. For short imaging times (<30 min), neither incubation at 37 \u00b0C nor CO2 are necessary, but these conditions are desirable for longer imaging in order to preserve cell viability.Under the microscope, select the cell(s) for monitoring in the live imaging mode. These cells should contain all the constructs required for the perturbation and monitoring, which should be confirmed by checking appropriate fluorescence signals. Cells that are unusually dim or bright, or that show aberrant localization of the construct, should not be selected (see\nNote\n19).Start the image acquisition in a time-lapse mode. The time frame should be determined depending on the event to be monitored. Usually, translocation is completed within 10 s after addition of chemical dimerizer, so images are generally acquired every 10 or 15 s.After time-lapse imaging has been started, add the chemical dimerizer. It is important to minimize the focus drift during addition of chemical dimerizer. We achieve this by removing half of the medium (500 \u03bcL in the case of imaging in 1 mL volume) from the dish by mechanical pipette, mixing it with the chemical dimerizer, and then gently returning it back into the dish (see\nNote\n20). Then, the dimerizer rapidly reaches cells by diffusion, so the translocation should begin immediately. The microscope operating software should be used to monitor the timing of stimuli for subsequent data analysis.Acquire images until the event of interest is completed.\n",

The latter approach is useful to examine protein translocation to irregular compartments or small or thin organelles, where quantification may be difficult due to cellular movement. For example, translocation of Ras-binding protein to the Golgi complex can be examined by monitoring the increase in fluorescence intensity of the Golgi. On the other hand, translocation to the plasma membrane is better analyzed by monitoring the decrease in the cytosolic fluorescence, because the plasma membrane is thin, and its fluorescence measurements suffer from high noise level due to ROI drift.\n",

            "text": "\nDimerization systems that are orthogonal to the rapamycin-based system have been reported, such as gibberellin-based heterodimerization. When using the rapamycin-induced system, one should be aware that rapamycin can inhibit mTOR activity, thereby perturbing downstream signaling events [21]. However, these downstream effects of mTOR activation require hours to develop; therefore, they will unlikely interfere with cellular events that occur on a time scale of seconds to minutes. There are alternative chemical dimerizers, such as iRap, which does not affect the mTOR signaling [4].In order to visually confirm the transfection and quantify the translocation, each construct should contain a fluorescent protein, such as CFP, YFP, or mCherry, in addition to the dimerization domain. Since both the anchoring and the effector units are required for perturbation, cells are transfected with a mixture of two constructs that contain the respective dimerization domains and differently colored fluorescent proteins. If the signaling events need to be monitored with fluorescent protein-based biosensors, these sensors are also expressed in the cells. In this case, the anchoring unit is designed without a fluorescent protein to allow tagging this fluorescence protein with the biosensor.The system can be applied to any cultured cells as long as the constructs can be expressed. For example, the tethering systems appeared to be useful in model neutrophils to study the role of phosphoinositide signaling in chemotaxis [15]. In this chapter, we focus on commonly used mammalian cell lines, such as HeLa, NIH3T3, HEK 293, and COS7 cells, for all of which the system has been successfully used.The use of the lipofection reagents with antibiotics can cause cytotoxicity due to the internalization of antibiotics. Therefore, transfection should be performed in the antibiotic-free medium.The optimal concentration of trypsin is determined by the tightness of cellular adhesion. Most cell types can be detached with 0.05 % trypsin, but highly adherent cells such as MDCK require 0.25 % trypsin.Alternatively, commercially available glass-bottomed dishes or chambered cover slips pre-coated with poly-d-lysine can be used.The final concentration of DMSO in the cell culture medium will be 0.1 %. This level of DMSO is well tolerated by the majority of cell lines. For the DMSO-sensitive cell lines (such as neural cells) the final vehicle concentration can be reduced. Adding the same concentration of DMSO to all appropriate controls is essential.The stock solutions should be divided into single-use aliquots that are stored at \u221220 \u00b0C to avoid repeated freeze-and-thaw cycles. During the experiment, the aliquots should be kept on ice before use.Since membrane targeting experiments are usually performed to better understand different steps of the signaling pathways induced by external stimuli, such as growth factors, it is desirable to compare the effects of chemical dimerizers with the effects of physiological stimuli. Such stimuli may also be used as a positive control for cellular responses and biosensors.Many lipophilic sensors are difficult to solubilize and being introduced into the cell. To prepare stock solutions of such sensors, the manufacturer\u2019s instructions should be strictly followed. In general, lipid solutions in organic solvents are dried and then reconstituted in buffers containing defatted BSA with rigorous vortexing, and the resulting BSA\u2013lipid complexes are diluted to the appropriate concentration before adding to the cells.Since growth factors and nutrients in FBS can cause nonspecific signaling in the transfected cells, the imaging experiments should be performed in the FBS-free medium.A confocal microscope is more suitable than an epifluorescence microscope to monitor and quantify protein translocation. Any confocal microscope can be used as long as it can detect differently colored fluorescent proteins independently, and the image acquisition speed is fast enough relatively to the targeted cellular response.A multi-positioning scanner on the microscope makes it possible to monitor signaling events in multiple cells on the dish simultaneously. Monitoring a larger number of cells is desirable in order to increase the reliability of results and identify both false-positive and false-negative events.These effects can be evaluated by measuring fluorescence intensities of the constructs, the responses to chemical dimerizers, the fluorescence images of co-expressed organelle markers, and viability of the transfected cells. Different responses may be due to differences in protein stability and/or the steric environment of the FKBP\u2013FRB interaction.Fluorescent biosensors can be used to visualize signaling events induced by the organelle-specific manipulations described above. Several biosensors are available to monitor live cell activity of small GTPases. For example, Ras activation can be examined by a fluorescent protein attached to the Ras-binding domain (RBD) that specifically interacts with active Ras [22]. Additionally, several FRET-based biosensors for small GTPases have been developed [23].If the appropriate biosensor is not available, the downstream signaling events can be studied by immunofluorescence labeling with phospho-specific antibodies. Since transfection efficiency can vary from cell to cell, and some cells might show either high or low level of construct expression, the signaling events should be analyzed in the cells with moderate level of expressed reporters.A key question in studying organelle-to-organelle communications is how the interaction causes redistribution of the molecules of interest. Phospholipids are important messengers, and their translocation during organelle\u2013organelle interactions can be studied by using the membrane-tethering system and commercially available fluorescently conjugated lipids [20]. For example, we used fatty acid-labeled phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., AL, USA) to monitor phospholipid translocation at junctional sites of ER and mitochondria upon organelle tethering.The incubation time should be exactly 1 h.During the search for cells to image, care should be taken to limit light exposure, and avoid photobleaching of the constructs or photodamages of the cells.This also helps to preserve the temperature before and after addition of the chemical dimerizers to avoid the focus drift arising from temperature changes.\n",
