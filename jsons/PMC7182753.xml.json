By January 7, 2020, a novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified, while the disease has been named COVID-19. COVID-19 has now been declared a pandemic, affected nearly every country, with over 2.3 million confirmed cases and >160,000 deaths. The initial clinical case series from China largely comprised of hospitalised patients with severe pneumonia. Further data suggested that approximately 80% patients have mild disease, 20% require hospital admission, and approximately 5% require intensive care admission [1]. Mortality rates are higher among people over 60 years and with coexisting conditions; hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease being the most common. Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments about virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature.",

There is also substantial antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [3, 5]. A recent study confirmed that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed in the human respiratory tract epithelium, is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV and has been shown to cause pneumonia in lab mice only expressing human ACE2 [6, 7]. This is likely mediated by the RBD of the S glycoprotein [8]. Although there is obvious homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and cross neutralization has been observed [9], significant biological differences, specifically in the S glycoprotein have been noted [5, 10, 11].",

In a study that compared three well-conducted Chinese case series to a reference group of patients with influenza-associated pneumonia from 73 German sentinel hospitals, the severity of pneumonia even in adults aged <60 years without chronic preconditions was significantly greater in COVID-19. For instance, 28% of COVID-19 patients treated on the ICU had no reported comorbidity. The rate of ARDS and mechanical ventilation was markedly higher among COVID-19 patients. The median duration of ventilation was 9 days for non-invasive, and 17 days for invasive ventilation [12].",

Furthermore, up to 10% patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms without respiratory symptoms or fever [17]. COVID-19 has been associated with a hypercoagulable state with increased risk of venous thromboembolism[18]. Neurological manifestations, including headache, dizziness, altered consciousness, ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes, as well as muscle injury, have also been reported [19]. A third of patients reported taste or olfactory disorders in a small Italian cohort, including anosmia [20]. Other extrapulmonary manifestations include skin and ocular manifestations. An Italian study reported cutaneous manifestations in 20% patients [21]. Lastly, ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis was reported in 32% COVID patients in a Chinese case series [22].",

Patients may initially appear relatively stable, but they often rapidly deteriorate with severe hypoxia [13, 17]. The key feature seen in these cases is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [13, 17]. The interval from symptom onset to the development of ARDS is approximately 8-12 days [13].

Factors most associated with critical illness were admission oxygen saturation <88%, first d-dimer>2500, first ferritin >2500, and first CRP >200 [24].

In addition, several tests at different points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment.[32]. Therefore, a single positive test should be confirmed by a second qRT-PCR assay targeting a different SARS-CoV-2 gene. Although, similar studies in Taiwan and Hong Kong reported less false-negatives[33]. Secondly, a single negative SARS-CoV-2 test (especially if from upper respiratory tract specimen) or a positive test result for another respiratory pathogen result should not be used to exclude COVID-19 infection. These findings indicate that qRT-PCR has low probability of ruling out an infection and in clinically high suspicious cases repeat sampling and also CT images may need to be used to guide the diagnosis.",

The commercial S1 IgG and IgA assays have lower specificity but IgA showing higher sensitivity [36]. Recently, an ELISA assay based on detection of recombinant S protein by serum antibodies demonstrated robust and scalable determination of seroconversion that will facilitate screening of potential exposed individuals for evidence of past infection [38].

However, approximately 30% failed to develop good level of NAb titres (ID50: < 500)[39]. In addition, patients who did not generate NAbs at the time of discharge did not develop NAbs thereafter. These results highlight that some patients with SARS-CoV-2 would recover without developing high titers of virus-specific NAbs. These findings have some implications for vaccine development and also for convalescent plasma treatment as the donor plasma should be titrated before use in passive therapy.

SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in whole blood [41], saliva [42], faeces [43], and urine [44] by qRT-PCR (Table 1\n). In several case series with serial sampling, viral loads were highest soon after symptom onset [35, 45]. Patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher viral load and longer period of viral shedding than mild cases [46]. Prolonged viral RNA shedding has been reported from throat swabs up to 37 days among adult patients [13], and in faeces, for over one month after illness onset in children[40, 47]. However, detection of viral RNA by qRT-PCR does not necessarily equate with infectious virus. No live virus was cultured from 9 mild COVID-19 cases beyond day 8 after symptom onset in throat swabs or sputum despite ongoing high viral load [35]. Persistently high levels of RNA were also identified in the stool of the mild cases, but no live virus was cultured [35]. These findings suggest that patients may continue to shed RNA in various samples for a long period, but this does not equate to infectiousness potential (Table 1). This supports the current guidance of 7-14 days self-isolation from symptom onset. Certain hospitals following a protocol to confirm viral clearance prior to transfer out of dedicated COVID-19 wards, however, this may not be required given the prolonged RNA shedding without the evidence of viable virus. However, whether faecal-oral or faecal-respiratory transmission occurs, and the role of shedding in severe cases in transmission requires further exploration.",

There have been several reports of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic or presymptomatic persons [55, 56], which poses significant challenges to contact tracing. Nevertheless, the relative contribution of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission on the overall transmission dynamics of the pandemic remains uncertain. Thus, household studies to study secondary human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and serosurveys to determine the incidence of asymptomatic and subclinical infections are needed.",

Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), a protease inhibitor used as an antiretroviral, showed inconclusive findings for the treatment of SARS, but demonstrated strong in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against MERS-CoV when combined with interferon-beta (IFNb) [59]. The first of a number of clinical trials involving LPV/r was recently published [60]. Among 199 seriously ill laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, no significant difference in clinical improvement, mortality or viral clearance was observed between LPV/r (n=99) and standard care (n=100) arms. However, treatment was instituted late in infection; median time from symptom onset to treatment was 13 days, and >40% of patients had undetectable viral load before or during treatment. The results were complicated by the variable use of other treatments, including interferon, glucocorticoids and antibiotics. Of note, day 28 mortality was lower (not significantly) in those with early treatment (19% vs. 27%) and those who received LPV/r also had lower vasopressor and non-invasive ventilation use.",

Nevertheless, key questions remain regarding understanding the population at risk and age groups, proportion of individuals that have had asymptomatic infections and their transmission potential, endemicity and seasonality of COVID-19, and whether stringent physical distancing measures will be effective in countries outside China. The main challenge in managing COVID19 remains the patient density, however, accurate diagnoses as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases remains a daily battle for many clinicians. For improved management of cases, there is a need to understand test probability of serology, qRT-PCR and radiological testing, and the efficacy of available treatment options that could be used in severe cases with high risk of mortality.",
