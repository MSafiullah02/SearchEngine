            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) severely affects pigs reared in commercial farms worldwide, causing serious economic losses (Sasaki et al., 2016). Like in many other Asian countries, farms in Japan have experienced PED epidemics, including one that caused more than 1,000 outbreaks in the period 2013\u20132014 (Sasaki, Toyomaki, et al., 2017; Suzuki et al., 2015). PED infection can occur not only in farms with unvaccinated animals, but also in those where they have been vaccinated, the former being at a higher risk of causing epidemics. In the case of PED infection in Japan, the reason it spread so rapidly may be due to the fact (Toyomaki, Sekiguchi, Sasaki, Sueyoshi, & Makita, 2018) that suppliers did not distribute the vaccine quickly enough.",

Typical PED clinical signs in pigs include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and consequently, loss of bodily fluids, appetite and weight. Reproductive performance of sows is also seriously reduced by PED infection (Sasaki, Kawabata, & Noguchi, 2017). For example, sows in their first month of pregnancy deliver fewer piglets and have higher abortion rates (Olanratmanee, Kunavongkrit, & Tummaruk, 2010). Similarly, the number of stillbirth piglets is high in litters of PED\u2010infected sows going into their third or fourth month of pregnancy (Olanratmanee et al., 2010). Indeed, mortality can be very high among young pigs, as it can reach nearly 100% in newborns (Jung & Saif, 2015; Sueyoshi et al., 1995) and as much as 80% in suckling pigs (Shibata et al., 2000). Although piglets can survive a PED infection, they experience abnormality and malfunction of the small intestine (Curry, Gibson, et al., 2017), and reduction of fat, lean, protein, and bone mineral gains (Curry, Schwartz, Yoon, Gabler, & Burrough, 2017); hence, subsequent growth performance is greatly affected. In addition, reduced milk production was previously found in PED\u2010infected sows (Sueyoshi et al., 1995), but it remains unclear to what extent the nutritional level of sow milk is affected by PED infection (Huang et al., 2018).",

            "text": "In recent years, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) supplementation has been used to treat certain viral infections. For example, Zhang, Azevedo, Gonzalez, et al. (2008) demonstrated that lactobacilli induced immune responses in the intestine of neonatal gnotobiotic pigs, which conferred protection against human rotavirus (HRV). Likewise, after Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and Bifidobacterium animalis lactis Bb12 supplementation, Kandasamy, Chattha, Vlasova, Rajashekara, and Saif (2014) found that neonatal gnotobiotic pigs had lower fecal scores and shedding concentrations of HRV, and higher intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody\u2010releasing cell numbers and IgA antibody concentration against the virus. Based on this, giving weaning piglets a cell preparation of Enterococcus faecalis, a LAB species, protected them from rotavirus infection (Tsukahara, Nakanishi, Matsubara, Itoh, & Ushida, 2006). Clearly, LAB supplementation seems to enhance the lactogenic immunity and the efficacy of vaccines administered to pigs. Previously, we reported that a probiotic compound with peptide\u2010zinc complexes named BIO\u2010THREE PZ, containing live bacteria Bacillus mesentericus, Clostridium butyricum and Enterococcus faecalis, improved the reproductive performance of sows and prevented post\u2010weaning diarrhea in piglets (Hayakawa, Masuda, Kurosawa, & Tsukahara, 2016). More recently, we also showed that the above probiotic compound improved the reproductive performance of sows vaccinated against PED and reduced mortality in suckling piglets (Inatomi, Amatatsu, Romero\u2010P\u00e9rez, Inoue, & Tsukahara, 2017).",

            "text": "Previously, a probiotic compound containing B. licheniformis and B. subtilis spores was supplemented to sows for two reproductive cycles (Kritas et al., 2015). Kritas et al. observed several benefits conferred by probiotic supplementation, including increased feed consumption and reduced weight loss during lactation in sows. Due to our previous study also partly proving that supplementation with the probiotic (BIO\u2010THREE) improved the feed intake of sows during lactation (Hayakawa et al., 2016), we believe that similar benefits were conferred to sows in the present study. Although no phylogenetic screening of gut microbes was performed in the present work, we can cautiously but positively speculate that probiotics likely competed with pathogens in the gut and stimulated the immune system of sows, which equipped the animals with more resistance to infections (Kritas & Morrison, 2005). Our previous study also suggested that probiotics supplementation modified the gut microbiota by inducing an increase in lactobacilli and a decrease in E. coli (Hayakawa et al., 2016). Peptide\u2010zinc complexes in the probiotic compound used in this study also likely contributed to enhance the immune system of sows, as addition of zinc\u2010oxide to feed was previously shown to help reduce diarrhea incidence and assist in weight gain in pigs (Chai et al., 2014). Thus, a supply of beneficial bacterial strains and zinc to PED\u2010infected sows likely enhanced their overall health, which permitted them to eat more, better utilizing nutrients from feed, and gaining more weight. Consequently, healthier sows produced more milk (Figure 3) and had higher protein concentrations in milk that improved its quality (Figure 4). Therefore, it can be considered that a greater weight gain and a higher milk production were indirect benefits of probiotic compound supplementation (B\u00f6hmer, Kramer, & Roth\u2010Maier, 2006).",

In an elegant review, Song and Park (2012) described lactogenic immunity as protection against infection given by vaccinated sows to suckling piglets via colostrum and milk. Unexpectedly, in the present study probiotic supplementation to sows significantly increased the concentration of IgA and IgG in milk despite the fact that they were unvaccinated. Nonetheless, it has been previously reported that probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus given to pigs acted as adjuvant to vaccination which resulted in enhanced immune cells producing antibodies such as IgA, IgG and IgM (Zhang, Azevedo, Wen, et al., 2008). Thus, a possible scenario in the present study can be described as follows: probiotic bacteria used re\u2010colonized the gut of sows, which likely stimulated early maturation of gut immunity and fended off infection (Chattha, Roth, & Saif, 2015), resulting in an increase in the concentration of PED\u2010specific antibodies in whey. This plausible scenario is strongly supported by our results (Figure 5c,d).",

            "text": "PED infection causes impaired reproductive performance in sows which results in negative productive performance (e.g., mortality) during the development of suckling piglets. It is believed that the lower body weight of sows caused by a decrease in appetite and a lower efficiency of nutrient utilization during the course of a viral infection prevents sows from returning to estrus in a timely manner (Tantasuparuk, Dalin, Lundeheim, Kunavongkrit, & Einarsson, 2001). However, Kritas et al. (2015) showed that giving B. subtilis C\u20103102 to sows helped them return to estrus more rapidly. In the present study, probiotic supplementation to PED\u2010infected sows significantly reduced the number of days to recurrence of estrus (Figure 6). As discussed above, when compared to control sows, better nutrition in probiotic\u2010supplemented sows was likely the cause for a shorter period between weaning and estrus (Tantasuparuk et al., 2001). In contrast, decreased appetite likely caused reduction of milk production. Indeed, while producing milk for eight piglets, suckling healthy sows produced more than 6.6 kg milk/day for 4\u20137 days post\u2010parturition (Toner, King, Dunshea, Dove, & Atwood, 1996); milk supply to neonates of suckling PED\u2010infected sows was no more than 4.0 kg/day 7 days post\u2010parturition in same conditions (Figure 3). This result is in agreement with a previous report (Sueyoshi et al., 1995).",

Moreover, Kritas et al.

In contrast, in the present study piglets farrowed by probiotic\u2010supplemented sows had a significantly lower mortality percentage and tended to have a greater weight at birth than did those farrowed by control sows (Figure 7). A plausible explanation for this data discrepancy may be that the probiotic compound used in the present study was not a single stain probiotic compound but rather a combination of B. mesentericus, C. butyricum and E. faecalis. Indeed, multi\u2010strain probiotic compounds have been found to be more effective at fending off pathogens (Chapman, Gibson, & Rowland, 2011, 2012) than single stain probiotics such as the one used by Kritas et al.
