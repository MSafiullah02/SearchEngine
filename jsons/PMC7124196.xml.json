The term \u201cflatted factories\u201d is after the British expression for apartment. Mainly in response to land scarcity, flatted factories were originated in Hong Kong in the 1960s and some other districts also adopted this special arrangement such as Singapore (Lim, 2011). Dim Sum, a Hong Kong local meal in which items are served separately from steam baskets stacked in tower formations as a kind of vertical culinary zoning, is a vivid analogy in describing Hong Kong's flatted factories as vertical and volumetric configuration (Shelton et al., 2011).",

Economic restructuring decades on has rendered most of these industrial buildings no longer for the intended uses and therefore transformations are needed. There are many concepts related to this process: urban re-development, regeneration, renewal, revitalisation, reconstruction, rehabilitation and so on (Kamo, 2000). These terms, similar in nature though, have subtleties in academia (Lees, 2003). While the public-sector-initiated urban renewal in the 1960s was primarily concerned with the large-scale redevelopment of overcrowded inner city slum area, urban regeneration in the 1980s encouraged the involvement of private sector so as to spur more economic growth (Parvin & Mostafa, 2010).",

From a modest beginning in the 1950s, the manufacturing sector grew rapidly in Hong Kong and it was the golden age of Hong Kong's industries. Such prosperity continued during the 1960s, mainly owing to the incorporation of Hong Kong into the global manufacturing and market networks under the backdrop that spatial relocation of manufacturing production in the world economy took place and international subcontracting networks emerged (Chiu & Liu, 2009: 26\u201329). Increasing space requirement for manufacturing activities had led to prosperous construction of multi-storey industrial buildings. In the market, most of such industrial space was provided by the private sector (Tang & Tang, 1999). In the 1970s, the tertiary sector replaced the manufacturing industry, becoming the leading economic sector in Hong Kong. Labour-intensive manufacturing industries in Hong Kong began to lose competitive advantage because of the rising production costs, particularly the rising labour costs and land rent.",

            "text": "After Hong Kong's returning to China in 1997, the changing institutional configuration brought Hong Kong both opportunities and challenges. In the decade of 2000s, cross-border development and regional integration of Hong Kong and the PRD region experienced ups and downs. Hong Kong underwent economic recession and outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the year of 2003 and in the same year China entered WTO. The PRD region was provided with expanding domestic and global market. The PRD region was no longer relied so heavily on Hong Kong and was on her way towards more self-contained development (R.C.K. Chan, 2011). In addition, the institutional environment in the PRD began to change with Guangdong provincial government and the Central Government emphasising more on environmental concern and labour right protection (Liao & Chan, 2011). With the loss of competitive advantage in terms of costs of production, there was a new wave of industrial upgrade in the PRD region. The traditional \u201cstore in front, factory behind\u201d model began to change with more and more \u201cstores in front\u201d relocated from Hong Kong to the PRD region and \u201cfactory behind\u201d relocated from the PRD region to inland and other areas of lower cost of production (Liao and Chan, 2011, Yeh, 2006). During the same period, Hong Kong's technology-based urban competitiveness building slowed down, and business-service competitiveness building approach began to take a leading role (Martinelli, Moulaert, & Novy, 2013). With CEPA and the imaginaries of \u201cPan-PRD\u201d released in 2004, the cross-boundary development and regional integration was promoted significantly. Service sectors of Hong Kong were provided with expanding and easier-access domestic market in the Mainland (Chiu, 2006, Yeh and Xu, 2008). Later, the \u201cOutline of the Plan for Reform and Development of the PRD Region (2008\u20132020)\u201d was released in 2009 by the State Council to further promote cross-boundary cooperation by policies. However, industries in Hong Kong have been facing severer competition from her rivals including the old partner\u2014the PRD region. The concern of \u201cmarginalization of Hong Kong\u201d was raised not until the \u201cPan-PRD\u201d imaginaries but since when Hong Kong has been losing her competitive advantage with the economic miracles happened cross the border (Martinelli et al., 2013). Hong Kong is no longer of costs-based competitive advantage. Targeting mainly at international financial services, trading and logistics, tourism, and professional and producer services, Hong Kong repositioned itself to become Asia's world city (Kong, 2007).",

In multi-storey industrial buildings, limited access, complexities in fire safety, problems with natural lighting and ventilation lead to high technical requirements in revitalisation, particularly in wholesale conversion to meet Hong Kong's design and planning requirements for more flexible uses. In 2013, there used to be a proposal to convert industrial buildings into transitional, but was voted down later by the Government by concluding it is not practicable. It is stated by the Government that even if it is technically feasible, the considerable costs required in conversion would undermine its viability (Development Bureau HKSAR, 2011). Currently, residential uses are still illegal in industrial buildings in Hong Kong (Fig. 3\n), and thus the lofts with work-living mix-use those are very popular in Europe and in North America are not allowable in Hong Kong. Undeniable, fragmented ownership and technical difficulties related to Hong Kong's high-density development contribute to a high threshold of capital in revitalisation of flatted industrial buildings.",

According to the most recent survey conducted in 2009 by Planning Department (Planning Department HKSAR, 2010), industrial premises still engaged in industrial and related uses was not high\u2014only about 39% in [OU(B)] zone and about 65% in \u201cI\u201d zone. Are the rest left vacant? Actually, the rest of the floor area is either occupied by none industrial uses or left vacant. Vacancy rates for various categories of industrial premises were maintained at relatively low levels at or below 10.0% in 2009, and the number is descending year by year with a number ranging from 4.5% to 6.7% in 2012 (Table 3\n). The 2009 survey (Planning Department HKSAR, 2010: 19) suggests that industrial buildings in some areas such as Wong Chuk Hang and Kwun Tong is with a higher vacancy rates because some of them are in the vacating process to make way for redevelopment. This means private flatted industrial buildings without revitalisation plan should have lower vacancy rates than the average figure. On the other hand, change in uses of private industrial buildings needs to be reported to the Government to apply for temporary waivers. Yet, there are only 441 temporary waivers granted by Lands Department for change in use of industrial buildings as at March 2009, coving only more than 1% of the existing stock of industrial premises. The gap behind these numbers reveals non-compliant uses are widespread. Therefore, there is big \u201cbrownfields\u201d in Hong Kong's revitalisation of industrial buildings. The term \u201cbrownfields\u201d at first only refers to land previously occupied for industrial uses or some commercial uses that may be contaminated and has the potential to be reused again (Davis, 2002, De Sousa, 2003). Later this term is applied more broadly to describe spaces to be upgraded (Couch, Fraser, & Percy, 2008), and the concept is borrowed in this paper referring to spaces previously used for industrial purpose while currently for non-compliant uses and are to be upgraded.",

Both the number and the proportion of wholesale conversion have increased. In this regard, the policy has achieved its intended objective to some extent. Shown by Fig. 4\n, most of these cases are located at Kwan Tong, Cheung Sha Wan and Kwai Tsing, and there is a trend that these revitalisation cases spatially spread out gradually year by year from the districts closer to centre with highest accessibility and better quality of built environment to more remote areas with greater development potential. This phenomenon is not new: it has been tested by experiences both from the West and the East (Andres & Gr\u00e9sillon, 2011).

The expectation of a rising prices after this new round of revitalisation measures further intensifies short-term speculation. Using the prices in 1999 as a benchmark, the rising of price indices of flatted factories is even higher than all the other kinds of property including domestic, office and retail property. Although the government reorganised this problem and announced the Buyer Stamp Duty and Special Stamp Duty in 2012 and 2013 respectively to inhibit short-term speculative activities, both the rental and prices of private flatted factories decreased slightly and still remains quite high (Fig. 6).",

Originally, cheap industrial spaces have served as nurturing grounds and the last shelters for these groups. High-density flatted industrial buildings concentrated in old industrial areas provide them with cheap rent or operation costs. The users can share cheap supply of production and usually enjoy convenient transportation with low living costs there. These industrial buildings nurture small business and shelter urban poor. However, the rising rental and prices of industrial buildings further narrowed down their living spaces. Some of them have been driven out from traffic-convenient location such as Kwun Tong in Kowloon to outer areas because of the vacating process to make way for revitalisation or because of unaffordable increasing rent in those areas (validated by data obtained from interviews with local artists conducted in March 2013, October 2013, and November 2013).",

However, under Hong Kong's high-density development mode, fragmented ownership and technical difficulties have contributed to a high threshold of capital in revitalisation of flatted industrial buildings. The Booming speculation and rapidly rising prices make the situation worse and lead to an extremely high capital threshold in revitalisation. The driven up costs of revitalisation projects frustrates some real estate developers' incentives for application (validated by data obtained in interview with a real estate developer in Hong Kong, November 2013).",

Let us show you two more cases. To make space for the construction of new public transportation infrastructure in Mong Kok, Water Supplies Department of the Hong Kong Government planned to relocate its offices in Mong Kok, Kowloon, to an industrial building. However, with the rapid and high rising of prices of flatted factories since the new revitalisation measures, the costs were extremely out of budget and the plan thus failed in January 2013. Another case is failure of the first redevelopment project of industrial building by the Urban Renewal Authority, the statutory body that established under the Urban Renewal Authority Ordinance to replace the Land Development Corporation to undertake, encourage, promote and facilitate the regeneration of the older urban areas of Hong Kong. The Urban Renewal Authority planned to redevelop an industrial building in the Hong Kong Island into public housing. The acquisition negotiation lasted for more than half a year. Again, with the high rising of prices, property owners of some units suddenly raised their price. In consideration of the costs and benefits, the Urban Renewal Authority formally withdrew the project in June 2013. Not only the Urban Renewal Authority, but also the Water Supplies Department of the Government has become third parties affected by the new revitalisation measures. This is in conflict with the policy targets of the 2010 new revitalisation measures to make better use of vacant and underused industrial spaces.",

These responses then change the policy background instantly, leading to policy lag and thus threaten policy effectiveness. Since the aim of revitalising industrial buildings in Hong Kong at the very beginning is for the re-building of urban competitiveness, it is necessary to discuss policy effectiveness from a perspective of urban competitiveness. Adopting a perspective of urban competitiveness and based on the experience of Hong Kong, we would like to generalise some key principles and goals that should be taken into account in revitalising industrial spaces. There are many factors determining urban competitiveness. For the case of Hong Kong, we would like to highlight four key words\u2014industrial diversity, indigenously owned companies, social costs and quality of life.",

The all-in-one basket strategy is dangerous, and a city of relative higher industrial diversity could have larger resilience when encounter a crisis. The international competitiveness of the firms located in a place determines the competitiveness of that place partially (Rondinelli & Vastag, 1997: 347\u2013366). Special attention should also be paid on the ownership and decision-making power of companies. A competitive city should be able to gain control over its future, choosing among alternative futures rather than passively accepting its lot (Kresl & Singh, 1999). Accordingly, the focus centres on the issue of ownership and decision-making power of companies. Begg (1999, 802) argues this point in detail stressing that \u201ccities with a preponderance of indigenously owned companies will be more competitive than those where external control dominates\u201d. Therefore, the key words \u201cindustrial diversity\u201d and \u201cindigenously owned companies\u201d together describe the situation that a city of relative higher industrial diversity and more local companies will be less easily impacted by changes of macro environment. Yet, for Hong Kong with service industrial taking up more than 90% of its GDP, there is still much space for improvement in regard of this point (Lau, 2003, Tsang, 1999).",

To date, particular attention has been given to the city's sustainable development and improvement of quality of life of local residents as the ultimate goal of urban competitiveness. Likewise, revitalisation of industrial buildings should not overemphasise economic dimension and neglecting the consequent social costs. More important, improving quality of life of local residents as well as sustainable urban development should be set as one of the ultimate targets in revitalisation policy. Through revitalising industrial buildings, the Hong Kong government dedicates to better use of land resources and economic development. Yet, current revitalisation measures of industrial buildings overemphasised economic dimension and neglect social costs. With more and more industrial buildings revitalised for office, hotel and commercial uses, low-income local artist, small business and urban poverty occupying industrial buildings are gradually driven out, but the poverty problem is not solved. What is more, this has intensified conflicts between users, developers and the Government. Currently, little evidence has been found that quality of life of local residents has been improved.",
