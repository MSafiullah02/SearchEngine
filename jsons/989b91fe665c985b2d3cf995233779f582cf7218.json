Approximately 90% of neonates with congenital CMV infection are \"asymptomatic,\" meaning that they are well-appearing and have no clinically apparent signs of disease detected at birth. Since these infants have a normal physical examination, they often are not evaluated with laboratory or neuroimaging studies. In some cases, abnormalities detected on such tests, if performed, may reclassify them as \"symptomatic,\" thereby increasing the risk of hearing loss and disabilities from the 5 to 10% seen in asymptomatic infants [7, 8] .",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the frequency of abnormal findings on laboratory, ophthalmologic, neuroimaging, and audiologic evaluation performed on neonates who had a normal physical examination and were diagnosed with congenital CMV infection, the majority of which occurred in the setting of recognized primary maternal infection.",

We found that as many as 56% of neonates with congenital CMV infection and a normal physical examination had abnormalities that would reclassify them as \"symptomatic.\" Among the laboratory tests performed, the most frequent finding was a mildly elevated serum ALT concentration even though no infant had signs of hepatitis including hepatomegaly.

Only four infants who had more than one neuroimaging test performed had abnormalities on at least one of them (Table 3) . Cranial computerized tomography was abnormal in one of two infants, in which it was performed, and it demonstrated thalamic calcifications when the cranial ultrasound showed lenticulostriate vasculopathy (Table 3 , patient #3). Similarly, MRI showed thalamic calcifications on one infant whose cranial ultrasound demonstrated lenticulostriate vasculopathy ( Table 3 , patient #3), while in a second infant (Table 3 , patient #2), it showed periventricular calcifications and temporal lobe hyperlucency even though the ultrasound was normal. Sensorineural hearing loss occurred in 21% of evaluated patients, higher than the 5-10% that has been reported previously among asymptomatic infants [25] . This likely represented selection bias as targeted CMV screening for referred hearing screen was performed during the study period. The fact that the hearing loss was moderate to severe in six (86%) infants and bilateral in three (43%) infants highlights the importance of targeted CMV screening of infants who refer on the newborn hearing screen [11, [26] [27] [28] . Unfortunately, this study did not include data on late-onset hearing loss which can occur in an additional 15-25% of CMV-infected infants [7] .",

Since the study included infants born since 1996, there may be a time bias with respect to management of these infants, as antiviral therapy has become more accepted with convenient oral administration. The latter may be a likely reason for the valganciclovir treatment of three infants in Buenos Aires who had a normal evaluation. In addition, 62% of the mothers in this convenience sample of CMV-infected infants were diagnosed with CMV during the pregnancy, and therefore the infants may have been more likely to have abnormalities than if they had been born to mothers with CMV reactivation. Nevertheless, 90% of these infants would have been expected to be \"asymptomatic\" as their physical examination and growth parameters suggested. Regardless, abnormalities detected on evaluation were not infrequent, suggesting that optimal classification of CMV-infected neonates to predict risk of sensorineural hearing loss will require such testing. In addition, infants did not have blood CMV DNA PCR testing that may help predict hearing outcomes [35] . Finally, the lack of an uninfected control group of infants may have resulted in an overestimate of the abnormalities attributable to congenital CMV infection, especially among the five preterm infants whose abnormal findings could have been related to prematurity. However, none of the term infants were diagnosed with other conditions that could have explained the abnormalities noted on laboratory, ophthalmologic, and neuroimaging evaluation.",
