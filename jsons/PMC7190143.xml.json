            "text": "The ZIP code paradigm says that the place where a person lives is a more critical health predictor than their genetic code [1]. In fact, at the individual level, the relationship between the socioeconomic status (SES) and the prevalence of chronic diseases presents an evident inverse linear gradient [2]. In other words, as SES improves, prevalence diminishes correspondingly. This gradient is reliable and consistent in the relationship found with cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, chronic respiratory tuberculosis, and adverse birth outcomes, as well as violent and accidental deaths [2]. However, individual conditions are not enough to fully explain spatial variation in disease rates and the relationship between social inequalities and health. Area-based studies show that the socioeconomic conditions of places also affect people's health [3\u20135]. Thus, understanding which characteristics of the socioeconomic environment most explain health conditions is a pressing issue. Such understanding can contribute to the implementation of intersectoral public policies that would be more efficient to improve the health of the population and to reduce inequalities. As individual measures of socioeconomic indicators are rarely available in medical records [6], it is common to use a single geographical variable that summarizes living conditions (e.g., income, education, per capita Gross Domestic Product). Although this approach helps to understand how an aspect of the socioeconomic context is related to health, the interpretation of the findings is limited, as the socioeconomic context is multidimensional, involving aspects such as employment, income, education, housing, segregation, mobility, among others [7].",

The Human Development Index calculated by the municipality level (HDI-M) [10], is the most often used on the national scale. In addition to presenting construct validity and reliability, it allows for international comparability. However, this index expresses how much the development process guaranteed access to education and culture, conditions of enjoying a long and healthy life, and having an adequate standard of living for the population [11]. Although in practice it has helped to identify development inequalities among Brazilian municipalities, there is mathematical redundancy when it is applied to explain health outcomes by regression models. The HDI longevity component measures the life expectancy at birth, comprising health conditions and risks to morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is a lack of a synthetic index of socioeconomic conditions prepared from theoretical references for health studies in Brazil.",

We developed the new index for use at three aggregation scales: national (GeoSES-BR), Federative Unit (GeoSES-FU) and intra-municipal (GeoSES-IM, for the 140 municipalities with three or more census sample areas). Without loss of generality, here we present the application on national and intra-municipal scales.",

Thus, we created the synthetic index by selecting the variables contained in the questionnaire applied to the sample during the 2010 Population Census, comprising about 11% (6,400,000 units) of the Brazilian households.",

            "text": "The dimension income may influence the etiology of several health outcomes, in part, through mechanisms that involve the acquisition of material resources. Education can reflect non-economic features as general and health-related knowledge, the capacity of problem-solving, prestige, influence, social network and access to technological innovation [15] that can bring advantages to the individual\u2019s health [9]. Poverty refers to absolute poverty, directly linked to the minimum capacity of survival and access to material resources. Wealth, on its turn, is different from income, since it is a proxy for all long-life economic resources [9]. Our definition of material deprivation and access to public services bases on Townsend\u2019s concept of material deprivation [16] that refers to disadvantages concerning other people in the same society to which one belongs. We intend to measure how much material resources and conveniences that are part of modern life (such as adequate housing, car ownership, refrigerator, computer, among others) a person has, also evaluating their access to services, including sanitation, electricity, and internet. Mobility can affect a person's health in many ways. One of them concerns the time spent commuting from home to work, which can cause stress on many levels and compromise the time available for study or leisure. In addition, longer commuting time may expose people to higher doses of air pollution in large cities [17]. Finally, residential segregation is a broad concept that refers to housing separated from different population groups in different parts of a city [18]. Segregation affects health by intensifying psychosocial effects involving insecurity, anxiety, social isolation, socially dangerous environments, bullying, and depression [14,19,20]. In our analysis, we considered two aspects of segregation: education and income, including levels of income stratified by ethnic groups, which better describe socioeconomic differences in Brazil. We used the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) to measure residential segregation [14]. Consider the income segregation as an example: the formula uses the number of people who earns more than the 80% percentile, minus the number who earns less than the 20% percentile, divided by the total number of people who have income. The ICE varies from -1 (most deprived) to 1 (most privileged). A negative ICE means that the area presents more people in the condition of deprivation than in the higher extreme; and a positive value, the opposite. A value of zero indicates that the area is not dominated by extreme concentrations of either of the two groups. The calculations of the other segregation types follow the same formula.",

In this sense, using the most recent data, from 2013 to 2017, helps to reduce uncertainty since data quality has been improving year by year in Brazil. The second point concerns the intra-municipal scale. At this scale, for which death data are of high quality in the municipality of S\u00e3o Paulo, we chose to study deaths related to circulatory system diseases (ICD-10: I00-I99), since this is an outcome admittedly known to be associated with socioeconomic conditions.

We used the geographic coordinates of the municipal headquarters in the analyzes for Brazil and the displaced coordinates of the sample areas for the intra-municipal analyzes of S\u00e3o Paulo. In this case, the displacement was made due to the heterogeneity of the population distribution in the peripheral sample areas, where there are dams and environmental protection sparsely populated areas. Due to the occurrence of spatial dependence on residues at both aggregation scales, we applied geographically weighted regression (GWR) models calculated in the ArcGIS 10.1 program (\u201cAdaptive\u201d Kernel analysis; Bandwidth Parameter method, with 53 neighbors on the national scale, and 30 in the intra-municipal). GWR is a regression that allows exploring spatial heterogeneity on data, which exists when the process being modeled varies across the study area. We evaluated the models via resulting AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values, according to which lower values indicate a better fit of the model [29]. A spatial model with good fit should yield no spatial autocorrelation on its residues meaning that the most important variables explaining spatial variability were addressed. To verify spatial dependence on the residues, we calculated the Moran\u2019s I coefficients for the standardized residuals and their p values in the GeoDa program. Moran\u2019s I coefficient measures the likelihood that an apparent spatial pattern was produced merely by chance or if there is an effect of distance on the distribution of a variable. The coefficient ranges from -1 to 1 and is equal to zero when there is no effect of the distance. We used a \u201cQueen\u201d neighborhood matrix, a contiguity-based relation due to the presence of irregular polygons with varying shape and surface (municipalities and sample areas). First-order Queen contiguity defines a neighbor when they have at least a point in common on their border. A significant spatial pattern was defined when p <0.05.",

Models with the dimensions of poverty, deprivation, income, and segregation best explained the relative risk of avoidable mortality from 5 to 74 years in Brazil, without spatial dependence on their residues. Among the dimensions of this index, the model that most explains the spatial variability of risk is with the poverty dimension (Table 2). The map in Fig 3 shows the observed risks and the risks explained by GeoSES-BR/poverty. The mobility dimension was not a deterministic criterion to characterize socioeconomic differences on the national scale and did not contribute to GeoSES-BR. Almost 44% of the spatial variability is explained by the model with the poverty dimension, which can be realized by the visual similarity among the observed and explained maps. The most striking differences among them occur in the Northern portion of the country where observed risks (map A) are higher than expected (map B) due to the socioeconomic context. This difference may be due to health assistance or another factor not addressed in the model that should be further investigated.",

In this sense, the most explanatory variable is not arbitrary, but the most discriminating, and may differ according to the region under analysis (national, state, and municipal). It brings an innovative and insightful perspective for understanding what is most relevant in the socioeconomic context of each Brazilian region. For example, the most significant dimension at the national level is poverty; for S\u00e3o Paulo state, it is the residential segregation of the educational context; for the state of Rio Grande do Norte, income is the most critical dimension. Taking the sample area as an example, when comparing the principal variable in the education dimension, in the municipality of S\u00e3o Paulo, the percentage of people with superior level is the variable for discrimination among areas while in the municipality of Salvador (Bahia) is the percentage of people in the low educational level. Segregation seems to be central in the intra-municipal settings of the metropolitan areas, while mobility may be more relevant in other-sized municipalities.

Associations between distal social determinants and population health depend on the time lags between exposure to these risk factors and their effects on different types of health outcomes [33]. Thus, lags are widely variable. For instance, for acute or infant mortality, it makes sense to have proximity between both health and socioeconomic population data. For chronic diseases, on the other hand, lags of 20 years are expected to be more plausible [34].

Actually, this is an advantage of the index, since the theoretical background of the dimensions is preserved even if there are changes in the variables among censuses. Regarding cuts in the next Census, the experimental questionnaires last available (June 2019) show a significant reduction in questions about household features and its surroundings.
