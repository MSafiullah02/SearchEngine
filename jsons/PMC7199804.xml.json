On January 11, 2020, after pathogenic nucleic acid testing, China reported 41 cases of pneumonia that were infected with the novel coronavirus [2]. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed the novel coronavirus epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [3]. As of February 20, 2020, a total of 75,465 confirmed cases and 2236 deaths have been reported in mainland China [4]. The novel coronavirus has caused great challenges and threats to public health in China and has quickly become the focus of worldwide attention. Information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly online, especially on social media.",

The research has involved topics such as epidemiological research [5-7], diagnostic methods for COVID-19 [8-11], clinical characteristics of the disease [12-16], characteristics of disease transmission [17-19], development of candidate therapies [20-22], and the identification of animal hosts [22-26]. However, there has been no research conducted on the public\u2019s attention to COVID-19. Since public participation is required to prevent and control the epidemic spread of infectious diseases, it is extremely important to learn about the public\u2019s attention toward COVID-19 during the current epidemic. Such knowledge is of great significance when guiding people to respond appropriately to the epidemic and helping them learn how to cope with the sudden infectious diseases such as COVID-19, and it also supports social stability [27].",

Increasing numbers of public health departments and individuals are using social media platforms to communicate and share information during public health emergencies. Social media has become an important channel for promoting risk communication during the crisis [28,29]. The use of social media to measure public attention has also been gradually applied to research on infectious diseases such as H7N9 [27,30,31], Ebola [28,32-36], Zika virus [29,37,38], Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus [39], and Dengue fever [40]. In addition, to help countries respond better to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the WHO has issued operational planning guidelines, requiring countries to take specific actions around the eight pillars. Risk Communication and Community Engagement, one of the eight pillars, plays an important role in health emergencies and requires the promotion of active public communication to clear public confusion and misunderstanding [41]. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Sina Microblog, the main social media platform in China, has become increasingly important for the public to communicate about the COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, it is of immediate importance for governments and nongovernmental organizations to study the public\u2019s attention toward the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog.",

The first cases had appeared successively throughout the country, and the number of confirmed cases was increasing. The outbreak of COVID-19 made the people and the government aware of the importance of prevention. People began to buy masks, and governments at all levels initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies.

In stage B, the majority of the hot search topics were neutral; however, 27.2% (n=174/639) of the hot search topics showed negative emotions, with 0.3% (n=2) being highly negative and 3.6% (n=23) being moderately negative, while positive emotions accounted for 13.3% (n=85).

However, there have been no relevant studies that have incorporated social media analysis into the public response to the COVID-19 epidemic. We used the Sina Microblog hot search list to analyze the public\u2019s attention toward the COVID-19 epidemic from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, which was 52 days after the first disclosure of COVID-19 by the Chinese health department. There were four main findings from this study. First, we analyzed the changing trend of public attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of the public\u2019s attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the public\u2019s emotional tendency toward the hot search topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic changed from negative to neutral across the study period. As a whole, negative emotions weakened, and positive emotions increased. Fourth, we divided the topics of public concern about the COVID-19 epidemic into five categories through social semantic network analysis. This study analyzes the public\u2019s response and attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic, which will help public health professionals monitor public response, identify public needs as early as possible, make timely public health prevention and control measures, and disseminate knowledge to citizens in a targeted manner to better respond to the current COVID-19 epidemic.",

            "text": "From December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, the public attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog can be divided into three stages. In the beginning, there was little public attention paid to the epidemic, and then the concentration of attention increased. Next, the public attention given to the epidemic generally declined, but people continued to pay attention. In the first stage (December 31, 2019, to January 18, 2020), the Chinese public paid less attention, as COVID-19 was only reported in Wuhan, China. On January 19, 2020, suspected cases appeared in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and body temperatures began to be measured at the Wuhan Airport and Railway Station. People began to notice the severity of the epidemic, and the level of attention paid to the COVID-19 epidemic began to increase until January 26, 2020. We can see that when the epidemic began to spread across the country, the public responded quickly to news about the COVID-19 outbreak on Sina Microblog [39]. This is because COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, which means that no effective treatment has been found and no corresponding vaccine has been developed. When the outbreak began, the public was eager to search for relevant knowledge and information online to meet their own protection needs [27,30]. In the third stage (January 27 to February 20, 2020), although the number of cases of COVID-19 were still increasing, the number of Sina Microblog topics and their search volume were decreasing. The reason for this may be because the epidemic information was relatively saturated, and it was difficult for people to acquire more new knowledge through a Sina Microblog search [27]. It may also be that people were no longer paying close attention to the epidemic dynamic to gain a sense of security as time went on, and the public\u2019s consciousness tends to be rational [52].",

From the hot search keywords of each stage, we found that the public did not know much about the virus and its causes in the first stage. The main keywords of the search to seek relevant knowledge were \u201cunknown cause\u201d and \u201cnovel coronavirus.\u201d During the second stage, the epidemic began to spread throughout the country, the first cases were reported in different areas successively, and the number of confirmed cases continued to increase, thereby making the public and government aware of the importance of prevention. During the third stage, the epidemic spread widely throughout the country; Wuhan was the most seriously affected area, and the city was locked down. The public\u2019s attention was mainly shifted to material donation and medical assistance in Wuhan. Compared with qualitative research, it is more accurate to obtain the hot spots of public attention through keyword frequency analysis, as this process has a higher accuracy and more credibility in the research of hot spots and their development trends [40]. Based on our high-frequency keyword analysis of the Sina Microblog topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic, we can obtain information about the concerns and opinions of Sina Microblog users at different stages [53]. Studies have found that people\u2019s interest in infectious diseases on social media was linked to the latest news and major events. Studies have also shown that people will pay attention to and search for disease-related words as the spread of infectious diseases change [30].",

On the whole, negative emotions weakened, and positive emotions increased. Previous studies have pointed out that there is also an important relationship between emotions and content on social media [54]. The content analysis of social networks has identified people\u2019s attitudes or reactions to specific health hazard events [30,39]. In the first stage, there was less public attention given to the Sina Microblog hot search list. Most of the topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic were about the notification of pneumonia and the virus, and the emotions tended to be negative. At that time, the public had a strong demand for information on public health emergencies such as infectious diseases. When the information demand could not be fully satisfied, the users\u2019 emotions were negative [40]. As the epidemic progressed to the second and third stages, the public sentiment tended to be neutral because increasingly more news was being reported at this stage, and objective events became the mainstream information on the Sina Microblog hot search list. The public reduced their previous levels of worries and fears about the epidemic; their negative feelings weakened, and their positive emotions increased. More hot search topics mentioned information about prevention or protection, which is conducive to public health communication and promotion.",

From the search of the subject content, we can see that during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the public, the news media, and the health department all actively used Sina Microblog as a platform for disseminating information related to COVID-19 [29], indicating that Sina Microblog is a communication channel for both individuals and organizations to publicize COVID-19 symptoms, preventive measures, and related policies [37]. In addition, as a real time and extensive online platform, Sina Microblog provides a channel for information dissemination. For example, in this emergency outbreak, the public has made good use of the platform to find fellow passengers with confirmed cases, thereby playing an important role in preventing and controlling the disease transmission.",

Second, we only used Sina Microblog as the social media platform in this study, the data source for this study is relatively narrow. Considering that China is seriously aging and that the majority of internet users are young people, the age of Sina Microblog users is mainly concentrated in those 18-41 years [42], which cannot represent the population of all ages in China. Therefore, selection bias is inevitable in this study. On the other hand, the study excludes other popular social media data sources such as WeChat and ByteDance and is limited to the publicly available data on the Sina Microblog hot search list. Moreover, due to the lack of detailed information about the users who contributed to the search volume of the Sina Microblog hot search list, we could not describe the social demographic information of the Sina Microblog users, and we failed to obtain the geospatial distribution of Sina Microblog active users.

Therefore, misinformation can be easily propagated and spread on social media. Apart from traditional \u201ctop-down\u201d public health communication, provider-managed communication platforms such as WebMD (America), AskDr (Singapore), and HaoDF (China) can be used as an additional countermeasure available to develop a ground-up response to this issue. HaoDF [56], one of the largest doctor-patient communication platforms in China, launched an online free consultation service for COVID-19 during this epidemic. Doctors answered questions online for free 24 hours a day to help the public make a preliminary judgment about the disease and avoid blind medical treatment caused by panic. In addition, HaoDF summarized the common questions and answers of COVID-19 to let the public know more about the epidemic. These are the forms of responses, as potential solutions to avoid an infodemic, that governments can engage with, researchers can study, and innovators can develop in the future.",
