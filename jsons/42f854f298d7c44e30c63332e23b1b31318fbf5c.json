Implants fabricated from titanium and titanium alloys are considered the gold standard in the field of oral implantology (Abraham, 2014) However, there are increased concerns that titanium can release metal ions and contribute to varying degrees of local allergic reactions, which have been suggested as a potential factor in dental implant failures that are often misdiagnosed (Chaturvedi, 2013; Harloff et al., 2010) In the presence of high smile line, titanium can pose an esthetic risk, particularly in cases of thin gingival biotype and/or gingival recession (Cosyn, Thoma, Hmmerle, & De Bruyn, 2017; \u00d6zkurt & Kazazo\u011flu, 2011) Additionally, the demand for metal-free reconstructions is burgeoning.

However, mechanical stresses and wetness exposure may have detrimental effects on mechanical properties of zirconia. The exact effect of aging on zirconia is not yet well known. Besides, zirconia implants may be associated with even higher stress peaks to the surrounding bone compared with titanium, due to its higher elastic modulus (210 GPa) (Andreiotelli & Kohal, 2009; Cionca, Hashim, & Mombelli, 2017; Lughi & Sergo, 2010) .

Considering the closer match of mechanical properties of PEEK to bone, the stress shielding of PEEK dental implants is less than that of titanium. The process involves reduction in bone volume around an implant due to the shielding effect of physiologic loads by the implant. PEEK is biocompatible, resistant to chemical degradation, high temperatures exceeding 300\u00b0C and exhibits strength properties that are comparable to some metals (Kurtz & Devine, 2007) However, when using PEEK as an implant substrate, the greatest challenge is represented by bio-inertness of the material. Based on in vitro studies, unmodified PEEK was proven to be inherently hydrophobic in nature, with a water-contact angle of 80-90\u00b0, which will affect the proliferation rate of surrounding cells (Thomas & Cook, 1985; Winkler & Mekayarajjananonth, 1999) . A study comparing titanium, PEEK, and zirconia implant materials revealed that PEEK has the lowest bone implant contact, consequently compromising its osseointegration (Koch et al., 2010) . Various techniques have been employed to improve the bioactivity of the material, among which are surface coating and surface treatment or a combination of both techniques (Ma & Tang, 2014) .

Using the BIC and BD ratios as parameter for the degree of osseointegration, it can be stated that aluminum blasting of CFP implants can improve bioactivity and osseointegration of material. Comparable BIC and BD values to that of titanium implants were observed for SCFP and significantly higher than that of UCFP. A thin bone layer covered a relatively large portion of the SCFP. This feature showed that surface roughness of PEEK implants created by aluminum blasting activated the migration, spreading, and proliferation of osteoblasts suggesting contact osteogenesis comparable BD values to titanium could give a lead for continuous bone remodeling in healing chambers and prognosis of implant stability when subjected to load(Molly, 2006).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
