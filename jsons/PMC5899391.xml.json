It has been revealed that mitochondrial transfer can restore the dysfunctional mitochondria in recipient cells, reprogram the differentiated cells, and even rescue the injured cells [22\u201324]. Spees et al. [25] first demonstrated that after coculture of A549 \u03c1\u00b0 cells (lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line with defective mtDNA) with MSCs, A549 \u03c1\u00b0 cells could acquire functional mitochondria from MSCs. Also, the isolated mitochondria from the immortalized, untransformed mammary epithelial MCF-12A cells could easily enter malignant breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and NCI/ADR-Res cells rather than entering MSF-12A itself. After mitochondrial transfer, the proliferation of these cell lines would be suppressed in a dose-dependent pattern, and the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin, abraxane, and carboplatin would be increased [26]. Intriguingly, vascular smooth muscle cells cocultured with MSCs induce upregulation of proliferation of MSCs through mitochondrial transfer [27].",

The mitochondrial components but not intact mitochondria are recognized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which induce strong proinflammatory reactions in the bloodstream and extracellular medium [28, 29]. For example, mtDNA released into extracellular space induces Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9-mediated inflammation and NRLP3-inflammasome activation [30, 31]. Collins et al. [32] injected mtDNA into mice joints, which results in inflammation and arthritis. Although the specific mechanisms remain unclear, adjusting the immune surveillance mechanisms of mtDNA and acquiring intact functional mitochondria may promote exogenous mitochondrial donation for therapeutic purposes.",

Recently, evidence indicated that injured neurons are able to capture functional mitochondria from astrocytes [33]. CD38/CADPR/Ca2+ signaling may help astrocytes transfer mitochondria into neurons and promote survival and plasticity. In addition, Hayakawa et al. [34] collected extracellular mitochondria particles from primary mouse cortical astrocytes and then directly injected them into peri-infarct cortex of mouse models of focal cerebral ischemia. After 24 h, results suggested that transplanted functional mitochondria were indeed present in neurons and cell survival signals were amplified. Furthermore, Yi et al. [35] also observed mitochondrial transfer during embryonic development. They collected mitochondria concentrates from murine hepatocytes, and then injected them into zygotes from older mice. There were better developmental outcomes in the injected group than in the control group, which showed that mitochondrial transfer can improve embryonic development. Moreover, replacement of mitochondria through nuclear transfer among oocytes has turned into a research focus recently on the strategy for preventing the inheritance of mtDNA diseases [36].",

            "text": "Stem cells are recognized as unexceptionable donor cells for mitochondrial transfer and numerous studies have substantiated the significance of mitochondrial transfer in stem cell therapy, especially MSCs [37]. The first evidence for mitochondrial transfer as an in-vivo therapeutic tool came from Islam et al.\u2019s study [38]. In the sepsis acute lung injury (ALI) model (airway-instilled E. coli LPS in anesthetized mice), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transferred mitochondria to the alveolar epithelium that increased the generation of ATP and alveolar surfactant that regulates alveolar stability. In such nonsterile inflammatory diseases, alveolar macrophages activated by LPS that are widely used to mimic Gram-negative bacterial infection can accept mitochondria from stem cells to reduce the production of inflammatory factor while increasing the phagocytic ability and the production of ATP [38, 39]. Lung alveolar macrophages had been shown to gain mitochondria from MSCs in both in-vitro and in-vivo models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that result in an enhancement of macrophage phagocytosis activity and an improvement of bioenergetics, providing evidence for the therapeutic potential of mitochondria in acute, inflammatory lung disease [40]. In addition, in viral infection, Guo et al. [41] found that the formation of TNTs could be induced via porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus between infected and uninfected cells, and mitochondria derived from stem cells transferred to infected cells depending on TNTs, which rescued infected cells from apoptosis/necrosis, whereas the mitochondria can be a vehicle to transport viral materials for spreading the infection.",

For instance, Naji et al. [45] indicated that the NLRP3\u2013ASC\u2013Caspase 1 axis induced via indium-tin-oxide nanoparticles in macrophages can provoke pyroptosis, while stem cells can inhibit the inflammatory process. In addition, MSCs rescue cardiomyoblasts from ischemia via direct cell-to-cell connections [46]. Li et al. [47] discovered that the devotion of mitochondria in MSCs provides great promise for the recovery of cigarette smoke (CS)-induced lung injury in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Meanwhile, it is reported that there is a higher mitochondrial transfer capacity in iPSC-MSCs than that from BMSCs to repair CS-induced mitochondrial damage. The reduction of the linear intercept value and the improvement in fibrosis were also greater in the group treated with iPSC-MSCs than in those treated with BMSCs [48]. Furthermore, mitochondrial transfer can also occur from MSCs to T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.",

It has been suggested that mitochondrial Rho-GTPase 1 (Miro1) may be convenient for the release of mitochondrial transfer. Ahmad et al. [51] first suggested that Miro1 as a calcium-sensitive adaptor protein regulates intercellular mitochondrial movement from MSCs to epithelial cells (ECs). The authors developed an in-vitro system of coculture of MSCs and ECs as well as an in-vivo system of mice treated with MSCs via the trachea. The mitochondrial transfer was related to a remarkable recovery of impairment of mitochondrial function. Interestingly, mitochondrial transfer could be blocked when MSCs were preinduced with rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. They then examined the levels of mitochondrial intracellular transport-related proteins and suggested that only Miro1 was associated with the mitochondrial transfer. In addition, MSCs with stronger capacity of mitochondrial transfer than lung ECs and fibroblasts expressed high levels of Miro1 as compared to them. They further showed that, compared to control MSCs, the replacement of mitochondria from MSCs in which Miro1 was knocked down to injured ECs was reduced. This decrease was not due to the amount of TNTs, but the mitochondrial motility through the nanotubules. Other research showed that Miro1 protein plays a significant role in Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondria, which subsequently affects mitochondrial movement [52]. In conclusion, Miro1 is an integral protein involved in mitochondrial release from MSCs to ECs and Miro1-overexpressing MSCs are efficient mitochondrial donors with enhanced rescue potential.",

            "text": "At present there are three regulations for mitochondrial transport inside cells, which is believed to be involved in mitochondria release. The first is synaptic activity-dependent regulation. Mitochondria are transported to activated synapses in response to two intracellular signals that control their velocity and recruitment into the stationary pool. Identification of the KIF5\u2013Milton\u2013MIRO complex provides molecular targets to address this issue and studies independently identified MIRO as a Ca2+ sensor, providing a potential mechanism underlying Ca2+-dependent regulation of mitochondrial mobility [53\u201355]. The second regulation is neuronal signaling-mediated regulation. In dorsal root ganglion neurons, nerve growth factor (NGF) can act as a docking signal, causing axonal mitochondria to accumulate close to an external source of NGF [56]. Actin-based mechanisms appear to also have a role in this phenomenon. When neurons are treated with inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or latrunculin B, an agent that destabilizes filamentous actin, mitochondria are not recruited to the NGF stimulation site, highlighting a crucial role for the PI3K signaling cascade in NGF-induced regulation of mitochondrial mobility. The third regulation of mitochondrial transport is related to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) [57]. Microtubules are dynamic structures and are stabilized by MAPs. Whereas MAP2 is specifically distributed in dendrites, MAP1B and tau are mainly axon-targeted MAPs. In addition to stabilizing axonal microtubules, tau has been shown to contribute to the regulation of the axonal transport of membrane organelles, including mitochondria [58]. Overexpressing tau in N2a and NB2a/d1 neuroblastoma cell lines, primary cortical neurons, and retinal ganglion neurons selectively inhibits kinesin-driven anterograde mitochondrial transport [58\u201360]. Recent studies have also revealed that the tau-mediated inhibition of axonal mitochondrial transport can be rescued by tau phosphorylation by MARK [61].",

It has been suggested that the CD38/CADPR/Ca2+ signaling pathway mediates the mitochondrial transfer from astrocytes into neurons [33]. Thus, it is worth exploring whether this signaling pathway similarly works in stem cells. Are there any other factors and other signal pathways regulating the release of mitochondria? We speculated that the microenvironment of injured regions may send messengers to the stem cells to initiate the transfer of mitochondria. For example, whether molecules such as proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-\u03b1) or anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10), which are released in the early stage of injured tissue, can be recognized by stem cells and result in promoting or inhibiting mitochondrial release. It is interesting to know that dysfunctional mitochondria derived from injured cells can be engulfed and degraded by MSCs, which can result in induction of the cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. As a result, stem cells are motivated and recruited, and then release their mitochondria to rescue the injured cells.",

            "text": "Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are small membranous tubes with 50\u20131000 nm in diameter, which originated from stem cells during mitochondrial transfer. TNTs are thin cytoplasmic extensions bordered by a plasma membrane and connecting cells. TNTs were initially described by Rustom et al. [62] as a communicating intercellular transport network formed in coculture of human 293 cells and rat PC12 cells. Later, TNT formation was also reported in immune cells, including B, T, and NK cells, neutrophils, and monocytes, as well as in neurons, glia, cultured prostate cancer cells, and cardiac myocytes. TNTs seem to be a key point for effective mitochondrial transfer, inhibiting abrogating the transmission of cytoplasmic material such as mitochondria from BMSCs to epithelial cells [24], while inhibiting the process of endocytosis or phagocytosis shows little effect [63]. Onfelt et al. [64] observed that thin filaments involving F-actin and also a thicker subset (0.7 \u03bcm) containing both F-actin and microtubules participated in the formation of TNTs. Meanwhile, M-sec, a mammalian protein, can induce formation of TNTs that only contain actin filaments, but without microtubules [65]. In addition, exchange of cell particles between injured cells and stem cells was required for the formation of TNTs [66]. It also was observed that filopodial extension and retraction by stem cells draws an extension of TNTs from cardiomyocytes [67]. Also, Cdc42 (a small GTPase) plays a critical role in the TNT extension process [65]. Furthermore, mitochondrial transfer can be induced via mitochondrial damage that releases ROS to activate NF-\u03baB and upregulate TNF\u03b1ip2, enhancing the formation of TNTs [68].",

On the other hand, in other cell systems, high concentrations of glucose stimulated the formation of TNTs [70, 71]. In addition, it was reported that other factors including low serum, acidic conditions, H2O2 stimulation, viral infection, or use of chemotherapeutic agents promoted the formation of TNTs [70\u201375].

Mitochondrial transfer was reduced by cytochalasin D (inhibitor of actin polymerization) and nocodazole (inhibitor of microtubule assembly) but not by chlorpromazine (inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis), revealing that cells acquired exogenous mitochondria via micropinocytosis (not via clathrin-mediated endocytosis) [79].

First, how to isolate intact and viable mitochondria from stem cells? Although the intact functional mitochondria can replace the damaged or defective mitochondria to rescue cell function, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), but not intact mitochondria, results in a series of immune responses. Thus, to adjust the isolation technique to acquire high-quality active intact mitochondria may promote exogenous mitochondrial donation for therapeutic purposes. Second, how to keep the activity of mitochondria in vitro? Are cryopreserved mitochondria as effective as fresh isolated mitochondria? Third, how to meet the requirement of a sufficient quantity of mitochondria? Fourth, which approach of mitochondria transplantation into individuals should be selected from intravenous or local injection? Fifth, the development of specific fluorescence and mitochondrial tracking tools is required for further detecting the occurrence of mitochondrial transfer in vivo. Recently, there was inspirational discovery of a new tool called MitoCeption to track the transplanted mitochondria, providing a facility for research or application [83]. In addition, using transgenic mitochondrial labeling such as tGFP may be a viable option for tracking transplanted mitochondria both in vitro and in vivo, since the inner mitochondrial membrane can be labeled with high transfection efficiency and expression stability [84]. Finally, the consequence and security of mitochondrial transfer from different kinds of stem cells need to be further explored and evaluated.",

In these conditions, damaged cells are capable of capturing healthy mitochondria from stem cells to produce ATP, alleviate the inflammatory response, reduce apoptosis, and eventually rescue the injured cells [67, 86, 87].
