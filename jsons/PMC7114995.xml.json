The detection method consists of a sensitive detection of horseradish peroxidise (HRP) activity coupled with Au NPs and FeDC to amplify the amperometric effect. This has the potential for further applications in the rapid pathogen detection. One important advantage of these amperometric immunosensing strips is that approximately 50 CFU of E. coli O157:H7 in milk samples can be detected in 1 h. In this same context, Zhang and co-workers [13] described a sensitive electrochemical immunoassay for rapid detection of E. coli by ASV based on core\u2013shell Cu@Au nanoparticles (NPs) as anti-E. coli antibody labels.",

After that, a magnetic field was applied for separating M NPs/E. coli aggregates (see Fig. 3.1a). The supernatants were removed and the remaining aggregates were washed thoroughly, stained with a fluorescent dye (PicoGreen), transferred to a glass slide, and imaged. Fluorescent microscopic imaging showed that E. coli can be detected (see Fig. 3.1b) with a limit of detection 104 cells/mL by obtaining a high capture of bacteria.\n",

Researchers have demonstrated a rapid and reliable test for the detection of E. coli, by using the SPR band associated with the coupling of the antibodies to the silver nanoshells [15]. This detection method has shown that the E. coli antibody interaction is extremely specific and that the presence of other microorganisms could not produce changes in the SPR band.

They immobilized monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) on polystyrene microwells and captured S. typhi bacteria by using a copper-enhanced Au NPs label coupled with anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). The amount of deposited copper was related to the amount of Au NP tag present, which was \u00adcontrolled by the amount of S. typhi attached to the polyclonal antibody\u2013\u00adcolloidal gold conjugate. Therefore, the anodic stripping peak current was linearly dependent on the S. typhi concentration with a detection limit as low as 98.9 CFU/mL with interest for real samples analysis with a low detection limit, high accuracy, and fast analysis time.",

For example, a method for analyzing combinatorial DNA arrays using oligonucleotide-modified gold nanoparticle probes and a conventional flatbed scanner has been studied by the Mirkin\u2019s group [54]. Labeling oligonucleotide targets (based on the anthrax lethal factor sequence) with nanoparticles rather than fluorophore probes substantially alters the melting profiles of the targets from an array substrate. This difference permits the discrimination of an oligonucleotide sequence from targets with single nucleotide mismatches with a selectivity that is over three times that observed for fluorophore-labeled targets. In addition, when coupled with a signal amplification method in which silver ions are reduced by hydroquinone to silver metal at the surfaces of the Au NPs, the sensitivity of this scanometric array detection system exceeds that of the analogous fluorophore system by two orders of magnitude.",

An example of this is the recent development of immunochromatographic strip for rapid detection of H9 subtype avian influenza viruses (H9 AIVs) [23].

This detection method is rapid and easy to operate without the requirement of special skills and equipment, which makes it a strip suitable for field detection. In addition, this generation of ICA allows doing multiple assays that can help to diagnostic of common poultry diseases, such as Newcastle disease, avian infectious bronchitis, avian infectious laryngotracheitis, etc. Another similar study has been reported by the same authors to detect IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of AIV subtypes (H5, H7 and H9) in chicken sera [56].",

Sharma et al. [26] have developed an amperometric immunosensor based on Au NPs/alumina sol\u2013gel modified SPEs for antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein-2 (PfHRP-2) by dripping Al2O3 sol\u2013gel on SPE followed by electrochemical deposition of Au NPs. The antibodies in rabbit serum sample were allowed to react with the PfHRP-2 protein which was immobilized on the modified SPE to form antigen-antibody immune complex (PfHRP-2/anti-PfHRP-2). The bound antibodies were quantified by alkaline phosphatase (AP) enzyme labeled secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit immunoglobulins-AP conjugate). Enzymatic substrate, 1-naphthyl phosphate was converted to 1-naphthol by AP and an electroactive product was quantified using amperometric technique. Figure 3.4 shows some results of this electrochemical detection.\n",
