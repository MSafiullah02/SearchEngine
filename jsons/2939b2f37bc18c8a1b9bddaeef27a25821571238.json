Tolstikova, A.G. Tolstikov, G.A. Tolstikov, 2007 , published in Vestnik Rossiiskoi Akademii Nauk, 2007 The development of medicinal preparations and their introduction into medical practice are long-term, interrelated, and complex processes. It often turns out that the more promising a preparation appears to be, the stronger (strange as it may seem) the impetus to perfect its properties. If we put aside such obvious reasons for this impetus as the desire to get rid of the harmful side effects of a preparation or (as with antibiotic and antiviral drugs) to break the resistance of microorganisms and viruses, quite an understandable and natural desire to improve the success achieved comes to the fore.",

The first one, which is characterized by a careful attitude to the chemical structure of a \"fortune preparation,\" proceeds from the fact that its insignificant alterations will result in some modified substances (\"modificants\") capable of manifesting the required activity in lower doses than the initial preparation does. In addition, there are hopes for the possible emergence of new useful properties in modificants, in particular, a substantial reduction in the toxic effect. The second approach does not suggest any changes in the chemical structure of a \"fortune preparation.\" It is based on creating medicinal formulations, in the composition of which the pharmacon is protected from its untimely destruction by the living body's metabolic processes, as well as on acquiring increased transport capacities with more clearly expressed affinity to the active receptor centers.",

            "text": "In critically comparing both approaches, note that the first one, which has become widespread in recent decades, is successfully used for upgrading preparations of special social significance and high cost. These are often preparations synthesized from natural (vegetable, microbial, and animal) raw materials. For example, the base of paclitaxel, an antitumor preparation, is a taxol alkaloid, derived from the metabolite of 10-deacetylbaccatin, contained in the needles of the English yew, Taxus baccata, whose cost is more than $300 000 per 1 kg. Synthetic transformations of taxol that do not disturb the molecule's tetracyclic frame, the carrier of its basic pharmacological properties, may differ in the complexity of their modifying fragment's structure. In particular, the preparation taxoprexin ( Fig. 1 ), now in its second phase of clinical trials, was obtained from a simple synthetic operation as the ether of taxol and polyenic acid. However, the synthesis of the preparation DJ-927, now being tested clinically, has required a more serious alteration of the taxol structure. Currently, we have promising results of clinical trials on ten new derivatives of taxol, while more than 20 derivatives are undergoing preclinical tests. This interest in taxol's structural modifications is rooted not in its high cost but in the uniqueness of its pharmacological activity, which has put it on top of a new class of cancerostatic drugs with an action mechanism related to control over the polymerization of tubuline.",

Among such effects we should primarily mention toxicity, which is characteristic of potent medicines applied in the chemotherapy of cancer and other severe diseases.

The essence of a new approach to the development of low-dose medicinal preparations based on the method of clathration (complex formation) of pharmacons with natural substances, glycosides, is presented. Medical compositions thus created contain an essentially lower therapeutic dose of an active substance, so they are less toxic and possess some new useful properties. DOI: 10.1134/S1019331607050012",

Another important reason for this interest is the availability of glycyrrhyzic acid, which is determined by considerable licorice-root procurement.

For example, introducing acyl substituents into hydroxyl groups of the carbohydrate part (Fig. 3 , track A) allowed us to obtain new agents (we named one niglizin) that formed the first group of highly effective inhibitors of the reproduction of Marburg virus, which causes acute hemorrhagic fever in humans with a high mortality rate. Moreover, niglizin, with the same activity as azidothymidine towards HIV-1, is superior to the latter in its HIV-2 inhibition effect. A combination of niglizin with azidothymidine (AZT) is a promising drug against AZT-resistant HIV mutants. Niglizin is also active as a synergic component in compositions with nevirapine, a well-known anti-HIV preparation.

Clathrates are primarily attractive in their basic activity in doses substantially (to 100 times) lower than the known therapeutic ones.

To assess the basic property of a medical preparation, the efficacy dose indicator (ED 50 ) was introduced, with which the 50%effect of a medical preparation is achieved. The notion of the therapeutic index range (ThIR) is determined by the LD 50 /ED 50 ratio and characterizes the range of human safe doses of medical preparations. The larger the ThIR value, the safer the medicinal preparation is.
