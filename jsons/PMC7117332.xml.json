            "text": "In mammals, there are four JAKs: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2, ranging in size from 120 to 140 kDa (Haan et al., 2006). JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas JAK3 expression is restricted to cells of the hematopoietic system. The JAK protein is pre-associated with cytokine receptors in the cytoplasmic side and is an important determinant of their levels and signaling potential (Haan et al., 2006). Upon cytokine binding, the receptor chains are brought into close proximity, leading to the juxtaposition of two JAK kinase domains and consequent trans-phosphorylation. Once activated, JAKs phosphorylate STAT proteins via Src homology 2 (SH2) domain interaction (Heim et al., 1995). Even though responding to different cytokines, JAKs selected by different receptors activate specific STAT members for defined functions (Haan et al., 2006).",

STATs are latent transcription factors located in the cytoplasm until activated. Each STAT member responds to a defined set of cytokines (Kuchipudi, 2015, O'Shea and Plenge, 2012, O'Shea et al., 2015). The seven STATs go through similar activation processes and exhibit global conservation in function (Stark and Darnell, 2012). In brief, ligand-mediated receptor multimerization leads to trans-phosphorylation of JAKs, which then create docking sites in the receptor for STATs and phosphorylate them. Phosphorylated STATs form homodimer or heterodimer complexes, followed by translocation into the nucleus by importins and binding to response element in DNA to activate or repress transcription of a defined set of genes (Stark and Darnell, 2012).",

In response to type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2), STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated, followed by heterodimer formation and then interaction with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form a heterotrimer known as interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) (Darnell et al., 1994) (Fig. 1\nA). The ISGF3 is translocated into nucleus and binds to interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in DNA to activate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Upon IFN-\u03b3 stimulation, activated STAT1 forms homodimers, followed by nuclear translocation and activation of gene expression via binding to interferon-gamma-activated-sequence (GAS) in DNA (O'Shea and Plenge, 2012). Type III IFNs also activate STAT1 and STAT2 for ISRE transactivation like type I IFNs (Zhou et al., 2007).",

            "text": "STAT3 is activated by many cytokines and had multiple functions including differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) and generation of CD8+ T cell memory response (Chen et al., 2006, O'Shea et al., 2015, Villarino et al., 2015). Numerous cytokines including IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-21, IL-22, IL-27, oncostatin M (OSM), IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), trigger STAT3 activation (Garbers et al., 2015, Kuchipudi, 2015). The IL-6 family of cytokines including IL-6, OSM, and LIF bind to the receptor complex containing the common glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and activate STAT3, known as gp130/JAK-STAT3 signaling (Fig. 2\n). STAT3 is needed for differentiation of follicular T helper and Th1 cells (Ray et al., 2014), as well as activation and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) (Park et al., 2004). Mutations in STAT3 cause autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome, a rare multisystem primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent bacterial infections in skin and lung and with abnormally high levels of IgE (Holland et al., 2007, Minegishi et al., 2007). STAT3 is indispensable for promoting host defense against virus infections. For instance, during Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection, STAT3 promotes the activation of CD8+ T cells response (Yu et al., 2013). It has been shown that gp130-STAT3 signaling is critical for the innate immune response against coxsackievirus B3 virus (CVB3) infection (Yajima et al., 2006). In addition, STAT3 plays a protective role in regulating virus-induced proinflammatory response, as shown in STAT3 knock-out studies (El Kasmi et al., 2006, Kobayashi et al., 2003, Matsukawa et al., 2003). Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus induces strong proinflammatory response in chickens via inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation (Kuchipudi et al., 2014).",

Infection of MARC-145 cells by moderate virulent PRRSV strains VR-2332 and VR-2385 also result in KPNA1 reduction, whereas the Ingelvac\u00ae PRRS MLV does not. Nsp1\u03b2 of VR-2385 induces elevation of KPNA1 ubiquitination and shortening of its half-life. Analysis of nsp1\u03b2 deletion constructs identifies its N-terminal domain to be involved in the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA1 (Wang et al., 2013b). Sequence analysis of nsp1\u03b2 from VR-2332 and MLV indicates there are only two different nucleotides, leading to two variable amino acids at residue 19 and 151. Substitution of the N-terminal nucleotide resulting in alteration of residue 19 from valine to isoleucine abolishes the ability of VR-2385 nsp1\u03b2 to induce KPNA1 degradation and to inhibit IFN-mediated signaling. In contrast, MLV nsp1\u03b2 has no effect on KPNA1, however, a mutant MLV nsp1\u03b2 with residue 19 alternation from isoleucine to valine gains the ability to induce KPNA1 degradation (Wang et al., 2013b). These data demonstrate that nsp1\u03b2 blocks ISGF3 nuclear translocation to inhibit JAK-STAT signaling via inducing KPNA1 degradation and that the residue valine-19 in nsp1\u03b2 correlates with the inhibition.",

The N protein inhibits IFN-activated signaling by blocking STAT1 nuclear translocation (Wang et al., 2013a). Among PRRSV strains, there are variable effects on the IFN-activated JAK-STAT signaling. In MARC-145 cells, PRRSV strains VR-2385, VR-2332, NVSL97-7895, and Lelystad, but not MN184, block the activity of exogenous IFN-\u03b1 (Wang et al., 2013a). In primary PAMs, strain VR-2385, VR-2332, MN184, and Lelystad, but not NVSL, inhibit the activity of IFN-\u03b1. For NVSL97-7895 and MN184, the same virus infection in MARC-145 and PAM cells has variable effects on the IFN-activated signaling. This is not totally unexpected as NVSL strain differs from other PRRSV strains in its failure to induce IL-10 expression in vivo (Subramaniam et al., 2011). These two strains might have alternative interacting mechanisms with the JAK-STAT signaling in the two types of cells.",

Thus STAT3 has been found to be the target of some viral pathogens. Measles virus V protein inhibits IL-6 mediated STAT3 signaling (Ulane et al., 2003). V protein of mumps virus prevents responses to IL-6 and v-Src by inducing STAT3 ubiquitination and degradation (Ulane et al., 2005). Rabies virus interferon antagonist P protein inhibits gp130 receptor signaling by interacting with activated STAT3 (Lieu et al., 2013). Inhibition of STAT3 signaling by these viruses and PRRSV can lead to inhibition of a broad spectrum of cytokines and growth factors to thwart host antiviral responses and allow virus replication and spread in vivo.",

Minimizing the interference is expected to improve the host immune response to PRRSV infection. Indeed, PRRSV strain A2MC2, which induces type I IFNs in infected cells in vitro and has no inhibitory effect on IFN signaling (Nan et al., 2012), elicits higher virus-neutralizing antibodies than the MLV in pigs (Wang et al., 2013c). Site-directed mutagenesis of R128 and R129 of nsp1\u03b2 reduced its inhibition of IFN induction and leads to improvement of innate and adaptive immune responses (Li et al., 2016).",

STAT3 is needed for activation and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and plasmacytoid DCs are considered to be the major source of IFN-\u03b1 production during viral infection. STAT3 deficiency affects the generation of memory CD8+ T cells (Cui et al., 2011, Siegel et al., 2011) and memory B cells (Avery et al., 2010, Deenick et al., 2013). PRRSV infection induces a weak cell-mediated immune response, in which PRRSV-specific T cells transiently appears two weeks after infection without a change in frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (Xiao et al., 2004). The STAT3 antagonizing may be one of the reasons for PRRSV interference with the development of protective immune response.",
