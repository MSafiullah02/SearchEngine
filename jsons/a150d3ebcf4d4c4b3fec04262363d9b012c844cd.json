The material consisted of data based on serum specimens from about 58,500 patients. All ages from newborn infants to 90-yearolds were represented. The sera had been collected and tested with a CF screening test over a period of 8 years (1971)(1972)(1973)(1974)(1975)(1976)(1977)(1978). Several different antibody prevalence patterns were distinguished in regard to the rapidity and timing of the initial increase of the prevalence, as well as to the mode of later changes in prevalence. For most respiratory viruses a rapid increase of the prevalence was seen through the childhood continuing, for some of them, up to the 30s (influenza A and coronavirus), while rather variable patterns were found in the older age groups. Herpes simplex and cytomegaloviruses showed, interestingly, another type of pattern: a slow increase of prevalence continuing through the whole age range. The frequency of herpes simplex antibodies reached 90% by the age of 80 years. Antibody levels against any antigen in infants less than one-month-old were equal to those in 20-to 40-year-old adults, and the expected rapid decrease of antibodies took place within the first 6 months of life.

On the other hand, an almost identical prevalence pattern compared with our investigation was reported from London [Hambling, 19641 . These differences are most likely due to presence or absence of widespread epidemics during the study, which can clearly be seen in our material covering a period of 8 years. It is interesting to note that despite the apparent heavy epidemic in 1977 to 1978, the prevalence of RSV antibodies decreased steadily from 1976 (73%) to 1978 (45%).

The observed similarity to parainfluenza viruses was somewhat unexpected, as mumps infection is thought to induce a lifelong immunity in most cases, whereas the parainfluenza viruses do not. However, the persistence of CF antibodies to mumps may be an indication of repeated external boosting by contacts with the virus irrespective of the clinical immunity status. The similarity of the antibody frequencies against paramyxoviruses may also partly be due to antigenic cross-reactions [DeMeio and Walker, 1957; Lennette et al, 1963; Penttinen and Cantell, 19671. There were two epidemics of mumps during the study period: in 1971, and in 1975 to 1976.

The increase in antibody prevalence appeared at two ages: A short period of rising antibodies was observed between 6 months and 2 years of age, then the prevalence remained steady up to the teen ages, when another period of increasing antibody frequency took place. Cytomegalovirus is known to infect most people primarily before 1 year of age [Leinikki et al, 19721, which is in agreement with the first peak in our prevalence curve. Thereafter, the increase of antibody frequency cannot be taken as a reflection of primary cytomegalovirus infections but it may result from boosting effects of reactivated infection.

From the computer files we found that the total number of acute viral infections (rising antibody titers in paired sera) was about 10% in this material. The most common diagnosis was influenza A, which accounted for 1-3% of the patients, while the other virus diagnoses were found in less than 1% of the patients. This means that in the case of influenza A, 97%-99% of the patients did not have a recent influenza A infection at the time of study and could be regarded as \"normal\" population. The respective percentages for the other viruses were more than 99 % . Furthermore, the patients were not selected for socioeconomic class due to the public health care system in Finland, and because our laboratory serves all types of hospitals and polyclinics, representing about two-thirds of the whole population.

The persistence of antibodies in adults is much more difficult to explain as it is probably a net result of several factors typical of each infective agent. These factors include the capability to induce chronic and latent recurring infections (herpes group), repeated epidemic exposures (influenza A and B), and antigen crossreactions (paramyxoviruses; enteroviruses).
