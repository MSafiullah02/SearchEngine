Their virion ranges from 80 to 120 nm in diameter and contains one molecule of RNA of approximately 30 kb (Weiss & Navas-Martin, 2005) . Transcription and replication of the coronaviral RNA genome takes place in the cytoplasm of the host cell at replication sites that are associated with a characteristic reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum (Stertz et al., 2007; Snijder et al., 2006; Prentice et al., 2004; Knoops et al., 2008) . The first two open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) of the viral genome overlap and encode two replicase precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These long polyproteins ($4000 and $7000 amino acids, respectively) are the substrates for the autocatalytic production of 15-16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsps), which is driven by viral proteases: a 3C-like main protease (M pro ; nsp5) and one or two (depending on the virus) accessory papain-like proteases (PL1 pro and PL2 pro in nsp3; Weiss & Navas-Martin, 2005; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . The largest cleavage product derived from pp1a/pp1ab is nsp3. This subunit includes diverse enzymatic and poorly characterized domains that are involved in the replication and expression of the virus genome and virus-host interactions Snijder et al., 2003; Neuman et al., 2008; Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "One of the ubiquitous domains present in nsp3 of all coronaviruses is the X domain [also known as the adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1 00 -phosphatase (ADRP) domain], which was originally identified as a domain that is conserved in vertebrate RNA viruses of the alphavirus-like supergroup and coronaviruses (Koonin et al., 1992; Gorbalenya et al., 1991) . Its proposed enzymatic activity was based on its distant similarity to a cellular enzyme , the activity of which was first identified in yeast proteins (Shull et al., 2005; Martzen et al., 1999; Kumaran et al., 2005) and subsquently in the Archeoglobus fulgidus protein AF1521 (Karras et al., 2005) . ADRP activity has also been shown for the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), human coronavirus HCoV-229E and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) X domains (Putics et al., 2005 . The RNA viral X domains and their cellular homologues, which can be found in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea, belong to a large structural family prototyped by a macro domain (Pehrson & Fuji, 1998) . The human macroH2A1 macro domain has been shown to bind O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and both the yeast protein and the A. fulgidus protein AF1521 can bind ADP-ribose (Karras et al., 2005; Kumaran et al., 2005) . It is believed that this activity or the binding of related ligands [for example poly(ADP)-ribose] might determine the function of the macro domain. The X domains of several coronaviruses [SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain M41; Egloff et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2009] and alphaviruses (Malet et al., 2009) have also been shown to bind ADP-ribose. Catalytic phosphatase activity and ADP-ribose binding are two related but distinct properties of the X domain. Despite considerable progress in the in vitro characterization of coronaviral X domains, their activity and function in vivo, which are apparently linked to virus pathogenesis, remain poorly understood (Eriksson et al., 2008) .",

Subgroup 1a includes feline coronavirus (FCoV) and TGEV. HCoV-229E belongs to subgroup 1b, together with HCoV-NL63 and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV). Subgroup 2a contains the murine hepatitis virus MHV and the porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus BCoV. In 2003 the new SARS-CoV was classified as member of a new subgroup 2b. Group 3 originally included only avian viruses such as IBV. Very recently, a number of new coronaviruses have been identified that could be prototypes of separate subgroups in groups 2 and 3 (Woo et al., 2009; Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008) .",

Here, we report the first crystal structure of the X domain from feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which belongs to coronaviral subgroup 1a. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a pathogenic FCoV variant that emerged by mutation of the relatively benign enteric FCoV (Vennema et al., 1998; Poland et al., 1996) and causes a fatal immune-mediated disease in cats (Pedersen, 1995) . Since the variations are minor and despite the fact that we are working with a FIPV construct, we will henceforth use FCoV as an abbreviation for the virus. The FCoV X-domain structure was determined in tetragonal and cubic space groups to 3.1 and 2.2 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. In addition, the structure with bound ADP-ribose was determined in the cubic crystal form to 3.9 \u00c5 resolution. We analyzed the similarity of the FCoV X-domain structure to those of other coronaviral X domains and macro domains from other organisms.",

Three molecules were found in the asymmetric unit cell of the tetragonal crystal form and eight in that of the cubic crystal form. Orthorhombic crystals were obtained in buffer containing sodium formate and sodium acetate. Interestingly, soaking cubic crystals with heavy-atom solutions led to a change of the space group to the orthorhombic form. The implied similarity between the packing in the two crystal forms would suggest the presence of 24 molecules in the asymmetric unit of the orthorhombic crystal form. The tendency of the FCoV X domain to oligomerize is striking, taking into consideration the fact that no buffer molecules were interpretable in the electron density of either the tetragonal or cubic space groups. Interestingly, PISA-mediated analysis of X-domain interfaces in both the tetragonal and cubic space groups revealed no specific interactions that could result in the formation of stable quaternary structures, which is in agreement with the observation that the X domain is monomeric in dilute solution. Analytical sizeexclusion chromatography demonstrated that under the experimental conditions used the protein eluted as a monomer (results not shown). However, solutions of the protein do yield a heavy precipitate overnight. The observed tendency to form multimers might be biologically relevant since the X domain is one of many domains of nsp3, which is likely to be part of a large replication/transcription complex. Indeed, interactions between several nonstructural proteins have been identified and are of importance in the structure and function of the viral enzyme complexes that have been analyzed (Imbert et al., 2008; von Brunn et al., 2007) . The crystal structure of the IBV X domain contains a crystallographic dimer with a relatively large interface area of 2600 \u00c5 2 (Xu et al., 2009) . In contrast, the interface between FCoV X-domain monomers is small but well defined, with some interactions occurring in both crystals forms. The interactions result in rigid lattices with large solvent channels, which might make the crystals capable of acting of a host lattice for other biological molecules. The packing is described in more detail in the supplementary material.",

The alignment is based on the PDB structures of the FCoV X domain (PDB code 3eti; UniProtKB reference Q98VG9), the HCoV-229E X domain (3ejg; UniProtKB reference P0C6X1), the SARS-CoV X domain (2fav; UniProtKB reference P0C6U8), the IBV X domain (3ewo; UniProtKB reference P0C6V5), A. fulgidus AF1521 protein (1hjz; UniProtKB reference O28751), E. coli ER58 protein (1spv; UniProtKB reference P0A8D6) and human macroH2.2A domain (1zr3; UniProtKB reference O75367).

Two phosphate groups are hydrogen bonded to the main-chain N atoms of the region 158-SVGIF-162. During the refinement process for the tetragonal crystal form, additional electron density (wF o \u00c0 DF c synthesis) was found in the binding cleft of molecules A, B and C. Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), which is a very abundant metabolite in bacterial cells, could be fitted to this density (Fig. 4) . A comparison with the ADP-ribose-bound molecule B revealed that the phosphate of G3P is in the same position as the -phosphate of ADP-ribose. Similarly to the ADPribose-bound structure, the region 158-SVGIF-162 forms hydrogen bonds between its backbone amide groups and the O atoms of the G3P phosphate.

(2006) showed that the X domain undergoes conformational changes upon binding to ADP-ribose, leading to the formation of a 'bridge' over the binding cleft. This 'bridge' is formed by close contacts between Ile132 and Gly48 (SARS-CoV numbering). Gly48 is part of a largely conserved 'triple-glycine' sequence 47-GGG-49 (FCoV numbering). In the X domains of HCoV-229E and IBV strain M41, in which all three positions are occupied by glycine residues, the 'bridge' between Ile126-Gly44 (HCoV-229E numbering) and Ile133-Gly49 (IBV strain M41 numbering) is formed upon ADP-ribose binding (Xu et al., 2009) . However, in the case of IBV strain Beaudette the second glycine is substituted by serine (46-GSG-48). This leads to large structural changes in the region 128-SCGIF-132 (IBV strain Beaudette numbering), which might explain why this X domain does not bind ADP-ribose (Piotrowski et al., 2009) . In the FCoV X domain the first glycine is replaced by valine (75-VGG-77). In the ligand-free cubic crystal form the shortest interatomic distance between residues Ile161 and Gly76 is greater than 6.0 \u00c5 (with one exception). In the tetragonal crystal form with G3P bound the shortest interatomic distance between residues Ile161 and Gly76 is 4.5 \u00c5 (in molecules A and C) or 5.7 \u00c5 (molecule B). However, in ADPribose-bound molecules B, C and D the shortest distance between those two residues is smaller than 4 \u00c5 , which results in formation of the 'bridge' (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, the G3Pbound form seems to be an intermediate between closed and open conformations in which residues Ile161 and Gly76 are becoming closer to each other than in the ligand-free form but in which the 'bridge' is still not formed.",

This largely arises from the conformation of Tyr187, which lies across the binding pocket. In ADPribose-bound molecules the side chain of Tyr187 rotates by 90 and orients along the ADP-ribose binding site, significantly expanding the binding cavity (Fig. 5) . Cleft analysis using the PDBsum server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk) showed that conformational change of Tyr187 leads to the enlargement of the binding cleft by almost 600 \u00c5 3 , which creates sufficient space for the binding of ADP-ribose. In order to further examine the binding properties of the FCoV X domain, an ADP-ribose-binding assay was performed in vitro (see x2). The retention of the ligand on immobilized Surface of the FCoV X domain in the ligand-free conformation (a) and with ADP-ribose bound (b). Residues Ile161 and Tyr187, which undergo significant conformational changes during ADP-ribose binding, are labelled in blue. ADP-ribose is shown as red sticks.",

Two highly divergent macro-domain folds have recently been identified in the nsp3 'SARS-unique domain' (SUD; Tan et al., 2009 ) that was shown to bind single-stranded poly(A) (Chatterjee et al., 2009 ) and oligo(G) strings (Tan et al., 2007) . Several macro domains, including coronaviral X domains, have been shown to bind ADP-ribose and related ligands. It has also been suggested that the function of viral X domains may be the ability to bind poly(ADP)-ribose, by which they interact with host-cell pathways (Egloff et al., 2006) . Catalytic adenosine diphosphateribose-1 00 -phosphatase activity has been shown for a number of macro domains, including the X domain of another member of coronavirus subgroup 1a, TGEV. The ADRP reaction turnover was found to be very low in vitro and this led to uncertainty as to the physiological relevance of this enzymatic activity (Egloff et al., 2006) . On the other hand, this activity has been implicated in the rate control of a yet-to-be-identified RNA-processing pathway in infected cells . In addition, it has been reported that MHV liver pathology is affected in an engineered virus mutant carrying an X domain with a mutation in the putative active site (Eriksson et al., 2008) . Despite the available information, the function of the coronaviral X domain and its importance in the viral life cycle have not been fully elucidated and further functional studies are therefore required in order to understand its role in detail.",
