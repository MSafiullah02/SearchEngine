            "text": "ECMO is increasingly being used for patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), particularly in cases of severe ARDS in which life-threatening hypoxemia or hypercapnia persists despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilatory support [ 1 , 2 ] . In addition, ECMO is used in some patients in whom lifethreatening gas exchange abnormalities are suffi ciently improved with the use of positive-pressure ventilation, but only at the expense of generating excessively high inspiratory airway pressures. ECMO in this setting facilitates lung-protective ventilation and minimizes ventilator-associated lung injury. Despite the increasing use of ECMO in ARDS, high-level evidence supporting its benefi t for this indication is lacking. The fi rst successful use of ECMO for severe post-traumatic hypoxemic respiratory failure was in 1971 by Dr. J.D. Hill and colleagues. The patient received venoarterial extracorporeal support with a Bramson membrane lung for 75 h and survived [ 3 ] . This success prompted others to attempt the institution of ECMO support for severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, with reports of approximately 150 cases performed from the original Hill report through 1974, though mortality was 85-90 % [ 4 -6 ] . In 1979, Warren Zapol and colleagues published the results of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of mechanical ventilation supplemented with venoarterial ECMO versus conventional mechanical ventilation alone, according to the standard of care at that time, as a therapy for severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [ 7 ] . Ninety subjects were randomized to conventional mechanical ventilation alone or mechanical ventilation and ECMO, with slow and fast entry criteria utilized for enrollment based on a combination of severity and duration of hypoxemia, resulting in a maximum PaO 2 to FiO 2 ratio of 83. Subjects with prolonged mechanical ventilation (greater than 21 days), evidence of left atrial hypertension (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than 25) , and chronic or irreversible diseases were excluded. The trial demonstrated no signifi cant difference in survival (9.5 % in the ECMO group, 8.3 % in the control group, Table 2 .1 ), with high rates of infectious and bleeding complications. The low rate of survival in the control group also highlights the high severity of illness in the study population and the different standard of care for mechanical ventilation in ARDS at that time.",

The concept involved using venovenous extracorporeal support at low blood fl ow rates principally to remove CO 2 , a technique known as extracorporeal CO 2 removal or ECCO 2 R. By removing CO 2 directly from the blood, they could ventilate the subjects at lower airway pressures and respiratory rates-what they termed \"low-frequency positive-pressure ventilation\" (LFPPV) while providing passive oxygenation through the endotracheal tube [ 8 -11 ] . The goal was to provide what Gattinoni referred to as \"pulmonary rest,\" the precursor to low-volume, low-pressure ventilation strategies [ 11 ] . Results of a prospective, uncontrolled study of 43 subjects treated with a LFPPV-ECCO 2 R strategy for severe respiratory failure (average PaO 2 to FIO 2 ratio of 67) demonstrated a survival of 49 %, despite an anticipated survival of less than 10 % based on similar inclusion and exclusion criteria to those used in the trial by Zapol [ 9 ] .",

Forty subjects were randomized between 1987 and 1991 to receive either conventional mechanical ventilation or a strategy of pressure-control inverse ratio ventilation (PCIRV), followed by LFPPV-ECCO 2 R if PCIRV was unable to maintain adequate PaO 2 or pH. Entry criteria were similar to those used by Zapol and Gattinoni. Oxygenation was markedly impaired, with an average PaO 2 to FIO 2 ratio of 63. The results demonstrated no difference in mortality between groups, with a survival of 42 % in the control group and 33 % in the PCIRV plus LFPPV-ECCO 2 R group. Hemorrhage with high rates of transfusion led to ECCO 2 R discontinuation in seven (37 %) of the subjects in the experimental group, and four subjects (21 %) developed clot within the extracorporeal circuit. Although the authors concluded there was no role for ECCO 2 R as a therapy for ARDS, there were several notable limitations of this trial. The intervention group received two different experimental treatment modalities (inverse ratio ventilation and ECCO 2 R), worldwide experience with extracorporeal techniques was limited prior to study initiation, and the intervention arm was exposed to notably high airway pressures despite extracorporeal support. Additionally, survival among those in the control group was higher than in the previous studies, highlighting the differences in patient characteristics, therapeutic interventions, or protocols for respiratory care between this study and previously published data. Furthermore, while all of these studies used uniform entry criteria that facilitate comparisons between trials, these criteria may not refl ect best practice for the initiation of extracorporeal support.",

Among the 47 subjects admitted to the ICU with a confi rmed diagnosis of infl uenza, 30 (64 %) met criteria for ARDS, with a median PaO 2 to FIO 2 ratio of 61 and median PEEP of 22. Multisystem organ failure was common (87 %). None of the subjects with ARDS received so-called \"rescue therapies\" such as inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, inhaled epoprostenol, or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, although neuromuscular blocking agents were used in 47 % of subjects. Despite a high severity An attempt to reconcile this issue was made by Noah and colleagues from the United Kingdom, who compared ECMO-referred subjects with confi rmed or strongly suspected H1N1-related ARDS ( n = 80) to non-ECMO-referred subjects with H1N1-related ARDS who were enrolled in a separate, concurrent prospective cohort study within the same geographical area and who were potentially eligible for ECMO ( n = 195) [ 27 ] . Only 69 of the 80 subjects referred for ECMO received ECMO (86 %). However, statistical analysis was performed by intention-to-treat principles. Individual, propensity score, and GenMatch matching were used to match subjects from each group on the basis of demographic, physiologic, and comorbidity data that were anticipated a priori to be associated with ECMO use and hospital mortality (prior duration of mechanical ventilation, PaO 2 to FIO 2 ratio, age, SOFA score, body mass index (BMI), pregnancy status, and use of alternative ventilation strategies). After matching for the above variables, the ECMO-referred subjects consistently had a mortality approximately half that of the non-ECMO-referred subjects (24 % vs. 47 % by propensity score matching, RR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.31-0.84, p = 0.008). The investigators could not account for differences in ventilatory strategies between groups, nor could they assess the impact of variables not captured in the database of the cohort of non-ECMO-referred subjects, which may have confounded the results of this non-randomized comparison.",

However, there are inherent fl aws in comparing non-randomized studies. Changes in clinical management confound the comparison of survival rates from different eras. This is evident in the decline in mortality rates observed in ARDS over the last decade [ 28 ] , with mortality of 31 % in the intervention arm of ARMA in 2000 [ 29 ] , 25 % in the fl uid-conservative strategy arm in FACTT in 2006, and 16-18 % in the control arms of ALTA and OMEGA in 2011 [ 30 -32 ] . Likewise, ECMO technology has evolved signifi cantly since the early randomized trials, with more effi cient membranes for gas exchange, the advent of centrifugal pumps, heparin-coated circuits that can tolerate lower levels of anticoagulation resulting in lower bleeding risk, and cannulae that permit single-vessel access with minimal recirculation. Comparisons of non-randomized ECMO studies are also confounded by indication, which is infl uenced by multiple factors, including but not limited to patient age, disease severity, concomitant medical conditions, concurrent therapies, and physicians' estimation of prognosis.",

In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, 180 subjects, age 18-65, with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure and a Lung Injury Score (a.k.a. Murray Score, a composite score based on PaO 2 to FIO 2 ratio, PEEP, respiratory system compliance, and radiographic fi ndings [ 34 ] ) of \u22653.0 or uncompensated hypercapnia (pH < 7.2) despite \"optimal conventional management\" were randomly assigned to receive ongoing conventional mechanical ventilation at designated treatment centers or be transferred to a single ECMO center at Glenfi eld Hospital in Leicester for consideration of treatment with venovenous ECMO. Subjects were excluded from the trial if they had contraindications to anticoagulation or if they had been on high pressure (peak inspiratory airway pressure >30 cm H 2 O) or high FIO 2 (>0.8) for greater than 7 days. Hemodynamically stable subjects randomized to the ECMO referral arm were initially managed on transfer to Glenfi eld with a standardized management protocol that included a pressure-restricted ventilation strategy, diuresis to dry weight, transfusion to a hematocrit of 40 %, prone positioning and full nutrition. Those who were hemodynamically unstable or failed to respond to this strategy within 12 h were placed on ECMO. Only 76 % of the subjects referred for ECMO actually received ECMO, however all subjects who received ECMO were managed with a lungprotective ventilation strategy. In total, 93 % of subjects in the ECMO referral arm received treatment with a low-volume, low-pressure strategy at some point in their care. By comparison, because there was no mandate of a lung-protective ventilation strategy in the conventional management group (a low-volume, low-pressure strategy was advised) and perhaps because many of these subjects were diffi cult to ventilate, only 70 % of those subjects were managed with such a strategy at any time during the study. Subjects were well-matched between groups and the majority were randomized early in ARDS, with 62 % of ECMO subjects and 66 % of conventionally managed subjects having been on high pressure or high FIO 2 for 48 h or less, with an average of 28 h in each group. Average PaO 2 to FIO 2 was approximately 75 in both groups. The primary outcome-death or severe disability by 6 months after randomization-occurred in 37 % of the subjects referred for ECMO, as compared with 53 % of those in the conventional management group, relative risk 0.69 (95 % confi dence interval 0.05-0.97, p = 0.03).",

While these criteria take into account the risks of prolonged hypoxemia and oxygen toxicity, there is no consideration of hypercapnia with resulting acidemia or plateau airway pressures as factors that may infl uence the decision to initiate ECMO. Furthermore, the specifi c time and oxygenation cutoffs used for entry criteria have not been independently validated or shown to correlate with mortality. Among the best data available to estimate the prognosis of patients with ARDS without ECMO support comes from the work of the ARDS Defi nition Task Force [ 1 ] , which redefi ned ARDS based on the degree of hypoxemia as a predictor of mortality. Lower PaO 2 to FIO 2 ratio cutoffs correlate with increased mortality (45 % when PaO 2 to FIO 2 is less than 100, vs. 27-32 % in mild to moderate ARDS) and longer duration of mechanical ventilation (9 days in severe ARDS vs. 5-7 days in mild to moderate ARDS). Based on these data, patients with lower ratios of PaO 2 to FIO 2 would seem to benefi t the most from aggressive interventions. However, the appropriate cut off for initiating ECMO has yet to be determined. Given the consensus decision by the ARDSnet trial investigators to set a goal PaO 2 of 55-80 mmHg [ 29 ] , ultimately representing a range of values within which the amount of PEEP or FIO 2 is not deescalated because the patient is presumed to be near the steep portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, one may consider a PaO 2 to FIO 2 ratio of 80 as a reasonable cutoff for consideration of ECMO (Table 2. 3 ) [ 2 ] . This threshold is similar to the PaO 2 to FIO 2 ratio that was used as part of the slow entry criteria in the early ECMO trials [ 7 , 12 ] , and at the upper limit of many observational studies [ 15 -22 , 24 , 25 ] . The PaO 2 to FIO 2 ratio is one component of the Lung Injury Score which uses a combination of physiologic and radiographic characteristics to quantify the extent of lung injury in ARDS [ 34 ] . However, because of its non-physiologic component and a lack of data to support its ability to predict survival among patients with the most severe forms of ARDS, it may be less useful as a criterion for initiation of ECMO.",

            "text": "There are few absolute contraindications for ECMO in severe ARDS. Any condition that precludes the use of anticoagulation is typically considered an absolute contraindication because of the need for systemic anticoagulant therapy to maintain the integrity of the circuit. However, in patients with severe bleeding, anticoagulation may be withheld for signifi cant periods of time with apparent safety [ 42 ] . Given the advances in technology, the inability to anticoagulate should perhaps be considered only a relative contraindication to receiving ECMO. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is another disorder that may be problematic because of the high risk of thrombosis (within the patient or the circuit) if platelet transfusion is needed in the setting of life-threatening hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia. While this may not be an absolute contraindication, the likelihood of survival without ECMO would have to be suffi ciently low to consider accepting such a high risk.",

            "text": "The theoretical benefi t of ECMO for severe cases of ARDS largely relates to lung protection: a decreased need for high-pressure ventilation or toxic fractions of inspired oxygen. Yet, this potential for benefi t may be limited if the patient has already been exposed to high airway pressures and inspired oxygen levels such that damage is irreversible. Many clinicians think that patients who have been receiving high-pressure ventilation with plateau pressure exceeding 30 cm H 2 O for greater than 7 days are less likely to benefi t from ECMO [ 43 -45 ] . Similarly, prolonged exposure to high fractions of inspired oxygen, which may induce lung infl ammation, could nullify any benefi cial effect of ECMO support, though this remains an area of controversy [ 46 , 47 ] . Earlier initiation of ECMO, perhaps for these or other reasons, has been associated with better outcomes in some, but not all, observational studies [ 18 , 45 , 48 , 49 ] . Other relative contraindications include limitations in vascular access that would preclude cannula placement and any conditions in which ECMO would be unlikely to alter the patient's overall prognosis, including but not limited to advanced malignancy or severe and irreversible brain injury. Finally, ECMO, when considered as a bridge to lung transplantation, should only be offered if the patient is actually a candidate for transplantation.",
