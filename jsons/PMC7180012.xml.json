More than 50% of people in Yemen do not have access to safe water and over 2 million children and pregnant women have acute malnutrition.4 Given the humanitarian situation and the conflict within the country that has been ongoing since 2015, we fear the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Yemen could be disastrous. The situation warrants immediate attention. Here, we summarise the current preparedness and response to COVID-19 in Yemen in terms of detection, prevention, and response in light of the recent government decisions to establish a national COVID-19 taskforce and response plan.",

The surveillance system covers around 37% of the health facilities in Yemen. Evidence from previous outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria shows the capability of the national health system to establish and maintain an event-based surveillance if needed.5 However, some flaws still exist, such as the shortage of technical staff required for field investigation or active surveillance. Moreover, no national workforce strategy exists to employ epidemiologists. The national laboratory system is rudimentary and relies on a few central laboratories\u2014ie, the National Central Public Health Laboratory in Sana'a and its four branches in Aden, Taiz, Hadramout, and Hodeidah governorates. The weaknesses in the laboratory system are not limited to the number of national laboratories, but also are due to the shortage of PCR machines and reagents to detect cases of COVID-19.",

Since the spread of COVID-19, Yemen's Government has not been able to prepare enough locations for isolation at points of entry into the country nor has it been able to fulfil International Health Regulations standards in response to pandemics. Most of Yemen's points of entry have little or no technical capacity or established system to deal effectively with travellers with suspected infection. Furthermore, Yemen has long costal boarders, which regularly receive thousands of migrants and refugees from the Horn of Africa. How the country can apply public health measures in response to migrants' movement across its permeable borders and seaports is as yet unclear.",

Nationally, the identification of public health risks and prioritisation of resources are still uncertain.

Fear is increasing among health-care staff due to the lack of personal protective equipment and the massive shortage of equipment and medicines.",
