Non-homogeneities in the basic parameters are easily included by integration for arbitrary distributions of incubation and removal times, recovering the classical SEIR model under the assumption of exponential distributions. We compare the solution to these equations, uSEIR, to two types of agent-based model simulations, a spatially homogeneous one where infection occurs by proximity, and a model on a scale-free network with varying clustering properties, where the infection between any two agents occurs via their link if it exists. We find good agreement in both cases with the uSEIR solution. Furthermore a family of asymptotic solutions of the uSEIR equations is found in terms of a logistic curve, which after a non-universal time shift, fits extremely well all the microdynamical simulations. A link to software packages for the numerical solution of the uSEIR equations is provided.",

We study two sources of this non-uniformity: inhomegeneity in the probability of infection per contact and inhomogeneity in the number of contacts per individual. The first is modelled with an ABM model with a negative binomial distribution of the probability of infection per contact, the second is modelled with a simulation on a scale-free network. The uSEIR equations represent instead the evolution in which the infection rate per unit time is the average one, independently of the underlying distribution. We observe that the simulations show a significant variance which however amounts mostly to a time-translation. When the different curves of infected individuals are shifted to tune their maxima, all the curves fall on a universal curve correctly reproduced by the uSEIR equations. We analyse the origin of this universality, i.e., independence on initial conditions. It derives from an asymptotic solution of the uSEIR equations, which is found to be a logistic curve whose shape is fixed by the average microscopic parameters. In the case of networks we briefly comment on the effect of clustering on the dynamics of the epidemic.",

In order to understand the underlying dynamics, it is useful to think of an epidemic outbreak in terms of simple agent-based models (ABMs) [8] , where the microdynamics can be studied by computer simulations. In these models agents can make their own decisions based on the rules given to them, and the evolution can capture unexpected aggregate phenomena that result from combined individual behaviours. ABMs can incorporate easily stochastic parameters as well as heterogeneities in the population, and they are therefore a useful tool to study the performance of the description in terms of global variables.",

Only infectious agents can induce the change of state of another susceptible agent to that of exposed with a given infection rate, r S\u2192E . Each exposed agent necessarily becomes infectious after an incubation time, t i , while each infectious agent remains in this state only during the recovery/removal time interval, t r . In a real epidemic this time would be the interval of time during which an individual remains infectious. The agent can move to the removed compartment either because it dies, recovers or gets isolated. All these outcomes are equivalent as regards the evolution of the epidemic, which is monitored by the total fraction of agents in states S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) at any given time. The study of an epidemic in terms of these variables is the SEIR paradigm [9] . In this context, the so-called basic reproduction number, R 0 , is a fundamental quantity that controls the rate of infection in an homogeneous susceptible population. It is defined as the average number of individuals that a given infectious agent turn to exposed in the interval t r , assuming a fully homogeneous and susceptible population.",

In this setup 6 , each click of time represents therefore a contact and all nodes have the same number of contacts per unit time c = 1. As in the turtle world, the infectious agent remains so in a time interval t r , while the times t r , t i can be chosen different for each node by drawing samples of some previously chosen distribution.",

The agreement as expected is good, even if the variance is much larger than in the fixed-parameters case. In fact, an interesting observation is that most of the observed variance of the outbreaks is a simple time translation. If we time-translate all the outbreaks to make their maxima coincide the variance is much smaller and the agreement with SEIR better, see Fig. 5 . We will discuss the origin of this time-shift in the following section. An exponential distribution for the incubation and removal times is however not realistic. A more realistic distribution seems to be, e.g., a general gamma distribution, \u0393[k, \u03b8]. For the COVID-19 epidemic, the distribution of incubation times has been shown to be well described with a gamma with parameters (k, \u03b8) (5.8, 0.948) [6] , corresponding to an average t i 5.5 days.

However, this result seems in conflict with the fact non-uniformity in the rate is known to be very important in the evolution of an epidemic 8 . One example of this is the relevance of the fraction of individuals for which the probability of infection is zero, which in practice makes them immune. Their presence in a given population implies that the effective number of useful contacts gets reduced. The fraction of the population with zero infecting power is equivalent to the immune fraction. When this fraction is large enough the epidemic may be aborted. This is the concept of herd immunity, used to measure the needed number of vaccinations to abort an epidemic.

One would then naively expect that in an epidemic where this estimate holds about 70% of the population ends up getting infected; however, in the previous examples a larger fraction is found. This is because, due to the time delay in the process, the fraction of recovered individuals grows slowly and is not effective in reducing the growth of the epidemic sufficiently, as would be the case if the fraction of immune individuals had been present from the start, as would be the case, for instance, in a (partially) vaccinated population. Note that in the SEIR paradigm, the immune population is part of the susceptible, that pass by the compartments E \u2192 I \u2192 R but have zero infecting power when they are I so they are inert. In practice the evolution of the epidemic would be identical if we just dropped them from the start and readjust the rate not to include them.

Instead I 0 /N decreases with clustering, even for small clustering.

We have also considered ABM simulations on scale-free networks with varying clustering properties. In all cases, the model reproduced the simulations accurately after a non-universal time-shift. Only in the presence of large local clustering in the distribution of contacts we observed a clear deviation, when the averages of microdynamical parameters are included. The uSEIR formulation allowed us to understand the universality property observed in different outbreaks in the simulations. This derives from an explicit asymptotic solution found for small incubation and removal times in terms of a logistic curve, with a shape that can be determined in terms of the microdynamical parameters. This curve is found to fit very well the data even in cases of large clustering, provided the parameters are left as free fit parameters, suggesting that the dynamics in the high clustering regime may still be well described in terms of global variables but with screened or renormalized parameters. On the contrary, the early stages of an outbreak are highly non universal, an aspect that should be carefully taken into account when fitting data and predicting using any SEIR modelling. Only when the early stages of exponential growth are well underway, is uSEIR expected to be a good description. The averaging of independent outbreaks, without taking into account the non-universal time-shift, can also be very misleading.",

We define t max i = n max i and t max r = n max r as the incubation and removal times, such that for t i,r > t max i,r the distribution probabilities are negligible. These integers fix the number of additional variables we need to evolve at each time step: E 1 , ..., E n max i and I 1 , ..., I n max r . The variables E k (t) and I k (t) measure the number of exposed of infected individuals at time t that will change compartment (E \u2192 I or I \u2192 R) at time t + k.",
