In addition, the snowballing technique (identifying relevant references from the reference list of other publications) and expert consultation were utilized. Only English language research articles in peer-reviewed journals, national organization publications, and book chapters that discuss methods of and provide empirical evidence related to airborne isolation and/or establishing negative air pressure for rooms/areas were utilized. Editorials, articles published in nonpeer reviewed journals or those that address negative pressure unrelated to room air balance, and non-English language articles were excluded. Abstracts and titles were screened, and only those that met the aforementioned criteria were considered. From a total of 86 titles and abstracts, only 13 met the criteria. Searching the reference lists of these and consulting environmental health experts resulted in an additional 11 relevant publications, for a total of 24 articles.",
