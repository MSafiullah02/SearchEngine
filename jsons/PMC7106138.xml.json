In brief, first, a standard RT-PCR was performed using a T7 promoter sequence incorporated forward primer. PCR product containing T7 promoter was subjected to IVT at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. The IVT products were then treated with 1 U of DNase I and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes to remove the remaining DNA. The DNase I activity was stopped by adding 1 \u03bcL of 0.5 mol/L EDTA and heat deactivated further at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The excess nucleotides and pyrophosphate were removed by NH4OAc/ethanol precipitation. The RNA pellet was suspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The amount of IVT-generated RNA fragments was determined using the NanoDrop ND2000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE) and converted to molecular copies by using the following formula:(1)Ymolecules/\u03bcL=Xg/\u03bcLRNA\u00d76.02\u00d71023/transcriptlength(base)\u00d7340\n",

Samples were assayed with 250 nmol/L of each primer in a 1\u00d7 final concentration of SYBR Green ready mastermix.

            "text": "In addition, serotyping information is important for the understanding of dengue epidemiology. For instance, serotype switch is used as an early warning of epidemics in Singapore because data have revealed that such switches are associated with epidemics. In recent studies, several DENV serotyping assays have been reported to require four tubes of tests14 or to be unable to detect CHIKV at the same time.15, 26 Recently, a few probe-based multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays were published for simultaneous detection of CHIKV and DENV, which required individual primer and probe sets to detect each targeted virus, but none of them can be used for DENV serotyping,27, 28, 29 probably because of the limitation in the number of channels required for discriminating the viruses using real-time PCR instruments. For instance, Cecilia et al29 reported a single-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection and quantification of all dengue serotypes and CHIKV. The assay was developed using primers and TaqMan probes targeting DENV-1/2/3, DENV-4, CHIKV, and \u03b2-actin. The assay revealed high sensitivity for DENV (100%) and CHIKV (95.8%) with high specificity (100%) when compared with conventional RT-PCR assay. Detection limit was set within the range of 1 to 50 PFU/mL (100 PFU/mL for DENV-2 and 3, 1000 PFU/mL for DENV-1 and CHIKV, and 3250 PFU/mL for DENV-4). The assay is used primarily for detection of all four DENV serotypes and CHIKV but lacks serotyping capability. We report a rapid and accurate laboratory confirmation method to simultaneously detect, quantify, and differentiate DENV and CHIKV infection with DENV serotyping capability by a SYBR Green I\u2013based one-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay.",

However, the primary disadvantage of the SYBR Green I dye chemistry is that it binds to any double-stranded DNA, including nonspecific PCR products and primer dimers, which may lead to false-positive results. To counter the problem, primer sets used in this study were carefully designed and examined based on heterodimer formation likelihood and thermal compatibility. In brief, DENV serotyping primers were designed based on genome alignment of multiple strains of all four serotypes of DENV. The primer-binding sites selected were well conserved across all four DENV serotypes, whereas the nucleotide sequences in between, flanked by the forward and reverse primers, were less conserved to yield different Tm of the PCR amplicons. DEst1 (the targeting PrM region of the DENV genome) was selected among 20 pairs of DENV serotyping primers because of its outstanding performance in primer verification. For CHIKV, primers were designed to preferably target nonstructural protein-coding regions because they were usually well conserved. CHK1 (the targeting nsP3 region of the CHIKV genome) was selected based on its exceptionally good compatibility with DEst1, reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity in primer verification. In addition, a temperature range, instead of a fixed value, for PCR amplicons is given for each virus so that fluctuations of the Tm from the respective PCR amplicons (ie, sample variance, strain variations) could be tolerated.",

To overcome this issue, external positive controls (ie, standard viral RNA) were included in every RT-PCR run throughout this study.",
