Both genera are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses of positive polarity with genomes ranging from 10 to 12 kilobases in length [2,3]. Some members of these genera, including the Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, are efficiently transmitted by the same vector, mosquitoes of the Aedes genus [4,5]. Furthermore, in recent years, several members of these viral genera have emerged as important human pathogens that have caused severe epidemic outbreaks at a regional or global level [6].",

Typically, these arthritogenic viral infections are associated with symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, rash, joint pain and in some cases, limiting and long-lasting polyarthralgia [9,10]. Recently, severe clinical manifestations, including fatal outcomes, have been observed in patients infected with CHIKV, suggesting that some Alphavirus infections have the potential to produce serious disease [11,12].",

Before its introduction in Brazil in 2015, ZIKV was thought to only cause mild infection [14]. However, following the outbreak in Brazil, ZIKV infection was correlated with serious neurological disorders, including microcephaly in newborns and the appearance of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults [15]. Despite the large impact of these arbovirus infections on the health systems of affected countries and the frequent emergence of new viral pathogens, there are currently no approved treatments or vaccines to combat these infections. As a result, there is an urgent need to identify new broad-acting antiviral drugs.",

Ginkgolic acid is a natural compound isolated from the seed coats or leaves of Ginkgo biloba, a plant that is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine [17]. Earlier reports have shown that Ginkgolic acid has antitumoral [18,19], antibacterial [20] and antiparasitic activity [21], as well as antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [22]. Moreover, this compound is able to inhibit SUMOylation, a post-translational protein modification that regulates key processes in the cell [23]. Nonetheless, Ginkgolic acid\u2019s ability to disrupt arbovirus replication remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of Ginkgolic acid against the arboviruses CHIKV, MAYV, UNAV, and ZIKV.",

To do this, Vero cells were pre-treated with Ginkgolic acid or DMSO as described earlier and infected at different times with ZIKV; then viral progeny production was measured by plaque-forming assay. In DMSO-treated cells, we observed a clear time-dependent increase in viral titers (Figure 6A). In contrast, in the Ginkgolic acid-treated cells, there was an appreciable reduction in viral progeny production in both tested times and this effect was dose-dependent (Figure 6A,B). To verify whether the virucidal activity of Ginkgolic acid observed with CHIKV, MAYV or UNAV also occurred with ZIKV, we incubated 105 PFU of the virus in serum-free medium that contained the drug or DMSO as a control. These experiments revealed again that Ginkgolic acid had a potent inhibitory effect on the virus\u2019 infectivity capacity (Figure 6C). Finally, we performed a time addition experiment as previously described to evaluate in which stage of the ZIKV life cycle the treatment was affecting. As shown in Figure 6D, we found that Ginkgolic acid only affected ZIKV replication when it was administered in the first 2 hpi as we observed in the experiments with the alphaviruses.

With this in mind, we performed a time addition experiment to evaluate the impact of Ginkgolic acid on arbovirus life cycles. Our findings suggest that this compound affects the immediate early or early phase of virus replication. In connection with this, we decided to study alternative mechanisms by which Ginkgolic acid could prevent Alphavirus replication. Thus, we assessed the expression of viral proteins E1 and nsP1 using Western blot. These analyses suggest that Ginkgolic acid suppresses the expression of both viral proteins. Other studies have shown that natural compounds, such as Harringtonine can inhibit CHIKV replication through the suppression of viral protein expression.",

Some studies have revealed that Ginkgolic acid demonstrates cytotoxic activity at high concentrations in different cell lines [41,42]. Similar findings on cytotoxicity have been reported using animals [43]. However, one pharmacokinetic study showed that Ginkgolic acid can be detected at micromolar levels in rat plasma following oral administration of a small dose (10 mg/kg), suggesting that non-cytotoxic doses of this compound could be used in animal models to evaluate its possible antiviral activity [44]. With respect to this, further detailed studies are required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this compound as an antiviral drug in an animal infection model. However, to our knowledge, this is the first time that Ginkgolic acid\u2019s broader antiviral activity against different arthropod-borne viruses has been demonstrated.",
