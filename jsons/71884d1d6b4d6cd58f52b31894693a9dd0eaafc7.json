The bispectral index (BIS) allows for the rapid and standardised assessment of the cortical function based upon eletroencephalogram analysis whereas the ratio of suppression (RS) is indicative of the absence of electrical activity of the brain. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the BIS and the RS for predicting neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. Patients and methods This was a prospective, single center, observational study performed in a large regional University hospital. Adult patients admitted to the ICU for cardiac arrest between March 2012 and October 2014 were included in the study. The exclusion criteria was pregnancy. The BIS and the RS were collected as soon as possible after ICU admission. The patients were not included in the analysis if they died within 24 h, if they had a low signal quality [defined as high EMG artefacts (\u226530 dB)], or if the monitoring of BIS started 24 h after ICU admission. The neurological outcome of the patients was based upon the cerebral performans category (CPC) calculated at 3 months. CPC score of 1 or 2 indicated good outcome, whereas CPC score of 3-5 indicated poor outcome. Results During the study period 148 patients were admitted to our ICU for a cardiac arrest. The BIS and RS were monitored in 103 patients.17 patients were excluded (early death \u226424 h; low quality of signal; BIS and RS performed \u226524 h after ICU admission). Thus, 86 patients were enrolled in this study. The means age was 57.6 \u00b1 16.8 years, 61 patients (70.9%) were male, the cardiac arrest was out-of-hospital in 63 patients (73.3%), hypoxia was the main cause of cardiac arrest (43%), 60 patients (70.6%) were treated with therapeutic hypothermia. At 3 month of follow-up, a total of 50 patients (58.1%) had died and 55 patients (63.9%) were classified as having a poor outcome. The mean duration from the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) to the BIS and RS measurements was 5.7 \u00b1 3.0 h. The BIS values were significantly lower in patient with poor outcome compared with patients with a good outcome (5.9 \u00b1 11.1 vs 37.1 \u00b1 18.0, p < 0.0001). The RS values were significantly higher in patient with poor outcome group compared to those with good neurological outcome (85.9 \u00b1 26.3 vs 18.4 \u00b1 31.3, p < 0.0001). The BIS predicted poor outcome with a likelihood ratio of 23.8 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.918 [95% CI (0.839-0.966)]. The optimal sensitivity [78.4%, 95% CI (67.3-89.5)] and specificity [96.5%, 95% CI (89.8-100)] for neurological outcome prediction was obtained using a cut-off value of BIS < 5. The RS predicted poor outcome with a likehood ratio of 23.8 and an AUC of 0.936 [95% CI (0.862-0.977)]. The optimal sensitivity [78.0%, 95% CI (66.9-89.0)] and specificity [96.8%, 95% CI (90.8-100)] for neurological outcome prediction was obtained using a cut-off value of RS > 84. In multivariable logistic regression model, BIS or RS predicted poor outcome with an odds ratio of 65.0 [95% CI (6.1-689.2), p = 0.0005]. Discussion The results of this study using the EEG derived parameters BIS and RS confirm previous findings showing that they are linked to the neurological outcome of patients admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest [2] . In particular, a BIS < 5 and/or a RS > 84, measured at ICU admission, were both strongly associated with a poor neurological outcome at 3-months.",

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to quantify the risk of AKI attributable to CM in ICU patients. Materials and methods A systematic review until December 31st 2015, through 5 databases, searched for studies evaluating intravascular administration of iodinated CM. Only controlled studies evaluating AKI following CM exposure in ICU patients matched to unexposed patients were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was performed on patient-level data using a hierarchical Bayesian nested mixed effects multiple logistic regression model. Bayesian methodology allows evaluating how evidence-based physicians would assess the AKI risk attributable to CM according to both their a priori belief and the presentation of the controlled studies identified in the systematic review. Two meta-analyses were performed with different a priori hypotheses. An objective meta-analysis modeled a neutral state of a priori belief (Odds Ratio [OR] of 1 with impartial distribution) yielding a posteriori OR distribution representative of data collected in controlled studies. A subjective meta-analysis modeled the common belief that CM increases the AKI risk, using an a priori OR of 1.37 based on uncontrolled studies holding clinical community consensus. We determined the minimum a priori relative effective sample size (RESS, representing the a priori strength of belief ) needed to observe a significant a posteriori OR distribution: how much physicians have to be convinced a priori that CM increases AKI risk to maintain this belief after being confronted with the studies data. Results Among 5696 references, 10 compared ICU patients receiving CM with an unexposed group and 4 performed risk adjustments for baseline AKI risk. Three studies used patient matching: overall, 280 CM patients were matched with 280 control patients. The resulting a posteriori OR did not reach statistical significance: with no prior assumption, there is no evidence that CM increases the risk of AKI in the ICU. Using an a priori OR of 1.37 (subjective meta-analysis), the a posteriori distribution of the OR did not reach statistical significance except when modelling a very high a priori belief that CM causes AKI (minimum a priori RESS 4.8-folds higher than the RESS of the objective meta-analysis and 70-folds higher than a neutral objective a priori hypothesis). Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis did not enlighten a risk of AKI attributable to iodinated CM in ICU patients. Introduction Acute kidney injury is particularly common in septicshock patients and is associated with high mortality. The putative effect of renal replacement therapy (RRT) on the prognosis of such patients is highly debated; some advocating that outcome might improve owing to modulation of inflammation. We aimed to compare outcomes of septic-shock patients with severe acute kidney injury (stage 3 of KDIGO classification) treated with an early RRT strategy (all patients immediately received RRT) with those treated with a delayed RRT strategy (patients received late RRT or no RRT at all).",

Conclusion Despite antituberculous therapy and supportive care, severe forms of TBM are characterized by a poor outcome in more than 50% of cases.

Our data suggest that use of adjunctive steroids is associated with reduced disability and mortality, irrespective of immune status and severity of illness. We conclude that adjunctive steroids may benefit to all patients with a suspicion of TBM admitted to the ICU. Introduction Early Standard Rehabilitation (ESR), first passive and then passive/active, is recommended for critically ill patients in whom it reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), improves functional status, muscle strength and quality of life after hospital discharge. The early addition of leg bicycling on a cyclo-ergometer and of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is now part of common practice in the ICU. Whether it can preserve or improve muscle strength and further increase the beneficial effects of ESR is little known. Patients and methods Single-centre, randomised study comparing the effects of the combination of early and daily leg bicycling + EMS of the quadriceps + ESR (intervention group) versus ESR alone (usual care group) on the global muscle strength assessed by the MRC score at ICU discharge by a physiotherapist blinded to the randomization group (NCT02185989). All consecutive patients were potentially eligible if they were deemed to need more than 72 h of care in ICU. Main non-inclusion criteria were resuscitated cardiac arrest, presence of pacemaker or implantable defibrillator, acute cerebral disease requiring deep sedation for at least 72 h, known neuromuscular disease, and amputation of a lower limb. Randomization was stratified by sex, MV or not at study entry, and day of admission (Thursday/ Friday vs other days). The interventions were applied right from Day 1 (within 72 h of admission), 5 days/week. Protocoled ESR consisted of daily multistep program (from 10 passive mobilisations of each joint in comatose patients to passive/active muscle work, transfer to chair, standing and walking, depending on patient's level of wakefulness/ cooperation). In the intervention group, 30 min passive/active leg bicycling (even in bed-ridden patients) and 54 min EMS of the quadriceps were performed 5 days/week in addition to ESR, according to pre-established programs. Conclusion Although safe and resulting in lower decline in muscle thickness as observed on echography (not blinded assessment), the addition of daily leg bicycling and EMS to ESR did not result in higher global muscle strength as assessed by the MRC score (blinded assessment) at ICU discharge in a mixed and heterogeneous population of critically ill patients. Exploratory subgroup analyses are underway and perhaps will help to identify subsets of patients in whom the studied intervention might be beneficial and might deserve further investigations.",

Characteristics of the case patients were: age (median: 65, range: 47-73), 64% male, SAPS II (51, 37-64), ICU stay (12 days, 8-19) , hospital stay (29 days, 22-41). The median IES-R score was significantly higher in cases (14, vs control (6, 3-10), p < 0.01. IES-R > 22 was found in 13 (35.1%) cases patients versus 1 (2.7%) of control patients (p < 0.01). Activities of daily living without help were significantly most often performed in control versus cases for bathing (n = 37, 100% vs n = 33, 89%, p = 0.04) and continence (n = 37, 100% vs n = 33, 89% p = 0.04). Perception of the quality of life was not significantly different between cases and controls but increasing quality of life was much important in cases (n = 15, 40.6%) versus control (3, 8 .1%), p < 0.01. See Table 4 . Three themes were found in the qualitative analysis: the ICU stay seen as a traumatized period, a period without memories and support from families and friends. Their representations in the verbatims were 13 (35.1%), 13 (35.1%) and 3 (8.1%) . Conclusion This pilot study reported substantial neuropsychological and functional alterations related to the ICU stay and emphasized the need for better estimating these modifications in a multicenter study. Addressing these consequences adds to the role of intensivists for elaborating prevention programs and promoting post intensive care syndrome to non ICU practitioners to collaborate together for the best future of ICU patients.",

Currently, there doesn't exist any sector to orientate donors' families. The purpose of our study is to investigate the complicated grief donors' relatives, its associated diseases and risk factors. Patients and methods Prospective, single-center, observational study. During the first meeting with the transplantation coordination team of our hospital, it was proposed to the organ donors' relatives to participate. The relatives who had accepted received the ICG, IDS-SR and PCLS questionnaires at 1, 3 and 6 months after the death. The primary endpoint was the presence of complicated grief, defined by an ICG > 25, among the relatives of organ donors after 6 months from the death. The secondary end points were the presence of major depressive disorders (IDS-SR \u2265 15) and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) (PCLS \u2265 44) at 6 months and the analysis of complicated grief's risk factors: about the deceased person (age, sex, cause of the death, place of the death, time between the hospital's entrance and the death) and about the relative ( Discussion Even if only 36% of the relatives completed the scales at 6 months, this study shows a high risk of complicated grief among donor's relatives. But we can see that the prevalence of complicated grief in this population is closed to the prevalence find after the death of a relative in the intensive care unit. Because of the lake of responses at 6 months, we can't conclude on the risk factors. Conclusion 55.2% of donor's relatives developed a complicated grief 6 months after the death.

            "text": "Despite being a fully preventable infectious disease, tetanus is still responsible for about 500,000 death worldwide. In developed countries, the incidence is strongly associated with a lack of vaccination coverage in the elderly. In the USA or in France, people over 65 year-old have a twice to tenfold increase in annual incidence of tetanus versus younger patients [1] . Introduction To date, there is no consensus on which anesthetic protocol should be used before neonatal intubation. As a result, awake intubation, although strongly discouraged by current recommendations, is still common in neonates, especially in France. Many experts consider Propofol, a short-acting anesthetic agent, an appropriate drug for premedication before neonatal intubation. Propofol is known to decrease systemic vascular resistance leading to low arterial blood pressure, which consequently raises concerns about its hemodynamic tolerance. However in neonates, low mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) is poorly correlated with low systemic or cerebral blood flow. NIRS (Near InfraRed Spectroscopy) allows cerebral tissue oxygenation monitoring, reflecting cerebral blood flow. The aim of our study was to compare cerebral oxygenation profiles between a combination of a synthetic opioid plus a muscle-blocker and propofol, used as premedication prior to neonatal endotracheal intubation.",

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) between \"atropine-propofol\" and \"atropine-atracurium-sufentanil\" before elective or semi-urgent intubation in the neonatal intensive care unit. Randomization was stratified on weight and center. Exclusion criteria included low blood pressure defined as a MABP (in mmHG) below gestational age (in weeks). Physiological parameters, including pulse oxymetry (SpO 2 ) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO 2 ), were collected 1 min prior to induction of anesthesia, and then up to 60 min after. To investigate the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption, cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) was calculated as FTOE = (SpO 2 \u2212 rScO 2 )/SpO 2 . The analyzed parameters included changes in rScO 2 Only one studied propofol before intubation and suggested that low rScO 2 could be attributable to low SpO 2 during the procedure, but not to low MABP (Smits et al., J Pediatr, 2016). None of them compared propofol to another anesthetic protocol. Our study is thus the first to compare cerebral oxygenation between two currently acceptable regimens of anesthesia for premedication before neonatal intubation. Conclusion This observational study is expected to provide useful information about cerebral oxygenation in neonates during intubation and to disentangle the effects of the drugs from the effects of the procedure. We also expect this study will en courage Neonatologists to avoid awake intubation.",

Therefore, despite major differences in epidemiology, microbiology, and outcome, clinical guidelines for management are directly adapted from adult ICU experience. We designed a prospective multicentric cohort study to describe the clinical course of CEL/NF requiring admission to PICU. Discussion This study reports the largest prospective multicentric international cohort of pediatric skin infections needing PICU admission to date. Surgery was the first risk factor reported in our cohort, before varicella. Severe circulatory and respiratory failures on admission in a context of deep biological inflammatory syndrome required aggressive treatments during the first 3 days. Lower part of the body was more frequently involved than reported before in childhood. The diagnosis was quickly suspected and confirmed mainly by ultrasound and CT scan, with the use of MRI still very rare. More than a half of patients have been operated after classical treatments associating immunoglobulins and antitoxin-antibiotics. Infection appeared mainly monobacterial as usually described in children but gram-negative strains are emerging. Mortality was still low and sequella were rare. Conclusion Cellulitis (CEL) and Necrotizing Fasciitis (NF) are still rare in childhood, with low mortality and few sequella if aggressive treatment including surgery is emergently performed. However, it seems that epidemiology has changed during the last decade in high-income countries. Statistical analysis of this database is ongoing to identify predictors of surgical requirements and to describe more precisely bacterial strains involved. Ann. Intensive Care 2017, 7(Suppl 1):8",

Therapeutic trials with immunomodulatory treatments are already underway, using HLA-DR expression on monocytes (mHLA-DR) or lymphopenia as biomarkers of immunosuppression. Pediatric patients with Septic Shock (SS) have been much less studied. Thus, the main objective of this study was to explore post-sepsis immunoparalysis in a pediatric cohort study. Both sides of cellular immunity were assessed: innate immunity (mHLA-DR) and adaptive immunity (lymphocyte subsets). We also wanted to obtain normal values of mHLA-DR in healthy children, according to age. Conclusion For the first time, we reported that healthy children presented mHLA-DR values with no variation according to age, and similar to those seen in adults. Innate immunity was similarly altered in children with Septic Shock than in adult patients. Adaptive immunity seemed to be less impaired by the shock than in adults. Further analyses will be conducted to complete these findings as functional tests on T cells. As secondary infections considerably increase the length of stay at the hospital, this report paves the way for a multicenter therapeutic trial, in order to evaluate immunostimulatory treatment in children with Septic Shock. Conclusion We managed one of the larger neonatal study for VAP in critically ill neonates. These pneumonias remained frequent in critically ill neonate and are associated with a higher mortality and morbidity.

Inclusion criteria were immunocompromised patient with acute respiratory failure rescued by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or (ECMO) or extracorporeal CO 2 removal (ECCO2R). Results 1. A total of 225 patients (age 48.6 \u00b1 15.1 years; APACHE II 26.4 \u00b1 9.0) were included in the study (30% hematologic malignancies, 28% long-term corticosteroids or immunosuppressant use, 18% solid tumor, 16% solid organ transplant, and 9% HIV). ECLS was initiated for severe ARDS, moderate ARDS, or chronic end-stage respiratory in 190(84%), 14(6%), and 19(8%) patients, respectively. Main ARDS etiologies were bacterial pneumonia (30%), viral pneumonia (18%), and specific lung involvement (12%). Refractory hypoxemia (73%) was the main indication for ECLS with lowest pre-ECLS PaO 2 /FiO 2 at 63 (51-87) mmHg. Venovenous ECMO and ECCO2R were initiated in 199 (88%) and 15(7%) patients, respectively. Pre-ECLS tidal volume was 5.7(4.7-6.4) mL/kg, with a positive end-expiratory pressure at 10(8-13) cmH 2 O and a plateau pressure at 32(30-35) cmH 2 O. Interval between mechanical ventilation onset and cannulation was 2(1-8) days. 2. Six-month mortality of patients with hematologic malignancies, long-term corticosteroids or immunosuppressant use, solid tumor, solid organ transplant, and HIV were 76, 60, 80, 51, and 71%, respectively (log-rank test, p = 0.02). Cumulative survival at 6 months were lower for patients with hematologic malignancies versus others (log-rank test, p = 0.003) whereas those with solid organ transplant exhibited higher cumulative survival at 6 months (log-rank test, p = 0.02). 3. One hundred and three patients (46%) were successfully weaned from ECLS. In-ICU and 6-month post ICU discharge survival were 37% (n = 83/225) and 32% (n = 72/225), respectively. Compared to patients who died within 6 months after ICU admission, 6-month survivors were younger (46 vs. 49 years, p = 0.05), had more frequently a newly diagnosed immunocompromised status (39 vs. 17%, p = 0.0003), were more frequently patients with solid organ transplant (24 vs 12%, p = 0.02, had a higher pre-ECMO hemoglobin (9.4 vs 8.8 g/ dL) and platelet counts (160 vs 112 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L; p = 0.008), and exhibited lower mechanical ventilation-ECMO onset interval (1[0-5] [1.42-7 .34], p = 0.005) were independently associated with 6-month mortality. 4. Eighty-two (36%) patients had at least one ECMO-related major bleeding event (oro-nasal bleeding 10%; hemothorax 7%; cerebral bleeding 7%), which was less frequent with patients alive at 6-months. One hundred and four (46%) and 20 (9%) patients reported ventilator associated pneumonia and cannula infection, respectively, with no impact on 6-month survival. Conclusion Six-month survival of ECLS-treated severe ARDS in immunocompromised patients appears low, especially for patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumor. However, young age, solid organ transplant, newly diagnosed immunocompromised status and rapid decision to start ECLS seem associated with a better prognosis.",

We wonder whether this result may be due to the wide range of tidal volume (VT) and PEEP used across the trials included and whether a strict control of them would minimize the role of \u0394P as predictor. Therefore, we investigated \u0394P in two trials in which lung protective mechanical ventilation was applied to ARDS patients. Our working hypothesis was that \u0394P was a risk factor just like compliance (Crs) or Plateau pressure (Pplat) of the respiratory system. Patients and methods ARDS patients included in the Acurasys and Proseva trials previously reported were used. Both had near inclusion criteria (notably PaO 2 /FIO 2 < 150 mm Hg and PEEP \u2265 5 cm H 2 O) and similar lung protective mechanical ventilation (in particular VT 6 ml/ kg predicted body weight and PEEP/FIO 2 table). Both found survival benefit in the experimental group. SOFA, continuous neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) infusion, prone position, combined use of NMBA and prone position, pH, PaCO 2 , PaO 2 /FIO 2 , lactate, breathing frequency, VT, PEEP, Pplat, Crs and \u0394P were recorded at day 1 after inclusion together with gender, age and SAPSII at the time of admission and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors at day 90. Cox proportional hazard models were used with covariates significantly different between survivors and non survivors at the threshold of 0.20 and mortality at day 90 as dependent variable. Due to the obvious colinearity between \u0394P, Crs and Pplat we performed the following analyses. First we made a specific Cox model for each of them. Second, we developed three Cox models in which we used the above variables by couples (Pplat-\u0394P; Crs-\u0394P and Crs-Pplat). We made the following assumptions: if both variables in the couple lacked significance in the second model, the same information was carried by each component of the couple; if one or both variables kept significant correlation each brought significant and distinct information; if significant correlation was kept for one of the variables in the couple and lost for the other the former would be more informative than the latter. Results Both trials enrolled 805 patients of who 787 had data available at day 1 of who 533 survived and 254 did not. In the univariate analysis, \u0394P averaged 13.7 \u00b1 3.7 and 12.8 \u00b1 3.7 cmH 2 O (P = 0.002) in nonsurvivors and survivors, respectively. In each single Cox model, Hazard ratios (HR) were 1.05 (1.02-1.08) (P = 0.005), 1.04 (1.01-1.08) and 0.985 (0.972-0.999) (P = 0.023) for \u0394P, Pplat and Crs, respectively. PEEP and VT were not significant risk factors in any model. In the model with \u0394P and Pplat used together, each of them kept significance [HR 1.31 (1.07-1.61) and 1.13 (1.02-1.26)]. In the model with \u0394P and Crs both lost significance and the same was true in the model using Pplat and Crs. Discussion \u0394P was a significant predictor with a 5% increase in mortality per each cmH 2 O increment of \u0394P, a result similar to that found by Amato et al. However, Pplat conveys the same information. This is likely due to the fact that VT and PEEP were similar in each group of both trials and not different between survivors and non survivors. Conclusion When strict lung protective mechanical ventilation is applied to ARDS patients \u0394P, Crs and Pplat were risk factors of mortality. \u0394P and Pplat bring distinct and significant information.",

Little is known about evaluation of PEEP setting based on end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure at zero flow (PEEPtotL) in PP. We hypothesized that esophageal pressure (Pes) was lower in PP than in supine position due the relief of the weight of the mediastinum. Hence, the PEEP level to achieve positive PEEPtotL should be lower in PP. Furthermore, the inclination of the body should also influence the measurements of Pes. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the variation of endexpiratory esophageal pressure at zero flow (PEEPtotes) in PP and in supine position, each at two body inclinations, and the subsequent effects on PEEPtotL and transpulmonary driving pressure (\u0394PL). Materials and methods A prospective interventional physiologic study was performed in patients with severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FIO 2 < 150) and requiring PP. Pes was measured with an esophageal balloon. Transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) was computed as the difference between airway pressure and Pes. DPL was computed as the difference in Ptp at the end of inspiration and at the end of expiration at zero flow. Chest wall elastance (Est,cw) was calculated as the ratio of end-inspiratory Pes minus PEEPtotes divided by tidal volume. Endexpiratory lung volume (EELV) was measured by nitrogen wash-out method. Thorax angulation was 30\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 in supine position (SP) and 0\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 in PP. From PEEP set according to the low PEEP/FIO 2 table of the ARMA trial (1), PEEP level was further adjusted to achieve PEEPtotL close to 3 cmH 2 O. Measurements were done in supine position and after 1 h in PP. Results Twenty patients were included. PEEPtotes did not vary significantly between SP(30\u00b0) and PP(0\u00b0 or 15\u00b0). However, opposite variations were found according to thorax angulation in PP: a rise of 1.9 (SD 1.7) cmH 2 O in PP(0\u00b0), p = 0.005 and a drop in PP(15\u00b0) of 2.2 (SD 3.2) cmH 2 O, p = 0.06. In a complementary analysis, PEEPtotes was studied in four positions [SP(30\u00b0), SP(0\u00b0), PP(0\u00b0) and PP(15\u00b0)] and followed an inversed U-shape pattern with mean values of 8.6 (SD 3.2), 12.8 (SD 2.7), 10.2 (SD 3.3) and 2.6 (SD 2.1) cmH 2 O, respectively. These differences were statistically significant (Holm adjusted p value for multiple comparisons <0.05) except between SP(30\u00b0) and PP(15\u00b0).",

Hence, PEEPtotL at PP(0\u00b0) was computed at the EELV in SP(0\u00b0), allowing to eliminate the impact of the change of EELV between postures: 77% of PEEPtotL changes were due to change of posture per se [+3.7 (SD 2.6) cmH 2 O, p < 0.05]. Between SP(30\u00b0) and PP(0\u00b0), posture effect on PEEPtotL variation was +2.7 (SD 4.5) cmH 2 O, p = 0.055. A linear mixed model disclosed that rise of PEEPtotL was explained by PP for an amount of 2.7 (SD 0.44) cmH 2 O and by thorax angulation for 0.13 (SD 0.02) cmH 2 O per degree (p < 10 \u22126 ). PP was associated with lower \u0394PL [\u22121.0 cmH 2 0 (SD 1.3), P = 0.004].

Discussion Variation of thorax angulation significantly alters Pes and Ptp values. Splitting the variation of Pes into those due to change in either EELV or posture allows a better understanding of the impact of PP on Pes. Conclusion PP(0\u00b0) was associated with Pes rise as compared with SP(30\u00b0) and Pes drop when compared with SP(0\u00b0). However, when analyzing PEEPtotL variation due only to posture change (and not EELV change), a rise of almost 3 cmH 2 O of PEEPtotL was seen in PP(0\u00b0) compared to SP(0\u00b0) or SP(30\u00b0).

Numerous strategies have been assessed to improve this tolerance, such as pharmacological sedation or sophrology. Music therapy has been showed to be effective in healthcare settings, in particular in ICU invasively ventilated subjects [1] . We therefore investigated the effect of a musical session provided by a trained caregiver on NIV tolerance and efficacy in ICU patients with acute respiratory failure. Patients and methods MUS-IRA is a randomized 3-centers, 3-arm open-label trial (PHRIP 2013). Subjects included were adult acute respiratory failure patients for whom the physician in charge considers NIV as indicated with a level of consciousness allowing a benefit from the musical intervention (Glasgow Coma Scale >11). Non inclusion criteria were contra-indication to NIV; severe hearing impairment; withdrawal of life sustaining therapies with expected survival of less than 48 h; subjects included in another trial dealing with acute respiratory failure. NIV was conducted in the same fashion in the three arms of randomization. The \"musical intervention\" subjects received a 30-min L-type music session with the MUSIC CARE\u00a9 software (2), with a sleeping mask concealing the eyes. The \"sensory deprivation\" group had the sleeping mask and the insulating around-ear headphone, during a 30-min period. The \"NIV alone\" group had their NIV conducted as it is usually in our ICUs. The main objective was to determine if a musical intervention improved NIV tolerance, measured by respiratory comfort, and ventilation parameters at 30 min of NIV in comparison to conventional care. The respiratory comfort was assessed by a nurse or nurse assistant blinded to the treatment arm with a numeric visual scale (from 0 to 10) at the initiation (T0), after 30 min (T30), and at different time points of each NIV session. The primary endpoint was the change in respiratory comfort at initiation and after 30 min of the first NIV session. The secondary endpoints were NIV failure and the percentage of patients requiring anxiolytics or sedative during NIV sessions. The comparison performed in a pre-specified fashion was between \"musical intervention\" group and \"NIV-only\" group. A total of 99 subjects had to be randomized in order to show a 2-unit difference in respiratory comfort between two groups. This number was extended to 114 because of missing data on the primary endpoint.",

Discussion Our study failed to evidence a significant effect of a musical intervention on the reduction of respiratory discomfort during the first NIV session of acute respiratory failure ICU patients. One may hypothesize that the improvement provided by NIV (which patients received in all three groups) was such that it outweighed and/or masked a potential effect of the musical intervention. Further analysis are planned to investigate the respiratory comfort and the evolution of physiological parameters during the subsequent sessions. Conclusion Applying a musical intervention early in the course of a treatment by NIV during acute respiratory failure did not modify respiratory comfort. Further research is warranted.",

Eligible patients were those receiving IMV at pre-hospitals and aged >18 years. The aim was to define pre-hospital IMV practices and determine their consequences on mechanical and blood gases. Results Eighty patients were included with 71.3% being men and middle-aged 55 years. J28 survival was 60%. The aetiologies of intubation were 38.8% traumatic, 16.5% of cardiac origin, and 12.5% of brain vascular origin. The preferred mode of ventilation was assist-control volume-control (98.75%). The median tidal volume was 6.9 ml/kg of predicted body weight (PBW; interquartile range (IQR) 6.4-7.7 ml/kg PBW) with a range of 5.1-10.4 ml/kg PBW. Lung protective volume ventilation was employed in 70.7% of patients (6-8 ml/kg PBW). The median PEEP was 5 mmHg (IQR 5-5 mmHg). 34% of patients had a change of PEEP's level compared to factory settings. The average respiratory rate was 15 cycles/min (SD 14-16 cycles/min).

In all, 56% of patients had hyperoxemia gases (PaO 2 : 126 mmHg, IQR 96-307 mmHg) and 56% hypercapnia gases (PaCO 2 : 46.3 mmHg, IQR 40.1-52.9 mmHg). Overall, 46.3% of patients needing brain protection (brain injury, stroke) had hypercapnia gases. Discussion Lung-protective ventilation is not defined strictly by tidal volume between 6-8 ml/kg PBW, but is a strategy that includes PEEP, respiratory frequency, and FiO 2 (1). This study suggests infrequent use of PEEP titration in favour of delivery of a high level of oxygen and infrequent utilisation of lungprotective ventilation in French pre-hospital medicalization.",

Conclusion French pre-hospital invasive mechanical ventilation must be optimized with a full strategy of lung-protective ventilation with regards to tidal volume, pressure, oxygenation or capnia. A comparative study following a guided ventilation strategy is currently underway to determine if a ventilatory protocol would produce better results than the free will of the emergency physician. Therapeutic interventions were volume resuscitation in 13 cases, optimization of sedation in 12 cases, vasopressor managment in 12 patients and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 3 cases. The occurrence of complications during transport was significantly increased in mechanically ventilated patients (p = 0.009), especially with inspiratory oxygen fraction >0.5 (p = 0.00), sedation before transport (p = 0.001), vasopressor requirement before transport (p = 0.03) and with the night shift team (p = 0.007). Sedation and mechanical ventilation were the independent risk factors of IHT complications. Conclusion This study confirms that the intrahospital transport of compromised patients leads to a significant number of complications.

The aim of this study was to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients who experience medical emergency team calls and to evaluate initial care provided in medical specialty wards. Patients and methods It's a two-months prospective study (03/2016-04/2016) including all in hospital emergency calls. These calls were given by medical wards teams (dermatology, Gastroenterology, internal medicine, dermatology, cardiology and radiology) to the emergency physician when a deterioration in their patient's condition was documented. Emergency and intensive care department emergency calls were excluded. Results There were a total of 51 calls for 40 patients, principally hospitalized in internal medicine ward (21) and cardiology ward (14) . Emergency calls were given by a physician in 47 cases and a nurse in 4 cases, during the night in 32 cases (62%). The greater number of calls was received Monday (13) and the week-end (11) . Cardiac arrest (7), respiratory distress (28) and hemodynamic instability (16) were the reason's call. The median emergency team arrival time was 10 min. The majority of patients (88%) required acute care for on average 35 min spent time. The vital signs were monitored and adequate therapy was initiated by the attending physician for 17 (33%) patients. Cardiovascular support was necessary for 24 (47%) patients, respiratory assistance was necessary for 3 patients. A transfer for the intensive care unit was indicated for 16 patients (31%) and delayed for 13 patients because of a lack of beds. In hospital mortality was 23% (n = 12). In hospital cardiac arrest and coma (Glasgow coma scale \u22648) were the principal prognostic factors. Delayed emergency time arrival was not associated with a greater mortality. Conclusion In hospital emergencies were associated with an increased mortality. A better recognition of the instable patients may improve their prognostic.",

A high mortality rate has been reported in the most severe LD cases, for which the optimal antimicrobial regimen remains controversial. Patients and methods This is a retrospective, multicentre observational study including patients admitted to ten intensive care units (ICU) for severe LD over a 10-year period. Patients were stratified according to the antibiotic strategy administered: (1) fluoroquinolones versus no fluoroquinolones and (2) monotherapy versus Results 211 patients with LD requiring ICU admission were included. A fluoroquinolone-based and a combination therapy were administered to 159 and 123 patients, respectively. 146 patients (69%) developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome, 111 (53%) a shock, 56 (27%) an acute renal failure that required renal replacement therapy, and 54 (26%) died in the ICU. In-ICU mortality was lower in the fluoroquinolone group as compared to the no-fluoroquinolone group (21 vs. 39%, p = 0.01), as well as in the combination therapy group as compared to the monotherapy group (20 vs. 34%, p = 0.02). In multivariable analysis with covariate adjustment including a propensity score for fluoroquinolone treatment, a fluoroquinolone-based therapy, but not a combination therapy, was independently associated with a reduced risk of mortality (HR 0.4, 95% CI [0.2-0.7], p = 0.002) ( Table 7) . Discussion Our results, which suggest a beneficial effect on mortality of a fluoroquinolone-based therapy in patients with LD who required ICU admission, are consistent with previous studies showing a nonsignificant trend in favor of fluoroquinolone use in patients hospitalized for LD [1] . The limited number of patients in our study precluded assessing the individual effects of distinct molecules within the fluoroquinolone class. Conclusion Patients with severe LD receiving a fluoroquinolonebased antimicrobial regimen in the early course of the management in ICU had a lower in-ICU mortality, which persisted after adjusting on significant covariates. A combination therapy did not provide significant mortality benefit in the current study.",

This potentially devastating condition is generally thought to be due to highly virulent bacteria such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin-secreting Staphylococcus aureus or to slowly-growing organisms such as mycobacteria and other Actinomycetales. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical, microbiological and radiological features of NP in intensive care unit. Patients and methods Monocenter restrospective study. All patients hospitalized between January 1st 2009 and July 1st 2016 with an ICD-10-CM code for pneumonia (J1X) in an 18-bed medical ICU were included. All chest X-rays and CT-scans obtained during the stay were screened in order to select patients with NP, which was defined as a new cavity or a zone with no contrast enhancement within a pulmonary consolidation. Diagnosis was confirmed by a senior radiologist. Medical records of included patients were reviewed to describe clinical and radiological presentation, demographic characteristics, microbiological results and outcome. Results Among 1009 screened pts, a definitive diagnosis of NP was made in 37 pts (3.7%). Median age was 57 [interquartile range 48-69] years, 68% were males, median SAPS2 was 43. Half of the pts were immunocompromised due to hematologic malignancy (7 pts), solid tumor (7 pts), immunosuppressive therapy (2 pts) or HIV infection (2 pts). Eight pts had chronic respiratory disease, 8 had diabetes, 11 were alcoholic. Pneumonia was community-acquired in 21 pts, including 3 pts with aspiration pneumonia. The remaining NP were nosocomial diseases, including 5 pts with ventilator-associated pneumonia. In 4 pts, pneumonia was considered to be acquired by hematogenous spread, including 1 patient with endocarditis. Most pts had severe hypoxemia, with a median minimum PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of 153 [102-203] mmHg. Twenty-three pts were intubated, and median duration of mechanical ventilation was 4 days. Eighteen pts developed septic shock, and 3 had renal replacement therapy. In-ICU mortality was 32% (12 pts). Chest CT-scan was performed in all pts but 1. One or more cavity was observed in 33 pts, whereas lung necrosis without excavation was present in 4 pts. Most pts (25) had more than one lesion, involving more than 1 pulmonary lobe in 22 pts and both lungs in 15 pts. Median size of the largest lesion was 42 [24-78] mm. Broncho-alveolar lavage was performed in 25 pts, and bronchial aspirate in 18 pts. One or more pathogen was isolated in 29 pts; in 4 pts, the final diagnosis was non-infectious (neoplasia in 3 pts and 1 crack lung), and all samples were sterile in 4 additional pts. Fifteen pts had polymicrobial infection. Overall, the most frequently isolated pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9 pts), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7 pts) and fungi (7 pts). Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae were isolated in 5 and 6 pts, respectively. All cases involving P. aeruginosa were diagnosed in immunocompromised patients. In contrast, most patients with S. aureus infection (6/7) and all patients with K. pneumoniae infection were immunocompetent. Among pts with proven infection, none underwent surgical treatment, but percutaneous drainage was performed in 3 pts.",

Epidemiology of SPG and long-term outcome remain poorly known. Amputations are serious offense to body integrity but can benefit from rehabilitation and prosthetics. Our objectives were to describe epidemiology of SPG and to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) once rehabilitation was achieved. Patients and methods A prospective and retrospective, multicentric study was performed. Adult patients hospitalised between 2005 and 2015 were included. They must have undergone at least two major amputations (whatever the level) and been discharged in a specialised rehabilitation center. HRQOL was assessed with generic scale EQ-5D-3L by phone call. Epidemiologic data were extracted from hospitalization reports. Results Nine centres on 13 participated, 30 patients were recruited and medical letters were available for 25 of them. SPR was observed in a majority of female (60%), aged around 50 yo. Mean intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay was 39 (\u00b1 21) days. Infectious agents were in majority Gram positive cocci (64%), but Escherichia Coli took an important part (20%), similar to Meningococcus (16%). All patients were amputated of the two lower limbs and 80% were quadruple amputees. HRQOL estimated wit EQ index was inferior to the French reference. However, patients rated themselves their health state as similar to the reference and even superior to the reference French value before SPG, using visual analogue scale (VAS). Main decrease in VAS was 22 points (95% CI 13-31). Intense pain due to phantom pain was the main factor of impaired EQ index. Painkillers use was statistically dependant of antidepressants use. All patient except one said they would be willing to be treated again for SPG. Conclusion Symmetric peripheral gangrene is mainly due to Gram positive Cocci but also Escherichia Coli. It leads to severe amputations with impaired HRQOL which could be improved by better analgesic strategies. However patients consider themselves as being in good health and would be willing to be treated again. This should be taken into account before withdrawing life-sustaining therapies.",

The combination of anti-infective treatments and aggressive organ failure supports often allows stabilisation of the clinical condition, but patients become then exposed to intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infectious and noninfectious complications that significantly impact on prognosis. Whereas immunosuppression is commonly viewed as a major risk factor of death in septic shock, whether it is associated with an increased incidence of ICU-acquired complications is unclear. The present study aimed at addressing the course of septic shock across clinically significant subgroups of patients with and without immunosuppressive conditions. Patients and methods This was a 8-year (2008-2015) monocenter retrospective study performed in a 24-bed medical ICU. All consecutive adult patients diagnosed for septic shock within the first 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included. Septic shock was defined as a microbiologically proven or clinically suspected infection, associated with acute circulatory failure requiring vasopressors despite adequate fluid filling. Patients were considered either as nonimmunocompromised or immunocompromised, this latter subgroup being categorized in three subgroups according to the underlying immunosuppressive condition: solid neoplasm, hematological malignancy and HIV-or drug-induced cellular immunosuppression. Furthermore, administration of intravenous chemotherapy during the last 3 months and leuconeutropenia defined by leucocyte count <1000/mm 3 and/or neutrophil count <500/mm 3 were collected as well. Survival status was assessed at ICU and hospital discharge. We focused on the most likely infectious, hemorrhagic and ischemic complications occurring after the first 48 h in the ICU. The impact of the underlying immune status on 3-day and late mortality was assessed using a cause-specific proportional hazard model. To assess the impact of immune status on ICU complications, we performed two competing risk analysis model (Fine-Gray and cause-specific proportional hazard model). A landmark analysis with the choice of a 3-day fixed landmark point was performed to correct for the substantial immortal time bias. The SAPS2 was used to adjust for admission severity.",

The rational for a systematic oxygen supply in patients with acute coronary syndrome is based on a limited number of data. The links between hypoxia and ischemic or arrhythmic electrocardiographic abnormalities have been known for a long time. The risks associated with hyperoxia have been well described in physiological studies (increased coronary resistances, decreased coronary blood flow). A recent large RCT demonstrated that liberal oxygen administration during the acute phase of myocardial infarction may increase the level of cardiac enzyme and the infarct size [2] . FreeO 2 is a recently developed device that automatically titrates oxygen flowrate with the aim to maintain constant the SpO 2 , around the target set by the physician. We evaluated two SpO 2 targets using automated oxygen titration with FreeO 2 during acute coronary syndrome and evaluated oxygenation delivered with usual manual oxygen therapy. Our hypotheses were that high rates of hypoxemia and hyperoxia would occur with manual titration, and would be reduced with automated oxygen titration.",

Moreover, the necessary antibiotic treatment may lead to a selection of multiresistant bacteria. Therefore, health authorities mandate the registration of specific nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and catheter-related blood stream infections and wound infections. Unfortunately, there is no unified definition of nosocomial infection and its incidence depends on the screening intensity. We therefore hypothesized that a computer algorithm using the prescribed antibiotic treatments may be an objective alternative for the detection of nosocomial infections. Patients and methods As a gold standard, infections were scored by an infectious disease specialist. The Java algorithm uses the following inputs: patient identifier, admission/discharge day, antibiotic name/dose/route of administration, administration days of antibiotics. The algorithm distinguishes infections on admission and nosocomial infections. Sensitivity needs to be increased while maintaining specificity for actual use in an environment with varying antibiotic prescription practices. The algorithm should also be further validated in lager datasets for different ICUs.",

However, in patients with multi-organ dysfunction, clinicians need guidance to understand which procedure is likely to identify HLH-etiology. In patients with HLH, pancytopenia or spleen enlargement are the rule. However, other organ involvement has to be sought in each specific case.

In France, public health autorities's reports recommended that every patient presenting with stroke symptoms should be admitted in SUs. But beds in these units are still insufficient, so triage seems unavoidable. We aimed to explore admission criteria in SUs in case there is only one bed left. In this situation, is the time window allowed thrombolysis the main criteria for neurologists to accept a patient? Patients and methods This was a postal and e-mail survey that took place from January 1st to July 31st 2016. An anonymous questionnaire was sent to the 164 neurologists who usually work in the 21 SUs in the region of Ile de France. The survey was in two parts: the first one encompassed questions about the physicians themselves (age, professional status, current job tenure), and, then, in the second part we presented different clinical cases including the type of stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or transient ischemic attack), age ranges of the patients, and different time slots during nyctohemeral period.

We asked to neurologists if they already refused a patient when it stay one bed in their unit, to keep it for a patient who could be eligible for thrombolysis, and the answer was positive in 64%. There was no significant difference in accepting or denying regardless of the type of stroke or the different time slot. Concerning the age ranges, we found a significant relationship only with ischemic stroke (p = 0.014), as the oldest patients above 90 years old were more refused than the youngest. Discussion Our study has several limitations, and probably the main is the risk of declarative biases due to descriptions of practices that differ from those encountered in real life. A more rigorous methodologic analysis, including a prospective study following patients suffering from stroke, would perhaps more reflect the reality. Conclusion In case there is one bed left in their SUs, neurologists seem to accept most patients, even if thrombolysis is off limits. Only the age ranges may influence their decision if the patient suffers from ischemic stroke. More studies are necessary to confirm or not these results.",

However, the normal value of this parameter (observed in patients without raised intracranial pressure) remains debatable (from 5 to 5.9 mm) highlighting the importance measurement precision. Is this pilot observational study, we aimed to compare the ONSD values obtained with two different US device. Introduction Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the main cause of disability after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) but its pathophysiology remains unclear. We currently have no effective treatment to reduce the incidence of DCI. Study of pathophysiology has long suffered from a lack of consensus definition of DCI. It is only recently that experts have proposed that in observational studies and clinical trials aiming to investigate strategies to prevent DCI, the 2 main outcome measures should be: (1) cerebral infarction identified on CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging or proven at autopsy, after exclusion of procedure-related infarctions; and (2) functional outcome [1] . Currently, experimental studies must therefore meet this new definition. The aim of our study is to identify the extent preclinical studies using this new definition of DCI. Materials and methods Systematic review from PUBMED using key words. Consulting additional bibliographic databases including gray literature, scientific meeting abstracts and review of the bibliography of selected articles completes the research. Inclusion criteria: (1) description and/or modification of an SAH model in rats or mice; (2) study of cerebral vasospasm and/or DCI. This research is performed in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations [2] . Results Seventy-one publications from 47 teams are included. 11 teams are responsible for 77% of publications. 8 different methods are used for induction of SAH. The most used model is the direct blood injection into the cisterna magna. Vasospasm is studied by brain imaging (n = 18) mainly in the first 72 h and histology (n = 32) until the tenth day. A positive diagnosis of vasospasm is placed in histology in 28 of 32 studies. Cerebral ischemia is sought in 24 publications including one in cerebral imaging. Neurological deficit is wanted by sensorimotor tests in 13 publications. Three models use animals with comorbidities (hypertension, obesity and chronic inflammation). No model uses female population. Among the 10 most cited studies, none of them is studying cerebral ischemia by imaging. Discussion Differences with human pathology of SAH are raised about the pathophysiology leading to SAH and its anatomoclinical characteristics. In particular, there is an over-representation of models of posterior circulation. Similarly, study of vasospasm remains the most studied criteria to the detriment of the ischemia and neurological deficit, even though it is the first cause of disability after SAH (Table 11 ). Furthermore, we can note an over-estimation of the incidence of vasospasm in the included publications compared to the clinical epidemiological data. Study methods of vasospasm and cerebral ischemia may be criticized. Results 25 cases were collected, 12% of deaths during 2015, with average age of 7, 32 \u00b1 6, sex ratio was M/W 1.5, the average weight of our population was 34, 72 \u00b1 32 kg, reason for admission was head injury following an PRA for 8 cases, cranial traumatism following defenestration for 2 cases, stroke for 10 cases, and epilepsy for 6 cases. The Glasgow Average on admission was 6.88 \u00b1 3, mean hospital duration was 6.75 days. All patients were ventilated on admission, use of vasoactive drugs were needed for 20 patients. Brain death diagnosis was made by two intensive anesthetist doctors for each patient looking for brain death clinical signs. Cerebral angiography was made for 10 patients. The procedure of organ donation has been discussed in 17 cases, parents have accepted donation in two cases, refusal of both parents in 9 cases, refusal of one parent in 6 cases. In 8 cases the patient died before starting the procedure. We successfully removed both kidneys and liver for our first donor and just one kidney and cornea for the second one. Discussion In front of persisting imbalance between the needs and the number of grafts, removal of pediatric organs should be enhanced by optimizing children potential donors and their families management. It is important to encourage the involvement of a health care team and humanly participate with the coordination teams to deal with parents and dare to seek their consent to donate. Conclusion This study shows out a significant pool of potential organ donors in pediatric intensive care. Hence the need to lead out activities within our society to make of them effective donors.",

Discussion Even though the benefit of LTVV applied for all ICU patients is still to be demonstrated, our results show that women are exposed to much more \"aggressive\" mechanical ventilation with potentially harmful consequences. LTVV seems to be achievable for all intensive care patients since 78% of men admitted in our unit are ventilated with maximal Vt \u2264 8 ml/kg of predicted body weight. Exclusion criteria were mixed lung condition, presence of chest tube, prone position, and severe hemodynamic impairment. Patients were classified according to standard definition in: normal lungs, COPD or ARDS. Patients were ventilated in INTELLIVENT-ASV \u00ae mode and positioned in semi-recumbent. Respiratory mechanics variables were measured once per patient during the first 24 h after ICU admission together with arterial blood gases. Airway pressure and flow was measured by a proximal pneumotachograph. Static compliance (CSTAT) and inspiratory resistances (RINS) were measured using the least square fitting method [2] . CSTAT was also calculated as the ratio between tidal volume and driving pressure. Expiratory time constant (RCEXP) was measured as the ratio between volume and flow at 75% of maximum expiratory flow and calculated as the product of CSTAT MEAS and RINS. Anova was performed to compare results between each lung condition. Data are presented as median [25th-75th quartiles]. Table 12 .

In order to determine a method based on aiming the best respiratory comfort of the patient, the authors studied the impact of several levels of assist in NAVA, on the respiratory behaviour and comfort, of patients undergoing weaning of the mechanical ventilation. Patients and methods This study was single-center prospective, open, randomised, of current care. Patients staying in a critical care unit, undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation for an acute respiratory failure, and recovering spontaneous ventilation, were included. For every patient, an optimal level of assistance in pressuresupport ventilation was determined and called AI 100, with which an equivalent level of assistance in NAVA called NAVA 100 was set. From this level, six other NAVA levels were determined, by increase or decrease of 25% stepwise, respectively called NAVA 25, NAVA 50, NAVA 75, NAVA 125, NAVA 150 and NAVA 175, and applied in a randomized order. For every situation, after obtaining a stability of the end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (ETCO2), pressure, volume, flow, and electromyographic activity of the diaphragm (Edi) were recorded during 5 min. An arterial gazometry was performed, and respiratory comfort was assessed by using the dyspnea numeric scale, the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) by Banzett, and the Respiratory Distress Observational Scale (RDOS). All parameters were compared between ventilatory modes, by using variance analysis ANOVA. Results Ten patients were included. Between NAVA levels, no difference was observed regarding tidal volume (Vt, p = 0.143) and arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO 2 , p = 0.141). The Ti/Ttotneu ratio and AUC Editot (the area under curve of Edi superior to trigger) raised significantly for NAVA 25, the lowest NAVA level, respectively p = 0.005 and p < 0.001. The dyspnea numeric scale and MDP by Banzett showed no significant difference along the NAVA levels, respectively p = 0.412 and p = 0.107. However, RDOS score was significantly higher for the low levels of assistance NAVA 25 and NAVA 50; p < 0.001. Conclusion With variation of the NAVA level, our patients showed a respiratory behaviour similar to the findings described previously in the litterature. The level of assistance did not seem to influence the patient's feeling of dyspnea, despite an obvious raising of the ventilatory demand. However, Ti/Ttotneu ratio, AUC Editot and RDOS clinical score appear as potential useful tools to detect underassistance issues in patients undergoing NAVA.",

Materials and methods All intubated critically-ill patients with disturbed level of consciousness were assessed using both the FOUR score and the GCS. The FOUR score and the GCS were compared regarding their predictive value for successful extubation at 14 days after intubation as a primary outcome measure. The 28-day mortality and the neurological outcome at 3 months were used as secondary outcome measures. Results Eighty-six patients were included. Median age was 63 [50-77] years. Sex-ratio (M/F) was 1.46. Median GCS was 7 [3-10] while median FOUR score was 8.5 [2.3-11] . A GCS \u2264 7 predicted the extubation failure at 14 days after intubation with a sensitivity of 88.5% and specificity of 68.3% (Youden index = 0.57 95% CI [0.35-.7]) whereas a FOUR score <10 predicted the same outcome with a sensitivity of 80.8% were transferred to a rehabilitation centre, 10 were transferred in acute care hospital in step-down unit, 29 were discharged directly to home.

Discussion The current data demonstrate that, in our centre, most of the patients with weaning failure can be successfully weaned. Despite a prolonged ICU stay before referral, weaning outcomes were similar to those reported in other countries and organizational models. Introduction Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations are now the third leading cause of mortality all over the world and in Tunisia. There still are many controversies in their management and mainly the indications of antibiotic treatment and corticotherapy. In Tunisia and despite many valuable studies, only few studies were focused on the \"Tunisian\" daily practice in case of acute and severe exacerbations of COPD. Thus; we decided to perform this study. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of our patients, the blood gas exchange findings, the medical treatment, the ventilator support and to analyze their outcome.",

The mean SAPS II score was 35 \u00b1 10 with an APACHE II mean score of 22 \u00b1 5. The most common cause of COPD in our patients was tobacco smoke with a mean consumption of 32 \u00b1 10 pack-year history of smoking. The most frequent COPD condition in our patients was chronic bronchitis (n = 29; 72.5%). Six patients received home oxygen therapy. Three patients had lung emphysema and one patient had both restrictive and obstructive syndrome. At admission, the mean Glasgow coma scale score was 12 \u00b1 3. The mean Ph was 7.21 \u00b1 0.13 with a mean bicarbonate level of 32 \u00b1 10 mEq/l. Lung infection was the most common cause of exacerbation (n = 26; 65%). The other recorded causes were: pulmonary edema (n = 3), pulmonary embolism (n = 2) and pleural effusion (n = 5). Twenty-two patients (55%) received systemic corticotherapy and 33 patients received antibiotic therapy. Sixteen patients (40%) did not receive bronchodilator medicines. Fifteen patients (37%) required noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Eighteen patients (45%) was intubated and required invasive mechanical ventilation. Ventilatory support was not necessary in the other seven patients (17.5%). The mean duration of hospital stay in our ICU was 111 \u00b1 98 h. Sixteen patients died in our ICU with a mortality rate of 40%. The most frequent causes of death were septic shock (n = 5), acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure (n = 2). Four patients were transferred and twenty patients were discharged from hospital. Only SAPS II was independently associated with poor outcome (p < 0.001). Conclusion Our patients may be classified severe COPD according to GOLD recommendations. There is a big gap between our daily practice and the international recommendations. We still have a widespread use of corticotherapy and antibiotic therapy. We need effective interventions to implement existing evidence-based guidelines into daily practice in exacerbations of COPD.",

The consequences of bicarbonate levels change during ICU stay are not well studied. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between bicarbonate concentration change during ICU stay for AECOPD and long-term survival. Long-term patient's status (surviving or deceased) was checked by consulting the register of civil status. Results During the study period 440 patients were consecutively admitted for hypercapnic COPD exacerbation (84.5% males, median age: 68 years, median pH at admission: 7.28 and median HCO 3\u2212 : 30.6, NIV was the first ventilation modality in 65% and survival at ICU discharge: 84.3%). Blood gas analyses (at ICU admission and discharge), and long-term vital status were available in 239 patients (survival at a median follow-up of 7 years was 31.2%). Bicarbonate levels change were inversely associated with the long-term survival (Table 14 ; Fig. 12 ).

The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), since 1970, is the gold standard of recommended devices due to the diversity and relevance of provided parameters. Pulse contour cardiac output (PiCCO) represents an interesting alternative to the PAC. However invasiveness and delicacy in the collection and interpretation of data make that the risk/ benefit ratio of these techniques is to be worrying. Our purposes were to assess the diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic utility of invasive monitoring by PAC and PiCCO compared to non-invasive or less common tools. Patients and methods Evaluative retrospective study comparing two arms of ICU patients with invasive versus non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Were included, the ICU patients who had hemodynamic and/or respiratory failure and how required the use of hemodynamic exploration. Exclusion criteria were age less than 18 years and the lack of data on the medical record. Outcomes: diagnostic utility was judged on the consistency and quality of data interpretation, therapeutic usefulness on the therapeutic changes and favourable response following these therapeutic adjustments during the 1st 24 h of monitoring, and prognostic assessment was judged on the ventilation period, length of stay and mortality. Results 131 cases of hemodynamic monitoring were included (PAC/PiCCO: n = 71 and common tools: n = 60). The superiority of the invasive monitoring was objectified with the consistency of interpretation of the collected parameters (91.5 vs 78.4%, p = 0.044) and therapeutic changes derived by interpretation (83 vs 66.7%, p = 0.041). No benefit found on the clinical improvement following the modifications guided by monitoring (50 vs 57%, p = 0.72) and (31 vs 47%, p = 0.074) for the hemodynamic and respiratory responses respectively. The duration of ventilation and stay-length did not differ with those of the standard group. A higher mortality was found with age >50 years ( Introduction Septic cardiomyopathy is commonly encountered in patients with septic shock. Most studies suggest no correlation between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and mortality in patients with septic shock. In the other hand, the initial left ventricle global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) seems to be a better prognostic factor. However its time course evolution remains to be precisely defined. The present study aims to describe the evolution during the first days of the septic shock and to establish the prognostic value of this novel parameter in critically ill patients. Materials and methods A prospective observational single center study was performed in the ICU. After approval of the local ethics committee, all patient admitted to the ICU for septic shock without known pre-existing heart disease were eligible. In these preliminary results, 13 of the 100 planned patient were included and analysed. Echocardiography was performed on the first day, and repeated daily during ICU stay until norepinephrin was stopped. LVEF and LVGLS were acquired in apical two-chamber, four-chamber and long-axis views. Patients were divided into two groups: survivors and non survivors. Results Of the first 13 patients included mortality in the ICU was 23%. Left ventricular ejection fraction at admission (LVEF) was not significantly different among the survivors and non survivors (respectively 53% \u00b1 12 vs 28% \u00b1 9; p = 0.089). Initial LVGLS was lower (which indicates better function) in survivors as compared to non survivors (\u221213% \u00b1 12 vs \u22126% \u00b1 0.5; p = 0.044). Time course evolution of LVGLS is displayed in Fig. 15 .",

LVDD was established according 2 definitions: 1 complete definition based on American Society of Echocardiography criteria [2] , and 1 simplified definition. Results LVDD prevalence was 61.4% (102/166) according to the complete definition and 56.0% (93/166) according to the simplified definition. LVVD patients were older (66.5 vs 55 years, p < 0.0001). Male sex predominated (67.6 vs 48.4%, p < 0.0001). LVVD was more associated with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, diuretics use, and new onset of atrial fibrillation, whether the full definition (25.5 vs 0%, p < 0.0001; 52.9 vs 34.4%, p < 0.0001; and 27.5 vs 14.1%, p = 0.044 respectively) or the simplified definition (28 vs 0%, p < 0.0001; 53.8 vs 35.6%, p = 0.002; and 29 vs 13.7%, p = 0.018 respectively). Unlike the full definition, LVDD patients detected with the simplified definition were associated with more important intra-hospital mortality (28 vs 12.5%, p = 0.016). Discussion LVDD prevalence found in our study is similar as in previous works in the cardiology setting. Higher incidences of atrial fibrillation and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in the LVDD patients can be explained by a more important left atrial dilation, and a higher incidence of other cardiomyopathies in the LVDD cohort. Conclusion LVDD is a frequent abnormality in the ICU setting, associated with an important morbi-mortality. LVDD identification should alert the physician for an higher risk of new onset of atrial fibrillation and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.",

It may reduce cardiac output and O 2 delivery relative to tissue need. Low mixed Central venous O 2 saturation (ScvO 2 ) has been used to optimize cardiac output and O 2 delivery relative to tissue needs. The use of ScvO 2 to predict fluid responsiveness is unclear. Objective: To determine whether ScvO 2 is a good indicator of fluid responsiveness. Patients and methods We carried out a prospective study in the medical intensive care unit of the teaching hospital in Mahdia over a period of 48 months. All patients with circulatory failure were enrolled. At baseline (t = 0 min), hemodynamic measurements were performed with a PICCO. After baseline measurements and blood sampling, 500 cc of fluids were given over 30 mn and hemodynamic measurement were performed at the end of fluid perfusion. Concomitant vasoactive and sedative drugs and ventilatory settings remained unchanged. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac index >15%. Results A total of 68 patients requiring volume expansion were included. The causes of acute circulatory failure were septic shock (n = 45), cardiogenic shock (n = 11), and dehydration (n = 12). Among the 68 included patients, 33 (49%) were responders. ScvO 2 was significantly lower in no responders group (62 \u00b1 11 vs 68 \u00b1 12, p = 0.046). However ScvO 2 variation was significantly higher in responders group (10 \u00b1 8 vs 6 \u00b1 7, p = 0.041). The area under the ROC curve for ScvO 2 was 0. 37 (95% CI 0.23-0.5). The best cutoff value of ScvO 2 was <55% (sensibility = 36%, specificity = 8 8%, positive predictive value = 75% and negative predictive value = 60%). The area under the ROC curve for ScvO 2 variation was 0.65 (95% CI 0.52-0.78). The area under the ROC curve for delta ScvO 2 was 0.5 (95% CI 0.43-0.7). Conclusion In this study, we can't recommend strongly the use of ScvO 2 as a predictor of fluid responsiveness.",

Despite its apparent simplicity, the failure rate of tactical tourniquet application remains high in real life experience. Some personality traits of the combat lifesavers could explain this high failure rate. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between different personality traits and the performance for applying the tactical tourniquet. Materials and methods This observational, cross-sectional study concerned French soldiers of two theaters of operations in Africa (SANGARIS in Central African Republic and BARKHANE in Malia), between October 2015 and April 2016. The performance for application of the tactical tourniquet SOFFT \u00ae was evaluated during simulation sessions and included the time for application and its effectiveness, demonstrated by the elimination of the popliteal pulse Doppler signal. A performance score included both an application time shorter than 60 s and the interruption of the Doppler signal. Personality traits were assessed using validated questionnaires: the Self-Esteem Scale of Rosenberg (SES), the HEXACO personality inventory for empathy (HEXACO), the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) and the B\u00fcssing Altruism Scale (BAS). Results A total of 72 participants (mean age 27 \u00b1 4) were included in the study. The effectiveness rate of tactical tourniquet use was 51%. Only 26% of the participants performed this LSI in accordance with the performance score criteria. Some of the personality traits were associated with significant differences in the performance of the SOFFT \u00ae application. Thus, the most empathetic soldiers (high HEXACO levels) had weak performance scores, in comparison with those with a lower HEXACO level (p = 0.016). Participants with a high BAS level were also less performant for application of the tactical tourniquet. However, combattants with a high SES applied more quickly and more efficiently the tactical tourniquet (Fig. 16) . Conclusion Personality traits are associated with significant differences for the performance of tactical tourniquet application, a crucial LSI in setting of both combat and terrorist attacks. Personality traits can be evaluated easily, using validated questionnaires. Finally, the \"adaptive learning\" could represent an adequate approach to improve the LSI training, according to the personality traits of the trainees.",

Introduction Though efforts have been made in the previous decades to teach medical students the basics of clinical research, their own involvement in such studies infrequently occurs before they become residents or assistants. The medical courses include lessons on experimental and clinical research methods, which may be difficult to integrate out of a concrete context. On the other hand, much has to be learned for medical students in ICU within a short training period. Involving medical students in research could increase their workload, and may affect their evaluation of the training period. We therefore aimed to have medical students making their first foray in clinical research through a practice evaluation. We asked them to evaluate the change in workload and their global satisfaction afterward. Patients and methods Four medical students (4th year of medicine) agreed to participate to a clinical trial through an evaluation of medical practices. None of them had had a previous experience in this field. Gastric stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) was chosen by the students among other subjects. Two references were provided, in French, to give them clues on how to conduct the research. The first one was a free web access medical thesis exploring the medical practice on ulcer prophylaxis in three ICU in Toulouse. The second was a chapter of a reference textbook. Three weeks thereafter, it was decided in a meeting to have a 2 steps approach. First, they realized an evaluation of the local practices through a daily monitoring of patients admitted during a 2 weeks period. All patients admitted for an estimated period of more than 48 h were eligible. Exclusion criteria were baseline ulcer treatments and active gastrointestinal bleeding. Second, a brief survey of seniors and residents' knowledge on the subject of matter was performed. In both steps of investigation, the recorded criteria were those described in the French health authority's recommendations. At the end the study period students participated to statistical analysis and interpretation of results. The study was presented to the department's staff by the students. A few weeks later, they were asked to evaluate this experience. Results During the study period, 27 patients were screened and 14 patients (Mean age 57.4 \u00b1 23.5 years, 4 female, 10 men, mean SAPS II 48 \u00b1 25) were included and observed during a total 105 ICU days (7.5 \u00b1 6.4 days/patient). 6 (42.9%) patients received stress ulcer prophylaxis at least once, and during 71.6 \u00b1 32.6% of their ICU stay. According to French recommendations, SUP was not justified at least once in 5 out of the 6 patients. In 29% of SUP days, no criteria supported this prescription. 8 patients did not receive SUP. These patients were observed during 66 days. According to guidelines, SUP should have been offered in 2 patients during 15 ICU days. In this subgroup of patients no criteria for SUP was found in only 13 (19.6%) days. Among the studied criteria, a strong link between SUP and enteral nutrition was found (p < 0.0001, Fisher exact test). 8 senior intensivists and 6 residents answered the survey. The estimated prevalence of this condition was evenly distributed between less than 1% and more 10% among responders. 30% of them ignored whether guidelines were available, and 80% of all responders ignored the strength of evidence of the guidelines. All the known risk factors for stress ulcer were cited, but the two major criteria (mechanical ventilation and coagulation abnormalities) were recognized in less than 30% of responders. 86% of responders declared that only proton pump inhibitor were appropriate for SUP. All students declared that adding this study to the global burden of the training period was manageable. They pointed out that building a study was a difficult task and declared that it was an added-value to the training course, and a good experience in their medical course. They would agree to do it again. Discussion This study is limited by its single center design, and the little number of participating students and included patients. Conclusion Helping medical students make their first steps in clinical research seems to be feasible in ICU. The students greatly appreciated this experience and judged it improved their training period. It could also represent a mean for patient management improvement.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate frequency, typology and severity of discrepancies in ventilatory settings in a Tunisian medical ICU, and to identify factors associated with patient-ventilator asynchrony. Patients and methods An audit observational study was conducted in a 7-beds medical ICU during 1 month period (August 2016). All consecutive ICU patients requiring invasive or non invasive mechanical ventilation were included. The data collected were: patient's characteristics, initial diagnosis, SAPSII, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, type of mechanical ventilation, ventilatory mode, prescribed ventilatory parameters and interfaces. Were analyzed, peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure, auto-PEEP, volume and inspiratory and expiratory flow waveforms. Patient-ventilator asynchrony was defined as: ineffective inspiratory efforts, auto-triggering, delayed cycling, double triggering and inspiratory waveform distorsion. Results During the study period, were performed a total of 160 ventilatory settings observations. Mean age was 59.9 \u00b1 16.8 years, mean SAPSII score was 36.3 \u00b1 11.1. 157 (98.1) patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation and 3(1.9) were on non-invasive mechanical ventilation.

Discrepancies in ventilatory settings were found in 55(34.4) patients. 23(42) patients had frequent patient-ventilator interactions. Ineffective efforts and double triggering were the two most common asynchronies (43.4 and 13.1% respectively). Patient-ventilator interactions were assessed as severe in 9(16.3). Patient-ventilator asynchronies were associated neither to the severity (SPAS II, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) nor to the respiratory system mechanic (peak inspiratory pressure, autoPEEP, plateau pressure and driving pressure). A simple intervention on the ventilatory settings corrected the asynchronies in all the patients. Conclusion The discrepancies in ventilatory settings reveals frequent. Patient-ventilator asynchronies are the most observed discrepancies. This could be the consequence of a frequent lack of monitoring. 11 janvier 2006) .

            "text": "Introduction Hematological malignancies may be directly responsible for life-threatening organ failures through tumor lysis syndrome, tissue infiltration, coagulation disorders and obstruction of anatomical structures. Respiratory and renal dysfunctions are commonly encountered in this setting. In addition, some patients may develop a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, responsible for acute circulatory dysfunction, so-called sepsis-like syndrome. Besides advanced life support, the treatment of those cancer-related organ failures relies on timely administration of chemotherapy. In this study, we addressed the features and outcomes of patients with sepsis-like circulatory dysfunction related to hematological malignancies, with particular emphasis on the impact of chemotherapy on organ failures. Patients and methods This was a 9-year (2007-2016) single-center retrospective observational study performed in a 24-bed medical ICU. Inclusion criteria were age \u226518 years AND presence of a hematological malignancy, either already known at the time of ICU admission or diagnosed during the ICU stay AND development of acute circulatory dysfunction requiring vasopressors without any evidence of underlying infection. Patients with hematological malignancies who received chemotherapy in the ICU were retrieved through the information systems from hospital pharmacy units involved in the delivery of cytostatic drugs, and all medical files were individually checked for inclusion criteria. Data were collected from individual files, and included the overall severity through the APACHE2 and SOFA scores computed at the time of ICU admission. The SOFA score was thereafter computed daily. Endpoints were the in-ICU and in-hospital vital status. Results Over the study period, 24 patients (12 men, 12 females) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Their mean age was 62 \u00b1 16 years. Most of them were in good functional condition since 22 had a performance status of 0. Two patients were previously immunocompromised (severe combined immune deficiency and kidney transplant). The underlying haematological malignancies were distributed as follows: non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 18) including 6 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia (n = 4), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1). Seven patients had malignancies newly diagnosed in the ICU. Otherwise, the median time from diagnosis to ICU admission was 8 days (min 2 days; max 4357 days). The primary reasons for ICU admission were respiratory (n = 11), renal (n = 7), neurological (n = 6) and hemodynamic (n = 5) failures. The mean admission APACHE II and SOFA scores were 18.8 \u00b1 9.0 and 8.6 \u00b1 3.4, respectively. The mean blood lactate level was 4.9 \u00b1 1.4 mmol/L. Mechanisms of organ failures were related to tumor lysis syndrome (n = 10), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n = 4), lung (n = 4) and liver (n = 2) malignant infiltration, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (n = 2). Acute circulatory failure requiring vasopressors was present prior to chemotherapy in 18 patients, and was secondarily triggered by chemotherapy in 6 patients. In the first group, administration of chemotherapy was associated with a dramatic improvement in the circulatory conditions (Fig. 19) as assessed by the trend in the hemodynamic SOFA variable. The in-ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were 75 and 79%, respectively. The main cause of death was untractable multiple organ failure (n = 14).",

EndoPTP1B\u2212/\u2212 or wild type (WT) mice received LPS (1 mg/kg) or saline solution followed by five injections of glucose (2 g/kg) or saline solution each hour 12 h after LPS. Endothelial deletion of PTP1B was generated by crossing LoxP-PTP1B with Tie2-Cre mice. The exploration of the cardiac function is performed 20 h after LPS injection (H 2 O) by the non-invasive The fractional shortening tended without significance to decrease in mice receiving LPS with glucose compared LPS alone. Analysis of cardiac tissue showed a significant deleterious impact of LPS and glucose association on oxidative stress (gp91phox) and inflammatory responses with increased cytokines production and expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1). The cardiac gene expression of CHOP and GRP78 (endoplasmic reticulum stress) in WT showed no change in the condition LPS with glucose. Moreover, expression of PARP1, sensor of DNA damages and activator of glucotoxicity pathways, is increased with glycemic variability. Despite an increased expression of PTP1B when LPS and glucose are combined in wild type mice, endothelial PTP1B deletion gene only reduced significantly the cardiac expression of iNOS, PARP1 and PTP1B. Finally, cardiac systolic function tended without significance to be impaired by glucose and LPS combined. Discussion The absence of variation in the gene and protein expression of CHOP and GRP78 shows a lack of endoplasmic reticulum stress in our model despite cellular stresses generated by glucose. Conclusion In endotoxinic model, the variability of blood glucose aggravates the effects induced by an inflammatory trigger in the cardiac tissue without significant impaired cardiac function in this model. Endothelial deletion in PTP1B, involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, provides improved glycemic control, with a reduction of pathological activation of iNOS, a marker of abnormal vascular function, and PARP1 marker DNA damage.

In 2009, European guidelines on antibiotic prophylaxis have changed and became more restrictive. The goal of this study is to describe changes in incidence, characteristics of patients, management, in-hospital mortality and pathogens in an overall population of patients admitted to ICU for a definite IE. Through comparison of two We observed a significant increase in crude annual incidence (153.0 \u00b1 14.9 vs 217.6 \u00b1 46.4; P = 0.018) and in incidence density relative to number of stays (0.79 \u00b1 0.08 vs 1.1 \u00b1 0.02% P = 0.004). Despite a trend towards increasing number of cases over the first period (1997-2009), slopes of incidence density curves clearly indicate an acceleration of the number of cases since 2009 (P = 0.017). Patients treated during the second period are significantly older and more severe than those treated before 2009. Surprisingly, use of invasive ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and vasopressor were significantly lower during second period. Contrariwise, resort to surgery has doubled between two periods. ICU mortality is significantly lower in the second period but in-hospital mortality remains unchanged. Concerning pathogens, we found a significant increase in incidence of Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., and no changes concerning intracellular bacteria, Enterococcus spp., Candida spp. or Gramnegative bacilli.",

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of heparin therapy. HIT requires the emergent discontinuation of heparin and the prescription of an alternative anticoagulant therapy that could be difficult to manage in SICU patients and enhance the risk of hemorrhagic complication. The early diagnosis of HIT in SICU patients remains a challenge. As thrombocytopenia could reveal several SICU complications, the 4T score of Warkentin is a useless tool to efficiently discriminate patients having or not HIT and the biological confirmation of HIT is delayed. The HIT Expert Probability (HEP) score has been reported to have a higher predictive value than the 4T score in non-ICU patients. The purpose of the study was to compare the HEP score to the 4T score in the early diagnosis of HIT in SICU patients.",

Non-inclusion criteria were pregnancy, age <18 years old and treatment with fondaparinux. The day the diagnosis of HIT was suspected, the HEP and the 4T scores were calculated and the following blood analyses were performed: the ID-PaGIA Heparin/PF4 test, the ELISA test, the heparin-induced-platelet-aggregation (HIPA), and the serotonin release assay (SRA). After completion of the study, all medical files were reviewed by a multi-disciplinary independent committee to discriminate patient having (HIT group) or not (SAFE group) a HIT. The final diagnosis was based on the medical history of the patient, on the time-variation of the platelet count while heparin was discontinued or not, and on the results of the venous Doppler of the 4 limbs. The committee was blinded from the value of the HEP and of the 4T scores, and from the results of the ID-PaGIA Heparin/PF4 test. The ROC curves of the HEP and of the 4T score were constructed. The sensibility (Se), the specificity (Sp), the positive predictive value (PPV), and the negative predictive value (NPV) of the HEP and of the 4T scores were calculated, and the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were compared by using a Chi2 test.

All members of the family presented dizziness, weakness, anorexia and dyspnea. They reported the ingestion 10 h before of a juice in a traditional marriage. This juice was prepared using a plant called \"Oud El-Khir\" because of its capacity to be a lucky charm for the new married. The mean blood pressure was 130/60 mmHg. All members of the family experienced nausea, vomiting, anuria and hematuria. On physical examination, five members of the family had myalgia without other clinical signs. For all patients: cytological reports and sputum smear were negative (three times) for pulmonary tuberculosis. Hepatitis B and C serology were also negative. Chest x-ray was normal; Blood and urine culture were negative. In renal ultrasonography performed in five members of the family, there was a significant difference in kidney sizes and the corticomedullary differentiation was altered. Laboratory tests showed hyperglycemia and renal failure with metabolic acidosis in ten patients. Three dialysis sessions were performed. Samples of the herbal decoction were obtained from the juice. It was a dark brown suspension with fine brown deposit and a clear supernatant. It smelled a strong penetrating odor. Samples of both Rhamnus alaternus roots and its decoction were sent to be analyzed in the laboratory of toxicology in the Center for Emergency Medical Assistance of Tunis in Tunisia. Screening by GC-MS of both Rhamnus alaternus roots and infusion extracts, revealed the presence of anthraquinone glycosides such as 4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxoanthrac\u00e8ne-2-carboxylic acid (Rhein), 1,8-dihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-9,10-anthracenedione (Aloe-emodin) and 1,8-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-6-methylanthracene-9,10-dione (Physcion).

Despite therapeutic advances in the management of PF, mortality remains high up rates that exceed 50%. In Tunisia, the profile of such serious disease has not yet been described. The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of mortality in patients admitted in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with purpura fulminans. Patients and methods Retrospective review of case sheets was done. Sixty-nine children [median age 3 years (1.6 months to 11 years and boy to girl ratio 1.15) admitted between January 2000 and May 2015 with PF in PICU of the pediatric hospital Bechir Hamza in Tunis, were included. The diagnosis of PF was made in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with an extensive purpura. The PF is considered secondary to meningococcal infection if Neisseria meningitidis or soluble antigens are found at the blood culture or cerebrospinal fluid. In patients whose samples are negative, the PF is considered secondary to meningococcal infection if no other bacterial or viral origin is found to explain the purpura. For each patient enrolled, we have clarified the demographic data, the severity of clinical presentation by pediatric risk score of mortality (PRISM) and Glasgow meningococcal septicemia prognostic score (GMSPS) and therapeutic data. Results A mortality rate of 52% was observed for a predicted death by the PRISM score at 24.6%. Seventy-seven percent of the deaths occurred during the first 24 h. Twenty-five (69.4%) children died of irreversible septic shock and 6 (16.6%) children died of refractory hypoxemiae. Independent predictors of mortality were the initial severity assessed by the GMSPS (p = 0.001) and use of high doses of vasoactive drugs evaluated by the vasoactive-inotropic score (p = 0.026). Conclusion The mortality in our PICU is high, higher than predicted by PRISM. It occurred mainly within 24 h of admission. Early recognition and prompt initial antibiotic therapy continue to be the cornerstones of the successful management of this dramatic disease, reducing mortality.",

Analgesia nociception index (ANI: 0-100) has been proposed to clinicians to objectively measure pain in both conscious and anesthetized patient. ANI calculation results from sophisticated computing of sympathetic to parasympathetic tones balance using heart and respiration rate variability. Because we aimed to evaluate nociception during oro-tracheal intubation performed under apnea conditions, we conducted a study to test the reliability of ANI at monitoring nociception when respiratory rate was zero. Materials and methods ASA physical status I healthy informed and consenting adult volunteers participated in this experimental prospective trial. Demographic parameters were recorded and noninvasive hemodynamics (HD), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), pulsed oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) and ANI monitoring tools were installed. After a 5 min resting and stabilization the volunteers lying on their back were asked to perform a 30 s duration apnea starting on command at Residual Functional Capacity (RCF). After a wash-out period following this first apnea period (P1) and return to baseline parameters, the volunteers were asked again to perform a second 30 s duration apnea (P2) starting on command at RCF. Initiation of P2 coincided with 30 s ulnar nerve stimulation at the wrist (single twitch, 1 Hz, 25 mA). The different component of ANI (energy, mean, and instantaneous values: iANI), HR, BP and SpO 2 values were recorded at predefined time points: T0 (baseline values, just before apnea), T1 (end of apnea), T2 (T1 + 30 s), for P1, and the same predefined time points (T0\u2032, T1\u2032, T2\u2032) for P2. After the experiment, volunteers were asked to rate the pain intensity at the wrist during P2, using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS: 0-100). Evolutions of measured parameters were compared between P1 and P2. Values are mean \u00b1 SD. Results 21 healthy volunteers aged 34 \u00b1 10 were included. During P1 and P2, both iANI and energy were monitored. Mean VAS during P2 was 27/100. Figure 23 illustrates HD and iANI variations at T1/T1\u2032 and T2/T2\u2032. During P1, there is a remarkable stability of iANI at T1 (+1%) and no significant decrease at T2 (\u22123%). On the opposite, a progressive decrease of iANI was evidenced during P2 (\u22125% at T1\u2032), reaching a nadir 30 s after the end of nociceptive stimulation (\u221217% at T2\u2032). HD and Sp02 remained stable and comparable in P1 and P2. Conclusion Based upon our results, ANI seems discriminant and efficient at measuring nociception in the conditions of a short apnea of 30 s. ANI is thus probably a reliable tool to measure nociception during tracheal intubation. Our trial shows that HD is less sensitive than ANI to detect weak intensity nociceptive stimulus.",

Introduction Administration of fluid to increase cardiac output is a cornerstone of the hemodynamic resuscitation. The respiratory variation in aortic blood flow peak velocity (\u0394Vpeak) is the only variable to reliably predict fluid responsiveness in children. It requires assist control ventilation with high tidal volume (>10 ml/kg) [1] . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of assessing variation of stroke volume during a calibrated abdominal compression for the prediction of fluid responsiveness in children during acute circulatory failure. Patients and methods This study was approved by local institutional review boards (CPP Lyon Sud Est II). Written informed consent was obtained from parents. Oral consent of patients old enough to understand the study was also obtained. Patient, less than 8 years old of two paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), during a 1-year period inclusion, from September 2015 to September 2016 were selected. Stroke volume index was assessed with an echocardiography at baseline, after an abdominal compression (with a calibrated pressure of 25 mm Hg), at a return to baseline, and after a volume expansion (10 ml/kg of fluid challenge over 10 min). Pulse pressure (PP) Systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP); heart rate (HR), respiratory aortic blood flow velocity (\u0394Vpeak), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and respiratory vena cava diameter variation (VCIvar) were also recorded before volume expansion. . With the multivariate analysis, older age and male sex were associated with an increased risk for anaphylaxis death of any cause (p < 10-4).",

It is used to treat allergic type symptoms and as an appetite stimulator. Cyproheptadine poisoning has been rarely reported. That's why we conduct this study, to identify the epidemiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of cyproheptadine poisoning and to define the association between the ingested dose and clinical manifestations. Discussion Children in pre-school age are often at risk of domestic accidents in relation to their age and environment. They ingest products wrongly deconditioned or transferred into current use containers. These by catch happen to be in the kitchen at a large household or in the bathroom. They also ingest drugs for adults and thus higher dosage: these drugs are too easily left to reach those children who are not suspected faculties to identify seize and swallow what they take to candy. A study in India positioned intoxication hydrocarbons 1st place (50.9%), followed by organophosphates (11.9%), medication and caustic identify (4.8%) cases each [1] . In Oran (Algeria) taking caustic remains at the level of poisoning in children. Overall mortality by poisoning is lower in children compared to adults. (The products in question are heterogeneous drugs, household products, plants, pesticides) We recorded 01 death secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome following ingestion by siphoning gasoline. Conclusion At the end of our study, it appears that the acute poisoning in children is a very common event. However, developments remain favorable in most cases. This should not obscure the potential severity of the poisoning, nor lose sight of the necessary prophylactic measures. This prophylaxis should include education of the population, prevention of certain tragedies related to toxins or aberrant behavior, and triggering alerts to reduce morbidity and mortality related to poisoning.

The breathing patterns of every subject seems to influence the existence of inspiratory leaks. Some volunteers had more inspiratory leaks than others, and experienced a longer length of preoxygenation than others. This is probably explained by a different instantaneous inspiratory flow [2] . These results hypothesize that individual preoxygenation is needed for each subject. Conclusion Noninvasive ventilation allows effective preoxygenation despite the existence of leak.",

Materials and methods This experimental bench test was designed to evaluate the technical characteristics, ergonomics, accuracy of volume and pressure delivery, triggering performance, pressurization and depressurization capacity, patient asynchrony and leak compensation of transport ventilators. We simulated many patient profiles and conditions by adjusting lung compliances (30, 100 ml cmH 2 O \u22121 ) and resistances (5, 20, 50 cmH 2 O L \u22121 s), inspiratory efforts (2.5, 5, 10 cmH 2 O), and leakage levels (<1, 3, 6, 12 L min \u22121 ). The ventilators were used in pressure control, volume control, and pressure support ventilatory modes in non-invasive and invasive settings. Results Even if the technical characteristics of portable ventilators are quite similar, their ergonomics and performance are unequal. Major differences were found on tidal volume delivery, with mean relative errors ranging from +1.7 to \u221214.9%. Triggering delays and pressurization capacity also showed significant heterogeneity with a mean pressure time product (PTP) varying from 883 to 3018 cmH 2 O ms. The resistance of the expiratory circuit also differed across ventilators (from 0.96 to 1.82 cmH 2 O L \u22121 s), impacting the mean exhalation time and inducing air trapping and dynamic hyperinflation.

The induction procedure of anesthesia with target-controlled infusion was standardized using sufentanil and propofol. Timed OTI maneuver was performed after monitored (corrugator supercillii muscle) deep neuromuscular blockade (atracurium) was installed. OTI maneuver which duration could not exceed 30 s was truncated in 3 periods (P) of predefined duration. P1 lasted 10 to 15 s and corresponded with direct laryngoscopy. P2 lasted 5 to 10 s and corresponded with tracheal tube (TT) manipulation. Finally, P3 coincided with TT cuff inflation to controlled 35 cm H 2 O lasted less than 5 s. Recorded HD, BIS and ANI data were analyzed at 6 predefined time points. T0: stable baseline values after monitors installation, T1: post induction of anesthesia and just before OTI, T2: end of P1, T3: end of P2, T4: end of P3, T5 and T6, respectively 1 and 5 min after the end of OTI. Recorded parameters evolution was compared using standard statistics. Results Thirty-nine patients were included in this trial, but 4 were secondarily excluded because of OTI lasting more than 30 s.

P1 is characterized by a remarkable stability of all measured parameters. P2 and even more P3, are associated with intense and significant HD and ANI variations. ANI variations are completely superimposed, but opposite, to those of MAP and HR. BIS variations during TI were negligible. Conclusion Our data does not support the dogma but rather suggests that laryngoscopy may not be the most intense nociceptive stimulus applied to patients during OTI. Both laryngeal and/or tracheal stimulation resulting from tracheal tube passage and cuff inflation seem to promote very intense nociception.

Spontaneously breathing patients with cardiac arrhythmia considered for volume expansion for clinical signs of acute circulatory failure related to sepsis were included. Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound were used to record the stroke volume (SV) and IVC collapsibility index (cIVC) defined as [maximum expiratory diameter (edIVC) \u2212 minimum inspiratory diameter (idIVC)]/edIVC \u00d7 100 at baseline and after a 500 ml colloid infusion. Vena cava pertinent diameters were measured 15-20 mm caudal to the hepatic vein junction and recorded by bi-dimensional imaging on a subcostal long axis view. We measured the edIVC and idIVC during standardized (st) and unstandardized (ns) breathing, and calculated cIVCst and cIVCns before fluid loading. Standardized respiratory cycles consisted of a deep standardized inspiration followed by passive exhalation. A positive response to fluid loading was defined as an increase of the SV > 10%. Results Fifty-five patients were included, 29 (53%) with atrial fibrillation and 25 with atrial extrasystols >6/min. Twenty-nine (53%) patients were responders to fluid loading. A cIVCns > 19% predicts fluid responsiveness with a sensibility of 83%, a specificity of 68%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.83 (95% CI 0.72-0.94). A cIVCst > 39% predicts fluid responsiveness with a sensibility of 93%, a specificity of 88%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.93 [IC95: 0.86-1]. The area of uncertainty was restricted between 41 and 46%. Interestingly, idI-VCst < 12 mm predicts fluid responsiveness with a sensibility of 83%, a specificity of 88%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.93 (95% CI 0.86-1). The area of uncertainty ranged between 10 and 13 mm. Discussion A simple standardized inspiratory maneuver improves the accuracy of cVCI to predict fluid responsiveness with high specificity and sensibility and a limited grey area in patients with cardiac arrhythmia. Moreover, idIVCst demonstrates very good performance to predict fluid responsiveness. This easy to acquire parameter may be more suitable for bedside patient's management. Conclusion cIVCst is a powerful index to predict fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing patients with sepsis and irregular heartbeats.

At admission, the SOFA score was 2 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and the SAPS II was 31 . 31 patients (27%) were infused by vasopressors and 32 received mechanical ventilation support (28%). According to international guidelines, 49 patients (35%) were classified as high risk and 73 patients (65%) were classified as intermediate-high risk [1] . Thirty-nine patients (35%) received thrombolytic therapy. Day-28 mortality rate was 26%. At admission, when compared to 28-day survivors, non-survivor patients had higher lactate level (4.2 \u00b1 5.9 vs. 1.5 \u00b1 2.9 mmol/L, Mann-Whitney test P < 0.001), more frequent mottling around the knee area (50 vs. 24%, Chi squared test P = 0.02) and a lower urinary output (during the first 24 h) (0.5 \u00b1 0.6 vs. 0.9 \u00b1 0.8 mL/kg/h, Mann-Whitney test P = 0.02). Interestingly, 28-day mortality increased with the number of tissue perfusion alterations defined as hyperlactatemia (>2 mmol/L), oliguria (<0.5 mL/kg/h) and mottling presence.

Discussion Several studies in emergency and pneumology departments have investigated global hemodynamic parameters to predict outcome of PE patients. Low systolic blood pressure called \"shock\" and right ventricular dysfunction were identified as predictors of bad outcome. We were interested in the exploration of tissue perfusion because in septic shock several studies highlighted the discordance between global hemodynamic parameters and tissue perfusion. Moreover, during severe infections, hypoperfusion markers such as lactatemia, mottling or oliguria have been identified as predictive of ICU mortality. Recently, Vanni et al. [2] suggested lactate could be useful to identify normotensive PE patients at high risk of early death. Here, we found that, at admission, non-survivors patients at day-28 had more severe tissue hypoperfusion than non-survivors. In addition, mortality increased with the number of tissue hypoperfusion parameters.

Moreover, they are considered as the cornerstone in resuscitation of patients with shock states [1] . Accordingly, large amounts of fluids are often administered with a resulting positive fluid balance and fluid overload. Currently, several studies have identified a relationship between fluid overload and mortality [2] . Most of them have estimated fluid overload by calculating the cumulated fluid balance. This calculation is subject to numerous inaccuracies. Another method is daily measurement of body weight. Few studies demonstrated the link between ICU mortality and early weight gain [2] . The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between early weight gain and ICU outcome. Patients and methods All patients admitted from the 1st January 2012 to 31th December 2013 in a medical ICU of a University Hospital for which a weight was recorded on admission (Day 0) and at Day 3 were included. Demographic data, comorbidities, SOFA score, cause of ICU admission, length of stay and mortality were recorded. Weight changes were calculated by subtracting body weight as measured on third day from one as measured on admission. Conclusion This study is one of the few to establish that early weight gain is an independent risk factor for mortality in ICU patients. The body weight, though subject to difficulties and possible errors in measurement is an indirect marker of fluid overload. It remains to establish if the control of fluid overload based on an early weight-gain control strategy is likely to improve patients outcome.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PEEP variation during prone position on cardiac index in ARDS patients. Patients and methods Single center retrospective observational study performed on ARDS patients hospitalized in a medical ICU between July 2012 and March 2016. Patients included were adults fulfilling the Berlin definition for ARDS, undergoing at least one prone position session, under hemodynamic monitoring by the Picco \u00ae device, with availability of hemodynamic measurements performed before (T1), at the end (T2), and after the prone position session (T3). Prone position sessions were excluded if they were performed >7 days after ARDS onset. The following variables were recorded: demographic, SAPSII, ARDS severity and risk factor, SOFA score and cumulative fluid balance at PP onset, delay between ARDS session and PP session, hemodynamic, arterial blood gas, ventilatory settings, plateau pressure, catecholamine dose and additional treatments. Statistical analyses were performed using prone position session as statistical unit and mixed models taking into account both multiple prone position sessions by patient and multiple measurements during a prone position session. Variables associated with cardiac index with a p value below 0.1 in univariate analysis were selected for inclusion in a multivariable mixed logistic regression model, using backward stepwise descending selection. p < 0.05 was chosen for statistical significance.

Lack of support from caregivers was the first factor pointed out. It is a modifiable factor for further practice, especially in younger infants for witch breastfeeding has just begun and is still precarious. Conclusion Bronchiolitis is a high risk event for breastfeeding with about half of mothers in our hospital either stopping or diminishing their breastfeeding during hospitalisation.

Discussion The survey aimed to describe the techniques and modalities of PP in children, as well as several aspects of care associated with PP. The results show that the quality of care seems unaffected by the PP. The interviewed persons do not reported technical contraindication of PP. However, a special attention should be put on hemodynamic instability, tracheostomy or umbilical venous catheter. The survey reported the same complications in children and adult [2] . Finally, we also report the absence of paramedical care protocol for the PP. Future clinical studies will assess the impact of nursing protocols to limit complications, improve quality and comfort of care in children during PP periods. Conclusion The prone positioning in French-speaking pediatric intensive care units is not very well protocolized. Nevertheless, the care not seems to be significantly impacted by the prone positioning. Future research should focus on the evaluation of prone positioning nursing protocols.",

All patients on chronic hemodialysis admitted to the ICU for ARF in the period 2011-2015 were included. Patients with unknown diagnosis on ICU discharge were excluded. We defined ARF as either use of oxygen at \u22656 l/min dioxygen to achieve a pulse oximetry measurement of \u226590% (88% in COPD patients) or partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ) <60 mmHg on room air or need for mechanical ventilation plus of one of the following signs: a respiratory rate of >25 breaths/min, use of accessory respiratory muscles, or cyanosis associated to worsening dyspnea. The following data were collected: previous dry weight, time from last dialysis session, clinical, biological and imaging data on admission, number of dialysis sessions performed in ICU and total ultrafiltration volume required to withdraw oxygen therapy, weight on discharge, treatment and outcome, Patients were classified as having OPE (OPE group) or not (non-OPE group) based on the final diagnosis on ICU discharge. The two groups were compared with univariate analysis using non parametric tests. We did not find significant differences in temperature on arrival, white blood cells count nor NT-proBNP. Chest X-Ray interpretation was correct in 82% of cases of OPE patients but could not conclude in 46% of non-OPE episodes. Non-OPE patients had a more severe prognosis 38.5% of death (n = 5) versus 2.2% (n = 1).",

Clinical characteristics at study entry were similar between groups. Primary endpoint: 124 and 121 patients upon the 131 and 125 ICU survivors in usual care and intervention groups respectively, could be assessed for the primary endpoint. The discharge MRC score was 53 (IQR 44; 60) and 51 (44; 58) in usual care and intervention groups, respectively (P = 0.86), and was also not different between groups in patients under MV at time of study entry: 52 (IQR: 44; 58) (n = 95) and 49 (43; 57) (n = 89) (P = 0.26). Secondary endpoints: There was no betweengroup difference in discharge functional status as assessed by the ICU mobility scale in the whole population (P = 0.54) (P = 0.64 in patients under MV at study), or by the change in the Katz index from inclusion to discharge (P = 0.39) (P = 0.47 in patients under MV at study entry), or in the day-28 ventilator-free days [21 days (17; 22) vs 20 days (18; 21); P = 0.34]. The thickness of the rectus femoris muscle, assessed by echography at inclusion and discharge in survivors, showed a lower decline in the intervention group: \u22121.8 mm (\u22124.4; \u22120.2) vs \u22120.7 mm (\u22121.5; \u22120.25); P = 0.009.

For cefotaxime, median concentrations were respectively, CT50 and Cmin of 64.69 mg/L (IQR 20.17-97.52) and 28.61 mg/L (IQR 7.28-42.12) for a MIC target of 1 mg/L and a median dose of 7 g per day.Regarding imipenem, at a dose of 1 g three times a day, the median concentrations were respectively, CT50 and Cmin, of 7.30 mg/L (IQR 4.07-14.59) and 3.28 mg/L (IQR 1.84-5.43) for a MIC target of 4 mg/L. Only one patient had a CT50 greater than 4 MIC, and 60% of measured Cmin were under the MIC. Finally, for amikacin, the median Cmax was 51.14 mg/L (IQR 32.36-78.26) at a median dose of 24.3 mg/kg, for a target between 60 and 80 mg/L.",

Otherwise, antibiotics use have different consequences on bowel bacteria selection pressure. High biliary excretion of ceftriaxone and its long acting properties are responsible for a higher selection pressure in comparison with cefotaxime, an antibiotic drug with the same microbial spectre, lower biliary excretion, shorter action and a negligible effect on the bowel microflora. Patients and methods Consequently, a new antibiotic policy was implemented in a 350-bed general hospital in Lyon(France)  with the promotion of cefotaxim use instead of ceftriaxone from 1st January 2014 after an educational campaign in December 2013. Hospital-acquired (HA) bloodstream meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (3GCRE), Candida infections and Clostridium difficile colitis cases per month/1000 patient-beds were identified and reviewed throughout our 12 beds-intensive care unit (ICU). Monthly consumption of several antibiotics was monitored in defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1000 patient-occupied bed-days (1000 pt-bds) 24 months before (2012-2013) until 24 months after new antibiotic policy introduction(2014-2015). Results Physicians have quickly followed new antibiotic policy and average monthly consumption of ceftriaxone reduced by 82% (from 119.6 to 26.6 DDDs/1000 pt-bds, p < 0.001) and cefotaxime increased in 40% (from 27.7 to 68.8 DDDs/1000 pt-bds, p < 0.001) between the first and final 24 months of the study in ICU. Over the same periods, HA bloodstream infections rates were stable between the period before and after intervention for 3GCRE (1.71 vs 1.10 cases/1000 pt-bds, p = 0.33), MRSA (0.24 vs 0.08 cases/1000 ptbds, p = 0.41), Candida (2.09 vs 2.76 cases/1000 pt-bds, p = 0.45). And HA C. difficile infections were similar between the two periods (0.60 vs 0.67 cases/1000 pt-bds for the second period, p = 0.82) in ICU.",

The tariffs of reimbursement for the different DRGs and for the extra funding are updated every year. We measured the impact of these updates on the income of our ICU. Patients and methods DRG and length of stay of all the patients hospitalized during 2011 in our 12-bed ICU were extracted from the administrative database of our institution. We computed the reimbursement for the care of these patients with the tariffs of 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 (data from the Agence Technique pour l'Information Hospitali\u00e8re).

Ventilator associated pneumonia incidence, complications and mortality are well known in critically ill adults but probably under diagnosed in critically ill neonates. The main objective of our study was to evaluate the incidence of VAP in neonatal intensive care units, evaluate associated mortality and morbidity and find potential risk factors. Patients and methods This is a prospective, observational, singlecenter conducted in neonatal intensive care unit of Armand Trousseau hospital from 01/11/2014 to 31/10/15. All infants aged 28 days or less hospitalized in the service are included. Results 381 patients were enrolled including 327 intubated patients. 17 of 327 patients intubated presented VAP.

Because of impaired venous in-flow, occurrence of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), that is, intra-vesical pressure (IVP) above 12 mmHg), can compromise ECLS efficiency[2]. We hypothesized that prompt diagnosis and treatment of IAH among patients under ECLS for refractory cardiac arrest may improve ECLS performance and clinical outcome. We aimed to describe critically ill patients requiring ECLS for refractory cardiac arrest and presenting with IAH. Patients and methods This was a retrospective study of patients admitted to the ICU of the Besan\u00e7on University Hospital, between January 2010 and August 2016, who develop IAH under peripheral veno-arterial ECLS for refractory cardiac arrest. We collected data about diagnosis and treatment of IAH, ECLS performance, and patient outcome. Descriptive analysis was performed. Quantitative variables were expressed as median [interquartile range] and qualitative variables as number (percentage). Results During the study period, 202 patients (4% of the patients) were admitted to our ICU with femoral veno-arterial ECLS. Indication of ECLS was refractory cardiac arrest in 97 patients (48%), and among them, 28 (29%) developed IAH. Data were available for 27 patients who were included in the analysis. Maximum IVP was 22 [17-25.5] mmHg, which was reached 12 [5-19.5] h after ECLS onset. IVP was above 20 mmHg in 56% of cases. Curarization was initiated in 22 patients (81%). Ten patients (45%) required additional rescue laparotomy which was performed 2.5[2][3][4][5] h after the diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome. ECLS parameters during maximum IAH and their improvement after efficient treatment were presented inFig. 8. Clinically, there was a transient improvement of hemodynamic status after treatment, but hepatic and renal failures persisted. In our cohort, in-ICU mortality reached 100%. Deaths occurred after a median duration of ECLS of 32 h, and because of refractory multi-organ failure in 82% of cases. Conclusion Among patients under ECLS for refractory cardiac arrest, IAH is frequent, occurs early, and is associated with an extremely poor prognosis. IAH treatment is associated with an improvement of ECLS outflow and hemodynamic status. IAH among patients presenting with refractory cardiac arrest might be a strong prognostic factor per se. It's not excluded that early and efficient treatment of IAH, before occurrence of abdominal compartment syndrome, might improve the overall prognosis of critically ill patients under ECLS for cardiac arrest.Fig. 8 Comparison of ECLS parameters during IAH and after efficient treatment of IAHIntroductionVariable intensity systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is routinely used in patients undergoing extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to offset the increase risk of thrombosis in this population. Bleeding remains the most frequent complications and is independently associated with worse outcomes. Therefore, determining optimal anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis whilst minimising bleeding in adults on ECMO is a priority. This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of allocating patients on ECMO in two different anticoagulation patterns group resulting in a difference in anti-coagulation level. Patients and methods This is a randomised, controlled, unblinded pilot trial at two intensive care units. We enrolled critically ill patients who required ECMO (venous-venous [VV] or venous-arterial [VA]). We randomly assigned patients to therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin (target activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] between 50 and 70 s) or low dose heparin (12,000 units/24 h aiming for aPTT <45 s). Paired aPTT and anti-Xa assays were taken at a minimum once a day. The primary endpoints for feasibility were difference in mean heparin dose, aPTT and anti-Xa levels. All primary outcomes were log-transformed prior to analysis and reported as geometric means (95% CI) with overall differences determined using Repeat measures ANOVA. Results Between May 2014 and March 2016, 31 patients who underwent ECMO (9 VA and 22 VV) were enrolled; 16 were randomised to low dose and 15 to therapeutic dose heparin. The groups were similar dose compared to therapeutic group. There was no difference in thrombotic and bleeding complications between study groups. Conclusion In this pilot trial, administration of a low dose heparin protocol was feasible, and resulted in a significant difference in mean heparin dose administered and daily aPTT and anti-Xa levels between groups. Our findings support the feasibility of a larger study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low-dose anticoagulation compared with therapeutic heparin with regard to thrombotic and bleeding events in patients receiving ECMO.Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a frequent complication in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. In the specific case of patients treated with Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Life Support (VA-ECLS), epidemiology and risk factor of VAP treatment failure (VAP-TF) have been incompletely investigated. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of VAP and investigate the risk factors of treatment failure (VAP-TF) in a large cohort of ICU patients treated with VA-ECLS. Patients and methods All patients treated with a VA-ECLS between January 2013 and December 2014 were systematically included in the SARIC database. We retrospectively investigated all patients who developed a VAP during VA-ECLS. Diagnosis of VAP was confirmed by a positive quantitative culture of a respiratory sample. VAP-TF was defined as composite of death attributable to pneumonia and relapse within 28 days of the first episode. Incidence, risk factors and impact on outcomes were analyzed. To describe the population, Chi square test (categorical variables), Student t-test and Man Whitney tests (continuous variables) were used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Stepwise logistic regression was subsequently led to analyze risk factors for VAP treatment failure, with a threshold of p < 0.1 for inclusion in the model. Results At all, 162 patients underwent ECMO support for >48 h. During the VA-ECLS support, 86 (53%) patients developed a VAP. The ICU-mortality was 57%. The median time to onset of VAP was 3 days after the beginning of mechanical ventilation. The main pathogens identified were Gram-negative Bacilli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterobacteriaceae being involved in 80% of cases. VAP-TF occurred in 28 (32.6%) patients. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was the only risk factor for VAP-FT identified, odds ratio (OR) 3.7 (95% CI [1.4-10.6]; p = 0.02). The Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) trended to increase the risk of VAP-TF, OR 3.4 (95% CI [1.0-12.0]; p = 0.05). In the subgroup of patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia (PA-VAP), neither the duration of antibiotic therapy nor the use of a combination of antibiotics was associated with VAP-TF. Changes in clinical or biochemical parameters from the VAP diagnosis (day 0) to day 14, such as leukocytes, procalcitonin, temperature, blood oxygenation, VA-ECLS flow or pump rotational speed, were not able to predict VAP-T. A VAP relapse was associated with an increased of duration of mechanical ventilation, VA-ECLS support duration and length of ICU or hospital stay. With this sample size, mortality was not impacted by VAP. Discussion In this large cohort, VAP occurs early during VA-ECLS support while identified pathogens are those known to be involved for late-onset VAP. It could be explained by a very co-morbid status of patients in cardiac surgery ICU. VAP-TF occurs in 30% of patients, especially in PA-VAP while no guideline exists for the adequate antibiotic regimen and duration in patients treated with VA-ECLS. In addition, renal replacement therapy trends to increase VAP-TF. Antibiotics pharmacokinetics variations related to VA-ECLS and/or RRT support may contribute to this poor efficacy of VAP treatment. Conclusion VAP in patients treated with VA-ECLS is associated with an important morbidity, and infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears as a strong risk factor of treatment failure.

The objective of this study was to assess in a French national network of ICU surveillance, the incidence of SA ICU-acquired bloodstream infection (BSI) overall and according to resistance profiles, either methicilin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicilin-resistant SA (MRSA), and the temporal trends of the incidence over 10 years, adjusted for patients' case mix and ICUs' characteristics. Materials and methods Data from 2005 to 2014 were used. The incidence of BSI due to SA was assessed as the yearly ratio of ICUacquired (>48 h.) SA BSI per 10,000 ICU patients. Only the first SA BSI occurred during one ICU stay for a patient was taken into account. Univariable autoregressive models were performed to assess the temporal trend in the evolution of the annual incidence during the study period. Multivariable autoregressive model were performed to adjust on case-mix and other centers' characteristics with a significant annual trend selected in the univariable analysis. Results Of 265,035 patients included from an annual median number of 158 participating ICUs (144 in 2005, 213 in 2014), 9553 (3.6%) had an ICU-acquired BSI, and 1476 (15%) of them had at least one SA BSI (56 per 10,000 ICU patients). One-third of SA BSI (n = 491, 33%) was MRSA and 907 (67%) were MSSA. There was a significant decrease of annual incidence for all SA BSI from 2005 to 2014 (64 to 48/10,000 ICU patients; \u22121.8/10,000 ICU patients per year; p = 0.02). The raw annual incidence of MRSA BSI decreased significantly from 34 to 11/10,000 ICU patients between 2005 and 2014 (\u22122.21/10,000 per year; p = 0.001). There was no significant change in the incidence of MSSA from 28 to 35/10,000 between 2005 and 2014 (+0.35/10,000 per year; p = 0.53)(Fig. 9). By adjusting on annual ICUs variables significant in the multivariable model (percent of medical-surgical ICU, public hospital, percentage of patients with antibiotic therapy at ICU admission, central venous catheter exposure, medical admission and annual median of age) there was no significant change in the overall incidence of SA BSI, but a significant decrease of MRSA (p = 0.02). The temporal trends were similar in all French regions. Conclusion After adjustment on center variables, there was neither significant change in the overall incidence of S. aureus BSI nor in the incidence of MSSA BSI in ICU. However, the incidence of MRSA BSI decreased significantly. Moreover MSSA BSI did not significantly Introduction Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life threatening condition characterized by NK/T cells/macrophage overactivation resulting in a cytokine storm with multiorgan dysfunction. In adults, HLH is mostly secondary to cancers (mainly hematological neoplasms), infections or auto-immune diseases. HLH-etiology can be difficult to assess, especially in the critical care setting. Clinical and biological symptoms of HLH, its etiology and underlying immune deficiency being often mixed. Yet, targeting HLH-etiology is part of the ICU management in which supporting organ failure, early etoposide and empirical anti-infectious agents are routine. In this work, we assessed diagnostic yield of tissue biopsies to identify HLH-etiology. Patients and methods This single center retrospective study was conducted between 2007 and 2016. Medical records of all consecutive patients admitted with a HLH diagnosis (defined using HLH 2004 criteria) were reviewed. The performance of each diagnostic procedure was established.

It has been previously demonstrated that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration increases the risk of lung injury. ICU physicians are reluctant to use G-CSF in neutropenic patients with respiratory symptoms. However, data supporting this strategy are limited, consisting mainly of case series, retrospective data and experimental data. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of G-CSF administration on respiratory status in neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies admitted in ICU.

J Clin Oncol. 2013;JCO.2012.47.2365.Introduction Short term prognosis of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) has improved over the last decades with a mortality rate smoothing out to 10%. Main advances include management guidelines, improved understanding of the pathophysiology of most TMA syndromes and the development of targeted treatments. Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in adults, an element of the TMA syndromes, is caused by a severe ADAMTS13 activity deficiency chiefly through anti-ADAMTS13 auto-antibodies. Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown effectiveness for the treatment of refractory or recurrent TTP. In this study we focused on the short and long term complications of Rituximab administration in critically ill patients with severe TTP. Patients and methods All TMA patients requiring admission to St Louis hospital ICU from 2006 to 2015 were enrolled in the study. Clinical, biological and follow-up data were retrieved from the patients' medical chart and the hospital's electronic database. Specific complications of TMA-therapies were specifically sought. Data are presented as numbers (%) and medians (interquartile range). Groups were compared using non-parametric statistical tests (Chi square test or Mann-Whitney). Results During the study period, 124 critically ill TMA patients were recruited. There were 79 (64%) females, aged 44 years old (32-55). The TMA etiology included TTP in 81 (65%) cases, HUS in 24 (19%) and other TMA in 19 (15%) cases. Among the 81 TTP patients, 58 (72%) were females aged 42 years old (27-53). At diagnosis 66 (83%) patients presented with neurological symptoms, 50 (62%) with cardiac anomalies (whether clinical, EKG or biological anomalies), 46 (56%) with renal dysfunction, 28 (35%) with digestive symptoms. Day-1 hemoglobin was 7.4 g/dl (6.2-8.7), platelet rate was 11 G/l(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19), creatinine was 96 \u00b5mol/l (73-148) and LDH rate was 1880 U/l (1410-2638). ADAMTS13 activity was undetectable in all patients, with auto-antibodies in 61/70 (87%). 77%) received anticoagulation. Other therapies were administered in half the patients (n = 39) including Rituximab in 33 (41%) cases, pulse steroids in 23 (28%), Vincristine in 13 (16%), and other therapies in 11 (14%) (splenectomy, cyclophosphamide, twice daily PEX and vinblastine). ICU stay was 8 days (5-16) and 5 patients (6%) died in the ICU. The 33 patients receiving Rituximab in the ICU did not exert any benefit in terms of ICU or long term mortality. Rituximab administration was not associated with significant increase of ICU-acquired infections (9/33 (27%) vs 8/48 (17%), p = 0.2). No adverse reaction was noted following Rituximab infusion during the ICU period. Follow up was 1126 days (271-2001) and 3 additional patient died during follow-up. Eleven (14%) patients had TMA recurrence within 585 days (125-858). There was a trend toward a longer time to recurrence in Rituximab-treated patients (1475 days (427-2530) vs 136 days (80-749), p = 0.09). In addition, 22 TTP patients subsequently received Rituximab during followup either for TTP clinical recurrence or as maintenance therapy for persistent or recurrent ADAMTS13 undetectable activity. Long term complications potentially attributable to Rituximab included transient decrease in IgM levels (3 patients), serum disease in 1 patient, mild cognitive dysfunction in 1 patient and asymptomatic hepatitis B virus reactivation in 1 patient. Discussion Rituximab, when used in patients with severe/refractory TTP, seems safe at short and long term. This apparently low complication rate may be due to the relatively low Rituximab dosage used as compared to regimen applied to patients with lymphoma. High dose steroids might also have been protective against acute cytokinic reactions. Last, the retrospective nature of this study might also have undermined transient or mild Rituximab-related toxicity.IntroductionOutcome of critically ill patients with hematological malignancies has substantially improved over the last decade. However, data regarding the long term Quality of Life (QOL) of these patients are scarce. The purpose of this study is to assess post ICU burden and health related QOL, and to identify risk factors for long term QOL impairment. Patients and methods TRIAL-OH is a prospective, multicenter observational study that included 1011 patients with hematological malignancies who required ICU admission in 2010-2011 in 17 French and Belgian centers. Ninety days and 1 year after ICU discharge, HRQOL was was determined by applying the interview form of the short-form 36 questionnaire (SF-36), which measures HRQOL in 8 separate dimensions (0 = worst health state, 100 = best health state). Psychological distress symptoms were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Score (HADS) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). All datas were collected prospectively Results Two hundred and seventy-nine patients were evaluated at 3 months and 117 patients were evaluated at 1 year after ICU Discussion This multicentric study is the first to assess long term QOL in a large cohort of critically ill patients with hematological malignancies. Significant improvement in terms of short term mortality in this population do not fully reflect the impact of ICU stay.Prompt recognition of risk factors for impaired QOL and adapted therapy for anxiodepressive symptoms may improve their outcome Conclusion Critically ill patients with hematological malignancies have impaired QOL at 3 months and recovery is incomplete 1 year after ICU discharge. Long term QOL should be taken into account in the management of these patients.Service de R\u00e9animation m\u00e9dicale et M\u00e9decine hyperbare, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d' Angers, Angers, France; 6 R\u00e9animation m\u00e9dicale, H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Paris, France; 7 R\u00e9animation polyvalente, Groupe Hospitalier Intercommunal Le Raincy-Montfermeil, Montfermeil, France; 8 R\u00e9animation m\u00e9dico-chirurgicale, Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Le Chesnay, France; 9 R\u00e9animation polyvalente, Centre Hospitalier de Roubaix, Roubaix, France; 10 R\u00e9animation pneumologique, H\u00f4pital Cochin, Paris, France; 11 R\u00e9animation, Centre Hospitalier D\u00e9partemental -site de La Roche-sur-Yon, La Roche-sur-Yon, France; 12 R\u00e9animation, Institut Jules Bordet, Bruxelles, Belgium; 13 R\u00e9animation polyvalente, Hopital universitaire, Gand, Belgium; 14 R\u00e9animation m\u00e9dicale, C.h.u., La Tronche, France; 15 Service de biostatistique et information m\u00e9dicale, H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, Paris, France Correspondence: Yannick Hourmant -yannick.hmt@gmail.com Annals of Intensive Care 2017, 7(Suppl 1):O73Introduction Over the last two decades, advances in hematology and critical care management have translated into improved outcomes for critically ill hematological patients. Concerns have been raised about delayed admission to the ICU, however, the strength of evidence remains weak. Patients and methods In a substudy from Trialoh led by the GRRR-OH and published in 2013, we sought to assess how time from hospital to ICU admission is associated with hospital mortality. Data were collected from 17 ICUs from France and Belgium between January 2010 and May 2011. We used non parametric Wilcoxon tests and Fisher exact tests for baseline univariate comparisons across groups, p-value equal or below 0.05 were considered statistical significant. Regression logistic models were used to summarize predictive information for ICU mortality. Results Based on non-parametric estimation, the cutoff value of 3 days for time between hospital and ICU admission was best associated with mortality (OR 1.66 (1.28-2.15), P = 0.0001). Among the 1007 included patients, 592 were admitted before day-3 and 415 after day-3. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and myeloma represented about 70% of admissions in the two groups.",

Change in SVI and respiratory vena cava diameter variation or delta Peak before abdominal compression were not significantly correlated with change in SVI during volume expansion. PP variation and MAP variation during abdominal compression were not correlated with SVI variation after fluid challenge. The ROC curve analysis showed that SVI change during abdominal compression predicts fluid responsiveness. (AUC ROC = 0.93; CI 0.82-0.99). The best threshold was 9.28% with a sensitivity 75% (CI: 0.50-0.94) and a specificity of 93% (CI 79-100). AUROC of VCIvar was 0.70 (CI 0.48-0.91). AUC ROC of \u0394Vpeak was 0.58 (CI 0.34-0.81). Discussion Fluid responsiveness assessment, in children especially, is challenging when spontaneous breathing is authorized. It represents the vast majority of children hospitalized in PICU for acute circulatory failure. Abdominal compression is an old technic used to modify preload. Historically assessed with arterial pressure, it has never been formally evaluated so far. Our method seems quite reliable to predict fluid responsiveness, it was shown to be superior to VCIvar and \u0394Vpeak in our settings. Conclusion SVI variation during abdominal compression was the sole reliable method to predict fluid responsiveness in a mixed population of children, with and without spontaneous breathing, suffering from acute circulatory failure.Introduction Data on fatal anaphylaxis in France are limited. The aim of this study was to define the anaphylaxis mortality rate (AMR) in France between 1979 and 2011, in general and pediatric populations, and to examine the repartition by age, sex, cause and geographical regions. Patients and methods All deaths in France are recorded by a physician and death certificates are collected and analyzed by the CEPIDC Unit (National Institute of Health and Medical Research, INSERM). Each death certificate records primary and secondary causes of death, demographic data including sex, age, birthday and geographic region of death. Anaphylaxis related deaths were identified by using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes on the death certificates. Databases of the French National Institute for Economical and Statistical Studies (INSEE) are available freely (www.insee.fr). Data regarding the characteristics of the French population, by region, year, sex and age were collected. AMR were expressed per million persons and per year. All regression analyses were adjusted for age-effect and a multivariable log-linear Poisson regression model was further performed by including all of the predictors. Results There were 1603 anaphylaxis related deaths in metropolitan France between 1979 and 2011, with 39 deaths in pediatric population (age less than 20 years). AMR was lower in pediatric population (0.08 per million population per annum, 95% CI 0.05-0.1) than in general population (0.83 per million population per annum, 95% CI 0.79-0.88) (p < 0.01). In general population, AMR was higher in male sex (1.08 per million population per annum, 95% CI 1-1, 16) than in female sex (0.86 per million population per annum, 95% CI 0.78-0.89) (p < 0.01). Annual percentage change for case fatality rate was \u22122% (95% CI \u22122.5 to \u22121.5) indicating a decrease during the study period (p < 10-4). Latrogenic cause was the most common (63%), followed by \u00abunspecified\u00bb (23%), venom (14%) and alimentation (0.6%). AMR was the highest in persons aged \u226570 years (3.50 [95% CI 3.25-3.76]) and the lowest in children. Venom-induced mortality rate was higher in the South region (0.16) compared to the North (0.11) (p = 0.003). Only 8 food-induced fatalities were recorded (age < 32 years in 7)",

The aim of the present study is to compare the level of family satisfaction before and after the change of the ICU buildings. Materials and methods In a cross-sectional study we measured family members' satisfaction in two periods (Period I: July-September 2009, old buildings; period II: August-September 2016, new buildings).We used the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory Questionnaire (CCFNI) which includes demographic characteristics of family members (age, sex, relationship, education level) and that of patients (age, sex, marital status, SAPS II, diagnosis, outcome). The 14 items of CCFNI are scored 1 point if the answer was \"all the time\" or \"most of the time\" (indicating satisfaction) and a rating of 0 if the response was \"only sometimes\" or \"never\"). Results During the first and second study periods we included respectively 139 and 78 relatives of 44 and 17 patients, respectively hospitalized in our ICU for more than 48 h. The demographic characteristics of patients were similar in the two study periods: age: 59 years (IQR 19), 62% female, SAPS II = 33 (IQR 33), 78% were married, 82% of them were suffering from a chronic disease. Respiratory failure was the most frequent reason for hospitalization (73%), ICU length of stay was 14 days (IQR 19) and ICU mortality was 27%. After the transfer to new ICU, family members were more often satisfied with the information provided by the medical team (82 vs 46%; p < 0.001); only one-third of them (during both 2 periods) said they recognized the function of each member of the team (31 vs 29.4%, p = 0.4), 24.6 and 21.8% found inconsistencies in the information provided respectively in 2009 and 2016 (p = 0.38).

Data were analyzed by statistical methods in SPSS. Results A total of 36 patients were reviewed with a mean age of 21[14, 27]. All patients had no psychiatric background. All cases were self-inflicted. Mean ingested dose was 72 mg[34,143]. Mean delay of symptoms onset was 2 h[1, 4]. Neurological symptoms included delirium in 17% of cases, agitation, and hallucinations. Thirty-six percent of patients had peripheral anticholinergic symptoms. Gastric lavage was performed in 8% of cases. Four patients were admitted to ICU and required mechanical ventilation (MV) for neurologic impairment.Mean duration of MV was 17 h \u00b1 4. The outcome was favourable in all cases. Length of hospital stay was less than 24 h with an average of 22 h[20, 24]. There is no correlation between coma and assumed ingested dose. Conclusion Cyproheptadin overdose causes mainly neurological effects resulting from anticholinergic syndrom. Outcome is generally favourable. In spite of its rarity, the acute Beta blockers (BB) intoxication represents a major cause of mortality as a result of cardiovascular toxicity. (CS) is the most serious complication of this intoxication. The objectives of this study were to determine epidemiological, clinical, management and prognosis of cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating acute BB intoxication. Patients and methods This was a retrospective descriptive study conducted at the Medical Intensive Care Unit of CAMU over a 10 years period from January 2006 to December 2015. All hospitalized patients for cardiogenic shock complicating pure acute BB intoxication were included. Results Twenty-five patients were included. The average age was 23 \u00b1 7 years with a female predominance (sex ratio = 0.32). Three different molecules were involved: Acebutolol (n = 22), Atenolol (n = 2) and Propranolol (n = 1). The assumed average dose of ingested Acebutolol was 4000 [3200; 4800] mg. All patients were hospitalized in the first 3 h of taking and CS occurred within 3 h post ingestion in all cases. Bradycardia was reported in all patients who have ingested Atenolol or Propranolol. For patients who ingested Acebutolol, bradycardia was observed in 45% of cases (n = 10). Electrocardiographic signs included a ventricular atrioventricular block in 5 cases (as first degree in 3 cases and 3rd degree in 2 cases) and a membrane stabilizing effect in 10 cases. Digestive decontamination was performed in 14 patients (56%). All patients were treated using catecholamines: epinephrine in 18 patients (72%), both dobutamine and norepinephrine in 6 patients and only dobutamine in 3 patients. Glucagon was administered in 8 cases. Semi-molar bicarbonate intake as infusion of 500 ml into 30 min was prescribed to 10 patients who have membrane stabilizing effect. Eighteen patients required mechanical ventilation. The median duration of hospital stay was 72 [18; 120] h. Thirteen patients (52%) died within 24 h. Conclusion Management of Cardiogenic shock complicating acute BB intoxication is largely symptomatic and based on vasopressors, positive inotropic agents. Sodium salts could be an alternative measure in cases of membrane stabilizing effect, and temporary cardiac electrical pacing if high degrees BAV. In refractory shock circulatory support should be initiated as early as possible.Introduction Drug poisoning is a frequent cause of hospital admission especially in intensive care unit (ICU). Despite progress, hospital mortality of severe acute poisoning admitted in ICU seems to increase. Purifying methods such as continuous haemodiafiltration veinoveinous (CVVHDF) and molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), were developed with promising clinical results (1). However no analytical study has quantified accurately their purifying efficiency. It has not been assessed efficiency of the different compartments of the MARS nor its advantages over other methods of dialysis and filtration. The objective of this study was to quantify the purifying efficiency of the different compartments of the CVVHDF and MARS and to compare their respective efficiency in an ex vivo model in the most favourable conditions for these methods to assess their capability maximum treatment.Materials and methodsWe performed a ex vivo study based on manipulation bench simulating intoxication verapamil with a theoretical plasma doses of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/l injected into a central compartment of 5 L. Sampling and assays were carried out at various points of the circuit CVVHDF and MARS. The EC extraction coefficient [EC = (in concentration \u2212 out concentration)/in concentration] was calculated for each compartment of the CVVHDF and MARS as well as the amounts withdrawn by the sum each compartment allows assessing the overall capacity of each technique. Three manipulations were performed for each concentration. Results CVVHDF EC was 22, 22 and 28% for theoretical concentrations of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/l. For the 3 previous concentrations, EC was not constant but decreased steadily over the sessions to cancel 0 +10, +5 and +4 h for the different concentrations with even become negative after up to 14 h (end handling). At the end of handling the amount remaining in the central compartment was 6, 3 and 4% of injected dose. The amounts found in the effluent corresponded to 16, 20 and 28% of injected dose. In fact the amounts \"not found\" accounted for 78, 79 and 69% of injected dose. A desorption ultrasound membranes revealed that verapamil was fixed by the membrane of the CVVHDF. During all handling (12-14 h) concentrations in the circuit output \"patient\" for the CVVHDF have never been undetectable but remained stable. The different compartments of MARS led instead to an undetectable concentration at the exit of \"patient\" circuit. Similarly the concentration of verapamil remaining in the central compartment was undetectable at the end of the handling and this for all three concentrations studied. The quantities withdrawn by the hemodiafiltration compartment MARS corresponded to 8, 18 and 12% of the injected quantity, EC varied between 10 and 20% remaining stable. The quantities withdrawn by the coal compartment activated MARS was 92, 82 and 89% of the injected amount, the EC induced by MARS cartridge was stable in the order of 70% throughout the manipulation. Discussion CVVHDF and MARS are 2 effective purifying methods for removal of a simulated poisoning by verapamil. Their action and performance modes are very different. The membrane used in CVVDHF, adsorption verapamil realized 80% of the elimination of the toxic but with a residual salting out effect. A 8 h session of MARS had the effect of making them undetectable concentrations in the central compartment. The purifying effect is bound to 80% to the effect of carbon cartridge and for 10-20% to hemodiafiltration. Conclusion Clearance is a simple parameter that two determinants are EC and flow in the scrubber compartment. Pharmacokinetic modeling that require constant clearance. CVVHDF is characterized by a decrease in EC resulting in a variable clearance and preventing modeling. Elimination of verapamil is mainly due to unspecific binding properties. MARS is particularly effective in poisoning by verapamil. These results must be tempered by the fact that the conditions of our Introduction Beta-adrenergic antagonists are commonly used worldwide to treat hypertension, tremor, migraines, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, portal hypertension, angina and panic attack. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist with membrane stabilizing proprieties, is the most common toxic used in suicide attempts in Martinique. Through respiratory depression, bronchopasm, bradycardia, severe hypotension, and seizures may result from beta blocker intoxication, cardiovascular depression appears to be the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in severe acute beta blocker poisoning. Massive beta-blocker ingestions may cause prolonged QRS intervals may also be associated with refractory cardiac failure. Our objectives were to determine factors that are associated with the development of cardiovascular mortality. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective study over 10 years (January 2005 to December 2015), including all poisoned patients admitted and treated to the Emergency Department and the Intensive Care Unit. During this period, there were over 10 betaadrenergic antagonist exposures per year reported by the medical records department. These poisonings accounted for an average of 5 deaths annually. Results Three Hundred and eight patients (173 males/135 females) were admitted to the ICU for severe acute poisonings. Median age, 46.5% years (16-79); SAPS II, 120 (49-94). Among these 308 patients, 100 had ingested high doses of cardiotoxicants [class I ant-arrhythmic drugs (40%), \u03b2-blockers (15%), calcium-channel blockers (10%)]. Fifty patients (50%) survived, including 18 to prolonged cardiac arrest. Bad prognostic factors in ECLS-treated poisoned patients for beta blocker poisoning, were as follows: QRS enlargement on admission, SAPS II score on admission, Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) performance under massage, potential co-ingestants, arterial pH and lactate concentration (10.5 mmol/l). Conclusion The most important factor associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in beta blocker poisoning is the exposure to a beta blocker with stabilizing activity. The identification of risk factors allows physicians to identify patients at greatest risk. ECLS appears to be an efficient salvage technique in case of refractory toxic cardiac failure or arrest.Introduction Accidental acute intoxications are part of pediatric medical emergencies of our hospital experience. Children are most at risk of accidental poisoning due to characteristics of their development and their environment. Our Goal is to point to the toxic substances involved and to draw up the outcome profile in these patients. Patients and methods Retrospective study, covering all poisoning cases occurred in children under 6 years old and admitted to PICU in the university hospital Oran. We specified the characteristics of children, the nature of the toxic, symptoms on admission, the therapeutic aspect, the evolutionary mode and length of hospital stay. The duration of our study was to 4 years, from 2011 to 2015. Results In those years, the ICU admitted 365 poisonings occurring in children. They represent 13% of all admissions and 71% (260 children) under 6 years old. The average age of addicts was 5.08 \u00b1 1.36 years old with a male predominance. All product types were involved in the poisoning. According to data, 72% caustic toxic (189 cases) followed by drug poisoning (in 28 cases) and it is basically a case of psychotropic and narcotic (01 case), and then in descending order are rodenticides poison (19 cases), organophosphorus insecticides like (11 cases), Hydrocarbon (7 cases) ingestion of plants (3 cases), making cosmetics (2 cases) and poisoning of industrial glue (01 cases). Upon arrival at the hospital, 68% of young children had gastrointestinal disorders, and 2.3% had neurological disorders (seizures, ataxia and abnormal movements), 1.1% were in respiratory distress. After observation for most children, symptomatic treatment was introduced, 6 patients have been put under non invasive ventilation, intubation and mechanical ventilation was required in 01 patient for 16 days also put under Hemodynamic Support. The outcome was favorable with an average hospital stay of 28 h in survivors, and 01 death occurred following an ingestion of hydrocarbons.",

In PreOx study[1],Hanouz et al.  showed that the preoxygenation is faster with positive pressure ventilation with or without positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) than spontaneous ventilation. However, during preoxygenation imperfect seal between the face mask and patient's face can induce a leak decreasing its effectiveness. We assume that noninvasive ventilation could cancel the effect of the leak in non-obese subjects. Materials and methods Experimental prospective study, randomised in cross-over of healthy volunteers from March to July 2016, in Caen university hospital. None of them were obese, smoked or had a chronic lung disease. Healthy volunteers conducted a preoxygenation with fraction of inspired oxygen at 100%: spontaneous ventilation (SV) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV, pressure support +6 cmH 2 O and PEEP +5 cmH 2 O) without and with calibrated leak (SV-leak and NIV-leak). From the volunteer mouth at respirator, subjects breathed through a mouthpiece (with a nose clip), mount catheter, antibacterial filter and Y-piece of respirator. In modes of ventilation with calibrated leaks, the leak was placed on mount catheter. The leak was characterized as a turbulent flow with the flow/pressure curve. The fraction of expired oxygen (FeO 2 ), changes in respiratory rate and end-tidal of carbon dioxide were measured. A PreOx was deemed effective if FeO 2 > 90%. The primary endpoint was the time to achieve a FeO 2 > 90%. The secondary endpoint was the proportion of subject with FeO 2 > 90% at the third minute. Results The study included 20 healthy volunteers. The time to achieve a FeO 2 > 90% was 85 [68-110] s, 78 [69-84] s and 84 [72-110] s in SV group, NIV and NIV-leak, respectively. The SV-leak group never reached a FeO 2 > 90% (p < 0.001). After 3 min, 19 (95%) in SV group, 20 (100%) in NIV group, 19 (95%) in NIV-leak group and 0 (0%) in SV-leak group volunteers had a FeO 2 > 90%. Cox proportional-hazards regression showed that NIV [hazard ratio 2.13; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.09 to 4.18); p = 0.02] was associated with a shorter time to an expired O 2 fraction of 90% than NIV-leak or SV-leak. Discussion In the presence of calibrated leaks, preoxygenation is effective with noninvasive ventilation than spontaneous ventilation.",

In France, since 2006, legislation for pediatric critical care organization approved the establishment of pediatric intermediate care units, between pediatric wards and pediatric intensive care units. In pediatric intermediate units, children require close monitoring and/or continuous monitoring due to potential organ failure, without requiring resuscitation. The aim of this study is to describe patients characteristics of French pediatric intermediate care units. Patients and methods We performed a prospective observational cohort study in pediatric intermediate care units of seven regional hospitals in northern of France. All consecutive patients under 18 years, admitted in these seven pediatric intermediate care units were included (September 2012-January 2014).

A questionnaire was completed for each performed TCD by the intensivist. TCD interpretation and impact were accorded to the intensivist. Factors associated with impact, and especially diagnostic and therapeutic impacts were identified. Results 152 patients were included with a median age of 7.6 months (0-206 months). TCD was performed in 6.7% of all admitted patients during the inclusion period. 61% of patients were aged between 28 days and 2 years. 67% of patients were admitted for a neurological motive. Diagnosis were: neurological (70%), hemodynamic (10%) respiratory (10%), hepatic (7%) and renal (1%), others (2%). TCD was performed for monitoring of neurological disorders in 56% of cases. Intracranial hypertension was the most frequently suspected abnormality, and most often searched by young operators (p < 0.001).Hyperperfusion was most often suspected by experienced intensivists (p < 0.05). Discrepancy between the interpretation of DTC values and published reference values was found in 116 patients (76%). TCD had an impact for 116 patients (76%), with a strong impact (diagnosis' confirmation or exclusion, therapeutic impact) for 98 patients (64%). Confirmation of diagnosis was statistically associated with patients severity: mortality, catecholamines, intubation, PELOD score (p < 0.05). Hemodynamic dysfunction (OR 6.4; p = 0.007) and less experienced operators (OR 3.9; p = 0.012) were independent factors affecting therapeutic impact in multivariate analysis. Discussion This original study is at our best of knowledge the first to describe use of TCD in heterogeneous diseases in critically ill children without traumatic brain injury. TCD was performed not only in patients with neurological disorders, highlighting the wide field of applications of this exam. This study showed the difficulty of TCD interpretation, whose reference values are not well-known by operators. Moreover, TCD values could be biased by several systemic parameters, usually not controlled in these unstable patients. TCD's impact was",

COX-1 and COX-2, and prostaglandins terminal synthesizing enzymes were evaluated using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. Microvascular blood flow indexes (artery diameter, capillaries number) were measured using sidestream dark-field videomicroscopy in PBS-and 7-NI-treated ischemic rats in the absence or presence of the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (5 mg/kg). Cell death was measured with the TUNEL assay and cleaved-caspase-3 immunostaining.Results Six-keto-PGF1\u03b1 and COX-2, associated with a PgE synthase, were significantly increased in PBS-and 7-NI-treated animals 15 min and 1 h after ischemia-reperfusion, respectively. In contrast and as compared to PBS, 7-NI significantly decreased prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) and cytosolic PgE synthase (cPGES) mRNA. Selective COX-2 inhibition significantly decreased BF indexes, and significantly reversed the effects of 7-NI including the number of TUNEL+-and cleaved-caspase-3+-nuclei. See Fig. 25 below.

Psychotropic drugs overdose (43.1%) and pesticides ingestion (25.5%) were the two most common causes of suicide attempts. Eighty-one patients (37.5%) had a psychiatric history. Coma (32.9%) and respiratory distress (22.7%) were the two major reasons for ICU admission. Mechanical ventilation was required for 84 patients (38.9%).

No animal study has investigated neurobehavioral differences in relation to the lithium poisoning pattern observed in humans, while differences in lithium pharmacokinetics have been reported in lithium-pretreated rats mimicking chronic poisonings with enhanced brain accumulation in rats with renal failure. Our objectives were: (1) to investigate lithiumrelated effects in overdose on locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, spatial recognition memory and anhedonia in the rat;(2) to model the relationships between lithium-induced effects on locomotion and plasma, erythrocyte, cerebrospinal fluid and brain concentrations previously obtained according to the poisoning pattern. Materials and methods Open-field, elevated plus-maze, Y-maze and sucrose consumption tests were used. We developed acute (intraperitoneal administration of 185 mg/kg Li 2 CO 3 in naive rats), acute-onchronic (intraperitoneal administration of 185 mg/kg Li 2 CO 3 in rats receiving 800 mg/l Li 2 CO 3 in water during 28 days), and chronic poisoning models (intraperitoneal administration of 74 mg/kg Li 2 CO 3 during 5 days in rats with 15 mg/kg K 2 Cr 2 O 7 -induced renal failure).",

Horizontal (p < 0.01) and vertical (p < 0.001) hypolocomotion peaked more markedly 24 h after lithium injection and was more prolonged in acute-on-chronically versus acutely lithium-poisoned rats. Hypolocomotion in chronically lithium-poisoned rats with impaired renal function did not differ from acutely poisoned rats 24 h after the last injection. Interestingly, hypolocomotion/concentration relationships best fitted a sigmoidal Emax model in acute poisoning and a linear regression model linked to brain lithium in acute-on-chronic poisoning. Conclusion Lithium overdose alters rat behaviour and consistently induces hypolocomotion which is more marked and prolonged in repeatedly lithium-treated rats. Our data suggest that differences between poisoning patterns regarding lithium-induced hypolocomotion are better explained by the duration of lithium exposure than by its brain accumulation.",

Discussion This is the first study to highlight the effect of hospitalization for bronchiolitis on breastfeeding, and to question the various factors involved. Our study is subject to possible bias (single centered, long delay between hospitalisation and questionnaire) but we Introduction The explosion of non invasive ventilation (NIV) and high frequency canula therapy (HFNCT) in bronchiolitis for the last 10 years led to a decreased rate of intubation [1] . There are lacking data concerning the clinical and biological factors associated with severe bronchiolitis defined by the need for an intensive level of NIV or for invasive ventilation (IV). Patients and methods Two hundred and fifty-two patients aged of less than 6 months were included in a retrospective study conducted over a three winter period from 2013 to 2016 in a 16 bed French PICU. We aimed to compare patients hospitalized for severe bronchiolitis, defined by the need for an intensive level of NIV or for invasive ventilation (IV) to non severe patients that were treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) or HFNCT. We secondly analyzed the evolution of patients characteristics over a three winter period and factors associated with HFNCT failure. Clinical and biological factors were recorded at the admission of the patients and 4 h after (H4). Results One hundred patients were included in the non severe bronchiolitis group and 152 in the severe group. Factors significantly associated with severe bronchiolitis were a young age, a small weight and the presence of apneas at the admission. The Wang severity score, the heart rate, the apH and the PaCO 2 were significantly different between the two groups at the admission and at H4. The level of oxygenation at H4 were also higher in the non severe group. The rate of bacterial coinfection, the length of stay in PICU and of ventilation were higher in the severe group. Over the 3 years period, the rate of IV and NIV bilevel positive airway pressure significantly decreased in parallel with the increased utilization of HFNCT. Comparing patients responders or not to HFNCT, the weight, the Wang score, the respiratory rate, the apH and the PaCO 2 at H4 were significantly different. Discussion First, we found that clinical and biological factors associated with the need for a NIV bi level positive airway pressure were similar of those associated with the need for IV previously described [2] . We can hypothesize that patients at risk of severe bronchiolitis and NIV failure are actually better identified with prompt modification of ventilation parameters and a greater tolerance for permissive hypercapnia under NIV support. All of these factors lead to a reduction of the rate of intubation [1] . Secondly, patients hospitalized seemed to be less severe according to biological parameters (apH and PaCO 2 ) and the decreased need for IV all along the three seasons studied. This could be in relation with an earlier recognition of critically illness patients and no delayed respiratory support treatment. This could also be related to an increased administration of HFNCT to patients usually treated with standard oxygen treatment. Finally, we reported factors associated with HFNCT failure. Even if HFNCT is not actually recommended in the first line treatment of bronchiolitis, some authors described its efficiency in this pathology, with similar results as nCPAP and superiority to standard nasal oxygen with reduced respiratory rate, respiratory work, length of stay and level of oxygenation. Conclusion NIV is a useful respiratory support technique in paediatric patients with bronchiolitis. Younger and heavier patients, clinical severity score, respiratory and heart rate or biological parameters like apH and PaCO 2 are factors associated with an intensive level of NIV.",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was present in 16 cases (severe n = 5, mild n = 6, light n = 5). Septic shock and acute renal failure were observed respectively in 5 and 8 cases. Diagnosis was made in all cases by urinary antigen test. Legionella pneumophila was present also in sputum in 5 cases. Mechanical ventilation was needed in 13 cases; it was initially NIV in 46%. Fifteen patients were treated by a combination antibiotherapy: It was macrolide and quinolone in 52% (n = 10), quinolone and rifampicine in 31% (n = 5), the others were treated with macrolide or quinolones in monotheray. Median duration of ventilation was 7 days [2-29 days]. Median length of ICU stay was 13 days. Seven patients were died. Univariate analysis showed that presence of major criteria of ATS score at admission (p = 0.001), severe ARDS (p = 0.004), elevated liver enzymes (p = 0.047), needs of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.024) or intubation (p = 0.00), septic shock (p = 0.001); dialysis (p = 0.020) were associated with a higher mortality. Multivariate analysis showed that independent predictive factors of mortality were ATS major criteria OR 3.5 [95% CI (1.08-11.92)]; mechanical ventilation OR 0.5 [95% CI (0.28-0.88)]; severe ARDS OR 0.117 [95% CI (0.017-0.80)]; septic shock OR 0.09 [95% CI (0.015-0.65)] and need of dialysis OR 0.14 [95% CI (0.02-1.06)]. Conclusion Our study confirms that LD requiring hospitalization in ICU is associated with high morbimortality. Presence of ATS major criteria, severe ARDS, mechanical ventilation, septic shock and dialysis were the major factors for worse prognosis.",

Besides advanced life support and eventual instrumental interventions, the treatment of cancer-related organ failures relies on timely administration of chemotherapy. Published data about requirements of chemotherapy in the ICU are mostly related to patients with haematological malignancies, while reports of patients with solid tumors are scarce. In this study, we addressed the features and outcomes of patients with organ failures directly related to solid neoplasms.",

All adult patients who were admitted to the ICU with organ failures related to solid malignancies and treated with chemotherapy between 2000 and 2015 were enrolled into the study. Data were collected from individual files, and included the overall severity through the SOFA score computed at the time of ICU admission, the type and mechanism of organ failures, and the modalities of chemotherapy administration. Endpoints were the in-ICU and in-hospital vital status. Results 136 patients were included. The most common underlying malignancy was lung cancer (n = 90), distributed between small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (n = 57) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n = 33). Most malignancies were newly diagnosed (n = 122, 89.7%), the diagnosis being made in the ICU for 80 patients (58.9%). The majority of patients (n = 82, 60.3%) had metastasis. The main reason for ICU admission was acute respiratory failure in 111 (81.6%) patients. Compression and tissue infiltration by tumor cells were the leading mechanisms resulting in organ involvement in 78 (57.4%) and 47 (34.6%) patients. Other indications for ICU admission relied on paraneoplastic manifestations in 11 cases. The treatment was based on combined and single chemotherapy in 120 (88.2%) and 16 (11.8%) patients, respectively. The dosing was reduced in 20 patients (20%) mostly linked to renal failure, and the sequence of drug administration was modified in 18 patients (18%). Thirty-four patients (25%) required either instrumental or surgical adjuvant procedures. Eighty-nine patients received invasive mechanical ventilation with duration of 13 (5-25) days, 39 patients required vasopressors (28.7%) and 11 required renal replacement therapy (8.1%). The overall in-ICU, in-hospital, 6-month and 1-year mortality rates were 37, 58, 74 and 88%, respectively. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, SCLC was identified as an independent predictor of hospital survival. However this gain in survival was not sustained since the 1-year survival rates of SCLC, NSCLC and non-lung cancer patients all dropped below 20%. Discussion The prognosis of solid neoplasm-related organ failures relies on multidisciplinary management involving both intensivists and oncologists. Appropriate management of cytostatic drugs is paramount to improve their efficacy on tumor cells while minimizing their toxicity. Dosing of chemotherapy in critically ill patients represents a still unexplored area of research owing to a number of factors that may result in drug underdosing or overdosing. Conclusion Acute respiratory failure related to lung cancer represents the main indication for urgent administration of chemotherapy in the ICU. Urgent chemotherapy along with aggressive management of organ failures in the ICU can be life-saving in a number of cancer patients, most especially for SCLC, although the long-term survival is hardly sustainable.",

            "text": "Lung ultrasound for early diagnosis of pneumonia after cardiac surgery Pauline Dureau 1 , Adrien Bougl\u00e9 2 , Audrey Tanguy Introduction Pneumonia is a frequent and severe complication of major cardiac surgery, contributing to postoperative morbidity and death [1] . Diagnosis of pneumonia remains a challenge in ventilated patients, notably after cardiac surgery, and the diagnostic performance of Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) remains controversial. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has been successfully used for the diagnosis and the management of community acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [2] , but LUS usefulness and reliability was never investigated in the specific ICU patients after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This pilot observational study investigated the clinical relevance of lung ultrasonography (LUS) for diagnosis of pneumonia in cardiac postoperative patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Patients and methods Adult patients were prospectively enrolled from January through May 2015 in presence of acute respiratory failure (ARF) less than 3 days after a cardiac surgery with CPB. Lung ultrasound examination was performed as follows: subpleural consolidation, lobar consolidation, dynamic and static air bronchogram, and intrapulmonary shunt. We compared this ultrasound approach to the post hoc diagnosis of pneumonia established from clinical, radiologic, and biologic data by three blinded experts. Then, we compared the diagnostic performances of CPIS, ultrasound criteria and a lung ultrasound based CPIS, LUS-CPIS, with or without radiology criteria. The study was approved by the Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes Ile de France III; IRB 2015-A00127-42 R\u00e9f. S.C. 3275. Results Fifty-one patients (age 65 \u00b1 12 years, male sex 72.6%) with ARF were included in the study, and pneumonia was diagnosed in 26 of them. No difference was observed between patients with or without pneumonia among demographic data, type of surgery, CPB length. In case of pneumonia, the most frequently identified pathogens were Enterobacteriaceae (37%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%) and Haemophilus influenza (8%). Multivaried analysis showed that intrapulmonary shunt was the best predictive criteria of pneumonia (odds-ratio 1 (Fig. 30) . Furthermore, our results suggest the use of ultrasound data may consistently reduce misuse of antibiotics of 70%. Discussion A new score, combination of simplified CPIS and a simple ultrasound parameter, intra-pulmonary shunt, predicts efficiently the presence of pneumonia after cardiac surgery with CPB. Two LUS parameters, presence of a shunt and a bronchogram aeric within a consolidation, are crucial for discerning pneumonia from another etiology. This approach has the advantage to make an early diagnosis of pneumonia in ARF patients with an inexpensive, non-invasive and convenient at bedside technology. Conclusion This prospective observational study is the first one showing that LUS combined with a clinical score can be a reliable tool for early diagnosis of pneumonia in a cardiac ICU population after cardiac surgery with CPB.",

Intensive Care 2017, 7(Suppl 1):8 HDD: patient characteristics and comorbidities, ICU hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, occurrence of death. Results On the study period, the number of hospitalization for ARI has almost doubled: from 6751 cases in 2006 to 11,744 cases in 2012, and 10,167 cases in 2014. The incidence of ARI increased in all age class but was more important for patient over 85 y-o. Among these hospitalized patients, 740 were hospitalized in ICU in 2006 and nearly 2000 in 2014. Importantly, the rate of ICU-hospitalization among hospitalized patients for ARI increased on the study period: 11% in 2006 whereas it was superior to 17% since 2010. This trend for increase ICU admission was proportional with aging: 2-fold increase at 75-79 y-o, 2.5-fold increase at 80-84 y-o, threefold increase at 85-90 y-o, and 4.5-fold increase for patient over 90 y-o. The overall hospital-mortality was relatively stable and varied between 6.7 and 9% for non-ICU patients and 14.4-17.2% in ICUpatients. Regarding patients over 90 y-o hospitalized in ICU, the mortality has been drastically reduced: from 40.9 to 22.2% on the study period. Discussion This large prospective study provides a contemporary view of elderly with severe ARI admitted to ICUs. We found significant increase in elderly patient with a primary diagnosis of ARI hospitalized in ICU. We highlighted that ARI is an increasing reason for death among ICU-hospitalized patient and still a major public health problem. Interestingly, our results are consistent with longitudinal changes in ICU admission also observed in this study period in the United States. Conclusion We found substantial increase of ARI diagnoses leading to hospitalization between 2006 and 2014 with a growing demand for critical care service. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of intensive care hospitalization for the very elderly patients. We cannot arbitrary reject the very elderly from the doors of the ICU-it is ageism-but we need information to select more accurately the patients with the highest probability of survival, and to avoid useless and aggressive cares when it is not appropriate.",

The measurement of intracranial pressure is the reference method. Due to infectious and hemorrhagic risks, other non-invasive techniques have been developed such as the transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCDS) and the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). The aim of our study was to compare TCCDS data to the ONSD measurements and to CT scanning data in predicting intracranial hypertension. Patients and methods Prospective study enrolling all patients admitted to our ICU for severe traumatic brain injury between February and August 2016. The intracranial hypertension was studied by CT scanning, TCCDS and ocular ultrasonography. CT defines intracranial hypertension by a midline shift >5 mm, collapsed third ventricle, presence of hydrocephalus and erased basal cisterns with significant edema. TTCDS identifies a significant intracranial hypertension by a pulsatile index (PI) >1.2 and a diastolic velocity <20 cm/s. An ONSD > 5 mm is considered abnormal. The study of associations was done using non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon and Fisher) and data analysis was performed by epi-info software. Results Sixty patients with severe traumatic brain injury were included in the study. The average age was 42 \u00b1 17 years. The sex-ratio was 1.4. The intracranial hypertension was diagnosed by pupillary abnormalities in 36% of cases, CT scanning in 84% of cases, TTCDS in 68% of cases and ONSD in 69% of cases. There was no significant correlation between an ONSD > 5 mm and CT scanning findings (p = 0.58) nor with TCCDS (p = 0.08) in predicting intracranial hypertension. Conclusion ONSD is a quick and simple method that has been widely proven to predict intracranial hypertension. A larger sample is needed to confirm our results.",

The objective of our study is to determine the epidemiological aspects and to identify factors correlated with shortand long-term prognosis. Patients and methods It was a retrospective study during 4 years (January 2009-December 2012) included 694 patients with traumatic brain injury due to traffic accidents. We studied the factors correlated with poor prognosis in terms of death or Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) in univariate and multivariate analysis. For study according to GOS, patients (n = 694) were divided in two groups: favorable GOS for patients having a good recovery or recovery with a minor handicap [GOS class 4 or5] and unfavorable GOS for patients having a severe handicap or vegetative state [GOS class 1or 2] or died [GOS1] . Results During the study period, 694 patients (18.7% of all patients) were admitted to our ICU with traumatic brain injury due to traffic accidents. The mean of age was 31.9. The sex ratio was 5.8. In admission, 20% of patients had hypotension, 17.4% of patients had respiratory distress and the mean GSC was 8.8. The mortality rate was 28.5%. 496 patients were survivor: 13 patients with vegetative state, 133 with severe handicap (19.3%), 185 patients with minor handicap (26.7%), and 163 patients with good recovery (23.6%). The predictive independent factors correlated to mortality in multivariate analysis were: age \u226538, hypotension, hypoxemia, SGS \u2264 8, unilateral or bilateral mydriasis, cerebral edema, Marshall Class VI, initial hemoglobin \u226411.3, Blood sugar \u22658.3 mmol/l. The predictive factors correlated with poor prognosis according GOS were: age \u226538, initial shock, SGC \u2264 8, unilateral or bilateral mydriasis, post traumatic coma duration more than 5 days, cerebral edema, initial hemoglobin \u226411.7 g/dl, blood sugar \u22658.4 mmol/l and catecholamine using. Conclusion The short-term prognosis of head trauma seems recently stabilized even for the most serious patients, but the distant consequences of head trauma are fairly frequent, heavy and often undervalued. That is why, it is so important to identify these consequences and management them correctly.",

Depending on the type of injury, mortality raises from 4 to 60%. There are no surgical guidelines concerning rib fracture except for flail chest needing mechanical ventilation. No trial has yet assessed the global benefit of both surgical and medical treatment. The primary endpoint was to determine wether rib fixation on the one hand and epidural analgesia on the other hand reduces pneumonia. The secondary endpoints were to show a decrease of mechanical ventilation duration and lengths of stay in intensive care and hospital. Materials and methods We performed a pre/post osteosynthesis study. We determined two groups. From 01/2011 to 08/2014, all patients admitted for chest trauma were screened by a thoracic surgeon in order to select those with a rib fixation indication. They formed the historical cohort: \u00abnot fixed\u00bb. From 08/2014 to 08/2016, all patients with chest trauma and rib fixation were included. They formed the group \u00abfixed\u00bb. Were excluded patients who died within the first 48 h.The surgical treatment is defined by a rib fixation. The medical treatment is defined by epidural analgesia and noninvasive ventilation. Results One hundred and twelve patients with equivalent surgical indication of rib fixation were enrolled from January 2011 to August 2016. Fifty-seven patients were not fixed and 55 patients were fixed. Eighty-two (73%) were men of 57 (20-86) years old. The mean ISS was 22 (4-66). The mean SAPS II was 25 (6-86). Eighty-five patients (80%) were hospitalized in Intensive care. 72 patients (64%) had an epidural analgesia. Fifty percent of the patients were operated on within the first 24 h. Thirty-three patients suffered from pneumonia that occurred on average on the fifth (2-10) day. Epidural analgesia significantly decreased the incidence of pneumonia (p < 0.001). Rib fixation had no impact on the incidence of pneumonia (p = 0.1). Both length of stay in hospital and in intensive care were neither reduced by epidural analgesia nor by rib fixation. Epidural analgesia reduced mechanical ventilation duration. Rib fixation didn't reduce mechanical ventilation duration. Conclusion It is the first study to assess the importance of both medical and surgical care of chest trauma. Epidural analgesia is effective in decreasing incidence of pneumonia whatever the rib fixation.",

So, initial care of severely burned patients requires participation of all physians in every discipline and in every hospital. The goal of this study was to examine characteristics of burn patients acutely transferred to our intensive burn care unit and to assess their prognosis. Patients and methods A prospective study was conducted in intensive burn care center in Tunis. All consecutive adult burned patients acutely transferred to our burn center, from January 1st to September 23st, 2016 were included in the study. Demograhic, clinical and biological data of patients were recorded.Results During the 9 month study period, 190 patients were admitted among which 101 patients were acutely transferred from other hospitals (53%). The mean age was 37 \u00b1 15 years. The mean surface burned area announced was 44 \u00b1 22 versus 36 \u00b1 22% reevaluated at admission. Patients were transferred with a delay of 40 H after burns [H1-H264]. Burn injuries were caused by domestic accidents in 42%, self immolation in 26% and work related burns in 14%. Transfer with medical agreement was noted in 57% of cases. At admission, 12% of patients had burn shock and 43% had endotracheal intubation. A central venous cathter was placed in 51% of cases, nasogastric tubes in 11% and urinary devices in 55% of cases. Dressing were performed in 66% of cases. Fluid resuscitation was initiated in 74% of cases with crystalloid: Ringer lactate (42%) and/or normal saline (19%). Initial lactate of patients was 3.36 \u00b1 1.7 mmol [1-8.8] with pH at 7.33 [6.6-7.51 ] and bicarbonates at 20 \u00b1 5 [9-34]. We noted that patients transferred without medical agreement had more burn shock (16.2 vs 8.6%) and a higher mortality (25.5 vs 17.2%).
