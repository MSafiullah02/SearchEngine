Furthermore, Zn has been shown to exert direct inhibitory effects against a variety of viruses including human rhinovirus (Korant and Butterworth, 1976, Geist et al., 1987) herpes simplex virus (K\u00fcmel et al., 1990, Arens and Travis, 2000), human immunodeficiency virus (Haraguchi et al., 1999), hepatitis C virus (Yuasa et al., 2006), respiratory syncytial virus (Suara and Crowe, 2004), and vaccinia virus (Katz and Margalith, 1981). In swine nutrition the use of high levels of dietary Zn applied as ZnO was shown to reduce the incidence and severity of unspecific diarrhea after weaning (Zhang and Guo, 2009). However, specific effects of Zn treatment against viral diarrhea in swine have not yet been addressed.",

TGEV causes symptoms of gastroenteritis in swine, a condition associated with high morbidity in animals of all ages and high mortality in suckling piglets (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2002, Chen et al., 2004). The appearance of a porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which is antigenically related to TGEV, has strongly decreased the risk of TGE in Europe, since neutralizing antibodies elicited by PRCV can provide cross-protection against TGEV infection. However, TGEV prevalence is still reported in different parts of the world, implying that TGEV is still threatening pig industry. As no safe and fully protective TGEV vaccine exists, an effective treatment of the disease in piglets is needed (Ren et al., 2011).",

When added at an early stage of infection (1\u20134 hpi), Zn might partly block or delay the initial cell entry of TGEV, which is mediated through receptor mediated endocytosis and acid dependent fusion (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2002). The same could be valid for the entry of newly produced virus, when Zn is added in a later stage of infection (22\u201324 hpi) after multiple replication cycles. Additionally or alternatively, Zn could also impair stages of viral replication that follow the release of TGEV into the cytoplasm. A possible intracellular target for Zn-mediated inhibition is the viral RNA polymerase which was reportedly inhibited by increasing intracellular Zn ions in case of the SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other viruses (te Velthuis et al., 2010). In our study, the relative amount of viral S-protein RNA detectable in infected cells was significantly reduced by Zn treatment for 1\u20134 hpi without previous inhibition of virus penetration as shown in Fig. 2\n. In case of ZnCl2 treatment, the reduction was more than 40-fold and in case of ZnSO4 it was more than 16-fold compared to the viral RNA levels in the untreated wells. We also found the relative amount of viral proteins released from infected cells to be reduced by more than 40% for the early-stage treatment without previous inhibition of virus penetration (Fig. 3\n). This reduction of viral proteins could be a result of the inhibition of previous stages of viral replication, but again there is also evidence that Zn could directly inhibit the proteolytic cleavage of viral polypeptides (Korant and Butterworth, 1976). Potential points of action against TGEV might be a chymotrypsin-like protease that is responsible for the cleavage of polyproteins into functional proteins, and which is highly conserved in coronaviruses (Kuo et al., 2009), or a papain-like protease which, in case of the SARS-CoV, was shown to be potently inhibited by Zn ions (Han et al., 2005).",

The mean virus titer in the mock-treated wells was 107.3\n TCID50/ml (SEM = 0.28 log10\n TCID50/ml) compared to 104.9 (SEM = 0.43 log10\n TCID50/ml) for ZnCl2 at 200 \u03bcM (P\n < 0.05), and 105.5 (SEM = 0.43 log10\n TCID50/ml) for ZnSO4 at 200 \u03bcM (P\n < 0.05). In case of ZnCl2 treatment this parallels a more than 250-fold reduction and in case of ZnSO4 a more than 60-fold reduction. Presumably the repeated inhibition of one or more viral replication steps could potentiate the antiviral effects of Zn treatment. The observation that the virus yield reduction achieved with the long-term treatment did not reach the potential amount of the combined early and late short-term treatment, however, might be explained by the fact that the long-term treatment was initiated without prior inhibition of initial virus penetration as is was the case with the early short-term treatment (1\u20134 hpi), so that this initial reduction is missing.",
