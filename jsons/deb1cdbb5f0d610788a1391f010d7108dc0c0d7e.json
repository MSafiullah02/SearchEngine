            "text": "Doctors and laboratory technologists use radioactive materials for medical diagnosis and therapy. These materials are also used for the sterilization of medical products, 1 power production and other industrial purposes. The most critical issue 1 Radioactive material produce radiation to sterilize health care products including surgical gloves, syringes, catheters and bandagers. It is reported that about 200 radiation sterilization facilities operate in more than 50 countries and around 45% of all medical disposables are sterilized using radiation. See Arumugam Nagarajan Nandakumar, Cargo Controversy . . . in this regard is that radio isotopes 2 which have short life spans need to be transported to patients preferably by air. The problem arises when the air carrier refuses to carry such radioactive medical supplies. 3 It is reported that 60% of such denials relate to air transport and 30% to maritime transport. 4 Radio active cargo, or class 7 materials 5 as they are defined technically, are carried by means of transport (whether by air, sea or rail/road transport) in accordance with national and international regulations. The latter are regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 6 According to the IAEA, refusal to carry such cargo include the following reasons: l Apprehension and negative perception on the part of carriers and public authorities about radiation. This is due, in part, to lack of information; l Concerns about extent and costs of training. The reason for this apprehension is the belief on the part of carriers that extensive training has to be given to those involved in transportation of goods if they are to handle radioactive cargo. The IAEA confirms that this concern is unjustified as all concerned with handling cargo are expected to be given a training session which lasts only for half a day; l Multiplicity of authorities regulating the carriage of radioactive cargo and the numerous regulations promulgated nationally; l The absence of awareness of the compelling need to transport radioactive medicines and the adequacy of the safety standards in practice; and l Apprehension of the costs of insurance in the event of accidents. 7 2 A radionuclide is an atom with an unstable nucleus. The radionuclide undergoes radioactive decay by emitting a gamma ray(s) and/or subatomic particles. Radionuclides may occur naturally, but can also be artificially produced. Radionuclides are often referred to by chemists and biologists as radioactive isotopes or radioisotopes, and play an important part in the technologies that provide us with food, water and good health. However, they can also constitute real or perceived dangers. 3 IAEA reports that denials are occurring all parts of the world. It is reported that airlines such as British Airways and KLM ban radioactive material while Northwest Airlines bans shipments on al its passenger planes. Several Asian airlines are also reported to opt out of carriage of radioactive material. See Miller (2004) additionally listed generic reasons for denial as requirements imposed on competent authorities both within and between countries; requirements for a carrier or port handlers radiation protection programme; travel through \"nuclear free zones\" that capture non-nuclear material; port docking prohibitions of vessels containing class 7 material; and some ports not permitting transhipment of Class 7 cargo though permitting entrance of materials for use in their own countries.",

            "text": "The IAEA also records that, over the past 50 years, there has been no substantial risk from the transport of radioactive material. 8 The IAEA General Conference in 2003 convened on 19 September 2003 adopted Resolution which called for discussions to address the problems associated with refusal of shipments. 9 The Conference requested IAEA to develop an Action Plan, based on the results of the Conference. The Action Plan for the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material, approved by the Board of Governors in March 2004, called upon the Secretariat inter alia to establish a fact finding discussion forum addressing the concerns of relevant entities which may include IMO, ICAO, IATA 10 and IFALPA and WCO. 11 At a meeting held in May 2006 at the IAEA Headquarters on the subject of denial of shipments of radioactive material, it was recognized that a third of marine carriers do not transport class 7 cargo. Those carriers who accepted such cargo would either carry the cargo to their own States or require an indemnity from the State concerned. The meeting also noted that although there was a Resolution of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) requiring ships to carry class 7 cargo, air carriers could not be forced to do so. The International Civil Aviation Organization said for the record that air carriers could only be persuaded to carry class 7 cargo, and not forced to do so. 12 The meeting also recognized that although pilots in command were the major protagonists in refusing carriage of radioactive medicines, they were only a small part of responsibility of the pilot and the pilot had to give written reasons as to why the carriage of such goods was refused. 13 It must be noted that, at a meeting of the IAEA held in September 2005, the International 8 Id. 3. 9 GC(47)/RES/7.C/. 10 The International Air Transport Association, an association of air carriers, was formed in 1919 as the International Air Traffic Association. Encapsulated in IATA's overall mission are seven core objectives: to promote safe, reliable and secure air services; to achieve recognition of the importance of a healthy air transport industry to worldwide social and economic development; to assist the air transport industry in achieving adequate levels of profitability; to provide high quality, value for money, industry-required products and services that meet the needs of the customer; to develop cost effective, environmentally-friendly standards and procedures to facilitate the operation of international air transport; to identify and articulate common industry positions and support the resolution of key industry issues; and to provide a working environment which attracts, retains and develops committed employees. 11 The World Customs Organization (WCO) is an inter governmental organization that helps Members (currently Customs administrations from 169 countries) communicate and co-operate on customs issues. It was established in 1952 as the Customs Co-operation Council; it adopted its current name in 1994. Headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, it develops agreed rules on customs procedures and provides advice and assistance to customs services. It has established an international standard classification of commodities called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System which is used to classify goods for tariff purposes the application of tariffs. The WCO has 169 members. Federation of Airline Pilots' Associations (IFALPA) submitted a paper which recognized that there has been an increase in recent years of the number of denials of shipments of radioactive materials by airlines, airports, pilots and States and that such denials are capable of posing problems for hospitals, patients and suppliers of radio pharmaceuticals. The IFALPA Dangerous Goods Committee supported the transport of all classes of dangerous goods, including class 7 material as long as the transport complied with the provisions of Annex 18 to the Chicago Convention on the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Air and associated Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods. IFALPA emphasized the fact that in consideration of whether a denial is appropriate or not, it was clear that safety is always the overriding factor and that other issues never have priority. 14 The May 2006 meeting of IAEA was followed by a second meeting in Vienna from 14 to 16 November 2006 where an international steering committee on denial of shipment was established. 15 The meeting recorded IAEA's concern about the denial and delay involved in the carriage of radioactive material. This concern is personified in a resolution adopted by IAEA during its ninth plenary meeting on 30 September 2005, welcomed inter alia the progress made in conjunction with IFALPA on the problems related to refusals of shipments of radioactive materials (in particular for medical applications) and looked forward to a satisfactory resolution of the issue, while encouraging the IAEA Secretariat to continue addressing the denial of shipping issue. 16 The ICAO Dangerous Goods Panel, at its meeting of the Working Group of the Whole convened at Abu Dhabi from 4 to 8 October 2004 recognized that the IAEA believed that the problem of denial of radioactive medicines on board aircraft was linked to public perception and training rather than to a lack of safety 17 14 IFALPA, The Global Voice of Pilots, July 2005, reproduced in International Steering Committee on Denials of Shipments of Radioactive Material, TM-33059 (IAEA), Information Paper No. 05., Rev. 0. The Working Group of the ICAO Dangerous Goods Panel has also recognized that medical isotopes were beneficial to the delivery of healthcare and due to the time sensitive nature of the products the air mode is fundamental to ensuring such products can be used upon delivery to a health facility. Consequently, widespread denials of such shipments were not in the public interest. See Report of the Meeting of the Working Group of the Whole WG/04, DGP-WG/05-WP/1 7.2.2 at p. 16. 15 The mandate of the steering committee is to develop an action plan to prevent cases of denials of shipments and to alleviate the hardships to users of radioactive material that have been denied or delayed; determine the milestones in the implementation of the action plan; identify the specific role that could be played by each Member of the Committee and; recommend a mechanism for monitoring progress. See IAEA TM 33059, Working Paper No. 02, Rev.1 at 1. The Working Group was of the view that since the issue was related to public and political opinion, a start should be made with developing more public outreach and providing more background on the safety of such shipments. 18 The Working Group also noted that ICAO has been requested by IAEA to communicate with IFALPA to clarify to its members the correct separation rules for transport of radioactive material, animals, passengers and crews; to support the inter-agency meetings since they are a beneficial forum to discuss issues such as denials of shipments and request that they be promoted; support the shortened training plan of IAEA and make it widely available and support the communication resource to be made available by IAEA and make it widely available. 19",

On another aviation platform, Giovanni Bisignani, Director General and CEO of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) stressed at its Annual General Meeting held in Vancouver from 3 to 5 June 2007 that the industry has changed tremendously in 5 years since 9/11. Six years after the tragic events of 2001, air travel is much more secure but there are unlimited ways to attack the aircraft integrity. He added that there is no perfect security system and terrorists change tactics and weapons. Bisignani rightly pointed out that terrorists are studying what measures the industry is adopting; and that all the air industry can do is make the system strong enough to constitute sufficient deterrent and make aircraft a harder target to hit.",

            "text": "The leakage of dangerous pathogens 20 from laboratories presents an ominous analogy to the aviation sector in that the same could well occur in the carriage of such dangerous goods by air. Although past instances of escaping dangerous pathogens are small in number, nonetheless their occurrence and the threat posed to the wellbeing of humanity cannot be underestimated. In 2002 when Anthrax spores escaped from two military laboratories in the United States, the authorities agreed that the leakage was due to a security lapse. 21 In 2003 a string of such leakages occurred in Asia, this time of the SARS virus. 22 It is now known that the laboratory is not the only place where security lapses could occur. Modern exigencies require samples of deadly pathogens to be transported regularly over vast distances to reach researchers across the world. This calls for a delicate balance between recognizing the compelling need for scientists to exchange and collectively use different strains in order to identify naturally occurring diseases and mutations on the one hand and ensuring that the transport of these infectious substances 23 are carried out according to United Nations Model Regulations 24 on the other. These model regulations are the base upon which specific provisions for the carriage by air are formulated in the packing of samples of infectious pathogens for transportation by air. The shipment of infectious agents or diagnostic specimens by air must comply with local, national and international regulations. International air transport regulations are contained in various documentation of the International Civil Aviation Organization and Dangerous Goods Regulations-an annual publication of the International Air Transport Association 20 Pathogens are microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsia, parasites, fungi) or recombinant microorganisms (hybrid or mutant) that are known or are reasonably expected to cause infectious disease in humans or animals. 21 An year earlier, a covert event occurred in October 2001 when anthrax spores were sent through the mail exposing persons in the eastern USA to contaminated mail resulting in deaths, illnesses and identified exposures to Anthrax. Overt, announced events, in which persons are warned that an exposure has occurred, have taken place in the United States, although most of these were determined to have been hoaxes, that is, there were no true exposures to infectious agents. 22 The leakages occurred in China, Taiwan and Singapore. See Air-Tight Security, Intersec, June 2007 33-35 at 34. 23 Infectious substances are defined as substances known to contain, or reasonably expected to contain, pathogens. 24 The United Nations has developed recommendations on model regulations for the transport of dangerous goods which recognize that various chemical combinations and mixtures have different requirements in packing for the purpose of transport. See Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Model Regulations, Volume 1, Fourteenth Revised Edition: 2005, Chapter 2.6. p. 113-114. Furthermore, the United Nations Model regulations contain packing instructions for primary, secondary and outer packaging of hazardous goods. See Model Regulations Id. Volume 11, Instruction P620 at p. 70 . Specimens (human, animal, food, environmental, etc.) known or reasonably expected to contain pathogens are now to be classified as infectious substances. When these specimens are transported/shipped for any purpose, including initial or confirmatory testing for the presence of pathogens, they are to be packaged and shipped as infectious substances. published in January, and usually revised on an yearly basis.

In 1999, the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Biomedical Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance). RODS is designed to draw collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other similar systems, collect data from sources including clinical data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales.

The attack caused about 751 people to get sick (there were no fatalities). This incident was the first known bioterrorist attack in the United States in the twentieth century. In September and October of 2001, several cases of anthrax broke out in the United States which were reportedly caused deliberately. This was a well-publicized act of bioterrorism. It motivated efforts to define biodefense and biosecurity. 29 In 1915 and 1916, Dr. Anton Dilger, a German-American physician used cultures of anthrax and glanders with the intention of committing biological sabotage on behalf of the German government. Other German agents are known to have undertaken similar sabotage efforts during World War I in Norway, Spain, Romania and Argentina. 30 Handbook of Bio surveillance, Michael Wagner, Andrew Moore and Ron Aryel, ed.

Health-related data such as those collected from hospital computer systems, clinical laboratories, electronic health record systems, medical examiner record-keeping systems, 911 call center computers, and veterinary medical record systems could be of help in the fight against bioterrorism. Researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by ranching and feedlot operations, food processors, drinking water systems, school attendance recording, and physiologic monitors, among others. Intuitively, one would expect systems which collect more than one type of data to be more useful than systems which collect only one type of information (such as single-purpose laboratory or 911 call-center based systems), and be less prone to false alarms.

See Special Sub Committee on the Preparation of One or More Instruments Addressing New and Emerging Threats, Introductory Note, LC/SC-NET-WP/1, 29/05/07 at p. 2. 33 Proposal to Prohibit the International and Unlawful Transport by Air of Particularly Dangerous Goods and Fugitives, LC/SC-NET-WP/3, 5/07/07. 34 The Preamble to the Chicago Convention recognizes that the future development of international civil aviation can greatly help to create and preserve friendship and understanding among the nations and peoples of the world, and yet its abuse can become a threat to the general security. It also states that it is desirable to avoid friction and to promote co-operation between nations and peoples upon which the peace of the world depends. In pursuance of these objectives, governments signed the Convention that contains certain principles and arrangements in order that international civil aviation may be developed in a safe and orderly manner and that international air transport services may be established on the basis of equality of opportunity and operated soundly and economically. 35 Supra, note 30 in this chapter at p. 1-2. For the purposes of transport, infectious substances are defined as substances which are known or are reasonably expected to contain pathogens. Pathogens are defined as microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsiae, parasites, fungi) and other agents such as prions, which can cause disease in humans or animals. The definition is applied to all specimens except those explicitly excluded in the WHO Guidance Material. 2005 . 38 The WHO regulations categorically state that The Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by are the legally binding international regulations. 39 IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) that incorporate the ICAO provisions and may add further restrictions (where necessary such restrictions are included in these guidelines). The ICAO rules apply on all international flights. For national flights, i.e. flights within one country, national civil aviation authorities apply national legislation. This is normally based on the ICAO provisions, but may incorporate variations. State and operator variations are published in the ICAO Technical Instructions and in the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. The WHO guidelines also contain detailed packing instructions regarding infectious substances. 40 With regard to legal issues, there appear to be some options available to ICAO and its member States to seek a way forward in tightening security with regard to the carriage by air of infectious substances. One legal option would be to include a Standard in Annex 17 on Aviation Security. pertaining to the spread of communicable diseases through acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. Such a provision could require that States take all necessary measures both already established at international law and adopted as national measures within States to ensure that there is no room for the possibility of unlawful carriage of infectious pathogens within and out of their territories. A cross reference and Standard could also be made covering the safety aspects of the threat of bioterrorism. The terrorist attacks in the USA on 11 September 2001 and, more specifically, the subsequent \"anthrax\" scare, brought to the world's attention the threat of deliberate attacks through the use of biological, chemical or nuclear agents. In the event of a bio-terrorist attack the public health response is critical in identifying the nature of the attack and the appropriate response. Therefore a concomitant Standard would have to be introduced in Annex 9 (Facilitation) that would supplement the security Standard by requiring States to ensure that civil protection measures are in place to deal with 38 The international regulations for the transport of infectious substances by any mode of transport are based upon the Recommendations made by the Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UNCETDG), a committee of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The Recommendations are presented in the form of Model Regulations. The United Nations Model Regulations are reflected in international law through international modal agreements. 39 Supra, note 36 in this chapter at p. 2. 40 The system of packaging is recommended for use all infectious substances. It consists of three layers as follows: Primary receptacle-which is a primary watertight, leak-proof receptacle containing the specimen. The receptacle is packaged with enough absorbent material to absorb all fluid in case of breakage. Secondary packaging-which is a second durable, watertight, leakproof packaging to enclose and protect the primary receptacle(s). Several cushioned primary receptacles may be placed in one secondary packaging, but sufficient additional absorbent material shall be used to absorb all fluid in case of breakage. Outer packaging-which are secondary packagings placed in outer shipping packagings with suitable cushioning material. Outer packagings protect their contents from outside influences, such as physical damage, while in transit. The smallest overall external dimension shall be 10 \u00c2 10 cm. Each completed package is normally required to be marked, labelled and accompanied with appropriate shipping documents (as applicable). Supra, note 19 in Chap. 1 at p. 6. these needs.

This Resolution exemplifies the continuing threat to aviation posed by potential security lapses which has permeated the air transport industry for several decades. New and emerging threats to aviation security are therefore not relegated to the post 9/11 era alone.",

In this regard Annex 17 contains extracts from Annex 18 (The Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air) which require each Contracting State to take necessary measures to achieve compliance with the detailed provisions contained in the Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air (Doc 9284), which are approved and issued periodically in accordance with procedure established by the ICAO Council. The requirement also covers compliance with any amendment to the Technical Instructions. 43 Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention also contains some general provisions that may apply to the illegal carriage by air of infectious pathogens. Standard 5.1.2 devolves responsibility upon Contracting States to ensure that, when reliable information exists that an aircraft may be subject to an act of unlawful interference, that the aircraft is searched for illegal weapons, explosives and other dangerous devices.

The Annex draws the attention of the States to the need to adhere to Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air 44 developed by ICAO, according to which packaging used for the transportation of dangerous goods by air shall be of good quality and shall be constructed and securely closed so as to prevent leakage 45 and labelled with the appropriate labels. 46 Annex 18 clearly identifies in Chapter 8 requirements that the carrier has to comply with when accepting dangerous goods for transport. According to these requirements the operator has to ensure that dangerous goods are accompanied by a completed dangerous goods transport document, except when the Technical Instructions indicate that such a document is not required. 47 The carrier is also required not to accept dangerous goods until the package, overpack or freight container containing the dangerous goods has been inspected in accordance with acceptance procedures contained in the Technical Instructions. 46 Id.

The provisions contained therein prescribe the detailed requirements applicable to the international civil transport of dangerous goods by air 51 The overarching principle of the Instructions is that any substance which, as presented for transport, is liable to explode, dangerously react, produce a flame or dangerous emission of heat or toxic, corrosive or flammable gases or vapours under conditions normally encountered in transport must not be carried in aircraft under any circumstances. 52 Infectious substances, which come under Division 6.2 of the Instructions, are defined as substances which are known to contain, or are reasonably expected to contain pathogens. 53 Biological products are considered to be those products derived from living organisms which are manufactured and distributed in accordance with the requirements of the appropriate national authorities, which may have special licensing requirements, and are used either for prevention, treatment or diagnosis of disease in humans or animals, or for developmental or experimental or investigative purposes related thereto. They include, but are not limited to finished and unfinished products such as vaccines. 54 General packing instructions relating to infectious substances are contained in Part 4 of Chapter 1 of the Instructions as well as in the Supplement to the Instructions 55 which, in Chapter 8 provide detailed instructions. The Instructions, which are considered the regulatory baseline for the carriage of dangerous goods, contain comprehensive and clear requirements; which, inter alia provide a structured classification of dangerous goods and list them systematically. The list identifies those goods which are: (a) forbidden under any circumstances; (b) forbidden on both passenger and cargo aircraft in normal circumstances but could be carried in exceptional circumstances subject to exemption by the States concerned; (c) forbidden on passenger aircraft but permitted on cargo aircraft in normal circumstances; and (d) permitted on both passenger and cargo aircraft in normal circumstances. The Instructions require that all dangerous goods be packaged according to specifications provided and, in general, restrict the quantity per package according to the degree of hazard and the type of aircraft (i.e. passenger or cargo) to be used. There is generally no restriction on the number of packages per aircraft. They also identify and set out the packing methods to be used and the packaging permitted, together with the specifications for those packaging and the stringent testing process they must successfully complete before they are able to be used. Requirements for the markings and labels for packages and the documentation for consignments are also set out.",

Under this harmonization the Categories A and B defining infectious substances are similar to those identified in the listings in both the ICAO and IATA Regulations. In Category A, the Packing, marking and labelling is required to be as per IATA Packing Instruction 602 and UN Instruction 2900. As for specifications on packaging, marking and labelling in Category B, they are brought in harmony with IATA Packaging Instruction 650 and UN instruction 3373. 68 Interest in the transport of dangerous in the European Union was sparked by a debate in the European Parliament in 1984. 69 The outcome of the debate is well reflected in the view of the European Commission which followed, that while accidents involving vehicles carrying dangerous gods can have potentially disastrous consequences, it would be counterproductive to duplicate the vastly complex work already being carried out by international organizations. 70 A Study, released in April 2005 suggested that there should be better coordination within the European Commission concerning dangerous goods regulations. This Study makes mention of ICAO and IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations and implicitly recognizes their primacy and applicability in the EU context. 71 This notwithstanding, The European Commission has, since 11 September 2001, launched a comprehensive anti bio-terrorism programme. the Commission has promoted discussions on preparedness for bioterrorist threats. Health ministers have met several times to discuss EU-wide co-ordination of efforts. Each Member State has appointed a senior representative to discuss these measures.

These regulations were developed to ensure that facilities have appropriate containment for the pathogens they wish to handle. Any facility wishing to import a human pathogen requiring containment levels 2, 3 or 4 must have a valid Health Canada permit before importation. Pathogens requiring containment level 1 facilities are not regulated by the HPIR, and therefore a permit is not required for their importation.",

The first is that, as recognized by WHO and demonstrated by IATA (which publishes its highly effective and widely accepted Regulations in consultation with ICAO), the lead role in legislative and regulatory control of the issue lies well within ICAO. The second is that, one has to go back to the basics of the rule book and start with the Preamble to the Chicago Convention. The Preamble unequivocally links the future development of aviation to \"general security\" which essentially means that aviation should not only be concerned with persons and property directly involved with air transport but also with the rest of the world that might be adversely affected by the release of infectious pathogens through aviation.",

Therefore it is extremely important for States to strictly enforce their dangerous goods legislation. It is also important to treat this subject holistically in terms of the world at large and not restrictively by singling out only those involved in the flight concerned. Finally, States have to adopt a security culture that admits of an overall approach to the threat as a potential harm to the health of humanity. This should inevitably include strict adherence by States to the provisions of Annexes 17 and 18 and inclusion of new Standards in the Annexes as necessary, together with an abiding understanding that the illegal carriage of infectious pathogens by air portends a threat both to safety and security of aviation.",
