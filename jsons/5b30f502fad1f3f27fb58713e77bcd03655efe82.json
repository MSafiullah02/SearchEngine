All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties was the primary objective of this study. A 1-mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for each source county.",

The results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside Guangdong Province (90%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties (46 in total) contributed 94% of the total batches during the two-month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January and June indicates a free-scale network property, and the network in January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and western regions of Guangdong Province.",

Abattoirs with larger slaughter capacity are usually located in suburban areas of a city. All wholesale live pig markets in this province are located in the cities of Guangzhou and Foshan, and it is estimated that approximately 5.7 million pigs are supplied annually to these two cities via live pig markets (P. Chen, personal communication, July 10, 2018). Approximately 90% of the pigs traded at these markets originate from piggeries located within Guangdong Province (P. Chen, personal communication, July 10, 2018). In 2015, small piggeries, that sell <50 pigs in a year, contributed 87.5% of the total number of pig farms in Guangdong Province (Statistic Beurau of Guangdong Province, 2016) . The live pig traders or their employees usually visit pig farms in several counties every day to collect pigs for subsequent resale in the markets. These pigs are transported to the markets in trucks either owned or hired by the traders, and which usually carry pigs sourced from multiple piggeries. However, some pig farmers transport their pigs directly to the live pig markets. At the markets, the traders rent pens which are used to contain pigs purchased from multiple pig farms. The pens are separated from each other by either an open metal fence or a low brick wall (approximately 1 m high). Pigs are then purchased by butchers/meat sellers. Some pig traders will offer a 'slaughter and delivery service' where the pigs selected by the butchers are identified and sent to a slaughterhouse, with the carcass subsequently delivered directly to the meat seller's stall. The meat sellers' stalls are not in the live pig trade markets and are often in a vegetable and meat market near residential areas. No pork is sold in these live pig trade markets. Pigs may stay in the markets for hours to days until being sent to slaughterhouses.",

This study aims to provide evidence for improved decision making and resource allocation to areas for prevention and control of disease. Trade patterns in live pig markets were described, and properties of the networks in January (winter, busy trade season) and in June (summer, quiet trade season) were compared to study the stability of the live pig market trade network in different months/seasons.

            "text": "When we transformed the 2-mode network into the 1-mode network, many of these counties became isolated nodes. We decided to simplify the network by deleting these nodes, because these counties which only occasionally supply pigs should have a low impact on the spread of disease between counties. It was not surprising that more pigs were traded in these markets in January than in June (504,570 vs. 442,315) because January is close to the Chinese Spring Festival and demand for meat increases before this festival (Pan et al., 2016) . of live poultry also changed accordingly . It is worth noting that the increased supply counties in this network resulted in a change in the structure of the local market trade network. (Liu et al., 2019) , and choosing counties based on convenience is unlikely to be effective. We used randomness to model these non-targeted scenarios, and we believe that our model, even with its limitations, has offered new insights for decision-makers to understand the disease risk in places before an epidemic occurs. The same methodology has been used in another similar study (Marquetoux et al., 2016) . It is worth noting that this study only focused on the pig movement network through local wholesale markets. Pigs are also traded through other systems in this province. For example, breeding pigs are often traded directly between pig farms, and weaners are often moved from breeding farms to fattening farms. Further studies on the movement of live pigs among local farms are needed.",

This indicates that they are potentially key players in a network, which should be targeted for disease control strategies. The connectivity was measured with different parameters in this study: degree, represent five different communities in the network, and nodes with the same colour belong to the same community F I G U R E 5 The connectivity of source counties in the combined static network of pig movement through wholesale live pig markets in Guangdong in January and June 2016 betweenness and closeness. Most of the counties with the highest degree were located in central, northern and western Guangdong. It is worth noting that the counties with high degree scores also had high betweenness and closeness values. These counties had larger pig populations than counties with lower connectivity. Thus, they are more likely to supply pigs to many markets at the same time. This result indicates that it will be very challenging to stop pig movement in counties with higher connectivity, during an emergency response to an epidemic. We suggest that besides movement suspension, other control measures such as emergency vaccination, enhanced quarantine, promotion of better biosecurity practices in the trading sector and education programs should also be implemented during emergency disease responses. The results of this study have provided insight on approaches for implementation of emergency responses to SI and other pig diseases in Guangdong Province. For example, the transmission of ASF in China (Ge et al., 2018; Normile, 2018; Wang, Sun, & Qiu, 2018) has been the result of long-distance movement of live pigs allowing the epidemic to propagate (Wang et al., 2018). Our findings show that the supply counties of the live pig markets in Guangdong Province included, not only counties inside this province but also counties from Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu and Henan provinces. Animal health authorities in Guangdong Province should pay more attention to outbreaks in these provinces, especially Hunan and Guangxi. These provinces contributed more pigs to the live pig markets in Guangdong Province than did other provinces (excluding Guangdong Province) and some counties in the middle of Hunan and east Guangxi had relatively high connectivity in the live pig market trading network. For early detection of ASF in Guangdong Province, counties inside/adjacent to Guangzhou and to the north and south-west of the province should also be targeted for active surveillance. Control measures against ASF adopted in China have included mass field screening of pigs, widespread sampling and testing, movement restrictions, thorough cleaning and disinfection of trucks transporting pigs, and registration of live pig traders (Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs, 2018). However, these measures can be a big burden for local governments. Social network analysis on animal movement can contribute to improving the efficiency of control measures when resources are limited by targeting priority areas. The current results indicate that, in an emergency response where often there are limited diagnostic and human resources, targeted surveillance and intervention would be a better strategy to control the potential magnitude of an outbreak among the source counties included in the market trading network. In this study, we found that if we isolated the 45 counties with higher connectivity (e.g. by movement restriction or enhanced quarantine), the magnitude of a potential epidemic could decrease substantially, in contrast to conducting control measures across the same number of randomly selected counties (10 vs. 70).",

As displayed in Figure 2, Baiyun (suburban area of Guangzhou city) and Sanshui (suburban area of Zhongshan city) supplied many pigs in January 2016, but the numbers supplied in June 2016 decreased dramatically. During our field investigation, we were told that many pig farms in these areas were closed in 2016 because of concerns arising from their environmental impact. Another reason could be price changes in neighbouring provinces, which may have provided incentives for traders to collect pigs from more distant counties.

In recent years, many countries and companies have established databases to record livestock movement(Bigras-Poulin et al., 2006;Kiss et al., 2006;Lee et al., 2017;Marquetoux et al., 2016). These data would be critical in tracing livestock movement during emergency responses and would favour SNA being used to inform the establishment of a proper disease control contingency plan. However, livestock trade (source and destination) is poorly recorded in many livestock markets in China. The most common source of live pig movement records in China is the official health certification of the traded pigs, which has limitations. Firstly, the certification record often lacks the name and location of the source farm, which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to effectively trace back to farms/animals in outbreak investigations. Secondly, data from the health certification system are not shared between provincial animal health authorities, even though live pig movements often cross provincial boundaries.A more comprehensive national database should be established in China. Detailed information on the location, species, farm size, type of source piggery (breeding, fattening, etc.) and livestock movements should be recorded and updated in a timely manner.",
