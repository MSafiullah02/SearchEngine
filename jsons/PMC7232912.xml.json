Since the virus gained international attention after its rapid spread in Hubei province in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in December 2019, it subsequently appeared in other Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan. While some might argue that it was na\u00efve of the \u2018Western World\u2019 to consider this crisis as a predominantly Asian problem for too long, the shutdown of large parts of society in practically all European countries and increasingly the rest of the world has made clear that this is a global crisis that affects all of us for much longer than expected. In this situation strong and decisive measures to save the lives and livelihoods of people across all parts of the world are needed.",

            "text": "However, more than ever before we are prepared to handle such crisis. Amongst others, Big data, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology can concretely help to deal with this emergency (Qadir et al. 2016). For example, location data from mobile phone companies can help in determining and understanding movement patterns of individuals and groups to potentially give insight into how the virus spreads and whether instructions are complied with (Ali et al. 2016). Governments and private corporations are developing apps that allow users to share their whereabouts and social contacts on a voluntary basis (Google Is Now Publishing Coronavirus Mobility Reports, Feeding off Users n.d.; Baharudin and Wong 2020); Experts Warn of Privacy Risk as US Uses GPS to Fight Coronavirus Spread 2020). Blockchain technology might be able to help keep a decentralised and cryptographically secure ledger of stocks and medication to create smart supply chain management (Zwitter and Boisse-Despiaux 2018). VR can help teachers explore new avenues of digital classrooms with new ways of interaction (Checa and Bustillo 2020). Nevertheless, as promising as the use of these emerging technologies might be, it is important to note that their use comes with a digital footprint that invariably has consequences for data protection and privacy \u2013 on a global scale (Zwitter 2015). Furthermore, political and corporate players might use the current situation to justify more intrusive data use for the future and for times after the pandemic is over.",

In conclusion, we propose that guiding principles and standards for data practices in the humanitarian field are applicable during this crisis, and they should be considered as minimum standards for all states and corporations considering the use of data-driven monitoring tools to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.",

The insights presented by this app are based on the analysis of location data collected through phone networks, WiFi connections, satellite-based radio navigation system (e.g. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo) and other surveillance assemblages producing data that reveal the location of individuals and crowds. Furthermore, apps with maps to track the disease also became popular very quickly in Hong Kong (Latest Situation of Novel Coronavirus Infection in Hong Kong n.d.), and South Korea (Coronavirus Mobile Apps Are Surging in popularity in South Korea - CNN n.d.). In the PRC, this approach seems to have evolved into the \u2018Alipay Health Code\u2019, a system that classifies residents based on an opaque methodology (Mozur et al. 2020). Once a survey has been filled out by a user, this data gets combined with other sources such as location data. Once the data has been analysed, a QR code is generated which has one of three colours; green enables its bearer to unrestricted movement, the \u2018owner\u2019 of a yellow code may be asked to stay home for 7 days, and a red QR code results in two-weeks of quarantine.",

Undoubtedly, in times of crisis there is an increased need for governments to monitor and control the public, which might make it necessary to limit individual freedom. Such decisionism characterizes many emergencies. Constitutions and human rights, however, are designed with such crises in mind. Furthermore, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and on the European level the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), are prepared to deal with such situations. Considering such developments from a formal perspective, it is useful to take a look at the legal and institutional framework of the Council of Europe (CoE). This international organization administers and controls one of the most important international human rights treaties guaranteeing individual freedoms, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The CoE has established procedures and case-law for times of crisis like the current one (Mokhtar 2004).",

However, many other rights are subject to derogation, including particularly the right to privacy, freedom of expression, the freedom of movement, as well as the freedom of assembly and association.

Nevertheless, they have to be weighed against respective benefits and risks.data-breaches are inevitable; with time (t) approaching infinity, the chance of any system being hacked or becoming insecure approaches 100%. Hence, it is not a question of whether, but when. Therefore, organisations have to prepare sound data retention and deletion policies.data ethics is an obligation to provide high quality analysis; using machine learning and big data might be appealing for the moment, but the quality of source data might be low, and results might be unreliable, or even harmful. Biases in incomplete datasets, algorithms and human users are abundant and widely discussed.

Eventually, we will need to think of including data policies into legal frameworks for state of emergency regulations, and coordinate with corporate stakeholders as well as private organisations on how to best deal with such crises. Data-driven practices have to be used in a responsible manner. Furthermore, it will be important to observe whether data practices and surveillance assemblages introduced under current circumstances will be rolled back to status quo ante when returning to normalcy. If not, our rights will become hollowed out, just waiting for the next crisis to eventually become irrelevant.",
