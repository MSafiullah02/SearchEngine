B-type CpG ODN primarily activates B cells, resulting in their proliferation and antibody secretion. C-type CpG ODN shares the activities of both A- and B-type CpG ODN [3], [8], [9], [10], [11].",

Subcutaneous injection of CpG ODN in sheep induced a dose-dependent increase in 2\u20325\u2032-A synthetase, an anti-viral effector molecule, in serum of sheep [15]. Administration of CpG ODN through genital tract enhanced innate immunity and protected mice from herpes virus infection [16], [17], [18]. Mice pretreated with CpG ODN before respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection produced a large amount of IFN-\u03b3 in the lung that was associated with significantly reduced mucus secretion of the virus [19]. Treatment of Friend virus-infected mice with CpG ODN significantly reduced the virus burden in blood and enhanced virus-specific cellular immune responses [20]. Administration of CpG ODN to SAM-P1 mice (senescence-accelerated model mice) induced a quick clearance of influenza virus and considerably improved the survival of the mice challenged with lethal dose of influenza virus [21]. Recently, treatment of hepatitis C patients with CpG ODN was reported to reduce hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in a phase I study, and the reduction was consistent with the elevation of IFN-\u03b1 and other markers associated with an anti-viral immune response.",

First, we have systemically screened the function of these CpG ODNs to stimulate human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to produce anti-viral activity analyzed by an anti-viral bioassay. We have selected a novel type of CpG ODN (BW001), which shows the most potent ability in anti-VSV activity in a bioassay. BW001 displays B-type CpG ODN structure feature at the 5\u2032 and A-type CpG ODN structure feature at the 3\u2032. BW001 showed a potent activity in inhibiting the cytolytic effect of SARS-CoV to Vero E6 cells. We found that BW001 displays the functional activity of C-type CpG ODN because it induces human PBMCs and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce high level of IFN-\u03b1, stimulates human PBMCs and B cells to proliferate and activates CD19+ B cells and CD56+ NK cells. We suggest that BW001, a novel type of CpG ODN, may have the potential to be developed for anti-SARS prevention and therapy.",

Two of well-known prototype CpG ODNs, 2216 as an A-type CpG ODN and 2006 as a B-type CpG ODN, were used as controls. In VSV protection assays, human PBMCs were stimulated with BW001 or control CpG ODNs, and the culture supernatants were tested for the ability to protect Vero E6 cells from VSV infection. As shown in Fig. 1A, BW001-stimulated supernatants protected Vero E6 cells from challenge by 10\u00d7 TCID50 of VSV. This level of protection was similar to that induced by 2216 (P > 0.05) and significantly higher than that induced by 2006 (P < 0.05). The anti-viral activity was due to the presence of the CG dinucleotide in the BW001 because BW002, which shared the same sequence as the BW001 except the order of the CG was reversed, did not induce the anti-VSV activity in the supernatant of cultured human PBMCs.",

Recombinant IFN-\u03b2 was shown to exhibit the highest anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV in vitro [27]. Pegylated IFN-\u03b1 was shown to reduce viral replication and excretion in SARS-CoV infected macaques [28]. These findings suggest the possible applications of type I IFN to treat SARS patients. However, direct application of type I IFN has severe drawbacks. First, repeated application of recombinant IFN-\u03b1 in humans induces antibody responses and results in loss of therapeutic efficacy. Second, there are at least 13 subtypes of IFN-\u03b1 in humans. It is difficult to produce all of them for human use. In fact, natural IFN-\u03b1 was found to have higher anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV in vitro than recombinant IFN-\u03b1 [27], probably due to the presence of multiple subtypes of IFN-\u03b1 following natural induction. To overcome this difficult, one possibility is to use CpG ODNs to induce the production of IFN by endogenous cells. We show that BW001 induces human PBMCs and pDCs to secrete large amount of IFN-\u03b1. Indeed, at least eight subtypes of IFN-\u03b1 are produced following BW001 stimulation of human PBMCs (data not shown). Consistently, BW001-stimulated PBMCs supernatants exhibit potent anti-SARS-CoV activity.",

Additionally, activated NK cells and monocytes can also produce cytokines, which may exhibit different anti-virus activities. We found that NK cells (CD56+) in human PBMCs could be activated by BW001. Activation of these cells is probably indirect because studies have shown that CpG ODN-induced type I IFN, cytokines and chemokines trigger a wide range of secondary effects, including NK cell activation [29]. In our study, we also found that BW001 could enhance NK cell cytotoxicity after stimulating human PBMCs, implying that BW001 was capable of triggering all innate anti-virus immunity in vivo including type I IFN production and NK activation.",

The data suggest that 2216 is also an optimal CpG ODN for inducing anti-SARS-CoV immunity. Comparatively, in light of application, BW001 with full phosphorothioated backbone may be more resistant to the nuclease digestion than 2216 whose backbone is partial phosphorothioated.
