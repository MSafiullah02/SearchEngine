Recently, several new viruses have been discovered that are associated with respiratory infections in children [see reviews by Kahn, 2007; Sloots et al., 2008] . The human metapneumovirus was first discovered in Netherlands [ Van der Hoogen et al., 2001] , and is now reported to be an important global cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Similarly, human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and HKU1 were first isolated in the Netherlands [ Van der Hoek et al., 2004] , and Hong Kong [Woo et al., 2005] , respectively, and have been reported to be associated with acute respiratory infections in children. Both strains have been detected subsequently in patients from other countries [see reviews by Van der Hoek et al., 2006; Pyrc et al., 2007] .",

This virus was referred to as human bocavirus (HBoV), and it was distinct genetically from the human parvovirus B19. Since its initial discovery, HBoV has been detected in children with lower respiratory tract infections in several different countries [see review by Allander, 2008] . In Asia, HBoV has been reported in Thailand [Fry et al., 2007] , China [Qu et al., 2007] , South Korea [Choi et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2006 Chung et al., , 2007 Lee et al., 2007] , Japan [Ma et al., 2006] , and Hong Kong [Lau et al., 2007a] .

For the PCR testing of HBoV, the reaction was performed in a 50 ml reaction mixture containing 0.5 mM of each primer, 2.5 U Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA), 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , in the conventional PCR machine. In the case of HCoV, the PCR reaction was carried out in a 25 ml reaction mixture containing SYBR Green RT-PCR reaction mix (Biorad, Hercules, CA) with 0.7 mM of each primer, and 0.5 ml of iScript reverse transcriptase (Biorad) in the I-Cycler (Biorad). At the end of the reaction, the products were subjected to a melting curve analysis by heating the products to 958C for 1 min, and then cooling to 558C for 45 sec, and heating back to 958C at 0.58C intervals. Positive products are represented by HCoV-specific melting peak as described [Escutenaire et al., 2007] , and were confirmed by agarose gel analysis with visualisation in the presence of ethidium bromide staining. RHV identification was carried out with 0.5 mM of each forward and reverse primer, 0.1 mM of Taqman probe in Superscript reverse transcriptase/Platinum Taq enzyme reaction mix (Invitrogen Corporation) in the LightCycler machine (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).

Most reported studies on the detection of HBoV have been carried out in patients who exhibited respiratory symptoms, and there were few parallel studies on healthy children. Similarly, this current study did not examine the incidence of HBoV in healthy children, or other pediatric patients with nonrespiratory symptoms. However, a recent report had clearly described the detection rate in healthy children to be less significant than that in children exhibiting clinical symptoms consistent with respiratory tract infections [Garcia-Garcia et al., 2008] . Several reports have also noted the presence of HBoV in fecal [Lau et al., 2007a; Lee et al., 2007; Vicente et al., 2007] and urine samples from children [Pozo et al., 2007] , suggesting that the virus is associated with both enteric and respiratory infections. The current study did not find any symptoms of gastroenteritis presented by the HBoV patients.

Interestingly, in 17 (42.5%) of the patients infected with HBoV, the presence of RSV, PIV1 and 3, and RHV were also detected ( Table II) . The rate of HBoV coinfection was almost similar to the 40% coinfections reported in Thai pediatric patients [Chieochansin et al., 2008] , but less than that reported elsewhere [Pozo et al., 2007; Hindiyeh et al., 2008 ]. In the current study, both RSV and RHV each accounted for 6 (35%) and 8 (47%) of the coinfections respectively, with PIV at 3 (17.6%). Of the 17 patients who showed evidence of coinfections with respiratory viruses, 47% exhibited lower respiratory tract infections, lower than that caused by single HBoV infections, while 29% of these exhibited upper respiratory tract infections. Four of the eight coinfected with RHV showed lower respiratory tract infections, compared to only two out of six patients coinfected with RSV. Coinfections with more than one of the other respiratory viruses were not detected.",

A 245 bp region of the NS1 gene sequence was used to analyze the genetic relatedness of the Singapore isolates as described previously [Chung et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006] . The Singapore HBoV isolates showed nt identity ranging from 91% to 100% with published HBoV sequences. Approximately 60% of the Singapore HBoV isolates were identical at the nt sequence level, and the remaining HBoV isolates showed only minor nt differences. This highly conserved sequence identity is consistent with HBoV which has been isolated in other countries [Chung et al., 2006; Qu et al., 2007] . The HBoV sequences were aligned, and percent sequence homology was calculated and phylogenetic trees were constructed as described in Materials and Methods Section. The analysis showed that the majority of the Singapore HBoV strains clustered with the prototype virus, st1 strain, that was first detected in Sweden (Fig. 1 ). In addition, the Singapore HBoV strains appeared to be closely related to canine minute virus and bovine parvovirus than the human parvovirus Fig. 1 . Phylogenetic analysis of the partial NS1 gene region (245 bp) for HBoV detected from hospitalized pediatric patients. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method and the bootstrap values were generated in 1,000 replicates.

SIN represents Singapore and 05 represents the year the specimen was collected. # SIN05-NTU-12 is the representative strain for a cluster of 24 strains, comprising of specimen numbers SIN05- 22, 46, 79, 86, 150; 167, 218, 243, 250, 258, 263, 268, 275, 290, 325, 328, 371, 374; 427, 441 , and 500, with 100% sequence similarity at the nucleotide level.

Only three HCoVs were detected from the 500 specimens. Their PCR amplicons was subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm their identities by blasting the sequences with published HCoV sequences. SIN06-NTU-259 was confirmed to be HCoV-OC43, whereas both SIN06-NTU-211 and SIN07-NTU-395 were HCoV-NL63. The Singapore HCoV-NL63 strains showed 100% nt identities with each other, and with the Dutch NL63 strains. Interestingly, the phylogenetic tree constructed at the partial orf 1b gene region showed that the Singapore HCoV-NL63 isolates, SIN06-NTU-211 and SIN07-NTU-395, clustered with the Dutch strains, away from the rest of the HCoVs including the recent strains of HCoV-NL63 from Australia and Japan (Fig. 2) . SIN06-NTU-259, as expected, clustered with the HCoV-OC43. The clustering of the HCoVs was somewhat similar to that reported by Escutenaire et al. [2007] .",

Respiratory viruses were detected in 141 of the specimens, giving an incident rate of 28.2%. RSV was the most common virus detected in the current study (11.8%), followed by HBoV (8.0%), and HMPV (5.8%). The rate of HBoV detection in this study was similar to that reported in China [Qu et al., 2007] and South Korea [Chung et al., 2006] , but was higher than the reported rates in Thailand [Fry et al., 2007] , Japan [Ma et al., 2006] , and in several non-Asian countries [Allander et al., 2005; Arnold et al., 2006; Bastien et al., 2006; Foulongne et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006] . One reason for the difference in incidence rates could be the criteria used in the sampling population. For example, in a report by Sloots et al. [2006] the study population included hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients exhibiting both lower respiratory tract infections and upper respiratory tract infections, with a wide age range from 7 days to 86 years. In contrast to the current study, and that reported from China and South Korea, the sampling population was confined to hospitalized children exhibiting respiratory tract infections.",

            "text": "Coinfections of HBoV with a range of respiratory viruses have been reported, with the highest rates at 69% and 60% in children admitted to hospital in Israel [Hindiyeh et al., 2008] and Spain, respectively [Pozo et al., 2007] . A high proportion of these HBoV coinfections have been associated with either RSV, HMPV, or PIV [Choi et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2006; Fry et al., 2007] . The Israeli study also reported a high rate of coinfection with adenoviruses [Hindiyeh et al., 2008] . Recent studies have also suggested a correlation between the severity of infection and the presence of coinfections involving HBoV [Allander et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2006; Foulongne et al., 2006; Manning et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006; Fry et al., 2007;  see review by Schildgen et al., 2008] . For example, in a recent study in Thailand, wheezing was associated in patients infected with HBoV and coinfected with RSV, PIV, or RHV, compared to single infections with these viruses [Fry et al., 2007] . In the same study, a significant number of patients presented with lower respiratory tract infections in which HBoV was the only virus detected. This trend of coinfections with other respiratory viruses was also observed in the current study. In the current study, 50% of the coinfections with RHV caused lower respiratory tract infections in children, whereas in contrast, only 33% of the coinfections with RSV caused lower respiratory tract infections. Interestingly, a recent study described the association of HBoV coinfections with RHV-A, as well as a newly identified RHV species, designated as RHV-C by Lau et al. [2007b] . RHV is also an important cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Coinfections with HBoV may exacerbate the symptoms in children, giving rise to hospital admission with the requirement of intensive medical care. Coinfections with RSV and HMPV have also been associated with an increase severity in respiratory infections, although this correlation remains controversial. Some reports have described an increased severity in a high proportion of coinfections [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005] , whereas in others, a low proportion of co-infections or no coinfections were found [Al-Sonboli et al., 2006; Mackay et al., 2006] . However, in the previous report [Loo et al., 2007] and the current study, only single HMPV infections were detected among the Singaporean children. The increased severity in coinfections with respiratory viruses remained to be challenged. A larger sampling population, and a longer duration for the study of coinfections will be required to confirm the correlation.",

Five hundred specimens were analyzed, and an infection rate for HBoV at 8% was reported, with 55% of these patients were 1 year old or younger. A significant level of coinfection was also detected in the patients with HBoV, with RSV and RHV being the most common viruses detected. 52% of the HBoV patients in which HBoV was the sole agent detected showed evidence of lower respiratory tract infection, which compared with 47% of the HBoV coinfections. This study, therefore, suggests that HBoV is a significant cause of lower respiratory tract infections among the pediatric population of Singapore. Furthermore, the current data suggest that single infection with HBoV is sufficient to cause severe respiratory infection, and the clinical significance of HBoV coinfections with other respiratory viruses in Singapore remains to be established.",
