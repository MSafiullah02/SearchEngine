            "text": "Steroids are an imperative group of hormones which play a key role in the transmission of signals that mediate growth and physiological responses in most pluricellular organisms. Brassinosteroids (BRs), a class of plant-specific steroid hormones, control many of the developmental and physiological processes like their animal counterparts, including regulation of gene expression, cell division and expansion, differentiation, programmed cell death, and homeostasis. Recent studies have indicated that these hormones have antiviral, antifungal, antiproliferative, antibacterial, neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties in animal system. BRs analogues have been reported to have antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), arenaviruses as well as against replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in Vero cells. Also, antiherpetic activities both in a human conjunctive cell line (IOBA-NHC) and murine herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) experimental models have been reported. In human cells, anticancer structure-activity relationship of natural BRs revealed their high cytotoxic activity. Since, BRs and their analogues are reported to inhibit cell growth in cancer cell lines, they may be considered as promising phytohormones for potential anticancer drugs. The use of pollens in folk medicine also indicates scope of steroids of plant pollens in medicines. An attempt has been made in this paper to document the information available on the prospects of BRs in therapeutics.",

            "text": "Steroids are vital for both plants and animals because they act as hormones. A number of sterols and steroids are produced in plants (Geuns, 1978) . Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of naturally occurring polyhydroxy of bee-collected rape (Brassica napus L.) pollen with growth promoting activities. In 1982, another steroidal substance namely, castasterone was isolated from insect galls of chestnut (Castanea crenata) (Yokota et al., 1982; Mandava, 1988) . Since there are a number of BRs that have been reported in plants and it was assumed that they are ubiquitous occurrence in plant kingdom and are characterized from 44 plant species including angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophyte and an alga (Clouse and Sasse, 1998; Fujioka et al., 1998; Yokota et al., 1998; Rao et al., 2002) . Till date, there are 70 BRs that have been isolated from 27 families of higher plants and three families of lower plants (Bajguz and Tretyn, 2003) . BRs have a common 5\u03b1 cholestane skeleton, but their functional variations are due to the different orientations of functionalities on the basic skeleton basis of alkyl-substitution pattern of the side chain (Yokota et al., 1997) . (Fujioka and Sakurai, 1997) . Classification of these steroids is done on the steroidal hormones with significant growth promoting activity (Clouse, 1996; Rao et al., 2002) . Grove et al. (1979) isolated Brassinolide (BL) from 40 kg BRs promote cell elongation, cell division, differentiation, disease resistance, 2002; Mussig et al., 2002) . In plants BRs also confer resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses (Khripach et al., 2000; Ikekawa and Zhao, 1991) . They provide resistance against wide spectrum of environmental stresses produced by low and high temperature (Dhaubhadel et al., 1999) , drought (Li and Van Staden, 1998) , salt (Sasse et al., 1995) , infection and pesticides (Sasse, 1999) and heavy metals (Bajguz, 2000; Janeczko et al., 2005; Bhardwaj et al., 2007) . The focus of attention during the past few decades was on the physiological properties of brassinosteroids (Krishna, 2003) . BRs have multiple involvement in the regulation of plant physiological activities such as cell expansion, cell division, alteration of membrane properties, vegetative growth, reproductive biology, senescence, seed germination and stress management plethora of stresses against which the brassinosteroids act are thermal, drought, heavy metals, infection, pesticides, salt and even viruses (Dhaubhadel et al., 1999 (Dhaubhadel et al., , 2002 Janeczko et al., 2009; Wachsman et al., 2000 Wachsman et al., , 2002 Wachsman et al., , 2004a Wachsman et al., , 2004b Krishna, 2003; Haubrick and Assmann, 2006) . (Ozdemir et al., 2004; Khripach et al., 2000; Bhardwaj et al., 2006) . The stress tolerance and senescence in plants (Kauschmann et al., 1996) (Clouse and so additional harmful effects are not likely from their use in agriculture. This assumption is an important prerequisite for considering BRs as ecologically safe, non-toxic chemicals for agriculture. However, conformation of their safety can be obtained from toxicological studies. A study on animal system reveals their role as antiviral, antifungal, antiproliferative, antibacterial, neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties in animal systems. BRs analogues have been reported to have antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), arenaviruses as well as against replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in Vero cells. Antiherpetic activities both in a human conjunctive cell line (IOBA-NHC) and murine herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) experimental models have been reported. In human cells, anticancer structureactivity relationship of natural BRs revealed their high cytotoxic activity. Since, both BRs and analogues are reported to inhibit cell growth in cancer cell lines thus BRs may be considered as promising phytohormones for potential anticancer/antiviral/antibacterial drugs. In agriculture several abiotic stresses have been reported to occur simultaneously, rather than a particular stress condition, which are most lethal to crops but the co-occurrence of different stresses is rarely addressed by molecular biologists (Mittler, 2006) .",

In our earlier studies, we have reported that EBL and 28-Homobrassinolide (HBL) treatments (presowing) improved the shoot emergence and plant biomass production in Brassica juncea seedlings and plants under heavy metal stress (Cu, Zn, Mn, Co and Ni). EBL and HBL have also been found to reduce the heavy metal uptake and accumulation in B. juncea seedlings and plants (Sharma and Bhardwaj, 2007a,b; Sharma et al., 2007 Sharma et al., , 2008 Bhardwaj et al., 2007 Bhardwaj et al., , 2008 . HBL protected chickpea (Cicer arietinum) from Cd toxicity by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutase, Catalase and Guaiacol peroxidase), proline content, nitrate reductase and carbonic anhydrase and also by increasing the plant growth, leghemoglobin content, nodule number, nitrogen and carbohydrate injuries and salinity (Sasse, 1999; Bajguz and Hayat, 2008) . 24-Epibrassinolide According to Khripach et al. (2000) the metabolism of BRs in mammals has not yet been investigated. It may be speculated, however, that a normal catabolism of the steroidal skeleton will take place. Being normal constituents of practically all plants, BRs have been, and are, consumed by mammals,",

The potential of BRs to enhance plant resistance against fungal pathogen infection has been documented in several studies (Khripach et al., 2000) . Vasyukova et al. (1994) reported that the treatment of potato plants with BRs, essentially reduced the incidence of Phytophthora infection. BRs and their synthetic derivatives were reported to be good inhibitors of herpes simplex virus type 1(HSV-1) and arena virus replication in cell culture (Wachsman et al., 2004a (Wachsman et al., , 2004b .

Effects of BRs on insect development, particularly on molting, were reviewed by Zullo and Adam (2002) . The treatment of brassinosteroids to root knot nematodes (M. incognita) also stimulated their antioxidative defence system (Ohri et al., 2007) . Further Ohri et al.

            "text": "Ecdysteroids exert widespread effects on insect growth and development. These include roles in morphogenesis, proliferation, programmed cell death, cuticle synthesis, oogenesis and developmental timing (Robertson, 1936; Riddiford, 1993) . It is intriguing that some aspects of these pathways share features in common with the wide range of developmental and physiological differences that define plant and animal cells. Thus, the presence of a rigid cel wall in plants demands changes at the level of cell wall-associated proteins to control changes in overall cell shape. Similarly, the integrity of an insect cell is defined by an internal cytoskeleton, which is the target for ecdysteroid triggered changes in cell shape. responses to BRs in plants, which also include promotion of cell division, expansion, and programmed cell death and modulation of reproductive development (Tummel and Chory, 2002) . For example, both BL and ecdysteroids are required for cell shape, changes associated with maturation-although they exert this effect in different ways. As described above, BL induces the expression of a range of cell wall-associated proteins that are implicated in cell expansion, pro viding molecular basis for understanding the role of BRs in directing cell elon gation and plant growth. Similarly, ecdysteroids trigger the morphogenesis of adult structures during metamorphosis through coordinated changes in cell shape manifested at the level of the actin cytoskeleton (Von Kalm et al., 1995) . It is interesting to speculate that these two responses reflect the basic architectural This response has been extensively studied in Drosophila and shown to occur by autophagy with hallmark features of apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation and caspase activation (Jiang et al., 1997; Jochova et al., 1997; Lee and Baehrecke, 2001) . There is evidence that BRs induce programmed cell death during xylogenesis. The specialized xylem vessels that conduct water through plants are made up of individual dead cells called tracheary elements (Roberts and McCann 2000) . The BR-deficient Arabidopsis mutants cpd and dwf7 have abnormal xylem, implicating the hormone in xylogenesis, although these phenotypes have not been examined in detail Choe et al., 1999) . In addition, Clouse and Zurek (1991) observed that exogenously supplied BL promotes both tracheary element differentiation and cell division in cultured tuber explants of Jerusalem artichoke. Using a zinnia system (Zinnia elegans L. cv Canary Bird) in which single mesophyll cells can differentiate directly into tracheary elements, it was observed that exogenously supplied uniconazole (an inhibitor of both gibberellin and BR biosynthesis) prevents uncommitted cells from differentiating into tracheary elements and that BL but not gibberellin overcomes this inhibition (Iwasaki and Shibaoka, 1991) . Moreover, BRs appear to act specifically during the final stage of xylogenesis, which involves secondary wall formation and cell death. During this time, the levels of BRs rise dramatically (Yamamoto et al., 2001) . The role of BRs in apoptosis and programmed cell death make them potential candidates in the management of lifecycles and different developmental stages of insects and nematodes which spoils the agricultural crops, thereby, helping in sustainable agriculture.",

(1994) carried out investigations on the interaction between Phytophthora infestans and potato tubers. The treatment of potato plants with BRs, essentially reduced the incidence of Phytophthora infection. The increase in resistance in BRs treated potato tubers was associated with enhancement of ABA and ethylene levels and the presence of phenolic and terpenoid substances. BR-induced disease resistance was also noted in barley and cucumber plants. Spraying barley plants at tillering phase with EBL decreased an extent of leaf disease induced by Helminthosporium teres Sacc. and increased grain yield even at a dose of 5 mg ha \u22121 (Pshenichnaya et al., 1997; Volynets et al., 1997a,b) . The protective effects of EBL in cucumber against fungi were studied by Churikova and Vladimirova (1997) . The increased activities of peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of polyphenols, was suggested as a factor contributing to BR induced disease resistance in cucumber plants. The antifungal potential of BRs indicates their prospects for antifungal formulations to plants against several fungal diseases, but the study needs to be carried for other fungal infections in plants.",

Furthermore, BRs and their synthetic derivatives were reported to be good inhibitors of herpes simplex virus type 1(HSV-1) and arena virus replication in cell culture. Wachsman et al. (2004b) described synthetic methods to obtain BRs analogues and report the scope of antiviral activity of these compounds against RNA and DNA viruses. Some of the compounds showed selectivity indexes (SI) 10-to 18-fold higher than ribavirin, a broad spectrum antiviral compound, when tested against Junin virus (JV) (Arenaviridae); a good antiviral activity against measles virus (MV) (Paramixoviridae), with SI values also higher than ribavirin used as reference drug, and a similar or lower activity Wachsman et al., 2004b) against herpes simplex type 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) (Herpesviridae) when compared to foscarnet or acyclovir, respectively. Structure activity relationship studies (SAR) were analyzed, in order to detect which stereochemistry, type and position of functional groups were needed to develop a selective class of virus inhibitors. A variety of chemical structures are currently known as inhibitors of pathogenic virus replication. Nucleoside synthetic analogues are the most successful ones, in clinical use, against infections caused by most perilous viruses disseminated among human population. Several other molecules have been designed to interrupt specifically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication by inhibiting viral proteases or, in the case of influenza virus, to mimic the substrate for sialidase enzymatic activity. Unfortunately, viruses respond to antiviral treatment with a rapid selection of drug resistant mutant particles, compelling virologists to search for new active compounds. Animal viruses tested for their susceptibility to BRs analogues comprised two RNA monocistronic viral families, Paramyxoviridae and Arenaviridae, and one DNA virus family Herpesviridae, all of them are important human pathogens. Preliminary studies by Wachsman et al. (2004b) with brassinolide have shown significant in vitro antiviral activity against various RNA and DNA viruses (Tables 1 and 2) . Michelini et al. (2004) have reported the in vitro and in vivo antiherpetic activity of three new synthetic BRs analogues. Chemical synthesis of three new synthetic BRs analogues like (22S,23S)-3\uf062-bromo-5\uf061,22,23-trihydroxystigmastan-6-one, (22S, 23S)-5\uf061-fluoro-3\uf062-22,23-trihydroxystigmastan-6one, (22S, 23S)-3\uf062-5\uf061,22,23-trihydroxystigmastan-6-one and their antiherpetic activity both in human conjunctive cell lines (IOBA-NHC) and in the murine herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) experimental model were tested. All compounds prevented HSV-1multiplication in NHC cells in a dose dependent manner when added after infection with no cytotoxicity. Significantly, in vitro studies showed that EBL is capable of reducing or even arresting the growth of the HIV in cultured infected cells. Khripach et al. (2005) reported that EBL may be used in the prevention and cure of HIV infection and related conditions (AIDS related complex), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, or when exposure to HIV virus was suspected. Further, Talarico et al. (2006) investigated that the replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) Type 1 in Vero cells is inhibited in the presence of (22S,23S)-3 -bromo-5 ,22,23trihydroxystigmastan-6-one (6b), a synthetic brassinosteroid derivative. Since a late step of virus multiplication is hindered by 6b, a study was performed on drug-drug combination with acyclovir (ACV) and foscarnet (FOS). It was determined that 6b would act synergistically with low concentrations of ACV and moderate concentrations of FOS against HSV. The best drug combination tested in this study resulted in an increase of 29.3 and 47.2% in antiviral activity for ACV (0.036 \u00b5M) and FOS (37.5 \u00b5M) in the presence of 14.8 and 6.9 \u00b5M of 6b, respectively. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, is an enveloped single-strand RNA virus that causes an economically important disease in cattle, horses and swine. Romanutti et al. (2007) reported the antiviral effects of a synthetic BR ((22S, 23S)-3\uf062-bromo-5\uf061,22,23-trihydroxystigmastan-6-one) against the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in vero cells. Synthetic BR affected the late event of the virus growth cycle and inhibited virus protein synthesis and viral mature particle formation. Time-related experiments showed that 6b mainly affects a late event of the virus growth cycle. Virus adsorption, internalization and early RNA synthesis are not the target of the inhibitory action. Results obtained indicate that the antiviral compound adversely affects virus protein synthesis and viral mature particle formation. Synergistic in vitro Interactions between (22S,23S)-3 -Bromo-5 Herpes simplex Virus Type 1 were studied.",

Steady-state parameters of semicontinuous cultures conducted at EBL concentrations from 10 -16 to 10 -9 mol l -1 were evaluated. Typical effects of the EBL found both in standard and in diluted media were increased in the value of mitochondrial membrane potential, drop of intracellular antibody level, increase in the fraction of the cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase, and decrease in the fraction of the cells in the S phase.

To determine basic anticancer structure-activity relationships of natural BRs on human cells, several normal and cancer cell lines have been used. Several of the tested BRs were found to have high effects of the most promising and readily available BR analogues with interesting anticancer properties, 28-homocastasterone and 24-epibrassinolide, on the viability, proliferation, and cycling of hormone-sensitive/insensitive (MCF-7/MDA-MB-468) breast and (LNCaP/DU-145) prostate cancer cell lines to determine whether the discovered cytotoxic activity of BRs could be, at least partially, related to brassinosteroid-nuclear receptor interactions. Both BRs inhibited cell growth in a dose dependent manner in the cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis showed that BR treatment arrested, MDA-MB-468, LNCaP and MCF-7 cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468, LNCaP, and slightly in the DU-145 cells. These results proved that natural BRs, at micromolar concentrations, can inhibit the growth, at micromolar concentrations, of several human cancer cell lines without affecting the growth of normal cells. Therefore, these plant hormones are promising leads for potential anticancer drugs. Compounds 6b [(22S,23S)-3\u03b2-bromo5\u03b1,22,23-trihydroxystigmastan-6-one], 1d [(22R,23R)-2\u03b1,3\u03b1,22,23-tetrahydroxy-Homo-7-oxa-stigmastan-6-one], 8a [(22R,23R)-3\u03b2-fluoro-22,23dihydroxystigmastan-6-one], 9b [(22S,23S)-3\u03b2-fluoro-5\u03b1,22, 23-trihydroxystigmastan-6-one] and 10b [(22S,23S)-5\u03b1-fluor-3 \u03b2,22,23trihydroxystigmastan-6-one], with selectivity indexes (SI) of 40, 57,31, 37 and 53, are the derivatives with good antiviral activity against MV. These SI values are higher than those obtained with ribavirin (used as reference drug). A comparative analysis of 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values, using confluent non-growing cells, gives an indication of structure-activity relationship. According to their degree of cytotoxicity the compounds were divided in three groups: low, intermediate and high cytotoxicity. By observing the chemical structures of compounds belonging to the first group we can see that less cytotoxic activities are related to the presence of a 3\u03b2-hydroxy group on C-3 (ring A) and a double bond between C-22 and C-23 (side chain). The replacement of a 5\u03b1-hydroxy group by a 5\u03b1-fluoro group enhances cytotoxicity. Halogenated brassinosteroid derivatives in C-3 position are more cytotoxic than those with an acetoxy group in the same position. For compounds 1d, 6b, 10b and ribavirin, cytotoxicity measurements were also done with replicating cells; CC50 values were low, but they still competed favourably with ribavirin against MV. cytotoxic activity.

Contrary, 24-epi-brassinolide is not metabolized in sexual to induce disc evagination in vitro was 158 and 87 nM, respectively. Injections Rupprecht and Holsboer (1999) reported that steroids influence neuronal function by binding to intracellular receptors that can act as transcription factors and regulate gene expression. In addition, some so-called 'neuroactive steroids' are potent modulators of an array of ligand-gated ion channels and of distinct G-protein coupled receptors via nongenomic mechanisms, and they can influence sleep and memory. They described how these neuroactive steroids modulate neurotransmitter receptors and address the neuro-psychopharmacological potential that arose from the intracellular crosstalk between genomic and nongenomic steroid effects. Neuroactive steroids could also have a role in the response to stress and the treatment of psychiatric disorders, such as depression, and, as they affect a broad spectrum of behavioral functions through their unique molecular properties, they could constitute a yet unexploited class of drugs.",

Brassinosteroids (BRs) an important group of plant steroid hormones being mainly concentrated in plant pollens are reported to be involved in biostimulation in folk medicine. They also form the basis for the production of some anti-inflammatory and metabolism stimulative medicines, which are especially recommended for children and elderly people with chronic infections (Mashkovskii, 1997) . Further, they have bright prospects as potential drugs against viruses like measles, herpes and arena viruses; bacteria, fungi and other pathogens. Although it is too early to predict their clinical utility, but there are evidences that BRs are emerging group of compounds as anti-cancer and antiviral drugs. Further illustrative studies to elucidate eventual anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerous and medicinal effects of BRs in animal models would confirm their use as therapeutics in traditional medicines.",
