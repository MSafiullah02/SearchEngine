No disease outbreak or epidemic escapes media coverage, whether it is an enteric disease due to contaminated lettuce, foodborne botulism, or the threat of \u201cbird flu.\u201d As Laurie Garrett points out in her thought-provoking book The Coming Plague (1995), we seem to be living in a world that is out of balance. Our era may very well be characterized by eruptions of new diseases, epidemics of old diseases moving into new areas, diseases that are sparked by advances in technology, and diseases that come to us from insects and animals as civilization invades ecologies where humans have not trodden before (Garrett, 1995). Although these encounters have been occurring throughout history, technology now enables us to define the problems with great acuity. Our ability to determine the causal relationship among pathogen, host, and disease relies heavily on state-of-the-art technologies brought to us by advances in science and engineering. Still, to this day the microscope remains a primary tool in the toolbox. Moreover, electron microscopy provides researchers with high-powered visual proof of the existence of the pathogens that cause disease (Fig. 5.1\n).\n",

In the last 12 years there have been a little more than 800 confirmed cases of H5N1 bird flu in humans. However, more than 50% of those human cases resulted in death and approximately 400 million birds have died either directly from the illness or indirectly from the control efforts aimed at eliminating the problem. Public health officials fear that H5N1 may spark the next pandemic.

This is described as an emerging pathogen that has a potentially high morbidity and mortality as well as a major health impact. Currently, spread of the disease involves close contact with pigs. However, aerosolization may be a possible bioterrorist method of dispersal.

What is thought to be the first outbreak of hantavirus causing HFRS was recorded in Russia in 1913. It is reported that Japanese troops in Manchuria experienced cases in 1932. In the early 1950s Western physicians recorded more than 3200 cases of an acute, debilitating, febrile illness in UN forces fighting in the Korean War. The illness, known as Korean hemorrhagic fever, affected soldiers living out of foxholes along the contested border between North and South Korea (Ricketts, 1954). Because the mortality rate was high (10\u201315%), the US Army Medical Department formed the Hemorrhagic Fever Commission to conduct an epidemiological investigation. Results of the commission indicated that a field mouse (Apodemus agrarius coreae) was harboring the infectious agent. However, it was not until 1977 that the infectious agent was isolated and named Hantaan for the river that runs near the 38th parallel, which separates North and South Korea (Lee et al., 2004). The Hemorrhagic Fever Commission preserved more than 600 serum samples from 245 soldiers. Later, in 1990, the serum samples from these 245 soldiers were screened for antibody to the Hantaan virus. Almost 40 years after the outbreak, investigators detected an antibody to Hantaan virus in 94% of the samples. In 1979 a virus similar to Hantaan caused hemorrhagic fever in laboratory workers. This virus, named Seoul virus after the site of the initial studies, infected Norway rats and roof rats shipped to Japan and Europe. Shipping these laboratory animals led to the dissemination of the Seoul virus.",

The region gets its name from the perfectly formed grid square that marks the boundaries among the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. These cases, later described as HPS, were attributed to a new species of hantavirus. Actually, nothing was new about it.

By June of that year, 12 people had succumbed to the illness. The illness was initially diagnosed as unexplained acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients presented with abrupt fever, severe headache, myalgia, and cough followed by rapidly progressive pulmonary edema (Stelzel, 1996). Within 2\u201310 days, this condition led to respiratory failure, hypotension, and death. New Mexico Public Health officials teamed with CDC investigators to set up surveillance and laboratory testing. The team found that serum from the patients showed cross-reactive antibodies to Hantaan, Seoul, and Puumala virus antigens. However, the condition in these patients had developed into a pulmonary form unlike any other clinical presentation of hantavirus infection. The investigation also focused on the wildlife and domestic animals in the area of the outbreak (Calisher et al., 1999). Epidemiologists were quick to discover that the virus was being spread through the dried feces and urine of Peromyscus mice. Unfortunately, the Navajo believe that mice are responsible for bringing seeds to the earth, which enables humans to survive. The fact that mice are highly respected in Navajo culture made disease control efforts difficult. Tribal members had to accept all forms of rodent population management efforts, which include trapping, housecleaning, and reduction of harborage.",

Conversely, heavy snowfall and spring rains allow plants to flourish and rodent populations to surge. These surges in the rodent population cause rodents to compete for food and protection in the dryer months that follow. The competition puts pressure on some infected rodents, forcing them into peridomestic environments, putting more people at risk for infection. HPS is most common in spring and summer months, when rodents are most active. Although the overall risk for HPS in endemic areas is relatively low, infections are associated with an increased population of rodents in and around the house. Activities that put people in contact with rodent droppings, urine, or nesting materials place the individual at higher risk for infection. Indoor exposures have been linked to rodents in the home or near dwellings, especially in colder months. Cleaning buildings that have been closed up for a period of time, such as cabins, barns, and storage facilities, also increases the risk of exposure.",

The second case was from a needle stick to a worker harvesting WNV-infected mouse brains. In 2002 WNV was found to be present in the blood supply. Twenty-three cases of WNV infection were due to infected blood components from 16 WNV-viremic blood donors. This finding prompted blood collection agencies to begin screening blood donations. The following year, 737 donor samples were found to be WNV positive, prompting blood bank officials to discard their donations. Despite the screening, two cases of confirmed blood transfusion\u2013associated West Nile fever were documented in 2003. Nationwide blood screening for WNV has been successful in preventing transfusion-transmitted WNV (Stramer et al., 2005). However, as with all blood donation screening, infections can be transmitted to transfusion recipients on rare occasions despite negative donor test results. Although WNV transmission by blood transfusion is rare, the few cases seen since 2002 underscore the importance of clinical recognition, effective WNV blood screening strategies, and investigation coordination (Pealer et al., 2003).",
