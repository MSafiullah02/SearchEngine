Publications with two or more authors affiliated to the same country were counted only once for the total number of collaborations of this particular country (Bruggmann et al. 2017c). If an author had two affiliations, these were counted for every country mentioned in the affiliations. Connecting vectors visualized these co-operations; their width and shade of grey reflected the number of joint publications (Bruggmann et al. 2017c).

A specific purpose of NewQIS was to combine these bibliometric parameters with visualization techniques in order to provide a picture of the global landscape of different research aspects. Among different available techniques, density-equalizing map projections (DEMP) were chosen. As elegantly described by Gastner and Newman, map makers searched for a long a way to generate cartograms, in which the sizes of countries appear in proportion to a chosen parameter such as their population (Gastner and Newman 2004). For the purpose of NewQIS, these maps could be used to visualize research activities. As stated by Gastner and Newman, in order to scale countries and still have them properly fit together, they need to be distorted, causing difficulties to read them. In 2004, a new method was proposed which was integrated to the NewQIS platform. With DEMPs being a part of NewQIS, the territories of countries were re-sized according to a particular variable, i.e. in proportion to the countries\u00b4 total number of published items regarding to a specific disease. Figure 3 shows examples of DEMPs published within NewQIS studies over the past decade. The distorted global landscape is usually characterized by a dominating USA and an enlarged European area as depicted in Fig. 3a for pulmonary hypertension research output (Gotting et al. 2017). However, there are also research areas in which also countries from other continental regions appear enlarged. This can be seen for snakebite envenoming research for Brazil as shown in Fig. 3b (Groneberg et al. 2016c). China\u2014a rising star in many areas of science\u2014does also appear in some NewQIS assessments prominently as shown for ovarian cancer research in Fig. 3c (Bruggmann et al. 2017d). Concerning Asian countries, a previous assessment of 5527,558 articles has indicated that Asian countries have largely different research focuses in comparison to Western countries (Groneberg-Kloft et al. 2008b). In order to assess changes over the time, spatiotemporal analyses can also be performed by merging to a video consisting of different density-equalizing mapping (Groneberg-Kloft et al. 2009e).",

Although producing global landscapes of research, it should never be forgotten that these pictures only delineate the research output which can be found in a specific data base (i.e. Web of Science) with a specific search term. Thus, all research not listed in the WoS and all research excluded by the search term (no search term can be absolutely perfect) is not included in the global landscape. This needs to be taken into account carefully when NewQIS results are interpreted. Especially the language bias constitutes an important problem: journals published in English have a higher chance of getting included to the data bases (Nieminen and Isohanni 1999). Thus, non-English speaking countries are underrepresented concerning their research activities and important but regional data such as regional epidemiologic data is not identified (Pleger et al. 2014).A further limitation that needs to be addressed is the above Matthew effect mentioned above: Communication systems in science are directed towards a reward of highly productive and renowned scientists and institutions. This leads to a pyramidal citation scheme (Merton 1968; Pleger et al. 2014).The so-called (semi-)qualitative indicators that are used in NewQIS are parameters such as the total citations, citation rate, country-specific h-index. They need to be interpreted very carefully. As already earlier critically discussed, they are not real measures for the quality of individual research (Pleger et al. 2014). In this respect, a recent study addressed the question if methodological quality and completeness of reporting are associated with citation-based measures of publication impact (Mackinnon et al. 2018). The authors performed a secondary analysis of a systematic review of dementia biomarker studies. They reported that citation rates and 5-year journal impact factors appear to measure different dimensions. While citation rates were weakly associated with completeness of reporting, none of these metrics was related to methodological rigor. They suggested that high publication usage and journal outlet is not a guarantee of quality and readers should critically appraise all papers regardless of presumed impact (Mackinnon et al. 2018). Therefore, qualitative aspects are better addressed by advanced meta-analysis approaches using i.e. Cochrane systematics (Stovold et al. 2014).",

However, it is the long term aim of NewQIS to analyze about 200 different areas within the next decade and to repeat assessments in 5- to 10-year intervals of important areas in order to assess changes in global research activities. When counting the raw data analyzed in the first 100 projects, we approximately invested about 50,000 work hours. Without extramural funding, this was only achievable by the workforce of medical students who performed their MD projects within NewQIS. In contrast to peer reviewed scientific reports which have been published for different NewQIS studies, a German medical thesis usually encompasses a much longer manuscript with 80\u2013100 pages. This has been achieved by the medical students by writing comprehensive introductions about the field of research they analyze within their thesis. Thereby, they demonstrate that they possess an extensive knowledge about their thesis project. This is a prerequisite to obtain an MD degree. Also, the thesis students have to write detailed descriptions of their methodological approach (the NewQIS techniques) in the methods sections of the thesis and they have to discuss limits of the methodology in the discussion sections of their thesis.",

This technical overlap is important and a strength of the platform in order to facilitate the comparison of results between the different diseases studied. However, it can be anticipated, that the use of these stringent protocols in nearly 80 different thesis projects\u2014all with different target areas, i.e. ranging from burnout syndrome (Fr\u00f6hlich 2009) to bronchial asthma (Puk 2009)\u2014brings the same problem as rewriting a passage on the methodology of other highly structured techniques such as RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) which has now been published more than 250,000 times according to the PubMed. As with nearly identical descriptions of PCR and other molecular biology methods which can be found in peer reviewed scientific papers, an overlapping wording does not represent an act of plagiarism but rather exemplifies the impossibility to reword a similar methods section for more than 80 times without overlapping sentences. This does also apply for the part of the discussion in which the methodology and its limitations are discussed. Addressing these issues, the international Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) points to a guideline of BioMed Central editors which outlines the following: \u201cUse of similar or identical phrases in methods sections where there are limited ways to describe a common method, (\u2026), is not uncommon. In such cases, an element of text recycling is likely to be unavoidable in further publications using the same method. Editors should use their discretion when deciding how much overlap of methods text is acceptable, considering factors such as whether authors have been transparent and stated that the methods have already been described in detail elsewhere and provided a citation\u201d (COPE) (https://publicationethics.org/text-recycling-guidelines). Therefore, to overcome this pitfall, peer-reviewed NewQIS studies cite previous studies because of the methodological similarities\u2014which are a strength of the platform. Also, thesis students are urged to cite every other NewQIS thesis which used the platform and to declare that the used methodology is part of NewQIS and therefore similar (apart from i.e. the different search terms).The introductions of the respective thesis usually follow the guidelines of up-to-date reviews i.e. on the disease which is analyzed for the thesis. In this respect, numerous introductions from NewQIS related thesis projects were also published as CME (continuing medical education) articles or as narrative reviews. Unfortunately, a recent analysis showed that within one thesis project, almost all parts of the introduction were copied by the student from the Wikipedia\u2014a case of severe plagiarism that led to the deprivation of the Dr. med. degree (MD Thesis) of the student (Sudik 2011). In order to prevent future cases of plagiarism, all medical thesis now need to be analyzed within a plagiarism check prior to the official submission of the thesis to the medical school.",
