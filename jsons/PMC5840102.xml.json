In addition, when combined with other fungal biomarkers in serum (either GM or BDG) or in BAL (GM), Aspergillus PCR has shown to increase the diagnostic sensitivity up to 100%, further supporting the implementation of this technique in the revised definition of invasive fungal infection by the EORTC/MSG. Experience with non-neutropenic patients is scarce, but the efficacy of molecular techniques seems to be similar to that for the population with hematological malignancies [43]. Another application of molecular biology techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis is the ability to detect azole-resistant strains earlier than do conventional methods [44].
