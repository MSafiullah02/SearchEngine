Being able to bring to bear pharmaceutical interventions to counteract its effects will represent a major turning point in the fight to turn the tides in this ongoing battle. Recently, the World's most powerful supercomputer, SUMMIT, was used to identify existing small molecule pharmaceuticals which may have the desired activity against SARS-CoV-2 through a high throughput virtual screening approach. In this communication, we demonstrate how the use of Bayesian optimization can provide a valuable service for the prioritisation of these calculations, leading to the accelerated identification of high-performing candidates, and thus expanding the scope of the utility of HPC systems for time critical screening.",

[12, 24] It has since become a global pandemic, impacting the economic, social and health systems of almost every country in the world. In a race to discover potential pharmaceutical interventions, some researchers have turned to high-throughput virtual screening as an avenue to prioritise the screening of existing commercially available or pharmainternal proprietary, compounds for activity against the virus. Screening at scale has been enabled by an unprecedented communal activity known as the COVID-19 HPC consortium [1] , which includes systems provided by It is anticipated that there will be high demand for the use of HPC resources such as are provided by the consortium, and so an ability to 'power up' smaller compute clusters to accelerate the (re-)discovery of pharmaceutical interventions through the use of in silico methods could prove very valuable. In this paper we propose the use of Bayesian optimization as such a technology, and demonstrate its potential through a demonstration on an early dataset collected on the IBM SUMMIT supercomputer by Smith, et al.

[15] For some problems, however, the urgency of the outcome dictates that a scale of computing and performance currently not yet feasible in the cloud be used. One such example of this is the work of Jeremy Smith et al, who used the world's fastest supercomputer, Summit [2] to screen over 8,000 known biologically active compounds, including many approved drug compounds, for potential activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus through a study of their binding of the ACE-2 receptor.

[13] At a high level, the algorithm follows a relatively simple flow, which is shown in Figure 1 . The lack of access to analytical forms is mitigated through the use of a probabilistic surrogate model, often a Gaussian process [22, 3] although other Bayesian models can be used.

Additionally drop off in the number of molecules displaying a desirable VINA scores is more marked for the Isolated S-protein target than for the Combined S-protein-ACE2 interface target. Intuititvely, therefore, it is unreasonable to expect a randomly drawn subset of these molecules to display strong potential as candidates against SARS-CoV-2. By comparing the distribution of a subset of the overall sets which correspond to desirable VINA scores against the distrubtion of molecules selected by the Bayesian PDTS sampler, we can determine the 'enrichment' the Bayesian sampler offers. Here, we plot the 'mean fraction of sample' as a scoring metric. This is simply the mean value (over the five runs for PDTS) of the fraction of the sample which would be placed within this bin. This is compared to the fraction which is observed within these bins for the full set of molecules. The fact that in all cases, the blue bar (representing the PDTS approach) is greater than the orange bar (representing the overall distribution) demonstrates the effectiveness of the PDTS methodology to draw enriched sets of molecules for testing, and is further proof of the efficiency of the Bayesian optimization methodology to prioritise tasks for HVTS. Table 1 indicates numerically the performance of the PDTS algorithm for these three tasks. It can be seen than on every task the PDTS method of Bayesian optimization outperforms random sampling and thus shows great potential for the efficient prioritisation of HTVS testing of pharmaceuticals for activity against SARS-CoV-2. This is both demonstrated by the ability of the PDTS sampler to efficiently locate the global optima in the two tasks, but also to do so reliably -as indicated by the low standard deviations over runs. We also demonstrate the ability of the PDTS sampler to create enriched samples on limited budgets, which was demonstrated by the greater scores in both the Top10 average test, and the Top 'Bin' percentage test. Again, both of these tests display reasonable standard deviations across runs, demonstrating the reproducibility of the methodology. Table 1 : Overall results of the three metrics for investigation as to the potential for Bayesian optimization to act as an efficient prioritisation engine for HTVS. For 'Percentage in top bin', the 'Random' value refers to the overall percentage, rather then a particular random sample. For 'Best VINA' and 'Top10' metrics, PDTS and random results are averaged over 5 runs, with the standard deviation of those runs also being reported.",

Indeed, the no-free-lunch theorem says that there is not one globally guaranteed optimal methodology existing, anyway. We have shown in the past [18] that Bayesian optimization offers significant benefits over a greedy methodology, which is prone to catastrophic local optimization, and so we do not seek to reproduce those results here. What this study demonstrates is that, for problems which are both time critical and compute intensive, Bayesian optimization (specifically here the PDTS algorithm) have significant benefits when applied to HTVS screens. With a global problem such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, speed to solution is necessary, but must also be tempered with a pragmatic approach to resource allocation. There are simply not enough SUMMIT supercomputers in the world for everyone who might want to use them. Here, we demonstrate that for the challenge attempted by Smith, et al. for determining a set of molecules for further investigation using the HTVS methodology, promising results could be reached with a smaller compute cluster, if paired with a prioritisation mechanism powered by Bayesian optimization.",
