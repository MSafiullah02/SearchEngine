            "text": "Cutoff point determination and system suitability controls: Cutoff point should refl ect biological variations among noninfected turkeys in the fi eld in order to differentiate the infected samples with positive results. With IFA remains as the gold standard for detection of TCoV antibody in the fi eld, it is an appropriate approach to set up cutoff point based on IFA positive and negative populations. Some acceptable approaches are discussed below for considerations. Logistic regression analysis: ELISA value of serum samples from the fi eld turkey fl ocks as positive or negative for TCoV by IFA are compared. The cutoff point is calculated from the logistic equation ln[ P /(1 \u2212 P )] = \u03b21 X + \u03b20, where X is the ELISA value. At the optimum cutoff point of the ELISA value, the probability of the sample being negative ( P ) would be the same as the probability of the sample being positive (1 \u2212 P ), i.e., P = 1 \u2212 P = 0.5 or 50 %. The cutoff point is determined by solving 0 = \u03b21 X + \u03b20 for X (ln[0.5/ (1 \u2212 0.5)] = ln(1) = 0). Logistic regression is used to estimate the coeffi cients \u03b21 and \u03b20. Statistical computations are performed using SAS program. The sample numbers ( N ) of IFA positive and negative population should be at least 30. IFA negative population: ELISA values of serum samples ( N \u2265 30) from the fi eld turkey fl ocks as negative for TCoV by IFA are populated. Outliers are removed by statistical methods such as Box-plot. Mean and standard deviation (SD) of ELISA values are calculated from the remaining samples. Cutoff point can be calculated for 95 % confi dence interval as mean plus 1.645 SD (mean + 1.645 \u00d7 SD) for an estimated 5 % false positive rate.",
