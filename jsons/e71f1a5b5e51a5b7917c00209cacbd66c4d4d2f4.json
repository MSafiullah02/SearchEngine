Defining life has challenged and divided biologists and philosophers alike ever since Aristotle proposed the first definition. Emerging fields like synthetic biology and exobiology have rekindled attempts at establishing a definition of life for practical purposes. The question presents many challenges with each attempt thus far leading to unintended implications and strong counterexamples. It is an inherently multidisciplinary challenge with each approach giving wildly varying and often irreconcilable definitions. The given definitions of life are numerous with over 300 definitions published in books and journals. The unique characteristics of the mimivirus, discovered in 2003, and later giant viruses, rekindled the discussion in defining life, indicating other complications in a definition.",

There are fields within biology that require a working definition of life for publishing (Cleland and Chyba, 2002) . For example, exobiology is concerned with the study of life beyond the Earth, but the search for extraterrestrial life needs to distinguish between inanimate and living entities (Oliver and Perry, 2006) . When studying the origin of life, researchers can use model chemical systems to simulate how life may have begun on the Earth. Some definition of life is needed to show the transition from inanimate molecules to biological systems (van Hateren, 2013) . Finally, the field of artificial life (Alife) aims to fully simulate living organisms electronically. Researchers in this field need a definition of life to understand what properties are essential for something to be living and thus improve their simulations (Machery, 2012) .",

Many researchers instead want a 'theory of living systems' that can fully describe life's origins and characteristics rather than setting a concrete definition of life (Cleland and Chyba, 2002) . Dictionary definitions define a word's usage in a particular language, whereas researchers are interested in the nature of life itself, which cannot be encapsulated in one strict definition (Szostak, 2012) . Since we are still discovering new species and have competing hypotheses for how life originated, many feel that the issue of defining the concept of 'life' is a worthless pursuit as we do not understand enough about it (Raoult, 2009; Szostak, 2012 Szostak, ). 2004 ). This was an observational attempt that was unchallenged until the synthesis of cell theory by Schwann and Schleiden in 1855. The basic tenets was that all life are formed of cells, which are created from pre-existing cells, and that cells are the smallest unit of life. This immediately excluded viruses and all non-cellular life forms (which at the time had not been discovered) from the definition. As cell theory became universally accepted, the definition of life being strictly cellular was also accepted (Wolfe, 1972) .",

Although they interacted with cells causing major diseases, they were treated as transferable toxins rather than living organisms as cell theory dictates (Forterre, 2010) . In 1967, the virologist and Nobel laureate Andre Lwoff used the definition 'an integrated system of interdependent structures and functions' and 'an organism is constituted of cells' (Forterre, 2010) , emphasizing the distinct and controlled nature of organelles inside cells. This is analogous to the organization of organs in multicellular organisms. This definition also conforms to the tenets of cell theory even though Lwoff was himself a virologist. However, this definition was criticized as it could include machines like cars or AI which have interdependent circuits (Oliver and Perry, 2006) .",

This definition was well received by his contemporaries as each of these criteria allow for flexibility, meaning that it is usable in a variety of contexts (Zhuravlev and Avetiso, 2006) .

This novel approach sidestepped the history and debate of defining life and attempted to find common ground within the Biological disciplines.

He wrote considerably on experiments with selfreplicating RNA in his paper (Trifonov, 2011) , which led to critics to suggest that this was a more Earth-centric practical definition rather than a holistic one (Trifonov, 2012) . Trifonov himself partially showed this as he envisaged later molecular origin-of-life experiments to prove this definition and approach (Trifonov, 2011) . He also pointed to a practical use for this definition for molecular experiments such as GCC n repeats replication errors in the origin-of-life field (Pino, Trifonov and Di Mauro, 2011) . More noticeable is the fact that Trifonov's definition is almost exactly the same as that of Alexander Oparin, who proposed the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis for how the early atmosphere could have produced molecules leading to life (Oparin, 1924) . As a consequence, critics were sceptical of his claim that this approach could be used universally (Popa, 2012) .",

Many advances in science have come from challenging past conventional wisdom and this approach may not represent competing viewpoints in fast moving fields (Popa, 2012) . There are still competing hypotheses for the origin of life (Altstein, 2015) and so this approach could not represent all viewpoints, only the hypothesis that received the most attention in the literature (Popa, 2012) . There were also many minor criticisms of his methodology as Trifonov grouped together words with similar meaning (Trifonov, 2012) . The classification of these groups invited controversy notably from biochemists, who argued that metabolism should be grouped in the 'System' and not 'Chemical' category (Trifonov, 2012) . There were also criticisms of the words within the groups, for example, 'force' and 'energy' were grouped together and so were 'replication' and 'selfreproduction' (Trifonov, 2012) . Many critics pointed out that these had different definitions and that grouping them together made the overall definition less accurate (Trifonov, 2012) . Trifonov did acknowledge their concerns but stressed that there had to be some middle ground otherwise no consensus would be reached (Trifonov, 2012) . Moreover, as all these definitions were synthesized at different times, they were based on varying levels of knowledge about life. This meant that many definitions were outdated or had later been made redundant and diluted the more knowledgeable recent definitions (Trifonov, 2012) , especially when considering artificial life, knowledge of which is far more recent.",

There are difficulties with a theoretical definition as this requires a robust theory of living organisms that we do not yet have. Biologists are asking for a definition that can (i) apply to all life forms across the past, present and future, (ii) be descriptive enough to discriminate between ambiguous cases on a case-by-case basis without any counterexamples, (iii) state the universal but essential elements of all life forms and (iv) be linguistically unambiguous (Zhuravlev and Avetiso, 2006) .

The term 'self-sustaining' has implications, as a lone sexually reproducing organism is treated as not living, whereas a mating pair is (Koshland, 2002) . Therefore, lone sexually reproducing organisms cannot be considered as self-sustaining. Chemical systems can also be capable of error prone reproduction but need constant monitoring so cannot be self-sustaining (Benner, 2010) . However for origin-of-life researchers, these systems are considered as living. Finally, it is problematic from a practical standpoint to determine whether a system is capable of Darwinian evolution as this requires studies over many generations and under different selection pressures (Oliver and Perry, 2006) .",

In the first instance, we assume that people's collective judgements on what is living or not can lead to a definition. However there is a strong evidence both in psychology and empirically that folk concepts are not strict definitions and that people's collective judgements are too contradictory to lead to one definition (Machery, 2012) . In this case, Machery argues that trying to define life is impossible. Treating life as a theoretical concept is also problematic as different fields try to define life according to an agenda. Figure 1 illustrates this problem as this leads to varying working definitions of life that aid one field but with little or no overlap with others (Machery, 2012) . In this case, defining life universally is unnecessary as there are practical definitions already available.",

This suggests that they have co-evolved with cellular life as far back as the LUCA according to the same rules of Darwinian evolution (Forterre, 2010) . This is corroborated by the fact that every cell can be infected by at least one virus and viruses are the most abundant life forms on the Earth with an estimated 10 30 viruses in the ocean alone (Suttle, 2007) .

The virologist Andre Lwoff observed that viruses transform the whole infected cell into a virion factory (Lwoff, 1967) . The virion factory (also called viroplasm or virus induced inclusion bodies) is the apparatus where new viral particles are assembled in the host and can be seen as a large organelle-like structure in the cytoplasm or nucleus (Neuman, Angelini and Buchmeier, 2014; Risco, Fernandez and Sanz-Sanchez, 2014) . Virion factories usually have single or double membranes either taken from the host plasma membrane or made from lipids redirected from the endoplasmic reticulum (Neuman, Angelini and Buchmeier, 2014; Risco, Fernandez and Sanz-Sanchez, 2014) . Virion factories show properties of cellular life such as 'metabolism, growth and reproduction'. Therefore, life is effectively present (Bandea, 1983) . In this view, the extracellular virions are inert but the intracellular virus seen as a virion factory is living (Bandea, 1983) . When this argument was first proposed in 1983, it was largely rejected by the scientific community as a biased attempt by virologists to classify their studied organism as living (Forterre, 2010) .",

            "text": "This virus had some novel characteristics that had previously only been found in cellular organisms. First, it was bigger than many cellular organisms in diameter (750 nm) and was the first to be visible under a light microscope. Its genome was large too at 1.2 Mb and with 911 functional protein coding genes, far beyond that needed for a viral life cycle (Claverie, 2006) . Since viruses need only code for their own capsid, receptors for host entry and hijacking the cell, they had not been expected to carry more than around 200 genes (Claverie, 2006) . Moreover, viral genomes are limited by the structural instability of large amounts of naked DNA. This suggests that the virus was using other genes for purposes other than a typical viral life cycle, otherwise these extra genes would have been lost through evolution (Claverie, 2006) . The non-coding regions were also interesting as they had unique and strongly conserved promotor elements, hinting to the fact that this was a part of a long lineage existing at the same time as the first cells (Claverie and Abergel, 2009 ). This notion is supported by more recent proteome analysis that concluded that viruses originated from ancient cells that had segmented RNA genomes (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015) . These RNA cells coexisted with the ancestors of the last universal modern ancestor (LUCA). Due to the selection pressure of genome and particle sizes these RNA cells eventually became viruses and became similar to parasitic bacteria that had similar pressures (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015) . The nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses which include the mimivirus form one paraphyletic group that diverged at varying times before the emergence of modern Archaea and Eukaryotes (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015) . Second, it possessed many genes that had only been previously found in cellular organisms, such as eukaryotic transcription factors and RNA synthesis that are essential for translation. All these genes were fully functional when expressed and performed just as well as those found in cells (Claverie and Abergel, 2009 ). This went against the conventional belief that viruses are reliant on the infected host for translation machinery. However, as it does not code for its own ribosomes it still requires a host to synthesize proteins so is not free living.",

In fact, the mimivirus viral factory is membrane bound and can take up huge volumes inside the cell, setting it apart from other viral factories (Forterre, 2010) . This rekindled the argument made by Bandea (Bandea, 1983) , emphasizing the fact that the viral factory is the virus organism itself, with the virions that are produced being vectors for this organism to be spread to other cells (Claverie, 2006) . This argument was extended to say that during the life cycle the whole infected cell becomes a virus and because of this we should consider viruses as both living and 'a particular form of cellular organism' (Forterre, 2010) , with the proviso that they borrow from the cell they infect. The virion factory is also very similar to some intracellular parasitic bacteria such as Rickettsia buchnera, which also depend on the host metabolism to reproduce and are unanimously counted as living (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015) . This metaphor can be extended to say that the virion and a host can be viewed as two gametes that fuse to create the virion factory, which then creates more virion progeny (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015) . This metaphor has been used to depict viruses as living (Hegde et al., 2009 ).",

Another notable giant virus discovery is the Turpanvirus, which was found in Brazil and had all the translational machinery required apart from the ribosome.

The reasoning behind this is that nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) are an ancient lineage that have interacted with the earliest cells and may have predated them (Claverie and Abergel, 2009 ). There are some strongly supported phylogenetic trees that put the NCLDVs between Eukaryotes and archaea in a fourth domain (Br\u00fcssow, 2009; Boyer et al. 2010) . It has also been noted that traditional phylogenies were based on ribosomal proteins and were not representative of life as they precluded viruses (Boyer et al. 2010; Forterre, 2010) . However, Boyer et al. (2010) analysed transcription factors and RNA polymerase proteins, which are found more universally across cellular life and viruses.",

Two virologists proposed a new classification with the highest division being between organisms containing ribosomes and those containing capsids (Forterre, 2010) . Subviral entities like plasmids, prions and viroids (Kejnovskya and Trifonov, 2016) were grouped together as 'orphan replicons' but separate from this tree (Forterre, 2010) . However, this overhaul of taxonomy led to criticism that it was a stunt to gain more academic attention and an ungrounded attempt to class viruses as living. There were other issues such that all ribosome-encoding organisms contained common rRNA proteins but there was no protein universally shared in the capsid-encoding organisms (Forterre, 2010) . The authors acknowledged that this would incite controversy but emphasized the need to promote more academic debate on this subject (Forterre, 2010) .",
