The mobile ECMO team was composed by a specialized intensivist, a thoracic surgeon and a trained perfusion nurse. A roster was started in order to make the team available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Decision to initiate ECMO treatment was always a multi-consultant decision. The ECMO team was able to reach any hospital of the region in less than 45 minutes (by road or by air depending on the weather). The ECMO team decided on arrival to retrieve the patient on conventional ventilation or to initiate ECMO on site and transfer the patient on ECMO support. Patients under ECMO were admitted in a specialized ICU with trained staff. The Cardiohelp\u00ae (Maquet Medical system, Wayne, USA) ECMO device was used for each transport because of its compact and light design (10kg).",

The ECMO team initiated 8 veno-venous ECMO treatments on site and transferred 3 patients on conventional ventilation. For all patients, the drainage cannula (size of 25 Fr) was inserted in the right femoral vein and the return cannula (size of 19 Fr) was inserted in the right jugular vein. Heparin treatment was started after the procedure with continuous perfusion of unfractioned heparin for an anti-XA level target of 0,2-0,4 UI.ml\u22121. Despite this treatment, canula thrombosis occurred for 2 patients leading to procedure failure and death of the patients. This is probably due to the high inflammatory state that increases the risk of thrombosis as suggested in some reports.4 The ECMO team was not available 3 times due to simultaneous calls. Only one ECMO was initiated during night shift. Four patients (50%) were discharged from ICU. Characteristics, outcomes and complications of patients were detailed in table 1\n. The role of ECMO in covid-19-related ARDS is still unclear. To date, only limited case-series are available. Our report is in accordance with previous reports on limited cases-series of Covid-19 patients under ECMO support. Li et al. reported a similar rate of 50% of weaning for 8 patients under ECMO.5 Jacobs et al. in a larger case-series of 32 covid-19 patients under ECMO, have a weaning rate of 16% (5/32) but the majority of their ECMO treatment were still ongoing at time of publication.6 To the contrary to other team, we performed only veno-venous ECMO therapies as all treated patients were hemodynamically stable without acute ventricular dysfunction.7\n",
