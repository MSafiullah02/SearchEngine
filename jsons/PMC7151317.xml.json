Through engagement with the public, governments can develop citizens\u2019 understanding of their actions and self-resilience in crisis response, as well as increasing the capabilities of government agencies in processing crisis information and providing public services (Chatfield & Reddick, 2018; del Mar G\u00e1lvez-Rodr\u00edguez, Haro-de-Rosario, Garc\u00eda-Tabuyo, & Caba-P\u00e9rez, 2019; Graham, Avery, & Park, 2015; Stark & Taylor, 2014). Citizen engagement refers to the involvement of citizens in public affairs, with the aim of building trusted relationships beyond simple information exchange. Governments that take a holistic approach to citizen engagement, embedding public participation into political activities such as public policy discussions, enhance understanding and promote transparent decision-making (Agostino & Arnaboldi, 2016; Taylor & Kent, 2014). Social media, due to its openness, dialogism, and participatory nature, offers significant benefits in delivering synchronous and interactive communication between governments and citizens, bringing new impetus to citizen engagement (Agostino & Arnaboldi, 2016; Bons\u00f3n, Perea, & Bedn\u00e1rov\u00e1, 2019).",

Local government agencies in the United Kingdom used Twitter functions e.g., hashtags and mentions, to interact with the general public to realize government-public cooperation in clarifying rumors and identifying suspects during the 2011 riots (Panagiotopoulos, Bigdeli, & Sams, 2014). Indonesian government agencies used Twitter for cooperative production with citizens to deliver early warning messages during the 2012 Tsunami, improving their efficiency in public information services (Chatfield, Scholl, & Brajawidagda, 2013). In the United States, during the 2012 Hurricane Sandy crisis, government agencies used Twitter to engage citizens in public services development (Chatfield & Reddick, 2018), although they selectively engaged stakeholders, including citizens, peer government departments, and media agencies (Liu & Xu, 2019).",

Firstly, most government agencies still regard social media as a complementary channel for disseminating information, rather than a tool for promoting citizen engagement (Neely & Collins, 2018; Wukich, 2016). Government agencies use their accounts to release information about updates and guidelines, but few employ participative strategies to promote citizen-government collaboration and engagement (Neely & Collins, 2018; Wukich, 2016). The two-way interactive communication through Government Social Media (GSM) stays on the surficial level, such as limited comments and inadequate dialogue (Tang, Zhang, Xu, & Vo, 2015). Secondly, government agencies may experience challenges in using social media for citizen engagement, including the digital divide, reliability and accountability, vague organizational strategies, lack of sufficient resources and formal policies, privacy, and security issues (Elbanna, Bunker, Levine, & Sleigh, 2019; Harrison & Johnson, 2019). The efficiency of social media for communicating crisis information is also a cause for concern (Roy, Hasan, Sadri, & Cebrian, 2020, p. 102060).",

Crisis events include natural and technical disasters, terrorist attacks, international conflicts, nuclear threats, civil unrest, and global pandemics (Pan & Meng, 2016; Rosenthal et al., 1991). Effective crisis management requires timely communication and coordination between government agencies and stakeholders (Elbanna et al., 2019; Reddy et al., 2009); however, crises are often dynamic and complex, which causes many difficulties, such as extensive bureaucracy, policy-related constraints, and lack of resources (Harrison & Johnson, 2019; Panagiotopoulos et al., 2014; Reddy et al., 2009). ICTs are one effective method for dealing with these challenges (Reddy et al., 2009). Social media has emerged as an important medium for governments and citizens to capture and explain crisis situations, make public decisions, and take action accordingly (Panagiotopoulos, Barnett, Bigdeli, & Sams, 2016). Government agencies in various countries have used social media to perform crisis communication and management (Chatfield & Reddick, 2018).",

Bons\u00f3n and Ratkai (2013) put forward the index of stakeholder engagement through social media, which attracted widespread concern. They argued that the social media engagement index is the sum of popularity, commitment and virality (Bons\u00f3n & Ratkai, 2013). The three dimensions are respectively calculated by indicators such as the number of likes, followers, shares, reposts and total posts (Bons\u00f3n & Ratkai, 2013); this citizen engagement index has been widely used in follow-up studies (Agostino & Arnaboldi, 2016; Bons\u00f3n & Bedn\u00e1rov\u00e1, 2018; Bons\u00f3n et al., 2019; Bons\u00f3n, Royo, & Ratkai, 2015; Bons\u00f3n, Royo, & Ratkai, 2017; del Mar G\u00e1lvez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2019; Denkta\u015f-\u015eakar and S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc, 2018). Some studies directly consider comments, likes and shares as the three dimensions of social media engagement (Brubaker & Wilson, 2018; Kim & Yang, 2017). There are also studies that use the sum of likes, comments and shares to measure citizen engagement (Jiang & Beaudoin, 2016).",

Only one study by del Mar G\u00e1lvez-Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2018) employed the DCT to investigate citizen engagement through the Facebook accounts of local Latin American governments; their results confirmed that the generation of new visits, dialogic loop and information of interest to stakeholders, which belongs to the principles of DCT, promotes citizen engagement (the weighted statistics of likes, shares, comments and posts). However, no studies have revealed the specific influencing mechanism by considering moderating variables.

Media richness refers to the potential information load of communication media, emphasizing the abilities of promoting shared meanings (Daft & Lengel, 1986). The judgment criteria of media richness include feedback timeliness, multiple clues, language diversity, and personal focus (Daft, Lengel, & Trevino, 1987). Daft et al. (1987) further illustrated the four types of media richness from top to bottom, namely: face-to-face communication, telephone, written documents, and unprocessed documents. The theory emphasizes that higher media richness is not always better; this depends on the specific content of organizational task (Daft et al., 1987). In other words, the best effects can be obtained when the media richness matches the task. Nowadays, developments new media technology enables people to create, communicate, and use multimedia content more easily. Content posted on social media is usually presented in plain text, pictures or videos, while their media richness varies from low to high (Denkta\u015f-\u015eakar and S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc, 2018; Yue, Thelen, Robinson, & Men, 2019). Due to word limit, Twitter users usually extend what they want to express by including complementary material, such as images or videos (Lee & Xu, 2018).",

In recent years, the theory has been applied to studies on citizen engagement on social media. Dialogic communication refers to the negotiated interchange of ideas and opinions (Wirtz & Zimbres, 2018). Dialogue often follows two principles, namely: the realization of mutual satisfaction, and the creation of common meaning (Wirtz & Zimbres, 2018). Kent and Taylor (1998) stated that dialogic communication must follow five principles to achieve success: (1) Dialogic loop, meaning that the organization which posts content to social can stimulate public dialogue, providing the dialogue channel for the public and responding to public feedback in a timely manner; (2) Usefulness of Information, meaning that the contributing organization should provide useful content for visitors, creating both organizational benefits and public benefits; (3) Generation of Return Visits, which emphasizes not only the strategy used to refresh daily content, but also the public question patterns and online forums; (4) Intuitiveness/Ease of the Interface, emphasizing that the design and structure of websites must be convenient for users to search and find information; and (5) Rule of Conservation of Visitors, emphasizing that we should attach importance to website visitors and limit the amount of external links and advertisement. The DCT and its five principles have been used to study social media mediated communication since 2009 (Wirtz & Zimbres, 2018). Rybalko and Seltzer (2010) first used the DCT to investigate how Fortune 500 Companies use Twitter to stimulate stakeholder engagement.",

            "text": "Existing studies regarding the relationship between media richness and citizen engagement through social media have focused predominantly on the specific dimension of citizen engagement (likes, shares or retweets, and comments), but the results reported are controversial. Although most studies support the assumption that multimedia content receives more likes (Bhattacharya et al., 2017; Bons\u00f3n et al., 2019; Brubaker & Wilson, 2018; Ji, Chen, Tao, & Li, 2019; Lee & Xu, 2018) and shares (Bons\u00f3n et al., 2019; Brubaker & Wilson, 2018; Ji et al., 2019; Kim & Yang, 2017; Lee & Xu, 2018; Xu & Zhang, 2018; Yue et al., 2019), some have also confirmed the positive effect of plain text. For example, Lee and Xu (2018) analyzed 1575 tweets from the official Twitter accounts of Donald Trump and Bill Clinton during the 2016 US president election. They found that plain text tweets by Trump's account were most popular with tweets including pictures having no effect on the number of likes and shares received. In addition, videos were observed to have no influence on shares, but greatly reduced the number of likes (Lee & Xu, 2018). Visual text had no impact on the number of shares, but decreased the number of likes significantly (Lee & Xu, 2018). The authors inferred that people seem more interested in the unpredictable and instant messages compared with the visual elements of Twitter (Lee & Xu, 2018). Xu and Zhang (2018) analyzed 13,322 tweets about #MH370, the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disaster, and found that the number of words contained in each post influenced the number of shares significantly. Research into 50 Facebook accounts of local governments in Western Europe showed that pictures were most likely to promote citizen engagement (calculated by the number of followers, likes, retweets, and posts), followed by plain text (Bons\u00f3n et al., 2015).",

However, the influence of pictures and videos on overall citizen engagement and its three dimensions remain debated. Some studies support the premise that pictures increase the number of comments received (Ji et al., 2019), while others find that they reduce comments (Kim & Yang, 2017). Rahim et al. (2019) analyzed 2132 photos posted on the Malaysian Health Department official Facebook page confirming that pictures had no significant effect on citizen engagement rates (calculated by likes, comments and shares). Contrarily, Rahim et al. (2019) found that videos improved citizen engagement rates, but there are other studies that argue that videos cause no effect (Denkta\u015f-\u015eakar and S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc, 2018). There is more controversy about the impact of videos on the three dimensions of citizen engagement. Kim and Yang (2017) analyzed 600 posts on 20 Facebook accounts owned by companies and found that videos had no influence on the number of likes and comments, but did increase the number shares. However, Ji et al. (2019) found that videos increased likes and shares, while comments decreased. The analysis of Facebook posts of the top 20 respectful and controversial companies indicated that videos will increase shares but have no influence on the number likes and comments\uff08Kim & Yang, 2017). Moreover, Chung (2017) used content analysis to analyze 1018 tweets relating to Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and confirmed that the negative impact of videos on shares was not significant.",

            "text": "In summary, combined with the following three points, this study argues that media richness will negatively impact citizen engagement on GSM: (1) Citizens are more concerned with whether GSM information can satisfy their needs and reduce uncertainty during times of crisis. Hong, Fu, Wu, and Frias-Martinez (2018) identified that citizens living in different areas of Maryland, USA, had different information demands during natural disasters, while the degree of matching between demand and supply determined the online communication effects between government and citizens. During crises, citizens turn to leaders and expect governments to provide prompt and accurate information (Bakker, van Bommel, Kerstholt, & Giebels, 2019). Xie, Qiao, Shao, and Chen (2017) analyzed citizens' information sharing behaviors on Sina Weibo in the context of Chinese public crises; they found that citizens were most interested in receiving information about the government's handling of the crisis and its developments. Therefore, according to the Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986, pp. 141\u2013172), individuals are more prone to adopt the central path pattern to deal with information, which is focused on the message's content rather than peripheral clues, such as pictures or videos. (2) Compared with text-only posts, content that includes pictures or videos tend to have fewer words, which often impairs the completeness of information clues (Xu & Zhang, 2018). Existing evidence supports the assumption that long sentences can obtain more shares (Xu & Zhang, 2018). In addition, although multimedia content can provide supplemental information, citizens must pay greater effort due to the limitation of microblog platform technologies. Further, citizens are required to conduct extra procedures, including a greater number of clicks (Chung, 2017; Denkta\u015f-\u015eakar and S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc, 2018). (3) According to the MRT, media richness should be matched with specific contexts and tasks to achieve the best effects; if the application of high media richness is not matched with the tasks, poor results will be reached (Daft et al., 1987; Daft & Lengel, 1986).H1Media richness negatively predicts CEGSM.\n",

Social media engagement is often viewed as an organization's interaction with stakeholders through official social media accounts (Taylor & Kent, 2014). Engagement is a state of interaction that represents the relationship, providing and receiving between the organization and citizens (Taylor & Kent, 2014). It intends to promote mutual understanding, shared decision making and co-creation (Taylor & Kent, 2014). The public's enthusiasm for interaction is reflected in their investment of time and energy beyond requirements, to actively share and respond to content posted by organizations (Men, Tsai, Chen, & Ji, 2018). Therefore, the extent to which an organization's social media accounts implement the dialogic loop is an important account factor that affects citizen engagement.",

According to the Use and Gratification Theory, active audiences use different media exposure based on personal needs due to environmental and personal reasons (Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1973). Personal satisfaction with media will directly determine their subsequent media usage (Katz et al., 1973). Audiences usually have different individual needs during public health crises. Wang, Wang, Ye, Zhu, and Lee (2016) analyzed 706,835 posts relating to the 2012 Beijing Rainstorm and found that information about transportation, weather, loss, and rescue was most relied upon. Xie et al. (2017) found that during public crisis events, the most needed information was the disposition of the government. They further divided information requirements into three types, namely, supervising the government, seeking for truth, and caring for self-interest. The study also confirmed that information requirements which supervise the government will actively influence the sharing behaviors. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:H3Content type will have significantly differentiated effects on CEGSM.\n",

Corporate social media usually delivers posts with emotion to attract audience attention and facilitate conversations and a sense of online community (Ji et al., 2019). According to the Social Sharing of Emotion Theory, people who experience emotions are often eager to share and talk more urgently (Rim\u00e9, 2009). Emotion will trigger the social sharing of emotion: individuals will openly talk about the specific environment where the emotional event occurred and their own feelings and emotional response with others, or they will share their own emotions by way of letters, journals and other indirect methods (Rim\u00e9, 2009). Individuals can regulate their own emotional status through emotional sharing (Rim\u00e9, 2009). When individuals are exposed to emotional content on social media, they are likely to share their emotions and this further promotes their engagement behaviors, such as sharing, liking and commenting (Ji et al., 2019; So et al., 2016). Previous studies have agreed that emotional posts facilitate citizens' social media engagement behaviors (Ji et al., 2019; Keib, Himelboim, & Han, 2018; Kivran-Swaine & Naaman, 2011; So et al., 2016).

Existing literature supports the motion that emotional valence has a significant influence on citizen engagement, but conclusions are debated. Zavattaro et al. (2015) indicated that government agencies like to release posts with positive emotions to encourage citizen engagement, and that citizens prefer to interact with government Twitter accounts which deliver posts containing positive emotion. Tang et al. (2019) analyzed 97,205 records from 30 provincial police micro-blogs and found that content with positive emotions was more likely to be shared, while posts containing negative emotions decreased the amount of sharing. Xu and Zhang (2018) demonstrated that tweets with positive emotions can increase the level of retweets, but content showing anger reduced those retweets. Regarding the three dimensions of citizen engagement, the effects of positive emotions are often different. Ji et al. (2019) concluded that positive emotion increases likes and comments, but reduces the number of shares. However, other studies have revealed that both positive and negative emotions promote news sharing on Facebook and Twitter, but that positive emotions outweigh negative emotions (Trilling, Tolochko, & Burscher, 2017). Current research argues that the impact of emotional valence on social media engagement depends on the specific communication environment, and that citizens will avoid risks by sharing negative contents under uncertainty and risky situations (Ji et al., 2019).",

Other dialogic features, such as the mention function @, are less likely to be used for enhancing interaction. For media richness, nearly 43 percent of posts (n = 606) used photos to deliver information, while 442 posts were only presented in the form of plain text. Videos (25.7%, n = 363) appeared least in all posts. Furthermore, the emotional valence of the posts was positive on average (M = 0.77, SD = 0.20).",

As Fig. 4\nshows, dialogic loop is negatively associated with CEGSM when the post contains negative emotions. Fig. 5\nillustrates that the engagement gap between posts with positive emotion and negative emotion only significantly exists in information relating to latest news.

Their research into Donald Trump's Twitter account showed that the improvisation and unpredictability of his tweets made the plain text more popular, while using pictures was not a predictor for liking and retweeting. The inclusion of video has no effect on the amount of retweeting but significantly reduces the number of likes (Lee & Xu, 2018). Although many studies have supported the positive effect of media richness on citizen engagement via social media to different degrees, most have been conducted under normal situations (Bhattacharya et al., 2017; Bons\u00f3n et al., 2019; Guidry et al., 2019, pp. 1\u20139; Yue et al., 2019). This means that the impact of media richness on citizen engagement during uncertain conditions requires further investigation. The results also show that, in times of public health crisis, citizens care more about the textual content of a post, rather than whether it contains a picture or video. Meanwhile, matching between crisis-related information demand and supply directly determines the effect of online communication (Hong et al., 2018; Wukich & Mergel, 2015). This empirical study also reveals that posts with pictures and videos attached relating to the latest information on the pandemic still brings the most citizen engagement; this could attribute to the Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986, pp. 141\u2013172), in which the public are more likely to use a central path to process information, rather than focusing on the use of multimedia and other peripheral clues that are not pertinent to the content during crisis. Meanwhile, this study also supports the inferences by Chung (2017) and Denkta\u015f-\u015eakar and S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc, 2018 that the technical features of Weibo and Twitter require the public to click more often to get supplementary information with pictures or videos, thereby reducing citizen engagement.",

(2018) and Men et al. (2018). In fact, in order to facilitate the dialogue loop, more than 96% of the sample uses hashtags and nearly a quarter use forms of questioning when posting information. DCT states that successful online communication and dialogue depends on the implementation of five principles, including: usefulness of information, ease of interface, rule of conservation of visitors, generation of return visits, and dialogic loop (Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010). Among them, the first three relate to technology and design, while the last two relate to dialogue (Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010). A dialogue loop is a suitable starting point for eliciting a dialogue between organizations and the public. The dialogue loop makes it possible for the public to talk with the organization and for the organization to responds to public questions and concerns (Kent & Taylor, 1998). All these actions improve the relationship between the organization and the public and gradually promote citizen engagement (Kent & Taylor, 1998). During public health crises, government agencies actively interact with the public through a dialogue loop, demonstrating their concern for public interests, ideas, and suggestions; in response, the public feel concerned, valued, recognized, and perceive a sense of enhanced belonging to government agencies and their social media communities, which in turn becomes an important motivation for continued engagement (Wang & Yang, 2020).",

Compared with information appreciating frontline emergency services, information relating to the latest news on the pandemic, and information on the government's handling of the crisis lead to increased citizen engagement, which denotes that the public concern these two types of information most frequently to reduce potential risks and uncertainties. This result supports previous findings which claim that different types of content meet public demands in different ways, and the differences are directly reflected in the number of likes, retweets and comments (Keib et al., 2018; Lee & Xu, 2018; Wang et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2017). Furthermore, the study of Xie et al. (2017) also found that Chinese social media users pay more attention to government disposal information and the latest developmental information in times of crisis. They further confirmed that these information needs positively affect the sharing behavior of users. The U&G theory can be used to explain current findings, which have also been used by scholars in recent years to study citizen engagement through social media in public crises (Xie et al., 2017). It shows that active audiences will choose different media platforms according to their own needs, and that satisfaction with chosen media will in-turn affect their subsequent media choices and media usage (Katz et al., 1973). The public will have more continuous usage behaviors, including liking and reposting in public health crises, when their demands are met from GSM outlets. Consequently, government agencies should fully consider citizens' information needs to promote their engagement while adopting official social media channels.",

            "text": "Above all, this study confirms that emotional valence moderates the relationship between media richness, dialogic loop, content types, and CEGSM. In terms of media richness, when posts with both a high media richness and positive emotion are displayed, CEGSM increases, while posts with a high media richness and negative emotion decline CEGSM. For the dialogic loop, when posts contain negative emotions, CEGSM reduces. Regarding content type, when posts are related to the latest news about the pandemic, stronger negative emotions lead to increased CEGSM. This study proves that if government agencies fail to use emotional valence and media richness appropriately, high media richness may reduce CEGSM, which provides a novel perspective to explain the controversial relationship between media richness and social media engagement in existing research. Similarly, when governments adopt a dialogic loop strategy to promote CEGSM, the compatibility of emotional valence and dialogic loop deserve special attention. In addition, this study expands Keib et al.\u2019s (2018) conclusion that emotional presence has a moderating effect on the relationship of content types and retweeting behavior by affirming emotional valence as a moderating variable, especially the facilitating role of negative emotions in the relationship between posts related to specific content themes and CEGSM.",

First, government agencies should comprehensively use artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies to analyze public demand and their changes during different stages of crisis. Government social media can therefore satisfy the needs of citizens to the greatest extent through the releasing of customized crisis information. According to the U&G theory and the Media Dependence Theory, demand satisfaction will enhance the influence of government social media on the public, and the public will further rely on it as the main source of crisis information; this will all eventually promote CEGSM.",

Government agencies can take full advantage of social media functions, especially mentions @ and hashtags. Governments may post and respond to citizen questions to increase interactions with the public, so as to improve the level of engagement. In addition, government agencies should consider the impact of emotional valence when using the dialogic loop. For example, posts displaying positive emotions will promote CEGSM more through the dialogue loop.",

When latest news about the pandemic is released through GSM, the impact of plain text is no less than that of posts containing pictures or videos. Those posts displaying positive emotions can include more videos or pictures, while plain text is more suitable for posts with negative emotions.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. Although the quantitative indicators such as number of likes, retweets or reposts, and comments, have become representative standards for scholars to evaluate citizen engagement on social media, some studies suggest that more appropriated indicators beyond simply number of likes could be incorporated for the practical good (Men & Tsai, 2013). For example, Men and Tsai (2013) divided citizen engagement into passive content consumption and proactive content contribution in their research on social networking sites in China. Future research should concentrate on proactive engagement on GSM platforms, such as co-production with citizens. Secondly, this study focuses on the official Sina Weibo account of the National Health Commission of China; however, local GSM has also made considerable contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should deepen understanding into how local GSM accounts facilitate citizen engagement and co-production during public health crises, and how different it is from the central government's social media practices. Thirdly, according to the research by Ji et al. (2019), emotional strength, emotional presence, and emotional valence affect citizen engagement through social media differently. This study only focuses on the moderating role of emotional valence, and subsequent studies can further analyze the moderating role of emotional strength. Lastly, other influencing factors on CEGSM deserve further efforts, such as message strategies (Kim & Yang, 2017) and social presence (Yue et al., 2019).",
