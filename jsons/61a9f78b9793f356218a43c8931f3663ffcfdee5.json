            "text": "According to the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE), the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be easily spread during echocardiographic studies, with transesophageal echo (TEE) carrying a heightened risk since it can provoke aerosolization of the virus. Therefore, it is recommended that TEE be avoided in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients if an alternative imaging modality, such as transthoracic echo (TTE), can provide equivalent information. The ASE further recommends that such studies be as focused as possible while providing the appropriate information to guide clinical care 1 . The World Health Organization and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommend considering the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with refractory hypoxemia despite medical management 2,3 .",

            "text": "Our anesthesiology perioperative echocardiography service recently performed peri-procedural imaging during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (VV ECMO) placement in a patient with COVID-19 and severe ARDS. TTE, instead of TEE, was utilized in order to minimize contact with and aerosolization of infectious particles. Imaging these critically ill patients has unique considerations. Prone patients must be positioned supine for cannula placement, which may be detrimental to oxygenation and ventilation. High PEEP and respiratory rates may create challenges for transthoracic imaging, including limited windows and poor image quality. Imaging should be as efficient as possible in order to minimize procedural time and thus hypoxemia and exposure for the imager. VA ECMO may be necessary in some cases, since as many as 22% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 will have cardiac dysfunction 4 . Given these considerations, the goal should be to safely and expeditiously achieve images that are adequate to support the procedure, rather than images of the absolute highest quality.",

            "text": "To that end, our echocardiography team has decided to forgo our previously described approach to TEE imaging of VV ECMO in favor of a TTE approach in COVID-19 patients, as detailed in figure 1 . 5 Prior to prepping and draping the patient, the imager should assess gross cardiac function to inform the last-minute consideration of VA ECMO. Evaluation should include global biventricular systolic function, gross valvular abnormalities, extremes of volume status, and presence of pericardial effusion. During this initial survey, the determination of 4 whether parasternal, apical and/or subcostal views will provide adequate image quality to guide the procedure can be made. At this point it is reasonable to consider transitioning to TEE imaging if it is clear that surfaces images will not be adequate. In our experience with TTE-guided cannulation, the subcostal views provide the most relevant information for procedural guidance and can often be obtained in supine ventilated patients.",

While a TTE approach will certainly not always be feasible, it serves to provide adequate information while minimizing aerosolization, provider exposure, and procedure duration. A compact and portable ultrasound machine, such as the Philips CX-50, is easy to transport to the bedside, to cover with a plastic barrier, to fit within a limited space, and to clean (figure 2). Removal of EKG and other attachments minimizes equipment contamination and cleaning. The machine can be positioned so that the echocardiographer can manipulate the probe and knobs while the screen is also visible to the surgeon. It is helpful to also have a linear probe for the surgeon to use during internal jugular vein access, and to have probe covers for both probes. It would be reasonable to consider using a smaller-platform hand-carried ultrasound device for this approach, and it is likely that our team will attempt this in the future.",
