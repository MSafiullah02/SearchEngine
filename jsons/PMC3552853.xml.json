            "text": "The existence of commensal microbes that colonize organs within the human body has long been recognized and termed the microbiome [1], [2]. Once thought of as harmless tenants, it has become increasingly obvious that the microbiome is not comprised of passive passengers but of specific infectious agents that participate in shaping the metabolic and immune status of the host [3], [4]. The composition of the human microbiome at several body sites including skin, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, nasopharyngeal passage and urogenital tract are subjects of intensive study [2], [5], [6], [7], revealing both local effects at these sites but also systemic effects, including influencing inflammatory or metabolic functions in privileged organs such as the brain [8], [9], [10]. These latter studies have reported complex bacterial populations with wide variations in individual bacterial constituents at the species level, both in serially sampled humans and across groups of humans. The composition of the microbiome at the phylum level is consistent throughout the body with the exception of the skin, where diverse population structures occur at different sites [11], [12]. In most body sites sampled to date, Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes represent the dominant phyla with substantial numbers of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria detected, while other phyla comprise a small proportion of the remaining species. Importantly, body sites previously presumed to be sterile in healthy humans, such as the vascular endothelium, have been shown to be colonized without apparent signs of disease. In contrast, diseases such as biliary cirrhosis [13], [14], atherosclerosis [15] and aortic aneurysms [16], previously considered attributable to autoimmunity or pathogenic metabolites, are now hypothesized to be induced or exacerbated by infectious agents, possibly as part of local microbiomes",

            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with the ensuing development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a recognized cause of perturbation within microbiomes within the gut and other organs [17]. The altered immune status of HIV/AIDS patients is associated with qualitative and quantitative shifts in microbiome diversity and quantity as well as increasing the likelihood of microbial translocation from the gut to other organs [18]. These events occur because of reduced immune surveillance and damaged barrier function at epithelial and endothelial sites, including damage to the blood-brain barrier [19]. Multiple studies have shown the blood-brain barrier to be more permeable in HIV/AIDS, implying this circumstance might contribute to HIV-associated neurological disease [20], [21]. Given the emerging appreciation of microbiome disruption together with the damage to the brain injury during HIV/AIDS, we hypothesized that brain tissue from patients with HIV/AIDS might contain greater microbial quantities and perhaps diversity, derived largely from other organs such as the gut, which has a well-established microbiome and altered function during HIV infection. In fact, the present studies showed that all examined human brains contained bacterially-expressed RNA and associated products together with a predominance of \u03b1-proteobacteria, regardless of the patients\u2019 immune status and concurrent diseases. Moreover, a similar bacterial population was observed in the brains of non-human primates. This microbial population found in the human brain could be transmitted into immunodeficient mice and subsequently recovered 7 weeks later suggesting the brain was tolerant to the presence of certain bacterial species",

The most abundantly detected phylum in all samples was Proteobacteria, based on a patient-by-patient analysis (Figure 1A). Moreover, one of the dominant phyla in other organs (Firmicutes) was undetectable in most brain-derived RNA samples by this approach. The next most abundant phylum in most samples was Actinobacteria. The identities of minor bacterial constituents showed variation between different patients. Surgically-derived cerebral samples (SURG-1 and SURG-2) showed a similar predominance of Proteobacteria, but in contrast to the autopsy-derived specimens, Actinobacteria were not among the principal constituents (Figure 1B). The sequences mapping to members of the Proteobacteria phylum were examined at the class level, revealing that \u03b1-proteobacteria was the most frequently detected class of Proteobacteria in all brain samples (Figure 1C). In agreement with the distribution of bacteria in the present samples, the majority of bacteriophage sequences detected in autopsy-derived cerebral white matter specimens corresponded to Proteobacteria-tropic phage RNA (Figure 1D). Tags mapping to bacteriophage sequences were not identified in the surgically-derived samples. HIV-1 sequence-specific tags were also detected in brain specimens from the HIV group but other viral RNA sequences were infrequently detected by deep sequencing in the present specimens with the exception of the specimen from the ODC patient (ODC4) diagnosed with rabies encephalitis, from which in excess of 20,000 rabies virus sequence tags, spanning the entire viral genome, were identified [23]. To explore abundance of viruses known to infect the brain in more detail, the presence of viral genomes was investigated in total RNA and genomic DNA from HIV and ODC white matter samples. Cytomegalovirus (HHV-5), HHV-6A/B and Epstein-Barr virus (HHV-4) sequences were variably present in specimens from both groups of autopsied samples but other DNA and RNA viruses were infrequently detected in HIV or ODC brain specimens (Table 3).",

Several genes exhibited variable expression in HIV relative to ODC brains based on tag counts from the whole transcriptome analysis with myd88 showing marked suppression (4-fold) in HIV-derived brain specimens compared to the ODC group; conversely, lysozyme was induced in the HIV group (Figure 2A). Analysis of host genes germane to viral infections disclosed that antiviral genes such as mx1 and oas1 were induced in the HIV brains while MHC Class I genes (hla-c, -b and -a) were relatively suppressed in the same group (Figure 2B). Further analysis by real time RT-PCR showed that transcripts encoded by multiple genes implicated in host responses to viral infections of the brain were increased in the HIV/AIDS brains (HIV4, 7\u201310, n = 5)) with cd3\u03b5, egf and il-23 showing significant increases compared to ODC brains (ODC6-10, n = 5)) (Figure 2C). Network analyses showed associations between bacterial sequence tag quantities and variable expression of host genes implicated in essential cellular structure and maintenance functions (Figure S1). From these studies, it was evident that there was a differential expression of host neuroimmune genes in the clinical groups, emphasizing the divergent biological environments in the HIV compared to the ODC brain specimens.",

PCR conditions using several primer pairs were optimized in advance by colony PCRs using E. coli DH5\u03b1 as a template. All PCR reagents were confirmed to be free of contaminants using ultrapure water as no-template controls for all primer pairs (Figure S3A). In all brain samples examined, bacterial 16 s rRNA encoding sequences were detected, although PCR products were not detected in reaction in which there was no template (Figure 4A). The mean level of 16 s rRNA-encoding amplicons was similar in the HIV and ODC autopsied brain samples (Figure 4B) but greater than in the SURG specimens; 16 s rRNA sequences were not detected in the brains of FIV-infected cats (n = 3) and RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice (n = 3) (Figure 4B). Of note, amplification of bacterially-encoded groEL transcripts generated amplicons that were consistently detected at high cycle thresholds of \u226534\u201335, suggesting that bacterial transcript levels were low in human brains. To control for contaminated reagents and equipment used throughout the tissue collection and RT-PCR process cDNA synthesis was performed using ultrapure water and ultrapure water used to rinse a surgical tool (hemostat) opened in the operating theatre during the collection of SURG6 as the substrate in parallel with a subset of brain-derived RNA using the same reagents and equipment. This control product, used as a PCR template, failed to amplify an amplicon corresponding to 16 s rRNA or any other amplicons (Figure S3B). These studies verified the presence of bacterial RNA in human brain samples but also validated the methodologies used herein by showing all of the negative controls did not yield PCR products.",

For comparison, the same analysis was conducted using cDNA derived from serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors (n = 2). 16 s rRNA V3\u2013V4 sequences from HIV and ODC patients overlapped phylogenetically and with the cloned sequences derived from SURG specimens. Most sequences derived from blood corresponded to the Bacilli class and diverged from brain-derived sequences (Figure 4C). Proteobacteria sequences predominated among the brain-derived clones. When interpreted at the class level, the predominant class was \u03b1-proteobacteria, with some \u03b3- and \u03b4-proteobacteria representation. Of note, the sequences amplified from ODC patient 1 (ODC1) were the only sequences belonging to the Bacteriodetes phylum. The patient\u2019s history of hemorrhagic cerebral infarction, together with the distinct profile of 16 s RNA sequences observed in this patient might represent disruption of the blood-brain barrier, resulting in infiltration of atypical organisms that differed from the other brain specimens. Amplification of the 16 s rRNA V8 sequences again showed similar amplicon levels among ODC and HIV brain specimens (Figure S4A). Amplified V8 sequences from brain were identified as belonging to different classes of bacteria belonging to \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-proteobacteria, and Bacilli although \u03b2-protobacteria was the predominant class (Figure S4B).

Homogenized human brain samples (ODC13 and 14) with and without prior heat treatment, respectively, of the homogenate were stereotactically implanted into the striatum of RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice. The implanted mice were maintained for seven weeks and then sacrificed and total RNA was extracted from the brains. In mice that received unheated (ODC14) brain homogenates, 16 s RNA V3\u2013V4 sequences were detected at levels that were at 40% abundance of the original implanted human brain homogenate (Figure 6A). Conversely, 2 of the three mice that received heat-treated brain homogenates (ODC13H.T.) did not contain detectable 16 s rRNA while the third animal contained 16 s rRNA at levels >1% of the original implanted human (ODC13) tissue. The expression of ifn-\u03b1, il-1\u03b2 and il-12 (mouse) transcripts was examined in the brains of the both groups of recipient mice; these analyses revealed implantation of untreated brain homogenates did not evoke increased or sustained neuroimmune responses compared to animals\u2019 brains that received the heat-treated brain homogenates (Figure 6B). Expression of essential host gene transcripts such as calreticulin was also similar in both groups and neurological deficits were not evident in either experimental group of mice. Sequencing of 16 s rRNA from the initial untreated human brain homogenate (ODC14) and the corresponding recipient mouse brains showed closely related sequences with phylogenic clustering, again pointing to a high proportion of Proteobacteria-derived sequences (Figure 6C). Taken together, these results indicated that human brain-associated bacteria could be transferred into and recovered from the brains of recipient mice at comparable bacterial RNA quantities and diversity to the original implanted human brain homogenate.",

The majority of the bacterial RNA sequences identified in all human and nonhuman primate brains were encoded by members of the \u03b1-proteobacteria class, regardless of the underlying disease process. This restricted bacterial diversity observed in normal brain tissues is in contrast to the findings of a wide variety of organisms from other groups studying brain abscesses [24], [25]; many of which display colonization by bacteria from other tissues. This dichotomy in findings suggests that the bacteria identified in normal appearing tissue in the present studies might be are outcompeted and/or supplanted by organisms from other body sites in the case of intracerebral abscesses. Peptidoglycan immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization detection of bacterial rRNA were apparent within glial cells and in the extracellular space. In vivo cerebral implantation of human brain homogenates into mice showed that the 16 s RNA sequences recovered from recipient animals\u2019 brains were conserved and expressed at levels similar to the initial human brain homogenate. Transmission was interrupted by heat treatment of the initial homogenate, implying that viable bacteria were required for transmission. These findings indicated that bacteria were present in the primate brain and do not appear to be derived from the predominant populations at other human body sites. Indeed, the predominance of \u03b1-proteobacteria in the brain is unparalleled in other body sites where the microbiomes are dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes and Actinobacteria.",

The relatively greater abundance of \u03b2-proteobacteria identified using the V8 region amplicon might reflect a bias because of the poor discriminating power of the smaller V8 amplicon or the restricted diversity within this region relative to the analyzed V3\u2013V4 region amplicon, leading to imprecise assignment of sequences to this closely related class. There might also be a bias introduced by the PCR conditions, despite the use of universal primers, resulting in an over-representation of \u03b2-proteobacteria sequences. This finding needs to be clarified through culturing of brain specimens as part of future analyses to identify definitively the components of the primate brain\u2019s microbiome at the species level. Of interest, \u03b1-proteobacteria comprise one of the most diverse bacterial classes with wide spread biological niches and actions including detoxifying effects in the environment [22], [26].

The current tissues varied in harvest times and sources; for example, autopsy times ranged from 12\u201324 hr, while surgical samples were collected under sterile conditions and immediately frozen on dry ice in the operating room. To confirm that 16 s rRNA amplicons identified were intrinsic to the tissue and not introduced during sample preparation RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and PCR, extensive reagent and equipment controls were used throughout these studies up to and including having the entire process repeated by different personnel in another facility using different lots of consumables and reagents (Figure S3B). White matter was intentionally selected to limit blood contamination of samples; additionally, bacterial genome and products were detected in brain parenchyma remote from blood vessels and within cells (glia) known to phagocytose foreign materials. Likewise, the current simian brain samples were harvested and processed by different investigators in a distant facility, yet the same phyla were predominant in the majority of macaque brains examined. Brain samples from experimental animals reared in SPF conditions with concurrent immunosuppression (RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice and FIV-infected cats) were included as controls within these studies but did not show bacterial 16 s rRNA sequences in brain despite being processed in an identical manner to the human and macaque brains, even with prior amplification steps and identical preparatory methods. Despite the diversity of techniques and sources of the present brain tissues, \u03b1-proteobacteria represented the most prevalent bacterial class discovered within the human brain, which was in contrast to blood samples.

For example, an organism similar to many of the 16 s V8 region sequences, Delftia acidovorans has been implicated in endocarditis [27], bacteremia [28], [29], corneal keratitis [30] and urinary tract infections [31]. In addition to causing infections in compromised patients, D. acidovorans and other members of the Comamonadaceae have been identified as part of the bacterial community in the arterial wall in patients who have had aortic aneurysms [16]. D.\nacidovorans has also been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, sputum, urine, pharynx and wounds without concurrent signs of disease [32]. Taken together, this ubiquitous environmental organism likely represents a commensal organism with wide tissue distribution that can act as an opportunistic pathogen in vulnerable patients. As such, the prevalence of sequences showing similarity to Delftia sp. in the majority of patients in all the present clinical groups bears close scrutiny as host specific factors might determine whether or not this organism contributes to brain disease. Two HIV/AIDS patients exhibited sequences similar to Alcaligenaceae; members of this family have been identified as components of the normal flora in Peyer\u2019s patches [33], but members have also been implicated in endocarditis [34], bacteremia [35], [36] and meningitis with or without ventriculitis in neonates [37], [38], HIV-infected persons [39], other immunocompromised adults [40] or following invasive surgery [41]. Thus, identifying members of this family may represent translocation of commensal gut organisms to the brain or a previously unidentified subclinical infection in these patients.",

The sources of these agents might include oral consumption or inhalation with eventual transport to the brain as intracellular agents in activated leukocytes trafficking into the brain. The brain is constantly surveyed by trafficking leukocytes (activated lymphocytes and macrophages), which provide a Trojan horse mechanism for microbial entry into the nervous system across the blood brain barrier. In fact, this mechanism is well recognized as a route by which viruses infect the brain and likely underlies the detection of herpes viruses in both the HIV and ODC brains. Corroborating this latter point is the report of peptidoglycan detection in brain lesions from multiple sclerosis patients, which are heavily infiltrated with blood-derived leukocytes [42]. Since bacteria express multiple molecules that activate immune signaling cascades by engaging Toll- or NOD-like receptors, etc., their capacity for influencing brain function [43] is immense. Hence, studies focused on delineating the brain\u2019s microbiome at the species level together with their individual effects on host cell physiology might lead to a greater understanding of human neurobiology including cognitive, motor, sensory and behavioral functions.",

Multiplexed reads were deconvoluted according to sequence tags. Reads were aligned sequentially to a human rRNA database, then to the human transcriptome and genome [52]. Matching reads were removed and the remaining reads were aligned to a database of viral and bacterial sequences obtained from Genbank and the Human Microbiome Project. Following this analysis, matching reads were retained if they were above threshold for sequence quality (Q20), did not contain homopolymers, satisfied read pairing logic, and mapped unambiguously (i.e., to only one accession). Finally, putative hits were then subjected to contaminant screening, and were removed if there were any matches to other unrelated RNA-seq libraries generated in house from species other than human. All data were normalized within each run by total tag count. To avoid bias due to inter-run variation, values were first normalized by read length and then a total intensity normalization approach was performed. This approach relied on the assumption that the gene expression profiles between individual samples are similar. The average number of tags for each gene within a sampling run was plotted against the average of the same gene in the sampling run being compared. Linear regression was performed and the slope of the resulting trend line was used to scale the values for comparison between runs. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID Bioinformatic resources 6.7 Functional Annotation tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). Gene network analysis was performed using Ingenuity pathway analysis (Ingenuity systems, www.ingenuity.com). As the mean bacterial sequence tag counts in brain did not differ between the HIV and ODC groups (and RT-PCR amplification of bacterial 16 s rRNA from brain did not show differences between HIV and ODC groups), gene network pathway analyses of host gene tags were performed using data from all deep-sequenced autopsied brain specimens (n = 8). These calculations showed that total bacterial tag counts per patient (Table 2) were negatively (r<\u22120.7) or positively (r>0.7) correlated [44] with host gene tag counts for a subset of host genes (n = 154) among the host genes consistently detected (n = 7038) for all brain specimens. This analysis was extended and verified by calculating the correlation between total bacterial tag counts per patient with those identified 154 host genes, yielding 75 host genes that were significantly correlated with bacterial quantity (Spearman, p<0.05) (Table S1).",

The resultant cDNA was diluted with 100 \u00b5L ultrapure H2O for use in subsequent RT-PCR experiments. Multiple host response transcripts were quantified and compared using published primers (Table S2) and cycle conditions [45], [53], relative fold change of each transcript was determined by the delta-delta CT method normalized to the ODC values. RT-PCR detection of bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was performed using nested PCR protocols to amplify two distinct regions of the 16 s gene. An amplicon from the V8 region of the 16 s gene was generated from brain-derived cDNA using the universal bacterial primers RW01 or RDR080 with DG74 [54]. An initial denaturation step of 3 minutes at 94\u00b0C was followed by 35 cycles of 30 seconds(s) at 94\u00b0C, 45 s at 59\u00b0C and 1 minute at 72\u00b0C, followed by a 3 minute final extension at 72\u00b0C. Nested PCR reactions were performed using 5 \u00b5L of first round amplicon as a template with the primers 16 s1300F and 16 s1450R (Table S3). These reactions were run with an initial denaturation step of 3 minutes at 94\u00b0C was followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, 45 s at 59\u00b0C and 1 minute at 72\u00b0C followed by a 3 minute final extension at 72\u00b0C. Additional PCR amplifications targeting the V3\u2013V4 region of the 16 s gene were performed. The initial PCR experiment used the primers 16s339F and 16s926R (Table S3). The cycling conditions used for this primer pair were an initial denaturation for 3 minutes at 94\u00b0C followed by 20 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 57.5\u00b0C for 45 s and 72\u00b0C for 45 s then a final extension step of 3 minutes at 72\u00b0C. This amplicon was then used as a template with the primers 16s514F and 16s806R (Table S3) under identical cycling conditions with the exception that an annealing temperature of 56.5\u00b0C was used in place of 59\u00b0C. All reactions were run alongside a negative control reaction with 5 \u00b5L ultrapure H2O (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) added in place of template cDNA. Ten \u00b5L of each reaction were run on a 1.5% agarose gel impregnated with 4 \u00b5g/ml ethidium bromide for approximately 1 hr at 100V in TBE and visualized using an image quant 300 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) gel dock. PCR products were excised and extracted using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). 16 s rRNA PCR products were subcloned into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and propagated as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions in Library efficiency DH5\u03b1 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells were then harvested and the plasmids were isolated using the GeneJET kit (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada). Purified plasmid was quantified by nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and sequenced in both directions using the T7 and M13R sequencing primers and the Big Dye Terminator 3.1 (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA) Cycle sequencing kit followed by analysis on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer. Sequences were assembled from bi-directional reads and identified using the BLAST algorithm against the NCBI nucleotide database, in parallel with the RDP (Ribosomal Database project) classifier tool (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). Nearest matches were then compared to the brain-derived sequences using the MCoffee alignment suite (http://tcoffee.crg.cat/) or the Clustal X algorithm alone. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor joining method with ten thousand bootstrap trials using alignments generated by both methods and including corresponding rRNA sequences from recognized species closely matching the amplified bacterial rRNA sequences. To investigate the presence of bacterially-encoded transcripts, primers targeting groEL\n[55] were used in a semi-quantitative RT-PCR using RT-PCR super mix (BioRAD, Hercules, CA, USA) with autopsy-derived white matter cDNA, surgically-derived white matter cDNA, PBMC-derived cDNA and serum-derived cDNA as templates using an annealing temperature of 56\u00b0C.
