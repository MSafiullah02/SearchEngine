This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France. Methods: The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France. Results : We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; 2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of \"COVID+ units\". These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical checkups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies;",

On the 6 th March, \"the Plan Blanc\" was activated for all general hospitals, a plan that was not suited to realities in psychiatric hospitals and that neglected mental health on a broader scale (2) . The experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War in France is an example of the heavy price paid by the most vulnerable in times of crisis (3, 4) . Between 1940 and 1945, 76 000 people died in psychiatric hospitals, among whom 45 000 because of hunger and its complications. After a historical investigation, the hypothesis of active extermination dominated over the abandonment of psychiatric populations by a society living under a rationing regime. The historical research also highlighted psychiatrists' determination in this context of general powerlessness to return to the idea of healing, and to remove the \"insane\", deprived of the most basic needs, from the asylum at all costs (4, 5) . Insulin and cardiazol shortages from 1940 promoted sismotherapy which is better tolerated than the two previous treatments. \"Test outings\" (called \"permissions\", or periods of leave, today) appeared in this context where food was much more likely to be found outside than inside the asylum. To briefly sum up, the founding elements of contemporary psychiatry were initiated in a context of war.",

To illustrate the unpreparedness of our medical care system to face an epidemic, and 4 particularly the psychiatric sector, it was not until very late, on 23 rd March 2020, that the ministry of health and solidarity published recommendations and a leaflet applicable to medical care organization in psychiatry departments and health facilities authorized in psychiatry. Furthermore, the Contr\u00f4leur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des lieux de Privation de Libert\u00e9s (CGLPL -in charge of prisons and compulsory hospitalisation facilities) demanded specific measures for psychiatry from the Minister of Health (6, 7) .

Outside the epidemic context, hospitalized patients in psychiatry with schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depression, anxiety disorders or autism are at increased risk for pneumococcal infection (10) . More broadly, because of immuno-genetic vulnerability, these patients often have a poorer ability to defend themselves against infections, as shown by the epidemiological associations between psychiatric disorders and a very large number of infections (toxoplasmosis, herpes, etc.) in the course of psychiatric pathologies (11) . In addition, they are much more often affected by comorbidities than the general population, which are severe risk factors of SARS-Cov-19 infections (Table 1) (12) . Indeed, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease ranges from 30 to 60%, with a prevalence 1.5 to 2 times higher for people suffering from psychiatric pathologies compared to the general population. The same rates are observed for obesity in these populations (13) . These comorbidities, often insufficiently screened and treated, are largely responsible for a decrease in life expectancy of 10 to 15 years for patients with chronic psychiatric disorders compared to the general population (14) .",

Therefore, as with any acute episode, the monitoring of blood levels of narrow-margin psychotropic drugs (clozapine, lithium) appears to be a prudent measure. In addition, intracellular germ cell lung disease is known to cause hyponatremia (SIADH) as can also be the case with serotonergic antidepressants. In addition, in case of fever, tolerance towards antipsychotic drugs may be impaired, especially clozapine (24) . Finally, COVID-19 causes a respiratory syndrome, which may be aggravated by psychotropic drugs that depress the respiratory system (benzodiazepine, carbamates, opioids). The onset of respiratory symptoms should lead to a reassessment of the risk-benefit balance of these treatments. Further to this, several publications report the in vitro efficacy of certain psychotropic drugs on viruses similar to coronaviruses: in particular lithium and chlorpromazine (with greater efficacy than chloroquine), but this exclusively preclinical data to date does not make it possible to validate the clinical use of these treatments (25, 26) .",

Hospitals had been mobilized upstream, on March 6th, with the launch of the \"White Plan\" by the Minister of Health, including in particular the mobilization of the health reserve. Non-urgent activities were cancelled and logistic and human resources were concentrated on the care of people with COVID-19. Thus, scheduled surgeries were suspended, making it possible to free respirators from the operating theatres to create new intensive care beds. In the EHPADs (homes for the elderly) and establishments for the disabled, the Blue Plan (created after the 2003 heat wave) was activated on the same day, enabling the reorganization of the establishments in a few days to deal with the virus.",

They are required to self-monitor for the appearance of symptoms on a daily basis. Staff are specifically trained for the care of COVID (droplet and contact isolation, specific care, monitoring). The criteria for hospitalization in these units are a formal diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR, a clinical profile suggestive of COVID-19 (because the test is not available everywhere and produces high rates of false negatives) without signs of somatic severity (Table 5) , and a need for inpatient psychiatric care. Patients are discharged after the 14 days required to reduce contagiousness, if the psychiatric condition is stabilized and the patient is assessed as able to comply with confinement measures. Within the unit, a patient circuit and a care circuit make it possible to limit the risk of transmission, with dressing lockers for the caregivers, disposable overalls, a surgical mask and regular disinfection of all equipment, including non-medical equipment (keys, telephone, etc.). Rooms are emptied of all unnecessary equipment and theoretically each patient has his or her own dedicated medical equipment. If this is not possible, the equipment is disinfected between patients. Serving plates are for single use only and the linen is treated via the infected linen line. Before each entry into the room, the caregiver dresses with a hat, a gown, protective goggles, over-shoes and gloves overlapping the gown. A clinical and paraclinical assessment and a specific surveillance sheet have been developed for this unit. The main difficulty currently is to ensure that patients comply with the measures of isolation in their rooms, with the need to resort to sedation, which can aggravate respiratory symptoms. A telephone is left with the patient, who can contact the nursing station directly, as for example in the psychiatric department of La Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re.",

In particular, the assessment of the suicide risk should be repeated during follow-up, as the isolation created by the confinement may initially reduce the suicide risk by reducing access to the means, but may increase it in case of prolonged confinement. In particular, the creation of telephone hotlines dedicated to the care of people in suicidal crises is recommended, based on existing systems (suicide prevention centres, \"VigilanS\" systems) or the creation of further dedicated systems. The Prevention Suicide Centre at Le Vinatier Hospital has thus reorganised itself into a telephone hotline that receives calls from people in a suicidal crisis, or from their personal or professional entourage, in order to assess the intensity of the suicide risk and offer appropriate remote monitoring, based on the model of the brief contact interventions (48) .

There is concern that these same mechanisms could worsen prognosis for AUD patients in the setting of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic. There is also a risk of diagnostic delay in case of atypical presentations of COVID-19, such as agitation, hallucinations and seizures, which can be mistakenly attributed to alcohol consumption or complex alcohol withdrawal.",

Indeed, mortality increases with age and reaches 14.8% for individuals above 80 years of age, in contrast with the observed mortality rates for people under 40, evaluated at 0,2% (19) . Psychiatric disorders are frequent in the elderly population. The rapid transmission of Covid-19, its association with high mortality rates, the consequences of caregiver reorganisation and the confinement measures are all reasons to fear an exacerbation of psychiatric disorders and the aggravation of existing psychiatric symptoms, cognitive disorders and a loss of autonomy. The reorganisation of hospital care requires a reinforcement of measures ensuring the protection of this population. They are vulnerable to the risk of nosocomial infection by Covid-19, which can be spread at their expense by caregivers and other patients, and the clinical expression could be partially different (confusion, falls, etc). The prevention measures include strict barriers, and also requiring caregivers to systematically wear masks and the creation of \"Covid free\" units. Certain Covid+ patients with severe neurocognitive impairment, sometimes incapable of respecting barrier and isolation measures, also raise ethical questions regarding their care conditions. The elderly suffer more frequently from loneliness, which can be exacerbated in this epidemic context. They also have limited access to the technology tools developed for younger patients with psychiatric disorders. In addition, clinically stable elderly patients with psychiatric disorders generally need to regularly visit psychiatric care centers. However, the current confinement measures and the restrictions on public transport have inevitably become major obstacles to care access for these patients. Finally, the restriction of mobile psychiatric team interventions in nursing homes also compromises many patients' follow up and psychiatric care. Within this crisis, the psychiatry of the elderly therefore has to face numerous medical and ethical issues, in a context of shortage of specialised staff, aggravated by the temporary exclusion of staff who have been infected. A rapid, well thought-out and coordinated reorganization is underway and needs to be completed as soon as possible in order to meet current needs and anticipate future needs, which will probably be even greater once the epidemic wave is over.

Vulnerable people and situations at risk include babies, children and adolescents in child psychiatric care, and their families. The concern particularly relates to children and adolescents with developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD and OCD, or children who exhibit oppositional behaviours for instance, and who must stay confined. For them, teleconsultations are not as efficient. In addition, confinement could further aggravate mental health disorders among adolescents with suicidal ideation or self-harming, and among young patients with schizophrenia who have difficulties accepting confinement measures, or even patients with severe eating disorders who are confronted with new relationships with food in times of epidemic. Lastly, there is also another category of vulnerable children, those coming under the French child welfare system (Aide Sociale \u00e0 l'Enfance) or unaccompanied minors. Indeed, the coronavirus has begun to affect children and adolescents, and there is a need to anticipate these populations' care needs in the child psychiatry services and the \"Covid-psy\" units. But concern arises as to the possible mismatch between available resources and the levels of need. Child psychiatry services have been adapting (or are in the process of doing so) to organize ambulatory care by telephone or videoconference, and hospitalizations have been refocused on emergencies. However, the evaluation of needs is often difficult to achieve in situations of confinement where inter-familial tensions are sometimes exacerbated and where the reality of disease and death reinforce behavioural vulnerabilities and manifestations. Several services already offer guides to help parents and all those close to them, and are available to all health professionals. This is a step forward for the aftermath, but much remains to be done to help them resist. This crisis also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of our health care system. Child psychiatry, is in a situation of tension, and this pandemic will not fail to underline it once again.",

On the one hand, this underlines the operational mobilization capacity of mental health professionals, and also highlights the role that we can and must play in periods of crisis in \"somatic\" care structures to support and protect professionals.Concerning electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) sessions, as long as anaesthetists are not called in as reinforcements in the intensive care units, it is advisable to maintain them, ensuring the disinfection of the equipment between each patient, and the protection of the nursing staff. In all cases, ECTs should be preserved in their urgent indications. If ECTs are unavailable, the adaptation of psychotropic treatments should be given priority. For severe depression, ketamine infusions or the administration of esketamine intra-nasally or rTMS can be offered. For catatonia, the use of benzodiazepines or derivatives (lorazepam, zolpidem) and the substitution of dopaminergic treatments by non-dopaminergic sedative molecules (promethazine type) can be considered.",

The telephone collection of requests makes it possible to distinguish between situations requiring telephone care and more severe situations requiring intervention in the home. In the case of interventions in the home, the recommendations on protective measures related to the risk of COVID-19 infection should be applied (wearing a mask and gown, compliance with barrier gestures, etc.), in addition to the usual safety measures for caregivers intervening in the home. Protective measures should also be applied to the persons receiving the interventions (prevention of self-and hetero-harm risks, prevention of the traumatic risk related to coercive interventions). The \"Psymobile\" unit, located within the Le Vinatier hospital in Lyon, has thus refocused its activity in the home towards identifying and intervening in cases of severe acute psychiatric decompensation requiring emergency hospitalisation. A medical and nursing team can thus travel to the homes of patients, known or unknown to psychiatry, presenting a state of acute psychiatric decompensation in order to assess and refer in an emergency. In the parisian region, adult patients with autism can receive home visits thanks to a partnership between the Parisian resource center for autism and the adult autism team at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital. The upstream preparation of interventions, combined with precise coordination of the care trajectory, is a central point in the system. Whenever possible, patients who are usually followed on an outpatient basis should receive continuing of care organized by their referral service. With the decree of March 15th, pharmacies are authorized to accept expired prescriptions in cases of chronic illness and treatment prescribed for at least 3 months, until May 31st to limit interruptions in treatment (46). This measure was completed on March 19 th to be applicable for Opioid Substitution Treatments, anxiolytics and hypnotics (47). The consultation centres and day care facilities that had to close to comply with health instructions are organizing nursing and medical remote consultations, while maintaining the possibility of face-to-face reception for the most risk-prone situations. The closure of these care facilities is particularly disruptive for patients with psychotic disorders, who require adapted and repeated explanations of the interest of the confinement measures for themselves and for others.

The need to reorganize in extreme emergency in a context of unpreparedness and insufficient means to combat the risk of infection exposes patients and caregivers to an increased risk of infection, and patients to a risk of disruption of psychiatric care. On 23 March 2020, the Ministry of Health and Solidarity issued instructions and recommendations for psychiatric establishments which, on the one hand often remain very general and, on the other are not accompanied by concrete means for their implementation (6). The Chinese experience makes it possible to provide guidelines, which need to be adapted to the French context. The care of people with mental disorders in a context where the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is making other demands on psychiatrists and mental health professionals is an important issue, as the Chinese experience has shown (41,54-57): \uf0b7 the health care personnel mobilized to fight the epidemic are at risk of infection, psychological trauma and psychiatric decompensation, \uf0b7 Patients and families of patients with Covid-19 who, because of the ban on hospital visits, are in distress, require the intervention of psychiatrists and psychologists, \uf0b7 At national level, confinement measures are likely to create a strong demand for immediate psychological or even psychiatric assistance during the crisis. In this unprecedented health situation, and in the absence of international data, it is crucial to rapidly accumulate scientific knowledge in order to 1) optimise clinical, therapeutic and organisational decision-making as this crisis unfolds, and 2) draw lessons for probable future epidemic waves. Thus, an epidemiological monitoring system is currently being set up concerning COVID units in psychiatry, with the support of the National Coordination of Regional Clinical Research Mechanisms in Psychiatry and Mental Health, in order to measure the effectiveness of the measures put in place, morbidity, mortality and access to resuscitation care. More broadly, it seems to be a priority to set up epidemiological monitoring dedicated to all psychiatric patients in order to identify potential clinical particularities of the infection, to map the evolution of infectious morbidity/mortality, to monitor psychotropic treatments, and the number of psychiatric decompensation episodes/complications. Concerning the mobilization of public authorities, there is an urgent need for awareness at the highest level of the very great vulnerability of these populations and of psychiatric institutions in limiting the morbidity and mortality directly related to the infection and indirectly to the adaptation of psychiatric care to the health constraints of confinement.",
