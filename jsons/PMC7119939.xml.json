The upper ureter and renal pelvices become dilated, resulting in a physiologic hydronephrosis of pregnancy. This is a result of effects of progesterone on muscle tone and peristalsis on the urinary collecting system, and the mechanical obstruction by the enlarged uterus. There is also decreased bladder tone, increased capacity, and incomplete emptying of the bladder, all factors that predispose to vesicoureteric reflux. The hypokinetic collecting system reduces urine flow and predispose to ascending infection from the bladder to the kidneys.5\n",

In another survey of 46,179 pregnancies, 3.5% required antepartum admission for acute pyelonephritis.14 Urosepsis also is the leading cause of septic shock in pregnancy, predominantly due to E. coli.\n15 Over a 2-year audit at the Parkland Hospital Obstetrics intensive care unit, 12% of the admissions were for sepsis syndrome caused by acute pyelonephritis.16 The overall incidence of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy is about 1\u20132.5%, with an estimated recurrence rate of 10\u201318% during the same gestation.5 Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the major predisposing factor and others include obstructive uropathy, neurologic disease, renal calculi, and the need for catheterization.

Gentamicin levels (pre-and post-therapy) used to be recommended to assess toxic concentrations when multiple daily doses were in vogue. In pregnancy, there was an increase in vascular volume and the volume of distribution with enhanced glomerular filtration rate, resulting in a high prevalence of sub-therapeutic levels. With the advent of single dose of aminoglycosides, sub-therapeutic levels are no longer a problem as 3\u20135 mg/kg is given once daily. In this instance, the trough level only is assessed, and should be 0 to <2 \u03bcg/mL. In animal models, single daily doses of aminoglycosides are associated with less toxicity and may be more effective, but clinical studies have been less convincing (probably from small sample sizes).19 Sub-therapeutic trough levels of aminoglycosides given for a few hours once a high peak level is achieved is probably not therapeutically important, as the aminoglycosides have a prolonged post-antibiotic effect on coliforms (inhibition of the bacteria even after the antibiotic is removed) and the rate of killing is concentration dependent. It should be noted that in patients with renal impairment, the initial dose would be same as for normal renal function, but the subsequent dose or dosing interval would be adjusted according to the trough level and estimated gentamicin clearance.",

As noted in this report and other series, necrotizing fasciitis, whether in the abdomen or vulvar area, are usually polymicrobial.24\u201327 Obesity was a major predisposition, occurring in 86.9% of the entire cohort of 23 women. Severe pain on presentation was a common manifestation in 83.3% of puerperal complications and 70.6% of the non-puerperal patients. Common findings on physical examination include marked degree of subcutaneous edema with varying degrees of skin discoloration, rare presence of overlying anesthesia (one patient), and presence of subcutaneous gas by radiography in eight (34.8%) patients.24 The recognition and early diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis post-C-section or delivery is critical because delay in a few hours in intervention can be fatal.23 A characteristic feature of most cases that leads to delay in diagnosis is the benign-appearing wound and skin, but patients were systemically toxic or ill looking, often with persistent fever, marked leucocytosis and spreading inflammation of the surrounding tissues. Although radiographic studies,28, 29 ultrasonography, CT scan,30 or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)31 have been used to assist in differentiating cellulitis or ordinary wound infection from necrotizing fasciitis, or bedside biopsy for frozen section,32 there has been no prospective evaluation to assess differential merits and effect on outcome. In a small case control study of 21 necrotizing fasciitis and paired match controls, multivariate analysis found that a white blood count >14 \u00d7 109/L, serum sodium <135 mmol/L, and blood uren nitrogen >15 mg/dL separated those with necrotizing fasciitis from those with non-necrotizing infection.28 This study needs to be repeated in prospective larger trials and include other investigations, such as creatine phosphokinase, venous lactate, and easily obtainable portable imaging (ultrasonography).",

The fundamental principles of therapy include prompt administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and early immediate surgery with radical debridement of necrotic and devitalized tissue, until normal bleeding tissue is visible.23 Nutritional support and correction of fluid and electrolyte balance, anemia, and renal impairment are of major importance. The need for immediate aggressive surgery for necrotizing fasciitis has been recognized since the 1950s33 and reinforced by more recent guidelines.34 Initial observation showed that the average time from onset of disease to diagnosis and treatment was 4 days for those who lived, and 7 days for those who died.35 Other subsequent studies found 48 h duration was a more significant time frame, after which the mortality rate was 75%.27 The critical time for radical surgery after admission to hospital for manifestations of necrotizing fasciitis appears to less than 12 h, as significant morbidity exists if surgery is delayed for >12 h.36\n",

Although the evidence was inconclusive for low-risk patients undergoing C-section, use of antibiotic prophylaxis was also recommended (level C evidence). In a Cochrane review of the topic,39 81 studies were analyzed for elective C-section (N = 2,037) and non-elective C-section (N = 2,132). There was a finding of reduction of endometritis by two-thirds to three quarters, and a significant reduction of wound infections (36% for non-elective and 73% for elective C-section).39 The policy of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for all C-section was also supported by other reviews.40, 41 Thus, a single dose of safe, inexpensive antibiotic is very affective in preventing endometritis and surgical wound infection after C-section. It is most likely that in case 2, the infection ascended from the vagina to the uterine cavity (with endometritis), then spreading to the wound and surrounding tissue causing necrotizing fasciitis. Thus, if prophylactic antibiotics were given, it is more likely than not that the serious puerperal infection would have been prevented. It should be noted that the patient under discussion fulfilled the criteria for high-risk C-section, which is associated with post-operative infectious complications of 70\u201390% without antibiotic prophylaxis.",

An editorial comment in 1991 stated that the current evidence supported the clinical impression of higher risk for pulmonary complications during anesthesia in subjects with respiratory tract infections.58 The issue was again raised in 2001 after a study in children concluded that recent and active URTI (within 4 weeks) were at increased risk for adverse respiratory events, but most of the children underwent elective procedures safely without increased morbidity.59 A later study by the same group of investigators in 713 children undergoing cardiac surgery, found the presence of URTI was predictive of postoperative infection and multiple complications.60 However, there is no similar data in adults and specifically no recent data of the risk of GAS pharyngitis peri-operatively. Guidelines for prevention of surgical site infection noted increased risk of wound infection with any coexistent infections at a remote site,61 but did not specifically address the issue of pharyngitis. In a previous study of 2,349 patients with clean surgical wounds, wound infection rate in 208 patients with documented remote infections was 14.8% compared with 6.9% in the 2,141 patients without remote infections (p > 0.001).62 However, in this study pharyngitis was not listed as one of the remote infections.",

Moreover, the effects of these adverse outcomes may affect not only the mother but also the offspring. The way to limit being sued for medical malpractice when managing or attending pregnant women involves the same principles of good medical practice that should always be followed. Pay attention to detail, (history, examination, and test results), keep an open mind, always look for the worst complication, but do not overlook simple \u201cminor issues\u201d which may become major issues, and always attend and treat promptly. Whenever there is a potential for a catastrophic outcome, (despite the rarity of that event) have a high index of suspicion and do not hesitate to refer or transfer patients quickly to an acute care hospital or tertiary care center, or request a consultation with a specialist. Too often however, basic principles of treatment are neglected until it is too late -- such as not opening and exploring a local infected wound. To a certain extent, we as physicians are too over dependent on modern technology (CT, MRI) and specialist opinion before implementing the basic tenets of proven therapy, which have been established for more than a century.",
