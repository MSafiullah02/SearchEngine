In this review, we argue that mammalogists are uniquely placed to contribute to addressing these challenges because in-depth knowledge of mammal species is fundamental to the development of wild model systems that could accelerate discovery in disease ecology. The use of animal models-species for which a broad range of diagnostic, molecular, and genetic tools have been developed-in tightly controlled laboratory environments has been instrumental in driving progress in the biomedical sciences. However, in natural populations, disease processes operate in the context of enormous genetic, phenotypic, and environmental variability. Understanding diseases in animal populations (including humans) thus requires investment in \"wild animal models\" that explicitly include individual variation and relevant environmental gradients. Wild mammal groups such as primates and rodents have already been identified as potentially useful models of infectious diseases in the wild. Here, we discuss the enormous potential that ungulates hold as candidates for wild model systems. The diversity, broad geographic distribution, and often high abundance of species in this group make them a highly accessible target for disease research. Moreover, a depth of background knowledge, close relationships to domesticated animals, and ongoing management of many wild ungulate species provide context, tools, and opportunity for cutting-edge research at the interface of ecological and biomedical sciences. Studies of wild ungulates are already helping to unravel some key challenges in infectious disease research, including the role of parasites in trophic cascades, the consequences of climate change for disease dynamics, and the systems biology of host-parasite interactions. Other areas where ungulate studies may provide new insight include research on the sources and drivers of emerging infectious diseases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Parasites are the most abundant and diverse trophic group on the planet. They are ubiquitous in all natural populations and act as a fundamental driving force in mammalian ecology and evolution (Barber and Dingemanse 2010; Tompkins et al. 2011; Dunn et al. 2012) . Human activities are drastically altering biotic communities via biodiversity loss and species invasions, including pathogens. Anticipating and managing the resulting changes in disease dynamics is one of the most daunting challenges of our time. Meeting this challenge will require continued progress in understanding disease processes in complex ecological communities. Motivated by these urgent basic and applied questions, infectious disease ecology and evolution are experiencing rapid growth as areas of scientific enquiry. The biomedical sciences investigate host-pathogen interactions at suborganismal (cellular and molecular) scales with the aim of discovering targets for intervention that can modify these interactions to prevent pathogen invasion (e.g., vaccines) or promote their expulsion (e.g., antimicrobial drugs). Ultimately, the goal is to help individual patients prevent or manage disease. By contrast, the role of disease ecological and evolutionary studies is to increase our understanding of the role that host-parasite interactions play in driving population and evolutionary dynamics and to apply these insights to disease management at the population scale, for biological conservation, veterinary health, and public health.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 222, "text": "(Barber and Dingemanse 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 223, "end": 244, "text": "Tompkins et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 245, "end": 262, "text": "Dunn et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Disease ecologists ask fundamental questions about disease processes in host individuals, populations, and communities such as under what conditions can a given parasite invade a host population and how fast will it spread?

What roles do different host species play in spreading or attenuating infection? And how do host-parasite and parasite-parasite interactions at the molecular level scale up to affect population-level disease dynamics? Consequently, variation among individuals and environments is of fundamental interest in disease ecology, whereas experimental approaches in biomedicine typically go to great lengths to limit such variability, in an effort to discern molecularlevel interactions more clearly. Biomedicine has established a number of successful laboratory model systems, developing a sophisticated array of molecular and genetic tools that have transformed the study of disease processes at suborganismal scales. In this review, we argue that disease ecology, too, can benefit greatly from model study systems.

Common models in disease research include small laboratory animals such as mice (Mus musculus) and rats (Rattus rattus- Niewiesk and Prince 2002; Buer and Balling 2003) , nonhuman primates such as macaques (Macaca) and marmosets (Callithrix-Nath et al. 2000) , and other vertebrates such as pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and zebra fish (Danio rerio- Lieschke and Currie 2007; Meurens et al. 2012) . These organisms all possess traits that make them well suited to studying host-pathogen interactions in captive settings. For example, small laboratory animals are often readily accessible, easily manipulated, and relatively simple and inexpensive to maintain under laboratory conditions. Larger organisms such as macaques are more expensive to maintain in captivity, but share a high degree of genetic and physiological similarity to humans, making them an invaluable model for a number of human diseases (Gardner and Luciw 2008) . Importantly, almost all of the common animal models are associated with a large repository of resources and tools that facilitate studies of infection and immunity at the molecular, genetic, and cellular levels. In the laboratory mouse for instance, decades of basic research on all aspects of biology, a sequenced genome, and an abundance of mutant strains form the backdrop of ever-expanding research into links between genes and disease (Chinwalla et al. 2002; White et al. 2013b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 236, "text": "Niewiesk and Prince 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 237, "end": 259, "text": "Buer and Balling 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 320, "end": 349, "text": "(Callithrix-Nath et al. 2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 440, "end": 465, "text": "Lieschke and Currie 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 466, "end": 486, "text": "Meurens et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 995, "end": 1019, "text": "(Gardner and Luciw 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1462, "end": 1485, "text": "(Chinwalla et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1505, "text": "White et al. 2013b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "What makes a good model system?"}, {"text": "Despite extensive insights derived from the use of animal models in biomedicine, the applicability of these models, particularly mouse models, to complex conditions in humans has come under recent scrutiny (Coers et al. 2009; Seok et al. 2013) . From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, this ongoing debate prompts even broader reflection about how studies of infectious diseases in laboratory and captive settings apply to natural populations in the real world. Unlike the laboratory, the real world is complex and most animals, including humans, interact with parasites and pathogens in this highly variable context. This reality has fueled ideas that \"wild\" animal models may be as important as laboratory models in the study of infectious disease processes (Wolfe et al. 1998; Pedersen and Babayan 2011) . Whereas laboratory animal models have paved the way toward advancing our understanding of disease processes occurring at the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels, the promise of wild models lies in their potential to help define how mechanisms revealed in the laboratory operate within the genetic, phenotypic, and environmental contexts that characterize natural populations. The use of wild models may also facilitate the inclusion of a more diverse set of organisms in infectious disease research, allowing for increasingly powerful comparative studies. However, the challenge is to find wild study systems that will balance realistic complexity with tractability and can thus serve as effective models for discovering how infectious disease processes function in nature.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 206, "end": 225, "text": "(Coers et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 226, "end": 243, "text": "Seok et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 769, "end": 788, "text": "(Wolfe et al. 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 789, "end": 815, "text": "Pedersen and Babayan 2011)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "What makes a good model system?"}, {"text": "If wild models can contribute to innovation in infectious disease research, a question that arises is, what types of organisms would make good wild animal models? If by definition model species in the laboratory setting are organisms that are simple, readily accessible, and easily manipulated, by extension, good wild models might be highly abundant, easy to find, and amenable to observational, experimental, or longitudinal studies. In addition, good wild models might be characterized by close genetic, physiological, or other similarity to humans or their domestic animals. Moreover, if wild models are to act as bridges between the laboratory and the real world, the ideal wild models should be associated with resources and tools that allow for molecular-level approaches to be applied in the field. Several groups of mammals squarely fit these criteria (e.g., wild rodents, wild primates). Mammalogists are thus uniquely positioned to spearhead efforts to develop new wild models for disease ecological research. Here, we focus on the ungulates as a mammalian group that has much to contribute to our understanding of infectious disease processes in the wild.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "What makes a good model system?"}, {"text": "Terrestrial hoofed mammals (ungulates) from the orders Cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) and Perissodactyla (oddtoed ungulates) are a diverse and widely distributed group.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "How do ungulates measure up as wild models?"}, {"text": "With between 250 and 450 species recognized (Groves and Grubb 2011) , ungulates occur in almost every terrestrial ecoregion, ranging from tropical forest to tundra. The wide distribution and abundance of many ungulates make them highly accessible for disease ecological research. The fact that rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are widely distributed across Asia contributes to their use as the major nonhuman primate model of infectious disease (Mitruka et al. 1976; e.g Chenine et al. 2008; Semenya et al. 2012) . Likewise, the widespread occurrence of baboons (Papio) in Africa and the Middle East, coupled with typically large population sizes, may explain the increasing number of field-based infectious disease studies focusing on this group (Weyher et al. 2006; Tung et al. 2009; Drewe et al. 2012; Akinyi et al. 2013) . Importantly, numerous ungulate species share these characteristics-broad geographic range and large population sizes-making them easy to locate and observe. Moreover, for some ungulate species like whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and wild boar (S. scrofa), a high level of accessibility coupled with an extensive knowledge base on basic behavior, ecology, life history, physiology, population dynamics, and evolution provide an attractive menu of candidate wild model systems that can be used to investigate questions about infectious diseases processes in a range of environments. Another important criterion for a good animal model is tractability. In the context of a wild model, the organism must be amenable to studies that include repeated observation, direct manipulation, or both. The power of laboratory models has always been that they allow for direct manipulation and experimentation in controlled settings. Given the inherent variability of natural environments, achieving fundamental insights from wild \"model\" organisms requires the ability to experimentally manipulate individuals in the field or to track individuals through time, both of which are techniques that maximize power for drawing inferences about disease processes in the wild. Both approaches are challenging in natural populations, but recent studies of wild rodent systems in Europe illustrate that key insights can be gained from applying these study designs in natural populations. For instance, Telfer et al. (2010) used longitudinal studies of wild voles (Microtus agrestis) to demonstrate that interactions among parasites occurring within hosts are as important as, if not more than, host and environmental factors in determining infection risk.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 44, "end": 67, "text": "(Groves and Grubb 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 445, "end": 466, "text": "(Mitruka et al. 1976;", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 467, "end": 470, "text": "e.g", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 471, "end": 491, "text": "Chenine et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 492, "end": 512, "text": "Semenya et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 747, "end": 767, "text": "(Weyher et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 768, "end": 785, "text": "Tung et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 786, "end": 804, "text": "Drewe et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 805, "end": 824, "text": "Akinyi et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2365, "text": "Telfer et al.

This makes studying fitness consequences of infectious diseases a more substantial time commitment and attaining significant sample sizes more challenging. Heritability and genetic selection pressure of pathogens are likewise more difficult to study in species with a long generation time, and capturing large animals can be difficult and time consuming, making longitudinal studies more costly. Nonetheless, important insights into infectious disease processes have emerged from experimental and longitudinal studies of a growing number of free-ranging ungulates (Table 1) . These case studies show that wild ungulate populations can be used to address topics ranging from the fitness consequence of infection in wild populations to the drivers of immunological variability in nature (Table 1) . However, this type of work could expand to many more species. Even though ungulates are much larger in size than rodents and longer lived, traits that make field studies more logistically challenging and expensive, these perceived disadvantages offer some important benefits. For instance, in studies where multiple physiological, immunological, and other variables Among adult females, previous exposure to pneumonia was associated with a decrease in the risk of future disease-related mortality; however, a lamb's risk of dying was positively associated with its mother's previous exposures", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 647, "end": 656, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 868, "end": 877, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "How do ungulates measure up as wild models?"}, {"text": "Uses individual-based data to reconstruct how hosts respond immunologically to an unknown causative agent Plowright et al. (2013) must be tracked through time, the large body size of ungulates allows for the collection of sufficient sample volumes (e.g., blood, feces) from live animals, an objective that can be difficult to achieve using smaller study organisms. Also, studying long-lived model species like ungulates makes it possible to examine links between life span and infectious disease processes, questions that are particularly relevant for understanding chronic diseases including many observed in human populations. Finally, from a practical standpoint, the logistical difficulties of working with ungulates are tempered by the fact that this is the only mammalian group for which management of wild species is a worldwide phenomenon (Apollonio et al. 2010) . Ungulate management varies by species and geographic region but is typically managed by governmental wildlife organizations and may include controlled hunting, disease management, radiotracking, population censuses, and animal translocations. Often, these management activities can go hand in hand with disease research, reducing the cost of accessing wild ungulates and enhancing study feasibility. Indeed, collaboration between researchers and managers is routine in studies of ungulate ecology. Recently, such collaborations have given rise to a number of important insights into the ecology and evolution of infectious disease in wild populations (Jolles et al. 2005; Robinson et al. 2012; Schaschl et al. 2012) .

These resources include, but are not limited to, diagnostic assays for identifying pathogen exposure and infection, molecular and immunological reagents for quantifying physiological, immunological, and biochemical responses of the host to infection, and drugs and vaccines that can be used for manipulating host susceptibility or infection status. Many livestock species, including cattle (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis aries), goats (Capra hircus), pig (S. scrofa domesticus), and horses (Equus caballus), serve as models of both human and animal diseases, and a plethora of resources have been developed for use in these species. For example, the genomes of the cow, sheep, pig, and horse have all been fully or partially sequenced (National Animal Genome Research Program 1998 -2014 , and the development of immunological reagents for veterinary species is a major focus of many biotechnology companies. Importantly, the close phylogenetic relationships between wild and domesticated ungulates mean that many of the resources developed for livestock can be applied to studies of their free-ranging relatives with modest additional investment. Indeed, there are an increasing number of examples where molecular, genetic, and immunological tools from livestock have been successfully adopted for use in their wild relatives (Grobler et al. 2002; Poissant et al. 2009; Olsen and Johnson 2012) . Transferring molecular tools from livestock to related wild species does involve optimizing protocols to take account of species-specific concentrations of target substrates (e.g., Beechler et al. 2012) or differences in reagent affinity for species-specific proteins (e.g., antibody affinity in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays). The validity of diagnostic tests must be demonstrated in wildlife species (e.g., Michel et al. 2011; Gorsich et al. 2014) , and vaccine and drug efficacy carefully evaluated. While genetic resources from related domestic species are potentially valuable in analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data from wild ungulates, interspecific variation at genetic loci of interest can thwart attempts to identify target genes for important traits-such as disease resistance-in wildlife (Brown et al. 2013 ). These caveats notwithstanding, modifying existing assays is typically a lesser hurdle than designing them from scratch: the transferability of molecular and genetic tools from domestic species makes wild ungulates one of only a few mammalian groups where cuttingedge research at the interface of ecological and biomedical sciences can take place.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 923, "end": 968, "text": "(National Animal Genome Research Program 1998", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 969, "end": 974, "text": "-2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1535, "text": "(Grobler et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1557, "text": "Poissant et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1581, "text": "Olsen and Johnson 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1786, "text": "Beechler et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1998, "end": 2017, "text": "Michel et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2038, "text": "Gorsich et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2394, "end": 2412, "text": "(Brown et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "How do ungulates measure up as wild models?"}, {"text": "Studies conducted on wild ungulates are addressing some of the major current challenges in infectious disease ecology and evolution (Table 1 ).

The approach has been applied primarily to suborganismal biological systems, such as cells or tissues (e.g., cancer biology- Wang et al. 2013 ; cancer and personalized medicine-Benes 2013; viral pathogenesis- Law et al. 2013 ; human microbiome-Weinstock 2012), but it is just as relevant in disease ecology (Fig. 1) . In the face of rapid environmental change, a mechanistic understanding of disease dynamics as emerging from the interplay of genetic, environmental, immunologic, and behavioral factors that define host-parasite interactions is urgently needed to improve our ability to anticipate and manage shifts in infectious diseases. This is a formidable challenge that cannot be addressed adequately in laboratory-based systems because host genetics and environmental variation are likely to interact in shaping immunity and host behavior (Fig. 1, arrows 1-4) . Host behavior defines the opportunities for parasite transmission through contacts among hosts, with vectors, or with environmental reservoirs of infectious material. Immunity then determines which contacts between hosts and parasites actually lead to infection and how infections progress within the host. Ultimately, the host-parasite interaction results in fitness effects on hosts and parasites, which scale up to shape population dynamics for both (Fig. 1 , arrows 5-8). When these interaction mechanisms are poorly understood, our predictions of disease dynamics under changing biotic and abiotic environmental conditions rely on statistical extrapolation from current and past conditions. However, given potentially new parameter combinations and nonlinear functional relationships between environmental drivers and host immunologic or behavioral responses, such predictions must be viewed with caution. A mechanistic framework linking host genetics and environmental variation with immunologic and behavioral responses that determine disease dynamics could complement statistical approaches, improving our ability to predict how infectious disease patterns are likely to change when host population or environmental parameters are pushed outside previously observed conditions by anthropogenic forcing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 324, "text": "(Ideker et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 325, "end": 337, "text": "Kitano 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 465, "end": 481, "text": "Wang et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 549, "end": 564, "text": "Law et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 647, "end": 655, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1206, "text": "(Fig. 1, arrows 1-4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1669, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "How are wild ungulates already contributing to infectious disease research?"}, {"text": "Disease studies in feral Soay sheep have been at the forefront of progress toward addressing this formidable challenge (Fig. 2) .

Mortality risk during these events varies with parasite burdens, which depend on genetic background (Paterson et al. 1998; Coltman et al. 1999; Coltman et al. 2001a ). Variation in parasite resistance in Soay lambs is moderately heritable. However, in adult sheep, the evidence for heritable variation in parasite burdens is weak (Beraldi et al. 2007) , suggesting that environmental factors and infection history may outweigh host genetic background in determining parasite burdens throughout the lifetime of the sheep. Consistent with this, cumulative environmental stress (Hayward et al. 2009 ) and season (Hazlerigg et al. 2013 ) have both been shown to affect parasite resistance in Soays. A recent study (Brown et al. 2013) attempted to identify genes associated with variation in parasite burdens and immune traits in Soay sheep, using a candidate gene approach. Genes known to be involved in parasite resistance in domestic sheep and cattle were evaluated. While several genes did show significant associations with parasite burden, these associations were no more common in candidate genes than in randomly selected \"control\" genes.

Population-level variation in genes associated with parasite resistance may be maintained by tradeoffs, if parasite immunity is costly to the animal and if environmental variation or animal characteristics such as age and sex modify the fitness effects of different alleles. Investigations into the genetic basis for parasite resistance in Soay sheep have demonstrated such context-dependent trade-offs between parasite resistance and fitness: high antibody responsiveness was shown to be heritable in Soays and associated with improved survival of female sheep during harsh winters (Graham et al. 2010) . However, balancing this apparent benefit, heritable high antibody responsiveness also correlated with reduced reproduction.

The suitability of Soay sheep as a wild model for research on the systems biology of infectious disease is due to several population traits: The sheep are highly observable because they habituate readily and their environment is sparsely vegetated. Population size is relatively easy to assess, because the sheep occur on an island, which limits population size and prevents migration. The biotic context for disease studies is comparatively simple, with no other ungulate species, no predators, and a limited number of parasite species in the community.

Brucellosis (pathogen: Brucella abortus) is a bacterial infection that causes morbidity and abortions in a broad range of host species including cervid and bovid ungulates as well as humans. Preventing spillover of the infection from elk to cattle is likely to prove even more challenging than limiting disease spread from bison because elk are far more abundant than bison and range freely over large swathes of the landscape. The observed increase in brucellosis has been linked to increases in elk population density over the past 20 years and massive expansion of elk winter aggregations coinciding with the seasonal transmission peak for B. abortus (Cross et al. 2010a (Cross et al. , 2010b . These increases in elk density and B. abortus seroprevalence have occurred in elk populations outside Yellowstone National Park. At the same time, elk populations inside the park (White et al. 2012 ) and migratory elk that spend part of the year in the park (Middleton et al. 2013a ) have experienced low recruitment and declines in numbers and group size. Direct and indirect effects of predation by wolves and grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park, climate-driven changes in plant phenology, and competition with elk feeding on irrigated pasture on private land have been implicated as mechanisms driving poor performance of elk in the park (Creel et al. 2011; Griffin et al. 2011; Middleton et al. 2013a Middleton et al. , 2013b Wilmers and Levi 2013) . Brucellosis in elk in the park remained stable at low prevalence (Barber-Meyer et al. 2007) , and elk declines in the park have been accompanied by increased recruitment of woody vegetation (Ripple and Beschta 2012) . While more work is needed to understand the causes underlying elk population dynamics in Yellowstone National Park (Massey et al. 2013) , these correlations suggest that predator protection may be effective as part of a strategy both for limiting the spread of brucellosis in elk and for restoring western deciduous woodlands in the United States.

In the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, it is indirect effects of rinderpest, an infectious disease of artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates), that act as a dominant driver of woody plant dynamics (Holdo et al. 2009 ). Rinderpest is caused by a Morbillivirus that was introduced into the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem with European cattle in the late 19th century. The disease decimated wild bovid populations until the early 1960s, when it disappeared from wildlife, following vaccination of cattle in surrounding areas (McNaughton 1992) . The irruption of wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) in this ecosystem following rinderpest eradication caused a sharp reduction in fuel load due to increased grazing, which in turn reduced fire frequency and intensity. This promoted woody plant recruitment, shifting more area from grassland to woodland and altering ecosystemwide nutrient dynamics (Holdo et al. 2009 ). Infectious diseases can thus play contrasting roles as causes or consequences of trophic cascades in different ecosystems, depending on the interplay between disease and predation, the trophic niche of the host (grazer or browser), and the abiotic context that underlies ecosystem dynamics.

Future studies investigating the diversity of infectious agents in wild ungulate populations may shed light on likely taxonomic and geographic sources of new pathogens.

Host genetics and the environment affect immunity and host behavior (1-4)-which determine susceptibility and transmission opportunities for parasites(6, 8). Parasites cause heterogeneities in host fitness (A), driving population genetic structure (B). Immunity and behavior may affect fitness directly (5, 7), e.g., through allocation trade-offs against other fitness components such as growth or reproduction. In combination, variation in host traits and the environment thus drive host population and disease dynamics. (Our focus is on host and environmental traits as drivers of disease dynamics. For simplicity, direct effects of genes on fitness and of environment on fitness and parasites are not depicted as arrows.)Fig. 2.-Soay sheep (Ovis aries) and their parasites-a model system in disease ecology. Many of the mechanistic links illustrated in this schematic have been explored in Soay sheep. Gaps remain, shown as dotted arrows, in linking host genetics with behaviors relevant to parasite transmission and host fitness. References (by arrow number): 1)Coltman et al. (1999Coltman et al.
