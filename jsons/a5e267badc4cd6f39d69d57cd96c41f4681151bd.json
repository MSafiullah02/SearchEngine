Aggressively serving stallions often present a problem during semen collection by artificial vagina. The collector usually stabilises the artificial vagina either against the hindquarters of the mare or against the side of the posterior end of the phantom. With vigorous thrusting of the stallion the artificial vagina may move forward along the side of the mare or phantom. Eventually it may slip so far forward that the stallion's hindlegs move around the posterior end of the mare or phantom to be positioned alongside the mount. Many mares become restless in this position and try to move away or kick. Where the stallion adopts this position on a phantom it may lift the front leg on the collector's side over across to the other side to straddle the phantom. This situation is not only dangerous for the collector, but often upsets the stallion which may develop an intense disliking for the procedure and refuse to cooperate during subsequent attempts at semen collection.",

A long dorsal slit was made in the mounting to a accommodate the artificial vagina's valve when the former is inserted into position (Fig la) . The mounting slopes cranioventrally at an angle of 15\". This ensures that semen does not pool inside the vagina but drains off into the collection beaker. A steeper slope upset the stallions too much and often prevented them from ejaculating.",

A 1 cm thick metal ring is welded into the inner circumference of the artificial vagina mounting, about 25 cm from the caudal opening.

The other three stallions were teased by positioning an oestrous mare alongside the phantom and removing it as soon as the stallion attempted to mount.

Further assistance was not required and the stallions served independently (Fig Id) . Sometimes a stallion would stop thrusting momentarily. A few firm squeezes of the collector's hand on the base of the penis would usually restore thrusting (Fig le) . Upon ejaculation most stallions remained on the phantom until the penis was withdrawn into the prepuce, and then they dismounted at their own leisure (Fig If) . This contributed largely to a favourable attitude of the stallion to this form of semen collection. The dummy's stability has proved most useful in preventing injuries to personnel, stallions and the artificial vagina.
