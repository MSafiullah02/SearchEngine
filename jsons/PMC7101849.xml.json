Studies have shown that, in patients with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, circulating oxidative products are increased and that circulating antioxidants are decreased [1, 2]. This led to the assumption that the administration of antioxidants such as selenium might prevent organ dysfunction and lead to survival benefit. Three randomized clinical trials have been conducted where the efficacy of selenium supplementation was compared to placebo treatment. These trials provided conflicting results [3\u20135]. A hypothesis that may explain these conflicting results is that the activation of lipid peroxidation varies among patient populations. Support for this hypothesis comes from a study of 50 patients; oxidative products were increased only in the event of hepatic dysfunction and coagulopathy, but not in the event of respiratory and circulatory failure [6]. The need for study of circulating products of lipid peroxidation in homogeneous cohorts becomes obvious.",

We selected a homogeneous patient population with bacteremia by Gram-negative pathogens. All these patients also had infection-associated organ dysfunction according to the new Sepsis-3 definition [7, 8]. We explored the relationship between lipid peroxidation and organ dysfunction using measurements of malondialdehyde (MDA), which is an indirect expression of the generation of free radicals synthesized by neutrophils. Free radicals attack polyunsaturated fatty acids embedded into cell membranes and lead to the formation of MDA [9]. As a consequence, circulating MDA is an indirect expression of the capacity of neutrophils for the generation of free radicals and for their involvement in sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Secondarily, we studied the risk for infections by carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, since patients with impaired neutrophil function may be susceptible to infections by these hospital pathogens.",

Patients were then divided into two groups; patients with MDA above the cut-off or high level and patients with MDA below the cut-off or low level. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for septic shock at that cut-off were calculated according to Mantel and Haenszel. Comparisons of quantitative baseline characteristics between the two groups were done by Student\u2019s t-test and of qualitative baseline characteristics by Fisher\u2019s exact test.

This index is decreased in septic shock and it is compatible with the exhaustion of the innate immune defense that takes place when septic shock develops [15]. The functional significance of the index is fully demonstrated among the non-shocked population. In that population, where shock does not exist as a driver for mortality, circulating MDA lower than 2.70 mM indicates the presence of neutrophil exhaustion and this can independently predispose to death.",

First of all, these patients have a low MDA, which implies an exhaustion of neutrophil function. This may lead to more acquisition of prevalent hospital pathogens. A more attractive explanation comes from the recent findings of our group. We have recently shown that isolates of K. pneumoniae which produce carbapenemase suppress T17 cells and subsequent production of interleukin (IL)-17 [16]. IL-17 is a major chemoattractant for neutrophils at the infection site. Low MDA could come from suppressed production of IL-17.",
