Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most prevalent virus found in these children, accounting for 60-80 % of cases. The rate of hospitalization is less than 2 %. Up to 8 % of those hospitalized require ventilatory support [ 1 , 2 ]. Three clinical presentations of severe bronchiolitis have been described. Acute hypercapnic respiratory distress is the most frequent form, resulting from respiratory muscle fatigue associated with alveolar hypoventilation. Recurrent severe apnea occurs in 1.2-23.8 % of cases [ 3 , 4 ]. The latest clinical presentation is predominantly alveolar and can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [ 5 ] . Obstruction of the bronchioles increases the work of breathing (WOB), which represents the energy required to overcome the increased airway resistance. Infants, especially those born prematurely, are more prone to respiratory muscle fatigue.",

High-fl ow cannulas (HFCs) deliver positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) that can attain 3 or 5 cmH 2 O, and some studies suggested that it could obviate the need for endotracheal intubation [ 7 , 8 , 13 -15 ]. There is no strong level of evidence that NIV avoids intubation and is benefi cial for patients compared to intubation. During the last decade, however, increasing numbers of clinical and physiological studies have reported a good experience of NIV as the primary ventilatory support mode. Currently, CPAP is widely used as the fi rst ventilatory support in many centers, with a decreasing rate of intubation.",

            "text": "In a physiological study of 37 infants, Hammer and colleagues showed that RSV infection could lead to two pulmonary function abnormalities [ 5 ] . The most common is bronchiolitis, an obstructive airway disease characterized by increased airway resistance (respiratory system resistance, R rs ), air trapping [high functional residual capacity/total lung capacity (FRC/TLC)], reduced TLC, and low respiratory system compliance ( C rs ) compared with normal values. Typically, chest radiography of these children shows bilateral perihilar infi ltrates and hyperinfl ation. Of the 37 infants, 10 had a resistive profi le, corresponding to the criteria of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with very low C rs and R rs . Radiography revealed bilateral alveolar consolidations. This form corresponded to RSV pneumonia. The mechanism of apnea associated with RSV infection is not completely understood. Immaturity of central ventilatory centers is likely to be one of the explanations, which can explain the high prevalence of apnea in infants born prematurely and infants <2 months of age. The real incidence of apnea varies among studies, from 2.5 to 28.0 %, depending on the case mix. Among children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) the incidence is much higher [ 3 ] . It is probably important to distinguish primary apnea from apnea occurring after several hours of respiratory distress and a high level of WOB. The latter is likely to be due to muscle fatigue, which occurs more rapidly in young infants and those born prematurely.",

            "text": "Obstruction of small airways is the main physiological phenomena of RSV infection in infants. It is the consequence of bronchial and peribronchial infl ammation, plugging of airways by mucus and cellular debris, and bronchial smooth muscle constriction ( Fig. 27.1 ) . Consequently, the airway resistance and respiratory load increase. To preserve their pulmonary function, infants use their accessory respiratory muscles, increasing their WOB. They also increase their respiratory rate, but because of airway obstruction the duration of the expiratory period is too short to expire completely. Air is then trapped in the alveoli, generating dynamic hyperinfl ation and auto-PEEP. The inspiratory time/total respiratory time ( T i / T tot ) ratio increased as T i decrease ( Fig. 27.1 [ 7 , 16 , 17 ] . These measures were obtained using an esophageal and gastric probe with balloons. The PTP es per breath was obtained by measuring the area under the diaphragmatic pressure ( P di ) and the esophageal pressure ( P es ) signal between the onset of inspiration and the end of inspiration. Essouri et al. showed in ten infants with severe bronchiolitis that the median level of auto-PEEP generated was 6.05 cmH 2 O (range 3.9-9.2 cmH 2 O) [ 16 ] . They showed that the decrease in WOB was greater with a CPAP level of 7 cmH 2 O compared to 4 or 10 cmH 2 O. This suggested that application of extrinsic PEEP decreased the pressure gradient between the mouth and alveoli at end-expiration. It allowed air to pass through the airways, reducing the work required for the next inspiration. The Montpellier team in France confi rmed these results and the role of CPAP in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). They compared ten children treated with nasal CPAP at 6 cmH 2 O to nine children managed with oxygen alone [ 17 ] . The T i / T tot and transcutaneous carbon dioxid partial pressure (TcPCO 2 ) were decreased in the CPAP group and the WOB was signifi cantly reduced compared to that in control patients. This improvement of the WOB was correlated with the clinical improvement assessed by the modifi ed Wilson Clinical Asthma Score (mWCAS).",

In infants, endotracheal intubation can be complicated by subglottic edema with a risk of evolution to tracheal stenosis. Mechanical ventilation of children with severe airway obstruction is challenging and may expose the airways and the lungs to high pressures or high volumes, causing lung injury. Most of infants who are mechanically ventilated require sedative drugs and sometimes muscle paralysis. The need for central venous access is common. These invasive procedures are associated with blood loss and expose children to nosocomial infection (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection, bacteremia). The safety of sedative drugs in immature brains is not completely established. Hence, NIV represents a good alternative because its use rarely requires sedative drugs. On the other hand, the main risks of NIV are pneumonia aspiration in a child with an altered level of consciousness and potentially delayed intubation.",

The stability of PEEP is not guaranteed and the level of PEEP reached can be insuffi cient to counterbalance the WOB. An in vitro study from Sivieri et al. showed that the airway pressure varied widely with the degree of nares occlusion by the prongs and by the amount of mouth leakage [ 25 ] . At 6 L/min HFC with the mouth open the airway pressure was <1.7 cmH 2 O. It was <10.0 cmH 2 O when the mouth was closed. Complete nares occlusion can generate high airway pressure (up to 20 cmH 2 O) when the mouth is closed. Further studies comparing CPAP and HFCs would be useful to understand which children should benefi t from CPAP rather than HFC. The latter system has the advantage of being simple to apply, usable in emergency units, and minimally expensive. Criteria used to initiate HFC or CPAP should be better defi ned and validated. A selection bias cannot completely be excluded because the level of severity of the infants treated is diffi cult to compare among studies. Moreover, as criteria to initiate ventilatory support are not well defi ned, those used in the various studies are likely to be different. Some authors have included children with severe respiratory distress and severe hypercapnic acidosis, whereas others have put children on ventilatory support considering only the signs of retraction or the level of tachypnea.",

In infants with bronchiolitis, the tolerance is reportedly good, although no study has specifi cally addressed skin or mucosal injuries in the context of bronchiolitis. As nasal breathing has to be preserved, nasal obstruction, which frequently occurs during RSV infection, should be systematically treated and monitored. Nasal obstruction is a source of discomfort and agitation for children treated by nasal CPAP. Consequently, nasal lavage with NaCl 0.9 % every 3 or 4 h is recommended. The choice of the cannula's size is important to limit leaks and avoid nose injuries. It is recommended that nasal prongs of different sizes with different inter-nostril distances be readily available. To limit mouth leaks, a dummy is frequently used and sometimes a chinstrap is required. To avoid skin irritation or ulceration and to improve the patient's comfort, colloid ulcer dressings (e.g., Comfeel, Coloplast) are applied to protect the nasal bridge as well as the nostrils.

The studies that have reported the use of BiPAP or ASB in patients with bronchiolitis used a level of PEEP varying from 4 to 8 cmH 2 O and inspiratory pressures between 10 and 20 cmH 2 O. The level of pressure support varied from 4 to 12 cmH 2 O. NIV pressures >20 cmH 2 O are associated with a high risk of gastric dilatation by gas. To minimize this phenomenon, a nasogastric tube is routinely inserted to defl ate the stomach when necessary. In our clinical practice, when an infant is switched from CPAP to NIV on pressure support, we start with a level of PEEP equal to the level of CPAP used and then add pressure support of 6 cmH 2 O above PEEP or an inspiratory pressure of 6 plus PEEP. Then, after assessing the effi cacy and tolerance, we adapt the ventilator setting or the interface, avoiding exceeding 20 cmH 2 O. The inspiratory pressure is titrated by 2 cmH 2 O increments to a level where the RR, signs of WOB, and blood gases are improved.",

The sensitivity of ventilatory triggers is sometimes insuffi cient for young infants, who are unable to trigger a ventilatory cycle. On the contrary, when the sensitivity of the trigger is too high, and when the leaks are important, autotriggering may appear, generating discomfort and asynchrony. Control of leakage is another factor contributing to synchrony: If the ventilator is unable to compensate for the leaks, the inspiratory time can be prolonged into the period when the child wants to expire. These causes of asynchrony are a source of discomfort and poor tolerance of NIV in infants.",

Nasal CPAP is become the fi rst mode of NIV for children who meet the criteria for ventilatory support. Numerous studies have suggested that this strategy is associated with a decreased need for intubation and invasive ventilation. Although the level of evidence of improved outcomes related to this strategy is low, in the absence of prospective controlled studies the data published have shown that children can be safely managed less invasively without prolonging the PICU stay. Some studies suggested that responders to nasal CPAP had a lower length of PICU stay than those who were intubated. Physiological studies have provided some evidence that a CPAP level of 6-7 cmH 2 O is able to decrease the WOB and improve alveolar ventilation in children with obstructive bronchiolitis [ 7 , 16 , 17 ] . The application of extrinsic PEEP to the airways at a level greater than the level of auto-PEEP generated by dynamic obstruction of small airways allowed reduction of efforts made by the child to initiate the next inspiratory cycle. This mechanism is responsible for the clinical improvement observed in the children after initiation of nasal CPAP. The responders are those whose RRs are reduced and CO 2 levels and heart rates are decreased within 2-4 h of starting NIV with CPAP. Early identifi cation of those who will respond is crucial so as not to delay applying NIV with two levels of pressure or intubation with invasive ventilation.",

This system has been shown to generate a low level of PEEP, induce washout of nasopharyngeal dead space, match inspiratory fl ow rates in infants, and improve mucociliary clearance [ 24 ] . Children with apnea and those with severe hypercapnic acidosis are more likely to fail HFC and can be treated by nasal CPAP. As no study has been conducted comparing HFC to nasal CPAP, no recommendation can be drawn. There is a crucial need of studies to better distinguish groups of children who will respond to HFC, to CPAP, or to NIV because the level of expertise and equipment differ significantly between these modes. HFC can be initiated in the emergency or intermediate care units, whereas CPAP and NIV should be reserved for use in an intermediate care unit or an ICU according the level of the teams' experience. Stratifi cation of respiratory distress severity is required for better patient selection at admission. We know that patients with a medical history of chronic lung, heart, or neuromuscular diseases are at higher risk of complications and failure of HFC or CPAP. Young infants, particularly those born prematurely and those with low weight, are more likely to require ventilatory support [ 1 , 6 ] . However, the clinical score, biological markers, and blood gas criteria associated with ventilatory support and with CPAP failure, are not well defi ned and require further study. Moreover, as no study has been performed on NIV at two pressure levels in bronchiolitis, there is no evidence that NIV after CPAP or HFC failure can obviate the need for intubation and invasive ventilation. Only a multicenter prospective study comparing different ventilatory strategies would be able to determine the best ventilatory support treatment.",
