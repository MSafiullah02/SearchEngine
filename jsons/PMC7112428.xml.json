The S1 subunit recognizes and binds to the corresponding host receptor, whereas the S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion between the virus and host cells [[13], [14], [15]]. Since intervention of S1 subunit binding to host receptor shows a great antiviral potential, there are increasing studies to elucidate their interaction mechanisms. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [16,17] and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [[18], [19], [20]] have been identified as the receptor for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. The viral receptor-binding domains (RBD) are located in the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of the S1 subunits (S1-CTDs) [17,19,20]. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) [21,22] and TGEV [23,24] utilize aminopeptidase N (APN) as the host receptor and their RBDs are also located in the S1-CTDs [22,24].",

Its causative agent, PED virus (PEDV), was an Alpha-coronavirus. Previous studies showed that a porcine receptor APN (pAPN) mediated PEDV infection [[31], [32], [33], [34]] and its density appeared to be an important factor in contributing to the virus efficient infection [35]. PEDV S1-CTD (residues 505\u2013629) was further demonstrated to interact with pAPN ectodomain (residues 63\u2013963) [36]. Interestingly, a few recent studies show that pAPN is not the functional receptor for PEDV infection [37,38]. However, there is a lack of direct demonstration of the interaction between pAPN and PEDV S protein to clarify this discrepancy.",

As shown in Fig. 2, there were differences between the bands of each target protein under reducing (Lane 2) and non-reducing (Lane 1) conditions, which implied that they contained disulfide bonds. In addition, the bands showed a significant change after de-glycosylation using PNGase F (Lane 2 and Lane 3). Therefore, the recombinant proteins were heavily glycosylated compared to their calculated molecular masses (pAPN ectodomain: 104 kDa, PEDV S1 protein: 85.5 kDa, PEDV S1t protein: 15.1 kDa). Based on the results above, recombinant pAPN ectodomain was obtained as dimers, and PEDV S1 or S1t protein existed as monomers, which showed similar natures of mammalian APN [43] and other coronavirus S proteins [[48], [49], [50]] as previously reported.",

As described previously [22,24,43,63,64], pAPN ectodomain adopts a hook-like conformation or so-called seahorse shape (Fig. 5B and C). It is consisted of four domains (I-IV) and a zinc ion in Domain II, characteristics of M1 metallopeptidases (Fig. 5A and B). In addition, it is heavily glycosylated, and Cys758 and Cys765 in association with Cys795 and Cys831 bridge into two disulfide linkages in Domain IV (Fig. 5B), which are consistent with our results stated above (Fig. 2). A close structural comparison of our current pAPN ectodomain and that determined by others (PDB code: 4HOM) reveals that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) differences are slight (0.361 \u00c5 for 853 matching C\u03b1 atoms), demonstrating that they share almost identical structural fold (Fig. 5C).",

However, the Vero cell lines, possessing no APN [32,41], are efficiently infected by PEDV, and widely utilized for isolation and series propagation of the virus [41,[65], [66], [67], [68]]. Recently, no effects were reported on the susceptibility to PEDV after knocking out APN in porcine swine testis cells and human cell lines (human hepatoma cells, Huh7 cells and human cervical cancer cells, HeLa cells) by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing [38]. Moreover, soluble pAPN ectodomain neither interacted with PEDV nor inhibited its infection [37]. All these studies infer that pAPN may be not the receptor for PEDV. To date, there are few direct evidences to clarify this discrepancy by characterization of the interaction between pAPN ectodomain and PEDV S protein in vitro.",

            "text": "We speculate that the lack of related studies is probably due to the difficulty in preparing the large PEDV S protein, which contains many disulfide bonds and glycosylation sites as other coronaviruses [48,49]. In the current study, three canonical assays were carried out to characterize the interaction between pAPN ectodomain and PEDV S1 or S1t protein since these functional target proteins were successfully prepared. According to previous reports, coronavirus S-RBDs and their host receptors have high affinities and yield stable complexes in vitro, which can be obtained by gel filtration chromatography [17,20,22,24,69,70]. Therefore, we firstly characterized the interaction between pAPN ectodomain and PEDV S1 or S1t protein by gel filtration chromatography. The results showed that there were no complexes formed in these protein mixtures as no complex peaks appeared (Fig. 6\n). Additionally, we performed native-PAGE to detect whether they formed complexes. As shown in Fig. 7A, there were no bands of the protein complexes compared to single proteins. Interestingly, PEDV S1t protein showed other forms in addition to monomers (Figs. 6B and 7A). In order to further corroborate the interaction between the proteins, the kinetics of pAPN ectodomain binding to PEDV S1 or S1t protein were measured by SPR using Biacore S200. The profiles showed that there were no signal responses during their association and dissociation phases, which demonstrated that pAPN ectodomain neither interacted with PEDV S1 nor S1t protein under physiological condition (Fig. 7B). In contrast, HCoV-229E [22] and TGEV [24] RBDs had high affinities to their receptor APN. These results were similar to SARS-CoV RBD not binding to DPP4 or MERS-CoV RBD not binding to ACE2, while the K\nD of DPP4 binding to MERS-CoV RBD was about 16.7 nM (K\non: 1.79 \u00d7 105 M\u22121 s\u22121, K\noff: 2.99 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u22121 s\u22121) [20].",

As S protein recognizing and interacting with the host receptor are crucial for PEDV infection, further research needs to be carried out to identify the genuine receptor of PEDV and elucidate the specific interaction between them.",

The pAPN ectodomain in the current study is colored in green and the pAPN ectodomain previously determined is in cyan. Their N and C termini are labeled.",
