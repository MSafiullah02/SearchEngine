            "text": "Sialic acids (Sia), a large family of neuraminic acid derivatives, are acidic monosaccharides common in higher animals and some microorganisms. They are found in cellular secretions and on the outer surface of cells, mostly as terminal components of glycoproteins and glycolipids (gangliosides) [1\u2022]. Sia are exposed to the cellular environment functioning in intrinsic and extrinsic communication and in defense. The same holds for mucin secretions, in which Sia not only increase viscosity but also help to protect epithelia from harmful substances and pathogens [2, 3]. It is not easy to describe a general role of Sia because these monosaccharides participate directly or indirectly in multiple and diverse cellular events. However, in addition to their negative charge, it is useful to divide their functions into two groups that explain many phenomena. Firstly, Sia act as a biological mask, that is an antirecognition agent by shielding recognition sites such as penultimate monosaccharides of glycan chains or (antigenic) proteins and other macromolecules of cell membranes including receptor molecules. In this way Sia contribute to cells being \u2018self\u2019. This may be possible by their electronegative nature together with their bulky, hydrophilic chemical structure (Figure 1\n). Secondly, Sia operate in the opposite way by being biological recognition sites, that is ligands for a great variety of molecules such as hormones, lectins, antibodies, and inorganic cations. Especially the latter two protein classes have been recognized recently as being involved in most important phenomena of cellular and molecular interactions in both physiological and pathological processes. In this respect, polysialic acids (PSA) are presently drawing much attention [4]. Furthermore, many microorganisms infect cells by binding to Sia and thus exploit the host organism. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms will enable the development of therapeutic or prophylactic strategies [5].",

About 50 Sia types are known, with N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), followed by N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and O-acetylated derivatives, mostly N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) as most frequent forms [6] (Figure 1). This Sia variability can be increased by metabolic incorporation of non-natural substituents into cell membrane Sia, which also modulate their functions [7].",

            "text": "In contrast to masking, Sia participate in many recognition processes by interacting as ligands with specific proteins (lectins or other receptors) of vertebrate cells, protozoa, bacteria, mycoplasma, viruses and with hormones, toxins, lectins, and antibodies [1\u2022, 12, 26]. This versatility renders them important regulators of physiological events, although pathogens may exploit them for their own purposes. Among the numerous virus species recognizing Sia the oldest and most prominent example are influenza viruses where the role of Sia in their binding and spreading has been well investigated and led to the development of antivirals, based on the inhibition of the sialidase or \u2018receptor-destroying enzyme\u2019 involved in the infection mechanism [5]. At present attention is given to the study of the binding specificity of influenza and other viruses. A most prominent result is the difference between the human viruses (e.g. H3N2, recognizing N-acetylneuraminyl galactose that is \u03b12,6-linked) and avian viruses (e.g. H5N1, showing \u03b12,3-linkage preference). However, the efficiency of a virus to infect also depends on the distribution of such Sia glycosides on cells and on additional properties of cell membranes [27, 28]. Reconstitution of the 1918 influenza virus which had caused a fatal pandemic showed that this strain, in contrast to contemporary human strains, can overactivate the innate immune system of the host and thus lead to a deadly \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 [29].",

Fifteen siglecs were identified in mammals [36, 37, 38]. These membrane-bound I-type lectins belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and occur in various cell types of the immune and hematopoietic systems of primates and rodents or in the central nervous system as is the case of the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG; Siglec-4). Each Siglec has a distinct preference for the Sia and linkage type. O-Acetylation can mask the ligand function of Sia in the case of sialoadhesin (Siglec-1), CD22 (Siglec-2), and MAG [17, 36]. Furthermore, the degree of O-acetylation of the capsular polysaccharide of Group B Streptococcus affects the interaction between the bacteria and CD33-related siglecs of leukocytes [37]. While mouse and ape CD22 preferentially bind to Neu5Gc, the human one prefers Neu5Ac, which parallels the loss of Neu5Ac hydroxylation in man.

For example, CD22 is an inhibitory receptor of B-cells that regulates multiple B-cell functions and lymphocyte survival. A future aim for the modulation of B-cell function and reduction of inflammation is to design CD22-specific inhibitors by synthesis of novel sialosides with hydrophobic substituents at C-9 of Sia [40]. Most human siglecs are related to CD33. They undergo rapid evolution and regulate leukocyte functions during inflammatory and immune responses [41]. Many questions are open regarding the function of MAG localized in periaxonal Schwann cells and oligodendroglial membranes, which binds to \u03b12,3-linked Sia of gangliosides and is involved in glia\u2013axon interactions [42]. This selectin is a target antigen in autoimmune peripheral neuropathy including multiple sclerosis.",

They bind to the tetrasaccharides sialyl-Lewisx and sialyl-Lewisa. Crystallographic studies revealed the formation of \u2018catch bonds\u2019 for selectins during the interaction with immobilized ligands, whereby large regions of the lectin domain switch between two distinct states [44]. A bond is called a catch bond if its lifetime increases with force up to a critical level. Such mechanosensitive bonds formed under nonequilibrium conditions can explain the threshold observed for leukocyte rolling. Lymphocyte L-selectin specifically recognizes also the sulphated version of sialyl-Lewisx found on the high-endothelial venules of peripheral lymph nodes. The selectins are involved in rolling and migration through the endothelium of lymphocytes and thus in immunological and inflammatory events. Tumor cells often bearing sialyl-Lewisx residues can also bind to selectins, which provide a route for tumor cell migration and metastasis formation [3]. Sia O-acetylation may impair this interaction [17]. Normal cellular human prion protein (PrPc) contains both sialyl-Lewisx and Lewisx glycans. It was found to bind to selectins, but surprisingly only by the Lewisx moiety [45\u2022]. In that case sialylation prevents selectin interaction, which can be reversed by sialidase treatment.",

In particular, intensive research on PSA and siglecs has shed light on cell and neuronal tissue differentiation and immune regulation. Knowledge how tumor cells and microorganisms, especially viruses, can exploit the properties of Sia also increased appreciably. Still, more work is necessary to fully understand these phenomena, and it is necessary to obtain more information about the regulation of Sia biosynthesis, degradation, and modification on the gene and protein levels, how, for example hormones influence these events, as well as on structural aspects of Sia\u2013receptor interactions and supramolecular arrangement of sialylated glycans in cell membranes. This will increase the sialo-pharmaceutical possibilities to fight against the many infectious, immunological, malignant, psychiatric, and degenerative diseases in which Sia are involved.",

Sia are biosynthesized in many steps from glucose leading to both N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate (ManNAc-6P) and phosphoenol pyruvate, which are condensed to Neu5Ac-9-phosphate followed by dephosphorylation [6, 7]. The formation of ManNAc-6P from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme, the UDP-GlcNAc epimerase/ManNAc kinase (encoded by GNE), which is the key enzyme in Sia biosynthesis and can be feedback-inhibited by CMP-Neu5Ac. After the activation of Neu5Ac with CTP the resulting CMP-Neu5Ac is transported into the Golgi compartment and transferred to nascent glycoconjugates by a large family of monosialyltransferases and polysialyltransferases with varying specificities for glycoproteins and glycolipids [47]. Neu5Ac can be converted to Neu5Gc on the CMP-Neu5Ac level in the cytosol by the action of CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH) [6]. The activity of this enzyme was lost during human evolution [38]. Enzymes O-acetylating Sia at C-4 of the pyranose ring or at C-7 to C-9 of the side-chain also seem to be frequent, studied best in animals in bovine submandibular gland [6, 17, 48]. Only prokaryotic sialate-O-acetyltransferase genes could be identified so far and some insight into the catalytic mechanism of OatC from Neisseria meningitidis was obtained [49\u2022]. Hydroxylation and O-acetylation as well as other natural or artificial Sia modifications strongly influence the physiological properties of Sia.",

Only after the unmasking of a sufficient number of galactose residues (a \u2018cluster\u2019), attachment to another cell, for example a macrophage, via galactose-recognizing receptors is possible. O-Acetyl (black dot) or N-glycolyl (black triangle) groups may inhibit the enzymatic release of Sia and the interaction of these monosaccharides with Sia-recognizing receptors, for example, siglecs, or with viruses and bacteria. These Sia modifications are involved in fine-tuning of recognition events or can even be considered as molecular switches. O-Acetylation may fortify masking of immunogenic epitopes on microorganisms and enable escape from immune defense [49\u2022]. In this model symbols for Sia-recognizing receptors have not been drawn, and the symbol used for the Sia molecule could also represent oligosialic acids or polysialic acids, which may carry non-natural N-acyl or O-acyl modifications. The degradation of Sia is initiated by sialidases [6, 50, 51], which strongly influence the behavior of normal and malignant cells. Polysialic acids can be split into Sia oligosaccharides by endosialidases from phages [52]. For de-O-acetylation of Sia a variety of esterases from animals and microorganisms are known [6, 53].",

The terminal Sia carries an O-acetyl (red) at C-9, which renders this frequent ganglioside an important regulator and biomarker of growth, differentiation, and malignancy of neuro-ectodermal tissues, as well as of lymphocyte function and apoptosis [17]. GD3 can directly be O-acetylated at C-7 by mammalian sialate-O-acetyltransferases, followed by migration of the O-acetyl to C-9.
