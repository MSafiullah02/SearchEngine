Recent structural studies predict that 155 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly interact with CD26 on the host cells 22 . CD26 is a cell surface 156 glycoprotein involved in T-cell receptor-mediated T-cell activation and proliferation. It is highly 157 expressed in CD4 and CD8 T cells, and in lower quantities also in NK cells and DCs. As an additional 158 function, it acts as a serine exopeptidase, cleaving peptides of various chemokines, growth factors 159 and peptide hormones. Interestingly, it is also involved in extracellular matrix cleavage. It has been 160 shown in human cells that several polymorphisms in CD26 gene reduce entry of MERS into the host 161 cells 46 .

ACE2 was more abundant in the lung, when compared with the skin barrier sides. In bronchial 227 biopsies ACE2 was co-expressed with TMPRSS2 ( Figure S2 ). Also, in the skin TMPRSS2 was very 228 prominent, while we did not find SLC6A19 in any of the analyzed cells and tissues ( Figure 1B and S1). including SARS-CoV, HIV-1, measles and others 11-13 .

In China, less than 1% of the SARS-CoV-2 positive 270 cases were in children younger than 10 years of age 50,51 . Therefore, we analyzed expression patterns 271 of ACE2-, CD147-, and CD26-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( Next, we compared ACE2-, CD147-and CD26-related gene expression profile in the purified 283 na\u00efve CD4 + T cells between young children and adults ( Figure 2B ). Low expression of ACE2-related 284 genes was observed in both children and adults. Several CD147-related genes showed higher 285 expression in adults, including CD44, certain MCTs, SLC3A2 (CD98), SLC2A1 (GLUT1), NFATC1 and 286 NFATC3. Also, CD26 (DPP4) was expressed at a higher level in adults.

Upper and lower airways are the 295 initial entry of SARS-CoV-2, thus we first analyzed gene expression in the HBECs and the bronchial 296 biopsies from patients with asthma or COPD as compared to the non-diseased controls. In our 297 cohorts, we did not see any significant difference in ACE2 expression in HBECs or bronchial biopsy 298 between control, asthma and COPD patients ( Figure 3A and B). However, in bronchial biopsies ACE2 299 expression was higher in smokers ( Figure 3B ). In HBECs, we observed higher expression of TMPRSS2 300 in asthma ( Figure 3A ), raising the possibility that in asthmatic airways the cleavage of spike protein 301 of SARS-CoV-2 might be more efficient. We also observed a trend of increased expression of CD147 302 (BSG) in HBECs ( Figure 3A ) and in bronchial biopsies ( Figure 3B ) from COPD patients. Additionally, 303 glucose transporter GLUT1 (SLC2A1), integrin a-3 (ITGA3) and galectin-3 (LGALS3) were higher 304 expressed in HBECs, whereas SLC7A5 (CD98), integrins a-3 (ITGA3) and a-6 (ITGA6) were higher 305 expressed in the bronchial biopsies of COPD patients. CD44 and APOD were higher expressed in 306 asthma ( Figure 3A , B and Figures S4, S5) . In bronchial biopsies, ACE2-, CD147-and CD26-related genes 307 showed similar cluster of co-expression in control and asthma ( Figure S2 and S6). Interestingly, ACE2 308 co-expressed with PPIB and NME1 in asthma, which was not found in controls ( Figure S6 ).

We did not find any significant 340 correlations between BMI and age and the receptor-related gene expression in the bronchial 341 biopsies. However, we noted that the expression of SLC16A3 (MCT4), ITGA3, LGALS3 in BAL positively 342 correlated with BMI ( Figure 4A -C) and the expression of CD44 positively correlated with the age of 343 the subjects ( Figure 4D ). Interestingly, whole blood expression of CD147 (BSG), PPIA, S100A9, CD44 344 and LGALS3 correlated positively with the BMI, whereas SLC16A3 positively correlated with age 345 (Figure 4 E-J). In summary, these findings suggest that higher BMI and older age lead to higher 346 expression of CD147-related genes on immune cells, but not on the barrier cells, which potentially 347 can influence the development and the course of COVID-19. COVID-19 pandemic is developing at such a pace that extraordinary actions are being initiated to 363 learn quickly about its biology, transmission and potential means of prevention and treatment. In 364 this spirit, we first performed an extensive literature and database search and curated a list of proven 365 and potential receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and interaction partners, whose expression in different 366 tissues and cells might be involved in the course of immunological response in COVID-19 ( Figure 6 ) 367 55 . Next, we analyzed these genes in the broad spectrum of cell types and tissues in healthy controls 368 to evaluate the level of their expression and their co-expression profiles, as well as evaluated their 369 expression in healthy children, adolescents and adults. While interesting associations were observed 370 to be age-dependent, these findings must be further explored and repeated due to the possibility of 371 batch-specific systematic variations in the gene expression values between in-house and public 372 datasets. Despite our efforts in applying identical data analysis workflow for the datasets produced 373 by our group and those available in public repositories, different sequencing facilities and experiment 374 protocols can lead to altered gene expression values, especially for genes with extreme gene length 375 and G/C content. Finally, we analyzed gene expression in adults with known and potential COVID-19 376 comorbidities and risk factors such as COPD, asthma, hypertension, obesity, smoking, male gender 377 and AD. These conditions can be directly compared, as they were performed internally in the context 378 of same project. 379 ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 3 , whereas TMPRSS2 is a transmembrane host protease, 380 which cleaves the viral spike protein thus facilitating virus fusion to the cellular membranes process 381 (S) 3,56 . SLC6A19, physiologically a neutral amino acid transporter, potentially can block the access of 382 TMPRSS2 to ACE2 and subsequently reduce active infection 4,6 . Our results, in agreement with recent 383 reports 6,57,58 , indicate that airway epithelium has high ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression, and no 384 expression of protective SLC6A19 and thus might be highly susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 385 addition, it has been shown recently that ACE2 is highly expressed in naso-and oropharynx, which 386 are the sites of active SARS-CoV-2 replication and a main source of infectious particles 6,57,58 . 387",

We have not observed the expression of SLC6A19 in any of the analyzed cells and tissues, yet it is 391 known to be expressed is intestine 59 . Interestingly, in contrast to Leung and colleagues 60 , we have 392 not seen higher expression of ACE2 in HBECs or bronchial biopsy of patients with COPD, but our 393 sample size was very limited, and potentially a bronchial biopsy site was different, which might be 394 the reason of this inconsistency. However, consistently with this report 61 , we observed higher 395 expression of ACE2 in the bronchial biopsy of current smokers, which might indicate that current 396 smoking status, might be a stronger factor of increased ACE2 expression in airway epithelium than 397 COPD per se. On the other hand, ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2) were reported to 398 protect from severe acute lung injury in mice 62 , therefore an importance of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 399 infection and COVID-19 progression should be further explored. In addition, in HBECs of patients with 400 asthma, we observed higher expression of TMPRSS2, which increases the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 401 cleavage in asthmatic bronchi. Even though initially asthma was not reported to be a significant 402 comorbidity for COVID-19, more observations from Europe and the US seem to show otherwise 63 . It 403 might be related to the heterogeneity of asthma endotypes type 2 asthma (allergic) and non-type 2 404 (non-allergic). Allergen exposure, allergic sensitization and high IgE lead to lower ACE2 expression in 405 the nasal and bronchial epithelium of asthma patients 64 . Thus, it is possible that ACE2 expression in 406 the airways of allergic patients, even if slightly protective in terms of infection with SARS-CoV-2, 407 might also predispose to faster progression of COVID-19 to more severe forms, especially in case of 408 higher TMPRSS2 expression. 409",

Here, we report high expression of CD147 in both, epithelial tissues and innate 414 and adaptive immune cells.

Obesity is one of 420 the main comorbidities reported in patients with severe COVID-19 63 , and since CD147 expression in 421 the whole blood correlates positively with BMI in our cohort, it certainly needs further attention in 422 relation to COVID-19. Importantly, CD147 expression is upregulated by high glucose concentrations 423 66 , which might reflect its correlation with obesity, and potentially also with diabetes, another very The differential profile of ACE2-, CD147-and CD26-related gene expression in healthy subjects 465 of different ages need to be interpreted with caution due to the distinct origins of these populations, 466 as well as potential experimental bias (even if we performed normalization strategies, similar 467 bioinformatic pipelines and cautious assessment of raw data quality, prior to analysis). Nevertheless, 468 our observations are largely in agreement with other recent findings correlating gene expression in 469 the whole blood and PBMCs with age 79 . Having this in mind, it is intriguing to observe that expression 470 of NOD2, some MCTs, integrins and NFATs seemed to increase with age, whereas the expression of 471 genes coding g-secretase complex is decreasing with age in PBMCs. CD44 and MCT4 also correlated 472 with age in BAL and blood, respectively. Moreover, some of the differences between children and 473 adults, such as higher expression of CD26, CD44, GLUT1 (SLC2A1) and specific NFATs in adults were 474 also observed in na\u00efve purified CD4 + T cells.

Additionally, extracellular ligands and transmembrane partners of 425 CD147 participate in the progress of other viral infections 12 in variety of mechanisms. Viruses 426 integrate cyclophilin A and cyclophilin B in their virions and further can bind and either infect cells 427 via 147 or activate CD147 signaling 11-13 . We found that expression of both cyclophilins (PPIA and 428 PPIB) is increased in subjects with hypertension and obesity and PPIA correlated positively with BMI 429 in the whole blood, which is confirmed in other studies 67 . In addition, nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV binds 430 to CD147 via cyclophilins and reduces interferon responses 25 in infected cells. It also inhibits NF-ATs 431 translocation activation in T cells, leading to suppression of immune responses 25,68 . Both 432 mechanisms might be more potent in obese patients, especially with hypertension, due to higher 433 expression of both cyclophilins on the periphery. Also, the other extracellular ligand of CD147-434 S100A9 correlated positively with BMI. CD147 transmembrane partners such as LGALS3, MCT4 435 (SLC16A3), MCT2 (SLC16A7), ITGA3 and NFATC1 were elevated in the blood or BAL of obese or 436 hypertensive individuals, as well as the expression of LGALS3, S100A9 and CD44 correlated positively 437 with BMI. Importantly in individuals who are current smokers S100A9 and CD44 are elevated in the 438 BAL and in the blood. MCTs regulate the transport of lactate, pyruvate and ketone bodies across the 439 cell membrane 69 . Galectin-3 (LGALS3) via CD147 signaling is responsible for disrupting cell-cell 440 contact at the epithelial barriers 70 . CD44 in acute inflammation triggered by hyaluronic acid lead to 441 the cell activation and release of many proinflammatory cytokines whereas in the longer terms 442 induce lung fibrosis 71,72 . Interestingly, it has been shown that patients who recovered from SARS-443 CoV have spike protein-specific memory cytotoxic T cells, which express CD44 73 . Thus, our results 444 suggest a possible role of CD147 and its extracellular and intracellular ligands in COVID-19 445 pathogenesis via regulation of cell metabolism, motility and activation, especially in patients with 446 comorbidities. A clinical trial with anti-CD147 in COVID-19 patients seems to confirm its pleiotropic 447 role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it requires further research to investigate the involved mechanisms 448 and molecules. 449 Finally, expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2, CD147-and CD26-related genes in the skin biopsies 450 highlights the potential roles of these molecules in various viral diseases. Recent studies reported 451 that many COVID-19 cases developed nonpruritic, erythematous rashes, urticaria or varicella-like 452 lesions 54,74 , but so far it is not known if they are a place of viral replication or just a local reaction to 453 systemic infection. Similarly, not much is yet known about the potential connections between AD 454 and the course of COVID-19 75 . Yet, severe and untreated AD is a known risk factor for disseminated 455 viral skin disease 76 . Therefore, our observations indicating higher expression of cyclophilins, CD44, 456 S100A9, integrins, MCTs and other CD147-related genes require further studies about their role in 457 the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy subjects and in AD patients. 458 CD26 (DPP4) is another receptor important in coronavirus infection, described in MERS-CoV, 459 potentially recognizing SARS-CoV-2 21,77 . Similar to CD147, CD26 was expressed in all investigated cell 460 types, except B cells. ILCs showed highest expression of DPP4 from all analyzed cells, which is in 461 agreement with recent findings 78 . However, not much is known about the variable expression of 462 CD26 among ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3. Potentially, a high level of CD26 on the surface of ILCs in the lung 463 may be another mechanism of systemic spread of the virus. 464",
