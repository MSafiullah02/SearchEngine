Panel A shows distributions of COVID-19 cases within mainland China. Darker dots indicate larger numbers of COVID-19 cases. Up until February 9th, 118 cities have reported 1\u20139 cases; 174 cities have reported 10\u201399 cases; 28 cities have reported 100\u2013499 cases; 5 cities have reported 500\u2013999 cases; and 6 cities have reported \u22651000 cases. Panel B shows flight destinations and frequencies from Wuhan. Panel C shows bus destinations and frequencies from Wuhan. Panel D shows train destinations and frequencies from Wuhan. Higher weights of lines indicate higher frequencies. Panel E shows the correlation coefficients of daily frequencies of each transportation methods from Wuhan and the distance between Wuhan and other cities, with the daily number of COVID-19 cases. Panel F shows the correlation coefficients of daily frequencies of each transportation methods from Wuhan and the distance between Wuhan and other cities, with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases.
