As of the 11 July 2003, 1755 cases had been identified in Hong Kong, with 298 deaths (including eight health care workers).

In addition, given that the mode of transmission of the SARS virus is by droplet, it is important to take appropriate isolation precautions with patients suspected with SARS, with guidance from the CDC and the WHO (see http://www.cdc.gov.ncidod.sars.ic.htm and http://www.who.int/csr/sars/ic.htm, respectively). The general practice in hospitals was to use protective barrier (e.g. N\u201095 mask, goggles or face shields, gloves and protective apparel or gown). Wearing gloves, however, does not replace the need for hand washing. Frequent hand washing may be the one of the most important measures to reduce the risks of transmitting the SARS virus from one person or site to another. Because the main mode of transmission of the virus is by droplet, treatment with a nebulizer is avoided in patients with fever and chest X\u2010ray infiltrates.",

The large number of patients requiring intensive care also resulted in demands to double the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Converting other clinical bed areas into ICU beds was an enormous task, requiring additional equipment and human resources. The already limited number of ICU\u2010trained nurses meant that nurses from general wards had been deployed to work in these high\u2010technology units even without ICU training and experience. Nurses\u2019 deployment created more work for the ICU nurses who already had a heavy workload taking care of SARS victims and mentoring these nurses. However, the deployed nurses, although willing to help out, remained anxious about their competency to work in ICU.",

Nurses reported feeling exhausted from working extra shifts and concern because of the apparent lack of progress in many of their patients. The atmosphere in the clinical area was often demoralizing to nurses as they saw colleagues, relatives and friends amongst patients in their care. In order to support staff, hospitals established a counselling \u2018hot\u2010line\u2019 and provided intensive training and preceptorship programmes for new nurses working in ICU.

To minimize the chance of cross infection and to allow hospital staff to concentrate their efforts to deal with the crisis, clinical teaching at all hospitals was suspended from the beginning of the outbreak.

To achieve this, alternative means of updating and assessing students\u2019 clinical knowledge and skills were considered, and the school's laboratories were used to facilitate clinical practice and assessment.

Students\u2019 morale was affected as many felt powerless as to how they could help in this difficult situation.

A proliferation of e\u2010mails about the outcome of the disease circulating amongst health care workers and the general public exacerbated the situation. Information about whether to wear masks provides an illustration. The Department of Health continued to state that masks were only necessary for those people with respiratory infections or caring for sick people whereas other health professionals stated that masks should be worn by everyone at all times. Such messages contributed to uncertainty and created feelings of stigmatization amongst people choosing not to wear masks, mimicking some of the fear and stigma experienced when HIV first emerged as a disease.",

This reaffirmation has highlighted the importance of the partnership of health policy and health education in public health. Policy implications were highlighted in the cleansing of public areas and building regulations as well at a more micro level to ensure that all schools provide soap for children after using the toilet. It perhaps also highlighted the complexity of providing healthy high density housing, particularly as there were far fewer cases of SARS in particular areas of Hong Kong. Health education was identified as playing a significant role in containing the spread of the disease in the community. Health education strategies not only targeted all individuals, whether at home or work, in terms of personal hygiene, but also life style to ensure that people maximized their level of immunity; apparently essential to the prevention of SARS.",

Firstly, it has highlighted the need to revisit the range of public policies affecting health to ensure the community is protected by these policies. Building regulations provide one such example. Secondly, it has highlighted the strength of community action in managing such health issues. At a macro level, activities such as Project Shield have allowed members of the community and the private sector to come together to provide protective clothing for health care workers. At a micro level, a range of strategies have been implemented to improve the health of a community. An example is the joint initiative, supported by a grant from local government, involving a women's cooperative and unemployed people that provides older people with correctly diluted bleach for home cleansing. The Nethersole School of Nursing has tried to play a part by working with local schools and community centres in health education and SARS prevention, teaching people how to wash their hands, wear gloves and masks, answering queries and responding to concerns. Finally, the SARS outbreak has put public health firmly back on the health care agenda.",
