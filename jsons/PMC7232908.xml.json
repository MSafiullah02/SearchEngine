The epidemiological picture is constantly evolving, and on 13 May, 4,170,424 cases and 287,399 confirmed deaths have been reported (WHO Report). People with COVID-19 infection may show several symptoms, including fever, cough, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, and rarely arthritis [1]. COVID-19 clinical features range from asymptomatic patients to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction [2, 3]. Influenza symptoms are associated with a cascade of inflammatory mediators. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1) levels in plasma and upper respiratory secretions directly correlate with the magnitude of viral replication, fever, and respiratory and systemic symptoms, including musculoskeletal clinical manifestations [4, 5] Musculoskeletal symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia are common COVID-19 symptoms, but their prevalence has not yet been systematically investigated [6, 7]. We collected the published clinical data of the past 5 months to ascertain the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms and epidemiological characteristics published worldwide in COVID-19 patients.",

Most studies originate from China, which is not surprising, and it is not clear whether the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms at onset is influenced by socio-geographical factors [64].

Musculoskeletal symptoms should be married with laboratory findings, such as inflammatory and infection-related parameters (Interleukin-6, Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein). Understandably, the involvement of the musculoskeletal system has not been deeply investigated during this pandemic, but synovial and muscle biopsy, and joint fluid analysis, for example, should clarify how extensive the attack of the virus on the whole of the human body is. Until now, no report has been published on the presence of COVID-19 in the skeletal muscles, joint, or bones. The musculoskeletal symptoms are only anecdotally attributed to indirect effects, mainly arising from inflammatory and/or immune response, but other mechanisms can be hypothesized, such as direct damage by the virus on the endothelium or peripheral nerves. These findings could help to plan specific rehabilitation protocols in COVID-19 patients.",
