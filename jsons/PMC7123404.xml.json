These nanostructures with controlled size and geometry display some unique characteristics and functions that are important for the design and development of advanced devices and systems [4, 5, 7]. In particular, the one-dimensional structures such as fibers and wires due to their large aspect ratio and surface area have attracted great attentions of researchers and are being considered as building blocks for nanoscale electronics and electrochemical devices [8\u201310]. The geometry and size of these nanostructured fibers ensure that the fibers display enhanced electrical conductivity and thermal transport characteristics. The nanostructured fibers also show good interaction with surrounding matrix and therefore are used to enhance its mechanical stiffness and strength [6, 10\u201312].",

            "text": "Among all the fabrication techniques used to produce one-dimensional fibers and wires, electrospinning is regarded as a simple and efficient technique to produce continuous fibers with controlled dimensions from a range of organic and inorganic materials [13\u201315]. Also, electrospinning can be used to obtain fibers with various structures and morphologies [16\u201318]. For example, modifying the conventional electrospinning setup and using a coaxial spinneret can yield core\u2013shell or hollow fibers [19, 20]. Similarly, modifying the collector used in conventional electrospinning can lead to the collection of yarns or aligned fibers [15, 21]. Fibers with unique surface structures can also be obtained by decorating the surface of the fibers with nanoparticles or by introducing substructures on the surface of the fibers [22, 23]. Introduction of such nanoscale features on the surface of the fibers can greatly impact the surface properties of the fibers, which can expand their applications. In particular, inorganic metal oxide fibers obtained using electrospinning of precursor metal oxide salts followed by thermal annealing display some unique morphology on the fiber surfaces [13, 24]. Such fibers with high surface area and interconnected porosity are technologically important materials for various functional applications. For example, it is reported that the charge transport in metal oxide fibers can be a few orders of magnitude higher than that in their counterparts which are based on nanoparticles [8, 11]. Similarly, metal oxide fibers have been actively investigated for novel electrode materials for electrochemical storage devices [12, 25]. Thus, metal oxide fibers have found applications in nanoelectronics, sensors, fuel cells, solar cells, catalysis, hydrogen storage batteries, etc. [26\u201331].",

They have gone even further to fabricate hybrid and hierarchical ceramic and metal oxide fibers [18, 36], hollow and core\u2013shell ceramic fibers [7, 37], porous ceramic fibers, and carbon nanotube-filled ceramic fibers [38]. Recently, some researchers have also fabricated hierarchical fibers by growing substructures on the surface of inorganic fibers. For example, electrospinning and hydrothermal treatment have been applied to grow ZnO nanostructures on the surface of Co3O4 fibers [39]. In a similar way, Ostermann et al. [36] fabricated nanorod-on-fiber structures by growing V2O5 nanorods on the surface of TiO2 fibers.",

Typically, two different processing techniques are used in the preparation of the sol solution. The first approach is based on hydroxylation and condensation of molecular precursors [44].

            "text": "The second approach is a common technique that is used to fabricate ceramic or metal oxide fibers. Typically, to obtain such inorganic fibers, metal salt precursors are dispersed homogeneously in a solvent [34, 42, 44]. Then, a suitable polymer is dissolved in this solvent to prepare the solution for electrospinning. Electrospinning this solution with metal salts and polymer leads to polymer fibers with well-dispersed metal oxide precursor, which can be thermally annealed to reduce the precursor to ceramic or metal oxide. Finally, the polymer is removed to obtain neat metal oxide or ceramic fibers. To obtain continuous and uniform ceramic fibers, it is essential that the weight ratio of the precursor to polymer in electrospinning be between 50 and 80%. As an example, this approach is used to fabricate bismuth ferrite fibers [34]. Here, Bi(NO3)3.5H2O and Fe(NO3)3.9H2O are chosen as the precursor salts which are dispersed in a solution mixture of 2-methoxyethanol and glacial acetic acid. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is dissolved in a dimethylformamide/ethanol solution mixture. Finally, the precursor solution mixture and the PVP solution are blended and electrospun to obtain homogenous precursor fibers. Thermal annealing of these fibers produces neat BiFeO3 fibers. We have also used this method to fabricate barium titanate (BaTiO3) fibers [27]. A solgel solution is first prepared by adding known quantities of barium acetate, titanium isopropoxide, and acetic acid. This solution is then added into a PVP\u2013ethanol solution and electrospun to obtain the precursor fibers. Figure 1.1a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of precursor fibers. The fibers are thermally annealed to obtain BaTiO3 fibers. Figure 1.1b, c shows the SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the obtained fibers. It is evident from Fig. 1.1b, c that BaTiO3 fibers are made of many fine-grained structures [27].\n",

For example, TiO2 precursor with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) polymer is electrospun and thermally annealed to obtain TiO2 fibers. It is shown that during annealing, the polymer is removed and the size of the fibers is reduced [38, 45, 46]. Polycrystalline TiO2 fibers are obtained after the thermal annealing stage, and the crystalline phase formation is determined by the annealing temperature used. TiO2 fibers with anatase phase are obtained when the annealing temperature is 510 \u00b0C. This anatase phase is converted to a rutile phase if 800 \u00b0C for 3 h is used for annealing [47]. Similar observations are noted for WO3 fibers [48, 49]. Either tetragonal or orthorhombic phases are obtained that depend on the temperature used for annealing.",

By using this approach, the variability that is associated with solgel hydrolyzing time can be avoided. However, with this technique, it is crucial to disperse the nanoparticles uniformly in the polymer solution such that polymer fibers with uniformly filled particles can be obtained. Studies also report that the size of nanoparticles used influences their aggregation in the polymer fibers [54]. For homogenous particle dispersion, it is important that the particles and the polymer share a common solvent [52]. For example, silica nanoparticles can be dispersed homogeneously in water-soluble polymers [52]. However, the fibers obtained using water-soluble polymers are often cross-linked to expand their applications that involve the use of water. Newsome et al.

However, the particles tend to aggregate and cannot be homogeneously dispersed in the electrospinning solution, making it difficult to obtain uniform fibrous structures after the sintering process. Similar to the method of dispersing nanoparticles in the polymer solution, inorganic fibers fabricated using gas\u2013solid reaction method are obtained by first dissolving the doped precursor particles of metal or metal oxide into the electrospinning polymer solution [42]. Then, gas\u2013solid reaction treatment is applied to the fibers to synthesize metal or metal oxide particles within the polymer fibrous matrix. The polymer matrix can then be removed to obtain neat metal or metal oxide particles as fibers. Lu et al. [55] dispersed lead acetate in PVP polymer solution and electrospun to obtain PVP/lead acetate fibers. These fibers are then exposed to H2S gas to convert lead acetate to PbS. Thus, after gas treatment, PbS nanoparticles dispersed in PVP are obtained. In a similar study [56], a solution consisting of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) is prepared and electrospun to obtain AgNO3\u2013PAN fibers and exposed to HCl gas. The exposure to HCl synthesized AgCl particles and led to the collection of PAN fibers filled with AgCl particles with uniform size. It is further shown that the size and density of the particles with in the PAN fibers can be controlled by adjusting the AgNO3 concentration within the electrospinning solution. Other researchers have used this gas\u2013solid reaction method to obtain neat metallic or metal oxide fibers. Hence, Bognitzki et al. [57] dispersed copper nitrate in a poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) solution that was electrospun to obtain copper nitrate\u2013PVB fibers. These fibers are then thermally treated to remove the polymer and subsequently annealed in hydrogen atmosphere at 300 \u00b0C to obtain neat copper fibers.",

            "text": "Recently, emulsion electrospinning has been increasingly used to fabricate inorganic fibers [23, 42, 58]. This technique is similar to conventional electrospinning; however, a water-in-oil emulsion is used instead of a solution. Electrospinning this emulsion results in the separation of the phases within the fibers. Hence, this technique is useful to obtain highly porous fibers or hollow tubes. It eliminates the need of a complex coaxial spinneret to obtain core\u2013shell fibers. With this technique, two different polymer solutions are first prepared and mixed to form an emulsion, followed by electrospinning to obtain fibers with two separated polymer phases. Lu et al. [23] used emulsion electrospinning to prepare highly porous TiO2 nanotubes that are decorated with WO3 nanoparticles on the internal and external sidewalls of the nanotubes. In their study, a solution consisting of titanium acetate and PVP solution is prepared. To this viscous gel, known quantity of viscous oil is added to prepare the emulsion. This emulsion is then electrospun into fibers that are thermally treated to obtain porous TiO2 nanotubes. Typically, in this process, oil along with the solvent evaporates from the surface of the fibers once the jet is ejected from the electrospinning nozzle. This produces a region near the surface of the fibers that is rich in PVP and precursor salts. The residual oil gathers at the inner regions of the fiber to obtain core\u2013shell fibers. When the fibers are thermally annealed, the oil present in the core region of the fibers is removed and hollow nanotubes are obtained. Following this step, Lu et al. [23] used a thermal evaporation method to deposit tungsten carbide nanoparticles on the inside as well as outside walls of the hollow fibers. The fibers are then thermally treated in air to convert tungsten carbide particles to WO3 particles. This has led to the synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes decorated with WO3 nanoparticles. A similar fabrication technique is used in another study [58] to obtain porous TiO2 fibers.",

Apart from tailoring the electrospinning variables, the morphologies of ceramic fibers which are obtained using the solgel route are also influenced by the heating rate, cooling rate, and the atmosphere in which the sample is annealed. Fibers consisting of multi-grain structures can be developed by controlling the annealing temperature. It is reported that the size of the particles increases with annealing temperature. Hence, the use of high temperature causes crystallization and allows the grains to coalesce. For example, Xia et al. [61] investigated the effect of thermal annealing temperature on the morphology of SrTiO3 fibers. Their results demonstrate that when the precursor fibers are thermally annealed at 800 \u00b0C, the morphology of the fibers is smooth and homogeneous. However, when the thermal annealing temperature is increased to 900 or 1000 \u00b0C, coarse fibers are obtained due to the irregular growth of the particles within the fibers. Figure 1.3 shows a BaTiO3 coarse fiber obtained by controlling the annealing temperature. When 750 \u00b0C is used for annealing, the fibers have a continuous surface structure (see Fig. 1.3a). However, coarse fibers are obtained when the annealing temperature is increased.\n",

However, when polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) was used in the electrospinning solution instead of PVP, rice-shaped fibers were obtained. They also showed that leaf-like TiO2 fibers could be obtained when both PVAc and PVP were used as the polymer in the electrospinning solution. They argued that the chemical nature of the polymer used in the electrospinning solution and the interactions between the polymer and the inorganic precursor defined the morphology of the ceramic fibers. For example, the hydrolysis of precursor metal oxide occurs when it is dissolved in polar PVP in a solvent. The hydroxyl groups of the precursor metal salts interact with PVP via hydrogen bonding. This suggests that the precursor metal oxide is attached to PVP, and hence, it assumes the shape of the fibers. Therefore, after thermal annealing treatment, the metal oxide retains the uniform and continuous shape. Rice-shaped fibers (Fig. 1.4) are obtained when PVP is replaced by PVAc. These unique shaped structures are caused by the reduced chemical interaction of the metal oxide precursor with PVAc. Microscale phase separation happens when the fibers are annealed. One phase is rich in metal oxide domains while the other phase is predominantly PVAc domains. The coexistence of these two phases within the fiber prolongs these domains during annealing, leading to the formation of rice-like structures of the metal oxide. Lastly, leaf-shaped structures can be obtained when a mixture of PVP and PVAc is used to electrospin TiO2 fibers. The metal oxide precursor interacts with both PVP and PVAc at the same time. Thus, when these fibers are thermally annealed, the anisotropy in TiO2 morphology leads to the formation of the leaf-like structures. Similar results are reported by Jo et al. [24] in their study which investigated the effect of polymer type used in the solgel solution that was used to prepare the inorganic fibers. The miscibility of the polymer with the precursor solgel and its interaction with the precursor metal oxide define the morphology of the fibers.\n",

It can be used to produce fibers with high surface area to volume ratio compared to fibers prepared using the conventional electrospinning approach. In this approach, the emulsion solution used to prepare the fibers is the key factor that controls the fiber porosity. Lu et al. [58] used this method to prepare highly porous TiO2 fibers. First, PVP\u2013titanium acetate solution is prepared that forms a viscous gel. Then, a homogeneous and stable gel is prepared by adding a known quantity of mineral oil to the PVP\u2013titanium acetate gel solution which can be used for electrospinning. When the fibers are ejected from the nozzle, the oil present on the fiber surface and the solvent evaporates. The evaporation of the solvent from the fiber surface ensures that the surface comprises PVP and precursor of the metal oxide. This leads to the formation of core\u2013shell fibers with oil present in the core region of the fiber, while the outer shell consists of PVP and metal oxide precursor. When the oil from the inner core is evaporated, PVP hollow tubes and metal oxides are deposited on the collector. Finally, TiO2 nanotubes are produced when the obtained fibers are annealed. Porous nanotubes are obtained during this process because the residual oil present in the shell region of the fiber is evaporated during thermal treatment. Uniformly distributed pores with 12 nm diameter are found on the surface of the fiber. A similar approach is used by Liu et al. [62] to produce porous TiO2 fibers. They argue that the presence of tiny droplets of mineral oil in the surface region of the fibers is responsible for the porosity. Similarly, Chen et al. [46] prepared porous TiO2 fibers using microemulsion combined with electrospinning. PVP and metal oxide precursor are first dissolved in a solvent solution to which paraffin oil is added to prepare the microemulsion mixture. The solution is then electrospun to obtain the precursor fibers. Paraffin oil is dispersed within the fibers and serves as the pore-forming agent. Metal oxide precursors are the matrix phase. During subsequent annealing, paraffin oil is removed and pores are formed. They explained that the multi-scale porous structures are obtained because paraffin oil droplets merge during electrospinning to form different sizes of the droplets. Thus, multi-scale porous structures are obtained when the fibers are thermally annealed.",

Here, the fabrication of polymer fibrous membrane using electrospinning is first effected. These polymer fibers are used as templates. Precursors of the inorganic materials are then coated on the surface of these fibers. Following this step, the polymer core is selectively removed or etched away to obtain hollow ceramic or metal oxide fibers. Choi et al. [63], in their study, used this approach to fabricate hollow fibers with several centimeters in length and submicron diameters. The wall thickness of the hollow fibers is several tens of nanometers. Briefly, electrospinning is used in the first step to obtain polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) fibers that serve as sacrificial templates. Then, precursor materials of inorganic zinc oxide (ZnO) are used to coat the fibers by physical vapor deposition. Finally, the fibers are thermally treated to decompose the PVAc core and obtain inorganic ZnO as the shell.",

This straightforward approach uses a coaxial spinneret to produce core\u2013shell fibers. Here, two immiscible solutions are fed independently into the core and shell capillaries of the coaxial spinneret. It is critical that the core and shell solutions are immiscible to obtain well-defined coaxial fibers. Typically, the precursor for the inorganic material is fed into the shell capillary and mineral oil into the core capillary of the coaxial setup. The fiber formation mechanism is similar to that of conventional electrospinning. When a voltage is applied, the solution ejected from the spinneret is electrically charged and the electrostatic forces stretch the jet to form the fibers. The solution emanating from the inner capillary of the spinneret is stretched due to the shear stresses developed from stretching of the shell solution. Once the fibers are formed, they are heat treated to remove the mineral oil from the core region of the fiber and obtain the inorganic shell phase. Li et al. [33] used this method to produce hollow TiO2 fibers. Figure 1.6 shows the SEM image of the hollow fibers obtained using this technique.\n",

A higher feeding rate of the mineral oil results in hollow fibers with thin walls. However, only some segments of the fibers are seen to be hollow when the feeding rate of the mineral oil is low. Zhang et al. [66] used this approach to fabricate hollow TiO2 fibers. Briefly, the precursor material consisting of titanium isopropoxide and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is dissolved in a solvent. This solution is fed to the shell capillary, while heavy mineral oil is fed to the inner core capillary. The as-spun fibers are immersed in octane for 12 h to remove the heavy mineral oil. Following this, the fibers are thermally treated to obtain crystalline hollow TiO2 fibers whose diameter is determined by the concentration of PVP used in the precursor solution. Researchers have also demonstrated that hollow inorganic fibers can be obtained using conventional single spinneret electrospinning. In this process, the inorganic precursor solution is mixed with two different polymer solutions. For this purpose, immiscible polymers are chosen such that they phase separate during electrospinning. Thus, Zhang et al. [67] prepared a solution consisting of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), PVP, and zinc acetate. Fibers are then formed using conventional electrospinning. Their results indicate that due to phase separation, PAN forms the core of the fiber, while PVP and zinc acetate constitute the fiber shell. Hollow zinc oxide (ZnO) fibers are obtained after thermal treatment and after the polymer phases are burnt off.",

Conversely, when the solutions with high electrical conductivity are electrospun, the jet motion is dominated by the random whipping instabilities and aligning the fibers becomes difficult.

The counter electrode has a grounded coin placed 3 cm away from the tip which, in turn, is dipped into the electrospinning solution such that a small droplet sits on the surface of the tip. When a high voltage is applied, bundles of aligned fibers are formed between the tip and the grounded electrode. The jet ejected from the Taylor cone is pulled toward the ground electrode without any bending. The jet is stretched between the tip and the grounded collector.

By controlling the annealing temperature and time, V2O5 nanorods can be grown on the surface of TiO2 fibers. In the first step, the precursors of both V2O5 and TiO2 are mixed in PVP solution. This solution is then electrospun to obtain PVP fibers with precursors of V2O5 and TiO2. During annealing, both V2O5 and TiO2 phases begin to crystallize. But their difference in crystallization results in phase separation, forming a unique morphology [36] which can be tailored by controlling the concentration of TiO2 precursor in the electrospinning solution and annealing temperature. Thinner and more uniform V2O5 nanorods are grown on TiO2 fiber surface when a lower annealing temperature is used.",

The electrospinning solution prepared consisted of 4 components, viz. polyacrylonitrile (PAN), PVP, precursor solution of ZnAc2, and precursor solution of SnCl4. Due to the differences in the viscosities of PAN and PVP, and their immiscibility, the lower viscosity of PVP forms the continuous phase while the higher viscosity solution of PAN forms the droplets, which leads to the formation of core\u2013shell fibers [35]. When this solution is electrospun, electrical forces act on the outer continuous phase while the inner phase only experiences shear force that is applied on its surface due to the flow of the outer continuous phase. Figure 1.11 shows the TEM image of the PAN\u2013PVP core\u2013shell fibers. Inorganic precursors along with PVP formed the shell and the PAN formed the core in the core\u2013shell structures. Thermally annealing these fibers carbonized the PAN in the core region and led to the formation of ZnO and SnO2 nanoparticles on the surface of the fibers. It is further shown that the concentration of the nanoparticles on the surface of the fibers can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of the precursors in the initial solgel solutions.\n",

Membranes based on nanofibers have shown some promising applications as filters that are capable of intercepting Escherichia coli, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and influenza A (H1N1) virus [82\u201384]. The membranes based on fibers can also be used as N95 respirator mask if the channels and the size of the structural elements match the size of the particulates that are to be captured [85]. The efficiency of the filter can be improved if the size of the fibers within the membranes is reduced to nanoscale dimensions. It is argued that fibers of finer diameters have better filtration performance with no change in permeability compared to micron size fibers [85]. The membrane based on electrospun fibers not only has high permeability but also is capable of capturing dust particles due to its small pore size. The dust particles can later be removed by reversing the air flow through it or by other mechanical methods. Although electrospun membranes based on polymers are widely used for air filtration applications, their applications are limited due to the low thermal stability of the polymers. Hence, they cannot be used as high-temperature filter membranes. However, membranes based on inorganic materials owing to their chemical and thermal stability can function at high temperatures and are being increasingly used for such filtration applications. The functionality of the inorganic membranes can be further improved by addressing their brittleness.",

Typically, a mesoporous layer of 1\u201310 \u00b5m thickness acts as an active sensing layer. This layer consists of sintered and interconnected nanometer-sized particles. The sensing mechanisms are based on the diffusion-reaction mechanisms. The gas molecules diffuse into the layer and interact with some of the pre-adsorbed O-adions that are present on the surface of the nanoparticles. This is known to affect the charge transfer interaction between nanoparticles and the gas adsorbates, which in turn affects the electrical resistance of the sensing layer. By monitoring the electrical resistance, the changes in the surrounding gas composition can be traced. Thus, having a porous sensing layer improves the sensitivity as it enables gas penetration and exchange. Conventional techniques used to prepare the porous layers limit their gas sensing abilities due to the difficulty for the gas to diffuse into the inner regions of the layers.",

[58] used emulsion electrospinning to fabricate porous TiO2 nanofibers and showed their use for water treatment. The porous TiO2 fibers have large surface area and a combination of anatase and rutile crystal phases which can improve the efficiency of the photocatalysis due to efficient separation of mixed electrons and holes. Zhan et al. [37] used the core\u2013shell electrospinning setup to produce hollow TiO2 fibers. Mesopores on the fibers are introduced with the help of pore-directing agent. They showed that these mesoporous TiO2 fibers exhibited higher photocatalytic behavior toward methylene blue degradation compared to commercial TiO2 nanoparticles and mesoporous TiO2 powders. The increased photocatalytic behavior of the mesoporous hollow TiO2 fibers is attributed to increased surface area. In yet another study, electrospun ZnO nanofibers are shown to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene in the presence of UV radiation [59]. Methods to further improve the photocatalytic activities of electrospun metal oxide fibers have been investigated. Typically, the photocatalytic activity can be reduced due to rapid recombination rate of the holes and the excited electrons. This issue can be resolved by doping the metal oxides with other transition metals. The dopants reduce the recombination rate of holes and excited electrons and increase the surface area.",

The high surface area and porous structures of the fibers have been found to be beneficial for energy storage and conversion [31, 42]. Electrospinning is increasingly investigated for fabrication of fibers for energy conservation applications such as fuel cells and solar cells as well as for energy storage applications such as supercapacitors. Electrospun fibers have been used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to enable conversion of light to electricity [24, 46, 89]. Porous metal oxide fibers are deposited on a transparent conducting glass to serve as the photoanodes in DSSCs. A photosensitizing dye is adsorbed on these semiconducting metal oxide fibers. Hence, when the dye absorbs the photons in these solar cells, the photoelectrons move into the conduction band of the semiconducting metal oxide fibers. These photoelectrons are collected on the photoanode and transferred to the counter electrode via an external circuit. The flow of electrons through the external circuit produces current. Studies demonstrate that the one-dimensional geometry of the fiber increases the energy efficiency due to better charge conduction [8, 29]. Porous metal oxide fibers such as TiO2 are widely investigated for photoanodes as the high surface area ensures that a larger amount of photosensitizing dye is absorbed.",

Among all types of fuel cells, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are widely investigated due to their low operating temperature and high power density [11, 26, 28]. Within these fuel cells, catalysts of platinum nanoparticles are loaded onto the supporting material. Studies demonstrate that the type of supporting material used has a great influence on the catalytic activity of the platinum nanoparticles. The criterion for selecting the supporting material for DMFCs is that the supporting material should have large surface area, stable, and electrically conductive. Electrospinning has been widely used to fabricate fibers as supporting materials in DMFCs. The 1D geometry of the fibers ensures the stability of the supporting material and plays a role in improving the performance of the resulting electrodes. Electrospun fibers based on carbon materials due to their ease in fabrication, low cost, and good electrical conductivity are used as catalyst support in DMFCs.",

Typically, the ceramic or metal oxide fibers obtained using electrospinning are polycrystalline. This is in contrast to the inorganic fibers fabricated using conventional techniques such as CVD where the material can be grown to consist of one single crystalline phase. The domain size in electrospinning can in some cases match the size of the fibers. This can provide additional functionality to the fibers as they demonstrate improved sensitivity. Hollow or porous fibers obtained using electrospinning have been widely used as electrodes in solar cells. It is also shown that the energy conversion efficiency of these fibers is significantly higher compared to other nanomaterials.",
