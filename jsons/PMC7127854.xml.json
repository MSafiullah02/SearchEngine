            "text": "Shigellosis is one of the most common causes of diarrhea in humans worldwide. The annual number of Shigella episodes throughout the world has been estimated to be 164.7 millions, of which 163.2 million have occurred in developing nations resulting in 1.1 million deaths (Kotloff et al., 1999). Humans and other primates are the only natural reservoirs for Shigella species (Niyogi, 2005). Epidemics usually occur in crowded areas with poor sanitary conditions where transmission from person to person is common, or when food or water is contaminated by the organism. Despite economic and public health improvements, outbreaks of shigellosis are still reported regularly (Anonymous, 1999a, Anonymous, 1999b, Gaynor et al., 2009, Kuo et al., 2009, Marcus et al., 2004, Morgan et al., 2006, Wei et al., 2007). A definitive diagnosis of shigellosis can be made by isolating the organism from a stool sample. In China, shigellosis has been ranked third in morbidity, following tuberculosis and hepatitis, and has become the number 1 cause of disease-related death in children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007, Mathers et al., 2009). Historically, there have been 4 subgroups of Shigella that have been described: subgroup A as S. dysenteriae, subgroup B as S. flexneri, subgroup C as S. boydii, and subgroup D as S. sonnei. Among these subgroups, the epidemic subgroup of diarrhea was typically S. sonnei in industrialized countries and S. flexneri in developing countries including the Beijing area for many years (Gupta et al., 2004, Kotloff et al., 1999, Qu et al., 2008, von Seidlein et al., 2006). However, cases of S. sonnei have noticeably increased and S. sonnei is becoming the dominant subgroup in Asian countries in recent years (Bangtrakulnonth et al., 2008, Filliol-Toutain et al., 2011, Kotloff et al., 1999, Mamishi et al., 2009, Orrett, 2008, Qu et al., 2008, Salmanzadeh-Ahrabi et al., 2007, Wei et al., 2007). It is necessary to explore the clinical importance of S. sonnei\u2013related infections because it can cause systematic infections such as bacteriemia and meningitis in immunocompromised individuals (Chapel et al., 2005). In addition, S. sonnei is often associated with international food-borne infection outbreaks by airline passengers, imported food, travelers, animals, and insect vectors. S. sonnei can also be sexually transmitted among homosexual males (Anonymous, 1999a, Anonymous, 1999b, Gaynor et al., 2009, Kuo et al., 2009, Marcus et al., 2004, Morgan et al., 2006, Okeke and Edelman, 2001, Salam and Bennish, 1991). S. sonnei remains a public health concern and has become a threat in both developed and developing nations.",

Another related reason might be that much fewer patients with diarrhea desired to go to the hospital, which decreased the chances of acquiring lethal SARS infections. Another important finding was that S. sonnei replaced S. flexneri to become the predominant subgroup causing shigellosis in the Beijing area, which was similar to the trends and patterns reported in industrialized countries (Bonfiglio et al., 2002, Ekdahl and Andersson, 2005, Filliol-Toutain et al., 2011, Gupta et al., 2004, Ozmert et al., 2011).",

In comparison, fosfomycin with good antibacterial activities in vitro and low incidence of adverse events can be used as an alternative treatment for diarrhea infection including in pediatric patients (Fukuyama et al., 2000, Michalopoulos et al., 2011), but chloramphenicol with lower level of resistance is rarely used in diarrhea patients in clinical settings because of its more adverse effects (Arjyal et al., 2011).",
