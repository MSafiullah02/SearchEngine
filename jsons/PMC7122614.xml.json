            "text": "There are three classes of antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of influenza: the M2 ion channel inhibitors (amantadine, rimantadine), the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (laninamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir), and the protease inhibitor (favipiravir); some of the agents are only available in selected countries [1, 2]. These agents are effective at treating the signs and symptoms of influenza in patients infected with susceptible viruses. Clinical failure has been demonstrated in patients infected with viruses with primary resistance, i.e., antivirals can be present in the virus initially infecting the patient, or resistance may emerge during the course of therapy [3\u20135]. NA inhibitors are active against all nine NA subtypes recognized in nature [6], including highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 and recent low-pathogenic avian influenza A/H7N9 viruses [7]. Since seasonal influenza is usually an acute, self-limited illness in which viral clearance usually occurs rapidly due to innate and adaptive host immune responses, the emergence of drug-resistant variants would be anticipated to have limited effect on clinical recovery in otherwise healthy patients, as has been demonstrated clinically [3, 8, 9]. Unfortunately, immunocompromised or immunologically na\u00efve hosts, such as young children and infants or those exposed to novel strains, are more likely to have mutations that confer resistance emergence during therapy; such resistant variants may also result in clinically significant adverse outcomes [10\u201313].",

Prior to being replaced by the pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 virus, most circulating seasonal A/H1N1 viruses in the 2008\u20132009 season contained the His275Tyr mutation and were therefore highly resistant to oseltamivir while retaining susceptibility to zanamivir. All currently circulating A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses have mutations conferring M2 inhibitor resistance. There is no data to date indicating that M2 inhibitor resistance is associated with worsened viral virulence, atypical influenza, or enhanced transmissibility. Sporadic viruses with primary resistance mutations resulting in neuraminidase inhibitor resistance have been described. Most but not all NA mutations conferring resistance in clinical isolates have been associated with reduced infectivity, replication, and pathogenicity in animal models of influenza. Such features are important not only in clinical management of individual patients but also are key factors that need to be considered by health authorities and governments when making decisions regarding the stockpiling of antivirals for response to pandemics or other influenza threats [14, 15]. Concerns about antiviral resistance, particularly to NA inhibitors, should not dissuade countries from developing adequate antiviral inventories for pandemic response [14, 16].",

            "text": "The frequency of resistance emergence during therapy is higher with M2 inhibitors than NA inhibitors. Development of resistance during the course of therapy was very common among initially M2 inhibitor-susceptible viruses in the past. Mutations in one of five amino acids in the M2 gene result in cross-resistance to both amantadine and rimantadine. Resistance emergence during therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors generally remains rare for circulating strains of A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses, with higher rates in children and immunocompromised patients. A common feature of patients who develop resistance despite ongoing therapy is high-level replication and longer duration of replication in the presence of antiviral therapy. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors results from mutations in the neuraminidase gene, the hemagglutinin gene, or both. The specific mutation determines the degree of resistance and which neuraminidase inhibitor has reduced susceptibility. Further, the frequency and magnitude of NA inhibitor resistance vary with drug, virus, and neuraminidase type and subtype. Resistance has been demonstrated to develop during the course of therapy with avian viruses, particularly A/H7N9, with greater frequency than seasonal human viruses. Compensatory mutations may also occur that improve the fitness and transmissibility of resistant viruses and may play a role in establishing persistent transmission, as was demonstrated with the seasonal A/H1N1 during the 2007\u20132008 and 2008\u20132009 seasons.",

Pyrosequencing methods for rapid analysis of mutations in the M2 gene associated with resistance have been described and are used in several reference laboratories [21, 38]. Neither assay is typically available in most clinical labs.

Several assays have been described including plaque reduction, yield reduction, and ELISA [39]. Following phenotypic analysis, genotypic M2 inhibitor resistance has been confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis of the M2 gene and detection of the characteristic mutations. Genotypic detection can be accomplished quickly by the use of PCR restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of RNA extracted from respiratory samples using commercially available endonucleases for discrimination of point mutations in the M2 gene [38, 40]. Greater sensitivity in detecting resistant clones has been described with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA followed by sequencing of multiple clones [4, 38, 41]. Recently, the rapid pyrosequencing technique has been shown to be a reliable, high-throughput method for detecting genotypic resistance in large numbers of community isolates [4, 29, 38].",

Even after licensure of the M2 inhibitors, there were low levels of primary resistance in community isolates (see Table 71.1). This began to change when field isolates of A/H3N2 viruses from China were noted to have a significant increase in the resistance to the M2 inhibitors, possibly related to increased use of over-the-counter amantadine after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [38]. During the 2004\u20132005 influenza season, approximately 70 % of the A/H3N2 isolates from China and Hong Kong and nearly 15 % of those from the United States and Europe showed resistance due to a Ser31Asn mutation, and this frequency increased to over 90 % in the United States during the 2005\u20132006 season [29, 38]. Since then, most clinical isolates of A/H3N2 were noted to have Ser31Asn mutations in the M gene conferring resistance to M2 inhibitors (Table 71.1). This spread occurred despite the absence of sustained selective drug pressure, possibly because the resistant M gene was incorporated into efficiently spreading HA antigenic variants. Phylogenetic analyses of the HA1 and M2 genes have suggested a common origin of these viruses [43]. This experience clearly indicates that this resistance mutation does not reduce transmissibility and is stable over time.\n",

A characteristic feature of A/H1N1, A/H1N2, and A/H3N2 swine viruses circulating in Europe since 1987 has been the presence of Ser31Asn mutation, as well as Lys27Ala in some isolates, that confers resistance to M2 inhibitors [46]. The postulated role of swine as intermediate hosts in the emergence of some novel human viruses and direct interspecies transmission from birds may be another mechanisms for a reassortment event leading to acquisition of an M gene encoding resistance in a human strain [47, 48].",

Another study found that 33 % of 24 adult and pediatric household members receiving rimantadine shed resistant virus on day 5 of treatment; none were positive when tested 5 days later [27]. A larger pediatric trial found emergence of resistant virus in 27 % of 37 rimantadine recipients, including 45 % of those still virus positive on day 7, compared to 6 % of 32 acetaminophen recipients [23]. Resistant virus was detected as early as day 3 in one child but was usually present on days 5\u20137. A study of Japanese children treated with amantadine found that 30 % of 81 in the 1999\u20132000 season and 23 % of 30 during the following season had resistant virus detected on day 3\u20135 after a 3-day course [53].

Another study employing sensitive molecular cloning detection methods found mutations conferring resistance in 80 % of 15 hospitalized children during or immediately after amantadine treatment [41]. Nine (75 %) of 12 children had 2\u20134 resistance mutations detected in clones from a single sample, sometimes mixed with wild-type virus. In a randomized study patients hospitalized with influenza were to receive either rimantadine alone or rimantadine plus nebulized zanamivir [54].

The median time between the first and last virus isolation was 7 days with range up to 44 days. Death associated with influenza occurred in 2 of 5 (40 %) patients with resistant virus, compared to 5 of 24 (21 %) without, and prolonged illness was noted in several with protracted shedding. Other reports have documented prolonged shedding of resistant variants in immunocompromised hosts with or without continued drug exposure, including one transplanted SCID child who shed for 5 weeks and one adult leukemia patient who shed resistant virus for \u22651 week of therapy [55]. Another case report documented recovery of resistant virus >1 month after cessation of a course of amantadine, as well as shedding of mixtures of wild-type virus and variants with different resistance genotypes [56]. Heterogeneous populations of resistant variants with sequential or dual mutations have been found in several immunocompromised hosts [28, 55]. One stem cell transplant recipient shed dually M2 inhibitor and oseltamivir-resistant virus for at least 5 months and probably over 1 year [57]. The prolonged shedding of resistant variants in immunocompromised hosts is consistent with the genetic stability of such variants observed in experimental animal models [51].",

In occasional patients wild-type virus replaces resistant variants after cessation of amantadine [41]. As noted for some avian A/H7 viruses, this reversion in the absence of selective drug pressure suggests diminished replication competence of some resistant genotypes. However, the most common resistant variant with Ser31Asn has no apparent loss of replication competence or transmissibility. In studies in birds and ferrets, influenza viruses with Val27Ala, Ala30Val, or Ser31Asn mutations had no impact of virulence, mortality, febrile responses, peak nasal viral titers, or nasal inflammatory cell counts [22, 51]. In general, it appears that M2 inhibitor-resistant human influenza A viruses that emerge in vivo do not differ substantially in replication ability or pathogenicity from drug-susceptible wild-type viruses, and resistance phenotypes were typically retained in the absence of drug.",

In addition, these types of assays are labor intense and require an additional virus titration step, which make these assays unfavorable for high-throughput surveillance. Humanized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines that stably overexpress human 2,6-sialyltransferase (SIAT1) to increase alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids may overcome this first limitation. However, these cells have not been widely utilized to date [100, 101]. Other challenges are the broad variation in morphology of influenza plaques between different influenza types and subtypes and the reduced sensitivity of yield reduction assays. The NA enzyme inhibition phenotypic assays have, therefore, been the preferred assay to screen for clinically relevant NA inhibitor resistance mutations in influenza antiviral resistance surveillance [5, 102, 103]. Both fluorometric (MUNANA) and chemiluminescent (NA-star) type of phenotypic assays are available. Both assays have the same limitations, such as the necessity of a virus propagation step, and may therefore not reliably detect resistant subpopulations and do not detect HA-mediated NA inhibitor resistance [104]. To standardize interpretation and reporting of NA inhibitor susceptibility of influenza viruses, clear definitions were formulated in 2012 using 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC50; the concentration of drug required to inhibit a standardized amount of NA activity by 50 %) fold-change thresholds, compared to the median for viruses from the same type/subtype/lineage showing \u201cnormal inhibition\u201d [105, 106].",

For oseltamivir, His274Tyr (based on N2 numbering) confers resistance in N1 [113], whereas Arg292Lys and Glu119Val are the most common antiviral resistance mutations in N2-containing viruses (Table 71.4). Because of the differences in interaction among drugs with the active enzyme site, varying patterns of cross-resistance are found for particular NA mutations. Importantly, zanamivir and laninamivir retain full inhibitory activity against variants with either the His274Tyr or Glu119Val mutation and partial activity against the Arg292Lys variant [114]. Viruses with a His274Tyr are also cross-resistant to peramivir. Antiviral resistance may be caused by a single resistance mutation or a combination of additional mutations, which may enhance the level resistance and/or causes multidrug resistance [115\u2013117].\n",

            "text": "In natural infections, oseltamivir-resistant variants have been detected much more commonly in treated children than adults (Table 71.6). In the past, analysis of samples from over 2500 influenza patients treated with oseltamivir as outpatients indicated that the frequency of resistance detection is about 0.4 % in adults and about 4.5 % in children [146]. Similar observations were made more recently in the IRIS trial where 14 of 19 oseltamivir-treated outpatients with resistance development were children aged below 5. The higher level of replication with longer duration of virus shedding increases the chance of developing antiviral resistance as compared to adults. Two studies in Japanese children reported high frequencies of 16 and 18 % oseltamivir resistance emergence during oseltamivir therapy [8, 147]. The use of weight-based dosing for children in Japan, as contrasted with unit dosing in most countries, is associated with lower drug exposure in young children. This has been postulated to be a major factor in the higher frequency of resistance detected in these studies. Among 54 volunteers experimentally infected with an A/H1N1 virus, oseltamivir-resistant variants with His274Tyr mutation were detected in two subjects in association with apparent rebounds in viral replication [148]. This study found that oseltamivir-treated subjects were less likely than placebo to have late viral isolates showing reversion of the egg-adapted inoculum virus to a human receptor HA genotype. The His274Tyr finding suggests that HA mutations with reduced affinity for human receptors might have a replication advantage over viruses with human receptor preference during oseltamivir use in humans. Interestingly, amino acid changes in the HA of the influenza A/H1N1 viruses prior to the emergence of the oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 virus in the 2007\u20132008 season have been predicted to have facilitated the emergence of the His274Tyr amino acid change [149, 150].\n",

Since immunocompromised patients are more likely to acquire influenza [155], showing relatively high influenza-associated mortality [10, 11, 153], effective antiviral is crucial for these patients. Like with influenza and young children, the higher level of replication with longer duration of virus shedding in immunocompromised patients increases the chance of developing antiviral resistance [156]. Several recent clinical studies have reported that the emergence of antiviral resistance among treated immunocompromised patients is not uncommon [151, 157, 158]. Recently, a prospective clinical study aimed to study antiviral resistance in immunocompromised patients (n = 24); a resistance prevalence of 17 % (4/24) was reported [158]. In all four cases the NA His275Tyr was detected by RT-PCR of 2009 influenza A/H1N1 virus-infected patients. In other retrospective studies, similar rates have been reported [151, 157]. The NA His275Tyr amino acid change has been described frequently during the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 virus pandemic in case reports of antiviral-treated immunocompromised patients [117, 159]. Amino acid changes at position 223 have also been reported to cause increased levels of resistance (48-fold) to oseltamivir. The impact on therapy is unclear for such moderate increase in oseltamivir resistance; however viruses with the combination of Ile223Arg and His275Tyr are highly resistant to oseltamivir in vitro (1750-fold) [160]. In the past, emergence of resistance in immunocompromised patients has been also described for influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B virus-infected patients treated with oseltamivir and zanamivir with mutations in both the viral HA and NA glycoproteins [8, 10, 12, 161]. Most fatal cases during influenza pandemics and seasonal epidemics are patients belonging to the traditional high-risk groups for developing severe disease, including the very young children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients [162]. Given the high mortality and morbidity, the moderate effectiveness of current antivirals, and the relatively high prevalence of resistance in immunocompromised patient, better treatment strategies are clearly needed for these patients.",

            "text": "Before the 2007\u20132008 influenza season, it was thought that NA inhibitor resistance development was to go hand in hand with reduction of virus fitness [97, 163]. Mathematical modeling predicted a 10 % relative transmissibility of oseltamivir-resistant variants would result in low levels of resistant viruses circulating in the community [164]. Based on animal experiments, the reduced fitness and replication competence of certain NA resistance mutations appeared to be depending on virus subtype and resistance mutation. For instance, an oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H3N2 virus with an Arg292Lysine amino acid change did not transmit between infected and na\u00efve ferrets and showed a 10\u2013100-fold reduction in nasal virus titers [165]. For the Glu119Val oseltamivir-resistant mutant, however, it was found that the mutant was as transmissible as wild type with comparable nasal virus titers in both donor and recipient animals [98]. An influenza A/H1N1 virus with a His275YTyr mutation required 100-fold higher inoculum to infect the donor ferret, but once infected, they transmitted the virus to contact animals with a delay of 1\u20133 days compared to wild-type virus. Early after the outbreak of the 2009 pandemic, it was questioned whether a His275Tyr oseltamivir-resistant mutant would be attenuated [13, 166, 167]. In vitro replication and in vivo pathogenicity studies were performed using resistant isolates; however, the answers were conflicting. Some researchers found slight attenuation of the early His275Tyr mutant A/H1N1 viruses [166], while others did not find such differences [167]. At most, from these conflicting data, it can be concluded that the differences between a wild-type 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 virus and its His275Tyr-resistant counterpart are too close to call by means of its pathogenicity and transmissibility [74]. Additional compensatory mutations may facilitate the emergence of NA inhibitor resistance mutations, which cause an initial loss of virus fitness [96]. For instance, for the His275Tyr amino acid change in 2007\u20132009 A/H1N1 viruses, several permissive amino acid changes have been suggested to have facilitated the emergence of this oseltamivir resistance change. The Asp344Asn amino acid change, which appeared before the 2007\u20132008 season, had increased the enzymatic properties of NA prior to the introduction of the His275Tyr amino acid change [113, 168]. Amino acid changes Val234Met and Arg222Gln maintained high NA expression in vitro, which was reduced if the single His275Tyr was expressed [80, 169]. In A/H3N2, compensatory roles for amino acid changes at position 222 have been assigned to compensate for the loss of fitness due to the Glu119Val oseltamivir resistance mutation [170, 171]. The observed community clusters of 2009 A/H1N1 viruses with a His275Tyr amino acid change do not seem to be attenuated by the His275Tyr amino acid change either [122]. These viruses contain, in addition to the His275Tyr change, changes at amino acid positions 241, 369, and 386. These mutations may also have permissive effects [122].",

Depending on the virus and assay, zanamivir is partially inhibitory for resistant variants with Arg292Lys substitution in N2, in that the loss of susceptibility is about 5\u201325-fold compared to the wild type [102, 172\u2013174]. There is controversy about the role of peramivir in the management of variants that are resistant to oseltamivir as in vitro and in vivo models have given conflicting results [175\u2013177].

Ribavirin combined with a NA inhibitor exerts additive to synergistic antiviral activity in vitro [188]. In mice experimentally infected with influenza A, the combination of orally administered ribavirin and peramivir was associated with improved survival relative to ribavirin alone but not to peramivir alone [189]. A more recent study found that a combination of ribavirin and oseltamivir was no more effective than ribavirin alone against a lethal influenza A(H1N1) infection but superior to single agents against influenza B [189]. Further studies of such ribavirin-NA inhibitor or T-705-NA inhibitor combinations (see below) are warranted to determine whether this strategy offers the possibility of treating severe influenza, particularly that due to M2 inhibitor-resistant viruses. Recently, triple combinations of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir have been studied in vitro, in vivo, and in humans with influenza infection [65, 66, 190]. Given the promise of this combination, a prospective phase 2 study is ongoing to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of this combination for the treatment of influenza. Combination therapy has been demonstrated to reduce the development of resistance in clinical studies and therefore may be of benefit in populations at increased risk of development of resistance emergences [54].",

It is highly active against seasonal strains A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza B; the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 virus; highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/H5N1 isolated from humans; A/H1N1 and A/H1N2 isolated from swine; and A/H2N2, A/H4N2, and A/H7N2. The antiviral is active against viruses that are resistant to amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir, and zanamivir, in addition to dually resistant viruses (M2 and NA inhibitor resistant) [191, 192]. In studies of serial passage of two seasonal (A/Brisbane/59/2007 and A/New Jersey/15/2007) and two 2009 pandemic (A/Denmark/524/2009 and A/Denmark/528/2009) A/H1N1 viruses in MDCK cell lines in the presence or absence of low concentrations of favipiravir, no favipiravir-resistant viruses were phenotypically or genotypically (PB1, PB2, PA, and NP sequencing) detected. Sequence analysis, though, did demonstrate an enrichment of G \u2192 A and C \u2192 T transversion mutations, increased mutation frequency, and a shift of the nucleotide profiles of individual NP gene clones under drug selection pressure [193]. Few clinical studies have been published with this novel compound, so the frequency of resistance emergence is not fully understood at this point. The drug is currently licensed in Japan for use selectively when approved by the Ministry of Health; studies of efficacy are ongoing in the rest of the world with the goal of seeking regulatory approval in the near future.",

These antibodies differ in their recognition sites: Some are targeted to the sialic acid RBS and globular head, while others bind to the stalk region [195]. As the stalk region is more conserved between different HA subtypes, cross-reactive immunity against several influenza subtypes may be obtained with broadly neutralizing capacities. Although the antibodies are being developed against conserved regions of HA, mutations do arise at the antibody target sites, which may result in viral escape.",

Further, resistance in seasonal A/H1N1 became widespread during the 2008\u20132009 influenza season. Lastly, NA inhibitor resistance has been demonstrated to emerge during therapy in highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that infect humans, with the highest frequency in A/H7N9 viruses [35, 36, 49].

With contemporary next-generation sequencing, it is possible to understand the kinetics of the emergence of resistance from minor variant populations to the predominant population in a given host. Such data can inform the optimal timing of screening and intervention. Specific risk factors beyond generic concepts, such as immunocompromised and young age, should be identified that predict the emergence of resistance. From a therapeutic perspective, the optimal approach, including the duration of therapy and the benefit of combination therapy in patients with severe illness or who are predicted to have prolonged shedding, needs to be carefully studied. Currently, there is a significant gap in the capacity to test specimens for resistance, and as a result, many patients with potential resistance may be missed. As a result, there is a desperate need for susceptibility assays that can be utilized broadly in the clinical laboratory.
