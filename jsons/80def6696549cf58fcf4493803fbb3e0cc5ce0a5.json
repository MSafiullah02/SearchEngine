This study uses real-world location-based service data collected from anonymized mobile devices to uncover mobility changes during COVID-19 and under the \"Stay-at-home\" state orders in the U.S. The study measures human mobility with two important metrics: daily average number of trips per person and daily average person-miles traveled. The data-driven analysis and modeling attributes less than 5% of the reduction in number of trips and person-miles traveled to the effect of policy. The models developed in the study exhibit high prediction accuracy and can be applied to inform epidemics modeling with empirically verified mobility trends and to support time-sensitive decision-making processes.",

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. emerged in Washington State on January 21st, 2020. Three months later, over three quarters of a million cases had been confirmed throughout the nation. Governments around the world are taking rapid action to mitigate the spread of the disease. The U.S. government proclaimed a national state of emergency on March 13th, 2020. Following an exponential growth in the number of confirmed cases, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced its first major disaster in the state of New York on March 20th, 2020, followed by California and Washington on March 22nd (FEMA, 2020). As of April 11th, 2020, FEMA had announced the COVID-19 pandemic a disaster in every state, with Wyoming being the last one. On March 19th, 2020, California became the first state to institute a \"Stay-at-home\" or \"Shelter in place\" order (State of California, 2020). By mid-April 2020, all but 8 states had followed suit. Three of the 8 states had partial stay-at-home orders, implemented by city mayors or county executives (Mervosh et al., 2020) .",

People did not reduce their travels until the second week of March, during which the World Health Organization (WHO) defined COVID-19 as a global pandemic and the proclamation on declaring a national emergency was made by the White House (WHO, 2020; White House, 2020). Immediately following, the sharpest deterioration of mobility was observed in the third week of March. Mobility in terms of daily average person-miles traveled has already dropped over 20% compared to January average when the first state in the U.S., California, announced a \"Stay-at-home\" order. In addition, the decrease of daily average number of trips per person has not dropped as significantly, indicating that more short-distance trips were made. Those could be out-door activities, grocery, pharmacy, and fast food, as confirmed in other parallel analyses (Google, 2020; PlaceIQ, 2020).",

            "text": "The big-data analytics suggest that, at the national level, people were already practicing social distancing by the time \"Stay-at-home\" orders were issued by state governors. How effective are those orders in further limiting people's travel? By April 10th, only 8 states had not issued \"Stayat-home\" orders. We reorganized the mobility data and anchored the data to the dates when different states announced their \"Stay-at-home\" orders, and then quantified the human mobility changes, compared to the January benchmark, three weeks, two weeks, and one week before and after the orders were issued (illustrated in Figure 2 ). While the data confirmed that, nationwide, mobility had dropped significantly one week or even two weeks before the orders were issued, an additional 6.1% decrease in daily average number of trips per person and 10.8% decrease in daily average person-miles traveled (PMT) were observed in the week after the order took effect across different states. The states that saw the most significant mobility drop after the orders are NJ (-17% trip, -23% PMT), NY (-17% trip, -22% PMT), IL (-16% trip, -23% PMT), CA (-16% trip, -22% PMT), MI (-14% trip, -23% PMT). The least significant mobility drops (+-5%) can be observed in PA, KY, MO, TN, and D.C. \"Stay-at-home\" orders vary widely in when and how they are implemented and enforced. Essential activities, such as receiving healthcare services, going grocery shopping, exercising and essential work are authorized during stay-at-home orders. Differences in the orders emerge in religious gatherings, where some states allow for gatherings of more than 10 people for special events while most do not. Interstate travel is sometimes allowed, although some states, such as Alaska, require special permission to leave the state and others, like Nevada, require a 14-day quarantine period for anyone re-entering the state (State of Alaska, 2020; Fox 11, 2020). Education institutions have been ordered closed in nearly half the U.S. states for the remainder of the year. Only seven states have recommended that schools be closed as opposed to ordering closure altogether (Education Week, 2020). Seeing family members outside of their immediate household is also not permitted in several states, unless for the purpose of \"caring for the family member,\" i.e. providing groceries for or medical aid to elderly or immunocompromised family members. Additionally, not all \"Stay-athome\" orders are implemented at the state level. Many were deployed in counties or cities before the entire state adopted the order. As of mid-April, three states: Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming had partial stay-at-home orders. Enforcement is a crucial component of \"Stay-at-home\" orders. Fifteen states (including D.C.) have stated that they would issue fines and possible jail time for persons violating the order; fourteen have stated that they would enforce the order by first issuing a warning, then possibly issuing a fine for a repeated offense; and fourteen more either have not stated how the order would be enforced or have explicitly stated that it would only be enforced through education, without penalties (Mazziotta, 2020) . This variation in how the order is enforced conveys a possible discrepancy in how people respond to the order. Risking a fine of $1000 or above and possible jail time in New Jersey, Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and several other states may deter residents from going out unnecessarily more so than states who solely focus on educating people who violate the order.",

A notable advantage of GAM lies in its flexibility that combines the linear and fixed effects with nonlinear effects such as temporal patterns, variable interaction, and individual-specific random effects. These are essential in longitudinal analysis since observations are intra-subject correlated, time-varying, and with unobserved heterogeneity. The control variables include the COVID-19 related features (daily number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases in the state and that number in the adjacent states), policy-related features (whether the order has been issued, and the levels of enforcements), and other factors contributing to the variation (i.e., random effect of time and states, weekday-weekend variation, and state governor approval rates).",

Nationally speaking, the orders lead to a daily reduction of 0.136 trips per person (or 4.9% of average daily number of trips per person) and a daily reduction of 1.185 person-miles traveled (or 4.8% of average daily person-miles traveled). State-level effect has also been quantified. Stay-at-home orders account for a greater effect in states with more strict enforcement, such as HI (the order leads to 0.21 person trips reduced and 3.55 miles reduced) and MI. Compared to states that issued Stay-at-home orders without penalty or without specifying particular enforcement, those enforced with warning and possible fines for repeated offense see an additional 0.4% in trip reduction. Enforcement with fines and possible jail time will further reduce 1.5% daily trips per person. The policy effect is greatly related to the timing of the orders. States that had an already deteriorated mobility before the order release or simply issued the order late saw a limited effect, such as NY and NJ.",

Here, anonymized and privacyenhanced location-based service data in the nation provides ground-truth empirical evidence on how people in the U.S. moved during the COVID-19 outbreak and successfully supported human mobility analytics and modeling. The models were deemed statistically significant and accurate, and estimated the effect of state-issued \"Stay-at-home\" orders and other influential factors on human mobility changes. Dynamics in human mobility, such as distance traveled and number of trips made in a day, were thus quantified. These model outputs can be immediately integrated in epidemics models that need empirical data support on human movement to assess transmission of disease and control measures. Our immediate next step is to determine hotspot travel destinations in decision support of mitigating spread and reducing local transmissions.
