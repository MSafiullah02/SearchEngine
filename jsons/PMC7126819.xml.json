However, experimental requirements of these methodologies often restrict their throughput and suitability for studying conformationally heterogeneous RNAs. In addition, the isolation of RNA motifs from full-length transcript, or the removal of RNAs from their cellular context, may introduce biases in the final conformation. The development of RNA-centric deep-sequencing probing techniques opened up the possibility for the global assessment of RNA structures at a single nucleotide resolution, and in various biological contexts.11, 12, 13 In addition, techniques that address RNA interactions with effector molecules14, 15, 16, 17, 18 prompted the comprehension that a myriad of molecular pathways involve regulatory RNAs while also facilitating the development of high affinity ligands to interfere with these processes. These innovations created a new paradigm in the field of biomedicine, where RNA is viewed as a novel and largely unexplored drug target.",

            "text": "At the same time, the highly dynamic conformation and repetitive character of its surface presents difficulties for drug design.25, 26 In addition, many putative small molecule-binding pockets in RNA are much more polar and solvent exposed than binding sites on proteins, complicating ligand design efforts. Compounding these issues, most target RNAs are expressed at low levels, with the exception of ribosomal (rRNA) and transfer (tRNA) RNAs, which constitute 80\u201390% and 10\u201315% of total cellular RNA, respectively.27 Other abundant RNAs, such as messenger (mRNA), small nuclear (snRNA), and small nucleolar (snoRNA) are present at levels that are about 1\u20132 orders of magnitude lower than rRNA and tRNA. Certain small RNAs, such as micro (miRNA) and piwi (piRNAs) can be present at very high levels; however, this appears to be cell type dependent. One should keep in mind that if the RNA has catalytic activity or if it acts as a scaffold to regulate chromosomal architecture, as it is the case for many long non-coding (lncRNAs), the RNA may not need to be present at very high levels to be able to perform its task. RNA stability is another detrimental aspect that needs to be considered. For example, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have, on average, shorter half-life (median 3.5 h) than messenger RNAs (mRNAs, median 3.5 h).28 Yet, the intergenic, cis-antisense, as well as spliced lncRNAs with cytoplasmic localization tend to challenge that rule.",

Early RNA targeting approaches relied on the application of aminoglycosides - potent molecules that bind to bacterial rRNA through electrostatic interactions with, at best, modest selectivity and systemic toxicity.29, 30 Despite their rather unattractive physical, chemical, pharmacological and synthetic characteristics, they remain a pillar of antibacterial treatment. Studies of RNA riboswitch regulatory elements that bind diverse metabolites and regulate gene expression primarily in bacteria further showed that small metabolites can be recognized by RNA with remarkable specificity.31, 32 These discoveries were followed by the development of small molecule screens against functionally defined viral RNA motifs, such as Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transactivating response element (TAR) RNA and its interacting trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein,33 HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) and Rev protein,34 and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES).10, 35 These studies established that RNA is a legitimate target of small molecules and that ligands can indeed bind discrete binding pockets in RNA, cementing the applicability of small-molecule treatment to target RNAs.",

Overall, three major components are required to support the development of efficacious RNA-based small molecule therapeutics: (1) the identification of therapeutically valuable RNA target, (2) the development of a screening method that will establish drug-like molecules against target RNA, and (3) the identification of RNA motifs that accommodate ligand binding with high affinity and specificity. In this review, we will discuss the modern RNA-centric techniques that can be harnessed to elucidate RNA structure-to-function relationship and their potential application to evaluate small molecule specificity. We will shed light on RNA properties e.g. stability, level of expression, structure and biological importance that need to be considered before a given transcript can be designated as druggable. Finally, we will present most recent developments in screening strategies that support identification of RNA-specific ligands, and we will highlight the newest discoveries in the field of therapeutically-valuable target RNAs.",

It is highly reactive with solvent accessible, unpaired residues but reliably unreactive with bases engaged in Watson-Crick interactions, thus nucleotides that are strongly protected or reactive to DMS can be inferred to be base-paired or unpaired, respectively. DMS treatment has been more recently coupled to a massively parallel sequencing readout (DMS-seq) by randomly fragmenting the pool of modified RNAs and size-selecting prior to 3\u2032 ligation with a specific adapter oligo.41 Because DMS modifications at adenine and cytosine residues block reverse transcription (RT), sequencing of the fragments reveals the precise site of DMS modification, with the number of reads at each position providing a measure of relative reactivity of that site. DMS footprinting has proven to be a tremendously versatile method and has been applied to a large fraction of known structured RNAs42 as well as to probe the structure of modified RNAs and ligand binding to RNA.43\n",

From the partition function of base pairing, a SHAPE-MaP data-informed Shannon entropy52 can be calculated, which yields information on the diversity of RNA conformation within a given region (Fig. 1\nA). In general, regions that have both low SHAPE reactivities and low Shannon entropy are likely to exist in a single structural state. These have been found to be highly correlated with known functional RNA structures,52, 53 and as such they potentially represent valuable drug targets. In addition, SHAPE-MaP allows researchers to study the effects of small molecule binding on native RNA structure. The \u0394SHAPE-MaP comparative analysis can yield information on not only whether a small molecule binds, but also which specific nucleotides constitute potential binding sites(s). The effectiveness of this approach has been proven on HIV-1 TAR and thienopyridine, a novel TAR-specific ligand.54 Here, however, the prior version of RNA probing method, namely SHAPE, was performed on in vitro transcribed HIV-1 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) to validate the ligand specificity.",

Proximity ligation of duplex RNA fragments, photo-reversal of crosslinks, and high throughput sequencing ultimately reveal the direct base pairing between fragments. Each PARIS read gives individual-molecule evidence of a duplex between two RNA fragments. The multiplicity of PARIS reads can thus reveal a single common structure, multiple alternative structures, or interactions between two RNAs in trans.

This technique provides a principled approach for integrating thermodynamic prediction with mapping data. On the other hand, Swellix combines all possible helices with a combinatorial approach to the RNA folding problem in order to compute all possible non-pseudoknotted RNA structures. The software can include experimental constraints on global RNA structures, such as data from pairing constraints in phylogenetic analysis, SELEX experiments, or chemical and enzymatic probing experiments, as well as thermodynamic parameters. Both bioinformatic methods represent complementary tools to analyze RNA sequences with multiple folds. Overall, the abovementioned methodologies led to much-improved appreciation of the ubiquity and functional capabilities of RNA structures.

RAP-RNA can be performed using various crosslinking reagents to differentiate between target RNA direct and indirect contacts with other transcripts. For instance, direct RNA-RNA interactions are specifically captured by UV and AMT crosslinking, while indirect interactions, involving protein intermediates, can be captured by crosslinking with formaldehyde. Compared to other similar techniques, the most distinctive feature of RAP is the use of long capture probes that tile across the target RNA, allowing for stringent hybridization and wash conditions that significantly reduce nonspecific background.",

The main difference between these techniques is that probes for ChIRP tile the entire target RNA, while probes for dChIRP are used as specific pools to characterize RNA at the domain level, and probes for CHART are experimentally determined after an RNase H assay, which defines the accessible hybridization regions. ChiRP has been applied to reveal the genomic occupancy of two therapeutically valuable lncRNAs, namely telomerase RNA (TERC) and HOX-transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR). HOTAIR has been shown to function as a key regulator of chromatin states and dynamics by recruiting and affecting PRC2 occupancy on genes genome-wide. It has been associated with tumorigenesis, growth, invasion, cancer, stem cell differentiation, metastasis, and drug resistance, and as such it is considered as a biomarker for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in several cancers.71, 72 TERC is a critical RNA component of telomerase polymerase that serves as a template for the enzyme telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) to elongate telomeres. Variants and copy-number changes at the TERC locus have been associated with cancer risk and progression73 and neurodegenerative diseases.74 Given the ability of small molecules to detect RNA structural elements and target specific biomolecular interactions, these tools are perfectly poised to expand the palette of achievable drug targets.",

For example, m6A destabilizes pairing with uracil by altering the energetics of the AU pair through steric hindrance, but without affecting the pattern of hydrogen-bonding donors and acceptors.83 The presence of m6A reduces RNA base pair stability both in vitro and in vivo,84 creating binding sites for proteins that preferentially recognize modified bases (Fig. 1C).83 Distinct human diseases, including developmental disorders,85 cancer and viral infections86 have been associated with dysregulation of m6A patterns in various cellular transcripts. Also, two m6A sites have been detected in the stem loop II of HIV-1 RRE,87 a viral RNA motif that has been the focus of many current and past targeting efforts,34 forcing scientists to rethink their strategies for effective drug-design. The regulatory functions of m5C are not yet fully understood.88 It has been shown, however, that in vitro cytosine-5 methylation can affect Mg2+ binding to tRNA molecules, which influences the anticodon stem loop conformation and stability of the secondary structure.89 Also, synthetic cytosine-5 methylated mRNAs exhibit increased stability, and the loss of methylation in the 3\u2032 UTR of p16, an mRNA encoding tumor suppressor, has been reported to reduce its stability.88 Thus, it is likely that m5C affects RNA stability and function in living cells.76 The m1A modification carries a positive charge that protrudes from the Watson\u2013Crick hydrogen-bonding face of adenine, resulting in the nucleotide remaining unpaired, and thus can dramatically alter protein-RNA interactions and RNA secondary structures through electrostatic effects. The m1A maps uniquely to positions near the translation start site and first splice site in coding transcripts, and it correlates with upregulation of translation.77 Isomerization of uridine, known as pseudouridine (\u03a8),90 affects RNA secondary structure by increasing backbone rigidity and base stacking, due to a preference of the 3\u2032-end conformation.91 The precise pseudouridylation pattern and their role in human RNAs remains only partially uncovered. However, based on the heat shock induced \u03a8 deposition in yeast mRNAs, it is assumed that \u03a8 increases mRNA stability by preventing the melting of RNA structures that protect the 3-end at increased temperatures.92\n",

Yet, we might be just at the verge of resolving that issue. For example, Costales et al.111 have recently identified a small molecule that binds two targets, the precursor hairpins of miR-515 and miR-885, which share a common target motif. In this new study, the group optimized the dual-selective molecule to bind only one of the targets. By using secondary structures of the two binding sites, the model identified an additional, adjacent binding site only present on miR-515, and used fragment-based assembly to create a molecule with over 3200-fold selectivity over the parent compound for the new site. The new molecule, Targaprimir-515, only bound miR-515 containing the original target site and the adjacent site. MiR-515 represses sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a key enzyme that phosphorylates sphingosine \u2013 and its downstream target S1P, thereby blocking a pathway that promotes cell proliferation and migration in human breast cancer.",

            "text": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a severe neurodegenerative disease caused by a loss or dysfunction of survival motor neuron (SMN1) genes and is the leading cause of genetic-related infant death (Fig. 3\nA).125 The loss of SMN1 results in the degradation of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and causes symptoms such as hypotonia and severe weakness due to neuromuscular degradation. Interestingly, the sequence of the survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene differs from SMN1 by a single nucleotide. This single nucleotide change increases the rate of exon 7 exclusion during splicing events, thus SMN2 can produce little to no functional SMN protein. Increasing exon 7 inclusion in SMN2 mRNA with a small molecule could be therapeutically beneficial. PTC Therapeutics discovered a molecule, RG7800, which increased the production of the inefficiently spliced SMN2 in a FRET-based assay (Fig. 2B).126 RG7800 was the first small molecule splicing modifier to enter clinical trials. The drug is being tested in Phase 1b/2a trials in SMA patients, although it is currently on hold due to safety findings.115 Novartis (Basel, Switzerland) also identified a small molecule, LMI070,122 which works via stabilization of the transient double-strand RNA structure formed by the SMN2 pre-mRNA and a small nuclear ribonucleic protein U1.125 LMI070 binding causes more efficient splicing of the SMN2 gene and therefore increases levels of functional SMN proteins. The ongoing first-in-human study (NCT02268552) is evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential benefit of LMI070 in type 1 SMA patients between 1 and 7 months of age. These discoveries demonstrate the feasibility of small molecule-mediated RNA-selective splice modulation, as well as the potential for leveraging this strategy in other splicing diseases such as cancer.127\n",

The well-studied RNA repeat expansion is the trinucleotide repeat that causes DM1, r(CUG)exp, which binds and sequesters the RBP splicing regulator muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1), among others.130 In 2009, Warf et al. identified a small molecule, pentamidine, which disrupted the MBNL1-CUG repeat complex in DM1.131 When pentamidine disrupts the CUG RNA foci, it releases the MBNL1 protein from sequestration and reverses aberrant alternative splicing that is commonly seen in DM1 mis-spliced pre-mRNAs. Originally, pentamidine was believed to bind to the r(CUG)exp. However, when Coonrod et al. attempted to identify the exact mechanism, biophysical experiments failed to demonstrate significant affinity between pentamidine and CUG RNA repeat.132 Through a series of experiments, scientists suggested that pentamidine may interact with the CTG*CAG repeat DNA to inhibit transcription; however, the mechanism of action for this small molecule is still unknown. Using a structure of r(CUG) repeats, the Zimmerman laboratory designed a small molecule comprised of an acridine and a triaminotriazine that interacts with the RNA via Janus-wedge hydrogen bonding.133 Optimization of the first-generation compound resulted in three bioactive compounds that improved mis-splicing and formation of nuclear foci in both DM1 cellular and Drosophila models.134 Furthermore, the Disney group has also been very active in identifying inhibitors of different RNA repeats including transcripts involved in both DM1 and DM2, FXTAS, and, most recently, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).135 They reported a substituted naphthyridine that was identified by high-throughput screening and shown to inhibit the r(CUG)exp-MBNL1 interaction using a FRET-based assay.136 In cell models, the chemotype improved DM1-associated pre-mRNA splicing defects and caused reductions in nuclear foci formation. Subsequently, the compound has also been identified as an inhibitor of miR-544.137 Finally, the Disney laboratory also identified benzimidazoles by screening of an RNA-focused small-molecule library, as well as oligomeric Hoechst dye-like compounds that bind r(CUG)exp in cells and have promising effects on DM1-associated defects in cell models.138\n",

Further stabilization of each G4-RNA is then achieved through the presence of a monovalent cation, most often potassium, which is localized in the center between each pair of tetrads.141 G-quadruplexes has been first described in DNA,142 yet there are key structural differences between DNA and RNA G4s that may further the therapeutic targeting of G4-RNA. In general, RNA G4s have higher stability attributed to differences in hydration and increased intramolecular hydrogen bonding due to 2\u2032 of ribose sugar.143 Another key difference between DNA and RNA is the presence of a methyl group in uracil which is absent in its counterpart thymine present in DNA. Substitution of 2\u2032 \u2014OH by chemical analogues also has shown to destabilize G-quadruplexes further highlighting its importance in G-quadruplex structure.144 Utilizing these differences between RNA and DNA can increase the selectivity and specificity of available G-quadruplex ligands towards RNA.145 Recent publication by Kwok et al. provided a comprehensive overview of predictive algorithms and structure-based sequencing methods that can be utilized for transcriptome-wide detection of G4-RNA.146\n",

This technique provides insight into the G4-RNA landscape in the human transcriptome, as well as a means for studying the dynamics of in vivo dynamic formation of G4-RNA under various biological conditions, in addition to the activity of G4-RNA-specific ligands.",

These include TAR154 and RRE,155 but also the dimer initiation sequence (DIS),156 the packaging signal (\u03a8),157 and the Gag/Pol frameshifting signal.34 The TAR element resides within the 5\u2032 UTR of the viral genome and serves as the binding site for the Tat protein. Formation of the TAR/Tat complex stimulates transcription elongation to yield full-length viral transcripts.33 A fragment-based screening approach to identify ligands of the HIV TAR has been described by G\u00f6bel and colleagues, who interrogated a set of 29 small molecules that were selected to represent molecular motifs beneficial for RNA recognition.118 Also, Benhida and coworkers pursued a design approach for TAR RNA\u2010binding ligands based on amino-phenylthiazole derivatives.54, 158 More recently, Schneekloth and colleagues have applied small molecule microarray (SMM) screening of a fluorescently labeled TAR hairpin to identify selective chemotypes (Fig. 2D).54 Other frequently targeted HIV motif include RRE, which is located in the second intron of the viral genomic RNA and serves as a high\u2010affinity binding site for the Rev protein. Rev binding to RRE is required for the nucleocytoplasmic export of full\u2010length and singly spliced viral transcripts.87 Only two studies report small molecules targeting the Rev-RRE complex.35 None of these approaches have produced inhibitors that show antiviral activity in cells. A recent study has shown that RRE carries m6A modifications that play a critical role in the activity of the RRE/Rev complex,34 which serves as a poignant reminder that authentic model systems are necessary for the study of RNA targets.",

Most conventional fluorescence assays rely on incorporation of fluorescent probes in the RNA sequence, which might impact its native conformation as a side effect.172 An alternative to that approach is the fluorescent indicator displacement assay (FID), where the indicator displays different fluorescence properties in the presence and absence of the oligonucleotide, and can therefore be utilized to measure the binding properties of various chemotypes.173, 174 FID is a tagless approach, meaning that the target RNA and the ligands under investigation do not have to be modified. Instead, the FID assay utilizes intercalating dyes, e.g. 3-methyl-2-((1-(3-(trimethylammonio)propyl)-4-quinolinylidene)methyl)benzothiazolium (TO-PRO)175 thiazole orange,176 which show high binding affinities to RNA but frequently require large quantities of RNA. Recent alternation to the method relies on the use of high affinity RNA-specific peptides, e.g., HIV Tat labeled with a Forster Resonance Enhancement Transfer (FRET) pair, against specific RNA-motif, e.g. TAR (Fig. 4\nA).33, 119 When the peptide is bound to RNA, the fluorophores are distant in space, which facilitates the excitation of the donor and emission detection from the acceptor. When the small molecule probe displaces the peptide from the RNA, the fluorophores are proximal, and the emission of the acceptor is quenched. This quenching allows for quantification of the binding affinity of the small molecule towards TAR RNA. Recently, the Hargrove laboratory extended the development of fluorescent peptide displacement assay for screening small molecule ligands against four different RNA targets, namely Tat to HIV-1-TAR and HIV-2-TAR, bacterial ribosomal A-site RNA and the IIB domain HIV-1-Rev response element RNA (RRE-IIB).177 The authors validated the method by quantifying the binding of aminoglycosides and other known RNA binding small molecules, against all four RNA targets.",

This chemical array is probed for binding against a library of labeled RNA motifs, along with competitor oligonucleotides. After incubation, it is analyzed for RNA motif-ligand interactions and the hit RNA motifs are excised from the array, quantified, and sequenced. Following sequencing, the RNA binding-small molecule interaction is analyzed by structure-activity relationships through sequencing (StARTS) or high-throughput structure-activity relationships through sequencing (HiT-StARTS), which use statistical approaches to determine RNA motif fitness, affinity and selectivity for a specific small molecule.195, 196 StARTS can be utilized to identify positive and negative features of RNA motif targets that may impact small molecule affinity, and assign a score based upon the RNA motif-ligand interaction.195 HiT-StARTS defines RNA-small molecule affinity landscapes, scores the RNA-motif small molecule binding partners, and generates structure-activity relationships based on data collected from next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq), 2DCS, and experimentally determined affinities.196 StARTS and HiT-StARTS can be used in tandem with Inforna, a bioinformatics-based approach that integrates RNA motif\u2013small molecule interactions identified via 2DCS and structural data of target RNAs.186, 196, 197 Inforna generates lead compounds for an RNA of interest by comparing the motifs found in the RNA target\u2019s structure with the RNA motif\u2013small-molecule interactions in its database.",

They suggest that: (1) binding must occur in a functionally active region, e.g. Dicer or Drosha processing region, (2) the ligand must bind to that site with high affinity, and (3) both RNA abundance and molecule affinity can affect the target occupancy necessary to elicit a biological response.",

This result suggests that the ligands can select and have a strong preference for the parallel propeller-like conformation found in telomeric sequences.203 In the context of viral RNA, a FBDD approach has been used to identify ligands of the HIV TAR element.118 G\u00f6bel and colleagues interrogated a set of 29 small molecules that were selected to represent molecular motifs beneficial for RNA recognition. The fragments were rich in chemotypes that provide hydrogen bond donors and included amines, amidines, and guanidines, as well as benzene rings for stacking interactions. A fluorometric competition assay determined that seven small molecule compounds were able to displace a dye labeled Tat peptide from a TAR RNA. Also, Lee et al. reported a fragment-based screen for small molecules that bind to the influenza A virus promoter.204 Overall, the value of fragment-based approaches may not only be in developing leads for specific RNA structures, but also in helping to assess the druggability of newly discovered RNA structures. Compared to other chemotype screening methods, FBDD allows for the selection of a weak fragment to be highly specialized for the targeted RNA molecule based off not only the initial hits but also the targeted RNA\u2019s NMR spectroscopy or crystal structure, thus creating a highly potent, RNA-specific therapeutic. Furthermore, FBDD can assess whether RNA target is druggable through the amount, strength, and specificity of weak binder hits, e.g. if there are little to no hits for a specific RNA then it will most likely have structural elements that inhibit the binding of a small molecule.",

Aberrant interactions of RNA with proteins is a well-recognized factor that leads to the RNA gain-of-function mechanism that underlines repeat expansion disorders as discussed. Here, to achieve a therapeutic effect, an RNA-specific chemotype would need to specifically recognize and bind the disrupted RNA to prevent protein binding. Binding to the protein itself would inhibit its cellular function and likely cause adverse effects. Conversely, in the case of loss-of-function disorders that decrease protein binding, a therapeutic small molecule needs to enhance protein binding, as shown by small molecule ligands that bind to SMN2 pre-mRNA and alter its alternative splicing. The advances in methods that enable characterization of native RNAs structure, function, cellular localization and intermolecular interaction will further expand the already broad selection of potential therapeutic targets for small molecules. Utilizing the information gained by studying RNAs from various biological and in vitro systems will certainly accelerate the progress of RNA-specific drug design. However, RNAs derived from different biological systems may represent distinct challenges as drug targets, regardless of their biological or pharmacological significance. Here, the relative expression of target RNA in a cell, its localization and structural accessibility of functional sites for ligand binding, will certainly affect its druggability.",

            "text": "Another challenge will be overcoming the issues of specificity and selectivity, which are major barriers for RNA-binding molecules. For example, rRNA constitutes the vast majority of cellular RNA while ncRNA collectively constitutes less than 5% of total cellular RNA. Thus, targeting one ncRNA selectively might be challenging. However, the implementation of structure-bases and high-throughput screening methods that we have discussed are proven to be effective at identifying new small molecule chemotypes with both good specificity and high affinity. Also, the flexibility of RNA-specific small molecules should aid the construction of effective multifunctional drugs that have more than one mode of action and affect multiple targets that could replace drug cocktails. Lessons learned from efforts of ligand discovery for structured RNA elements, including regulatory motifs in the viruses, bacterial rRNA and other ncRNA may inspire the future search for inhibitors that target RNA motifs in a wide range of human disorders. In addition, novel tools emerge as we speak, ranging from nanopore sequencing for detecting RNA base modification (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/09/459529) to artificial intelligence-driven drug design.209 These will soon offer new insights to RNA biology and provide a significant step forward in the development of novel and much needed therapeutics.",

            "text": "Fig. 4: Examples of RNA-specific small molecule screening techniques. [A] Fluorescent peptide displacement assay. The fluorescently-labeled peptide bound to RNA has fluorophores distant in space facilitating excitation of donor and emission detection from acceptor. When the small molecule displaces the peptide from the RNA, the fluorophores are proximal, and the emission of acceptor is quenched allowing for quantification of ligand binding affinity. [B] Small molecule microarray screening approach (SMM). Fluorescently labeled target RNA motif is incubated with the array followed by the detection of fluorescence increase during binding event. Right side represents raw SMM images for hit structure (compounds are printed in duplicate), control and buffer. [C] Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is performed in thin capillaries (blue) in free solution. A microscopic temperature gradient is induced by an infrared laser (IR), and temperature related intensity change as well as thermophoresis are detected. Initially, the molecules are homogeneously distributed and a constant \u201cinitial fluorescence\u201d is detected. After activation of the IR laser, a rapid change in fluorophore properties due to the fast temperature change is noted. Subsequently, thermophoretic movement of the fluorescencently labeled molecules out of the heated sample volume can be detected. The overall MST signal is plotted against the ligand concentration to obtain a dose-response curve (on the right). [D] Two-dimensional combinatorial screen (2DCS) selects privileged RNA motifs for a specific ligand by simultaneously screening a nucleic acid library and a small molecule library. The chemicals are immobilized in a microarray format in a gradient of concentrations. Each row represents decreasing concentrations of a unique chemical/small molecule. The RNA library is then allowed to react and hybridize on the microarray, and the unbound RNA is washed away. The bound fractions are then excised, RNA is extracted and sequenced to identify features which allow binding to each small molecule. [E] Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) includes unbiased diverse fragment set tested against target RNA using different biophysical, e.g. NMR and/or biochemical, e.g. SHAPE screen approaches leading to hit identification that is further structure-led optimized.",
