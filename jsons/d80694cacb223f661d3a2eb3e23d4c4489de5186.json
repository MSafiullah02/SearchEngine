State and local public health officials use the information about occurrence of diseases to accurately monitor trends, plan and make decisions, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Established surveillance systems should be regularly reviewed based on the explicit criteria of usefulness, cost, and quality, and existing systems should be modified as a result of such reviews. Attributes of quality include: (1) sensitivity; (2) specificity; (3) representativeness; (4) timeliness; (5) simplicity; (6) flexibility; and (7) acceptability. The sensitivity of a surveillance system is its ability to detect health events (completeness of reporting). Its specificity is inversely proportional to the number of false-positive reports. Representativeness can be measured by comparing surveillance data covering part of the population to either nationwide data, where available, or to random samplesurvey data. Simplicity in a system means it is easy to understand and implement, and is usually expected to be relatively cheap and flexible. A flexible system can easily be adapted by adding new disease entities, conditions, and/or by extending surveillance to additional population groups. Acceptability depends on the perceived public health importance of the event under surveillance, recognition of individual contributions, and the time required for reports.",

The main responsibilities of NCDC include conducting surveillance on communicable and non-communicable diseases; controlling important diseases; carrying out preventive measurements; promoting healthy lifestyles; and gathering and processing medical statistical data. In addition, NCDC houses the Georgian National collection of especially dangerous pathogens. The NCDC network comprises 11 regional public health centers (CPH) and 66 district (rayon) CPH. Medical facilities and physicians are also part of the network.",

The healthcare system seemed nearly non-existent, and only international healthcare agencies were operating with the support of international organizations by conducting surveillance on communicable and non-communicable diseases. With the help of these agencies, NCDC succeeded in control and prevention of diseases important to the public health through health promotion programs, gathering and processing medical statistical data, running immunization programs, and so forth. During the 1990s, there were numerous achievements, like situation analysis and public health strategy design and piloting. Communicable disease surveillance guidelines for CPHs and healthcare providers, job aids for district-level CPHs and facility workers, etc., were established; human resource capacity was strengthened; district-level training and continuous supervision and support were carried out; and nationwide policy (endorsed by MoLHSA Decrees) was developed and implemented. Standard case definitions were determined for AFP/polio, measles, diphtheria, mumps, rubella/CRS, pertussis, tetanus, acute viral hepatitis, rabies, shigellosis, salmonellosis, cholera, bacterial meningitis, and influenza H5N1. Case definitions for anthrax, plague, tularemia, brucellosis, TBE, hemorrhagic fevers (HFRS, CCHF), and other diseases are forthcoming.",

About 60% of the staff members are specialists with university educations, and 32% of them are doctors of science or are candidates for scientific doctorates. The list of implemented and ongoing projects jointly funded by the United States and other international agencies demonstrates the diversity of their expertise: The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has begun implementation of a project aiming to improve the surveillance system through standardized and repeatable disease monitoring systems, mobile epidemiological response teams, and secure transportation of infectious agents; systems of communications and information technology, including electronic communicable disease reporting system; biosafety and physical security of central reference laboratories, safe transportation of pathogens, and to provide help in promulgating new national rules and regulations, and their relations to BWPPP. All these elements are supplied with verifiable training in their field. A central Epidemiological Monitoring Station (EMS) was arranged at NCDC. It is equipped with modern sophisticated equipment, like light cyclers, RT-PCR, and so forth. EMS carries out surveillance on especially dangerous infections. Here, the first avian flu case in Georgia was identified.",
