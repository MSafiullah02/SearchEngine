Because viruses spread from infected to uninfected cells,6 viral-specific target cells or organs are determinants of viral transmission routes. Receptor-mediated viral entry into a host cell is the first step of viral infection. Our immunofluorescent data showed that ACE2 protein, which has been proven to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia, supporting the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. ACE2 staining is rarely seen in esophageal mucosa, probably because the esophageal epithelium is mainly composed of squamous epithelial cells, which express less ACE2 than glandular epithelial cells.",

The continuous positive detection of viral RNA from feces suggests that the infectious virions are secreted from the virus-infected gastrointestinal cells. Recently, we and others have isolated infectious SARS-CoV-2 from stool (unpublished data), confirming the release of the infectious virions to the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, fecal-oral transmission could be an additional route for viral spread. Prevention of fecal-oral transmission should be taken into consideration to control the spread of the virus.",

According to the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for the disposition of patients with SARS-CoV-2, the decision to discontinue transmission-based precautions for hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 is based on negative results rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from at least 2 sequential respiratory tract specimens collected \u226524 hours apart.8 However, in more than 20% of patients with SARS-CoV-2, we observed that the test result for viral RNA remained positive in feces, even after test results for viral RNA in the respiratory tract converted to negative, indicating that the viral gastrointestinal infection and potential fecal-oral transmission can last even after viral clearance in the respiratory tract. Therefore, we strongly recommend that rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from feces should be performed routinely in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and that transmission-based precautions for hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 should continue if feces test results are positive by rRT-PCR testing.",
