There are many compounds that improve immune responses and reduce the risk of disease through different mechanisms of action.\u2022Probiotics are the supplementation of viable microorganisms that offer potential health benefits to the animal. Probiotics are predominately supplemented to improve gastrointestinal health, rumen fermentation, or nutrient utilization.\u2022Prebiotics are a group of indigestible carbohydrates that function to improve the growth of commensal bacteria. Some fractions (eg, \u03b2-glucans and mannanoligosaccharides) have direct immunomodulatory, gram-negative pathogen binding, or hydrophobic mycotoxin absorption capacities.\u2022Phytonutrients are a group of compounds isolated from plants with potential therapeutic applications given their intrinsic antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties.\u2022Polyunsaturated fatty acids influence the degree of inflammation. Generally, increasing the supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid sources decreases inflammation, whereas supplementation of omega-6 fatty acids increases inflammation. How much inflammation is needed at any specific physiologic stage is less understood in ruminant species.\n\n",

In this review, we discuss the general mechanisms of action of common nutraceutical classes that are currently available to be used in ruminants. We classify and discuss each nutraceutical as either a probiotic, prebiotic, phytonutrient (eg, polyphenol, spices/essential oils), or polyunsaturated fatty acid. Finally, nutraceuticals are a rapidly developing field and it is important to note that these compounds lack governmental regulatory oversight by the Food and Drug Administration given their classification as \u201cdietary supplements.\u201d Therefore, product label statements regarding composition, dosage, effectiveness, and quality are not necessarily independently validated or standardized.",

There is a shift in the microbial ecology in the GIT in early life. The neonatal GIT is colonized by many facultative anaerobic bacteria that are common in the environment, including a lot of the family of Enterobacteriaceae that include many strains of pathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. There is a shift to more strict anaerobic bacteria as the animal ages with reduced abundance of Enterobacteriaceae.\n68 Many of the probiotic microorganisms supplemented are either strict anaerobes or facultative anaerobes that commonly increase in abundance as an animal increases in age and are more often lactic acid-producing bacteria. Some of the logic is that speeding up this microbial progression will reduce GIT disease, especially by Enterobacteriaceae, because the GIT environment is less conducive to their colonization.",

There are specialized cells in the GIT epithelium known as M cells that constantly sample contents from the GIT and deliver antigens to the lymphocyte-rich Peyer\u2019s patches. Maintenance of the commensal microbial structure of the GIT helps regulate the inflammatory response in the small intestine to prevent an overreaction to the commensal microbiome and potentially other enteric pathogens.70 The presence of secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), antimicrobial peptides, and other regulatory leukocyte responses at the GIT mucosa is an important mechanism that regulates proinflammatory responses, which are essential to maintaining GIT integrity and function. Liang et al. (in press) supplemented Jersey bull calves with 2 strains of lactic acid-producing bacteria and challenged them at 7 days of age with a moderate dose of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. Calves supplemented with probiotic bacteria had reduced systemic inflammation and less mucosal damage as demonstrated by greater villi height:crypt depth in both the duodenum and ileum compared with the unsupplemented, challenged calves.8 Localized proinflammatory responses are considered beneficial in most tissues; however, in the GIT mucosa, an excessive proinflammatory response may compromise the integrity of the GIT barrier and further exacerbate the pathogenesis of the disease.",

However, supplementing probiotic species that either produce or stimulate the production of more butyrate have the potential to alter GIT mucosal defenses (see Fig. 1). Butyrate is one of the short-chain fatty acids produced by bacteria in the rumen and intestines. Butyrate is a preferred energy source for GIT epithelium that results in the proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells in the rumen and both the small and large intestines. Butyrate can affect barrier development of the small intestine by increasing tight junction protein expression and exhibiting immunomodulatory effects on enterocytes and mucosal surfaces of the GIT by increasing neutrophil migration.71, 72 Current research suggests that butyrate has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer functions along with promoting epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation.73 Supplementation of butyrate to dairy heifers increased average daily gain and GIT development.74, 75 Supplementing butyrate-producing bacteria as probiotics is a relatively novel concept. Furthermore, a process known as cross-feeding has been recently described in which butyrate-producing bacteria are stimulated to proliferate in the presence of lactic acid originating from lactic acid-producing bacteria. Therefore, some of the benefits observed from supplementing common probiotic strains currently used in ruminants may partially be explained by changes in butyrate production in the GIT.",

Supplementing feedlot cattle with lactic acid-producing bacteria decreased E coli O157:H7 and Salmonella sp. fecal shedding, as well as contamination on carcass hides postharvest.9, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 Supplementing probiotics to feedlot cattle as a preharvest food safety strategy is now a common industry practice. Most of the data currently available regarding probiotic supplementation in dairy cow rations have assessed its effect on performance and milk quality (eg, somatic cell count). Fecal pathogen shedding or manure consistency were not commonly reported variables in these studies. It is conceivable that many of the probiotic species discussed previously in neonates may have some lower GIT benefits in mature dairy cows. In fact, some of the performance benefits such as increased milk production may be partially attributable to improvements in GIT health. Furthermore, supplementing probiotics to mature dairy cows seems to have the greatest health and economic benefits during stressful events, most notably the transition period.",

The mucosal immune system is a complex network of mucosal surfaces spanning the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts. Immune responses generated at one mucosal location can transfer to other mucosal surfaces through trafficking and recirculation of effector and memory leukocytes; however, this likely does not include the mammary gland. The paucity of data and the lack of a clear mechanism of action do not support the notion that oral administration of probiotics improves mammary gland health. Rainard and Foucras76 discussed the potential direct effects of either intramammary infusion or topical application of probiotics, either lactic acid-producing bacteria or Bacillus sp., that can inhibit the growth of mastitis causing pathogens in a teat dip as a more promising route of administration to improve mammary gland health.

The primary mechanisms of action are to stimulate total rumen bacterial population densities, shift or stabilize the balance of rumen bacterial populations, utilize lactic acid, and reduce the risk for ruminal acidosis, and maintain a low oxygen rumen environment.78, 79, 80, 81 Newbold and colleagues78 designed well-controlled experiments to elucidate the mechanisms by which live yeast supplements may increase rumen bacterial population densities. Oxygen utilization by live yeast supplements seems to be an important mechanism improving the growth of rumen bacteria. Silberberg and colleagues81 supplemented a live yeast during repeated rumen acidosis challenges and reported improvements in rumen pH, a more stabilized rumen bacteria population, and less systemic inflammation. Another microbial strategy to aid in the prevention of rumen acidosis is a bolus inoculation with lactic acid-utilizing bacteria such as Megasphaera elsdenii. Arik and colleagues82 administered a bolus of lactic acid-utilizing bacteria to the rumen of Holstein heifers with M elsdenii for 2 consecutive days during a subacute ruminal acidosis challenge. They observed the M elsdenii-treated heifers had a slowed decrease in rumen pH, decreased concentrations of lactic acid-producing bacteria (Streptococcus bovis), and increased protozoa counts. These studies support the notion that microbial supplementation strategies can improve rumen function and health.",

Thus, supplementing yeast cell wall extracts with MOS may be a useful prevention strategy for those animals impacted by greater exposure to gram-negative pathogenic bacteria.10 Because adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to host mucosal surfaces is generally required for an infection in the GIT, the binding of MOS to these fimbriae decreases potential pathogenic adherence to the host GIT mucosa. The impacts of MOS on specific immune responses are not well characterized. Furthermore, complicating interpretation of data is that MOS extracts are predominately yeast cell wall extracts that also contain various glucan fractions including BGs.

Oral supplementation of BG fractions or yeast cell wall extracts can increase phagocytosis and oxidative burst capacities of immune cells as well as activate an inflammatory response through a nuclear factor \u03baB-mediated pathway. Oral supplementation of BG also affects systemic immune responses in addition to local GIT immune responses. The mechanism of action of BGs is thought to be mediated through specialized M cells that sample intestinal lumen contents. This increased awareness of the immune system allows for mediated inflammation and an enhanced ability of macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells to identify, engulf, and destroy pathogenic bacteria before they have the opportunity to establish an infection in the host.10, 86\n",

However, it does seem that an appreciable, biological amount of MOS and BG does influence lower GIT because supplementing yeast cell wall extracts reduced stress-related disease, improved mammary gland health, and increased milk production.87, 88 Supplementation strategies of yeast cell wall extracts seem to be most effective during periods of stress or increased pathogen exposure. Another application for yeast cell wall extracts is to alleviate some of the negative effects of hydrophobic mycotoxins such as zearalenone. Jouany and colleagues89 reported that BG interacted with zearalenone, in an \u201cadsorption type\u201d chemical interaction. Both Pereyra and colleagues90 and Fruhauf and colleagues91 reported that commercial yeast cell wall extracts with the greatest MOS and BG content adsorbed zearalenone to the greatest extent but were not effective at adsorbing aflatoxin, a hydrophilic mycotoxin. Therefore, a common mycotoxin strategy is to combine a mineral clay and a yeast cell wall extract to gain a more broad-spectrum mycotoxin adsorption capability.",

By improving aspects of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, calves supplemented with polyphenols may have an improved immune response following vaccination.42 Hydrolysable tannins may be able to reduce intraluminal oxidation thereby increasing dietary vitamin E bioavailability, suggesting a potential mechanism for antioxidants to improve health.41\n",

Essential oils (EOs) provide a plant with its unique color and fragrance. Chemically, EOs are composed of a lipophilic mixture of terpenoids, phenolics, and a variety of low-molecular-weight compounds.1, 95 The antibacterial mode of action of volatile oils is likely multifactorial with hypothesized mechanisms including disruption of biochemical pathways associated with cell membranes and passage of low-molecular-weight EO derivatives across inner plasma membranes of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. By interrupting cellular energy metabolism, EOs can partially inhibit bacterial growth and functionality and have demonstrated microbicidal effects against common food-borne pathogens, rumen bacteria, and gastrointestinal parasites (see Fig. 2).1 Most of the immunologic effects of EOs were investigated in monogastric species. Receptor-mediated responses upon EO supplementation can result in improved mucosal blood flow, altered cytokine and neuropeptide release, and modified immune cell functionality. Volatile oils undergo significant ruminal biodegradation, likely limiting the immunomodulatory and antibacterial effects.44 Of the published studies of EOs performed specifically on ruminants, oregano, garlic, and Capsicum oleoresin oils were shown have potential health and immunomodulatory effects.",

The balance of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA in cellular membranes influences the quantity and biological potency of the eicosanoids produced. Generally, eicosanoids from omega-3 PUFAs have a reduced affinity for cyclooxygenase enzymes.

The linoleic fatty acid compositions used in the study of Garcia and colleagues likely reflect milk diets based on milk fat (low linoleic acid) and those in which the primary fat source is based on lard (high linoleic acid). The exact PUFA composition or balance of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFAs in milk solids that improves immune responses and overall health remains to be determined. Finally, although short-chain fatty acids are not PUFAs it is important to emphasize their importance in GIT development as we discussed previously in the section on probiotics. Supplementing short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate can improve GIT development and calf performance.61 Furthermore, the effect may be more pronounced in milk replacer diets in which the primary fat source is not milk fat. Milk fat already contains a significant quantity of butyrate; however, the exact concentrations of these short-chain fatty acids to supplement in milk replacer are not known.59, 61\n",

Feeding whole flaxseed as a source of the omega-3 PUFA, specifically \u03b1-linolenic acid, from calving until 105 days in milk (DIM) decreased the serum concentrations of the proinflammatory eicosanoid, prostaglandin E2.63 Furthermore, decreasing the omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA ratio using calcium salts of fish oil from 14 to 105 DIM decreased the proinflammatory response following a mild intramammary LPS challenge.62 In contrast, there was no difference in the proinflammatory response in cows when challenged with 10 times the dose of LPS in the mammary gland at 7 DIM whether they were supplemented with fish oil or not.64 The authors attributed the lack of an effect on the severity of the LPS challenge. Silvestre and colleagues65 supplemented 1.5% of the total DM as safflower oil as a source of omega-6 PUFA from 30 d prepartum to 35 DIM. Observations included increased plasma acute-phase proteins, neutrophil proinflammatory cytokines, neutrophil L-selectin, and neutrophil phagocytic and oxidative burst capacities during the periparturient period. Furthermore, cows were switched to a breeding diet at 35 DIM that contained 1.5% of the total DM as calcium salts of fish oil and fed through 160 DIM. Supplementing cows with the calcium salts of fish oil decreased neutrophil proinflammatory cytokine secretion. These data further support that the balance of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFAs in the diets of both calves and cows can influence various immune responses. However, it remains to be determined at what age, physiologic stage, and conditions more inflammation is desirable and vice versa when less inflammation is preferred.105, 106\n",

There remains significant ambiguity regarding nutraceuticals because this field is evolving at a rapid pace without regulatory oversight. In this review, we broadly classify and discuss nutraceuticals as either probiotics, prebiotics, phytonutrients, or PUFAs. These compounds work through various mechanisms of action including stabilizing commensal microbial communities, improving mucosal immune responses and barrier function, binding or adsorbing potential pathogens or toxins, improving antioxidant capacity, direct antimicrobial activity, and increasing or decreasing systemic immune responses.",
