The genomes of coronaviruses and rotaviruses encode 2\u2032,5\u2032\u2010phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that degrade 2\u20135A and prevent its cellular accumulation, thereby blocking RNase L activation. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), an enveloped (+)RNA virus of the coronavirus family, expresses a cytoplasmic 30\u2010kDa 2\u2032,5\u2032\u2010phosphodiesterase protein ns2 that functions as an IFN antagonist and is required for the induction of hepatitis.11, 12, 13 Group A rotavirus (RVA), a member of the rotavirus family of segmented dsRNA viruses that cause severe infant diarrhea, encodes the capping enzyme VP3 that contains a C\u2010terminal phosphodiesterase domain [Fig. 1(A)].14 Both the VP3 PDE domain and ns2 have been shown to cleave 2\u20135A in vitro and in vivo, thereby antagonizing RNaseL activation while enhancing viral growth and pathogenesis.14, 16 The proteins share 18% sequence identity [Fig. 1(B)] and are functionally interchangeable, as the VP3 PDE domain is able to rescue the replication of ns2 mutant MHV in cells expressing RNase L.14 MHV ns2 and the C\u2010terminal domain of RVA VP3 are members of the 2H phosphoesterase family and contain two characteristic His\u2010X\u2010Ser/Thr motifs in their catalytic sites. Both proteins are structurally homologous to A\u2010kinase\u2010anchoring protein\u20107 (AKAP7), a 2H phosphoesterase domain\u2010containing protein that mediates signaling within cAMP microdomains by anchoring multiple signaling proteins.17 AKAP7 exhibits 2\u2032,5\u2032\u2010phosphodiesterase activity and can complement an inactive ns2 gene in a MHV mutant to restore infectivity of the virus.18\n",

AKAP7 adopts a globular \u03b1\u2010\u03b2 architecture consisting of four \u03b1\u2010helices and eight \u03b2\u2010sheets.30 In contrast to AKAP7 and a predicted structural model of the VP3 PDE domain,14 the crystal structure of the VP3 PDE domain lacks two \u03b1\u2010helical segments and one \u03b2\u2010strand in the upper lobe. The DALI search additionally identified human 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exoribonuclease USB131 (C16orf57, PDB ID 4H7W), 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 RNA ligases from Pyrococcus horikoshii\n32 (PDB ID 1VDX) and Thermus thermophilus\n33 (PDB ID 1 IUH) and the 1\u2032\u20132\u2032\u2010cyclic nucleotide 2\u2032\u2010phosphodiesterase from Arabidopsis thaliana\n34 (PDB ID 1JH7) as close structural homologs, all of which contain the two additional \u03b1\u2010helices in their upper lobes. The observed differences in secondary and tertiary structures are likely in part due to the diversity of substrate specificities across the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily. Nevertheless, the overall structural similarity underscores a clear evolutionary relationship of VP3 to vertebrate 2H phosphoesterase domain\u2010containing proteins including AKAP7, USB1, as well as CGI\u201018 and LENG9.27 This supports the hypothesis that a vertebrate host phosphodiesterase served as the ancestral precursor of 2\u2032,5\u2032\u2010phosphodiesterases harbored by rotaviruses and coronaviruses.18\n",

In neither case were we able to observe electron density corresponding to the bound cleavage product. Closer inspection of the crystal packing interfaces revealed that in all four copies in the asymmetric unit, the catalytic site of the VP3 PDE domain is blocked by the insertion of a loop (Ser759\u2010Asp760) from a symmetry\u2010related molecule, likely explaining the lack of ligand binding in the structure. Comparison of the active sites of AKAP7 and the VP3 PDE domain reveals that the catalytic His\u2010X\u2010Thr motifs are found in equivalent positions, suggesting that the catalytic mechanism of substrate cleavage is conserved in the two proteins. We therefore modeled the binding of the ligand in the active site of the VP3 PDE domain based on the superposition with the structure of AKAP7 in complex with 5\u2032\u2010AMP (PDB ID 2FVK). In AKAP7, both active site threonines donate hydrogen bonds to the phosphate oxygen atoms of the AMP product, while His224 of the second catalytic motif (equivalent to His797 in VP3) forms an additional hydrogen bond to the bridging ester oxygen [Fig. 2(B)]. A similar binding mode is expected in VP3, with the phosphate group being hydrogen\u2010bonded to Thr720 and Thr799. The adenine moiety of the AMP ligand is sandwiched between the side chains of Arg219 and Phe179 in AKAP7, the two residues interacting with the base via cation\u2010\u03c0 and \u03c0\u2010\u03c0 stacking interactions, respectively.30 While the conserved Arg792 likely fulfills the same function in VP3, the phenylalanine position is occupied by Leu758, suggesting that the precise mode of product binding might differ slightly between VP3 and AKAP7. Assuming that the bound AMP represents the product cleaved off from the 2\u2032 terminus of the 2\u20135A substrate, the adenosine residue upstream of the scissile phosphate would likely bind in the vicinity of amino acid residues Phe700, Val723, Tyr821, Arg823, and Ile825, in a conserved pocket adjacent to the catalytic site [Figs. 1(B,C) and 2(B)].",

His718 acts as a general acid to donate a proton to the 2\u2032\u2010oxygen of the leaving group. The 2\u2032\u20135\u2032\u2010oligoadenylate substrate is depicted in red.",
