We speculate that the supplement use becomes more irregular after early childhood. On the contrary, the incidence of atopic sensitization increased with age. One might expect an association between 25OHD and atopy (or other atopic characteristics) in these kinds of circumstances (2), but we did not find it in age-adjusted analysis. A recent casecontrol study by Stenberg et al. (6) reported an association between vitamin D insufficiency and wheezing in young children, but they did not find an association between vitamin D status and atopy-related factors. A few studies of young children without wheezing, or of older children, have reported an inverse association between the 25OHD level and atopic dermatitis or severity of atopic dermatitis (2, 7, 8) . The differences between our finding and these other studies may be explained by the adequate mean 25OHD concentration in our study population (86 nmol/l).

Urashima et al. (10) studied the effect of vitamin D intake on susceptibility to influenza A infections in Japanese school children and reported an inverse effect. However, they did not measure serum 25OHD levels. A population-based study of Science et al. (9) reported that low serum 25OHD levels are associated with increased risk of acute respiratory infections. Compared to our study, the median levels of serum 25OHD were again lower in this study (62 nmol/l), which may explain the significant associations. Our study has some limitations. Our sample size was rather small. Moreover, as few children had 25OHD levels <50 nmol/ l, vitamin D deficiency could not be investigated.
