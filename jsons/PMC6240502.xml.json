Coronaviruses infect a wide range of animal species including humans, causing a diverse array of diseases but each coronavirus tends to be species-specific. Coronaviruses are subdivided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma and delta-coronaviruses, based on phylogenetic clustering (Adams et al., 2017). Feline, ferret and mink coronaviruses belong to the alphacoronaviruses genus and typically cause self-limiting diarrheal disease in cats, ferrets and minks, respectively. Ferrets and minks are members of the family Mustelidae that includes carnivorous mammals such as badgers, weasels, otters and wolverines. Ferrets are presumed to have been domesticated for more than two thousand years (Thomson, 1951), and over the years ferrets have become more popular as pets. They are also widely used as a small animal model in the study of some human viral infections, such as influenza A virus (Belser et al., 2011) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Gretebeck and Subbarao, 2015).",

Minks over four months of age are mostly affected by ECG.

            "text": "The morbidity of these coronavirus diarrheal diseases in ferrets and minks is high but mortality is generally low unless the infected animals have concurrent illnesses, such as Aleutian disease (Gorham et al., 1990). Interestingly, a systemic disease associated with ferret coronavirus has appeared in 2002 in the US and the EU and subsequently in Asia (Autieri et al., 2015; Garner et al., 2008; Gnirs et al., 2016; Lindemann et al., 2016; Terada et al., 2014). Ferrets affected with this novel ferret systemic coronavirus disease (FSCV) exhibit weight loss, diarrhea, anorexia and granulomatous lesions in various organs and occasional neurological signs, which indicate that a quite different disease pathogenesis is involved in this progressively fatal disease (Garner et al., 2008; Gnirs et al., 2016). This recently emerged FSCV in ferrets resembles feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal systemic disease in cats. Similar to ferret and mink coronavirus infections, feline coronavirus typically causes self-limiting diarrhea and is quite common among cats especially in high-density environments with high morbidity and low mortality [reviewed in (Pedersen, 2014)]. However, a small number of cats infected with feline coronavirus develop FIP (Garner et al., 2008; Graham et al., 2012; Lindemann et al., 2016; Michimae et al., 2010; Wise et al., 2010). The mechanism responsible for the transition from enteric viral infection to FIP is not fully understood, but the prevailing hypothesis is that viral tropism change from the intestinal enterocytes to macrophages and the inadequate cellular immunity to eliminate the mutated viruses are the major contributors to FIP development in individual cats (Barker et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2012a; Licitra et al., 2013; Pedersen et al., 2009, 2012).",

            "text": "Although these coronaviruses are important pathogens for animals, no effective vaccine or treatment is yet available. Thus, development of effective treatment options for these coronavirus infections is expected to provide significant benefits to these animals. Moreover, effective antiviral therapeutics that combats multiple coronaviruses would provide considerable benefits since substantial resources are needed for antiviral drug development. Coronaviruses encode two viral proteases, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease, which process viral polyproteins into mature proteins. Due to the essential nature of viral proteases in virus replication, efforts have been made to identify inhibitors that target these viral proteases of important human and animal coronaviruses (Adedeji and Sarafianos, 2014; De Clercq, 2006; Deng et al., 2014; Hilgenfeld, 2014; Kim et al., 2012, 2013, 2015; Kumar et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2005). However, most of the research on coronavirus protease inhibitors has focused on SARS coronavirus, and relatively few reports are available for animal coronaviruses.",

The chemical structures of the compounds and their IC50 values are listed in Table 1. GC376 was previously shown to be effective in cats with experimental or naturally-occurring FIP (Kim et al., 2016b; Pedersen et al., 2018). Therefore, GC376 was included as a reference compound. The IC50 values of GC376 against ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpro were determined at 1.33 and 1.44 \u03bcM, respectively, moderately higher than the IC50 of 0.49 \u03bcM against feline coronavirus 3CLpro. A warhead is a reactive functional group on a compound, which interacts with the cysteine residue in the active site of 3CLpro. When the bisulfite adduct warhead [CH(OH)SO3Na] at R4 on GC376 was replaced with an \u03b1-ketoamide warhead, (CO)CONHcyclohexyl (GC523), the activity was moderately decreased against feline coronavirus 3CLpro, but less pronounced changes in activity were observed against ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpros. Replacement of Leu (isobutyl) at R3 in GC376 with Cha (cyclohexyl methyl) (GC551) did not change the activity against feline coronavirus 3CLpro and only slightly increased the activity against ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpros. This result suggest that Leu and Cha are functionally interchangeable for all three 3CLpros. The similar effect of Leu and Cha at R3 position against these coronavirus 3CLpros was also demonstrated by GC583 and GC597. The substitution of a benzyl group (C6H5) at R1 with m-Chloro benzyl group in compounds with a bisulfide adduct warhead (GC551 and GC587) resulted in increased activities against all three 3CLpros. The bisulfite adduct at R4 (GC551 and GC587) resulted in increased activities compared to aldehyde counterparts (GC543 and GC583) against all three 3CLpros. The replacement of aldehyde or bisulfite adduct at R4 in GC583 or GC587, respectively, with (CO)CONHcyclopropyl (GC591) led to remarkably decreased activity against all 3CLpros (>40-fold increases of IC50 values). The replacement of O(CO)NH at R2 in GC583 with a sulfonamide linkage (SO2NH) (GC772) led to a substantial decrease in activity against all 3CLpros. The replacement of m-Chloro benzyl group at R1 in GC772 with p-Chloro benzyl (GC774) did not affect the activity against feline coronavirus 3CLpro, but further decreased the activity against ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpros.",

A number of studies have been published on coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors but previous reports have largely focused on SARS-coronavirus (Deng et al., 2014; Jacobs et al., 2013; Konno et al., 2013) and more recently on MERS-coronavirus, and only a few studies are available on 3CLpro inhibitors for multiple coronaviruses. The 3CLpro inhibitors that are active against two or more coronaviruses have been reported by our and other groups (Kim et al., 2012, 2016b; Prior et al., 2013) (reviewed in (Hilgenfeld, 2014). We have previously shown that GC376, a reversible inhibitor of 3CLpro, is efficacious in treating cats with experimental (Kim et al., 2016b) or naturally-occurring FIP (Pedersen et al., 2018). This inhibitor is also active against human and animal coronaviruses and other viruses that encode 3C protease or 3CLpro in vitro, including viruses in the Caliciviridae or Picornaviridae families (Kim et al., 2012, 2015, 2016b). In this study, we evaluated the activity of a focused library of 3CLpro inhibitors including GC376 against ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpros, as well as feline coronavirus 3CLpro, to investigate the relationship between structure and activity of these inhibitors for these viruses.",

            "text": "Our structure-activity relationship study using the FRET assay showed that, in general, the tested compounds have similar activities against feline, ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpros. In prior reports, we demonstrated that R3 variations (Leu or Cha) in our dipeptidyl compound series significantly affect the activity against human norovirus 3CLpro (Galasiti Kankanamalage et al., 2015). However, in this study, Leu or Cha at R3 did not lead to significant difference in the activity against coronavirus 3CLpros (Table 1). Substitution of a benzyl group at R1 with m-Chloro benzyl group in the compounds with bisulfide adduct warhead resulted in increased activities against all 3CLpros, and this was also observed in compounds against human norovirus 3CLpros in enzyme and cell based assays (Galasiti Kankanamalage et al., 2015). We have previously reported that compounds with a bisulfite adduct warhead are converted to the precursor aldehyde form (Kim et al., 2012), and that the bisulfite adducts and their aldehyde forms have comparable inhibitory activity against viral replication or 3CLpro (Kim et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2015). The present study also shows the bisulfite adducts (GC551 and GC587) have similar or slightly higher activity than their aldehyde counterparts (GC543 and GC583, respectively) against all 3CLpros. However, the replacement of aldehyde or bisulfite adduct with \u03b1-ketoamide warhead, (CO)CONHcyclohexyl (GC523) or (CO)CONHcyclopropyl (GC591), at R4 resulted in a marginal (GC523) or marked reduction (GC591) in the activity against these coronavirus 3CLpros (Table 1). These results suggest these \u03b1-ketoamide groups as a warhead are generally less tolerated than aldehyde or bisulfide adduct for these coronavirus 3CLpros. Previously, we found that ketoamide groups as a warhead are associated with reduced activity against human norovirus 3CLpro (Mandadapu et al., 2012), but not against some picornavirus 3CLpros (Kim et al., 2016a), compared to aldehyde or bisulfite counterparts. Lastly, the importance of a carboxyl group at R2 was demonstrated by the substantial decrease in the activity against all three 3CLpros when it was changed to a sulfonyl group (Table 1).",

However, despite the differences in the activities of the compounds against these 3CLpros, it is notable that the compounds with strong inhibitory activity against feline coronavirus 3CLpro, including GC376, also exhibit potent activity against ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpros with sub- or low micromolar IC50 values in the FRET assay. Among those compounds, GC587 exhibited most potent inhibition against all three 3CLpros with EC50 of 0.15\u20130.6 \u03bcM. GC587 is a variation of GC376 with modifications at R1 and R3, which is a further optimized compound toward human norovirus 3CLpro (Galasiti Kankanamalage et al., 2015).",

These constructed 3CLpro models closely overlap with the crystal structure of feline coronavirus 3CLpro in the overall structure and in the active site topography (Fig. 3A and B and Fig.4), revealing the highly conserved nature of 3CLpro among these viruses. Previously, we identified five residues in TGEV 3CLpro that interact with GC376 in a crystallographic study of TGEV 3CLpro-GC376 complex (Kim et al., 2012). TGEV 3CLpro has a very high amino acid homology of over 92% with feline coronavirus 3CLpro, and GC376 exhibits comparable antiviral activity against both viruses (Kim et al., 2012). Multiple sequence alignments of 3CLpros of TGEV, feline, ferret and mink coronaviruses revealed that these amino acids, as well as the catalytic residues C144 and H41, are conserved at the same positions. When the crystal structures of TGEV and feline coronavirus 3CLpros and the structural models of ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpros were superposed, the residues that are likely to interact with GC376 are positioned close together (Fig. 4), which may explain the potent activity of GC376 against these coronavirus 3CLpros.",

The antiviral activities of the compounds are generally in line with the results of the FRET assay with low cytotoxicity, which indicate they are cell-permeable and have a wide margin of in vitro safety. It is worth noting that several compounds, including GC376, an inhibitor with a demonstrated therapeutic potential in cats with FIP, also exhibited strong inhibitory activity against ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpros. These results suggest that GC376 or its derivatives may have the potential to be developed as antiviral drugs for feline, ferret and mink coronavirus infections.
