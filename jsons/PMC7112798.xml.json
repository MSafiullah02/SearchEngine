            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a species in the genus Betacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, is one of the most prevalent viruses in mouse colonies throughout the world. MHV, which has a 31-kb single-strand positive RNA genome, changes through mutation and genetic recombination and can be classified serologically into many strains (Lai, 1996, Makino et al., 1986). The strains are divided into two groups, enterotropic or polytropic, according to patterns of tissue tropism, tendency to disseminate, and virulence (Homberger et al., 1998). Enterotropic strains, such as D, DVIM, and NuU, are less virulent than polytropic strains, such as 1, 2, 3, JHM, and A59; adult immunocompetent mice infected with enterotropic strains show no clinical symptoms (Homberger, 1997). However, enterotropic strains are considered to be more contagious than polytropic strains. MHV infection can seriously affect the quality of biomedical research (Boorman et al., 1982, Cook-Mills et al., 1992, Torrecilhas et al., 1999). MHV can also cause a chronic wasting disease that eventually results in death in immunocompromised mice such as athymic nude mice. MHV is transmitted by contact with apparently healthy carrier mice through respiratory aerosols, feces, direct contact, and fomites. Early detection of carrier mice is therefore very important for eliminating this highly contagious infection from mouse colonies. For this purpose, methods of directly detecting viral RNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been developed (Besselsen et al., 2002, Casebolt et al., 1997, Homberger et al., 1991, Matthaei et al., 1998, Smith et al., 2002, Wang et al., 1999, Yamada et al., 1998). However, RT-PCR is a time-consuming and labor-intensive detection method and is highly prone to cross contamination between samples.",

            "text": "An isothermal gene amplification technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been developed using a specially designed primer set and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity (Notomi et al., 2000). The simple addition of a reverse transcriptase to the reaction enables the technique to amplify RNA molecules (RT-LAMP). The principles of the LAMP reaction have been well documented by the developers (Notomi et al., 2000, Tomita et al., 2008). RT-LAMP has several advantages over RT-PCR. RT-LAMP can be carried out at a constant temperature in a single tube, and the reaction can be completed typically within 1 h (Kubo et al., 2010, Lan et al., 2009, Thai et al., 2004). The result can be judged by the naked eye without opening the reaction tube, using a metal indicator, hydroxy naphthol blue (Goto et al., 2009). The theoretical specificity of RT-LAMP is superior to that of RT-PCR because of the use of 4 oligonucleotide primers that recognize a total of 6 distinct sequences. In other words, it is more difficult to design a set of LAMP primers than to design a pair of PCR primers for RNA viruses that mutate frequently (Arita et al., 2009, Dinh et al., 2011, Fukuda et al., 2006).This study aimed to develop a convenient and rapid molecular diagnostic technique for MHV infection. To accomplish this objective, a set of broadly reactive LAMP primers specific for rodent coronaviruses was designed. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay was compared with the existing RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR assays using isolated viruses. Finally, the diagnostic capability of the assay was examined using mouse fecal specimens.",

MHV-2-CC, MHV-JHM-CC, and MHV-A59-CC are low-virulence mutants of the respective strains 2, JHM, and A59 (Hirano et al., 1984). Viruses were propagated in DBT cells cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM), and virus titers were determined using a plaque assay as reported previously (Hirano et al., 1974). Rat coronavirus Parker strain (RCV-Parker) and 5 strains of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV-681, SDAV-930, SDAV-K, SDAV-L-1, and SDAV-M) were grown in LBC cells cultured in EMEM (Hirano et al., 1985, Hirano et al., 1986). Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus strain 67N (HEV-67N), HEV-NT9, and HEV-VW3 were grown in SK-K cells cultured in EMEM (Hirano et al., 1990). Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain 3 (PEDV-3) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus strain TO (TGEV-TO) were grown in Vero and CPK cells, respectively, cultured in EMEM (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988, Honda et al., 1990). Two strains of bovine coronavirus (BCV-Kakegawa and BCV-Nebraska) were grown in BEK-1 cells cultured in EMEM containing 10% (v/v) tryptose phosphate broth (Inaba et al., 1976). Human coronavirus strain OC43 (HCV-OC43), which had been stored at \u221280 \u00b0C in a suckling mouse brain, was prepared as a 10% (w/v) mouse brain homogenate in EMEM. Each supernatant was collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C after removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 5000 \u00d7 \ng for 5 min.",

            "text": "MHV is one of the most prevalent viruses of laboratory mice, following murine noroviruses and mouse parvoviruses (Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009). Mice infected with the enterotropic strains of MHV shed the viruses in feces for long periods, although the infected mice show no clinical symptoms (Compton et al., 2004, Smith et al., 2002). Endemic infection in mouse colonies is maintained by the continual arrival of susceptible mice, including newborns. Thus, controlling and detecting MHV in mouse colonies is very important for microbiological quality control in laboratory animal facilities. In this study, a broadly reactive RT-LAMP assay specific for rodent coronaviruses was developed. As in the case for PCR, primer design is the most crucial step for developing a successful LAMP assay. In general, specific gene amplification requires perfect base pairing between the 3\u2032 end of a primer and the target gene (Dieffenbach et al., 1993). In the case of the LAMP reaction, perfect base pairings between the 5\u2032 end of both F1c and B1c primer regions and the target gene are also necessary for specific gene amplification. The perfect base pairings of both the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of F1c and B1c primer regions enable the formation of a dumbbell-shaped stem-loop DNA in the LAMP reaction that serves as the starting template for exponential DNA synthesis (Notomi et al., 2000, Tomita et al., 2008). At first, the primers against the nucleocapsid gene were designed, because RT-LAMP primers specific for other coronaviruses such as HCV-NL63 (Pyrc et al., 2011), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Chen et al., 2010a, Chen et al., 2010b), TGEV (Chen et al., 2010a, Chen et al., 2010b, Li and Ren, 2011), and PDEV (Ren and Li, 2011) were designed for the gene encoding the nucleocapsid. In addition, the number of subgenomic mRNAs encoding the nucleocapsid is higher than those of any other genomic and subgenomic mRNAs (Pyrc et al., 2004). However, the RT-LAMP primers designed by the PrimerExplore software in the gene encoding the nucleocapsid did not satisfy the criteria for LAMP primers, i.e., the melting temperature, stability of each primer end, GC content, and secondary structure, when tested against the genes of several MHV strains available in GenBank. It was then investigated whether RT-LAMP primers for other coronaviruses satisfy the criteria of LAMP primers against all target genes available in GenBank. The investigation showed that for several isolates, the primers for IBV, TGEV, and PDEV did not satisfy the criteria (data not shown). We accordingly abandoned the plan of designing broadly reactive RT-LAMP primers in the nucleocapsid gene of rodent coronaviruses. Finally, we succeeded in designing the RT-LAMP primers in the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome that satisfied the criteria of LAMP primers against all rodent coronavirus genes available in GenBank. With the designed primers, gene amplification occurred only in the presence of rodent coronavirus RNA. Sequence specificity was confirmed by the lack of amplification of non-rodent coronavirus RNA from species in the genera Betacoronavirus (HCV-OC43, HEV, and BCV) and Alphacoronavirus (TGEV and PEDV). Sequence specificity was also confirmed by the absence of gene amplification in the presence of RNA purified from MHV-free mouse fecal specimens (data not shown).",

However, a homology analysis using the Genetyx-Mac program showed that there are four mismatches between the sense primer and MHV-2 gene, three of which are located in the 3\u2032-terminal area (data not shown).

The detection sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was 3.2 times higher than that of the RT-PCR assay and 31.6 times lower than that of the nested RT-PCR assay. This sensitivity was lower than expected, given that RT-LAMP had been reported to show 100-fold higher sensitivities than conventional RT-PCR (Thai et al., 2004, Lan et al., 2009). The inferior performance may have been due to the use of different target genes, given that the 5\u2032-end sequence (target of RT-LAMP) is contained only on the full-length viral RNA. By contrast, the E1 gene (target of RT-PCR) and the N gene (target of nested RT-PCR) are contained on not only the genomic RNA but also numerous subgenomic mRNAs. The limiting dilution assay also indicated that the replicate RT-LAMP would improve detection sensitivity over single RT-LAMP particularly at lower concentrations of the target gene. Accordingly, the diagnostic performance of the RT-LAMP assay was examined in duplicate. In 69 mouse fecal specimens, the sensitivity and specificity of the duplicate RT-LAMP assay with respect to the nested RT-PCR assay were 87.5% and 100%, respectively.",

These advantages make the assay amenable to high-throughput diagnostics by eliminating both post-amplification processing and the risk of carryover contamination. The defects of the RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR assays have also been solved by real-time RT-PCR technology (Smith et al., 2002). However, real-time RT-PCR needs expensive detection instrument and restricts its use to laboratories with good financial resources. Thus, it is another advantage for laboratories with limited financial resources that the isothermal RT-LAMP assay can be carried out with conventional instrument.",

A serological assay is therefore the most efficient method to expose the history of MNV contamination rather than the current status of infection in a mouse colony. However, the assay does not work in immunocompromised mice or immunocompetent mice in the early phase of infection. To compensate for these limitations, fecal RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR have often been employed for screening mice actively infected with MHV. Casebolt et al. (1997) reported that an enterotropic MHV genome was detected in mouse fecal specimens by nested RT-PCR beginning on day 3 through day 21 after oral inoculation. However, it is dangerous to put too much trust in the NAT, given that MHV strains vary in organotropism and that not all feces from the same mouse may contain viral genes. In conclusion, a combination of RT-LAMP and serological assays is proposed be a more convenient and effective method of diagnosis for MHV infection in mouse colonies.",
