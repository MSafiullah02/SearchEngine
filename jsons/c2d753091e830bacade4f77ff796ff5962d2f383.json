            "text": "The difficulty in distinguishing between septicemic and nonsepticemic diarrheic calves prompted a study of variables to predict septicemia in diarrheic calves \u03fd28 days old that were presented to a referral institution. The prevalence of septicemia in the study population was 31%. Variables whose values were significantly different (P \u03fd .10) between septicemic and nonsepticemic diarrheic calves were selected using stepwise, forward, and backward logistic regression. Variables identified as potentially useful predictors were used in the final model-building process. Two final models were selected: 1 based on all possible types of predictors (laboratory model) and 1 based only on demographic data and physical examination results (clinical model). In the laboratory model, 5 variables retained significance: serum creatinine \u03fe 5.66 mg/dL (\u03fe500 mol/L) (odds ratio [OR] \u03ed 8.63, P \u03ed .021), toxic changes in neutrophils \u0546 2\u03e9 (OR \u03ed 2.88, P \u03ed .026), failure of passive transfer (OR \u03ed 2.72, P \u03ed .023), presence of focal infection (OR \u03ed 2.68, P \u03ed .024), and poor suckle reflex (OR \u03ed 4.10, P \u03ed .019). Four variables retained significance in the clinical model: age \u0545 5 days (OR \u03ed 2.58, P \u03ed .006), presence of focal infection (OR \u03ed 2.45, P \u03ed .006), recumbency (OR \u03ed 2.98, P \u03ed .011), and absence of a suckling reflex (OR \u03ed 3.03, P \u03ed .031). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit chi-square statistics for the laboratory and clinical models had P-values of .72 and .37, respectively, indicating that the models fit the observed data reasonably well. The laboratory model outperformed the clinical model by a small margin at a predictabilty cutoff of 0.5, however, the predictive abilities of the 2 models were quite similar. The low sensitivities (39% and 40%) of both models at a predicted probability cutoff of 0.5 meant many septicemic calves were not being detected by the models. The specificity of both models at a predicted probability cutoff of 0.5 was \u03fe90%, indicating that \u03fe90% of nonsepticemic calves would be predicted to be nonsepticemic by the 2 models. The positive and negative predictive values of the models were 66-82%, which indicated the proportion of cases for which a predictive result would be correct in a population with a prevalence of septicemia of 31%.",

            "text": "T he mortality risk of live-born neonatal calves \u03fd1 month of age has been reported to range from 15 to 30%. [1] [2] [3] [4] The majority of deaths are attributable to infectious diseases; diarrhea, pneumonia, and septicemia are the most common. [5] [6] [7] [8] The predominant pathogen cultured from calves with septicemia is Eschericia coli, but other gramnegative, gram-positive, and mixed bacterial infections have been documented. [9] [10] [11] [12] Important risk factors for the development of septicemia in calves include decreased passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins and exposure to invasive bacterial serotypes. 13 Neonatal diarrhea may also predispose calves to septicemia. In 2 separate studies conducted on a California veal operation, blood cultures revealed bacteremia in 31% and 19% of calves with signs of diarrhea, depression, and/ or weakness. 10, 14 Septicemia in these calves was attributed to intestinal mucosal damage caused by bacterial, viral, or parasitic gastrointestinal infections, which allowed opportunistic gut pathogens to enter the systemic circulation. 10 The early signs of septicemia in neonatal foals and calves are vague and nonspecific and are often indistinguishable from signs of noninfectious diseases or those of focal in-fections such as diarrhea. 14, 15 Positive blood cultures are required for a definitive antemortem diagnosis of septicemia, but results are not reported for 48-72 hours, and false-negative culture findings are common. 12, 16 No single laboratory test has emerged as being completely reliable for the early diagnosis of septicemia in farm animal neonates, 12, 17 therefore, various scoring systems and predictive models using easily obtainable historical, clinical, and clinicopathologic data have been developed for this purpose. 14, [17] [18] [19] The goal of these mathematical models is to identify septicemic neonates early in the course of disease when appropriate therapeutic intervention would most likely result in a favorable outcome.",

Results of this exercise indicated that septicemia was more common in diarrheic neonatal calves than we had anticipated and that it increased the cost of treatment while decreasing the prognosis for survival. A model capable of predicting sepsis in diarrheic neonatal calves presented to the hospital for treatment would assist the clinicians in distinguishing between calves with undifferentiated diarrhea and calves with diarrhea complicated by sepsis. In the case of a relatively low-value calf with diarrhea and predicted sepsis, the farmer may be advised not to initiate treatment because of the expense involved and the poor prognosis. In contrast, the owner of a valuable diarrheic calf that was predicted to be septic could be informed that early initiation of costly but appropriate antimicrobial and supportive therapy may result in an improved outcome.",

The prevalence of septicemia in this study was identical to that reported for calves with diarrhea, depression, and/or weakness on a veal raising facility, 14 which suggests that the predictive values of the models developed herein may be relevant to other calf populations. The risk of contamination of the blood sample for culturing probably was low, so it is unlikely that many truly nonsepticemic calves were misclassified as septicemic. However, because of the low sensitivity of blood cultures 24, 25 and the fact that blood was not cultured for some surviving calves, some truly septicemic calves may have been misclassified as nonsepticemic if they survived and were not subjected to postmortem examination. However, this misclassification probably was not common because (1) the calves survived, and the probability of survival was low if the calf was truly septicemic; and (2) the effect of misclassification of truly septicemic calves on the model would likely been a reduction in specificity, but low specificity was not a problem with either model. E coli was the bacterial agent cultured with greatest frequency from septicemic calves in this study, a finding that agrees with results of previous investigations 10, 12 and may be attributed to the fact that certain strains of E coli possess virulence factors that promote systemic invasion. 26 In addition to E coli, a variety of noncoliform bacteria were isolated. Of particular interest was the recovery of Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus from blood of 8 diarrheic calves (15% of the isolates from blood); there is only 1 previous report of this agent being cultured from a septicemic calf. 10 Possible explanations for the frequent isolation of Campylobacter spp. in this study were that the Oxoid Signal blood culture system was more effective than other blood culture systems for growing this agent or that there were unique predisposing factors leading to Campylobacter bacteremia in calves in our geographic location.",

Because Azotemia secondary to shock and dehydration was anticipated in both septicemic and nonsepticemic diarrheic calves presented for treatment, it was interesting to note that moderate and marked increases in serum creatinine concentration in this study increased the risk of a calf being septicemic by 2-and 8-fold, respectively. Moderate to severe azotemia in septicemic calves was attributed to endotoxin induced tubular necrosis and embolic nephritis, in addition to decreased renal perfusion associated with dehydration. Toxic changes in neutrophils, which are induced by inflammatory mediators and endotoxins, are frequently encountered in septicemic calves 12 ; therefore, inclusion of this variable in the laboratory model was not unexpected. Because the relationship between septicemia and failure of colostral antibody transfer has been documented in previous studies, 12,14 the increased risk of septicemia in calves with failure of passive transfer was also anticipated. Both the laboratory model and the clinical model indicated that the risk of septicemia in calves with identified sites of focal infection (omphalitis, arthritis, meningitis, uveitis) was more than double that of calves without evidence of focal infection. This association was biologically plausible because one of the initial sites of bacterial invasion in septicemic calves is the umbilicus, 13 and hematogenous spread of infection to the meninges, synovial lining, and uveal tract are known to occur. 12 Inclusion of poor suckling reflex by both models and recumbency by the clinical model as predictors of septicemia in a population of diarrheic calves presented for treatment was unforseen. The fluid, blood gas, and electrolyte derrangements associated with the diarrhea could have caused recumbency and disinterest in suckling in the majority of calves in the study. However, multiple organ invasion by bacterial pathogens and the cascade of inflammatory reactions initiated by these infecting agents were more likely responsible for the increased frequency of recumbency and poor suckling reflex in septicemic calves. The clinical model indicated that being \u03fd5 days of age increased the risk of septicemia by 2.5fold. This contrasts with results of a study conducted in veal calves where age \u03fe7 days significantly increased the risk of being blood culture positive. 14 The reason for this discrepancy between the 2 studies is unclear. Because most calves in the present study were presented for treatment in the winter months when all calves presented to the hospital would be born inside and there is increased stocking density in maternity pens, they could have been heavily exposed to pathogens early in life. The theory that enteritis predisposes calves \u03fe1 week of age to septicemia 10 was not supported by results of this study.",

The low sensitivities (39% and 40%) of both mod- els at a probability cutoff of 0.5 meant that many septicemic calves were not being detected by the models. One explanation is that other useful predictors of septicemia were not included in the models. However, with the exception of historical data pertaining to calving and management practices, most variables previously identified as risk factors in calves and foals were evaluated. 14, 17, 18 There may be no group of variables unique to the septicemic calf, partly because septicemia is a dynamic process and laboratory and clinical parameters can vary widely depending on when in the disease course the calf is evaluated.
