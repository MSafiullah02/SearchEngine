            "text": "The intestinal coccidium Cryptosporidium is known to cause self-limiting diarrhoea in neonates, especially calves. Animals are infected by oocysts from their environment and show clinical signs of disease (pasty to watery diarrhoea with dehydration) within a few days after infection which can last up to 2 weeks (Rommel, 2000). The large numbers of oocysts that are excreted together with the strong resistance of the exogenous stages against disinfection (Blewett, 1989, Fayer et al., 1996) can turn this parasite into a perpetual threat to animal health and productivity on affected farms. The parasite is found worldwide with prevalences in young calves of 20\u201340% in different European countries (Anon., 1996, Lentze et al., 1999; see Chermette and Boufassa-Ouzrout, 1988, de Graaf et al., 1999). Apart from the veterinary problems that Cryptosporidium can cause, it has the potential to cause zoonotic disease, especially in immunocompromised humans (Fayer et al., 2000, Slifko et al., 2000). In the present study we evaluated the prevalence of cryptosporidia in samples examined at veterinary laboratories and the estimation of investigators regarding the importance of this parasite. In a field trial the efficacy of sulfadimidine and halofuginone against cryptosporidiosis was tested.",

The evaluation included records of diarrhoea and/or enteritis in calves tested for Cryptosporidium. All five laboratories routinely tested for the parasite at post mortem examinations of calves up to 4 weeks of age with diarrhoea and in all faecal samples from calves submitted for post mortem examination. Parasitological examination was based on the staining method of direct smears according to Heine (1982), Pohlenz et al. (1978) or Henriksen and Pohlenz (1981) with semi-quantitative estimation of the intensity. In one case samples were examined using a coproantigen ELISA (Digestiv ELISA Kit\u00ae; Bio-X, Belgium). Additional tests included flotation of faecal samples (for Eimeria) as well as microbiological and virological tests for infectious causes of enteritis.",

This shows the prevalence of this parasite is probably underestimated\u2014only 2/3 of the laboratories included the parasite in their routine testing and considered it to be common; only 26% of the investigators estimated the prevalence to be more than 20%. The role of cryptosporidia as a primary cause of diarrhoea was acknowledged by only 1/5 of the investigators. The bias of samples submitted to the state laboratories does not allow direct comparison between field investigations and our retrospective evaluation. However, the examination of field samples from different parts of Germany shows that the prevalence of cryptosporidia in calves (up to the age of 6 months) ranges mostly from 20 to 30%, with 35\u201336% monoinfections (Heine and Boch, 1981, Stein et al., 1983, Fiedler, 1985, Schulz et al., 1989). Considering the fact that C. parvum is most prevalent in calves up to 4 weeks of age (Krogh and Henriksen, 1985, Schulz et al., 1989, de Graaf et al., 1999) this age group probably has considerably higher prevalences. The present data indicate that although cryptosporidia are acknowledged as primary pathogens (Pohlenz et al., 1978, Stein et al., 1983, Krogh and Henriksen, 1985, de Graaf et al., 1999), not all veterinarians seem to be aware of their prevalence and importance.",

Especially the high number of diarrhoeic calves in group 3 on d21 could be explained with this situation. Additionally, possible effects of coronavirus infections in group 3 might have reduced the health status of some animals (and even increase excretion rates of Cryptosporidium oocysts), but since virological examination was not done at that time a definitive cause for this phenomenon cannot be determined.",
