A previous study has revealed that patients with cancer are at increased risks of severe infections.3 Concerning deteriorating infection, most patients with cancer were recommended to withdraw cancer treatment after an infection. However, the risks of cancer progression make this issue controversial. Herein, we firstly reported a patient with cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2 who continued targeted therapy with stable cancer control and recovered from pneumonia after Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) treatment.",

After cancer progression in September 2017, EGFR T790M was detected, and osimertinib monotherapy was initiated. On December 30, 2019, the patient was admitted to the hospital for radiotherapy owing to enlarged lymph nodes. On January 18, 2020, the patient reported fever (temperature, 38.6\u00b0C), with symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, and diarrhea after nine rounds of radiation (Fig. 1\nA). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans on January 23 revealed patchy shadows in both lungs (Fig. 1\nB). After treatment with cefoselis, oseltamivir, meropenem, teicoplanin, and moxifloxacin, his fever was reduced. Considering that the patient had contact history of patients with COVID-19, he underwent tests for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR on January 26, and the result was positive. Thereafter, the patient started antiviral treatment with Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) on January 29. CT scan after 2 weeks (February 12) revealed improved pneumonia status (Fig. 1\nB). Follow-up RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 on February 1, 2, 5, and 10 revealed negative results, leading to confirmed recovery. The patient felt that his overall condition improved and was discharged from the hospital on February 14. Of note, the patient continued his targeted treatment with osimertinib because of slight discomfort during the infection period. Follow-up CT scan revealed stable lesions in both lungs, resulting in stable disease (Fig. 1\nB).",
