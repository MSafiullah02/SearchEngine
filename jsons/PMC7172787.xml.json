            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide [1] and is an important pathogen in elderly and high risk adults [2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that the global annual burden of infections and mortality due to human RSV are 64 million and 160,000, respectively [3]. In industrialized countries, nearly all children have been infected with RSV by 2 years of age [4]. Most infected children present with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, but a subset develops severe lower respiratory tract disease characterized by tachypnea, hyperinflation, crackles, and expiratory wheezing (i.e., bronchiolitis and pneumonia). The most severe disease occurs within the first months of life in largely full term, healthy infants. Data from the United States (US) and Australia suggest that 1.7\u20132.6% of infants are hospitalized for RSV infection before one year of age [5], [6], [7]. In the US, approximately 75,000\u2013100,000 infants less than 1 year of age [8], [9] and 132,000\u2013172,000 children less than 5 years of age [10] are hospitalized due to RSV disease annually. RSV is an important pathogen of children in daycare, where it accounts for a substantial portion of single-pathogen acute respiratory tract infections, as well as co-infections with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, or adenoviruses [11]. The clinical manifestations and morbidity of RSV are similar among infants and young children worldwide but mortality is much higher in the lesser developed countries due to availability of medical care [12].",

The efficacy is associated with inhibition of viral infection via binding to a 25 amino acid sequence known as \u201cantigenic site II\u201d on the RSV F protein which provides a rationale for an F based RSV vaccine containing this site [17]. Recent clinical trials have indicated that years of natural infection and thus exposure to live virus, induces little or no F specific site II antibodies [18].",

In the current study the production of vaccine-induced palivizumab competing antibodies (PCA) that bind to site II were studied in cotton rats to assess their relative potency, both in active and passive immunization. The studies were also controlled with RSV infection, which has been shown to induce very limited PCA in humans [18]. Finally, Lot 100 formalin inactivated RSV vaccine, used in the 1960's and associated with disease enhancement in children, allowed comparison of relative safety and the induction of functional immunity.",

After infection, cells are collected by centrifugation, washed with sterile PBS, and then lysed in the presence of NP9 to release membrane bound RSV F protein. The supernatant containing the RSV F protein is clarified using depth filtration and then purified by ion exchange (trimethylaminoethyl, TMAE) chromatography. The flow-through fraction is affinity purified using lentil lectin washed and eluted from the column with buffer containing methyl-\u03b1-d-mannopyranoside (MMP) and polysorbate (PS) 80. The eluted fraction was further purified by cation exchange (sulfate) chromatography.

Post-challenge lung virus titers (GMT) were just above the LOD in animals given the lowest dose of RSV F (0.003 \u03bcg) and were below the LOD in recipients of higher doses of RSV F vaccine (Fig. 5A). The RSV lung virus titer was 4.5 log10 in the placebo group (Fig. 5A). Palivizumab also reduced lung RSV titers to below the LOD, with more detectable virus in the lowest doses consistent to what has been previously observed [34]. Reduction of RSV titers in the nasal passages was also observed in a dose dependent manner for both the RSV F vaccine and palivizumab, with relatively lower virus levels in the RSV F vaccine group in concert with the levels of neutralizing titers induced (Fig. 5B). Thus, the RSV F vaccine was protective against non-homologous virus challenge in the upper and lower respiratory tract and appears to be a potent immunogen that provided protection via active immunization exceeding that seen with palivizumab, despite the use of very low doses of vaccine.",

The serially developed RSV prophylactic products, Respigam, palivizumab and motavizumab were first evaluated in cotton rats, a model that reliably predicted the clinical outcomes [16], [34], [39]. Based on these preclinical data, passive prophylaxis studies were advanced using palivizumab and motavizumab and were shown to reduce RSV-related hospitalization by 55\u201383% in preterm, high risk and term infants [14], [16], [40], [41]. In recent clinical studies, we found that vaccine elicited antibodies to the RSV F nanoparticle vaccine avidly bind to the site II epitope.

            "text": "The clinical development of an RSV vaccine may be divided amongst three populations: infants, infants/preschool children and the elderly. Maternal immunization, the active immunization of pregnant women to provide trans-placental transferred antibody for passive protection of the infant, is a priority strategy for protection of young infants against RSV and has been successfully employed for tetanus, pertussis and influenza vaccines [44]. Older infants and toddlers may also benefit from active immunization and many strategies including live viral vaccines and purified subunit vaccines have been employed in early clinical testing [45]. An RSV purified F protein showed clinical promise in children and CF patients, but proved difficult to manufacture and stabilize [22], [46]. The clinical evaluation of a novel vaccine must also take into account the history of the formalin inactivated RSV vaccine (Pfizer Lot 100 vaccine) that unexpectedly caused severe exacerbation of pulmonary disease in children who subsequently acquired RSV infections [33], [47]. Although the precise mechanisms underlying these findings remain open to debate [48], the phenomenon of vaccine-enhanced RSV disease was limited to RSV-na\u00efve infants immunized with FI-RSV and has not been observed either with passive antibody prophylaxis (monoclonal or polyclonal) in clinical trials using purified F protein vaccines in adults or older RSV-seropositive children [22], [46], [49]. Thus, the path forward for development of a vaccine in older infants and children will need to be carefully considered. However, a vaccine that induces high affinity antibodies that exhibit neutralization or fusion inhibition in vitro, largely absent in FI-RSV vaccinated infants [50], and is associated with protection without disease exacerbation in vivo in relevant animal models and finally shows efficacy in another setting such as maternal immunization may be considered in the absence of a licensed vaccine for this population. Finally, the RSV disease burden in elderly and high risk adults and the data indicating an F subunit vaccine is safe along with the absence of historical safety concerns due to enhanced disease in this population suggests further testing of the safety and efficacy as a seasonal respiratory vaccine is warranted. The induction of PCA by the RSV F nanoparticle vaccine provides an important rationale for further clinical evaluation in the relevant susceptible populations.",
