Initiation of immunosuppression should be considered in patients with diseases in which rapid deterioration of kidney function is expected and in those with severe nephrotic syndrome, which is accompanied by increased susceptibility to infections due to low IgG concentrations and depression of T cell function3.",

Plasma exchange (PLEX) has a clear indication in anti-GBM disease and although the PEXIVAS trial failed to show long-term benefit of PLEX in AAV, it may be useful in the short term to mitigate AAV and allow reduced steroid doses5. PLEX should be performed against fresh frozen plasma, and convalescent plasma might be used at the end of the session if the patient has COVID-19.

Therapeutic drug monitoring is the standard of care to balance efficacy and safety, that is, prevention of an alloimmune response (rejection) at only a moderately increased risk of infections. As data on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-positive kidney transplant recipients are lacking, it is fair to assume that reducing maintenance immunosuppression could be key to their management. What remains unclear, however, is the degree of immunosuppressant reduction that is required to enable SARS-CoV-2 containment. Post-transplant immunosuppression, in particular with CNIs, compromises the adaptive T cell response to a much greater extent than innate immunity and thus results in an increased risk of uncontrolled viral spreading and invasion. Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of ciclosporin decreased the expression of the N protein of human coronavirus 229E; this multifunctional protein is required for viral replication8. Based on these in vitro data, it might be speculated that ciclosporin could be used as the preferred CNI during the COVID-19 pandemic. No data are available on whether tacrolimus derivatives or metabolites exhibit similar in vitro activity.",

Remdesivir was developed for the treatment of Ebola virus disease and works through blockade of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a key viral enzyme, whereas lopinavir\u2013ritonavir is an anti-HIV protease inhibitor drug combination. The first trial from Wuhan in which lopinavir\u2013ritonavir was compared with standard care reported negative results9. In the Solidarity trial lopinavir\u2013ritonavir will be tested alone or in combination with interferon-\u03b2 to control inflammation. Chloroquine and HCQ are antimalarial drugs that have been reported to exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Unusually, kidney transplant recipients are not excluded from the Solidarity trial and we hope that valid data will be available soon. Notably, some of the antiviral drugs exhibit significant drug\u2013drug interactions, especially with CNIs, and thorough monitoring of the trough levels of ciclosporin or tacrolimus will be necessary. As for all clinical decisions, the characteristics of each individual patient need to be considered when making treatment decisions for COVID-19.",

In Austria, the transplantation programme was reinitiated on 14 April 2020, but limited to kidney transplants (live and deceased donor) with low immunological risk that do not require anti-thymoglobulin or alemtuzumab induction regimens. If necessary, administration of anti-thymoglobulin for rejection or as part of the induction protocol should be minimized, given its profound effects on lymphocytes.
