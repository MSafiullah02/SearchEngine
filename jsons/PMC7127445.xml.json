More manifestations of chronic diseases commonly seen by generalists now qualify patients for SOT, including symptomatic chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), chronic hepatitis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Given the prevalence of these chronic conditions, more than 100,000 people are on waiting lists in the United States for SOTs. While wait-list length is influenced by changes in demand, listing practices, death rates, donation rates, and allocation policies, it is important to be aware that the demand for SOT is increasing (Fig. 1\n).3\n",

Reduced cellular immunity leaves hosts susceptible to viral, fungal, and intracellular pathogens while decreased humoral immunity increases the risk for encapsulated bacteria. In most SOT recipients the degree of immunosuppression, and hence the infectious risk, tends to decrease over time, but never returns to a normal baseline. For those who develop recurrent or chronic organ rejection and require intensification of their immunosuppressive regimen, the risk for infection remains high. Usual immunosuppressive regimens include a corticosteroid, a calcineurin inhibitor, and an antimetabolite.5\n",

As a result, in general more comprehensive diagnostic testing and earlier escalation to advanced imaging and invasive diagnostic procedures are warranted for SOT patients.5 Although empiric therapeutic interventions have their place in SOT patients, thorough efforts to identify and characterize the etiologic agent(s) of infection are imperative.",
