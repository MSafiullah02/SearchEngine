It also depends on the relative importance of the disease.

The disease is caused by species of Schistosoma trematode parasite, for which water-living snails are intermediate hosts. The distribution of suitable water bodies is therefore important for its distribution. However, there must also be suitable temperature: In China, Oncomelania hupensis snail intermediate hosts cannot live north of the January 0\u00b0C isotherm (the \u201cfreezing line\u201d) while Schistosoma japonicum only develops within the snail at temperatures above 15.4\u00b0C. Shistosomosis risk in China is therefore restricted to the warmer southeastern part of the country [4].Diseases transmitted by tsetse flies (sleeping sickness, animal trypanosomosis) and ticks (such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, East Coast fever, heartwater) impose a tremendous burden on African people and their livestock. Many aspects of the vectors\u2019 life cycles are sensitive to climate, to the extent that their spatial distributions can be predicted accurately using satellite-derived proxies for climate variables [5].Mosquitoes (principally Culex and Aedes) transmit several viruses of birds that can also cause mortality in humans and horses. Examples are West Nile fever (WNF) and the viral encephalitides such as Venezuelan, western, and eastern equine encephalitis (VEE, WEE, and EEE, respectively) [6]. The spatial distributions of the mosquito vectors are highly sensitive to climate variables.\n",

There are other diseases where the associations can be described as seasonal-temporal.Salmonellosis is a serious food-borne disease caused by Salmonella bacteria, most often obtained from eggs, poultry, and pork. Salmonellosis notification rates in several European countries have been shown to increase by about 5\u201310% for each 1\u00b0C increase in ambient temperature [7]. Salmonellosis notification is particularly associated with high temperatures during the week prior to consumption of infected produce, implicating a mechanistic effect via poor food handling.Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious, viral infection of cloven-footed animals, including cattle, sheep, and pigs. Most transmission is by contact between infected and susceptible animals, or by contact with contaminated animal products. However, FMD can also spread on the wind. The survival of the virus is low at relative humidity (RH) below 60% [8], and wind-borne spread is favored by the humid, cold weather common to temperate regions. In warmer drier regions, such as Africa, wind-borne spread of FMD is considered unimportant [9].Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute, contagious, viral disease of small ruminants, especially goats, which is of great economic importance in parts of Africa and the Near East. It is transmitted mostly by aerosol droplets between animals in close contact. However, the appearance of clinical PPR is often associated with the onset of the rainy season or dry cold periods [10], a pattern that may be related to viral survival. The closely related rinderpest virus survives best at low or high relative humidity, and least at 50\u201360% [11].Several directly transmitted human respiratory infections, including those caused by rhinoviruses (common colds) and seasonal influenza viruses (flu) have, in temperate countries, seasonal patterns linked to the annual temperature cycle. There may be direct influences of climate, such as the effect of humidity on survival of the virus in aerosol [12], or indirect influences via, for example, seasonal changes in the strength of the human immune system or more indoor crowding during cold weather [13].\n",

There are other diseases where the associations can be described as seasonal-interannual.Anthrax is an acute infectious disease of most warm-blooded animals, including humans, with worldwide distribution. The causative bacterium, Bacillus anthracis forms spores able to remain infective for 10\u201320 years in pasture. Temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture all affect the successful germination of anthrax spores, while heavy rainfall may stir up dormant spores. Outbreaks are often associated with alternating heavy rainfall and drought, and high temperatures [14].Cholera, a diarrheal disease which has killed tens of millions of people worldwide, is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which lives amongst sea plankton [15]. High temperatures causing an increase in algal populations often precede cholera outbreaks. Disruption to normal rainfall helps cholera to spread further, either by flooding, leading to the contamination of water sources, such as wells, or drought which can make the use of such water sources unavoidable. Contaminated water sources then become an important source of infection in people.Plague is a flea-borne disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis; the fleas\u2019 rodent hosts bring them into proximity with humans. In Central Asia, large scale fluctuations in climate synchronize the rodent population dynamics over large areas [16], allowing population density to rise over the critical threshold required for plague outbreaks to commence [17].African horse sickness (AHS), a lethal infectious disease of horses, is caused by a virus transmitted by Culicoides biting midges. Large outbreaks of AHS in the Republic of South Africa over the last 200 years are associated with the combination of drought and heavy rainfall brought by the warm phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) [18].Rift Valley Fever (RVF), an important zoonotic viral disease of sheep and cattle, is transmitted by Aedes and Culex mosquitoes. Epizootics of RVF are associated with periods of heavy rainfall and flooding [19\u201321] or, in East Africa, with the combination of heavy rainfall following drought associated with ENSO [20, 22]. ENSO-related floods in 1998, following drought in 1997, led to an epidemic of RVF (and some other diseases) in the Kenya/Somalia border area and the deaths of more than 2000 people and two-thirds of all small ruminant livestock [23]. Outbreaks of several other human infections, including malaria and dengue fever have, in some parts of the world, been linked to ENSO events.\n",

Disease severity is therefore directly correlated with the number of parasites acquired at the point of infection or subsequently, and in turn this is frequently associated with climate, which affects both parasite survival and seasonal occurrence.Fasciolosis, caused by the Fasciola trematode fluke, is of economic importance to livestock producers in many parts of the world and also causes disease in humans. In sheep, severe pathology, including sudden death, results from acute fasciolosis which occurs after ingestion of more than 2,000 metacercariae (larval flukes) of Fasciola hepatica at pasture, while milder pathology associated with subacute and chronic fasciolosis occurs after ingestion of 200\u20131,000 metacercariae [24]. Acute fasciolosis is therefore most common in places or in years when rainfall and temperature favor the survival of large numbers of metacercariae.\nNematodirus battus is a nematode parasite of the intestine of lambs. Eggs deposited in the feces of one season\u2019s lambs do not hatch straightaway; instead, they build up on the pasture during summer and remain as eggs over winter, not hatching until temperatures the following spring exceed 10\u00b0C [25]. Once the mean daily temperature exceeds this threshold the eggs hatch rapidly, leading to a sharp peak in the number of infective larvae on the pasture. If this coincides with the new season\u2019s lambs grazing on the pasture, there is likely to be a large uptake of larvae and severe disease, called nematodiriasis. If, however, there is a warm spell early in the year, the peak in larvae on pasture may occur while lambs are still suckling rather than grazing, such that fewer larvae are ingested and the severity of nematodiriasis is reduced.\n",

Some human populations and many animal species have evolved a level of genetic resistance to some of the diseases to which they are commonly exposed. Malaria presents a classic example for humans, with a degree of resistance to infection in African populations obtained from heterozygosity for the sickle-cell genetic trait. Considering animals, wild mammals in Africa may be infected with trypanosomes, but rarely show signs of disease; local Zebu cattle breeds, which have been in the continent for millennia, show some degree of trypanotolerance (resistance to disease caused by trypanosome infection); by contrast, recently introduced European cattle breeds are highly susceptible to trypanosomosis. In stark contrast, African mammals proved highly susceptible to rinderpest which swept through the continent in the late nineteenth century, and which they had not previously encountered. It seems unlikely that climate change will directly affect genetic or immunologic resistance to disease in humans or animals. However, significant shifts in disease distributions driven by climate change pose a greater threat than simply the exposure of new populations.

Counter-intuitively, as endemically stable infections become rarer, a higher proportion of cases are in older individuals (it takes longer, on average, to acquire infection) and the number of cases of severe disease rises. Certain tick-borne diseases of livestock in Africa, such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and cowdriosis, show a degree of endemic stability [56], and it has been proposed to occur for some human diseases like malaria [57].

By contrast, biting midges, brachyceran flies (e.g., tabanids, muscids, myiasis flies, hippoboscids), ticks, and mosquitoes (and, in Africa, tsetse) all dominate as vectors of livestock disease.

In addition to this effect on vector competence, an increase in temperature may alter the balance between the lifespan of an infected vector, its frequency of feeding, and the time necessary for the maturation of the pathogen within it. This balance is critical, as a key component of the risk of transmission of a vector-borne disease is the number of blood meals taken by a vector between the time it becomes infectious and its death [65]. Accordingly, rising ambient temperature can increase the risk of pathogen transmission by shortening the time until infectiousness in the vector and increasing its feeding frequency at a faster rate than it shortens the vector\u2019s lifespan, such that the number of feeds taken by an infectious vector increases. However, at even higher temperatures this can reverse [66] such that the number of infectious feeds then decreases relative to that possible at lower temperatures. This point is extremely important, as it means that the risk of transmission of vector-borne pathogens does not uniformly increase with rising temperature, but that it can become too hot and transmission rates decrease. This effect will be most important for short-lived vectors such as biting midges and mosquitoes [30].",

All of these can alter the chances of an infected human or animal coming into contact with a susceptible one. For example, a series of droughts in East Africa between 1993 and 1997 resulted in pastoral communities moving their cattle to graze in areas normally reserved for wildlife. This resulted in cattle infected with a mild lineage of rinderpest transmitting disease both to other cattle and to susceptible wildlife, causing severe disease, for example, in buffalo, lesser kudu, and impala, and devastating certain populations [73].",

This effect is particularly acute for host-specific diseases, such as the transmissible cancer of Tasmanian devils, Sarcophilus harrisii, DFTD or Devil facial tumor disease (discussed in [81]); at low host population sizes, DFTD may become extinct. By contrast, diseases with a broad host range may threaten individual species down to the last individual. As anthrax has both a broad host range and can lie dormant in the environment, it is a particular threat for species with very low numbers, and is currently a conservation consideration for many species.

For example, warming of the Pacific in the range of the oyster Crassostrea virginica caused range expansion of the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus probably due to a combination of increased overwinter survival, greater summer proliferation, and increased host density [91].

The tropics have the most species in imminent danger of extinction [93] while tropical coral reefs comprise much of the biodiversity of the oceans.

The importance of climate in Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis epidemiology, the cause of chytridiomycosis, and numerous amphibian extinctions is fiercely debated. Although the pathogen B. dendrobatidis is neither vector-borne nor has a prolonged environmental phase, it is affected by temperature because the environment of its ectothermic hosts is not kept constant when external temperature varies. It belongs to a basal group within the fungi and has a brief motile zoospore stage for dispersal, followed by the penetration of the outer layers of amphibian skin and asexual intracellular multiplication [97]. Its growth is limited by warmer temperatures, perhaps because amphibians shed their outer layers of skin more frequently in warmer temperatures [97]. Pounds et al. [98] were the first to make a connection between climate and B. dendrobatidis-mediated amphibian extinctions, reporting spatiotemporal associations between warming and last year of detection of frog species. The development rate of the B. dendrobatidis fungus depends on summer temperature [99], and its survival is dependent on winter freezing [100]. The fungus appears to cause more mortality in mountainous regions [101], yet may be limited at the upper extremes of altitude. Climate may also affect the impact of the disease due to host factors. The habitat of the golden toad Bufo periglenes in 1987, the last year of its existence, was much reduced due to an especially dry summer. This may have caused crowded conditions in the remaining ponds, facilitating the spread of chytridiomycosis [102].",

This was first detected in the Balkans where bluetongue occurred but no C. imicola could be found [108].

In this model, temporal variation in transmission risk is derived from the influence of climate (mainly temperature and rainfall) on the abundance of the vector species, and from the influence of temperature alone on the ability of the vectors to transmit the causative virus. As described earlier, this arises from the balance between vector longevity, vector feeding frequency, and the time required for the vector to become infectious. Spatial variation in transmission risk is derived from these same climate-driven influences and, additionally, differing densities of sheep and cattle. This integrated model successfully reproduces many aspects of bluetongue\u2019s distribution and occurrence, both past and present, in Western Europe, including its emergence in northwest Europe in 2006. The model gives this specific year the highest positive anomaly (relative to the long-term average) for the risk of bluetongue transmission since at least 1960, but suggests that other years were also at much higher-than-average risk. The model suggests that the risk of bluetongue transmission increased rapidly in southern Europe in the 1980s and in northern Europe in the 1990s and 2000s.",

Malaria has moved from being climate sensitive (an increasing relationship between ambient temperature and the extent of malaria transmission) in the days before disease interventions were widely available to a situation today where regions with malaria transmission are warmer than those without, but within the malaria-affected region, warmer temperatures no longer mean more disease transmission. Instead, other variables affecting malaria, such as good housing, the running of malaria control schemes, or ready access to affordable prophylaxis, now play a greater role than temperature in determining whether there are higher or lower amounts of transmission. This would suggest that the importance of climate change in discussions of future patterns of malaria transmission is likely to have been significantly overplayed.",

Hence, while the spatial distribution of higher versus lower degrees of malaria transmission appears to have become, in a sense, divorced from ambient temperature, it seems likely that the weather plays as important a role as ever in determining when seasonal transmission will start and end. Climate change may therefore still have a role to play in malaria: not so much affecting where it occurs but, via changing rainfall patterns and mosquito numbers, when or for how long people are most at risk.",

It is less than 40 years since malaria was eradicated in Europe and the United States; and the 15\u00b0C July isotherm was the northern limit until the mid nineteenth century [119]. Changes in land use and increased living standards, in particular, acted to reduce exposure to the mosquito vector in these temperate zones, leading ultimately to the final removal of the disease. In the UK, a proportion of the reduction has been attributed to increasing cattle numbers and the removal of marshland [120]. In Finland, changes in family size, improvements in housing, changes in farming practices, and the movement of farmsteads out of villages lead to the disappearance of malaria [121], where it had formerly been transmitted indoors in winter. While future increases in temperature may, theoretically, lead to an increased risk of malaria transmission in colder climes than at present [120, 122], the much-altered physical and natural environment may preclude this risk increasing to a level that merits concern. Once again, a more important future driver of malaria risk, in the UK at least, may be the pressure to return some of our landscape to its former state, such as the reflooding of previously drained marshland.",

Theoretically, increased dryness could lead to a declining risk of certain diseases. A good example is fasciolosis, where the lymnaeid snail hosts of the Fasciola trematode are particularly dependent on moisture. Less summer rainfall and reduced soil moisture may reduce the permissiveness of some parts of the UK for this disease.

Why are these two diseases, both vector-borne and subject to the similar epidemiological processes and temperature dependencies, so different with respect to climate change? The answer lies in the relative importance of other disease drivers. For bluetongue, it is difficult to envisage epidemiologically relevant drivers of disease transmission, other than climate, that have changed significantly over the time period of the disease\u2019s emergence [64]. Life on the farm for the midges that spread bluetongue is probably not dramatically different today from the life they enjoyed 30 years ago.
