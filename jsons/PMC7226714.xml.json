            "text": "In resource-limited settings with a high tuberculosis prevalence, almost half of patients are treated empirically with anti-tuberculosis drugs upon clinical suspicion only [1\u20133]. Besides lack of available tests, this is mainly due to the poor sensitivity of microbiological tests, especially in patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or in those with suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis [4, 5]. The decision to treat tuberculosis based on clinical signs and symptoms only has a low accuracy for culture-confirmed tuberculosis, and 30\u201360% of these decisions lead to false treatment [1, 3, 6]. The consequence is, that patients are unnecessarily exposed to potentially toxic drugs for long time periods, and the diagnosis of their real disease such as other infections, cancer or heart failure is delayed, or missed. Additional diagnostic methods are therefore needed to distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases with similar symptoms.",

            "text": "Ultrasound is a widely available diagnostic tool, which is used in various medical fields. Focused Assessment with Sonography for HIV and Tuberculosis (FASH) is a useful tool to detect signs of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, namely pleural and pericardial effusion, enlarged abdominal lymph nodes, hypoechogenic lesions in the spleen and the liver, ascites and thickening of the bowel wall [7]. FASH can be performed as a point of care bedside test and can be taught to personnel with little or no previous experience in ultrasonography [8]. In our observational study from rural Tanzania including 191 HIV-positive and -negative patients with suspected pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, abnormal chest X-ray, presence of \u22651 FASH-sign, and elevated body temperature were independently associated with confirmed tuberculosis. A combination of \u22651 FASH sign, abnormal chest X-ray, and temperature \u2265 37.5 \u00b0C had a high (99.1%) sensitivity but a low (35.2%) specificity for confirmed tuberculosis. We concluded that ultrasound might be useful to exclude tuberculosis, in combination with other tests [9]. In a recent Cochrane metanalysis including HIV-positive adults, FASH signs predicted tuberculosis with a moderate diagnostic performance only. The authors also concluded that ultrasound results should be considered in combination with other tests, such as chest X-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF\u00ae only [10]. No randomized controlled trial evaluating sonography for the diagnosis of tuberculosis has been done yet.",

Microbiological analyses are performed as follows: If a patient can produce sputum, conventional Xpert MTB/RIF\u00ae (Cefeid, Sunnyvale, CA) is done. We decided to use the conventional Xpert in sputum because the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra\u00ae assay has a lower specificity in sputum, and might generate false positive results [14]. Additionally, sputum samples are sent for solid culture after adding cetylpyridinium chloride and N-acetyl-l-cysteine-sodium hydroxide and are then inoculated on L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen medium [15]. For all patients, urine samples are collected and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra\u00ae assay is used [16, 17].",

Clinical symptoms can be sensitive, but not specific for tuberculosis [27]. Moreover, in HIV positive people on antiretroviral therapy, the absence of cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss does not exclude tuberculosis, because of the low sensitivity of these symptoms in this group of patients [28]. Microbiological testing as the gold-standard remains challenging, with severely ill patients and patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis who are often unable to expectorate sputum. Invasive sampling to acquire material for microbiology is mostly not available [29]. Furthermore, a strategy relying on spontaneously expectorated sputum is inadequate in about one third of tuberculosis cases [30]. Moreover, patients with tuberculosis and HIV often have low bacillary loads in sputum and other body cavity fluids, which reduces further the sensitivity of culture and Xpert MTB/RIF\u00ae assay [31]. Therefore, patients are often empirically treated despite negative microbiological tests [6]. Overtreatment of patients who do not have tuberculosis generates unnecessary costs, exposes patients to potentially toxic drugs, and might delay the diagnosis of the real cause of the disease. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to assess whether sonography, combined with chest X-ray and established microbiological tests, can increase the proportion of correctly managed patients with clinically suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis.",

Second, the study is not blinded. However, results will reflect real life scenarios. Third, according to our experience in the observational study [9], loss to follow-up is a frequent challenge especially in the rural setting. We have attempted to address this through increasing our sample size to allow for some loss to follow-up. Fourth, this study is done in an environment with high tuberculosis prevalence, and findings cannot be transferred to low prevalence settings.",
