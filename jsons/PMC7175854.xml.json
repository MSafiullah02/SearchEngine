Some, though not all states, require staff to be trained in infection control. Though the level of detail in the regulation text varies, a total of 32 total states list or describe infection control as a training component (Table 1). Ten states include language surrounding epidemics, primarily regarding reportable disease and requirements for reporting to local Public Health departments, and 2 (MA and OR) describe pandemic emergency preparedness (Table 1). Despite current state and national responses to COVID-19 in long-term care settings including the exclusion of nonessential visitors, only 6 states (CO, IL, IN, KS, MA and ND) directly reference general resident isolation practices for communicable diseases within their infection control policies.",

In addition, we identified 13 states (CO, GA, IA, IN, MA, ND, NH, NJ, SD, UT, VA, WA, WI) that require more robust policies and procedures, operationalized via an infection control program. For example, in New Hampshire, an appointed individual is tasked with developing both an infection control program and educational plan (N.H. Admin. Rules, He-P 804.22). Washington's AL administrative rules for \u201cinfection control\u201d (WAC 388-78A-2610) includes 5 components: a system to identify and manage infections, staff-specific policies, provision of supplies (eg, protective clothing), current infection control standards, and reporting requirements.",

There is potential for RC/AL communities to have confusion during epidemics/pandemics in translating these regulations into practice without adequate support and resources. In addition, the sociocultural model of AL emphasizes a homelike, noninstitutional setting and practices. This model, associated with resident quality of life, can conflict with standard clinical and public health practices in hospitals in nursing homes, such as wearing medical products (eg, gloves, respirators, scrubs).7\n,\n8 Therefore, RC/AL communities may face tension in providing an environment synonymous with the sociocultural model of RC/AL, while ensuring resident safety during outbreaks. The effect of varying infection control regulations on RC/AL communities\u2019 practices and ultimately residents is unknown; however, these relationships will be an area of focus as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop and adversely impacts older adults residing in these settings.",
