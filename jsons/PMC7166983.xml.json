In a study targeting older adults hospitalized with influenza, cough was the most common symptom, followed by fever.15 These results are consistent with those from our study. The seasonal pattern of influenza observed in our study was similar to the results previously reported in South China16 and the recent ILI surveillance results in Shanghai.17 In addition to ILI,18 elderly patients with influenza were more likely to develop sore throat, shortness of breath, fatigue, and headache. A(H3N2) was the most frequently detected strain in the patients with influenza enrolled in our study. A(H3N2) was the predominant local influenza subtype between 2012 and 2013,17 and this result might be affected by the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in China. A recent study showed that the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) was lower than that against the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain over those years.19\n",

Second, sampling bias might be caused due on convenience sampling method. Beside, although some inpatients were excluded because they previously visited outpatient clinics, the bias caused by repeated visits remains in our study, especially among inpatients.
