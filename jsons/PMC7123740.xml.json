These mechanisms will be further modified not only by the severity of the inciting event but also by preexisting susceptibilities including baseline cardiac and kidney function and presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Among patients reperfused following AMI, those developing AKI tended to have higher plasma norepinephrine, B-natriuretic peptide, and interleukin-6 levels in the 2 weeks after reperfusion compared to those without AKI. Those with AKI show higher risk of in-hospital death and major adverse cardiac events, including greater changes in LV remodeling during recovery. Even small acute changes in serum creatinine modify the risk of death following AMI [6]. Among those developing AKI, greater risk of cardiovascular events such as congestive heart failure (CHF), recurrent AMI, and stroke and need for rehospitalization have been shown [6]. Moreover, patients with AMI complicated by AKI have increased risk of development of incident CKD and accelerated progression to ESKD [7].",

While AKI is most often attributable to the administration of radiocontrast media, additional susceptibilities and confounding factors in the population undergoing the procedure are also likely to be contributory (i.e., atheroembolic disease, kidney hypoperfusion, concomitant nephrotoxins). The reported incidence is highly variable depending on the population at risk being evaluated and the type of procedure performed (i.e., emergent, intravascular, type, and volume of contrast media). The natural history of CI-AKI in many patients may follow an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine with early return to baseline, and these patients would not be expected to fulfill the criteria for type III CRS. However, in an estimated 0.2\u20131.1 %, AKI progresses to require the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) [9, 10].",

            "text": "The loss of metabolic/fluid homeostasis and excretory function characteristic of AKI is associated with the retention of metabolic waste products (i.e., uremic toxins), nonvolatile acids, and the expansion of extracellular volume. This decrement in kidney function can precipitate clinically important and adverse physiological consequences on the normal function of numerous organ systems, in particular the lung [1]. The accumulation of uremic compounds is known to contribute to lung inflammation and injury and has been termed uremic pneumonitis. However, this complication of AKI is rarely seen due to earlier initiation and more intensive application of RRT [11]. Metabolic derangement in AKI, such as abnormalities in serum phosphate and calcium level and metabolic acidosis, may also contribute to respiratory muscle weakness and dysfunction [12]. Perhaps the most common life-threatening pulmonary complication associated with AKI is alveolar edema. Expansion of extracellular volume can contribute to increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. This coupled with alterations to pulmonary microvascular permeability and reduced serum oncotic pressure can predispose to rapid increases in extravascular lung water [13]. AKI can also contribute to lowering the threshold for accumulation of extravascular lung water [14] along with impaired clearance of alveolar fluid once present. Indeed, lung injury in AKI can occur in the absence of overt volume overload [15]. This is due, in part, to the downregulation of epithelial sodium transporters (ENaC), sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatases (Na-K-ATPase), and aquaporins at the alveolar-capillary barrier. In further support of the hypothesis that lung injury in AKI represents more than alveolar edema, experimental models of ischemic-/reperfusion-induced AKI have shown lung injury that is characterized by not only pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema but also focal alveolar hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltrate [16]. Indeed, the systemic inflammation incited by AKI, including the release and reduced clearance of proinflammatory mediators, is an important mechanism contributing to acute lung injury. Moreover, the magnitude of AKI, both in terms of severity and duration, can also modify the intensity of lung injury.",

Among patients receiving mechanical ventilation, the development of AKI has been associated with impaired or delayed weaning, higher likelihood of tracheostomy, and prolongation of ICU stay [17].

These patients often receive supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilatory support, or invasive mechanical ventilation when respiratory failure ensues, with the aim of correcting hypoxemia and restoring near-normal gas exchange. However, this is often challenging or not possible, and many patients may have residual hypoxemia or hypercapnea in the setting of ARDS and lung-protective ventilation and/or permission hypercapnea. The exact mechanisms by which hypoxemia contributes to AKI are incompletely understood and, however, are likely multifactorial and relate to altered cardiovascular function, renal microcirculatory dysfunction, neuro-hormonal activation, and circulating systemic inflammatory mediators [20]. Small clinical studies have suggested that hypoxemia may impair renal autoregulation and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and contribute to sodium and water retention, while reversal of hypoxemia may improve renal blood flow (RBF) [21, 22]. Hypercapnea has also been associated with impaired kidney function, attributed to alterations in RBF and renovascular resistance; however, experimental data have been inconsistent [23]. Further, acute hypercapnea can also contribute to or worsen existing acidemia. The combined impact of hypoxemia and hypercapnea may act synergistically to impair kidney function [24].",

Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is attributable to the use of excessive end-inspiratory pressures and volumes coupled with the added effects of barotrauma, atelect-trauma, and biotrauma (Table 6.3). The mechanical disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier from excessive pressure-volume loading during positive pressure ventilation can induce the release of local inflammatory mediators into the systemic circulation [25]. This inflammation due to VILI can contribute to downstream end-organ injury, including AKI [26]. In a murine model of lung injury, the application of injurious MV was associated with increased expression of IL-6 in kidney tissue, increased evidence of renal tubular apoptosis, and impaired kidney function [27, 28].\n",

IAP is normally between 5 and 7 mmHg in healthy individuals and \u226410 mmHg in critically ill adults, measured supine at end-expiration, zeroed at the level where the midaxillary line crosses the iliac crest [30]. By consensus, intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is defined as a sustained increase in IAP \u226512 mmHg, and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) as a sustained increase >20 mmHg with new organ dysfunction/failure [30]. The most important risk factors for these conditions are shock/hypotension, resuscitation with a large amount of fluids, and worsening respiratory status [31]. Therefore, it should not be surprising that IAH is common among critically ill patients and associated with worse outcome [32]. However, it is less clear whether the relationship between IAH and organ dysfunction represents cause and effect and if prevention/treatment of IAH might improve organ function and prognosis.",

            "text": "Elevated IAP influences renal function in different ways. First, IAH might lead to a significant decrease in RBF as renal perfusion pressure equals mean arterial pressure minus IAP [33]. Further, higher intrarenal vascular resistance (organ compression) shunts blood away from the kidneys. This is of particular concern for the renal medulla, which receives only ~12 % of the RBF, exacerbated by neurohumoral activation [34]. Indeed, AKI through ischemic tubular necrosis is probably the most common complication in the ICU necessitating RRT. Second, the combination of systemic venous congestion and elevated IAP decreases the glomerular filtration gradient [35]. Because the kidney is an encapsulated organ, a pressure rise in the venous system translates into a higher renal interstitial and Bowman\u2019s capsular pressure, directly impeding glomerular filtration [36, 37]. Intriguingly, in advanced heart failure \u2013 presumably because of low renal perfusion \u2013 the kidneys are extremely sensitive to even small elevations in IAP (8\u201310 mmHg) [38]. Moreover, decreasing IAP in such cases, through ultrafiltration or paracentesis, can dramatically improve renal function [38]. Extrapolating these findings to the general ICU population, recent evidence suggests that a comprehensive management strategy with appropriate use of an open abdomen in patients at risk significantly improves survival from IAH/ACS [39].",

Mortality increases as serum sodium falls, increasing as serum sodium falls from <130 to <120 mmol/L from 11 to 25 % [50]. Vasopressin release from the hypothalamus, termed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release (SIADH) and leads to water retention by the kidney, is the most common cause of hyponatremia (60\u201370 %), but cerebral salt wasting, now termed nephrogenic sodium wasting (NSW), may also develop (6\u201310 %). Both conditions cause hyponatremia, and although physical examination may help to discriminate between these conditions, with SIADH patients typically being euvolemic [51] and those with NSW having signs of extracellular volume depletion, in clinical practice, it may be difficult to distinguish between these conditions and, in a small proportion of cases, both conditions may be present (5 %). Similarly biochemical investigation may also be unhelpful as both conditions will have a reduced serum osmolality (<285 mOsmo/kg), with a relatively increased urinary sodium (>25 mmol/l) and urinary osmolality (>200 mOsmo/kg) (Fig. 6.1). However, patients with NSW should have increased urea, creatinine, and hematocrit due to intravascular volume depletion, whereas they should be normal or lowered in SIADH due to relative water retention [52]. In both conditions serum urate is typically reduced. It is important to make the correct diagnosis as instituting the standard treatment for SIADH, namely, water restriction and a vasopressin receptor antagonist, can lead to permanent ischemic cerebral damage and mortality in patients with NSW, who require a controlled increase in serum sodium, approximately 8 mmol/day, using hypertonic saline in combination with fludrocortisone [53].\n",

In addition, kidney failure leads to the accumulation of the waste products of nitrogen metabolism, with organic acids accumulating in the brain, resulting in changes in both neuronal intracellular osmolality and neurotransmitter levels [57].

This is exacerbated by downregulation of key fluid transport molecules in the alveoli, alterations to microvascular permeability, and reduced serum oncotic pressure, which further lower the threshold for alveolar edema and impair alveolar fluid clearance.Mechanical ventilation, through alterations in intrathoracic pressures and systemic hemodynamics and through exacerbation of lung injury, can contribute to AKI and negatively impact kidney function.\nThe Kidney and the Abdominal CompartmentNormal IAP is \u226410 mmHg in critically ill patients.IAH (sustained IAP >12 mmHg) is frequently associated with AKI through multiple pathways (fluid overload, low perfusion, neurohumoral).Elevated IAP is considered an important contributor in patients with congestive heart failure and worsening kidney function, and this is termed CARS.Gut microbiota and toxins may play a role in the development of AKI and form an area for future research.Hepatorenal syndrome needs to be considered in patients with cirrhosis and worsening kidney function.\nThe Kidney and the BrainNephrogenic sodium wasting is a potential cause of hyponatremia in patients with acute brain injury and infections and must not be confused with SIADH.Cranial diabetes insipidus may develop acutely following acute brain injury and pituitary surgery, causing hypernatremia.Renal transplant patients are at increased risk of drug-induced encephalopathy and psychotic reactions during the first weeks post transplantation.In the longer-term renal transplant, patients are immunocompromised and remain at risk of cerebral infections.\n",
