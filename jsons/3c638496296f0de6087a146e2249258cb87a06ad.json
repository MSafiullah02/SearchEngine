Algorithm decomposes original sequence into set of distinct subsequences -a patterns. The set of subsequences common for two symbolic sequences (their intersection) is proposed as a measure of similarity between them. The new similarity measure works well for short (of tens letters) sequences and the very long (of hundred thousand letters) as well. When applied to nucleotide or protein sequences may help to trace possible evolutionary of species. As an illustration, similarity of several sets of nucleotide and amino acid sequences is examined.",

The aim of sequence comparison is to discover similarity relationships between various biological sequences. DNA or proteins can be similar with respect to their sequence of nucleic bases or amino acids . It is belived that high sequence similarity usually implies strong functional or structural similarity. A similarity measure provides a quantitative answer to question whether two sequences show a certain degree of similarity. The distance between two sequences is often used as a numerical measure of how dissimilar the sequences are. The similarity measure is dual to the dissimilarity of the sequences. Lower value of distance means greater similarity. It can also be very usufull to know where the two sequences are similar, and where they differ. An alignment showes similar region (subsequences) between two sequences.",

            "text": "There are numerous measures of similarity between symbolic sequences based on different distance measures between sequence of bases in the gene, or between some structural sequence invariants. The first group of algorithms essentially consists of plotting a point in 4 (or 2)-dimensional space corresponding to a base by moving one unit in a direction associated with the base. The cumulative plot of such points produces a graph that corresponds to the sequence of bases in the gene fragment under consideration. The measure of dissimilarity between two sequences is the Euclidean distance between the end points of the graph. This method has some disadvantages, first of all, the sequences may have different length, second, there is generally no fixed correspondence between their character positions and third, the computational complexity. An alternative to code sequence comparison is Randi\u0107 [5] approach in which sequences are compared based on a set of structural sequence invariants. The idea is to represent a DNA sequence by an n-dimensional vectors or n-tuple of sequence invariants, typically resulting from a graphical representation of the DNA, and use a distance function for vectors to measure the distance between them. For comparison of very long sequences, e.g. whole genomes, an approach based on the frequency of k-mers that appear in a set of sequences are used [6] . A k-mer is a series of k consecutive letters in a sequence. The approach consists of counting occurrences of k-mers in a sequence, for k typically ranging from 2 to 8, and apply different statistical methods to k-mer distribution. However when the primary sequence is condensed into invariants or k-mers there is a loss of information on some aspects of the sequence.",
