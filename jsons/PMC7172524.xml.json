However, primer and/or probe sequences for detection of Flu B, RSV, PIV2, PIV3, PIV4, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and HCoV OC43 required some adjustment. The RSV assay, that detects both RSV-A and RSV-B, consisted of two sense primers, one antisense primer and two probes. All sequences obtained from RSV positive clinical isolates from 2013 contained a mismatch to both probe sequences. This mismatch was also observed in two sequences from GenBank (both from The Netherlands, 2012) but not in other L gene sequences from GenBank. Validation of adapted RSV probes was ongoing at the moment that a RSV RT-PCR negative sample resulted in a RSV positive culture. The cultured RSV strain was negative in the diagnostic RT-PCR, but positive in the updated RSV RT-PCR that was validated at that moment. However, the relative fluorescent unit (RFU) signal of the RSV strain was lower than that of positive control material and sequence analysis of the strain showed a mismatch with the new probe. This additional mismatch was not observed in sequences obtained from GenBank, but in January and February 2014 several clinical samples tested in our setting showed RSV signals with low RFU and turned out to have the same mismatch. Therefore, a new update of the RSV RT-PCR was started. Another target of the RT-PCR was considered, but alignment of over 100 whole genomes of RSV showed that the current target region in the L gene remained the target of choice. The two relatively short taqman probes were replaced by a longer taqman probe that should be able to better tolerate mismatches. The new RSV assay will be used next RSV season.",
