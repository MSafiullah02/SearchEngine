As to tackle the current 1.33 billion population of India, it seems to be inadequate if outbreak enters in phase 3 of pandemic that is community transmission. Even affordability and approachability of diagnostic facility is a big question in current scenario. The supply of equipments such as Real Time PCR and required reagents has to be maintained to keep pace with COVID-19 outbreak. The current medical education system especially post-graduation in laboratory sciences must incorporate training and competency in Real Time PCR and molecular diagnostic techniques in curriculum to combat future outbreak.",
