Patients 80 years or above acutely admitted over a six months period to an ICU between May 2018 and May 2019 were included. In addition to common patients' characteristics and disease severity, we collected information on specific geriatric syndromes as potential predictive factors for 30-day survival, frailty (Clinical Frailty scale) with a CFS > 4 defining frail patients, cognitive impairment (informant questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly (IQCODE) with IQCODE \u2265 3.5 defining cognitive decline, and disability (measured the activity of daily life with the Katz index) with ADL \u2264 4 defining disability. A Principal Component Analysis to identify co-linearity between geriatric syndromes was performed and from this a multivariable model was built with all geriatric information or only one: CFS, IQCODE or ADL. Akaike's information criterion across imputations was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of our models.",

In the past decade this has been identified as a potential health challenge because these patients aged 80 and above consume a disproportionally large part of the health care budget, while the mortality rates are consistently reported to be higher than in younger patients [2] . However, it is important to separate unplanned from planned ICU admissions, since the latter group has a much better outcome [3] . In unplanned admissions the overall 30-day mortality of ICU patients is approximately 40% [4] . Long-term mortality (6 months or 12 months) is most often 50% or above [5] . This high mortality translates into suffering in patients and relatives and moral distress in care-givers. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to better identify elderly patients with an expected good outcome including a post discharge acceptable quality of life.",

Institutional research ethic board approval was obtained from each study site. Five countries were allowed to recruit patients without prior written informed consent while others had to collect informed consent from patient or their legal representative [9] . Individual ICUs were asked to include consecutive patients for a 6-month period in the 1-year study period and were allowed to stop after 20 included patients. All patients were followed until 30 days after ICU admission. A dedicated web site (www.VIP2s tudy. com) was set up to facilitate information about the study and study progress and to allow for data entry using an electronic case record form CRF (supplemental 1).

            "text": "We confirmed that 30-day survival is very low (61.2%) in unselected patients 80 years or older who are acutely admitted to the ICU. Age-related symptoms as frailty, cognitive decline and disability were strongly associated with 30-day mortality and were more important than age alone. Comorbidity and polypharmacy, however, had no predictive value when measured as the CPS. Interestingly, the addition of cognitive impairment and disability to the prognostic analysis did not increase prognostic value compared with the model with frailty alone. The CFS was reported in 99.5% of the cases and the interrater reproducibility was very good confirming that this tool is robust and easy to use. In a previous prospective study in Europe, frailty was found to be present in 46% of acute admitted elderly ICU patients [4] and was closely related to both ICU and 30-day mortality. In the present study, frailty remained independently associated with both ICU and 30 days mortality, and this strengthens its importance in pre-ICU assessment. Frailty affects several important body functions like the endocrine system, brain, muscular and immune function, all very important in the ICU context, and was recently discussed in a clinical review [22] . The link between frailty and health-related quality of life was documented in a prospective Canadian study [23] . Frail patients were found to report reduced quality of life both in the physical and mental subset of EuroQol Health Questionnaire and in the SF-12. The use of the CFS has probably expanded lately, and different acute care settings find it useful to evaluate elderly patients in such a quick manner, even without patient contribution [24] [25] [26] , making it of particular interest in the unresponsive or unconscious patient. There is also an emerging line of research trying to link frailty with delirium. Future studies are required to investigate the possible link between these two factors on ICU survival [27] . Cognitive decline has been found to affect mortality in many clinical settings [28, 29] and several methods are used to diagnose and assess the severity of cognitive decline and dementia. Most of these tests require active patient involvement and are, for obvious reasons, not applicable to patients who are acutely admitted to the ICU. Hence, we must rely on information from someone close to the patient in order to approach cognitive function if there is no clear evidence from patient records. The IQCODE was developed as a response to such demand [30] and has been used frequently as a simple screening tool based on information from caregivers. The IQCODE has been analyzed in a Cochrane review with regard to its accuracy in finding patients with dementia [13] . A threshold of 3.3 had 0.83 sensitivity and 0.80 specificity while a threshold of 3.5 had 0.82 sensitivity and 0.84 specificity. Studies where IQCODE has been applied prior to ICU admission are scarce. An early study of IQCODE compared with Modified Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (MBDRS) was performed in 130 ICU patients \u2265 65 years [31] . They found that an IQCODE > 3.3 was present in 31% of their patients. Using the same threshold, we found 44% having an IQCODE > 3.3, and the higher percentage probably mirrors the older age group in our study. With a threshold of 3.5; the prevalence of cognitive impairment was 30.2%. In a more recent study from Spain, ICU patients were prospectively studied with data on cognition (IQCODE), activity of daily life, comorbidity and a full geriatric assessment in addition to disease severity scores [32] . They found parameters related to quality of life and functional status to be independently correlated with mortality, but not cognitive decline. However, most of their patients had IQCODE values within the normal range. Although IQCODE did not increase the predictive value when added to frailty, it was shown to have impact on 30-day outcome. It is possible that other more specific measures on cognitive decline would have performed better, but such may be difficult to implement in an acute setting. Even the IQCODE proved the most difficult measure to obtain in our cohort with 24% missing data. The CPS score is a simple score, which measures the impact of comorbidity by adding the number of comorbidities to the number of daily drugs [33] . Different thresholds have been used, but often a CPS score of < 8 has been considered to be categorized as minor, 8-14 as moderate and \u2265 15 as major comorbidity. In our cohort the median CPS value was 10, and 22% had a CPS \u2265 15. We have not found data from its previous use in ICU patients, but using the CPS in geriatric trauma (age \u2265 65 years), the investigators found CPS to predict mortality better than the more traditional Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [34] . Other studies have found the CPS to predict hospital mortality and readmissions [35, 36] and to predict in hospital complications in older burn patients [37] . However, in our study this score had no impact on outcome prediction.",

Such knowledge could support the important clinical decision of pre-ICU triage: Will this patient benefit from being admitted to the ICU? [21] . Despite associations between the geriatric syndromes and outcome, we will probably not be able to answer this important question just by using evaluation tools and measurement. Often the patient is admitted to the ICU in order to observe response to initial treatment. Important information related to survival can also be found during the first 48-72 h in the ICU. Hence the degree of organ dysfunction and vital organ support could be highly relevant due to what frequently is called the \"in ICU triage\". Such an evaluation, formal or informal, often leads to treatment being withheld and/or withdrawn. As a matter of fact, LST limitations occurred in 34.4% of the patients. Severity (SOFA) and also frailty were independent factors predicting decision to limit LST. In the Ethicus-2 study, LST limitations were documented in 13.1%, but the patients were younger (median 70 years) and age was found to be one of the determinants for EOL decision [38] .",

If they meet each other at 90 \u00b0, they are not likely to be correlated and when they diverge and form a large angle (close to 180 \u00b0), they are negatively correlated. The length of the vector shows how much weight a specific variable has on each principal component and cardiovascular support. This indicates that in most of the cases, there is no therapeutic limitation, and the very old ICU patients in our study were given active organ support when admitted to an ICU.",

Limitation of LST is common practice in most ICUs in Europe and contributes to the observed mortality. Patients with such decision differ from other patients (Table 4 ), but excluding those patients would introduce a bias to this \"real life\" observational study. When LST limitation was included in the multivariable model, CFS still has a prognostic impact on survival. The study was conducted within 1 year. Hence, we assume that trends in time do not influence the external validity. An unforeseen limitation was a huge delay in ethical and regulatory clearance in many countries caused by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduced in all EU countries from May 2018. This made the actual recruitment period shorter for many ICUs. However, when comparing ICU with short versus long recruitment period, the patients' characteristics were very similar (see ESM 8) . The estimated percentage of included patients to the potential candidates was 71.7% (ESM 9), but patients' characteristics were different in countries with a need for informed consent compared to patients enrolled in countries with no-informed consent (ESM10). This study did not focus on pre-ICU triage, and hence we cannot exclude some selection bias, in particular given the high number of patients living in their own home prior to admission. ICU triage has been the focus of other studies [39] . There is only scarce evidence of the inter-rater variability of the CFS between the caregiver and the patient when the Fig. 2 Adjusted survival curves according to geriatric symptoms: Adjusted survival curves for geriatric variables were produced using an inverse probability-weighted Kaplan-Meier estimation [19] . Variables used to adjust the curves were age, gender, place of living, reason for ICU admission and SOFA score. Significance was tested using a Cox regression model weighted by the same weights (inverse probability-weighted Cox). a Survival curves according to CFS. b Survival curves according to Katz ADL. c Survival curves according to IQCODE. d Survival curves according to CPS CFS is performed at the same time. However, one study concluded that CFS scores can be reliably assigned retrospectively [40] and another study, comparing CFS using different assessors, concluded that \"CFS scores can be generated using medical chart review and can be reliably completed by ICU clinicians and research staff\" [41] . Inter-rater was excellent in our study with a weighted kappa above 0.8. The IQCODE was missing in 24% and was based on informant data collected in a life-threatening situation suggesting that it is not a good tool for critically ill patients.",
