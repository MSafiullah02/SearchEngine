Recurrent or persistent respiratory illness can have a negative impact on health and performance of athletes undertaking high levels of strenuous exercise. The cause of upper respiratory symptoms (URS) in athletes can be uncertain but the majority of cases are related to common respiratory viruses, viral reactivation, allergic responses to aeroallergens and exercise-related trauma to the integrity of respiratory epithelial membranes. Bacterial respiratory infections are uncommon in athletes. Undiagnosed or inappropriately treated asthma and/or allergy are common findings in clinical assessments of elite athletes experiencing recurrent URS. High-performance athletes with recurrent episodes of URS should undergo a thorough clinical assessment to exclude underlying treatable conditions of respiratory inflammation. Identifying athletes at risk of recurrent URS is important in order to prescribe preventative clinical, training and lifestyle strategies. Monitoring secretion rates and falling concentrations of salivary IgA can identify athletes at risk of URS. Therapeutic interventions are limited by the uncertainty of the underlying cause of inflammation. Topical anti-inflammatory sprays can be beneficial for some athletes. Dietary supplementation with bovine colostrum, probiotics and selected antioxidants can reduce the incidence or severity of URS in some athletes.

Maintenance of the mucosal epithelium is critical to these interactions as well as acting as an exclusion barrier. The immune response at mucosal surfaces is predominantly anti-inflammatory to prevent local tissue damage. The epithelial cells produce cytokines that direct the B cells towards synthesis of IgA antibodies, which unlike IgG antibodies, has non-inflammatory interactions with antigens.

Th17 cells upregulate innate antimicrobial proteins and peptides, recruit neutrophils through chemokine activation, and promote epithelial repair. Virus-specific cytotoxic T cells can be rapidly reactivated to provide immediate responses against infections, especially EBV-infected epithelial cells. EBV establishes latency in B cells of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and viral reactivation can be stimulated in a bystander manner by environmental antigens inducing bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue reactivity. 53 The majority of studies in exercise science use salivary IgA concentration or its excretion rate to monitor the impact of exercise on mucosal protection and associations with URS.

The impact of diets enriched with carbohydrates and/or fats on immune parameters and performance have not evaluated direct associations with URS. Elite athletes can be at risk of micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the high demands of training and in the case of vitamin D from reduced UV exposure. Lowered levels of essential vitamins and minerals contribute to immune dysfunction that has the potential to place an athlete at higher risk of infection or inflammation. Only a few studies have established clear evidence for a link between URS and either baseline micronutrient status, or a positive impact of dietary supplementation in athletes (Table 2) . 70 Vitamin A (\u03b2-carotene) is essential for T-cell development and deficiencies have been associated with increased adherence of bacteria to respiratory tract epithelium and reduced IgA production. Supplementation for 3 weeks in conjunction with vitamin A in ultramarathon runners showed a small reduction in post-race URTI but was less effective than supplementation with vitamin C alone. 70 The anti-infective properties of vitamin C are thought to be mediated via induction of T lymphocyte responses, suppression of neutrophil activity and interference in viral replication through enhanced production of IFN-\u0263. Vitamin C showed no impact on the incidence of URTI in one study of marathon runners 21 but in most studies small reductions in the incidence of URS have been reported for ultramarathon runners, skiers and military recruits undertaking intensive training. 70 A consistent finding has been a reduction in severity of the symptoms when supplemented with vitamin C alone or in conjunction with other vitamins. 70 Vitamin D status is critical to effective immune modulation and antimicrobial activity. Vitamin D deficiency in endurance athletes was associated with a higher number of days with symptoms of URS and lower salivary IgA secretion rates. 71 Cytokine production from antigen-stimulated whole-blood culture was lower for TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IFN-\u0263 in vitamin D-deficient athletes, with a trend for lower IL-4 production but no associations for IL-2 or IL-10 production. Vitamin E prevents free-radical damage at membrane surfaces and is thought to stimulate both T-and B-cell proliferation. Caution is required with vitamin E supplementation in athletes, as the beneficial cell membrane protective effects were reversed in cyclists during exhaustive training. 70 Zinc inhibits lipopolysaccharide and IL-1\u03b2induced nitric oxide formation, and promotes repair of respiratory epithelium via upregulation of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases. 72 Zinc supplementation can reduce cold symptoms, cough and nasal discharge. 73 Excessive zinc however can impair T-cell proliferation and antibody formation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 207, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1113, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1500, "end": 1502, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1983, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2134, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2371, "end": 2373, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2893, "end": 2895, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 3071, "end": 3073, "text": "72", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 3148, "end": 3150, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1099, "end": 1108, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS"}, {"text": "A diet rich in antioxidants can reduce airway inflammation in asthmatics, 74 but there are no investigations examining the impact of supplementation with natural dietary antioxidants (fruit and vegetables) on URS in athletes.
