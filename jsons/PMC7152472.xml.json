In 2014, Europe was exporting around 51.5% of this share, before Asia (23.9%) and North America (20.9%). Technical textiles refer to the manufacture of a wide range of automotive products such as seatbelts, airbags, upholstery, headliners, carpets, tire reinforcements, filters, fiber-reinforced composites, thermal and acoustic insulators, etc. They are used in cars; in recreational vehicles such as motorcycles, snowmobiles, campers, and quads; in public transportation such as buses and streetcars; and in commercial vehicles such as trucks, fire trucks, ambulances, army vehicles, and construction trucks. Textile exports, when considered separately from clothing, accounted for $314 billion in 2014 (WTO, 2015).",

But even though the introduction of mandatory seatbelts and the presence of life vests under the seats have contributed to saving many lives, the presence of synthetic fabrics in airplanes has also been the cause of many deaths. According to a study led by the National Transportation Safety Board on 26 plane crashes that occurred between 1983 and 2000, among the 45% passengers who did not survive the accidents, 26% lost their lives because of the violence of the impact while almost 5% died of fire-related causes (NTSB, 2001). In addition, it was observed that, in crashes with a higher survivability rate after impact, the rate of fire-related causalities was higher. As a matter of fact, many polymers used in seats, curtains, cushions, carpets, etc. do not display a high enough flame retardancy and/or they generate toxic fumes while burning (Bertrand, 2005).",

The objective is to reduce the overall weight of the structure and cut fuel consumption. These materials also require less maintenance thanks to the larger resistance to corrosion. However, the cost of the carbon fiber raw material is still higher than steel or aluminum, for instance, despite the twofold drop over the last decade made possible by the increased production volume and the development of new manufacturing processes. Carbon fiber-reinforced composites are gaining ground and becoming competitive thanks to the reduction in defects and cycle time as well as the development of new resin systems and new fiber placement and composite manufacturing processes (Rao, Simha, Rao, & Ravi Kumar, 2015); this provides interesting perspectives for aircraft manufacturers willing to push innovation forward in this sector of industry.",

Their acceleration relative to the car depends on the speed of the vehicle prior to the impact and the accumulation of energy during the crash (Sobhani, Young, Logan, & Bahrololoom, 2011). As a complement to seatbelts, the presence of airbags is now considered as a key factor for survival during a crash. Airbags are controlled by a central unit which monitors a series of sensors, including accelerometers that can detect variations in the vehicle speed indicative of a crash. Due to the forces involved and the speed of the airbag deployment and inflation, it has to be constructed out of very high strength fabrics so that it does not explode, distort, or tear during the two most critical phases of its action: inflation and impact of the body. The airbag has thus to be designed so that it does not fail catastrophically, doesn't allow tear propagation, and includes very high safety factors.",

Lap or 2-point seat belts became compulsory in Europe for front car seats in 1965. A further improvement was the introduction of 3-point seat belts that restrain the motion of the chest toward the steering wheel or the front panel, which proved to be fatal in many cases: They are now mandatory in front and back seats of cars in many countries and are also used in a series of other road vehicles such as trucks and in the front seats of other commercial vehicles such as buses and ambulances. Lap seat belts are still found in buses and aircrafts for passenger seats.

W. Thompson, pneumatic tires take advantage of the exceptional performance of vulcanized rubber (Fung & Hardcastle, 2001). A Scottish-born veterinary surgeon, John Boyd Dunlop, rediscovered pneumatic tires at the end of the nineteenth century while trying to improve the rolling comfort of his son's tricycle. His design involved the use of a fabric as reinforcement for the rubber. Another large step was made in 1946 by Michelin, who invented the radial tire method of construction. The more stable structure it produces allows a large increase in the tire longevity, driving safety, and fuel efficiency compared to the original cross-ply construction. They now have taken over most of the passenger road vehicle market, and the use of cross-ply tires is limited to some applications for trucks, trailers, farm equipment, and emerging markets (Lindenmuth, 2006).",

The amount of textile in cross-ply tires is larger with about 21% (Fung & Hardcastle, 2001). Textiles in radial carcasses are primarily composed of polyester, while they are mostly nylon for cross-ply structures (McDonel, 2006). Aramids are also used when high strength-to-weight ratio and temperature resistance are required, for instance, in aircrafts and racing cars (Fung & Hardcastle, 2001). A small amount of aramid and nylon may be found as well in belt overlays (McDonel, 2006). Other tire components include natural and synthetic rubber, reinforcing fillers such as carbon black and silica, and various additives including vulcanization agents, plasticizers, stabilizers, antioxidants, and antiozonants (Lindenmuth, 2006).",

Further, with respect to cars, large concerns have also been raised about the air quality inside the passenger compartment (Fung & Hardcastle, 2001). Indeed, research has shown that, because of the tunnel effect, the exhaust gas concentration inside a car may be six times higher than outside. This phenomenon is amplified when a car is driven as a closed distance from the preceding one. The question of inside air filtration is also critical in public transportation, especially for long distance travel segments (Santos O'Connor, 2012).",

In the latter case, it has to slowly migrate towards the fiber surface to provide its function during use. Finishing treatments may use conventional exhaust and pad-dry-cure methods as well as newly developed padding, spraying, coating, foam finishing, and microencapsulation techniques. For instance, silver nanoparticles have recently generated interest because they appear as a more health and environmentally friendly antimicrobial alternative to halogenated phenols such as triclosan. In addition, bacteria are less prone to develop resistance to silver nanoparticles than conventional antibiotics (Chernousova & Epple, 2013). Other strategies involve the use of natural compounds such as chitosan to limit the occurrence of side effects on health and the environment (Lim & Hudson, 2004).",

They may be used directly, for instance, in filament winding or fiber placement processes. They may also be transformed into more complex textile structures such as wovens, knits, and braids with anisotropic properties in all three directions. On the other hand, nonwovens or mats are manufactured directly using fibers or chopped strands that are more or less randomly distributed in the plane of the structure. Recently, noncrimp fabrics (NCF) have been developed to combine the strength and perfect fiber placement of wovens with the flexibility, ease of manufacture, and absence of fiber crimp of nonwovens (Schnabel & Gries, 2011). The 2-D sheet materials may then be assembled by stitching, Z-pinning, or tufting, for instance, to create complex shaped, 3-D structures that will be cut to shape to be fitted in the composite part mold (Mouritz, 2011). Near net-shape preforms may also be prepared directly using 3-D textile manufacturing techniques, which include 3-D interlock and orthogonal noncrimp weaving as well as 3-D braiding. This allows improving the pace of the process and the quality of the composite. The 2-D reinforcements and 3-D preforms may also be delivered as prepregs, i.e., with the textile being coated with the resin only partially cured (Strong, 2008). Prepregs need to be stored in cold conditions to prevent premature complete polymerization.",

Indeed, the reinforcement gives the composite its strength and stiffness because it bears the stress applied on the composite part, which is transferred by the matrix. Properties measured on the reinforcement include the following:\u25cfDensity of the 1-D raw material (fiber/filament/yarn/strand/tow/roving), e.g., using Archimedes' method (ASTM D3800, 2016) or a pycnometer (ASTM D70, 2009; ASTM D5550, 2014);\u25cfElastic modulus, strength, and elongation at break of the 1-D raw material, e.g., using ASTM D4018 (2017) for continuous filament carbon and graphite fiber tows;\u25cfDry uniaxial bending of the reinforcement, e.g., based on standard test ASTM D1388 (2014) or using the apparatus developed by Jldain (2015). Buckling of inner yarns may be observed using a translucent bending surface.\u25cfDraping behavior of the reinforcement, e.g., using the double curvature technique developed by Harrabi et al. (2008);\u25cfIn-plane shear of the reinforcement using a bias extension or picture frame technique (Long, Boisse, & Robitaille, 2005). In-plane shear is considered to be the main deformation mechanism taking place when the reinforcement is formed to a 3-D geometry. This test also provides a measurement of the maximum deformation, with the yarn locking angle;\u25cfBiaxial in-plane tension of the reinforcement, e.g., using the biaxial tensile device with cruciform specimens described in Long et al. (2005). It allows characterizing the warp and weft yarn interaction in woven fabrics.\u25cfDry compaction of the reinforcement, e.g., adapted from standard test ISO 5084 (1996). The test involves the application of compression cycles and provides a measurement of the preform thickness under a certain level of normal stress as well as the through-thickness rigidity of the material. It also gives an estimate of the maximum fiber volume fraction that can be achieved (Robitaille & Gauvin, 1998);\u25cfPore size distribution in the reinforcement, e.g., using microscopy, X-ray microtomography, and capillary flow porometry (Bonnard, Causse, & Trochu, 2017). This last technique allows accessing the dual scale structure of fibrous reinforcements;\u25cfResin permeability of the reinforcement using unidirectional injection or bidirectional flow measurement from a pointwise injection gate (Demar\u00eda, Ruiz, & Trochu, 2007). The test may be conducted with 100 cp silicon oil that behaves as a Newtonian fluid.\n",

The damage may come during the manufacture of the woven or braided structure for instance as well as during use. One typical example is the cyclic fatigue experienced by a tire cord. In addition to the mechanical stress mode and conditions of application (frequency, amplitude, offset, etc.), other parameters may affect the fatigue failure of a fiber: its composition and manufacturing process/conditions, its dimensions, the presence of impurities, its environment (temperature, humidity, UV, pH, bacteria), etc. The measurement is conducted by applying cyclic loading conditions in a specified environmental. The result is expressed in terms of stress vs. number of cycles to failure (S-N) curves and survival diagrams.",
