On the one hand, individuals who already experience loneliness may be feeling even more isolated as a result of social distancing measures. However, it is also possible that COVID-19 is meaning new groups are now at risk of loneliness. The pandemic has forced millions globally to curtail face-to-face contact and social activities, cut jobs and employment opportunities, restrict travelling, and limit outdoor activity. For many individuals, this will be a radical departure from their patterns of usual daily life, and they may find habitual coping mechanisms (such as meeting with others) disrupted, leading to a heightened risk of feeling that the emotional and social support available to them is insufficient to meet their needs. Therefore, this study compared socio-demographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data captured before and during the pandemic.",
