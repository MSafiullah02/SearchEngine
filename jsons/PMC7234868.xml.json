We examined policy and programmatic implications for key humanitarian sectors\u2014including health; water, sanitation and hygiene; protection; shelter; education; food security and nutrition; and economic empowerment and well-being\u2014with the aim of offering practical, gender-sensitive recommendations for humanitarian practitioners while recognising the unique needs and capabilities of women and girls in humanitarian settings.",

Women also often perform caregiving roles outside of the home; they comprise 70% of the health and social care workforce in many countries.5 This again increases the likelihood that they will be exposed to communicable diseases. In addition, social norms prevalent in many humanitarian settings dictate that women and girls are the last to receive medical attention when they become ill.6 These norms could prevent women and girls\u2014particularly those who are already stigmatised, such as IDPs and refugees, members of certain ethnic or racial groups or those of different sexual orientations\u2014from accessing testing and timely treatment for COVID-19. Furthermore, testing may not be available for some displaced populations, as illustrated in Bangladesh, where testing facilities are limited to the capital, Dhaka, which is 400 km away from the world\u2019s largest refugee camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar.7\n",

In addition, movement restrictions and quarantine measures may result in less access to food, increasing prices at the same time that populations are less able to conduct economic activities and food production. Some households may resort to negative coping mechanisms, such as reducing food consumption, engaging in transactional sex, borrowing money or going into debt to pay for food. Surviving the declared end of an outbreak may not automatically ease food insecurity or malnutrition in affected communities, as it will likely take months to restart agricultural activities and trade.",
