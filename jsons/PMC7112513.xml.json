Dogs infected with canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) constitute the main domestic reservoir and play a central role in the transmission cycle of the parasite to humans (Deane, 1995). Therefore, a canine vaccine may be the most practical and effective method for reducing the incidence of human visceral leishmaniasis, and may also provide a basis for the development of a similar vaccine for humans (Gradoni, 2001, Hommel et al., 1995, Mauel, 2002).",

            "text": "In the search for a potential vaccine against CVL, various approaches involving the dog model have been employed, and the use of purified fractions from parasite extracts (e.g., fucose mannose ligand antigen) (Borja-Cabrera et al., 2004, da Silva et al., 2000) and from parasite cultures (excreted/secreted antigens) (Lemesre et al., 2005, Lemesre et al., 2007) have shown particular promise. Additionally, remarkable results have been obtained following vaccination of dogs with killed parasite vaccines (Giunchetti et al., 2007, Giunchetti et al., 2008a, Lasri et al., 1999, Mayrink et al., 1996, Moreira et al., 2009, Panaro et al., 2001, Vitoriano-Souza et al., 2008, Roatt et al., 2012). These vaccines represent an excellent tool for immunoprophylaxis and control of CVL, considering their wide spectrum of antigenicity, as well as their cost and safety (Giunchetti et al., 2007, Giunchetti et al., 2008a, Lasri et al., 1999, Mayrink et al., 1996, Moreira et al., 2009, Panaro et al., 2001, Vitoriano-Souza et al., 2008). Moreover, in animals that receive saponin as an adjuvant, the major adverse reaction is minor local swelling, indicating that in dogs, overall tolerance to the candidate vaccines appears to be adequate (Giunchetti et al., 2007, Giunchetti et al., 2008a, Giunchetti et al., 2008b, Moreira et al., 2009, Vitoriano-Souza et al., 2008).",

Involvement of IL-10 in the immune response of Leishmania-infected dogs has not yet been established in some organs, because expression of IL-10 mRNA is not elevated in antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the course of an experimental infection or in the bone marrow of naturally infected dogs (Quinnell et al., 2001, Santos-Gomes et al., 2002). Lage et al. (2007) suggested that severity CVL also is marked by the balanced splenic production of type 1 and 2 cytokines with the predominant accumulation of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 as a consequence of increased parasitic load and progression of the symptoms. Furthermore, Menezes-Souza et al. (2011) showed that dogs with high skin parasitism exhibited predominantly immunoregulatory pattern of immune response characterized by increased expression of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2.",

Briefly, a histological examination (morphometric analysis and leucocyte differential counting) of sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). The kinetics of cell migration was evaluated within three skin layers (outer dermis, inner dermis and hypodermis) and the predominance of cells in the inflammatory infiltrate and their distribution within the skin layers were assessed. A quantitative (morphometric) analysis of the inflammatory cells present in the skin layers was performed by acquiring digital images of pre-marked areas. Images were captured at 40 and 100\u00d7 magnification using a Leica DM5000B micro-camera (Leica Microsystems-Switzerland Ltd., Heerbrugg, Switzerland) and Leica Application Suite software (version 2.4.0 R1), and analyzed with the aid of Leica QWin (V3) software. In order to identify which types of cells were recruited to the sites of different inoculations sites, the inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) were counted and the results were expressed in percentages. Herein, correlation analysis between the cellularity and the cytokines and chemokines mRNA expression in the skin of these same animals was performed.",

The intense expression of inducible NO synthase and selective recruitment of neutrophils to the skin of animals immunized with Sap and LBSap are similar to the reactions observed in animals that exhibit resistance to Leishmania infection (Vitoriano-Souza et al., 2008). Based on these results it is possible to hypothesize that neutrophils function at the front line of the immune system, responding immediately upon request, and direct the migration of other cells to the inoculation area some hours afterwards (macrophages and lymphocytes). It appears, therefore, that neutrophils participate effectively in the adaptive immune response from the very beginning of the process (Vitoriano-Souza et al., 2008). In this sense, the investigation of the kinetics of cell migration to the inoculation area is extremely relevant since the number and types of cells recruited immediately after inoculation will stimulate the innate immune system and will influence the development of acquired immunity.",

These results suggest that after administration of each inocula, a microenvironment of mixed type I and II cytokines develops in the skin of animals. Cytokines play a decisive role in the regulation of the immune response directed against L. infantum, determining the prevention or progression of the infection (Carrillo and Moreno, 2009). Several studies have demonstrated that a mixed cytokine pattern can be associated with resistance or susceptibility in both vaccine and Leishmania-infection models (Raziuddin and Abdalla, 1994, Peruhype-Magalhaes et al., 2006). In murine leishmaniasis, several researchers have observed that IL-13 synthesis promotes initial IFN-\u03b3 production and influences the assembly and maturation of tissue granuloma. However, such experiments have not addressed the mechanism(s) by which IL-13 regulates the expression of anti-leishmanial type 1 response (Murray et al., 2006). Menezes-Souza et al. (Menezes-Souza et al., 2011) demonstrated that asymptomatic Leishmania-infected animals present high expression of IL-13 with concomitant IFN-\u03b3 production. The authors suggest that inflammatory cytokine profiles, particularly those driven by IFN-\u03b3, TNF- \u03b1 and IL-13, could be used as biomarkers for asymptomatic clinical forms in CVL.",

These chemokines preferentially recruit monocytes to the skin, suggesting a host strategy for controlling parasitism during ongoing CVL infection (Menezes-Souza et al., 2011).
