            "text": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.1 It contributes to a large number of acute admissions to hospital. There are seasonal peaks in these episodes.2 This trend in admissions is set to rise and represents a major expenditure in the health services.2, 3 Molecular techniques for the detection of respiratory viruses have recently been developed. Viruses have been identified in 39\u201356% of COPD exacerbations.4, 5, 6 In asthma, correlations have been found between the seasonal patterns of upper respiratory infections in children and adult hospitalization.7 We hypothesized that a similar association could be obtained between paediatric viral respiratory tract infections and adult admissions with COPD. We obtained data from the regional laboratory. Respiratory samples are routinely screened for viral pathogens on children admitted to hospital. This should reflect the prevalence of upper respiratory infection in children attending hospital at that time. Adult admissions with COPD were recorded from a general hospital in the greater Belfast area.",

Adult hospital admissions with COPD (ICD code J44.0 or 496.0) for the same time period were identified from the Mater Hospital, an urban general hospital in Belfast. Patients were admitted to hospital following a decision to admit by a senior Doctor in the emergency department. Those patients who were coded on discharge as having other co morbid conditions contributing to their admission (e.g. left ventricular failure) were excluded from the analysis.

            "text": "The correlation between COPD admissions and the detection of respiratory syncytial virus 2 weeks previously reflects the longer incubation period of respiratory syncytial virus infection. By comparison influenza B was associated with a rise in COPD admissions in the same week; this virus has a shorter incubation period. It is notable that the regression analysis did not identify any particular virus as having an increased relative risk with respect to subsequent COPD admissions when the analysis was performed on data in which seasonal variation in COPD admissions had been removed. Previous investigators have demonstrated no seasonally related differences in disease characteristics for COPD exacerbations,14 thus in removing seasonal variation prior to analysis the true effects of viral detection on COPD admissions may be been masked.",

There are increased admissions in older people in winter. Fleming showed that acute respiratory infections are associated with hospitalization and increased mortality.16 This is reflected in the main findings between viruses in children and adult COPD admissions which have been highlighted in this study. It reinforces the health service implications of winter infection and increased exacerbations of COPD. It is also noteworthy that the peak death rate is in patients diagnosed with acute respiratory disease.16 Influenza has been linked with increased health care use by children and the elderly. There is an excess mortality particularly in the elderly.17 Several studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness and positive economic aspects of influenza vaccination in children18, 19 and associated reductions in respiratory morbidity amongst their household contacts.20 This study supports previous evidence that COPD patients benefit from influenza vaccination.",
