            "text": "Human monkeypox (HMPX), caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) which belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus, is a zoonotic infection and is characterized by smallpox-like signs and symptoms with a lower case fatality (Beer and Rao, 2019). The similarities with smallpox include timing of symptom onset, rash distribution, and timing of rash occurrence (Petersen et al., 2019b; WHO, 2017, 2018). Since the first HMPX case was reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970, several outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in west and central African countries (Beer and Rao, 2019). The number of HMPX cases has increased significantly over the past two decades (Durski et al., 2018; Petersen et al., 2019b) and it is now considered the most important Orthopoxvirus from a public health perspective because of this increase in cases (Yinka-Ogunleye et al., 2019). Recent HMPX outbreaks were reported in Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Liberia, Nigeria and Cameroon (Beer and Rao, 2019; Ogoina et al., 2019; Yinka-Ogunleye et al., 2019). In the 2017\u20132018 outbreak in Nigeria, after not being reported for over 20 years, the case fatality rate was 6% (Yinka-Ogunleye et al., 2019). Imported HMPX cases also have been reported in the United States (Reed et al., 2004; Sejvar et al., 2004), the UK (Vaughan et al., 2018), and Israel (Erez et al., 2019). In Asia, the first confirmed HMPX case was reported in Singapore in May 2019; the patient was a Nigerian man who attended a workshop in Singapore (Ng et al., 2019). The emergence of HMPX in different locations throughout the world indicates that this is a problem of global importance.",

This indicates that there is the potential for human-to-human transmission of MPXV in healthcare facilities between cases and either other patients or healthcare workers (HCWs). Healthcare centers are one important source of MPXV transmission. Healthcare-related transmission have been reported in many countries in Republic of the Congo (Learned et al., 2005), Central African Republic (Nakoune et al., 2017), Nigeria (Yinka-Ogunleye et al., 2019), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Petersen et al., 2019a). There is approximately 1% HCWs have been infected for every 100 HMPX cases (Beer and Rao, 2019; Petersen et al., 2019a).",

With very rare cases and relatively new disease in the region (Ng et al., 2019) and lack of knowledge of HMPX (Harapan et al., 2020), frontline HCWs might have no confidence managing the cases if a HMPX outbreak occurred. This problem has been shown for other emerging infectious diseases; in Taiwan, for example, more than 70% of nurses expressed a lack of confidence being involved in managing severe acute respiratory syndrome (Hsu et al., 2006). The present study was undertaken to assess GPs\u2019 confidence in one of the Asian countries, Indonesia, in facing HMPX cases based on their current knowledge, skills and their workplace facilities.

The population was all registered GPs. In Indonesia, a GP is awarded after a course of six years and a clinical internship in medical schools. Afterwards, GPs are eligible to complete non-clinical higher degrees (i.e. master's and doctoral degrees) or enroll in residency programs to become a specialist doctor. GPs completing the non-clinical degrees are still considered GPs, whereas GPs completing residency training are considered specialists and not GPs. GPs are the frontline HCWs in Indonesia. They are responsible for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of a wide range of diseases. Citizens must first visit with a GP at a community health center before being able to be referred to a higher-level hospital (Harapan et al., 2018b; Yufika et al., 2020). Because no similar study had been conducted, to calculate the sample size it was assumed that 50% GPs would have good confidence. There are 50,198 GPs in Indonesia in 2019; and using a confidence interval of 95% and a 5% margin of error, 382 respondents were required as minimum sample size. To recruit study participants, using a convenience sampling method, the invitations to complete the survey were distributed to the social media platform (WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram) and sent by email to the members of doctor groups or organizations (Indonesian Medical Association and Indonesian General Practitioner Association). The survey was made using Survey Monkey. Up to two reminders were sent after the initial message. No randomization was conducted. Before participating, the candidates were provided with information on the aims of the study, its expected benefits, the study team members and contact details of the principal investigator. They also informed that they could exit the survey at any point. Those who agreed to participate were asked to provided their consent to participate. The survey was estimated to take approximately 7\u201310 min to be completed.",

Educational attainment was dichotomized into GP and GP with master or doctorate degree while type of job was divided into GP and GP with residency.The current location of participants was initially divided into the western, central and eastern part of Indonesia. Due to the low number of GPs in the eastern part, we combined the eastern and central regions together. Individual monthly income was measured by asking the participants to choose the closest amount of money from a provided list in Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and then dichotomized to less than IDR 5 million (equivalent to less than US$ 356.3, using a November 2019 exchange rate) and IDR 5 million or more (US$ 356.3 or more).bWorkplace characteristicsIn this domain, the participants were asked about the type and location of the workplace. Type of workplace was divided into community health center (known as Pusat Kesehatan Masyarakat [Puskesmas]), private clinic, private hospital and public hospital. The location of workplace was divided into district, regency and province, which can be classified as rural, sub-urban or urban setting.cProfessional characteristicsThe participants were asked their alma mater and the length of medical experience. Medical experience was defined as distance in years between the first time the participant received the first medical license and the time of survey.

There is only a small percentage of GPs in Indonesia who have good confidence in diagnosing and treating HMPX cases in clinical settings. One factor associated with confidence was the length of experience in medical practice. Previous studies found that the length of learning experience (Chen et al., 2019; Hsieh and Nolan, 2015) and prolonged attachment and training in healthcare centers increased self-confidence in medical practices (Lonnbro et al., 2019; McNair et al., 2016). However, a systematic review of 12 studies between 1966 and 2004, found that longer experience in medical practice was associated with less knowledge (Choudhry et al., 2005). A majority (63%) of studies showed that more experienced GPs, i.e., those with more years of experience, were actually more apt to not adhere to standards of practice for diagnosis, screening, and prevention (Choudhry et al., 2005). It could be that GPs with longer experience in our study were more confident but less knowledgeable. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the more-experienced GPs receive adequate training and continuing medical education activities (CME) (Choudhry et al., 2005).",

This result is plausible since knowledge is not the only aspect of effective patient management. Clinical diagnostic skills and appropriate experience are other factors that produce effective patient care. Miller's pyramid of competence suggests that despite good knowledge being foundational to achieving proficient clinical skills, clinical skills are at a higher level compared to knowledge (Shumway et al., 2003). The phenomenon is also relevant to the theory of competency development and internalization, the Johari's Window (Ramani et al., 2017). Individuals with good knowledge might understand their limitations so that they are \u2018conscious incompetent\u2019. Hence, there would be hesitance in managing this particular case. Nevertheless, this less-confident attitude is a good entry point for implementing a reflective learning practice (Ramani et al., 2017), to advance from being an \u2018unconscious incompetent\u2019 to a \u2018conscious competent\u2019 through an experiential learning journey (Yardley et al., 2012).",

This is the only factor associated with GPs\u2019 confidence in multivariable model, indicating that incorporating material into medical education could have a large impact on confidence compared to information received from other sources. Learning in a formal curriculum during medical education would provide a better learning experience since an informal information may result in inconsistent outcomes (Baker et al., 2011). Learners might face conflicts when they are learning from informal resources due to lack of guidance (White et al., 2009). Unfortunately, the Indonesian Standard of Medical Doctor Competency do not include HMPX as one of the compulsory diseases to be mastered by Indonesian medical graduates (Indonesian Medical Council, 2012). Incorporating HMPX into Indonesian Standard of Medical Doctor Competency would force Indonesian medical schools to teach HMPX to medical students. One of the important findings of this study is that GPs who were working in community health centers were more likely to agree that HMPX should be involved in the National Medical Curriculum. This indicates, in part, that those working in frontline health central facilities felt a need to have more information about HMPX.",

This is probably can be explained because the first HMPX case in Asia, May 2019, was reported in Singapore (Ng et al., 2019) which is geographically close to the smaller Indonesian island of Batam and the larger island of Sumatra. Afterward, the Indonesian government strengthened the surveillance system in Batam and the main island of Sumatra by installing thermal scanning system in five ports and preparing hospitals to care for HMPX patients (Fadli and Arbi, 2019).
