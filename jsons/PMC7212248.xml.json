As of March 31, 2020, this pandemic has affected 801,400 people and killed 38,743 people across the globe. The experience from China, the source of the outbreak, and other countries affected by the pandemic has shown the magnitude by which healthcare facilities can be overwhelmed during this crisis. Worldwide measures to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 of this medical emergency have been implemented, so as to buy time for the national healthcare infrastructure and resources to gear up to deal with this catastrophic illness. Hospitals also face a challenge to cater the needs of their existing sick patients, particularly those with malignancies. With this pressure on healthcare facilities combined with other realities of increasing cancer incidence, the need for special resources in oncology care, guarded prognosis in many malignancies and semi-emergent nature and need of cancer treatment, it is extremely difficult for an oncology healthcare personnel to decide who gets treatment for cancer and who has to wait. While the oncologist makes this judgement, they welter between maintaining a balance between logical and philosophical decision making during this crisis. As cancer surgeries involve significant healthcare resources in terms of infrastructure, intensive care unit beds, blood products and manpower, surgical oncologists face a dilemma regarding the triage of surgical patients during this period of uncertainty. Guidelines, laid by professional organisations like the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO), American Cancer Society (ACS), European Association of Urology (EAU), Indian Association of Surgical Oncology (IASO) and Federation of Head Neck Oncology (FHNO) are predominantly based on expert opinions and are vague at places. Herein, we intend to review triage guidelines for cancer surgery, laid down by these associations around the globe.",

These epidemics have taught us to initiate response interventions in the form of early detection, containment, control and mitigation [2].

Unlike the SARS-CoV, patients of SARS-CoV-2 can transmit the infection during the incubation period as well [3]. The age group with the highest risk for acquiring primary and secondary cases of infection is 50\u201365 years (most cancers are found in the same age group). About 50% of patients have a subclinical infection, 30% have mild to moderate symptoms and 20% can develop severe symptoms with 5\u201310% requiring ICU care and ventilatory requirement. Symptoms common to most coronavirus infections are fever, chills, generalized myalgia, drowsiness, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The median duration of viral shedding is about 20 days and longest known to be 37 days, with continue shedding until death, unaltered by the administration of antiviral drugs such as Ritonavir and Lopinavir [4]. The median time of requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation reported is 14.5 days, and the median time to death being 18.5 days [4]. Sepsis, followed by respiratory failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heart failure, acute kidney injury, shock and secondary infections (including ventilator-associated pneumonia) are the common complications with severe infections [4]. The virus can be isolated from oropharyngeal and respiratory secretions and also in stool samples of affected individuals. However, the virus has not been isolated in the blood or urine [5]. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend RT-PCR for laboratory diagnosis of SAR-CoV-2 [6]. China, where the pandemic started, has now entered the post pandemic or the transitional phase, and clinical epidemiological data from China can prove to be a guiding light for the management of cases. So far social distancing, a modern form of quarantine, has proven to be the most effective preventive strategy for containment of this pandemic. Two drugs, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, have shown in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 [7, 8]. Further population studies with these drugs are awaited, and it will take another few months till we have a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.",

Cancer patients are at heightened risk for infection owing to suppressed immunity due to the malignancy per se and secondary to the effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. Also, reports have shown an increased rate of complications, need for ventilatory support, admission to intensive care units, overall poor prognosis and death in cancer patients with COVID-19 infection. A particular concern for a cancer surgeon is to weigh the risk of deferring cancer surgery versus the risk of COVID-19 exposure and infection to patients as well as health care providers. Disruptions in outbreak mitigation strategies like social distancing and prudent utilization of limited health resources also need consideration in this regard [10, 11].",

            "text": "Cancer surgeries utilise substantial resources in a hospital including diagnostic modalities, blood products, ICU beds and even ventilators. Hence, it is imperative to carefully decide the treatment plan for every patient by involving the multidisciplinary team, deciding which ones can safely be kept on the waiting list or started any bridging therapy until surgery. Existing COVID-19 cases, less volunteers for blood donation due to lockdown and rejection of donors due to history of exposure, symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity can further dwindle the availability of the blood and blood products. Although there exists a theoretical risk of transmission of the virus in blood products, currently there is no data suggesting transmission of SARS CoV-2 by transfusion. However, the American Association of Blood Banks and European Center for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC) have suggested deferral of blood donation by patients with a history of probable exposure and travel (by 3 weeks) and COVID positive cases (by 4 weeks). However, routine screening of donors is not yet recommended [12, 13]. Published Chinese reports on the outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19 indicated a 3.5 times higher risk of needing mechanical ventilation or ICU admission or dying compared with patients without cancer [10]. Thus altogether, subjecting a cancer patient to surgery has its own risks to the patient and burdening the hospital resources. However, delaying the cancer surgeries have other implications like an increased extent of surgery in the event of cancer progression, increased perioperative morbidity/mortality and also missing a chance of offering cure due to disease spread caused by waiting. These facts cannot be overseen, also, cancer is a bigger problem than COVID-19 from patient\u2019s perspective. Table 1 summarises various studies addressing the impact of time to treatment initiation or delaying surgeries on cancer survival [14\u201327]. Keeping these concerns in mind, some guidelines have recommended a possible triage (Table 2) to offer surgeries, even during the course of an active pandemic, for certain precarious malignancies who are known to have rapid progression.",

The American Association of Anaesthetists has provided excellent guidelines to follow during this pandemic. Some of the important measures are attention to surface and equipment cleaning during and between cases, regular glove changing, regular handwashing, avoiding high flow devices especially if not using personal protective equipment (PPE), video laryngoscopy assisted intubation where possible and ensuring appropriate disinfection procedures. Airway manipulation puts the anaesthetist and all healthcare workers at exposure to aerosols from the patient. Aerosol generating procedures during administration of general anaesthesia include bag and mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation and open airway suctioning. It is preferable to use regional anaesthesia wherever feasible, with added advantage of less effect on pulmonary function as compared to general anaesthesia [31\u201336]. Considering the significant risk of COVID transmission related to anaesthesia, it is prudent to defer the non-emergent surgical interventions. However, cancer surgeries cannot truly be considered as non-emergent interventions as there is a real risk of disease progression during the waiting period.",

The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related and possible feco-oral transmission of the virus has also been suggested. Hence, any elective gastrointestinal surgery/endoscopic procedures can pose a threat of transmission to surgeons and health care workers. Cases that clearly require emergency intervention like obstruction, perforation and massive bleeding obviously cannot be deferred. Hu et al. [38], Yu G et al. [39], Luo et al. [40] and Chen et al.

Neoadjuvant therapy should be offered wherever possible in advanced gastrointestinal cancers. Obstructing growths of gastroesophageal junction or colon without signs of peritonitis should be offered endoscopic stents wherever feasible. For bleeding tumours, Transcatheter arterial embolization is an option if facilities are available. Liver malignancies amenable to ablation, transarterial embolization and stereotactic surgery should be tackled accordingly [29]. Pre-admission screening of every patient to rule out asymptomatic infection and RT-PCR panel with chest CT scan for patients with fever (> 37.3 \u00b0C), travel history and positive contact history is recommended for gastrointestinal cancer patients due for surgery. Extra precautionary measures should be taken for medical staff involved in the surgical procedures. Local governing authorities should be informed if one has to perform any emergency surgery on SARS-CoV-2-infected patient. Cytoreductive surgeries with or without HIPEC for peritoneal surface malignancies of low-grade malignancies can be deferred. Post neoadjuvant therapy cases can continue with therapy [29]. Chinese studies have recommended a laparoscopic approach over open for colorectal surgeries; however, the measure to contain the aerosol dissemination during pneumoperitoneum has to be dealt with care [40, 41].",

CT imaging is essential for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of microbiological tests and the CT picture might be confusing in these patients. Hence, a careful history of exposure, along with strong index suspicion, is required to rule out COVID-19. Smoking, one of the commonest risk factors in lung cancer, has not been independently shown to affect the mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patient; however, pre-existing chronic obstructive lung disease is associated with increased mortality [4]. Perforated oesophageal malignancies, threatened airways, anastomotic leaks, bleeding, post-operative complications like hemothorax, and empyema need immediate intervention and need to be taken to theatre on priority basis [28]. Tian et al. [42] reported post-operative mortality in one out of two patients with lung cancer, who were detected SARS-CoV-2-positive after surgery. Xin et al. [43], Yan et al. [44] have reported specific recommendations for the management of lung cancer in the COVID-19 epidemic, but these articles are published only in the Chinese language and hence difficult to interpret for others.",
