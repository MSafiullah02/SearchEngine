Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the causative agent, is an ongoing emergence enveloped, single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA virus, with genome length about 27.6 kb. It is the prototype of the Gammacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family (Bande et al., 2017; Masters & Perlman, 2013). IBV mainly targets the respiratory tract of its natural host\u2014 chicken, causing severe respiratory system disease, and spreads via respiratory and feco\u2010oral routes. Additionally, IBV also infects the uro\u2010genital tract, digestive system and reproductive system, resulting in nephritis, salpingitis, proventriculitis and egg drop (Bande et al., 2017; Jackwood & Wit, 2013; Sjaak de Wit, Cook, & van der Heijden, 2011).",

To prevent IBV infection, researchers have developed various commercial inactivated and live attenuated vaccines over the past decades, which successfully prevented IBV infections (Jordan, 2017). As a highly mutable coronavirus, however, the continuous emergence of novel IBV strains greatly emasculate vaccines efficacy, and the low cross\u2010protection rates of IBV vaccines inevitably hamper the prevention and control of the disease (Fan et al., 2018; Jordan, 2017).",

The result revealed that most of the amino acid mutations in S1 region of the newly identified IBV strains were located in the three HVR regions. Meanwhile, several amino acid mutations were only found in HeN\u20102/China/2019 (P87L, T300I and H329Y) and HeN\u2010101/China/2019 (Q89K, S96A, Q97E, S117A, T120R, A130E, R131S, A195S, Q315H and I511M) among GI\u201019 strains (Table 1). Compared with the available capsid structure of M41 strain in the PDB database (Shang et al., 2018), the P87L and Q89K mutations are adjacent to HVR I and HVR II region structurally (Figure 3c) and located in the major receptor\u2010binding domain (19 aa\u2010253 aa; Promkuntod, van Eijndhoven, de Vrieze, Grone, & Verheije, 2014); the Q97E, S117A, T120R, A130E and R131S are in HVR II region; the T300I and H329Y are in HVR III region (Figure 3d), indicating that these mutations might change virus antigenicity.",

The first case of IB in China dates back to early 1980s, and since then, the outbreaks were constantly emerging and numerous IBV strains were identified, of which strains in genotype GI\u201019 (refers to the QX\u2010like or LX4) became predominant among chickens currently, although the QX strain was initially identified in 1996. Additionally, other genotypes of IBV, such as GI\u20101 (Mass), GI\u20107 (TW\u2010I or TW\u2010like), GI\u201013 (4/91\u2010like), GI\u201016 (Q1\u2010like) and GI\u201022 (YN\u2010like and SAIBK\u2010like), were also frequently detected in China (Han et al., 2018; Li et al., 2012; Lin & Chen, 2017; Mo et al., 2013). Importantly, several novel IBV genotypes, including GI\u201028, GI\u201029 and GVII\u20101, were identified recently (Chen et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019). All these indicated that the IBV strains circulating in China are genetically diverse, providing a potential platform for recombination and greatly challenging the current biological control measures.",

GI\u20101 genotype vaccine H120 has been the most widely used vaccine in China until now, which shared a very low homology of identity with the emerging GI\u201019 strain HeN\u20101/China/2019 (32.2%) and HeN\u20102/China/2019 (32.2%) in glycoprotein S1 gene region, and even the other GI\u201019 strains identified recently. These results indicated the H120 vaccine could not provide effective protection against GI\u201019 genotype strains infection, which might explain the clinical phenomenon that a number of IBV outbreaks emerged in vaccinated flocks (Lin & Chen, 2017).",

Similar to the previous studies, we discovered several recombinant events between GI\u201019 and other IBV genotypes with great possibilities. All these results indicated the GI\u201019 genotype strains were constantly evolving. In China, the genotype GI\u201019 vaccine QXL was just approved in the last year (data from the National Veterinary Drug Basic Information Database of China). The continuous emergence of IBV variants undoubtedly facilitates evading immune protection induced by vaccination, as well as adapting to new environment, which would greatly challenge the efficacy of the newly developed vaccine.",

Fortunately, one live attenuated vaccine targeting GI\u201019 genotype has been licensed in 2018, which might provide an effective role in controlling the disease in China. The result also highlights the importance of further surveillance to define the variations and distribution of this virulent strain of IBV among the Chinese flocks, which helps to carry out proper preventive measures to limit its devastating effect for poultry industry.",

However, there are still some evolutionary distance between the newly identified IBV strains and other GI\u201019 strains and contain several special amino acid mutations in the HVR regions of S1 protein, suggesting that Chinese IBV strains constantly emerge and evolve towards different directions. This study provides an insight on recently emerging IBV outbreaks, which shows the need to carry out proper preventive measures and control strategies.",
