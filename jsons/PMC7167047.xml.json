Ten commercially important cultivars were studied, of which eight were selected among the most widespread in the top producing countries (Australia, California, Italy, and Spain),26, 27, 28, 29 and two were new cultivars obtained in recent breeding programs.27, 28 In detail, the cultivars examined were the Australian \u2018Johnston Prolific\u2019 (JPcv), the Californian \u2018Texas\u2019 (TEcv) and \u2018Thompson\u2019 (THcv), the Italian \u2018Filippo Ceo\u2019 (FCcv), \u2018Genco\u2019 (GEcv) and \u2018Tuono\u2019 (TUcv), the Spanish \u2018Desmajo Largueta\u2019 (DLcv), and \u2018Marcona\u2019 (MAcv), as well as \u2018Francol\u00ec\u2019 (FR\ncv) and \u2018Ferragn\u00e8s\u2019 (FEcv), the latter two being the new ones, recently grown in Italian and Spanish new plantations.27, 28 Among these cultivars, the Italian \u2018Tuono\u2019, is also grown in Greece, Libya, Tunisia and in Spain (where it is known as \u2018Guara\u2019).30 All almond cultivars were grafted, on sweet almond cv Don Carlo, by T\u2010budding in the fall onto almond seedling rootstocks, a common grafting technique used for almond orchards located in the Mediterranean region and already used in other studies.31, 32 Almond cultivars were grown under rainfed conditions and with a tree spacing of 6.0 m \u00d7 6.0 m. All trees had the same age, and standard cultural practices were performed. Fruits were randomly collected from four different trees for each cultivar at two different harvest times, as follows: (i) T\n1 (14 July 2016) corresponding to stage \u2018J\u201933 \u2013 that is, an early stage of almond maturity, when the fruit was still unripe, with green and moist hull, but with developed cotyledons, easily separable from almond skin; (ii) T\n2 (between the second half of August and the beginning of September 2016), corresponding to stage \u2018L\u201933 \u2013 that is, ripe fruits with dry brown hull. Whole fruits collected at T\n1 and T\n2 were quickly stored at \u221218 \u00b0C until analysis. Then, the hull and shell were removed to obtain the kernel. Finally, almonds were finely milled by an electric grinder (B7301, Imetec, Azzano S. Paolo, Bergamo, Italy) and analyzed with three replicates. Samples at T\n1 were lyophilized (De Mori, Milan, Italy) prior to milling.",
