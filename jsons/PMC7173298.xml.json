            "text": "The genome of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis viruses (CPVs) normally consist of 10 dsRNA segments (Payne & Mertens, 1983), however, some CPVs have 11\u201312 dsRNA segments (Zhao et al., 2003a, Zhao et al., 2003b). The genome of Trichoplusiani cypovirus type 15 (TnCPV-15) and Antheraea mylitta cypovirus type 4 (AmCPV-4) is composed of 11 dsRNA segments (Qanungo et al., 2002, Rao et al., 2003). Each dsRNA segment of BmCPV is composed of a single complete open reading frame (ORF). These open reading frames (ORFs) code for the structural as well as non-structural proteins and polyhedrin. Genome analysis of the BmCPV H and I strains revealed that segment S1, S2, S3, S4, S6 and S7 encode viral structural proteins such as VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6 and VP7, while segment S5, S8, S9 and S10 encode non-structural proteins p101 (NSP5), p44 (NSP8), NS5 (NSP9) and polyhedrin, respectively (Cao et al., 2012). The eleventh dsRNA segment was found in the Bombyx mori cypovirus type 1 (BmCPV-1), which was termed as small polyhedron gene segment (SP) (Arella, Lavallee, Belloncik, & Furuichi, 1988). The twelfth dsRNA segment was also identified in the BmCPV-1 with novel RNA extraction methods (Nagae, Miyake, Kosaki, & Azuma, 2005). The functions of these newly found dsRNA segments are still undefined. A unique characteristic of the dsRNA viruses including BmCPVs, is their ability to accomplish transcription of the dsRNA segments. 5\u2032 end of BmCPV genome was processed by adding cap and methylation that form a cap like structure, mGpppAmpGp, protecting mRNAs from degradation by exonuclease enzymes which cuts uncapped mRNA in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction (Furuichi, 1978). All of the dsRNA segments in the genome of BmCPV have the similar conservative sequence (GUUAA\u2026\u2026GUUAGCC) in the end (Kuchino, Nishimura, Smith, & Furuichi, 1982), which were predicted as the recognize signal for RNA transcriptase and replicase, or related with both ribosome and mRNA, or assembly with viral structure (LA, 2001). These conservative sequences were also found in the genome of Dendrolimus punctatus (Zhao et al., 2003a, Zhao et al., 2003b).",

The prokaryotic expression product is 50 kDa (p50). However, anti-p50 can detect one band with 56 kDa from the BmCPV-1 infected BmN4 cells. By using the same antibody, the bands with 34, 36, 38 and 40 kDa from the virion can be detected (Jin, Peng, Wang, Zhang, & Zhang, 2014). M2 gene of Reovirus serotype 1 encoded protein \u03bc1 could be cleaved into capsid protein \u03bc1C, which can interact with S4 gene encoded protein \u03c33 to complete the assembly of the virion (Wiener & Joklik, 1988).

CPV caspid three-dimensional structure analysis showed that there are several protuberances (large protuberance and small protuberance) in the surface of caspid. It was suggested that p50 is processed by posttranslational modification to form the protuberance for the attachment of the virion to the targeted cells (Cheng et al., 2011).

Recombinant protein (VP7) was purified from the 1 L BL21 cells with Ni-NTA (Ni2 +-nitrilotriacetate) resin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using standard procedure. Mouse was immunized with recombinant protein (VP7) for preparing the VP7 polyclonal antibody. Booster injections were administered according to the manufacturer's instructions. The collected serum was stored at \u2212 70 \u00b0C.",

Vp7 gene is encoded by the S7 segment, and the function of it is still unclear. In this report, it was demonstrated that 4, 2 and 5 bands of vp7 gene products, recognized by a polyclonal anti-VP7 antibody, are present in BmCPV virion, BmCPV infected cells and BmCPV infected silkworm midguts and 3 bands in transfected cells overexpressed with vp7 gene. These polypeptides appeared may be encoded by a single open reading frame (ORF) produced from the specific AUG codons of vp7 gene. Sequence analysis found that BmCPV vp7 gene contains nearly 17 AUG codons in vp7 ORF. All of these short mRNA encoded > 100 codons, and only 3 short mRNAs were inconsistent with the ORF of vp7 gene. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these short polypeptides were initiated from non-AUG codons, or truncated VP7 was generated from the cleavage by the proteolytic enzyme. Coding capacity of viruses is enhanced with the evolving overlapping reading frames. Until now, the segmented dsRNA genome of the viruses including Reoviridae, Coronaviruses and Orbivirus families were thought to be monocistronic (i.e. ten genome segments encoding ten proteins), but the identification of novel ORFs, translated in the same reading frame that begin at an alternative downstream AUG, changed this assumption (Gong, Chen, Chen, Kuo, & Shih, 2014). Rice black-streaked dwarf virus genome segments S5, S7 and S9 were bicistronic mRNA, which were involved in the formation of tubular structures, the formation of viroplasms, virus replication and assembly occurrence. At least 9 novel ORFs were found from the genome of coronaviruses. They were considered as the accessory proteins involved in viral pathogenicity (Shukla & Hilgenfeld, 2015). A small ORF in segment 10, overlapping the NS3 ORF in the + 1 position was identified from the genome of bluetongue virus (BTV) (Stewart et al., 2015).",

            "text": "In this study, we concluded that short products of VP7 were appeared in the gels, which might play a significant role in BmCPV life cycle. Further experiments on these short VP7 products will be carried out in our future studies. Voltage-dependent anion channels belongs to a class of porin ion channel and positioned on the outer mitochondrial membrane (Hoogenboom, Suda, Engel, & Fotiadis, 2007). It act as a general diffusion pore for small hydrophilic (water attractant) molecules (Benz, 1994) and helps in the exchanging of ions and molecules between mitochondria and cytosol and is regulated by the interactions with other proteins and small molecules (Hiller, Abramson, Mannella, Wagner, & Zeth, 2010). VDAC has been shown to play a significant role in apoptosis. During apoptosis, increased permeability of VDAC allows for the release of apoptogenic factors (Tsujimoto & Shimizu, 2002). VDAC-like protein in Rhipicephalus microplus may play important role in the infection of Babesia bigemina (Rodriguez-Hernandez et al., 2012). Previous studies suggested the apoptosis induction is carried out by the upregulation of VDAC which results in enhanced permeability of outer mitochondrial membrane. The possible reason is thought to be a shift in the VDAC equilibrium to an oligomeric form of the protein which forms large pores and thus allows the release of pro-apoptotic proteins (Ghosh, Pandey, Maitra, Brahmachari, & Pillai, 2007). Furthermore, many viruses encode proteins that act on VDAC to control apoptosis in infected cells (Boya et al., 2003), such as Influenza A and Hepatitis B viruses (Boya et al., 2004). Whether VDAC function is important during Babesia bigemina invasion, propagation or replication must be determined in the near future. In the later period of BmCPV infected silkworm larvae, nearly 5 bands were found from the midguts. The alternative hypothesis was that VP7 was produced by the proteolytic enzyme. In our previous study, the analysis of VP5, encoded by the S5 fragment of BmCPV, showed that it has Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2Apro-like protease domain which is a short polypeptide of 16 amino acids. The function of this domain is in breaking of the polyprotein of FMDV at the 2A/2B junction co-translationally. This cleavage occurs at its carboxyl terminus at a glycineproline amino acid pair (Ryan et al., 1991, Mattion et al., 1996). Whether it might be taking part in the cleavage of the VP7 still need further investigation. Approximately 5% of gag gene (such as lentiviruses, human immunodeficiency virus, simian immunodeficiency virus) produced other proteins causing by the ribosomal frameshift with independent functions (Rue, Roos, Tarwater, Clements, & Barber, 2005). Two mechanisms for generating more than one protein from a single mRNA have been reported. One possibility is through leaky scanning, such as paramyxoviruses (Kozak, 1989) and Rabies virus. The other possibility is a cap-independent mechanism, such as picornavirus polyprotein and Sendai virus proteins (Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988, Curran and Kolakofsky, 1989). Why VP7 exited various protein expression patterns among virion, infected cells and larvae? PeptideCutter online software was used to predict the potential cleavage sites cleaved by proteases in VP7. BNPS-Skatole, Iodosobenzoic acid, NTCB (2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid) and Caspase1 were predicted to be the potential enzymes(Table 4\n). In the future, to better understand the potential cleavage mechanisms of VP7, these proteins with small molecular weight will be purified from the BmCPV virion and then will be identified with the mass spectrum analysis.",

            "text": "In this study, we also conducted the experiments for revealing the function of vp7 gene in the viral life cycle. Down-regulated vp7 gene transcript level decreased the transcript level of vp1 gene in BmCPV infected silkworm larvae and BmN cells. It was indicated that vp7 gene was associated with the BmCPV genome replication. The reason for the decline of genome replication due to the reduction in expression level of vp7 gene was that during the cell entry of the progeny virus, the VP7-VP4 outer layer un-coats releasing the intact double-layered particle (DLP) into the cytosol. VP4 mediates cell binding (Fiore, Greenberg, & Mackow, 1991) and membrane disruption (Denisova et al., 1999, Kim et al., 2010), but the final steps of DLP delivery require un-coating of VP7 (Cuadras et al., 1997, Liprandi et al., 1997). Full un-coating of the outer layer is also required to activate the DLP (Lawton, Estes, & Prasad, 2001), which contains multiple copies of the viral polymerase complex that synthesize and extrude mRNA transcribed from each of the 10 genome segments. The vp7 transcript was reduced because the VP7 layer anchors the VP4 spikes onto the underlying DLP was less, leading to the membrane disruption failure (Chen and Ramig, 1993, Trask and Dormitzer, 2006). The new mRNA transcribed from each segment was decreased, leading to the reduction of the genome replication.",
