Bacteremia incidence data for each group were logit transformed to generate caterpillar plots using the \u201cmetan\u201d command previously [16, 17]. For CNS bacteremia, this transformation proceeds as follows: with the number of patients as the denominator (D), the number of patients with CNS bacteremia as the numerator (N), and R being the CNS bacteremia proportion (N/D), the logit (CNS bacteremia) is log(N/(D \u2212 N)) and its variance is 1/(D \u00d7 R \u00d7 (1 - R)). Note that for any group with a zero event rate (N = 0), the addition of the continuity correction (i.e., N + 0.5) is required to avoid indeterminate transformations of the logit proportion and its variance. For each bacteremia type, the benchmark is the summary incidence as derived in the caterpillar plot of the observational groups. This benchmark is used as a reference line in the plot of the component groups from the antibiotic and chlorhexidine-based studies.",

Firstly, there are multiple decontamination agents, regimens, and strategies and not all studies were sourced from systematic reviews. Second, the studies have been published over three decades with consequent heterogeneity in the populations and study designs. Several had novel study designs with one or more intervention groups and either one or no control group. Hence, given these two limitations, the summary effect sizes derived here as displayed in Fig. S1 are indicative and intended for internal reference only. Of note, however, is that the summary effect estimates  of these decontamination interventions on overall bacteremia here is similar to that in recent respective systematic reviews [14, 15].",

Of note, the strength of an exposure as a risk factor will differ for a subject-specific estimate, as in a case control study, versus a population-averaged estimate, as in the analysis here.

Tallying these hypothetical with the known CNS bacteremias (n = 555) among the 10,986 intervention and CC control group patients of the SDD/SOD studies as noted here (Table S3) would give 776 CNS bacteremias among a hypothetical total of 27,986 (10,986 + 17,000) patients for an overall hypothetical incidence of 2.8%, which does not quench the excess.",
