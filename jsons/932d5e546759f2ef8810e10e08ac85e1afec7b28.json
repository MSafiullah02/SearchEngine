This quantity is usually computed using the reported number of cases, but ignoring that many more individuals may be infected (e.g. asymptomatics). We propose a statistical procedure to quantify the impact of undetected infectious cases on the determination of the effective reproduction number. Our approach is stochastic, data-driven and not relying on any compartmental model. It is applied to the COVID-19 case in eight different countries and all Italian regions, showing that the effect of undetected cases leads to estimates of the effective reproduction numbers larger than those obtained only with the reported cases by factors ranging from two to ten. Our findings urge caution about deciding when and how to relax containment measures based on the value of the reproduction number.",

An accurate evaluation of the transmission potential of the disease provides invaluable information to guide the decision-making process of control interventions, and to assess their effectiveness. One of the key epidemiological variables in this respect is the effective reproduction number R, defined as the average number of secondary cases per primary case of infection. In order to stop an epidemic, R needs to be persistently reduced to a level below 1. The issue of providing reliable estimates of R is particularly severe now during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic [1] , and urgently calls for efforts towards a comprehensive mathematical modelling of the outbreak.",

It is nevertheless possible to use our results (especially the credible intervals) to define some robust criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of the containment measures.Our findings can be used by public health institutions to take more informed decisions about designing and gauging the strategies of infection containment. According to our results, we recommend caution in deciding when and how to relax the containment measures based on the value of the reproduction number, since it may be much larger than usually estimated.Acknowledgements M.P. thanks R.
