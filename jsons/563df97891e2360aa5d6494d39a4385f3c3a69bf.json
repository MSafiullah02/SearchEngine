While a mechanistic explanation has yet to be proven a robust antiviral immune response in young patients that simultaneously truncates the clinical course and induces the microangiopathic changes could lead to chilblain-like skin lesions. This or a similar explanation would then posit that chilblain-like lesions would be most likely to appear only after a successful viral response is mounted with lesions detected only when symptoms are likely to be subsiding. We review the rapid evolution of the chilblain-like presentation in patients with COVID 19 beginning with its first description in early March 2020 and summarize the evolving but rapidly selfconfirming data.",

Amidst a panoply of unusual findings for a viral respiratory illness including induced coagulopathies, 1 renal dysfunction 2 and cardiac arrests, 3, 4 a suspected cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19, chilblain-like skin lesions -\"COVID toes\"has garnered particular attention both in the medical literature and in the national media. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] While COVID-19 was initially reported to have few or no cutaneous findings, 15 a multitude of skin manifestations have now been described. Purported cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 range from those commonly observed with viral illnesses, e.g., maculopapular and urticarial eruptions, 7, 16 to the more unusual, e.g., varicella-like eruptions 7 or livedoid and necrotic skin lesions. 5, 7 These findings merit further study to parse true viral associations from those of potential confounders including acute or latent co-infections, medical complications of disease and adverse reactions to medication.",

            "text": "Similarly, the chilblain-like presentation is an unexpected association with COVID-19. Historically chilblains, or pernio, has been defined as an exaggerated skin response to cold in predisposed individuals. 17 It is characterized clinically by pink to violaceous papules arising on acral surfaces, most commonly the hands and feet (Figures 1 and 2) . Histologically, chilblains is an inflammatory disorder showing dermal edema along with a superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Chilblains may be idiopathic or associated with systemic disease, such as autoimmune conditions, certain genetic mutations, hematologic malignancy and less commonly infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). 17 Cold agglutinins appear to play a role in chilblains associated with EBV. 17 Chilblains is a relatively rare condition; a Minnesota case series recorded an average of 9-10 diagnoses per year across an entire tertiary academic department. 17 In early March 2020, nearly 3 weeks after community spread of COVID-19 was documented in Italy, a 13-year-old boy developed pruritic red-violet lesions on the toes in the setting of fever, myalgia and headache. 11 Family members were reported to have had fever, cough and dyspnea six days prior. While testing for COVID-19 was not possible in this case an association was suspected. Shortly after this index report, images of similar acral lesions in the feet of children with suspected COVID-19 were circulated on \"Amici DermPed,\" an Italian pediatric dermatology forum. 11 In mid-March, the French Union of Dermatologists and Venereologists (SNDV) created a text messaging group on WhatsApp\u00ae to share information. 6 One week later, a case of chilblain-like lesions was reported via WhatsApp\u00ae and with the help of \"re-posts\" through Facebook\u00ae between the two platforms, 146 individual chilblain-like cases were subsequently circulated. 6 Intensified medical and lay interest in this phenomenon was reflected in unprecedented Google searches for \"coronavirus toes\". 18 In the second week in April, just one month after the initial report of chilblain-like lesions in Italy, the American Academy of Dermatology, the Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance and the Spanish General Council of Podiatrists announced registries that would facilitate the study of chilblain-like lesions and COVID-19. 10, 19, 20 This month-long evolution from first informal reports to national specialty-level registry formation is striking. A detailed timeline is presented in Figure 2 .",

            "text": ",21 Lesions appear late in the evolution of COVID-19 symptoms, often during convalescence. Finally, although a history of upper respiratory tract infection in patients and family members is sometimes elicited, 7,22 evidence of infection is not consistently or regularly found when evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. In one of the first studies on the topic, Piccolo et al reported 63 cases of chilblainlike lesions during the Italian COVID-19 outbreak; PCR data was available for 11",

Among these patients, COVID-19 infection was confirmed in 41, yielding an overall rate of 23.8%. This is a strikingly low rate of testing positivity for a viral-associated phenomenon, especially as SARS-CoV-2 can shed for up to 37 days in some patients;30 at the same time, 23.8% is also well above any expected background rate of active COVID-19 infection. Possible explanations for the discrepancy include insufficiently sensitive diagnostic testing, delayed onset of symptoms after clearance of infection, enhanced viral clearance in patients with chilblain-like skin lesions or admixed diagnoses of non-COVID-19 related chilblains due to confounding factors; regarding the latter, it has been an unseasonably cold Spring in the United States and heightened self-detection may be occurring in patients with idiopathic chilblains following COVID-19-associated media attention.31 A mechanistic explanation for the low rate of testing positivity among these patients was put forth by Kolivras and colleagues, who hypothesized that a robust antiviral type I interferon response in young patients may simultaneously truncate the clinical course and induce microangiopathic changes leading to chilblain-like skin lesions.26 According to this hypothesis, patients present with chilblain-like lesions only after mounting a successful viral response; thus, lesions are detected when symptoms are likely to be subsiding. While more studies are needed to validate this hypothesis, it is consistent with the findings presented by Galv\u00e1n-casas et al which showed chilblainlike lesions are unique amongst the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in occurring primarily late in the disease course. 7 Regarding its possible association with a robust immune response, emerging data on the occurrence of a pediatric Kawasaki-like syndrome, termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, amongst children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection suggest that immune complications may eventually be recognized in a larger fraction of those infected. 13,32 Rigorous studies with improved diagnostic testing, including validated antibodybased assays, measurement of COVID-19 viremia and tissue biopsies with lesional PCR or immunohistochemistry are needed to fully elucidate the relationship between chilblain-like lesions and COVID-19. These data may have significant implications for clinicians, patients and public health officials, including the potential for transmissibility and the need for self-isolation. The impact of the latter may be somewhat limited if these lesions occur in the period of convalescence. The study of chilblain-like lesions, as in many domains of the global COVID-19 pandemic, is intense and ongoing. The usually deliberate scientific process has moved apace, from the first documented case of chilblain-like lesions in March 2020 to the formation of national registries a mere month later. These undertakings may eventually explain current knowledge gaps, including strikingly low rates of testing positivity and a pauci-symptomatic presentation in many patients. While elusive yet, the pathogenesis of chilblain-like lesions may provide important clues both to the virulence of SARS-CoV-New-onset chilblain-like lesions diagnosed in May 2020 in Boston, Massachusetts.
