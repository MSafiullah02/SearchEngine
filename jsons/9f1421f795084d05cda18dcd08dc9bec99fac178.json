Also, we propose an optimal strategy to implement the optimal campaigns through the use of awareness campaigns in region j that aims at protecting individuals from being infected by the virus, security campaigns and health measures to prevent the movement of individuals from one region to another, encouraging the individuals to join quarantine centers and the disposal of infected animals. The aim is to maximize the number of individuals subjected to quarantine and trying to reduce the number of the infected individuals and the infected animals. Pontryagin's maximum principle in discrete time is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimality system is solved by an iterative method. The numerical simulation is carried out using Matlab. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio was calculated to investigate the cost-effectiveness of all possible combinations of the four control measures. Using cost-effectiveness analysis, we show that control of protecting susceptible individuals, preventing their contact with the infected individuals and encouraging the exposed individuals to join quarantine centers provides the most cost-effective strategy to control the disease.",

For example, [4] formulated a mathematical model for MERS transmission dynamics and estimating transmission rates. They estimated the basic reproduction number using the estimates of the transmission rates in the first two periods. Drosten et al [5] provided a description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses. Guery et al [6] analyzed the clinical features of infected cases. Tahir. M et al [7] used a nonlinear mathematical model to study the dynamics of the transmission of MERS-CoV in human population through an agent known as camel. They divided their population into two classes: humans including (susceptible humans S(t), infected humans I (t), recovered individuals R(t)), and camels including (Susceptible camels (S c ) and Infected camels (I c )). They have found the basic reproduction number R 0 and discussed the stability analysis of their model using the basic reproduction number. They found that the model is locally asymptotically stable at disease free equilibrium E 0 when R 0 < 1 and when R 0 > 1, endemic equilibrium exists and becomes stable. In their research, equilibrium points are also globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. Besides these, many mathematical models were formulated to investigate the dynamics of infectious diseases with control (For example: [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] \u2026).",

In this research, we will adopt discrete-time modeling where statistical data are collected at a discrete-time (day, week, month, and year). Treatment and vaccination of some patients are also given at a discrete-time. Therefore, it is more direct, more convenient, and more accurate to describe a phenomena using discrete time modeling compared to continuous time modeling. The use of discrete-time models may avoid some mathematical complications such as the choice of the area of function and uniformity of the solution. Thus, difference equations appear as a more natural way to describe epidemiological models. Moreover, numerical solutions are used for discretionary differential equations and this encourages us to employ the difference equations directly. The numerical exploration of discrete time models is easy, and therefore can be easily implemented by mathematicians [7, [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

The strategies that we introduced include four controls: the first represents awareness programs, the second represents health measures and security campaigns, the third represents the effort to encourage the exposed individuals and the infected individuals to join quarantine centers and the forth control represents the disposal of the infected animals. Pontryagin's maximum principle in discrete time was used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimality system was solved by an iterative method. The numerical simulation was carried out using Matlab. Numerically, the optimal control strategies that include protectiing individuals from being infected by the virus, security campaigns and health measures to prevent the movement of individuals from one region to another, encouraging the individuals to join quarantine centers and the disposal of infected animals (Strategies 1, 2, 3 and 4) showed significant differences in the number of the exposed humans, infected humans, quarantined humans and infected animals compared to the case where controls are not used. Using cost-effectiveness analysis, we showed that strategy 3 (protecting susceptible individuals, preventing their contact with the infected individuals and encouraging the exposed individuals to join quarantine centers) is the optimal and the most effective strategies.",
