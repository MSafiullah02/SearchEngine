As for good and for bad, all is globally interconnected, that minute incident in China is the reason why we live in lockdown, basic civil liberties are limited, many deaths and suffering, and locally my hospital being near collapse. Hospital de La Princesa, an old 450-bed, tertiary hospital in downtown Madrid, Spain, had its D Day on March 30, 2020, when a total 552 COVID-19 patients were admitted, and 120+ more patients were in the emergency room, impatiently waiting to be admitted [2] . Many twopatient rooms already had three, even four occupants. Our petite, modern ICU room with 17 beds had to be stretched to 73 beds, by invading two surgical theatres turned to critical care, as well as the entire Psychiatric ward. Mirroring ancient times, all mentally ill patients, including those with active, severe paranoid schizophrenia or major depression, were sent home with their relatives to make room for others requiring invasive mechanical ventilations, mostly with improvised ventilators, or by reusing disposable ones, or duplicating machines with home-made technology. Even friends who have been veteran volunteers with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Syria's civil war, or at Sierra Leone's Ebola zone, were not ready. Using military terminology, La Princesa was a war-time hospital in the front line; my Respiratory department with thirteen staff plus eight residents, suffered eleven \"casualties\", counting quarantines plus infections plus one admission with severe, bilateral pneumonia. But other Madrid hospitals were hit even harder; colleagues at Hospital La Paz or Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, were suffering an even worse avalanche of patients to care for. All like a modern hecatombe, literally from the ancient Greek \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, hekat\u00f3n, \"one hundred\" and \u03b2\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, bo\u0169s, \"ox\", a religious sacrifice of a hundred oxen to indicate a great catastrophe with great mortality, or the end of the world.",

It is still severely and seriously affecting our old ones and others with heart, lung and other chronic diseases. But not only them. Several colleagues of mine, young, completely healthy, even athletic, have been admitted into the same ward where the previous day they We still don't know whether an immunological, genetic factor, a combination of risk factors, or serendipity make this little RNA virus collapse your bronchi and lungs with a thick \"snail snot or slime\" and accompanied with an inflammatory outburst killing some perfectly healthy lungs. As Dr Landete was explaining to junior residents in the morning clinical round: \"-This is the first time that I have seen the occurrence of acute sudden respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in front of my eyes. In the emergency room I was examining a walk-in 52 yr-old, female patient with temperature, malaise and a dry cough, and within 20 min, I had to call an ENT colleague to intubate this patient, as she had developed the fastest, quickest ARDS I've ever seen\". Even after all their greatest efforts and in the best hands, they could not save her. It is indeed a nasty little bug [4] . However, there is always hope, and as seen in great literature, times of crisis bring out the best in us. To date, I have seen residents choosing to stay longer after finishing a 24-h duty to try and save one more critically ill patient; auxiliary nurses improvising aprons and boots with trash bags, who, on finally receiving their space suits, posed for posterity like a football team, always with a ready smile (Fig. 1) ; residents in Neurology, Immunology or Pathology becoming Chest Medicine residents; medical students volunteering to learn the practicalities of lung mechanics and gas exchange; a Department Head creating a blog aimed at praising individuals for outstanding bravery and commitment; or I have been privileged to lead a small Think Tank including nurses, doctors, physicists, engineers and other friends who from Saturday March 14 have met on a daily basis to brainstorm initiatives by videoconference at 7 am, just before seeing patients or awakening their families. Many of the above have been living for 2 weeks in hotels next to our hospital, extremely and severely sleep deprived for a month already (Fig. 2) . Our hospital administrators recommended all staff not to take weekends off until further notice. No one disagreed, trade unions included, out of a 2000+ headcount. And this has been going on for nearly a month. Again, all always with a ready smile. This is the so-called, Esp\u00edritu de La Princesa.",

That was the easy part. Realizing that behind every case there was a personal tragedy, a family loss, slowly broke my heart and my lungs. So many people dying alone in elderly homes and residences, without medical care, without any care. I imagine not even anyone holding their hands.

But we have no room for pessimism. I remember reading Essay on Blindness by the Portuguese author Jos\u00e9 Saramago; happily, the panic and selfishness in his outbreak of sudden blindness only occurred in his literature. Let's only imagine if Gabo's inspiration were by nowadays COVID-19 pandemic, and his Love in the Time of Cholera, were rewritten. Or La Peste by French novelist Albert Camus who, at the premature age of 46 died in a car accident near Sens. Camus, not wearing a safety belt in the passenger seat, died instantly. But, what a life! La Peste tells the story of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. Nevertheless. it is not a medical book, but about human passions during and after an outbreak. Can't wait to re-read it.",

However, their work would all be a lost effort without the cleaning personnel, wardens, cooks and cafeteria caterers, administrative workers, security forces, lab technicians, and other hospital-based job groups. They suffer this modern plague equally, often without protection, mostly without recognition, but always proudly; working 24/7, weekends included, and again always with a ready smile.
