This study aims to 6 assess the levels of disease knowledge and risk perception among pharmacists. We 7 also recognize predictors of risk perception and perceived media roles. Methods This 8 is a questionnaire-base cross-sectional study. The questionnaire was developed on a 9 web-based platform and invitations were sent to pharmacists nationwide to participate 10 in the study using social media applications. Results A total of 486 pharmacists 11 participated in this study, where females were dominant (78.6%, n= 382). Most 12 (40.4%, n=198) pharmacists scored 4 out of 5 in basic disease knowledge, and more 13 than half were able to recognize common methods of spread. Risk was highly 14 perceived among participants, and was predicted by gender, living area, and having 15 children (p<0,05). Frequency of watching the media and sources of information also 16 influenced both risk perception and perceived media roles. Conclusion Disease 17 awareness among pharmacists, as well as risk perception must be considered for 18 effective risk communication planning. The role of media in shaping perceptions 19 should also be carefully studied to encourage compliance with government 20 containment measures and engagement in preventive behaviors. 21 22 51 include vaccine administration, such as during the H1N1 outbreak, drug distribution, 52 health education, and providing direct patient care under exceptional conditions 13,14 . 53 Therefore, ensuring sufficient knowledge and awareness of pandemics among 54 pharmacists, in addition to recognizing factors shaping their risk perceptions and 55 communication practices, are vital for the prevention and control of disease. 56 Media was found to facilitate obtaining of up to date available information improving 57 knowledge, awareness, and practices of both healthcare workers and general public 15 . 58 Also, it plays a key role in communication between researchers, scientists, public 59 health experts and funding agencies, for effective and rapid global response 15,16 . The 60 emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak grabbed the attention of media news, press, 61 and social media pages. However, there are too many sources and sites through which 62 any one can obtain information, and many of them are not credible which resulted in 63 misinformation and difficulties to distinguish between rumors and reality. Thus, 64 health care workers and the public must refer to trustworthy sources and information 65 regarding COVID-19 such as WHO which provided social media teams and technical 66 risk communication to respond and track rumors and myths 11 . Additionally, 67 government and health care facilities should provide transparent and clear 68 communication with health care workers, staff, and public regarding COVID-19 69",

Through its crossing 28 species, it was found to cause a cluster of frequently severe respiratory infection cases 29 in human population that greatly resemble the clinical manifestation of viral 30 pneumonia 3-5 . While first reports from initial investigations of this outbreak in 31 Wuhan, China indicated that most cases are associated with wildlife animals and a 32 seafood market where these patients had worked or visited, and the nonexistent of 33 COVID-19 transmission between humans and if so, it could not spread easily between 34 them 6 . However, now it is clear that such spreading occurs 7 and many confirmed 35 cases were identified among contacts with patients with COVID-19 and among 36 healthcare professionals, and most of these cases lack direct contact with this animal's 37 market. Thus, transmission between human populations has been confirmed in china 7 38 and many other countries 8,9 and has rapidly evolved into a global health emergency 39 as declared by World health Organization (WHO) 10 74 This is a cross-sectional study based on self-reported questionnaire. The questionnaire 75 was developed on a web-based platform to facilitate completion and collection of data 76 during the quarantine period. Invitations were sent to pharmacists nationwide to 77 participate in the study using social media applications. The link to the survey 78 questionnaire was included in the sent invitations. Pharmacists were informed prior to 79 their participation that their participation is anonymised, voluntary, and that their data 80 will be treated as confidential. Also, a brief description about the study purpose was Questionnaire Development 86 Scales for measuring perceived risk towards COVID19 and perceived role of media 87 have been developed, for the most part, in studies relating perceived role of media to 88 the perceived risk of acute infectious diseases. We developed a set of main ideas and 89 primary items directly relevant to our topic were based on current scientific literature.",

Those who watched the 160 media weekly, compared to daily or monthly, also had higher risk perceptions. Other Risk perception of pandemics can predict compliance with preventive measures and 190 tendency to seek treatment or vaccination 18, 19 . Furthermore, identifying how risk is 191 perceived is important for creating risk communication plans 20 . Unlike other reports, 192 where female gender has been linked to more worry and engagement in preventive 193 and treatment-seeking behaviors 21,22 , we find males to have higher perception of risk. 194 Additionally, living in city areas, having children, and working in a hospital pharmacy 195 are all associated with a higher perceived risk of the coronavirus pandemic. Other 196 studies also report a strong association between age and risk perception. For example, 197 Jacob et al found that younger age (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) predicted higher disease concern 20 . In 198 contrast, a study of 1,290 US adults showed no association between age and 199 engagement in protective measures during the H1N1 influenza pandemic 23 . In our 200 study, those below 25 and above 35 years had the highest risk perception, but the 201 difference was not significant. This could be due to lower participation of younger age 202 groups (<20 years) in both our study and the study from the US. Distinction between 203 city and rural areas can also be justified by the variation in case numbers between 204 different geographic areas 23 . Therefore, we expect higher concern about viral spread 205 in the more crowded cities. Jacobs also finds no association between having elderly 206 and children in the household and disease concerns. This is however inconsistent with 207 results from a similar study, where more household members predicted increased 208 precautionary activities 23 . It is justified as children can be more susceptible to viral ",
