The improved understanding of the virus structure and its destructive actions with hyperinflammation and dreadful systemic manifestations points to the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach. Such an approach is required for timely diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and preventing further spread of the virus in the community. SARS-CoV-2 has four major targets: the N protein covering the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA), the E protein encompassing the viral envelope, the M protein protruding from the cell membrane and the S protein that engages with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on host cells. Specific neutralizing IgG antibodies to N and S proteins, which are less prone to mutate, may provide successful host immunity; these are also potential targets for future vaccination strategies (A). Antibodies to E and M proteins, which often mutate, may not be protective against SARS-CoV-2. Cross-reactive antibodies which are generated in response to measles and other known viral vaccines may offer a degree of anti-SARS-CoV-2 protection (B). Intravenous immunoglobulin and neutralizing antibodies in convalescent serum may block the virus entry to host cells (C) and dampen hyperinflammation (D). SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, N = nucleocapsid, E = envelope, M = membrane, S = spike.",

The syndrome rapidly develops as an excessive immune response to the virus, triggered by inflammatory cells infiltration in the lungs, activation of T-helper 1 reactions and abundant release of proinflammatory cytokines into the circulation. 14 Immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drug therapies along with cardiorespiratory fitness are viewed as potential strategies for limiting the destructive effects of cytokine storm in COVID- 19. 15 While results of evidence-based research studies are expected to accumulate in the coming weeks and months, physicians confronting COVID-19 are now offered practice recommendations based on uncontrolled case series and expert opinion. In the absence of the long-term prospective studies, hypotheses are generated to launch cohort studies and trials on prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Some of these hypotheses may lack justification and pose ethical challenges. The interpretation of such hypotheses needs to be done through the prism of research reporting standards. 16 In the absence of highly effective antiviral drugs and approved COVID-19 vaccines, the urgent response to the virus spread may include boosting the immune system and utilizing virusneutralizing antibodies. In this article, we overview perspectives of antibody production and immune therapy in COVID-19.",

It is believed that virus-neutralizing antibodies, even in small quantities, can be effective when used for prevention or treatment of early symptoms of COVID-19. The emergency administration of the serum is primarily indicated in individuals with chronic underlying diseases, healthcare workers, and healthy subjects who have contacted infected patients. The resultant passive immunity may last for weeks and months. 33 Although antibodies can be collected and stored for a long time, timing for their optimal use depends on the likelihood of mutations that may change the virus characteristics. Ideally, antibodies should be used within days of collection. The same antibodies cannot be effective if used beyond a seasonal outbreak. 34 A big issue is the shortage of convalescent serum with high titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies. An unpublished study of 175 Chinese patients who recovered from mild COVID-19 revealed that about 6% of the patients do not produce detectable level of neutralizing antibodies and about 30% of them present with very low titers. 35 In all these patients, antibody production increased at day 10 to 15 after disease onset. Surprisingly, elderly (60-85 years) and middle-age (40-59) patients, who presented with lower lymphocyte counts and higher level inflammatory markers, produced significantly higher amounts of neutralizing antibodies than younger (15-39) patients. 35 Another Chinese cohort study demonstrated that 9% of recovered patients repetitively present with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 symptoms within 17 days of recovery, pointing to high baseline viral load, various immune dysfunctions, and virus persistence. 36 Interestingly, a large Chinese study (n = 173) of seroconversion and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection rates revealed that total antibodies against the virus were present in about 40% of patients within 1 st week of disease onset and in all patients after 2 weeks. 37 During the same periods, RNA detectability decreased from 67% to 45%, 36 raising concerns that not all specific antibodies are able to neutralize the virus. Variable timing and deficiency of antibody production in a sizable proportion of COVID-19 patients pose yet another challenge, questioning the utility of antibody tests and related \"immunity passports\" in the general population. 38",

Although empirical experience with plasma therapies during previous coronavirus epidemics alerted physicians of the risk of anaphylactic reactions, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and hemolysis, 43 no serious adverse effects have been reported during the current pandemic.",

Identifying and standardizing the required mAbs is even more sophisticated task since the variability of the receptor-binding proteins can yield irreproducible results. 45 One of the initial in-vitro studies that aimed to clone mAbs reported high titers of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) 1 subunit of the surface protein and its receptor-binding locus in the majority of recovered patients. 46 Reportedly, only a small fraction of these antibodies potently blocks the interaction with ACE2. The results of harvesting these blocking mAbs by using human B cells are promising, although no any attempt has been made to conduct related clinical study and explore the risk of adverse effects such as transfusion-related acute lung injury.",

It is apparent that isolation, social distancing, use of personal protective equipment, and proper individual and population hygiene decrease exposure to the deadly virus and minimize risk of severe COVID-19. Such protective measures can primarily save lives of high-risk individuals, such as children, pregnant women, medics, patients with underlying immunosuppressive and other chronic diseases, and the elderly. It is hypothesized that individuals regularly vaccinated against some infections, such measles and tuberculosis, may demonstrate better outcomes when exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Considering all safety issues, high-risk populations should undergo regular vaccinations to train their immunity and actively produce antibodies that may cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Given the limitations",
