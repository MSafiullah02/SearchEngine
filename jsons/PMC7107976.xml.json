A higher incidence was found in areas with an intermediate or high degree of urbanization, compared with areas with a low degree of urbanization. It is possible that the risk of person-to-person transmission increases with increasing population density. A higher incidence for practices that participated in the case-control study was also seen in a study of gastroenteritis [21].

This might be attributed to the developing immune status of young children and their vulnerability to infections [23]. Furthermore, part of the increased physician's care for young children might be explained by a heightened level of parental anxiety, because interpretation of clinical signs and distinguishing between uncomplicated and significant illness can be difficult in early childhood [24]. As was also found by Monto et al. [2], the incidence decreased in the older age groups. Although respiratory viruses are known to cause substantial morbidity in elderly people, no increase in the incidence of GP consultations was seen in our study [3, 25]. The relatively low influenza activity during the study may have played a part in this [20].",

This percentage is considerably higher for the youngest age groups: viruses were detected in 68% and 40% of the control subjects aged 0\u20134 and 5\u201314 years, respectively. To our knowledge, only 2 other studies have investigated respiratory pathogens in persons without an ARTI [15, 32]. Johnston et al. [32] reported that 12% and 4% of asymptomatic children and adults, respectively, tested positive for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Graat et al. [15] reported that 4% of persons aged \u2a7e60 years who did not have respiratory complaints tested positive for rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. Frequencies of subclinical respiratory infections in these studies were substantial lower than were those observed in our study: 68%, 55%, and 51% for asymptomatic children (age, 0\u201315 years), adults, and persons aged \u2a7e65 years, respectively; this is probably because our study covered a wider range of pathogens. However, the percentage of subclinical infections in our study might have been overestimated, because we did not observe the control subjects for the subsequent development of symptoms. Although control subjects had no respiratory complaints before or at the moment that the nose/throat swabs were obtained, we cannot rule out the possibility that they were in the incubation period for an ARTI. From a questionnaire completed by case patients and control subjects, we know that the rates of exposure to persons with respiratory symptoms within or outside the household were 38% and 56%, respectively, for case patients and 24% and 30%, respectively, for control subjects. Graat et al. [15] included a follow-up period of 8 weeks and excluded only 8% of the control subjects because they developed respiratory symptoms. So, even if \u223c10% of our control subjects would have had cases in the incubation period, we still found a substantial number of subclinical infections. For 1 of the 3 control subjects for whom influenza virus was detected, the GP reported that this child did not develop respiratory complaints in the 4 weeks after the nose/throat swab was taken.",
