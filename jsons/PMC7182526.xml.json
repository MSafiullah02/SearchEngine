Indeed, several viral epidemics over the past few decades have emerged with increasing frequency, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), H1N1 influenza, and more recently the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1]. Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) emerged from its epicentre in Wuhan province in China, and its subsequent rapid spread has pushed the capacity of the global public health community to its sheer limits. As of 30 March 2020, there were 752,747 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 36,226 deaths recorded worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).",

Furthermore, current PCR-based methods of analysis require (realistically speaking, particularly when dealing with increasing volumes of potential infected) upwards of 4-8 hours to process.

Subsequently, an extension reaction occurs using BIP on the product of FIP, and not on the template DNA due to displacement by DNA synthesis associated with the B3 primer. These reactions result in a product with a dumbbell-like structure which is essential for LAMP to establish isothermal amplification as the loop structures are always single stranded and can be annealed by FIP or BIP. This loop structure formation eliminates the denaturing step, which is otherwise essential in PCR for obtaining single-stranded DNA, and also establishes a cyclic reaction between the dumbbell-like structure and its complementary product, leading to elongated products with various copies of the target sequence produced (for reviews and detailed schematics, refer to [22], [23]).",

Of course, however, as with any emerging technology, there are some disadvantages associated with LAMP assays. Such methodology prevents inclusion of an internal PCR inhibition control, necessitating duplication of reactions while testing. Another disadvantage is the perceived complexity of the methodology, requiring a complex primer design system which can constrain target site selection and resolution or specificity. Furthermore, as the final product is a large fragment, downstream applications such as cloning are limited.",

As the growing number of suspected COVID-19 cases exceeds the capacity of many hospitals, many patients remain untested impeding efforts to the control the disease. A rapid, point-of\u2013care diagnostic for the COVID-19 is urgently needed, which we propose to be the LAMP method of detection (Table 1\n).",

            "text": "Considering the success obtained by Zhang et al., [34] using relatively less-sensitive LAMP, the enhanced sensitivity of the Penn-RAMP strategy employed by El-Tholoth et al., [32] attributable to a modified two-step LAMP protocol could prove significantly successful as a diagnostic. Penn-RAMP involves a preliminary reaction with outer LAMP primers to amplify all targets through recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), in which all targets are amplified concurrently. After this, a second highly specific LAMP reaction is initiated. Specifically, the first stage uses outer LAMP primers F3 and B3, while the second stage further combines the other 4 RAMP primers. This \u2018nested\u2019 principle significantly enhanced LAMP sensitivity by \u223c10-100-fold compared to normal LAMP, particularly when operating with purified and crude samples [35]. Indeed, the Penn-RAMP methodology when applied on mock trials by El-Tholoth et al., [32] provided a success rate of 100% at 7-10 copies of viral RNA per reaction, compared to a 100% success rate at 700 viral RNA copies required for PCR methods [32], [35]. To this degree, we hypothesise that the modified LAMP assay proposed by El-Tholoth et al., [32] perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19 (Figure 3\n), using the primer sequence strategies utilised (Table 2\n)",

Reagent-wise, the costs would be similar to that of real time RT-PCR, but the real advantage of this would be the rapidity of this assay, yielding results within an hour of testing, compared to 4-8 hours taken with RT-PCR methods. The aim is not necessarily a quantitative measure of infection, but rather a simple positive/negative assay for rapid detection/confirmation. We consider that this strategy should be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times.",
