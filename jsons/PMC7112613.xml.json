Such a program should ideally include the following elements: information/education on CARV infections/transmission, facilities for immediate risk-assessment, diagnosis and monitoring, the availability of highly sensitive syndromic multiplex PCR platforms, a real-time alert system for practitioners and an updated CARV management protocol including transmission control measures. The expected clinical benefits would be identifying CARV at an earlier stage of the disease (at the beginning of respiratory symptoms and before hospital admission), limiting outbreak situations and timely therapy with antiviral drugs or supportive care measures. The final end point would be a reduction in direct (CARV transmission, progression to LRTD, hospital and/or ICU admission and mortality)19 and indirect CARV effects (air flow obstruction, bacterial co-infection, COPD exacerbations and/or cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality).20\n,\n21 To date there is a lack of studies demonstrating the clinical benefit of conducting such a program compared to StCP.22\n",

Allo-HCT recipients with respiratory symptoms underwent CARV screening by syndromic multiplex RT-PCR panels as a first-line test. We attended recipients with respiratory symptoms in the outpatient transplant clinic during working hours. Transmission control measures were reinforced in the outpatient clinic following guidelines.24 We assessed the immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI)25 at the time of CARV screening and established an electronic real-time alert system for positive CARV results. We treated RSV and HPiV with oral ribavirin at early stage of the disease in the outpatient clinic according to our prior interventional protocol.26 Influenza infections were treated with oseltamivir at dose of 75 mg/12 h or 150 mg/12 h in severe cases or cases with long lasting symptoms (>3 weeks). In RSV and HPiV, oral ribavirin was given at a loading dose (maximum daily dose of 30 mg/kg) in the outpatient clinic whereas aerolized ribavirin at 2 g/8 h each course lasting 2 h was used in cases with LRTD. We also boosted annual flu vaccination awareness information. Finally, we prospectively collected clinical and laboratory variables at the time of CARV screening.

The first observation was the unusually high proportion of moderate to high-risk ISI (91%)9\n,\n25\n,\n30 suggesting that the StCP mostly focused on recipients at higher risk. However, the mortality rates of different CARV types with LRTD in this cohort (46% in EvRh, 38% in RSV, 23% in influenza, 50% HPiV and 57% in hMPV) were inside the intervals of that previously reported, ranging from 21% to 41% in allo-HCT recipients with EvRh LRTD,31\n,\n32 from 21% to 83% for RSV LRTD,17\n,\n20\n,\n22\n,\n25\n,\n31\n,\n33, 34, 35 6% to 45% for influenza LRTD,30\n,\n31\n,\n36 27% to 55% for HPiV LRTD27\n,\n31\n,\n37\n,\n38 and finally 6% to 43% for hMPV LRTD.39\n,\n40\n,\n41 Second, was the retrospective cohort subject to selection bias from retrospective studies reporting severe cases? We captured all documented CARV infection by retrieving data from the microbiology electronic system and crossing data with our transplant database. Our data rather point to the inaccuracy of our StCP CARV screening selecting recipients with severe features (58% of them at the LRTD stage, 83% with fever and 69% requiring hospital admission). Additionally, we observed that the likely lower sensitivity of rapid detection technics might have delayed the diagnosis, and importantly the start of antiviral drugs (2 days vs. 7 days, p = 0.02), in a significant proportion of recipients with RSV and influenza (25%) who initially tested negative through rapid detection technics. Although not statistically significant these recipients showed higher mortality rates in the StCP cohort (35% vs. 17%, p = 0.17). Our findings support the idea that the StCP resulted in a delay in starting antiviral therapy in a significant number of recipients which may also help to explain in part the differences in mortality among periods. Third, are the cohorts comparable, given the high proportion of risk conditions associated with mortality and the lower number of CARV episodes in the retrospective cohort? The fact that the cohorts had different risk conditions was a direct consequence of different CARV screening and management strategies between periods. However, when outcome comparisons were matched according to high-risk conditions of CARV mortality, we also observed significantly worse outcomes in the retrospective cohort (see Table 5). Therefore, our data suggest that the StCP likely led to CARV screening in high-risk recipients with severe features, delaying the start of antiviral therapy and consequently poorer outcomes, whereas the ProClinCarvSur-P led to screening and treating CARV earlier, in a larger number of recipients and with consequently improved outcomes.",

This assumption is supported by prior experience in another institution running the same ProClinCarvSur-P in allo-HCT recipients achieving low mortality rates (<5%) in recipients with RSV and/or HPiV LRTD.26 Although we suppose that several elements of the ProClinCarvSur-P have significantly contributed to these encouraging results, in our opinion the improvement has three major key points. First, the decision to using syndromic multiplex RT-PCR panels as the primary CARV test, a factor that undoubtedly increased sensitivity and specificity compared to rapid detection technics42 increasing CARV type detections. Consequently, a large number of CARV episodes (108 vs. 297 CARV episodes) and recipients (63 vs. 144 recipients) have been identified in the ProClinCarvSur-P cohort. Second, the CARV real-time electronic alert system was extremely useful for contacting recipients who tested positive in order to start antiviral therapy at an earlier stage of the disease. Third, the identification of CARV at earlier stage allowed us to early intervention with antiviral drugs in many cases (69 vs. 43 CARV episodes treated), particularly those with CARV URTD (34 vs. 12 CARV URTD episodes treated), RSV URTD (11 vs. 3 treated), HPiV (9 vs. 1 treated) and influenza (46 vs. 25 treated). Additionally, ProClinCarvSur-P may have promoted closer follow-up of recipients with CARV, which in turn could have contributed to identifying and treating indirect CARV effects. We can hypothesize that the observed improvement in CARV that have no effective antivirals drugs could be related to several factors. First, the identification of these viruses in recipients with airflow obstruction may have contributed to limit the misinterpretation of these pulmonary patterns as GvHD-related obliterant bronchiolitis, avoiding corticosteroids exposure that surely have reduced the CARV LRTD severity and/or the risk of all-cause mortality. Second, the close clinical monitoring in recipients with documented CARV infection may have led to early introduction of antibiotics in cases of bacterial co-infection suspicion reducing the rate of hospital admission in the ProClinCarvSur-P cohort (28% vs. 69%) and consequently limiting the severity of this indirect CARV effect. The sum of all these clinical circumstances may have contributed to the overall improvement observed in these CARVs. Finally, one of the most rewarding effects of annual clinical CARV sessions was the increased awareness of CARV infections and care taken by healthcare workers (including microbiologists, fellows, transplant physicians and nurses). Altogether, ProClinCarvSur-P may have contributed towards refining CARV screening, collection techniques and processing, greater acuity in identifying recipients with mild respiratory symptoms, timeliness of feedback of positive results and awareness of CARV transmission routes. Of note, our current policy also translated into an increased influenza vaccination rate (from 3% to 27%) which has also surely played a role in reducing influenza prevalence, influenza LRTD progression and hospital admission.9 Of note, this study confirms the value of ISI score in predicting mortality in several CARV type.43 The ISI was developed by investigators from the MD Anderson Cancer Center to predict LRTD progression and mortality in allo-HCT with RSV.25 The high-risk ISI category consistently predicts the severity of respiratory virus infections irrespective of the CARV type in our series.",

It is likely that its application could be expanded to other medical areas with probably similar benefits. National and transnational health authorities should promote such programs in tertiary health care centers worldwide by giving them priority and funding, such as in the World health organization BRaVe initiative against respiratory virus.44 Additionally, these programs could bring epidemiological data more realistic to public health authorities.",
