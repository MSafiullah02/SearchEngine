            "text": "This is the second in a two-part review of diagnostic cytopathology in veterinary medicine. As in human medicine, cytopathology is a minimally invasive, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic modality with broad utilization. In this second part, the diagnostic applications of cytology in respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, endocrine, ocular, and central nervous system tissues are discussed with a section describing fluid analysis in veterinary medicine. As noted in the previous manuscript, which characterized the cytology of the skin/subcutis, musculoskeletal, and lymphoid tissues, the interpretation of veterinary cytology samples must be undertaken with extensive knowledge of the breadth of animal species, including familiarity with the frequency and clinical progression of diseases, both of which can be influenced by species, breed, and husbandry conditions. Similar to part one, this review focuses on the most common domestic companion animal species (dog, cat, and horse) and highlights lesions that are either unique to veterinary species or have relevant correlates in people. The cytologic features and biological behavior of similar lesions are compared, and selected mechanisms of disease and ancillary diagnostics are reviewed when appropriate. Supporting figures illustrate a subset of lesions. While not an exhaustive archive of veterinary cytology, the goal is to give cytopathologists working in human medicine a general impression of correlates and unique entities in veterinary practice.

            "text": "The most common respiratory tissue samples evaluated by veterinary cytolopathologists include those from the nasal cavity (usually swabs, flushes, or aspirates), the upper and lower airways (in the form of tracheal washes, bronchoalveolar lavages [BAL]), and lung aspirates. Normal nasal cytology samples in most species are of low cellularity and are comprised of squamous and ciliated columnar epithelial cells accompanied by epicellular and extracellular commensal bacteria, while nasal associated lymphoid tissue and mucus can also be present. Nasal disease is relatively common in domestic species and is often of either infectious (typically bacterial or fungal) or neoplastic origin. Bacterial rhinitis in dogs and cats is often secondary to the presence of other inflammatory/ infectious disease or neoplasia, so superficial samples can be diagnostically misleading. In contrast, fungal rhinitis due to Aspergillus and Penicillium sp. in dogs or Cryptococcus sp. in cats can be primary, however, low numbers of fungal elements can be present in clinically normal dogs and cats (Fig. 1 ). Unique to horses are bacterial or fungal infections of the guttural pouches, which are paired, air-filled, auditory tube diverticula connecting the nasopharynx to the middle ear and, when infected may present with purulent or bloody nasal discharge as the primary complaint. Because of their complex anatomy, which includes their juxtaposition to several cranial nerves and the internal and external carotid arteries, diseases of the guttural pouch, particularly those of bacterial and fungal origin, can result in significant neurologic dysfunction or fatal hemorrhage. 1 The cytologic diagnosis of nasal neoplasia can be complicated by concurrent inflammation and dysplasia. However, a large, retrospective, canine cytology-histology correlation study demonstrated the utility of cytology in discriminating neoplastic from non-neoplastic processes in 86% of 138 dogs, with good concordance for the subclassification of tumors as carcinomas (most common), sarcomas, and round cell tumors (least common). 2 Lower respiratory tract cytology is often performed to identify infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic pulmonary disease, although occasionally these samples will reveal evidence of hemorrhage, often due to anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning in dogs or exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage in horses. It is particularly noteworthy that airway samples from indoor-housed horses may contain a variety of fungal hyphal fragments, spores, and macroconidia, which are generically referred to as \"barn fungus\" and considered contaminants of the airway tract rather than true pathogens. Overall, infectious pulmonary disease exhibits a similar spectrum of organisms as in people, with similar regional variation. In the Upper Mid-West, pulmonary blastocymosis is an important cause of canine respiratory disease and dogs are monitored as a sentinel species for human infection, although infected dogs are not considered a zoonotic risk (Fig. 2) . Pulmonary neoplasia, both primary and metastatic, is most common in dogs and cats and rare in the horse. Cytologic evaluation of either BAL or lung aspirates is capable of detecting multiple types of lung carcinoma, although tumor origin (primary vs. metastatic) or subtype cannot be distinguished cytologically. The lung can also be a primary site for hematopoietic neoplasia, including lymphoma and histiocytic sarcoma (Fig. 3 ).",

Systematic studies are lacking, but with the advancement of veterinary dentistry, there is opportunity for additional utilization of cytology to screen lesions, with a prospective study underway at our institution. Cytologic evaluation of the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract is usually performed on impression smears of endoscopically collected mucosal biopsies or ultrasound guided FNA samples of mass lesions. Cytology is most useful for the detection of some infectious agents (e.g., histoplasmosis) and in the diagnosis of certain intestinal neoplasms (e.g., lymphoma and adenocarcinoma). The architectural benefits of full-thickness section histopathology make it preferred over cytology for distinguishing lymphocytic inflammation from lymphoma in the diagnosis of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, which is common in both dogs and cats. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the liver is used very frequently in dogs and cats to evaluate elevated serum enzyme activities, investigate ultrasonographic abnormalities, and as part of the staging process for many neoplasms. Cytology is accurate for the detection of the hepatocyte vacuolar changes that, while often nonspecific, can accompany certain endocrinopathies, including diabetes mellitus and hyperadrenocorticism. In the cat, marked lipid vacuolar change accompanied by suggestive serum biochemical abnormalities is highly diagnostic for feline hepatic lipidosis, a metabolic syndrome triggered by acute anorexia that can be idiopathic, stress-induced, or secondary to other diseases (Fig. 6 ). For the diagnosis of hepatic neoplasia, cytology has moderate sensitivity but very good specificity and positive predictive value, including accurately classifying round cell tumors and hepatocellular and non-hepatocellular carcinomas. 3 In contrast, cytology has both low sensitivity and positive predictive value for inflammatory liver disease, in which case histopathology is recommended for definitive diagnosis. 4 Despite the importance of pancreatitis in both dogs and cats, concerns about the safety of sampling that organ have delayed the validation of pancreatic cytology as a diagnostic tool. Several small studies and one larger one suggest cytologic sampling of the pancreas is a low-risk procedure, which should promote further validation of this technique. 5, 6 Genitourinary Tissues",

            "text": "The cytologic evaluation of companion animal reproductive tissues is generally restricted to the canine prostate gland, as sampling of ovary and testes is relatively uncommon because most veterinary patients are spayed or neutered. Enlargement of the canine prostate gland can result from inflammatory, benign hyperplastic, or malignant neoplastic causes. Canine benign prostatic hyperplasia is common in older, male dogs, but because of anatomic variation between species, prostatic enlargement usually results in constipation and tenesmus rather than dysuria. 7 Cytology of hyperplastic prostatic epithelium is characterized by sheets of \"honeycomb\" appearing cells with minimal atypia (Fig. 7) . It is noteworthy that the Diagnostic Cytopathology DOI 10.1002/dc dog is the only other large mammal to develop spontaneous prostatic neoplasia at significant rates, which supports its usage as an animal model for human prostate cancer. 8 Prostatic malignancy in dogs can be of either urothelial (transitional epithelial cell) or prostatic (acinar-or ductular-epithelial cell) origin. Although the two cannot be reliably distinguished by cytology or routine histology, both are characterized by sufficient criteria of malignancy that discrimination from benign prostatic hyperplasia is rarely problematic. One very unique neoplasm of the canine lower genital tract is the transmissible venereal tumor (TVT), which is one of only two known naturally occurring, directly transmissible malignancies that clinically occurs as an exophytic mass on the perineum or the face and, epidemiologically, is considered enzootic in geographic regions with high numbers of free-roaming sexually intact dogs (Fig. 8) . Genetic analysis supports a macrophage origin, and most tumors spontaneously regress, although immune-compromised individuals may require treatment. 9 Cytologic evaluation of the urinary tract is primarily performed in dogs and cats with mass lesions or enlarged kidneys; cytology is not typically diagnostically useful for chronic renal disease or glomerulopathies. 10 Urinalysis is the mainstay of the diagnostic workup for mucosal disease of the bladder, but is beyond the scope of this review. Most renal FNAs are of low cellularity and normally contain blood and small clusters of welldifferentiated cuboidal epithelial cells that in cats are often characterized by the presence of scattered lipid droplets. Fragments of cylindrical renal tubules are occasionally noted and rarely intact glomeruli may be observed. Cytologic samples can be used to support diagnoses of renal cysts, pyelonephritis, and other lesscommon infections of the kidney.",

Cytologically, canine and feline thyroid tumors are almost identical, both manifesting a classical neuroendocrine appearance, namely a sample composed of fragile and frequently disrupted cuboidal epithelial cells with a moderate amount of light basophilic cytoplasm and indistinct cell margins. There is usually a single centrally placed round to oval nucleus with minimal atypia. Amorphous eosinophilic colloid is often observed (Fig. 10) . Despite similar cytologic findings, the biological behavior of canine and feline thyroid tumors are radically different, with the vast majority of canine tumors being invasive, metastatic, and nonfunctional while feline counterparts are almost always benign functional adenomas. Therefore, canine tumors are always presumed to be malignant, however, cytology is performed to distinguish thyroid origin lesions from other potential neoplastic and inflammatory lesions that occur in the neck region and throughout the Diagnostic Cytopathology DOI 10.1002/dc thoracic cavity due to the frequency of potentially neoplastic ectopic thyroid tissue in the dog. 14, 15 Cytology is occasionally used to evaluate adrenal masses in dogs. Pheochromocytomas, like other endocrine neoplasms, have a classical neuroendocrine appearance. Adrenocortical tumors are relatively common in dogs and ferrets. In both species, the tumors are usually functional and can be benign or malignant, with benign tumors indistinguishable from hyperplasia and overlap in the cytologic appearance between adenomas and well-differentiated carcinomas. Ultrasonographic evidence of 5 cm major axis length, metastatic disease, or thrombosis predict poor prognosis when histologic confirmation of malignancy is not feasible. 16 Adrenal cortical tumors of dogs are very similar to people and serve as an animal model for human disease, although levels of hormone secretion are significantly higher in dogs. 17 The disease in ferrets is slightly different, often the result of early neutering leading to the accumulation of neoplastic cells that secrete sex steroid and resemble steroidogenic cells of gonadal origin. 17 The syndrome is so classic that cytology of the adrenal glands in ferrets is often not performed.",

            "text": "Insulinoma of the exocrine pancreas is relatively common in the ferret, occasionally seen in dogs, but is rare in cats. Intermittent periods of symptomatic hypoglycemia in the absence of liver disease usually prompts imaging of the abdomen to evaluate animals for insulinoma or other malignancies that may produce similar clinical signs due to production of insulin-like growth factors. Although many insulinomas in ferrets are too small to detect by imaging, lesions can be visualized in dogs for the collection of cytologic samples, which can be diagnostic in combination with other clinical information. 18 Insulinoma cells have a generic neuroendocrine appearance similar to thyroid follicular cells; like thyroid tumors, cytologic atypia is a poor indicator of biological behavior and most insulinomas have aggressive biological behavior with estimates that most tumors have already metastasized by diagnosis. 18 Ocular Virtually all components of the globe and orbit can be cytologically sampled in all species; however the conjunctiva and cornea are the most frequent. Normal cytology of the dog and horse conjunctiva is composed primarily of sheets of superficial, intermediate, and basal epithelium. 19, 20 Conjunctival cytology can be used to detect hyperplasia associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which results in large numbers of keratinized squamous cells and can be used to classify the inflammatory infiltrate, and sometimes reveal etiologic agents, in infectious conjunctivitis. Like HSV-1 in people, 21 feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) is a major cause of acute and chronic keratoconjunctivitis in cats and can be cytologically characterized by eosinophilic inflammation, multinucleated epithelial cells, and intranuclear inclusion bodies, however for definitive diagnosis, PCR has better sensitivity. 22 Likewise, characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusions in the epithelial cells of canine conjunctival samples can support a diagnosis of distemper virus infection, which unfortunately has the potential to infect a wide spectrum of wild carnivores, including endangered species exposed to domestic dogs. 23 In horses, infection with nematode larvae of Habronema muscae, Habronema majus, or Draschia megastoma causes habronemiasis, a proliferative, ulcerative, and presumably hypersensitivity-mediated lesion of the eye and surrounding skin. 24 Cytologic findings include eosinophilic and mastocytic inflammation, however organisms may not be demonstrated and histopathology may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Corneal cytology is most useful in the diagnosis of infectious/inflammatory and, less commonly, neoplastic disease. Cytology samples from the normal cornea consist of non-keratinized squamous epithelial cells and cytologic evidence of keratitis can be seen as a result of infection with a similar spectrum of bacterial and viral etiologies as described for the conjunctiva. Unique to horses is a syndrome of idiopathic eosinophilic keratitis that is responsive to systemic immunosuppression. 25 Keratomycosis is of particular importance in horses, which are presumably predisposed because of the exposed position of the equine eye, instability of the tear film, and ubiquitous presence of fungal organisms in their environment. 26 Cytology is a standard part of the diagnostic process for suspected cases of equine keratomycosis and samples are characterized by a mixture of epithelial cells, many nondegenerate neutrophils, and fungal elements, most commonly Aspergillus spp., Fusarium, spp, and Candida spp (Figs. 11 and 12 ). Although in many cases organisms will be quite numerous, the sensitivity of cytology can be impacted by the predilection of organisms to grow deep into tissues, resulting in false negative cytology results. For this reason, culture and sometimes histopathology are also commonly performed. Although corneal neoplasia is rare, squamous cell carcinoma is among the most commonly observed.",

[32] [33] [34] Focal CNS disease, which is most commonly the result of neoplastic or inflammatory disease, is most amenable to cytologic examination. 35 In dogs and cats, meningioma is the most common primary brain tumor, representing 45% and 85% of cases of primary intracranial neoplasia. [36] [37] [38] Cytologically, meningioma is characterized by the presence of whorl formations of epithelial-or mesenchymal-appearing cells. 39 Of note, owing to shared clinical and genetic features, there is increasing evidence for the usage of the dog as a natural model for gliomas, which are the most common primary brain tumor in humans and the second most common in dogs. 40, 41 In addition to neoplasia, cytology of the CNS can be used to identify focal inflammatory lesions, most notably of fungal origin. With the possible exception of cryptococcosis, fungal infections of the CNS are uncommon in veterinary medicine. Cryptococcus is the most common fungal disease in cats and has a predilection for the CNS in both dogs and cats.

Abdominal and pleural fluids are most commonly submitted and thus will be the focus of this review, however synovial, cerebrospinal, and pericardial fluid analyses are also performed, particularly in referral practice settings. In healthy animals, there is very little fluid in the pleural space and abdominal cavity, with the exception of large animal species (e.g., the horse and cow), in which abdominal fluid can be readily collected from normal animals. Normal cavity fluids have very low protein content (2.5 g dl 21 ), as well as low nucleated cell counts. In dogs and cats, nucleated cells should be <1,000 cells ll 21 , however fluid from healthy horses can have up to 10,000 cells ll 21 . Cytologically, mononuclear cells (mesotheial cells, lymphocytes, and mononuclear phagocytes) predominate in normal small animal body cavity fluid. In contrast, normal body cavity fluid in the horse can demonstrate Diagnostic Cytopathology DOI 10.1002/dc more variability in nucleated cell differential, which can vary from mononuclear cell dominated to neutrophil dominated. Automated methods for cell counting have replaced manual ones, although microscopic differential cell counts remain the standard of care. 44 Categorization of effusions in veterinary medicine follows the transudate, modified transudate, and exudate scheme with similar specific categories (i.e., chylous, neoplastic, hemorrhagic, bilious, etc). 45 Sterile inflammatory exudates can be associated with pancreatitis in small animals, uroperitoneum, and bile peritonitis, the latter of which is most commonly seen in dogs. Cytologic evidence of bile is typically evident by the presence of yellow to green or blue/black pigment, however the presence of amorphous-to-fibrillar, basophilic mucinous material similar to \"white bile\" described in people can also be found in certain cases of canine bile peritonitis (Fig.  13 ). 46 Horses do not have gall bladders, limiting the significance of this condition in those species. Hemorrhagic effusions may be seen in cases of trauma or coagulopathy, although in older dogs, particularly those of predisposed breeds (e.g., German shepherds, golden retrievers, and boxers), ruptured hemangiosarcoma of the spleen or liver is considered an important differential diagnosis. Feline infectious peritonitis is a lethal immune-mediated disease associated with infection with a feline coronavirus. 47 The \"wet\" or effusive form of the disease results in very high protein (>8.0 g dL 21 ), straw-to-golden colored, hazy abdominal or thoracic effusion with moderate numbers of nucleated cells of inconsistent distribution. 47 In horses, abdominocentesis and cytologic fluid analysis are routinely performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation for any gastrointestinal disease (often generically referred to as \"colic\"). Septic inflammation may be associated with rupture of the gastrointestinal tract, although in peracute cases, which may lack significant inflammation, cytologic distinction from inadvertent enterocentesis is vital.",

As noted above, flow cytometry and molecular diagnostics can be of value in low cellularity samples or when cytologic features are not compellingly diagnostic. Carcinomatosis can be difficult to distinguish from severe reactive mesothelial hyperplasia because of overlap in the degree of cytologic atypia. 45 Mesothelioma has been reported in dogs, cats, and horses, but is rare and often cannot be reliably cytologically distinguished from carcinoma or severe mesothelial hyperplasia. Cytologically, owing to their morphologic overlap, it is often impossible to identify a tissue or origin (primary or metastatic) of a carcinoma cell population in a peritoneal or pleural fluid sample, with the potential exception of gastric squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in horses. Gastric SCC is the most common stomach tumor in horses and can exfoliate neoplastic squamous cells into cavity effusions through metastasis or erosion through the gastric wall. 48 ",
