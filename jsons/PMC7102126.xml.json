Although its incidence rate is increasing, with multiple outbreaks and significant morbidity, it remains an elusive diagnosis [2]. It is under national surveillance in Chile since 2002, but the scarce number of cases per year is probably explained because of underdiagnoses.",

Exposure is common among farmers and septic drain clean up crews. Symptoms usually begin 1 or 2 weeks after infection, and are characterized by fever accompanied by a broad spectrum of flu-like symptoms that can lead to extensive tissue damage, vasculitis, and multiorgan failure (Table 1).

In severe presentations, supportive therapies are essentials for survival, considering that multiorgan failure (MOF) is typically completely reversible [24]. Veno-venous ECMO provides immediate support of oxygenation and ventilation and helps ensure protective ventilation without further compromising oxygen delivery nor acid base balance [25]. In the case presented, profound septic shock, with MOF and catastrophic ARDS, made it impossible to ventilate the patient protectively and simultaneously supply adequate oxygenation and ventilation; thus, ECMO was initiated.",

This obese patient, with a body surface area of 2.3\u20132.4 m2 and an estimate required cardiac index of at least 4 L/min/m2, needs approximately 9 to 10 L min of oxygenated cardiac output. Initially, with only one oxygenator, ECMO flow was 6.6 L min, with a fully oxygenated blood (PaO2 after oxygenator of 105 mmHg); accordingly, even with no recirculation, this flow was insufficient to meet patient requirements. The addition of a second oxygenator allow us to increase oxygenated blood flow to 8 L/min, increasing oxygen delivery, and better meet patient oxygen demands (Table 3). In parallel we try to decrease oxygen consumption by decreasing the patient hyperdynamic state with high flow hemofiltration and temperature management. The need of double oxygenators in veno-venous ECMO is not frequently reported [27], but it could be highly useful as a strategy to reach adequate oxygen delivery (DO2) to surpass the patient VO2, thus stopping the oxygen debt and the shock vicious cycle.",
