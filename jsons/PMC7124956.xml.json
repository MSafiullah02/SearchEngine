Population-representative household surveys generally take many months of preparation and data collection [1]. Phone surveys are faster to conduct but have increasingly suffered from low response rates (typically well below 10% [2]), which can be a major source of bias even when extensive weighting adjustments are made [3]. In addition, unless they use interactive voice response (which tends to further decrease the response rate [4]), phone surveys require substantial human resources to conduct the interviews. Given these limitations, rapid online surveys, which demand minimal human resources (beyond those needed to design the questionnaire) and could reach large numbers of respondents in a short time frame, may be a valuable tool to assess (and monitor over time) knowledge and perceptions of an infectious disease in the midst of an outbreak.",

Following an informed consent form, the questionnaire asked participants about the cause, current state, and future development of the COVID-19 epidemic; the risk of a fatal disease course; knowledge of symptoms and recommended health care\u2013seeking behavior; measures to prevent an infection with SARS-CoV-2; and their perception of the risk posed by individuals of East-Asian ethnicity in their community. In order to investigate to what degree dis- and misinformation about COVID-19 has affected the general public\u2019s beliefs about the condition, participants were directly asked whether they believed several falsehoods listed on the WHO\u2019s \u201cmyth busters\u201d website [12], which the WHO selected because these myths were circulating on social media [13]. Specifically, the questionnaire asked whether receiving a letter or package from China poses a risk of infection and whether using hand dryers, rinsing your nose with saline, eating garlic, applying sesame oil to the skin, taking antibiotics, and vaccinating against pneumonia are effective in preventing a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The questionnaire was built using Qualtrics software. Participants had to answer a question to reach the next question. Numerical entry questions did not allow for nonsensical inputs (eg, percentage questions were restricted to inputs between 0 and 100).",

First, participants who took less than 2 minutes to complete the questionnaire were excluded from the analysis because this indicated random clicking. This resulted in the exclusion of 2 participants. Second, if some respondents used random clicking to obtain the US $1.50 reward as fast as possible, a bimodal distribution in the time taken to complete the survey might be expected (with one group clicking as fast as possible and one reading the questions). I, therefore, plotted a histogram of the time taken to complete the survey. Third, participants were asked, at the end of the questionnaire, whether they looked up any answers online (\u201cIt is natural to be tempted to look up the answer to a question, especially when it\u2019s only a click away.

In addition, a substantial proportion of participants appeared to believe that common surgical masks are highly effective in protecting the wearer from infection with SARS-CoV-2. Information campaigns may, therefore, want to emphasize the comparative effectiveness of common surgical masks versus other methods of prevention, particularly frequent and thorough handwashing and avoiding close contact with people who are sick. Lastly, it is important to note that while the general public appeared to be well informed about the common symptoms of COVID-19, over one-fourth of the participants selected a health care\u2013seeking option that could lead to further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Moving forward, information campaigns on COVID-19 may need to balance the messaging of two important facts about the COVID-19 epidemic that could be interpreted by the general public to stand in direct conflict with each other: (1) The case fatality rate of COVID-19 appears to be lower than that of other recent infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola infection [22], SARS [23], and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [23,24].

First, although the sample of participants is representative of the US and UK general population by age, sex, and ethnicity, and the distribution of participants by household income and education was similar to that in the US and UK general population, participants may still differ from the general population on a variety of other characteristics. These characteristics may be both correlated with their knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 as well as with their decision to participate in the study or to create a profile with Prolific. Second, the estimates of discrimination against individuals of East-Asian ethnicity may be an underestimation because some participants may not have wanted to volunteer their discriminating tendencies to themselves or the researcher. However, I, as the researcher, had no access to any identifying information about the research participants, and participants were reminded of this fact prior to answering the question. In addition, such social desirability bias has been found to be lower in online surveys than in telephone or in-person surveys [25,26]. Third, it was possible for participants to randomly click responses in order to devote the least amount of time to earn the US $1.50 reward. In my view, this issue is unlikely to have caused major bias in this study because (1) there was no evidence of a bimodal distribution in the time taken to complete the survey (Multimedia Appendix 1); (2) while it was physically possible to complete the survey in under 90 seconds when randomly clicking on responses, only 2 participants completed the survey in under 2 minutes; and (3) the monetary reward (US $1.50) was relatively small, and thus, for most participants, unlikely to be the main motivation for participating in the study. Lastly, it is possible that individuals looked up the answers to some of the questions online prior to answering, which may have biased the results. Participants were reminded of the importance not to look up answers online prior to taking the survey and were asked at the end of the survey (while being reassured that their payment is not influenced by whether they volunteer information on having looked up an answer online) which, if any, questions they searched for an answer online prior to responding.",
