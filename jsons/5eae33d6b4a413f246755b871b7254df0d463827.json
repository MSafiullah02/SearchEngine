Further investigation identified leakage from the pancreatic remnant when Polysorb\u2122 absorbable sutures were used to tie off the proximal pancreatic duct. This led to pancreatic fistulisation through the abdominal wall (Figure 4D).

            "text": ". However, despite surgical interventions PDAC patients have a very poor prognosis and it is clear that incorporation of additional therapeutic strategies is required for improving the therapeutic benefit of surgery. Unfortunately investigation of potential clinically relevant strategies in the surgical setting is limited by the lack of an easily adopted, immune competent murine model of resectable PDAC. Although Khunel and colleagues have previously developed a model that recapitulates human disease and can be successfully used to interrogate efficacy of surgery in combination with other treatment modalities 5,6 this approach does require specialized equipment and knowledge of in vivo electroporation which may not be broadly available. In contrast, we sought to investigate the validity of developing an orthotopic model that requires minimal specialized knowledge beyond surgical implantation/resection techniques and can be adapted for any widely available and well characterized cell type. Consistent with previous findings28 , we found that mice implanted with Pan02 cells develop tumors highly reminiscent of human PDAC within a relatively short time (15 to 20 days). In addition, these tumors can be resected early in disease pathogenesis, prior to visible peritoneal disease, without compromising splenic immune function. Notably, despite surgical resection of the primary tumor eventual outgrowth in both the pancreatic remnant and distant metastatic niches was evident at later time points in the majority of animals. This eventual relapse likely reflects early dissemination of tumor cells throughout the pancreatic remnant as has been previously noted in preclinical animal studies and the clinical setting. Intriguingly, while the clinical significance of spleen preservation in PDAC is disputable, the inability of spleen preservation in surgically resected animals to provide a significant long-term survival benefit in this model suggests that other factors may limit immune mediated recognition of tumor cells necessary for disease recurrence. Indeed, immune phenotyping of the tumor microenvironment revealed an accumulation of regulatory T cells within the primary tumor and in secondary lymphoid organs. Furthermore, the increased expression of PD1 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes may be indicative of a suppressed immune response to infiltrating tumor cells. Future studies aimed at investigating the potential role of immune subsets present at disease sites may help to clarify the role of these regulatory T cell population as well as that of the additional immune cell subsets (MDSCs and B cells) in disease recurrence. Indeed, the potential value of the current model in evaluating clinically relevant immune modulating therapies which may be combined with surgical resection was demonstrated with GVAX, a whole cell vaccine currently being explored in clinical trials 29 . Notably, we did not find a significant effect of combining neoadjuvant GVAX vaccination with surgical resection of the primary tumor despite a clear improvement in survival following treatment with GVAX alone.",
