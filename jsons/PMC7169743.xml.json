It is efficacious in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection among vulnerable children, Lassa fever, haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, Crimean\u2010Congo haemorrhagic fever, severe adenovirus infection in immunocompromised patients, and in combination with interferon\u20102b for hepatitis C infection. Because of its broad spectrum and low relative toxicity it is often tested on a compassionate basis for new and re\u2010emerging viral infections. Thus, it was used in several countries after the dramatic appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in East Asia, including Singapore and Canada. We performed a retrospective cohort study assessing the effectiveness of ribavirin use in our patients with SARS.",

Diagnosis of SARS was based on World Health Organization (2003) criteria at the time of the acute illness. The use of ribavirin was doctor\u2010dependent. Oral ribavirin was dosed at 1.2 g three times a day; intravenous ribavirin at 400 mg every 8 h for sicker patients and those who could not take it per os. Routes of administration varied depending on whether the patient could tolerate feeding. We collected data on demographics, presenting symptoms, signs and laboratory results on the day of admission.",

In the multivariate analysis, we used the Cox regression model to provide both crude and adjusted hazard ratios for use of ribavirin. The aim was to adjust for covariates distributed unevenly between the two groups, which may be related to outcome. Death was the primary outcome of interest. Cox regression analysis was used to compare the survival time between those on ribavirin and those who were not. Survival time is defined as the interval between date of onset and date of death. With the exception of three patients, we used 6 August 2003, when the last SARS patient was discharged from the hospital, as the date of last follow\u2010up for all patients who survived SARS. Three patients who were discharged alive after SARS subsequently died from other unrelated causes. Their survival time was thus defined as the interval between the date of onset and the date of the last known follow\u2010up at our hospital. Adjustments for known and possible confounders were done in stages, to highlight the incremental effect of these confounders on use of ribavirin. Data was analysed using stata version 6.0 software (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA), and all tests were conducted at the 5% level of significance.",

A total of 229 cases were available for analysis, of whom 97 (42.4%) patients received ribavirin. The use of ribavirin throughout the epidemic is represented in Figure 1. The mean starting point of ribavirin treatment was at 6.4 days after onset of illness. Treatment duration was for a mean of 5.6 days. We compared the results of clinical and laboratory investigations at the start of ribavirin treatment with correspondent parameters of patients who did not receive ribavirin on day 6 of illness. When clinical and laboratory results for the day were not available, results from the day before or after were used instead. Both groups shared similar characteristics on admission. The treatment group had fewer males, younger patients, with more symptoms of myalgia. The patients in this group had better oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry on admission compared with controls. Clinical and laboratory results taken at the start of ribavirin in the treatment group vs. day 5, 6 or 7 of illness of the control group were similar (Table 1). All but three patients had a positive serology result for SARS\u2010CoV. These three were diagnosed as probable SARS during hospitalization; none of them received ribavirin.",

Justification of its use came from previous experience with the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (Ning et al. 1998). Together with the use of steroids, the potential antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of ribavirin would appear appropriate for the proposed immunopathological damage in the second week of SARS (Peiris et al. 2003). However, its use is now challenged. No controlled studies are available, and in vitro evidence suggests that the drug has no activity against SARS\u2010CoV at the concentrations for ribavirin\u2010sensitive viruses (MMWR 2003).",

LDH has been well\u2010described as a predictor of severity of illness; hence, we used its levels to correct for the severity of illness at the start of ribavirin use. LDH levels at the start of ribavirin in the treatment group were compared against levels at day 5, 6 or 7 of illness of the control group, where the mean start date of ribavirin was on day 6.4 of illness. The hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% CI: 0.44\u20132.41, P = 0.939) associated with ribavirin after correcting for predictors of mortality, is in line with the Canadian study.

Different management practices in these two temporal groups would affect our interpretation of the results. Use of steroid (dosage and route) was different throughout the epidemic. There was also a change in treatment protocol. In our own hospital's unpublished analysis, we observed that overall survival outcomes improved in the later part of the epidemic, with fewer admitted to the ICU with lower APACHE scores.
