            "text": "Method: A study about the donorship was conducted using the reports from all regions of Russia followed by a computer statistical analysis. Findings: All the regulations for examination of donors and testing the donors blood are approved by the Russian Ministry of Health. Volume of whole-blood donation is determined by the physician examining the donor. A standard donation must not exceed 450 ml of whole blood. In first time donors, as well as in persons under 20 and over 55, standard donation must not exceed 300 ml. Nowadays an average single unit of blood donated is 393 ml. In 1888 amount of donors was 4 544 775 (voluntary donors: 96%), in 1999, 2 178 813 (voluntary donors: 82.6%); in 2002, 2 097 064 (voluntary donors: 87.5%). In 2002, 1 606 895 l of whole blood was collected, 75% of blood being given by voluntary donors. 4.5% of donors blood was discarded as defective because of HbsAg 16.3%, anti-HCV antibodies 26.7%, syphilis 8.6%, HIV antibodies 0.8%, elevated ALT level 30.5%, other causes 17.1%. Anti-HTLV determination does not prove its value, because the rate of the virus infection is low within Russia. Conclusion: Amount of donors has been decreased for the last 12 years. To provide the hospitals donors blood, components and preparations and to develop alternatives transfusion is actual national problem at present.",

            "text": "The most significant goal of IBTO is to supply and deliver safe and adequate blood and blood components for use in clinics. The best way ensuring to achieve this goal is to have the non-remunerated voluntary, trained and retained donors as regular donors. The research was designed to observe the society's perception about the blood safety and blood donation, whether or not some at risk individuals refer to blood transfusion centers to give their blood and whether they would be detected as ineligible donors by those centers. The analysis of 9000 participants in this research indicates that only 55% of the population under study were confident of services delivered by IBTO. It is worth mentioning that 32% of participants considered that blood donation is the best way to know if they have been infected with hepatitis. Notwithstanding this research, the total of 15% of blood donors have shown to have risk factors leading to their deferral from blood donation. These results show that IBTO through cooperation and collaboration with influential cultural centers and institutes, has to do more job on public confidence and has to meet new strategies for getting people more familiar with the services of IBTO. Due to missing the donation of blood by the 15% at risk groups with the risk of transmission of some blood-borne diseases during window period at the time of donation, IBTO has to put more efforts in recruiting, training, and retaining nonremunerated donors. Background: The prevalence of antibodies and VIH is 4.2% of 1995 to 2002 and that of HBS antigene is 11.8 % from November 2002 to January 2003. The actual preval-ence of antibodies VIH and HBS antigene is not established yet as well that of antibodies anti-VHC in the blood donors with of IME/Kimpese hospital. Methodology: This work analyzes the profile of the blood donors of IME hospital over a 12-month period going from November 2002 to October 2003. The collected parameters are category, age, sex, blood group, seroprevalence of antibodies anti-VIH, VHC and syphilis and HBS antigene of donor. Results: A total of 1305 blood donors were received category of donor. Category of donor: family (81.3%), voluntary (16.7%), paid (2%). Age: 20-45 years (86%); more than 45 years (12%), Less than 20 years (2%). Blood group: O (78%); A (13.8%); B (7.8%); AB (0.4%) Prevalence: VIH (7.6%); VCH (20.8%); Syphilis (0.9%); HBS antigene (14.3%). Discussion: In the Congolese rural area of Kimpese, the majority of the blood donors founds itself in the category of the family donors however while comparing with the proportion of 98.8% in 2001 in the case blood bank there is a reduction in this category to the profit voluntary donors (16.7%); this fact is due to the effort of sensitizing and recruitment undertaken since May 2003. Introduction: Internationally, blood services rely on strict donor selection and the application of sensitive blood tests to screen blood and protect the blood supply. This needs knowledge of the basic epidemiology of transmissible infections in the communities, education of potential donors and selection and maintenance of volunteers at low risk of blood transmissible infections. The blood bank at Fort Portal has done a serosurvey of markers of infection for HIV, Hep B and syphilis for different categories of donors who presented between 1997 and 2002. Methods: Prospective donors were given an educational talk with the option of selfdeferral and were then counseled individually. Blood of those who donated was screened for HIV, syphilis and HBsAg. Results: There were 40 144 blood donors, of which 25 650 were regular donors while 14 494 were new. The age range of the donors was 17-60 years (mean age: 21). 22 831 were school going, 17 313 from communities. HIV was 1.62%, hepatitis B 5.56% and syphilis 0.70% overall. HIV among school going was 0.99% and 2.15% for communities. HIV shows a downward trend (2.10-1.30%) Hepatitis has stagnated at 5-6%. Conclusion: School going children are the safest donors. HIV has shown a downward trend (18-6.1% c.f. general population 2.10-1.30%) attributable to successes in donor selection. These facts would help develop appropriate interventions in donor selection. Introduction: Autotransfusion programmes involve hope that part of autologous donors will thus augment the numbers of blood donors. The aim of the study is to evaluate the information effectiveness about autotransfusion; to find out what was patients' motivation to undergo autotransfusion; to estimate how many autologous donors would become homologous. Material and methods: The study comprised 382 autotransfusion patients (298 males). The questionnaire included six questions about the motivation factors to undergo autotransfusion, patients' attitude to blood donation and the haemovigilance. The statistical analysis was based on t-test. Results: The study revealed that, out of 382 autotransfusion patients, 96 (25.1%) were willing to donate blood regularly. Blood had been donated by 20.4% of the patients. The information obtained from a physician was insufficient for 17.8% of the patients, and 6.8% would not have had autotransfusion if there had not been a risk of infection. Almost half (48.9%) did not express their opinion about the haemovigilance, leaving this to experts. Conclusions: The analyses show that autotransfusion programmes might influence positively the number of blood donors. The motivating factor about autotransfusion is mainly the information from a physician. Patients seem to be significantly ignorant about the haemovigilance. There is a need for an educational programme on existing risk factors involved in blood transfusion and the methods to increase its safety. Aims: Every study about adverse effects (AEs) in blood donors could potentially be used to ameliorate donor comfort and safety. Materials and methods: During a half-year period (July 2002-December 2002) a total of 1625 whole-blood donors have been observed during the donation procedure and interviewed approximately 7 days after for AEs. The postdonation interview, by phone, was based on a questionnaire about precise general symptoms and arm problems. Results: Twenty-one percent of the donors had one or more AEs (17% of men vs. 41% of women). Repeat blood donors and occasional blood donors had fewer AEs than firsttime blood donors (17% vs. 17% vs. 39%). The most common arm findings were arm soreness (11.5%), numbness (7%) and hematoma (1.7%). The most common systemic AEs were fatigue (6%) and sleepiness (4.2%). However, only few blood donors had severe acute AEs: nausea and vomiting (0.5%) and vasovagal symptoms (0.2%). Conclusions: The postdonation interview seems to be an attractive supplementary method for searching AEs in blood donors and we believe that its application is feasible in all blood centers. The interview approach was a pleasant surprise for donors, improved any confidence feeling about blood services and strengthened donors' wish for offering. Background: One of the significant factors that determine first-time donors from becoming long-term donors is vasovagal reaction (VVR). The initial donation is a crucial and risky step and it may produce a mild or strong emotional reaction according to how the mind records the experience. The aims of this research are: (1) to understand why VVR happens during first donation; (2) to find an effective method of preventing VVR. Materials and methods: This research is based on the belief that psychological associations linked with blood donation are the main cause of VVR. In order to combat this it is necessary to create a close doctor-donor relationship based on attentiveness, acceptance and professional competence. Through only one initial interview prior to donation it is possible to interpret the donor's true needs and activate interior resources that allow the donor to cope. Results: In the experimental group of 63 donors no one had syncope and only seven exhibited sweating and paleness. In the control group of 35 donors, 27 had syncope, six suffered from vertigo-dizziness, sweating and paleness, and only two experienced no discomfort. Conclusion: Syncope during blood donation is a physical expression of emotions that can no longer be contained on a psychological level and are therefore transferred on to the body. We have demonstrated that a psychological interview prior to donation provides the donor with sound preparation, allowing them to contain their emotions and thus avoid VVR.",

Method: Following a literature review, an ethically approved questionnaire was conducted to two pilot groups, both consisting of ten donors who had donated stem cells during the last 3 years. Group 1 had been informed of patients' death via a letter, and group 2 via the telephone, followed up with a letter. Results: Results of this pilot demonstrated that 60% of group 1 would have preferred an initial telephone call and 90% of group 2 preferred the personal touch of the contact. Examples of donors' comments were: ''receiving a letter appeared cold, personal touch would be preferable'', ''a phone call would have helped, I could have asked more questions'', ''found personal touch reassuring''. WBMDR best practice guidelines currently include Stem Cell Donor Managers: (1) promoting continuity of care, (2) undertaking a formal counselling training, (3) break bad news via telephone, (4) assess whether face to face contact is required or offer the option of a follow up telephone call in a few days, and (5) Send a follow up letter confirming the information provided. To date 100 donors have completed the questionnaire and full results will be presented. Introduction: The collection of blood and blood components is in Germany limited to a maximum donation volume for women up to 1000 ml and for men up to 1500 ml erythrocytes. Despite following the guidelines of the B\u00c4 K, it is possible to exceed the allowed blood loss in case of multiple donations. Methods: Donor registration and donation procedure of 40 regular donors at the Institute for Transfusion Medicine, were recorded with the Vista Information System (VISTA TM ) The final donation volumes are typically composed of (1) draw of blood sample for testing (\u00b118 ml RBC), (2) residual volume of the tubing set with (\u00b130 ml RBC) and without blood-return procedure (\u00b195 ml RBC), and (3) donation type and product volume.

In contrast with the classical approach, MCD allows considerable increases in flexibility, productivity and an adequate supply of blood products. However, one should consider that not all combinations of MCD are economical attractive. Only collection procedures where at least one P-C is collected seem to be advantageous. MCD challenges more the preservation of the donor's safety than a single product donation does. Simultaneous donation of multiple blood components can lead to unintended high blood component losses, especially RBC-C. The actual guidelines on donor safety are therefore no longer sufficient neither satisfactory. Conclusion: Donor eligibility has to reflect the new ideas in MCD. It seems to make sense to adopt these criteria to the individual physiology of the donor. 'Post-donationoriented' donor limits and intervals that also take into consideration the total blood volume of the donor could be conceivable.",

The letter tells the donor that there is no problem with their health and asks them to give a sample in 6 months time (now changed to 3 months). The previous policy was not contacting the donors but to allow them to continue donation, automatically discard the units and refer a sample for testing. This was considered to be unethical. A recent incident with the syphilis screening assay allowed us to easily assess this method of donor contact. A change in assay meant that in a 6-month period approximately 850 extra false-positives were identified. An increase in the number of 'follow-up' samples was seen approximately 6 months after the increase in screen reactives. Unfortunately only an increase of 450 was seen, i.e. approximately half of false-positives appear to have been 'lost' to the transfusion service. Trima-automated blood collection system can collect platelets (PLT), plasma and packed red cells (RBC) . The aim of this study was to evaluate Cobe Trima in terms of efficiency, donor safety and acceptance. For that reason, healthy donors, preselected with regard to vein quality, completed a collection procedure on Trima. The average blood volume was 5.1 \u00b1 0.6 l, platelet count 304 \u00b1 47 \u00b7 10 9 l )1 , haematocrit (HCT) 42.9 \u00b1 2%. The following procedure targets were defined: PLT (3-6 \u00b7 10 11 ), RBC (286 ml), plasma (200 ml). Donor blood counts were performed immediately after the procedure. At the end of each collection, the donors were asked to answer questions designed to evaluate their opinions, side effects and readiness to repeat donation on Trima. Following collections, no significant alterations in donor haematological values were observed, apart from the expected decrease in platelet and HCT values. No serious adverse reactions occurred; minor citrate reactions and vein access problems were observed. Product targets were achieved in 94% of procedures. In answer to our questions, 81% of donors rated their experience as very positive, 12% as positive and 7% were neutral; 94% said they would donate on Trima again, mainly due to the convenient single-needle procedures with short run times. In conclusion, Cobe Trima was found effective in collecting multiple components, as well as safe and accepted by most donors. Objective: To determine the seroprevalence of HCV, HBV HDV infection among patients in haemodialysis centre. Material and Methods: 64 patients (pts) undergoing haemodialysis. All were transfused with blood. Lab records were used to retrieve the total number of blood transfusions received and serologic study results.

Results: There have been screened 125 156 blood units out of which 1552 were repeatable reactive (1.20%). During 1995-1999 the incidence decreased constantly from 2.16 to 0.84%; afterwards the incidence maintained between 0.68 and 0.80%. Conclusion: The introduction of anti-HCV mandatory testing led to the permanent deferral of a significant number of donors (initial, occasional and regular).

Materials and Methods: All donors who gave blood at the Hospital S. Jos\u00e9 between 01 January 1993 and 31 December 2003. Those anti-HCV positive were called to repeat analysis for hepatitis C virus and be submitted to a medical interview to identify risk factors associated with hepatitis C infection. Results: 82 414 blood donations were studied; 584 (0.07%) were found to be anti-HCV positive. Just 382 blood donors (65.4%) answered our call: 99 (26%) were found to be false-positive; 22 (3.7%) blood donors had a seroconversion since their last donation in our blood bank. There was no identified risk factor in 26.5% of those donors confirmed to be anti-HCV positive; 27.2% underwent a surgery, 22.3% had a history of drug addiction, 10.6% received a blood transfusion before 1990, 3.5% had tattoos or piercings, 5.6% confessed a risky sexual behaviour and 4.2% had a professional or family risk. In most cases of the seroconversion group, we could not identify any risk factor. Discussion/Conclusion: Today, intravenous drug addiction and high-risk sexual behaviour are the most frequently identified risk factors associated with HCV infection. In our study we observed a large number of cases without risk factors identified: could it be that there are hidden factors relevant to this, or that there are more risk factors than we are currently aware of?",

Material and Methods: The blood samples were collected at the time of blood donation. Tests were done by Abbot AxSYM system. Results and Discussion: Blood samples were collected from donors between the ages of 17 and 35. Donations from this group accounted for more than 80% of whole donations. We had 134 samples from first doors and 355 samples from repeat donors. 114 first donors (85.1%) and 310 repeat donors (87.3%) were CMV IgG reactive. CMV could cause serious morbidity and mortality in premature infants and immunocompromised patients. It was reported that CMV infection incidence was about 17% for children if the transfused seropositive blood has been stored for more than 24 h (J Med Virol., 1992) . As CMV-screened blood components are not available in blood centres here, leukocyte-depleted blood components which can significantly reduce posttransfusion CMV are recommended for those patients. For first donors, anti-HBs and HBsAg seropositive rates were 64.3 and 9%, respectively. For repeat donors, 70.4% of them were anti-HBs positive and no one was HBsAg reactive. The HBsAg-seropositive rate of first donors of this group was not significantly different from that of first donors of all ages. Whereas, the prevalence of HBV infection in this group is around 71% and it is lower than the announced data that 90% of adults were infected by HBV and 15-20% were carriers in Taiwan. Background: The use of NAT technology to screen blood donors became mandatory in Italy in July 2002, but the methodology had been introduced in a trial form during the previous year. In the same period, an EIA test to detect HCV-coreAg had also been introduced. The study was focused to collect epidemiological data on new direct HCV markers and to review the transfusion-transmitted viral residual risk. . 888 506 units were tested also for HIV RNA. Results: 6/1 906 659 cases were found only NAT positive for HCV RNA (incidence \u00bc 3.1/10) and 1/888 506 case for HIV RNA (incidence \u00bc 1.1/10 6 ). Discussion: Considering that in Italy, 2.5 million of haemocomponents are collected per year the introduction of NAT testing allows 10 units potentially infectious for HCV or HIV to be identified in 1 year and reduces the residual risk of transmitting HCV or HIV via transfusion to 0.5 and 1.1 units per million, respectively. In addition there was an initial reorganisation of biological validation of blood units due to centralisation of NAT testing in a smaller number of TS. Aims: To contribute to the reduction of HIV transmission by the blood transfusion and to improve the accessibility of population to a safe blood. Implementation: With the World Bank funds, the project was carried out from January 2002 to January 2003 by GTZ and the Health Ministry. The interventions were focused on: providing the blood safety supplies, recruitment of voluntary blood donors and training.",

            "text": "Parvovirus B19 (B19), an icosahedral, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus replicates in active dividing cells such as erythroid precursors. B19 can be transmitted by transplacental passage, by respiratory route and by transfusion (because its resistant to viral inactivation procedures). 4656 blood donors were screened for B19 antigen research, by a haemagglutination assay. Positive samples were tested for viral genome research by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 37 donors (0.79%) resulted reactive for B19 antigen, but only six of these (16.2%) were also positive at PCR. Our results suggest that the haemagglutination test has not a sufficient specificity; on the contrary, the contemporary positivity for DNA and antigen allow us to identify subjects affected with acute infection. Considering all donors, the acute infection had a frequency of 0.12% (equal to 1:776 donations). Nevertheless it's reported that B19 infection is common (>50% of general population shows anti-B19 antibodies), even if its frequency in the infectious phase is lower, therefore an economical evaluation of the test usable for screening is required. Although parvovirus infections are usually benign and selflimiting, symptomatic forms may be observed and it's important avoiding the viral transmission to pregnant woman, thalassemic or immunocompromised patients. In our opinion, a B19 antigen test could be proposed for a rapid, easy and not expansive screening, supported by PCR only on positive units. The result: The prevalence of HBsAg in blood donors is 7.5%. In voluntary donors the HBsAg prevalence is 6.9%, FDs 7.6%, FTDs 9.8% ( P > 0.10). Over the 3-year periods in voluntary donors the HBsAg prevalence ranged from 4.6 to 9%, in family replacement donors from 6.9 to 8 %, first-time donors from 3.1 to 14.2%. According to sex the HBsAg prevalence in men is 8.8% and women 4.6% (P < 0.005). Over the 3-year periods the prevalence in men has a decline tendency (9.7-8.3%) and increasing tendency in women (3.5-5.3%). According to age group the HBsAg is 11.4% in 17-29 age group, 8.2% in 30-39 age group, 6% in 40-49 age group, 4.6% in 50-60 age group. Conclusion: The higher HBsAg prevalence in blood donors explain with higher prevalence in general population. The decreasing HBsAg in blood donors explain with improved blood donors screening and selection method. Considering the quality of blood we always recommend for voluntary blood donations. Background: This study was undertaken to determine the risk of transfusion transmissible viral infections through transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products. Materials and Methods: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) screening was performed on 1500 consecutive blood donors. Results: 15/1500 (1%), 17/1500 (1.1%) and 7/1500 (0.5%) of donors had HIV, HBsAg and anti-HCV, respectively. 12/1500 (0.8%) had HIV-I infection, 2/1500 (0.1%) had HIV-2 while 1/1500 (0.07%) had dual HIV I and 2 infection. 2/1500 (0.1%) had co-infection of HIV and HBV. Males accounted for the highest infection burden for HBV 17/1481 (1.1%) and anti-HCV 7/1481 (0.1%) while female donors had the highest HIV prevalence 1/19 (5.3%). Commercial remunerated donors showed the highest HIV HBsAg and anti-HCV infection rates 9/651 (1.4%), 11/651 (1.7%) and 5/651 (0.8%), respectively. Conclusion: This study confirms a high prevalence of transfusion transmissible viral infections among blood donors. This calls for the immediate implementation of a mandatory universal donor screening policy for the exclusion of blood donors with surrogate markers for HIV, HBsAg and HCV infection, the setting up of a national blood transfusion service, run on the basis of voluntary non remunerated, low risk blood donors. About 50% of the general population and 90% of people infected with HIV carry CMV. In order CMV can attack several parts of the body in patients with weakened immune defence by HIV or another diseases, we evaluated IgM, IgG antibodies against CMV in HIV patients. We detected serumic IgM, IgG anti-CMV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay method (ELISA) in 30 HIV positive patients included 24 (80%) males and 6 (20%) females, aged between 20 and 53; 23 (76.6%) of them (all male) were drug addicted and 30 healthy blood donor HIV negative as control included 24 (80%) males and 6 (20%) females aged between 18 and 55 were selected. IgM anti-CMV antibody was presented in 7 (23.3%) patients, one of them (3.3%) was borderline (doubtful) and 22 (73.4%) were negative. IgG anti-CMV antibody was detected in all the patients and controls IgM antibody was not detected in controls. Our results showed a significant difference (P \u00bc 0.00) in IgM anti-CMV antibody between patients and controls. There was a correlation between IgM anti-CMV antibodies and HIV positivity (Phi \u00bc 0.874, P \u00bc 0.00). CMV is an important co-infection in patients with HIV infections. As CMV disease can damage many parts of the body, including GI tract, lungs and eyes, if it not treated; so detection of CMV antibody appears to be necessary in HIV positive patients.",

The public haemocentre network is the largest and most important system of blood collection and the procedures are uniform, following guidelines of the Ministry of Health. An ecological study was conducted to determine the geographical distribution of HTLV-I/I serologic screening prevalence rates in blood donors from large urban areas, from 1995 to 2000. Methods: Our data refer to the largest urban areas in each State (n \u00bc 27). About half of the Brazilian population live in these metropolitan areas. After passing predonation screening questionnaire and clinical examination, eligible donators are tested for HTLV-I/II, HIV-1/2, HBV, HCV, T. cruzi and T. pallidum. In Brazil, law forbids any reimbursement for blood donation. For HTLV-I/II, a donor is considered seropositive if his/her serum sample is positive on EIA and confirmed by Western blot. Results and Conclusion: From 1995 to 2000, 6 218 619 donors were EIA tested. There was important geographic heterogeneity between the mean HTLV-I/II prevalence rates, ranging from 0.4/1000 in South to a rate 25 times higher, 10.0/1000 in the Northeast. On average, the EIA prevalence rates are lower in the South with an increasing trend towards the North and Northeast. Further studies are needed to better understand the reason for the spatial heterogeneity of HTLV-I/II seroprevalence among blood donors in Brazil.

            "text": "Screening for HBsAg is currently the most widely used method to determine the presence of HBV. This is sometimes combined with screening for the presence of anti-HBc to exclude past HBV infections. Increased immunological pressure on HBsAg, either by immunisation programs or in chronically infected patients, is leading to the emergence of HBsAg variants. In designing the Hepanostika HBsAg Ultra we therefore selected a combination of antibodies able to detect all currently known HBsAg variants, including samples in which the common 'a'-determinant is severely affected. The assay specificity was evaluated with a total of 8000 samples, the analytical sensitivity was assessed with seroconversion samples and with the AFSSaPs standard.",

            "text": "Finally the assay design was tested with naturally occurring HBsAg variants, extended with recombinant HBsAg resembling published HBsAg variants. We found an excellent specificity of 99.9% and a sensitivity of less than 0.1 ng/ml. The sensitivity correlated well with the performance of the seroconversion panels tested. We found a better or equal performance compared to other commercial available screening assays. In the Hepanostika HBsAg Ultra all HBsAg variants were found positive while some of these samples were poorly or not reactive in the other HBsAg screening assays tested. The Hepanostika HBsAg Ultra is a highly sensitive, broadly reactive and specific HBsAg screening assay, highly suited to ensure the safety of the blood supply. The incidence of post-transfusion hepatitis has been reduced by blood donor screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but the HBV infection is still responsible for a certain cases of post-transfusion hepatitis. HBV DNA screening of blood donors would be able to reduce the preseroconversion window period. An extra sample was collected from 1000 HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV and RPR negative and three HBsAg positive blood donors. Every four samples were pooled and HBV DNA detected by PCR method. The sensitivity of the assay was estimated 300 geq/ml according to VQC proficiency panel. The specificity of the primer was characterised by alignment with Blast program. HBV DNA (PCR) was detected in 7 out of 1000 HBsAg negative and 3 HBsAg positive samples. Three out of seven were positive and four of them were negative for anti-HBc. All three anti-HBc positive and two anti-HBc negative donors were recalled after 1 year and they were negative for HBV DNA, HBsAg and anti-HBc. Two other anti-HBc negative donors were HBsAg negative after 6 months. So HBV infection was excluded in 1000 HBsAg negative blood donors. Iran is a country with an intermediate prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. With considering the lab design, test procedure and repeatedly positive samples, contamination in the lab (in this study) was lower than contamination in the sample collection step. Follow-up the HbsAg negative and HBV DNA (PCR) positive blood donors and sample collection precaution strongly recommended. Evaluation of an HCVcoreAg test system in a blood donor and individual patient population A Haikali, E Grouzi, I Panagou, E Tsitouras, K Tilidou and I Spiliotopoulou Transfusion Service, General Hospital KAT, Athens, Greece Aim: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of an HCVcoreAg ELISA test system among a healthy blood donor population, specimens from individual patients and a seroconversion panel of five samples given by ORTHO. Materials and Methods: 15 109 blood donations and 1240 individual patient samples were tested between April 2002 and December 2003 for the presence of HCVcore antigen using the ORTHO antibody to HCVcore Ag ELISA test system. Results: Among donor and patient population we detected 15 IR (initially reactive) samples. 7/15 (0.04%) samples were RR (repeatedly reactive) giving a specificity of 99.96%. When the neutralising HCVcoreAg test was performed, 3/7 RR samples were confirmed. These samples were also found to be reactive for anti-HCV antibodies. We were able to follow-up 2/3 confirmed samples (one donor and one patient sample) during the early seroconversion phase until HCVcoreAg be completely undetectable. The blood donor HCVcoreAg appearance was consistently declined during 2 months period (three follow-up samples) until it became completely undetectable. Regarding the patient sample, disappearance of detectable HCVcoreAg was observed after 4 months (four follow-up samples). The seroconversion panel investigation showed a high sensitivity rate for low viral load samples compared to the reference molecular technology. Conclusion: The HCVcoreAg test (ORTHO) showed a high specificity and sensitivity and it could be suitable for routine testing of blood donations. Introduction: South Africa has a high, growing HIV prevalence. NAT testing has not yet been implemented in South Africa due to the high cost. The aim of this study was to determine whether, using current screening technology, sample pooling could reduce costs while maintaining sensitivity. Materials and Methods: Four HIV seropositive donors where tested by a quantitative PCR to determine viral loads. These were diluted with negative pooled plasma to obtain viral loads from 25 to 1000 copies/ml. Each dilution was tested using a standard single test with Ampliscreen HIV 1 (ST), made into a pool of 5 (5P) and 16 (16P) with negative plasma and tested using the ultrasensitive Ampliscreen Two commercially available seroconversion panels were also included and tested neat as ST, 5P and 16P. Viral load was determined, using a quantitative PCR, on an FFP banked unit from a donor who subsequently tested positive for HIV antibodies. This sample was then tested using ST, 5P and 16P.",

            "text": "Conclusion: A pool of five with input volume of 200 ml per individual sample followed by ultracentrifugation is at least as sensitive as single sample testing. A pool of 16 with input volume of 67 ml per sample followed by ultracentrifugation is not as sensitive as single sample testing. Screening for HCV was first performed at The National Blood Centre in 1990. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits was used as the first line screening and all samples that were repeatedly reactive on EIA were then tested on strip immunoblot assay (SIA) to determine the presence of true antibody to HCV. The objective of this study was to correlate the SIA results with HCV RNA PCR, where all samples that were tested on SIA were also tested using PCR for HCV RNA detection. This is to assist in providing a clearer picture of the HCV status among these samples. A total of 675 samples were included in this study. Results: (1) From a total of 279 samples with RIBA-3 positive result, 251 (90%) were PCR positive. (2) Only 17 (11.2%) samples out of 152 samples of RIBA-3 indeterminate were PCR positive. (3) All 244 samples that were RIBA-3 negative (no bands) are also PCR negative, giving a 100% correlation between the two tests. Background: Our present in-house PCR testing method consists of centrifugation of primary samples at 3500\u00b7 g, pooling with Tecan pipetting robot, pool precentrifugation at 6000\u00b7 g to remove cellular debris, transfer of samples into new centrifugation tubes, high-speed centrifugation (1 h at 48 000\u00b7 g) for virus enrichment, virus extraction and real-time PCR. Material and Methods: Centrifugation force for primary samples was increased to 6000\u00b7 g thereby making pool precentrifugation superfluous. 100 pools were spiked and analysed for five viruses with both preparation methods. Results: Cycle threshold (Ct) of real-time PCR for HCV, HBV, HAV and Parvo virus B19 (P < 0.05) was significantly reduced in pools prepared with the new method (without pool precentrifugation) compared with the previous method. For HIV we could demonstrate a slightly (not significant) reduced Ct with the new method. Conclusion: We could demonstrate that the new method yielded comparable or better Ct values for all measured five viruses. The new method is cost-effective, because we saved time and material for the pool precentrifugation. Second, the new method may improve safety, because there is no longer a need for manually transferring the supernatants into new tubes, which may lead to mixing up of samples in very rare instances.

The 'NATSCREEN' quality control (QC) programme is run for donor screening laboratories in Australia and New Zealand performing nucleic acid screening with the Chiron TMA Multiplex assay. Materials and Methods: Participants were supplied with two commercial QC samples (VQC, The Netherlands). The positive QCs are secondary working reagents calibrated to the WHO International Standards for HIV and HCV. Samples were tested in every assay run and the results sent to the NRL through the NRL's on-line QC interface, EDCNet (www.nrlqa.net). Data were analysed and summary statistics presented in reports, accessed through the NRL website. Results: Between 01 September 2001 and 31 December 2003 participants submitted 29 000 QC results. Analysis of the data from the QC sample batch 004 (n \u00bc 11 772) showed that from 5615 assay runs, 13 (0.23%) were invalidated on the basis of a nonreactive QC sample. Interlaboratory precision ranged from 7.92 to 13.87% (HCV-SPY004) and 9.00 to 16.99% (HIVSPY004). Result accuracy was estimated by calculating bias, which highlighted luminometer-specific trends that were demonstrated graphically by EDCNet. Discussion: Analysis of the results of testing two commercial QC samples in the Chiron TMA Multiplex assay demonstrated acceptable precision and accuracy. Changes and trends in results allowed potential problems, such as the need to monitor luminometer performance, to be identified. Conclusions: Please provide author and affiliations.This is the first study reporting a real evaluation of RR to transfuse HCV/HIV-infected blood units after 2 years NAT screening in Piedmont. Incidence and prevalence rates in blood donors in Piedmont are comparable to those registered in northern Italy. In France, HCV and HIV-1 NAT screening has been performed since July 2001 using two systems: BIOMERIEUX -ROCHE diagnostics and Chiron blood testing. HBV NAT assays are now available for these two systems. However, routine Nuclisens extraction procedure, performed from 2 ml of pool sample allows only two Ampliscreen assays on the same eluate. A modification of Nuclisens procedure should be necessary to allow three amplifications simultaneously. We decided last year to evaluate the impact of the implementation of HBV NAT screening on the BIOMERIEUX -ROCHE diagnostics system. At first the output of the Nuclisens Extractor for HBV DNA was studied. Our results showed that the extraction output isn't proportional to the HBV DNA concentration, in particular for concentrations higher than 10 3 units/ml. Nevertheless, this is not a problem for HBV NAT testing as no false-negative result was observed. Next, pool volume used for extraction was increased from 2 ml to 3 and 4 ml, respectively, and the eluate volume from 60 to 90 ll in order to perform the three Ampliscreen assays (HCV, HIV-1 and HBV). Our inter-sites results showed that the pool volume can be increased to 3 or 4 ml without any technical problem and the eluate volume can be increased to 90 ll without significant loss of sensitivity. In conclusion on the BIOMERIEUX -ROCHE diagnostics NAT system, modification of the extraction allows the implementation of HBV NAT assay in addition to HCV, and HIV-1, from a single extraction. Aim: Tecan genesis robotic microplate processor (RMP) is a fully automated ELISA system. Before implementation for anti-CMV ELISA, the RMP was validated for correct sample and microplate identification, volume accuracy and precision, ease of use and producing correct results. Materials and Methods: The RMP consists of a robotic sampler with on board 37\u00b0C incubator, washer and reader. Microplates are moved around the worktable by the RoMa arm. Anti-CMV ELISA is currently performed using the Tecan RSP, Dynatech MRW plate washer and SLT plate reader with Medusa 2000 software (RSP). Parallel testing using the RSP and RMP and reproducibility studies to determine the inter-and intra-assay variation were performed. Results: Concordant CMV results were obtained with 654 samples on the RPM and RSP with an S/CO correlation of 0.85. Correlation for duplicate CMV testing on the RMP was 0.977 (n \u00bc 178) and 0.907 (n \u00bc 96) on the RSP. There was no sample misreads or failure. The accuracy and precision (CV%) for 10 ll were 0.75 and 2.068 and that for 100 ll were -1.009 and 0.347, respectively. The inter-and intra-assay variation (CV) for the in-house control tested 5 times in one microplate over 5 days was 10.57 and 5.77. Conclusions: The RMP is reliable with better reproducible results for anti-CMV testing. The user is trained to set up test protocols and once set up, the system is not difficult to use. It is a batch processor and the software is not flexible to allow continuous processing.",

There is evidence that conformational HCV epitopes are more immunoreactive and would assist in improving test sensitivity. Methods: We have designed an HCV antibody assay using a conformational protein NS3/4a and linear fusion proteins MEFA 7.1 and MEFA 7.2 that incorporate all immuno-dominant epitopes of HCV (core, E1, E2, NS3, NS4 and NS5). Results: NS3/4a purified under nondenaturating conditions retains enzymatic activity and can detect early seroconversion conformational antibodies better than the c33c antigen. The NS3/4a protein also cross-reacts with different genotype samples better than the c33c antigen. The combination of NS3/4a and MEFA 7.1 detected c33c and c22-3 early seroconversion panels 2.7 and 4.6 days earlier than the Abbott Prism and HCV 3.0, respectively. Although MEFA 7.1 is cleaved by NS3/4a the degraded MEFA 7.1 remains immunoreactive. To overcome this proteolysis all the NS3/4a cleavage sites were removed from MEFA 7.1 and the MEFA 7.2 antigen was generated. MEFA 7.2 has similar expression level as MEFA 7.1 and can be purified using the same procedure. We demonstrate that MEFA 7.2 has very little degradation in the presence of NS3/4a and preserves all epitopes contained in MEFA 7.1. Conclusion: The availability of new recombinant antigens may assist in the development of more sensitive blood screening tests for HCV. NAT for HCV and HIV, reducing the 'window period', has improved transfusion safety, but also other viruses (as HBV and PV-B19) may cause post-transfusion infections. Moreover HBsAg screening cannot individuate 'low-level' carriers, HbsAg-antiHBsAb complexes or HBV mutants. On the other hand, PV-B19 is resistant to viral inactivation procedures (both heat and solvent-detergent) and, thanks to its dimensions, may cross the filters used for haemofiltration. From March to June 2003, HBV-and PV-DNA research was performing by PCR in 3000 periodic blood donors (58.8% males and 41.2 females), aged 19-53. Eight donors resulted HBsAg positive, but only 3 of them were HBV-DNA positive too; while, in our population with high incidence of IgG anti-PV Ab, five subjects resulted PV-DNA positive. Our results demonstrate that HBV-DNA PCR, with actual limits of sensitivity, did not add anything to HBsAg screening. About",

The sensitivity of the assays for the detection of antibody to HCV is evaluated by the seroconversion panels like as Boston Biomedica, Inc. (BBI) panels. Materials and Methods: 17 anti-HCV ELISAs-3 evaluated by BBI seroconversion panels. PHV 205, PHV 905, PHV 906, PHV 908, and PHV 914 hepatitis C seroconversion BBI panels were used. Results: The results of the assays were compared by Ortho HCV 3.0 Enhanced SAVe as WHO method that recommended in Report 1, January 2001. Relative seroconversion sensitivity index for each assay was calculated and evaluated 0 to +20. Discussion: The positive score for an assay showed less sensitivity than Ortho HCV 3.0 as reference assay in seroconversion panels. In this study only one assay was sensitive as Ortho HCV 3.0 and other assays were less sensitive than the reference assay with relative seroconversion sensitivity index +1 to +20. Background: Although blood centres testing for viral targets typically require a qualitative 'positive/negative' answer from laboratory tests, added value may be obtained by simultaneously providing quantitative information using a blood screening assay capable of quantifying the amount of West Nile Virus (WNV) RNA. During DNA synthesis, TaqMan chemistry will result in detectable fluorescence in a dose-dependent fashion, and can thus be used to determine the titre of viral RNA in a sample. Materials and Methods: A calibration curve is generated by TaqMan PCR from a panel consisting of WNV RNA at known input copy numbers. The amplification cycle at which probe degradation products are first detected (the C T value) is plotted against the log input copy number for each panel member and a linear calibration curve is obtained. The C T value from an unknown sample is then used to determine the amount of viral RNA present. An internal quantitation standard is included in each reaction.",

HTLV-I/II is endemic in Brazil, with prevalences ranging from 0.04 to 1% in blood donors and screening (EIA, confirmed by WB) is mandatory since 1993. WB indeterminate results are frequent and need better understanding, due to donor counselling and deferment policies. As part of the ongoing HTLV cohort study (GIPH) at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Hemominas, blood donors with abnormal serological results are re-tested every 2 years. The band patterns and epidemiological features of 20/230 with initial HTLV-I/II WB indeterminate results who later presented seroconversion were analysed. All 20 individuals converted to HTLV-I; none had HTLV-II bands. WB band patterns varied among indeterminate subjects, but p19 and p24 were detected respectively in 12/20 (60%) and 8/20 (40%), previous to seroconversion, not different from the nonseroconverters. Bands of low intensity ('weak bands') of precursors of gp21 were found in 12/20 (60%) (P < 0.001, when compared with nonseroconverters). The risk factors identified in the 20 individuals were: positive family member (35%), blood transfusion (25%), illegal drug use (15%), risky sexual behaviour (30%). In four cases (20%) there were no detectable risk factors for HTLV infection. Although most seroindeterminate donors are probably not infected with HTLV, delayed seroconversion makes counselling difficult in this population. The seroconversion rate must be considered and long-term studies are necessary to determine the meaning of HTLV seroindeterminates.",

            "text": "A number of factors are leading to an increased incidence of malaria in areas declared free of infection such as Oman. Since 1998 no indigenous cases recorded. However malaria continues to be an important health problem due to the importation of cases from endemic areas. In Oman risk of transfusion malaria is maintained at low levels by a policy of careful questioning about donor travel history. Aim is to assess the need and usefulness of donor screening for malaria as an adjunct to travel history taking into account the success of Malaria Eradication Programme in containing malaria. Over a period from November 01 till July 03 a total of 24 276 blood donors at the Central Blood Bank, Muscat, were tested for malarial parasites using the rapid immunochromatographic test AMRAD's ICT malaria P.f/P.v. Over the study period only four donors were found ICT positive. Donor details were send to the DEH&ME, Muscat, where donors were called upon and fresh sample taken, tested on thick and thin smears at regular time intervals. All four reported negative and none gave history of any risk of malaria exposure. Neither the current exclusion criteria nor serological testing can give an absolute guarantee against malarial transmission by transfusion. However a system incorporating the selection of donors with any possible risk of malaria exposure with subsequent testing by serological methodology would retrieve a substantial number of units without distracting from the current safety of blood supply. The blood separation method with use of centrifugal forces is most widespread. Specificity of this method is based only on very small differences of the density of blood components. Therefore efficiency of method is limited. For different blood components the ratio of their electrical charge to mass is another parameter that can be used with the purpose of blood separation. However workable process of direct electrostatic blood fractionating is difficultly achievable, as blood is highly conducting fluid and depth of electrostatic field penetration in blood is small. Such electrostatic separation can occur in very thin layers only close to electrodes. The effects of electrochemical decomposition of blood and electrode polarisation also complicate the use of electrical fields. The application of electrical fields for the blood separation requires to form strong electrical fields with deep uniform penetration in separated blood. We have developed alternative method and devices for electrostatic blood separation. During separation the blood slowly circulates in powerful constant magnetic field, travelling or rotating with high speed. So each blood component is exposed to action of Lorentz force. Discussed process of blood separation is extremely high-performance, as the powerful uniform electrical field arises in all depth of separated blood simultaneously, at the same time the blood can move slowly arbitrarily and there are no electrode effects in the absence of electrodes. Increasingly stringent donor selection criteria and testing algorithms threaten to reduce the donor base in the UK. Automated collection of multiple components offers the potential to increase production despite a shrinking donor pool. We therefore evaluated the ability of the Baxter ALYX to collect a double dose of red cells from selected donors. 16 plateletpheresis donors who fulfilled Council of Europe criteria for double red cell donation were recruited. The aim was to collect 360 ml of RBCs. SAG-M was added in the ratio 1:2.1. The final product was filtered through an Asahi filter and split into bags A and B. Both bags were sampled on days 1 and 42. Bag A was additionally sampled at days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. 15 procedures were completed in a mean (\u00b1SD) time 24 \u00b1 1.8 min. One was aborted due to haematoma formation. The volume of RBCs collected was 361 \u00b1 1.1 ml with Hb content in Bag A vs. Bag B of 54.0 \u00b1 0.9 vs. 52.9 \u00b1 1.1 g per unit. Hct was 56.6 vs. 56.1%. All units were leucodepleted to <10 6 WBC per unit and bacterial screening was negative. K + , Na + , pH, pO 2 , pCO 2 , glucose and lactate were all acceptable during storage. Haemolysis at day 42 was 0.22 vs. 0.23%. The procedure was well tolerated and staff found the machine easy to operate. All donors expressed the wish to donate on the ALYX again. ALYX can effectively and safely collect double dose RBCs from selected donors and should be considered as part of the strategy to augment supply in the face of donor attrition.",

Methods: Whole blood was filtered within 6 h of collection at an ambient temperature (10-22\u00b0C). Samples were taken pre-and post-filtration for analysis of WBC numbers, coagulation factors and complement activation (n \u00bc 8 for each type of filter). Results: All filtered units (232-267 ml) contained <2.5 \u00b7 10 6 residual leucocytes. No significant difference between group A and B. But group B seems take longer time to filtration than group A (5\u00a234\u00a2\u00a2 vs. 4\u00a212\u00a2\u00a2). Neither group A nor group B shows statistically significant losses of total protein, album, IgG, IgM, fibrin, factors VIII, IX, VWF and C3 (P > 0.05). Factor V, XI and AT-III decreased significantly in two group filters. Group B showed more significant losses IgA content and factor V activity (6.0%, 35.1%) than group A (1.7%, 12.6%). It appeared to be related to the lower wet ability and positively charged surface of group B filters.

The Optilink system is connected to each Optipress and records operator, donation number, processing protocol, time taken and gross weights of the prepared components. This system also allows database interrogation, which assists in managing the process and identifying training needs. Problems experienced with Optipresses include kinks in the tubing of the red cell transfer pack line leading to red cells running over into the plasma pack (run over). Kinks in the plasma line would lead to plasma running into the red cell transfer pack (run dry). Introducing the Optilink system reduced some losses due to these faults (Table 1 ) which may be explained by the process requiring operator identification, requiring slightly more time. A major benefit is that operators can be identified and retraining provided as appropriate. The introduction of updated software for all Optipresses in May 2002 also reduced the number of losses.",

We were interested in the influence on platelet activation of three different storage media in PCs thus prepared: autologous plasma, Composol (Fresenius Hemocare) and T-Sol (Baxter). Materials and methods: Five BCs are pooled with additive solution into a ring-shaped container. Subsequently, this ring is centrifuged and the PC is transferred into a new bag. We measured the percentage CD62-positive platelets by flowcytometry on day 1, 4 and 7 during storage. We also determined responsiveness of the platelets (expressed as %CD62-positive after activation with a thrombin analogue). Results: Platelets in T-sol have a significantly higher percentage of CD62-positive platelets on day 1 before activation. After activation, on day 1 and during storage, platelets in T-sol remain the least responsive. Also PCs in Composol are significantly less responsive than PCs stored in autologous plasma (P < 0.01).",

Background: CT Galicia has an important automated blood collection (ABC) activity, our ABC strategy combines high productivity with short procedure times. In October 2002 we upgraded our Trima's (V 4.2) towards TA. We evaluate during 1 year the productivity, procedure times (Times) and inter-satellite centre (SC) variability for TA. Materials and methods: A total of 4339 ABC were performed in seven SC. Collection focus was to collect platelet (PLT), plasma (PLM) and red blood cells (RBC) in maximum number of ABC, target average Time was 60 min. We compared productivity results for all seven SC with results of the individual SC to evaluate inter-SC variability. Transfusion dose (TD) is defined as: PLT \u00bc 3.5 \u00b7 10 11 , PLM \u00bc 210 ml, RBC \u00bc 225 ml -80% HCT. Results: Constant high productivity was shown for all SC, inter-SC variability is good with exception for number of ABC by TA/day. The SC with highest productivity performs 97% more ABC by TA/day than the SC with lowest productivity which results in a difference of 90% in TD by TA/day between both.",

The flow influences the filter performance. The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a filter for the leukocyte reduction of pooled PC obtained from PRP. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of storing platelets in PAS-III M without agitation. Two concentrations of platelets were used. Four identical platelet concentrates (W, X, Y and Z) were prepared from pooled buffy coats and stored in 30% plasma, 70% PAS-III M. Volumes were approximately 350 ml with platelet counts of approximately 600 \u00b7 10 6 /ml (W and Y) or approximately 200 ml with counts of approximately 1350 \u00b7 10 6 /ml (X and Z). Y and Z were agitated continually. W and X were not agitated until day 6 of storage. In total, four primary pools were prepared. P-selectin and CD63 expression indicate platelet activation. At day 7, X showed the highest levels (68.4 \u00b1 7.2%, 19.3 \u00b1 8.3%, respectively). Unit X also showed the greatest increase in soluble p-selectin levels (57.9 \u00b1 28.5 ng/ml day 1, 112 \u00b1 27 day 5, 161 \u00b1 45 day 7), the highest level of annexin V binding (34.8 \u00b1 22.5% day 7) and the lowest % extent of shape change at day 7 (4.6 \u00b1 4.6%). Lysis, demonstrated by soluble annexin V, showed an increase in all units but was greatest in X and Z. Mitochondrial membrane potential showed no statistically significant difference between the units at day 7. The higher platelet count gave both increased lysis, even with agitation, and a decrease in the extent of shape change. The combination of higher count and lack of agitation produced the greatest effect on activation and in vitro function. Lack of agitation for 5 days resulted in a poorer product. However, shorter interruptions may be acceptable. Aim: To investigate of correlation intergroup variations of the platelet count, morphological, functional recovery and surface antigen expression. Material and methods: Platelet concentrates were examined before and after uncontrolled-rate and our own controlled-rate cryopreservation (using 6% DMSO). The platelet count was determinated by Technicon H-3. Morphological score of platelets (MSP) was examined using phasecontrast microscope. Cell functions were estimated using hypotonic shock response and aggregation with ADP. Surface antigens were investigated by monoclonal antibodies anti-CD41 (Serotec), anti-CD42b, anti-CD62p, anti-CD63 (CLB), and Annexin V-FITC (Roche), using Epics XL.",

The aim of our study was to estimate the quality of three components (platelet concentrates PCs, red blood ceels RBCs and plasma FFP) collected within apheresis procedure which were intended to collect all this components during one apheresis procedure. Products were processed with blood collection separator Trima (Gambro). Platelets count, leukocytes count, hypotonic shock, expression of CD42b and CD62 antigens were studied in platelet concentrates. Erythrocytes count, platelets count, leukocytes count, hematocrit, hemoglobin and percent of hemolysis were studied in red blood cells. Platelets, erythrocytes and leukocytes counts were studied in plasma. We obtained: PCs with yield 3-7 \u00b7 10 11 platelets/U; RBCs units with 284 \u00b1 5 ml volume and 64 \u00b1 2% hematocrit and plasma units with 200 ml volume. We didn't observe significant change in pH of RBCs and PCs during storage. Percentage of hemolysis in RBCs didn't extend 0.4% in last day of storage. We also did not observe significant differentiation in expression of antigens during storage in PCs. All products were leukodepleted e.g. they had <1 \u00b7 10 6 leukocytes/U. Blood collection separator Trima is a simple, easy to use apparatus. We can obtain any combination of three products from one donor using Trima.

A sample was removed from each product for testing on day 1, day 5 and day 7. The platelet rich plasma (PRP) was diluted with platelet poor plasma (PPP) to a count of 300 \u00b7 10 9 /l. Both the PRP and PPP samples were studied. Either 330 ml of PRP or PPP were placed in the TEG cups and 20 ml CaCl 2 (25 mm) added. Purpose: The significance of an autologous blood donation program for patients planning hepatic surgery was compared between the two periods, i.e. before-and-after the initiation of this programme. Methods: First, whole blood [ 0.1 \u00b7 BV \u00b7 Ht/(1-Ht)] was drawn. Autologous plasma ( 0.1 \u00b7 BV \u00b7 Ht) was separated from it by gentle centrifugation and red blood cells were reinfused to the patient. Second, whole blood ( 0.1 \u00b7 BV) was drawn again, centrifuged, and autologous plasma ( 0.1 \u00b7 BV \u00b7 (1-Ht)) was obtained. Concentrated red cells ( 0.1 \u00b7 BV \u00b7 Ht) were stored in a refrigerator at 4? and plasma ( + \u00bc 0.1 \u00b7 BV) was frozen at )40\u00b0C.

Mean C3a, at 18 months, was 903 (422-1707), 439 (156-1271), and 482 (4-1964) ng/ml in Rev F, Rev G, and HSC, and mean C5a was 9.8 (0.92-39), 20.2 (6-35), and 12.5 (0.8-27) ng/ml, respectively. Conclusion: Significantly less (P < 0.0001) C3a in plasma from the three PCS2 centrifugal and the FC membrane apheresis procedures than from Auto-C membrane apheresis. C5a similar in Auto-C and FC, and more than in Revs F&G, and HSC. Differences in biocompatibility of apheresis procedures may influence complement activation. Impact on tolerance of transfusion plasma and quality of plasma for pathogen reduction treatment or fractionation should be considered. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a concentrated immunoglobulin purified from large pools of donor plasma. Depending on the protocols of the manufacturers, some do not include screening tests for the human T-lymphocyte viruses (HTLV-I/II) on plasmapheresis donors. IVIG blocks the reticuloendothelial system and it has been used to treat many immune disorders including neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT).",

Prior to elective delivery, maternal platelets were collected. In both women, the results of the pre-donation ELISA screening test for anti-HTLV-I/II were positive. The confirmatory western blot was found to be negative in one and indeterminate in the other. According to Health Canada regulations, both women were ineligible for directed blood donation to their newborns. However, subsequent repeat testing for anti-HTLV-I/II by ELISA >3 months after each delivery were negative. Thus, it is likely that the anti-HTLV-I/II antibodies (Ab) detected were passively acquired from the IVIG infusion. Passive transfer of Ab against syphilis, hepatitis A and B, cytomegalovirus, and HIV (before 1989) following the IVIG therapy has previously been reported. These two cases represent the first report of the passive acquisition of anti-HTLV-I/II Ab through IVIG infusion.",

This study aimed to develop the quantitative PCR method for removal validation of HCV from plasma-derived products. The standard for quantification was established from high titer of HCV RNA positive plasma, assigned an 5.9 \u00b7 10 6 IU/ml of HCV RNA. The nested RT-PCR was performed after extraction viral RNA by QIAamp viral RNA isolation kit. The first round of PCR was done by GeneAmp PCR System 9700 TM and for the amplicons were amplified by LightCycler TM to quantify HCV RNA. Several quantitative PCR conditions such as annealing temperature, MgCl 2 concentration, and primer concentrations were optimized. The linearity was conserved with the diluted series of the quantitative standard ranging from 5.9 \u00b7 10 4 to 5.9 \u00b7 10 2 IU/ml. The coefficients of variation values of the inter-and intra-assay reproducibility were 6.61 and 0.79%, respectively. Coagulation factor spiked with HCV RNA positive plasma was filtered with viresolve NFP filter and the reduction factor was 4.63. With this system, it was concluded that this system could provide a high level of confidence and cost saving step as a tool of HCV removal validation in the plasmaderived products. Rabies immunoglobulin is a liquid-or freeze-dried preparation containing human immunoglobulins, mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG). On the basis of the quality control procedures, Distribution of molecular size test item was chosen for the stability test being sensitive enough to indicate alterations of the preparation during the shelf-life period. Samples stored at 2-8\u00b0C for up to expired date .The lots tested were formulated with the container-closure system for marketing. The basic principle of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is that molecules are partitioned between solvent and a stationary phase of defined porosity. The larger molecules are excluded from the stationary phase and therefore elute first the column. The acceptable criterion for the sum areas of polymer and aggregates in this preparation is not more than 5% of the total area of the chromatogram. So, high level of Polymers and aggregates in bio-molecules which are used clinically can raise the incidence of allergic reaction including sever anaphylactic shook in the patients. In this study, the level of polymers and aggregates in 20 batches of local and imported rabies immunoglobulin were measured by using SCE with HPLC system. The results shows that the percent of the total area related to polymer and aggregates are significantly variable during the shelf-life period. There is no difference between local and imported products. Mannan-binding protein (MBP) is an acute phase protein, which activates complement through the so-called lectin pathway. Lectin pathway of activation is initiated by binding of MBP to repeating carbohydrate moieties. It is a C-type lectin which preferably interacts with mannose and N-acetylglucosamine residues. MBP is physically associated with two serine proteases, MASP-1 and -2, their activity being regulated primarily by the a 2 macroglobulin (a 2M Abstracts 121 blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and across the placenta from the mother to the fetus. Antibodies to T. gondii may persist in the serum at high titer for years. Sera from 50 patients suspected to toxoplasmosis (32 females and 18 males) were collected for detecting toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies by ELISA technique and toxoplasma antibodies by IF (immunoflouresence) with total anti-human immunoglobulins Sera from 50 patient's sera tested for toxoplasma IgG antibody (by ELISA) and IF method, 35 (70%) sera were positive. Frequency of toxoplasma IgG positivity in female (78.1%) is higher than male (55.6%), but this difference is not significant (P \u00bc 0.089). Eighteen patients (36%) were positive for toxoplasma IgM antibody, which is significantly different from controls (P < 0.05). There is good correlation between ELISA results for IgG antibodies with IF results. Our result showed there is a good relationship between IF and ELISA results for detecting IgG antibody. Unfortunately we did not detect IgM antibody by IF technique .It is suggested for detection of IgM antibody the ELISA method is preferred because of its greater sensitivity.",

CMVIG was stimulating for its further application, together with the efforts to start i.v. CMVIG production. Cytostatic/radiation injuries of blood-forming organs are main reason to stop successful cytostatic or X-ray therapy in cancer patients. The uninterrupted active proliferation of bone marrow cell precursors considerably increases the probability of irreversible cytostatic injuries, including dangerous mutations. Method of temporary inhibition of proliferation during system cytostatic or X-ray therapy in cancer patients is discussed. Such preventive temporary inhibition of proliferation in bone marrow allows practically to exclude irreversible cytostatic or X-ray injuries of blood-forming organs. Several sessions of autohemotransfusion with consecutive plasma reinfusions plus stepwise cryoconservations of the viable blood cells should be carried out 1-2 weeks before cytostatic therapy. It is necessary to carry out complete final reinfusion only after the sufficient accumulation of red + white blood cells, and platelets, and the day before of short-term session of high-dose cytostatic therapy. As a rule, the negative feedback in blood-forming system supports the concentration of blood cells extremely high-precisely. The sudden final reinfusion of superfluous amount of the viable cells causes substantial cell concentrating of blood and stops temporarily the proliferation of bone marrow cell precursors. Offered approach is preventive and allows considerably to reduce irreversible injuries in granulocyte branch of the blood-forming, and protection of red blood branch and platelet system. Background: The greater number of cells can be collected by leukapheresis from donors primed with G-CSF and higher cell doses administered. The aim of the study is presentation of granulocyte collection results from G-CSF stimulated donors. Materials and methods: Family members (n \u00bc 10) were stimulated with the G-CSF 5 mg/kg of body weight s.c. in single dose, 24 h before collection. The unstimulated group was community donors (n \u00bc 10) who received dexamethason 8 mg i.v. Leukapheresis were performed on CS-3000 plus. The Dextran 70 000 and the Na citrate were used in collection procedure. Cells were counted on CELL-DYN 3200 (Abbott). Results were statistically compared using Student's t-test. Results: Stimulated donors: PMN 30.7 \u00b1 8.1 \u00b7 10e9/l; Yield 40.23 \u00b1 6.42 \u00b7 10e9. Unstimulated donors: PMN 3.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b7 10e9/l; Yield 16.02 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b7 10e9.The differences between groups were statistically significant (P < 0.01). Mean cell dosis was 2.48 \u00b7 10e10/m 2 for the patients that received granulocyte concentrates from stimulated donors and 0.98 \u00b7 10e10/m 2 for patients that received granulocyte concentrates from unstimulated donors. Conclusion: Granulocyte concentrates obtained from donors primed with G-CSF contain a larger number of collected granulocytes, which are clinically efficacious and well tolerated by recipients. The treatment of leukaemia with chemotherapeutic agents is coupled with severe side effects. Therefore, it is of great importance to deliver the drugs directly to the target cells. The aim of our project is to investigate human erythrocyte ghosts as a drugdelivery system for cyclophosphamide (CP). The permeability of molecules and the kinetics of phagocytosis of ghosts was investigated to analyse the efficiency of the drug release in dependence on the preparation. Human erythrocyte ghosts were obtained by hypotonic haemolysis, incubated at different temperatures with fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled human serum albumin (FITC-HSA) and investigated by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy. Phagotests (Orpegene) were performed with FITC-HSA loaded ghosts and analysed by means of a FAC scan. The preparation of erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C results in permeable ghosts. Increasing the temperature to 37\u00b0C we obtained ghosts, which were impermeable for FITC-HSA and for carboxy fluorescein. The resealing at 37\u00b0C is irreversible. The rate of phagocytosis is dependent on the preparation, which influences the ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylserine. We use the anticancer drug CP as a model substance. It is a prodrug activated by the cytochrome P450 2B6. It was shown that substances can be incorporated into the ghosts and these are eliminated by the monocyte-macrophage system. The preparation of ghosts enables to optimize the cytotoxic activity of this drug-delivery system.",

Materials and methods: Immature DC (iDC) were produced by stimulating adherent peripheral blood leukocytes (PBMC) from 30 healthy donors with GM-CSF and IL4 for 7 days. The yield of iDC production was similar for all donors and ranged from 15 to 100 \u00b7 10 6 cells. Maturation of these iDC was induced by overnight stimulation with CD4O-L. Results: iDC expressed high levels of CD86, HLA-I but low or undetectable levels of HLA-II, CD40 and CD80. In contrast, mDC further up-regulated HLA-I and CD86 and expressed high amounts of HLA-II, CD40 and CD80. mDC were tested for their capacity to stimulate an allogeneic T-cell response. mDC strongly stimulated proliferation of allogeneic T-cells in a dose-dependent manner. T-cell proliferation was observed even at a T/DC ratio of 1/1000. Moreover, mDC-activated naive antigen-specific T-cells. In fact, mDC from HLA-A0201 donors loaded with the HLA-A0201 bound MELAN/A peptide (ELAGIGILTV) induced specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes after two rounds of in vitro stimulation as assessed by tetramer staining, intracellular IFN staining and cytotoxic assay. Conclusion: The m DC may be used in the induction of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes with different cancer peptides and could proceed, in this way, in anticancer therapy.

In two patients PDN total dose tapering was achieved and three did not require PDN all along the study period. EDSS did not worsen in four of the five patients. MS activity evaluated by means of MRI was reduced compared to the pre-ECP period. Conclusions: We observed a decrease in the number of relapses, EDSS stabilized in 80% of the patients. Similar findings were observed as to the occurrence of new cerebral lesions in MRI after gadolinium enhancement. A prospective multicenter study is now required to assess the possible usefulness of ECP in the treatment of RR-MS. In addition to antileukaemic effect of myeloablative regimens, allogeneic bone marrow (BMT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) result also in antileukaemic effect caused by 'graft vs. leukaemia' (GvL) effect. The finding of reduced relapse rates in allogeneic HSCT patients with graft vs. host disease (GvHD) and high relapse rates in syngeneic transplants, first indicated that the curative potential of HSCT may not be due to the eradication of malignancy by haemotherapy, but also the GvL effect. Finding that T-lymphocyte depletion for the prevention of acute GvHD resulted in increased leukaemia relapse risk, led to the usage of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in patients with relapse of leukaemia after allogeneic transplantation. Usage of reduced intensity conditional regimens (RCI) results in minimising of transplant related mortality but enables strong and potent GvL effect. DLI induce a complete remission in about 70-80% patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia and in 20-30% with acute myeloblastic leukaemia patients. Reduced intensity conditioning regimen with DLI is potentially curative for several haematological malignancies and at the same time decreases the risk of transplant related morbidity. Background: There are several methods for antibody identification. We developed a new potentiator -GLISS, a hypotonic buffered low ionic strength solution with glycine (Sigma, USA) prepared in house for antibody identification. The purpose of this study was to compare the tube technique by PEG-IAT and GLISS for antibody identification. Methods: We performed antibody identification using tube test technique by PEG-IAT and GLISS on 77 frozen samples of our inventory with known antibodies previously identified by association of techniques: gel test, LISS-IAT, PEG-IAT and enzyme treated red blood cells panels (Gamma Biologicals Inc., USA). PEG-IAT by tube test technique was performed as described elsewhere. Fifty microliters of 3% red blood cells suspension panel (ASEM, Brazil) was dispensed in each tube with 100 ll of serum and 100 ll of GLISS followed by reading after 15 minutes incubation at 37\u00b0C. The tubes were washed three times with saline and 100 ll of anti-IgG (ASEM, Brazil) were added. Following centrifugation, the tubes were observed for agglutination and hemolysis.",

The less altered was the B group, followed by AB, A and O groups in this order. With spiked samples, anti-HbF method significantly underestimated FMH volume compared to the target volume. Both anti-D methods gave results close to target value and addition of anti-D Ig made no significant difference. As expected, KT gave a wide variation in volume compared to FC methods. There are several explanations for the contradictory results between clinical and spiked samples for anti-HbF method including fetal cell HbF content at birth. Results of the spiked samples show the difference between methods is unlikely to be due to prophylactic A/D. Anti-HbF is complex and less robust, making it more difficult to achieve accurate results. Both direct and indirect A/D methods are suitable for use in FMH estimation even when RAADP has been administered. We have developed a new automated technology for the detection of irregular antibodies suitable for automation and high throughput. The method does not require centrifugation steps thanks to the use of magnetic red blood cells (RBC). This methodology requires washing steps under magnetic field and is based on the fixation of sensitised RBC on the surface of a well coated with monoclonal anti-human globulins. In a first step, serum and ready-to-use RBC were distributed on a microplate and incubated 10 min at 40\u00b0C, and excess of unbound immunoglobulins is removed by washing. In a second step, RBC were transferred in the antiglobulins-coated plate and placed 4 min on a magnet plate. Wells in which antigen-antibody interactions have occurred display a confluent layer of RBC (positive reaction). The negative reaction appeared as a pellet in the middle of the well. The test can be read by eye or by an automatic reader. The patterns in the well are stable for at least 24 h at room temperature. Antibody-positive plasma samples were obtained from routine screening and negative controls from random blood donors and patients. They were prior characterised using gel tests. The first results are obtained in about 25 min, and the detection limit is close to 10 ng/ml with anti-RH1. Comparative studies showed that our new technology, without any centrifugation steps, is reliable and sufficiently sensitive and specific enough to detect irregular antibodies linked to RBC.",

With introduction of micromethods in pretransfusion testing, we observed evident increase of total incidence of both DHTRs and DSTRs, from 1:4347 to 1:2000 (P < 0.001). The incidence of DHTR was almost the same, but the incidence of DSTR increased from 1:8333 to 1:2500 (P < 0.000001) units transfused. The introduction of GT in crossmatching resulted in another increase of total incidence of DHTR/DSTRs, from 1:4167 to 1:1389 (P < 0.001) compared with period when CAT was used only on bloodgrouping. The incidence of DHTR did not significantly change but the incidence of DSTR increased from 1:5556 to 1:1754 (P < 0.001). 122 RBC antibodies involved in appearance of DHTR/DSTRs, represent 6.9% of totally discovered clinically significant alloantibodies in evaluated periods.",

The chip contains at each side one injection port that fits in luer syringes and from which blood is equally distributed to the two reaction chambers via microfluidic meanders. The reaction chambers contain prefilled antibody reagents. Method: A luer syringe filled with patient whole blood or with segment blood is connected to the respective injection port of the chip. Injection is stopped as soon as a blood droplet is visible in the reaction chambers. The chip is then rocked gently back and forth. Results (haemagglutination) can be read after 1 min. Results: From 100 EDTA-blood samples tested (25 each of blood group A, B, AB, O, including Ax, A3B), all blood types were identified correctly. Discussion: The ABO identity test presented here is a closed system with one single pipetting step for recipient and segment blood each. This, together with the use of syringes without needle, may help to increase the safety for the nurse and reduce the risk of bedside testing errors. Performance evaluation studies are currently under way. Conclusions: CAT-DAT shows increased sensitivity versus tube-DAT. Further study is needed to determine its specificity.",

Incompatible transfusion to patients with Kidd antibodies often results in rapid cell clearance and a negative DAT. We have shown that when conventional antibody techniques fail to resolve such cases, red cell phenotyping is a useful additional approach. We report on a 57-year-old male with no recollection of transfusion, but previously had undergone open-heart surgery. Five days post-transfusion of 4 Units of apparently compatible blood, he had signs of a DHTR, with black serum, dark urine and serum bilirubin level of 85 lmol/l (normal range: 0-21 lmol/l). Routine pre-transfusion tests, DAT, enzyme IAT, two stage IAT and a manual polybrene test on pre-and post-transfusion samples all proved negative. Phenotyping pre-transfusion samples showed the patient to be N-, s-, P 1 -, Jk(b-); posttransfusion samples showed mixed populations using anti-N, -s and P 1 , but no circulating Jk(b+) red cells. One of the transfused units was confirmed as Jk(b+). Subsequent serum samples demonstrated a weak anti-Jk b (reactions with homozygous cells only, using DiaMed enzyme IAT). A month on the antibody was undetectable. Transfusion of Jk(b-) blood gave no reaction. Following the successful use of phenotyping in two similar cases, it is now included as part of the routine protocol when detection of antibodies prove difficult, especially where there is clear evidence of a DHTR.",

Anti-K was detected in the plasma but no free autoantibody was present. The DAT was positive (IgG 3+,C3d 3+). A red cell eluate did not react with one Kp(b-) cell present on the red cell panel in use; the anti-Kp b specificity was confirmed using additional Kp(b-) cells. The patient's cells were group O D+ K-Kp(b+). One month after recovery, the eluate no longer showed anti-Kp b specificity. Discussion: Auto anti-Kp b has been reported in AIHA, but in these cases free auto anti-Kp b was detected. This case is unusual in that although the red cell eluate showed auto anti-Kp b specificity, no free autoantibody was detected in the plasma. The assignation of a specificity was fortuitous, because the cell panel in current use included an example of the unusual Kp(b-) phenotype. Disease-associated transient suppression of Kell antigens has been reported and it has been suggested that this may explain the transient nature of autoantibodies to Kell system antigens, but in this case no suppression of the Kp b antigen was noted. Background: Since April 2003, we have been routinely using two Galileo automats to test 800-1200 donations per day (220 000 per year). We report our experience in terms of automat throughput and organizational aspects. Methods: Galileo is a full automat with random access (different combinations of tests for each sample) and continuous access (loading of new samples while tests are being performed). It uses hemagglutination in microplates. We perform: ABD forward and reverse grouping and RhK typing on the first two donations; short ABD on each donation; short ABD on a bag segment for first-time donors; antibody screening for first-time donors and when medically requested.

We then adopted manual sorting of the samples and sequential testing on Galileo (same test for all loaded samples). We also had to add, over 900 donations, another technician for manual tests. Materials and methods: 54 frozen samples, containing 60 irregular antibodies, were tested with an automatic system (AutoVue Ortho CD), both with the 3% and the 0.8% screen panels (Surgiscreen 0.8% and 3%, Ortho CD). The titre of each sample was determined with specific cells of the two panels. 2572 samples were screened with AutoVue, 1521 using the 3% screen panel and 1021 with the 0.8% one. On positive samples antibody identification and titration were performed. Results: All the 54 samples reacted with the specific cells of the two panels. The reactions scores were higher with the 0.8% system in 23 cases (43%), with the 3% system in six cases (11%) and in 25 samples (46%) it was the same. Fifty antibodies (83%) showed higher titres with the 0.8% cells and 10 (17%) with the 3% ones. Thirty-three out of 1551 random samples (2.1%) reacted with the 3% panel and 22 out of 1021 (2.3%) with the 0.8% panel. Thirteen out of 33 (0.8%) and 12 out of 22 (1.2%) were not confirmed. Conclusion: The known antibodies were confirmed in all the samples with both methods. In 83% of the cases the titre was higher with the 0.8% cells.

            "text": "Gel Card sensitivity and accuracy in resolving ABO blood grouping discrepancies The data suggests that the Gel Card procedure may not allow for detection of weak reverse groups, possibly due to final red cell concentration and effect of increased diluent concentration and storage time on the B antigen. Tube typing uses the standard 3-5% final red cell concentration and allows for increase in the serum/cell ratio as well as increased room temperature incubation time. Background: The molecular basis of many blood group antigens has enabled development of molecular genotyping techniques to identify blood group alleles. We evaluated the ability of PCR-SSP to determine ABO and RhD blood groups using buffy coat cells from routine EDTA samples from an extended phenotype panel as a source of DNA. Materials and methods: Samples (n \u00bc 28) were phenotyped for ABO and RhD and DNA extracted using a QIAamp Kit. Primers specific for the common ABO alleles (A1, B, O1 and O2) and eight exons of RHD were synthesised according to published genomic DNA sequences. Primers, MgCl 2 , DNA concentrations and cycle numbers were all optimised before achieving standardised blood group specific PCR-SSP assays.",

Similarly, amplification of RHD exons 5 and 6 produced false positive bands in all RhD negative samples tested (n \u00bc 5/28). Both protocols required extensive modifications of published primer and MgCl 2 concentrations and amount of template DNA, in order to achieve expected results. Using the optimised assays resulted in complete concordance between DNA typing and serological phenotypes. Conclusions: It is apparent that published blood genotyping methods may not be automatically applicable for routine practice even in another experienced laboratory. Bowman and Pollock (1993)], reports of C w HDN are extremely rare and are usually of mild to moderate severity. We report two cases of C w alloimunisation causing severe HDN requiring exchange transfusion at delivery. Anti-C w was eluted from the affected infants' red cells and apart from C w HDN, no other underlying pathology was noted. Case 1: SD delivered at term with an anti-C w titre of eight. Infant WD was DAT positive (IgG 4+) and C w positive, cord Hb13.1 g/dl and serum bilirubin 305 mmol/l. An exchange transfusion was required. Case 2: DW delivered at term with an anti-C w titre of 32. Infant IW was DAT positive (IgG 4+) and C w positive, cord Hb 11.7 g/dl. Two exchange transfusions were required. Both babies were referred back to hospital approximately 6 weeks post delivery with anaemia (Hb 6.7 and 7.2 g/dl, respectively). One infant required two top-up transfusions.",

Using C w -positive screening cells for antenatal testing alerted the hospitals to the risk of this rare cause of HDN Results: 14% DAT-positive patients (DATs) at first admission were proved as not transfused/pregnant but 38% requested transfusion of which 76% urgently. Positive Ab screening in 85% DATs with urgent request revealed 15 polyspecific, five specific (three e, one C + e, one c) autoAbs and 34 alloAbs (nine with autoAbs). Anti-E, K, C and c were found in 21, 11, 7 and 4% urgent DATs, respectively. 71% DATs requested blood during 2 years: 26% in one, 51% in two to nine and 23% in more than nine occasions. Transfusion was at least once cancelled in 10% and postponed for >4 h in 35% DATs (in 17% >24 h), in 77 and 92% at first admission. 55% postponements >24 h were due to auto, 30% to allo and 15% to auto + alloAbs. Monoclonal patient typing could not be done due to prior transfusion in 17% and polyclonal without laborious procedures in another 54% DATs. In D-positive DATs prophylactic Rh-K-Jk-matched transfusions (PAM) would be often neg for E-K-Jkb (22%), E-K-Jka (18%), E-c-K-Jkb or E-K (15%). For each blood unit 6.7, 8.3, 25.0 and 1.9 donors should be screened, respectively. In D-negative DATs units would be negative for C-E-K-Jka (39%) and C-E-K-Jkb (28%), with 5.3 and 3.8 donors screened, respectively. Conclusions: Due to many urgent transfusions, positive Ab screening and cancelled/ postponed requests, rational approach at least in our case seems to be: autoAb absorption + identification + complete typing at first admission, and Rh-K-Jk PAM + serum antibody identification at blood transfusion. Results: DATs were 52.6 (0.5-95) years, 57% female, 59% found at blood grouping/ cross reactions, only 15% at AIHA investigation, coming from internal medicine (58%, hematology 28%), hemodialysis (11%) and ''unusual dpts'' (18%), with often diagnosis: primary AIHA (16%), lymphoproliferations (13%), renal insufficiency (9%), solid tumors (8%) and cyrrhosis (5%). In 153 IgG DATs, 77 warm autoAbs and 76 negative eluates were found. In 28 IgG + C3d DATs 17 were warm, three warm/cold AIHA and eight due to drug or immune complexes (IC). In seven C3d DATs, four were cold AIHA and three due to drugs/IC. Antibody screening was positive in 109 (58%) DATs: 28% polyspecific, 10% specific autoAbs (anti-e, e + C, E, E + c, c, N and I), 39% polyspecific auto + allo and 11% alloAbs were found. Anti-E was found in 22, K in 15, c in eight, C in seven, D and HLA in five, Jka in four, S and Lua in two, Jkb, Fya, Fyb, Cw, M, Kn1 and Ch1 in one patient. 14 patients had >1 alloAb.

The samples were incubated for 32 h at 37\u00b0C with constant agitation. The radioactivity in the supernatants was quantified using liquid scintillation spectrometry. The transfer of labeled cholesterol to plasma was 38.97 and 34.44% for the fresh and aged cells, respectively. The difference was not statistically different (P \u00bc 0.36).

Errors in antibody screening were decreased from 29.4% in the first year to 5.9% in the following years. Antibody identification was not routinely performed in all laboratories but the number was increasing each year from 82.4 to 94.1%. Conclusion: We conclude that an EQA program in red cell serology should be maintained to compare results from different laboratories and to identify which laboratories need improvement on test procedures. Moreover, training programs, especially capacity building for laboratory personnel, need to be considered. Thus, the patients will receive appropriate and safe transfusions. Most reports on the frequencies of blood group antigens center on the racial differences with little or no report on the ethic variations of these antigens.

The phenotypic expression of this genotype is very heterogeneous and depends on a complex interplay of genetic and non-genetic factors. Aim of the present study was to determine if mutations in one of the two juvenile haemochromatosis genes, i.e. HFE2A and HFE2B (HAMP), were associated with more severe iron overload phenotypes in p.C282Y homozygous patients. Materials and methods: We studied, by DHPLC and subsequent sequencing analysis, the HFE2A and HFE2B coding region in a cohort of 310 p.C282Y homozygous patients that had a transferring saturation level greater than or equal to 45%. Results: We found 14 p.C282Y homozygous patients carrier of an additional mutation in either HFE2A (n \u00bc 9) or HFE2B (n \u00bc 5) and observed that their iron indices were effectively among the most elevated of the cohort. Conclusion/Discussion: Our results revealed that mutations in either the HFE2A or HFE2B gene could explain one part of the p.C282Y/p.C282Y-related phenotypic heterogeneity by accentuating the iron burden. They are in accordance with previously studies, performed in different models of knockout mice, which have evidenced that search for modifier genes could enable us to more precisely distinguish those p.C282Y homozygous patients with a higher risk to develop a severe iron overload and, consequently, clinical complications. Objectives: To estimate the incidence of RHD-positive/D-negative individuals in our population and to analyse the molecular structure of RHD alleles detected. Methods: 96 D-negative blood donors (13 rr, 53 r\u00a2r, 27 r\u00a2\u00a2r, 2 r\u00a2r\u00a2\u00a2 and 1 r\u00a2\u00a2r\u00a2\u00a2) were studied. DNA samples were screened using a rhesus box analysis method. Samples carrying RHD-positive haplotypes were further studied by RHD exon scanning and RHDw specific PCR.

Four new polymorphisms or combinations were found. (C) D-categories: 9\u00b7 D-VII, 33\u00b7 D-VI (1 type III, 28 type II, 4 type I), 3\u00b7 D-HMi, 1\u00b7 D-IIIb and 1\u00b7 D-Va, 19\u00b7 D-HAR (Rh33). (D) Weak-D type-1: 114 samples (84%) were Cc \u2026 ee, 19 (14%) were CC \u2026 ee; D-type-2: 53 (95%) with ccEe, three (5%) with CcEe; D-types 4: seven (100%) were cc \u2026 ee. (E) Serologic results within a single weak-D group were inconsistent for both, complete and incomplete sera, typing by serology was problematic since an assessment between weak and partial D could not be done solely by serology. In a case of disputed paternity 13 polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) marker systems including the amelogenin sex test were investigated in blood samples of the mother, her child and the alleged father. In three marker systems the mother was excluded from maternity of her child. Furthermore the X-and the Y-specific fragments of the amelogenin gene were detected in her blood. As the mother had a twin brother, twin chimerism was assumed as a possible reason for this phenomenon. Therefore samples from blood, buccal cells, fingernails and eyebrows were taken from both twins. Red cell antigens were investigated by serology and by PCR-SSP. All red cell marker systems were identical in the blood of both twins. The investigation of the above-mentioned set of polymorphic STR-loci and of three more loci in blood, buccal cells, fingernails and hairs of the proposita and her twin brother gave the following results: the DNA profiles obtained from her blood samples were identical with all samples (blood, buccal cells, fingernails, hair) obtained from her twin brother. In her buccal cells and her fingernails a mixture of her own and her twin brother's alleles were found. In the hair sample, the true genotype without admixture from her brother's alleles could be defined. These results showed that maternity of the proposita could no longer be excluded. Therefore samples taken from different tissues, especially hairs, should be tested in these cases in order to find out the true genotype.",

To understand the molecular genetic basis of this polymorphic system, we have analyzed genomic DNAs obtained from Japanese individuals with ABO variant phenotypes. Materials and methods: The ABO variant phenotypes focused in this study were A int , A 3 , A x , A el , B 3 , B x , B el , A int B, A 2 B, A x B, A el B and A 2 B 3 . The DNA samples obtained from peripheral white blood cells of the individuals were analyzed using PCR-based methods, and nucleotide sequence analysis was performed for the exons 6 and 7 at the ABO locus. Results: We identified 22 different alleles. Twelve of them were SNPs on A allele, four were SNPs on B allele and six were chimera genes between A and B alleles. Sixteen of the 22 alleles were identical to the variant alleles reported previously. The other six alleles have not been reported, of which one was found in A 2 B phenotype, two in A el , one in B 3 , one in B el and one in A x B.

These assays may not be applicable to populations of highly diverse ancestry because of the genetic variation in RH between different ethnic groups. We determined the genotype for RHC/c in 138 unrelated blood donors with a highly diverse background and compared the results with those obtained by serological testing of RBCs. DNA samples from these blood donors were tested for C and c alleles of RHCE by two PCR assays: a multiplex PCR that includes primers recognizing a C-specific sequence in RHCE intron 2 and primers recognizing a cspecific sequence in RHCE exon 2 (Singleton et al., 2000) and a promoter region-based PCR-RFLP system (Tanaka et al., 2001) . Phenotype and genotype results of the multiplex PCR agreed in 100% of the cases, indicating that this assay can be applied to populations with a highly diverse background. However, genotyping for RHC/c using the promoter region-based PCR-RFLP provided 36 (26.1%) discrepant results compared with those obtained by phenotyping and genotyping with the multiplex PCR: three samples were phenotyped as CC and genotyped as Cc; six were phenotyped as Cc and genotyped as CC, five were phenotyped as cc and genotyped as CC and 22 samples were phenotyped as cc and genotyped as Cc. The multiplex PCR developed by Singleton et al. is a reliable RHC and RHc genotyping assay in populations with genetic mixture.",

Conclusions: Our real-time PCR method and strategy used proved to be reliable for the determination of the fetal RHD status from maternal plasma. Background: B allele subgroups are rare (<1%) and only limited molecular genetic analysis have been reported. Methods: Samples from two unrelated donors were submitted to ABO serology and molecular analysis. ABO phenotypes were determined by agglutination and adsorption-elution tests using monoclonal/policlonal antibodies. Exons 6 and 7 of ABO gene were cloned and sequenced. Results/conclusion: Red cells from both donors did not react with anti B and anti AB reagents. However, red cells were able to absorb anti B, which could be eluted subsequently. Both samples had strongly positive reactions with anti H. First donor presented a weak serum antibody that agglutinated B cells (at 4\u00b0C) and H substance was found in saliva -subgroup serologic status was defined as Bel.

Total of 48 samples of partial D were classified by multiplex PCR (D DFR-14, DV-5, DVI-7, DIVa-5, DIVb-4, DIII-2). 35.4 and 22.9% of cases of partial D could not be classified into known category by partial D kit and multiplex PCR, respectively. Conclusion: The incidence of partial D is 0.15% in western India. Multiplex PCR was superior to partial D kit in classifying partial D variants. DDFR partial D variants are detected more frequently in Indian population. Background: An ABO-typing discrepancy, found during routine testing, was evaluated including serological and molecular typing strategies. Subsequently, a family study was conducted. Material and methods: ABO blood group typing was performed on all tested samples by using a standard gel centrifugation test cards. Exons 6 and 7 of the ABO gene were analysed using PCR-SSP and DNA sequencing of genomic DNAs from members of the family containing the weak B phenotype. Additionally, absorption/elution techniques were performed. Results: Using gel centrifugation test cards negative reactions with the propositus RBCs were obtained with anti-A, anti-B and anti-AB using monoclonal antibodies, but a weak positive reaction with anti-AB only using the polyclonal test card. Reverse typing showed 4+ reactions with A1 and A2 RBCs while no reactions with B and O RBCs. In the B-allele of the propositus and one B-allele of his mother a 27 base duplication/insertion was found leading to a duplication of the respective intron6/ exon7 area. Using absorption /elution methods we were able to show that weak B antigens were present on the erythrocytes of the propositus. Conclusions: In this study a new allele with a 27 base duplication encompassing nucleotide positions 234 to 260 was identified in the weak B phenotype. Background: Non-invasive prenatal identification of fetal RHD status is a goal of obstetrical practice, in order to prevent maternal immunization and to help in the management of alloimmunized pregnant women, without inherent risks of the invasive procedures.

Results: There was complete agreement between RHD genotype results obtained with DNA from maternal plasma, and fetal RhD type determined by hemagglutination at birth.

Case report: A donor phenotyped as RhD-negative at the first donation with a commercial IgM monoclonal anti-D reagent, was found to be weak D+ with an IgG monoclonal anti-D in conjunction with the antiglobulin test at his second donation. The weak D type was determined by a PCR system using sequence specific primers that detect the common weak D types (Wagner and Gassner, 2001) and confirmed by sequence performed on PCR products amplified from genomic DNA using RHD-specific primers for exon 6, which covers a missense mutation diagnostic for the weak D type 1 allele. A look-back was conducted for the transfusion recipient who showed alloanti-D in her serum. This recipient was exposed to other five allogeneic blood units that were rechecked for D-type and confirmed to be D-negative by phenotyping and genotyping.

The RHD deletion, found in most RhD-Caucasians, was theoretically due to recombination of the 5\u00a2 and 3\u00a2 Rhesus boxes resulting in the formation of a hybrid Rhesus box. The aim of this work was to evaluate a PCR-SSP method for RHD zygosity assignment by amplification of the hybrid Rhesus box. We studied blood samples of 95 trios (father/mother/child). The Rh phenotype was performed by hemagglutination. The RHD deletion was determined by PCR with primers that selectively amplify a segment of the hybrid Rhesus box. The most probable genotype was assigned according to frequency tables. Serological and PCR inconsistencies were analysed by a PCR-RFLP method to detect the hybrid Rhesus box and genotyped for D, C/c, E/e. RhD-individuals (n \u00bc 52) and all RhD+ members whose heterozygous status was confirmed by family studies (n \u00bc 40) were PCR+ for the deleted allele. In the rest of the RhD+ samples (n \u00bc 193) the zygosity assigned by PCR agreed with the most probable genotype except for 10 cases. One homozygous and nine heterozygous samples according to serology typed PCR+ and PCR-, respectively. PCR-RFLP analysis confirmed the results of PCR-SSP. No discrepancies in Rh phenotyping and genotyping were found. The discrepant results may be attributed to low frequency haplotypes that confound the zygosity determined serologically. This assay is a reliable method for RHD zygosity testing and allow a better management of sensitized pregnant women.",

Inherited platelet antigens in the fetus, lacking in the mother, cause the production of maternal platelet antibodies which cross the placenta and destroy fetal platelets resulting in life threatening fetal thrombotic disease. No records exist for the frequencies of FMAIT in the South-African population. Preliminary statistics are available for the frequencies of HPA (human platelet antigens) 1-5 and -15. The case presented is of a 19-year-old Black female who presented with a miscarriage in the 32nd week of pregnancy. The clinical picture of the baby was typical of NAIT with intercranial hemorrhage and petechiae. Materials and methods: ACD samples were taken from the mother and father and tested for human platelet antigen types 1-5 and -15. A tissue sample was obtained from the fetus post mortem, and DNA extracted. A genotype was also performed on this sample. A serum sample was obtained from the mother and sent to Platelet Immunology Center in Cambridge for platelet immunofluorescence test and monoclonal antibody-specific immobilisation of platelet antigens assay (MAIPA). Results: The mother typed negative for HPA 5a and the father and fetus positive for this antigen. The MAIPA test was positive for anti-5a platelet antibodies. It is extremely likely that the cause of the intrauterine death was due to the maternal platelet antibody, anti-5a. PTP and HIT are two immune syndromes causing thrombocytopenia with some clinical similarities but profound differences in their pathogenesis requiring different approaches for diagnosis and treatment. PTP is caused by platelet alloantibody, which extends its specificity and destroys both incompatible transfused and also patient's thrombocytes. The patient is threatening with bleeding complications. HIT-Ig activates platelets and mediates thromboembolic complications. Differential diagnosis between them must be therefore carefully considered. Here we present one case of PTP and HIT coincidence, which is very improbable and has not been reported yet. A 70-year-old woman underwent a total hip joint endoprothesis operation. She was treated with fraxiparin and after the operation she was transfused with 3 Units of packed red cells.",

Nevertheless platelet count not elevated until corticoid therapy was charged on the 11th day. On the 13th day, platelet antibodies were detected and PTP diagnosis was established. Although PTP and HIT coincidence is statistically almost impossible, it can happen and therefore it must be considered. NAITP is due to maternal alloantibodies against foetal platelet specific antigens (85% anti-HPA1a, 15% due to others) resulting in neonatal thrombocytopenia that may cause intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and death. The incidence is 1/1000-1/2000 pregnancies. The aim is to study a management protocol of NAITP to reduce morbidity and mortality due to bleeding complications. A total of 5000 pregnant females are screened for HPA1a platelet phenotype. In the HPA1a negative women, samples are taken for anti-HPA1a antibodies. Alloimmune women will be followed until week 36-38, where they have delivery by CS. Foetal cord blood sample is taken immediately and platelets count is performed.

All patients received cross-matched platelets: three of them were also provided with HLA-HPA compatible platelets. The DAT was positive in 33% of patients, ITCL only in 7%. The elution confirmed 60% of positive DAT, but also was positive in the 6.5% of negative DAT. In 988 studies (53%) all the tests were negatives, 343 (18%) studies were considered sure positives, 182 (10%) were probably unspecific (by negative elution). In 335 (18%) studies we could not performed elution by insufficient platelets sample (48% of this had positive DAT or ITCL). Conclusions: In our opinion the eluate is the most specific test for autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Our results seem to be lower than in other reports, but there are a great percentage of incomplete studies due to a few sample or very few platelets count and of course not all the studies remitted had a real autoinmune thrombocytopenia, we need to analyse these data with a more clinical information to know the real value of this method. Background: During the Taiwan epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many health care workers were infected. In an effort to establish a screening program for high risk personal, the distribution of HLA class I and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance to SARS coronavirus infection. Methods: HLA allele typing was performed on 37 cases of probable SARS, 28 fever patients excluded later as probable SARS, and 101 non-infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly exposed to SARS coronavirus. A control set of 190 Taiwanese was also used in the analysis. Results: When analyzing infected SARS patients and high-risk health care workers groups, HLA-B*4601 (OR \u00bc 2.08, P \u00bc 0.04, Pc \u00bc n.s.) appeared to be associated with SARS coronavirus infection. When comparing 'severe cases' patient group with the high-risk health care workers group, the severity of SARS was shown to be significantly associated with HLA-B*4601 (P \u00bc 0.0008 or Pc \u00bc 0.0279 670 000 l of plasma was produced: 73% from whole blood donations and 27% through plasmapheresis. About 22% of the plasma distributed was used for clinical purposes and 78% was sent to industries for processing into plasma derivatives. The results of this study confirmed an increasing trend in the number of blood donors and donations in the last years; the national need of red blood cells was satisfied with a large disparity and heterogeneity at regional level. The amount of plasma collected and sent to industries showed a constant increasing trend in the last years, covering 62% of the national use in plasma derivatives. Objective: The aim of our study is to determine the consumption of PC and to compare it with prepared PC. Methods: In our hospital we prepare PC from random donors by platelet-rich plasma (PRP) method and by apheresis from single donors (SDP). PC are prepared on demand for single patient and one therapeutic dose of each blood group.",

At the beginning of the reforms 10 BTSs existed in this region .One of them were a regional and the other nine were hospital-based services. Each of them collect, process, test and distribute blood to local hospitals. As the testing generate 70% of all costs it was wise to centralize that procedure at first. At the moment it is going to be done in four regional BTSs, each providing blood for 500 000 inhabitants. Because of lingual diversities as well as geographical and technical difficulties collecting and processing is proposed to remain in hospital based BTS. Conclusion: Through this concept, we believe we will promote transfusion practice appropriate to the environment in which is operating. Since the UN Declaration of Human Rights much has improved. However, the fundamental right of health and education lacks in most of the world. Since the outbreak of AIDS WHO has invested much energy invested in developing safe and sustainable blood supply systems as integral part of health care. However, reality provides a smarting picture -19% of global population belongs to the more developed world, has access to 61% (49 \u00b7 10 6 ) of all blood collected that complies with modern requirements of safety, provided by good organisations and to international quality standards. The remaining 81% lives in those countries that still have to go a long way: only 39% (32 \u00b7 10 6 ) of the blood is collected, which often does not meet basic requirements of safety -unsafe and unreliable donors, >7% not tested at all, 32% partially, often with poor quality reagents. Most important problems: lack of political will and vision, insufficient legislation, lack of infrastructure and education, of voluntary regular donors, but also of coordinated and structured support and development. To support structured and coordinated development, Groningen University, WHO and Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation, has created an Acad. Institute International Development of Transfusion Medicine to allow academic research -how to structure and develop safe and sustainable blood supply, and postgraduate education for potential leadership in the developing world -Master Degree in Management of Transfusion Medicine.",

The North of Scotland Blood Transfusion Service based at Raigmore Hospital Inverness supplies all hospitals in the Highland Acute Hospitals Trust (HAHT). It serves a population of 300 000 scattered over 10 000 square miles. Superb donor support guaranteed sufficient bloodstocks to cover local needs, but blood ordering was inefficient. This, along with government directive and changes in working practice led to introduction of measures to enhance transfusion practice in HAHT. Measures included Maximum Surgical Blood Ordering Schedule (MSBOS) and Minimum Transfusion Requirements for Elective Surgery (MTRES), efficient issue and turnover of blood supplies, fixed protocols and guidelines, and education programmes for all staff. Each measure was audited and compliance communicated to service users.

Historically, the user-guide to these services has been contained in a 'doctor's handbook', issued at induction. We are working to replace the contents of this handbook with an intranet-based website, covering all pathology resources, and aimed primarily at medical and nursing staff. A web-based pathology resource has the advantages of instant updates, greater scope with more depth and feedback via e-mail. Instead of a handbook, users will be issued with a pocket-sized card giving the address of the website and details of how to access the pathology results server. The blood transfusion section includes both local and national information. Local content includes laboratory hours and contact details, products available for transfusion and the location of emergency stock throughout the Trust. Trust policies, blood transfusion guidelines and minutes of the Clinical User Groups can be downloaded. There is useful information on laboratory tests, management and investigation of transfusion reactions, the significance of red cell antibodies, bone marrow/stem-cell harvesting protocols and links to the Hospital Transfusion Team. It also includes detailed instructions for using the Blood Track\u00d2system. National content includes downloadable SHOT reports. Links to other relevant internet-based resources are included. Table: Conclusion: The significant trend of decrement of eliminated blood is mainly due to the lower number of uncontrolled unites because of the presence of fat in the samples and also the mild decrement of the viral marker positivity. We may conclude that this is as a result of increased efficiency of the transfusion service, which includes better donor selection as well as improved collection, production and laboratory control system. Background: In response to a transfusion service environment of anticipated increase in workload, an automated analyzer (ABS2000, Immucor) was purchased in 1999 to meet department needs. As workload increased over time, more testing categories were considered for automated processing. Due to a relatively minor percentage of routine testing (33.9%), the majority of tests in the transfusion service are categorized as stat, ASAP or trauma. Initially, only routine testing was considered for automation but with increasing workload, all testing categories of type and screen/cross match have been assimilated for ABS2000 processing. Study: A statistical analysis was performed to determine what percentages of testing categories were being automated using the ABS2000. Data was collected over a 2-week period (7 April-20 April, 2003 inclusive). Percentages were calculated for each test category. During this study period, the automated analyzer was routinely in use and the manual test was solid phase red cell adherence for antibody screens. Blood types were tested by hemagglutination.",

Regular training on the appropriate usage and administration of blood is an effective method of minimising transfusion errors. The authors believe there is a gap in the current knowledge of learning needs of nursing staff in the safe administration of blood. Understanding learning deficits is essential in compiling training programmes for nurses in blood transfusion. This paper highlights the findings of a prospective longitudinal survey of one hundred nurses' knowledge of clinical practice and process in blood transfusion in a UK district general hospital. The results have informed the education programme delivered by the Blood Transfusion Practitioner and have been re-audited after a 1-year period to monitor the impact of revised training. Key areas of concern in knowledge of clinical practice and process were demonstrated but there were also areas of robust knowledge, i.e. 79% of nurses were unaware of the timing of standard blood observations but 91% acted appropriately in a suspected transfusion reaction. Audit recommendations: ensure blood transfusion training is an integral part of the Trust mandatory and induction courses; regular teaching sessions in clinical areas that are flexible and convenient for staff; develop a competency framework for nursing staff in blood transfusion practice The results of the re-audit, which will evaluate the effectiveness of the education programme, are nearing completion. Continuous improvement in the use of blood components is essential to ensure the patients' safety. We assessed the effect of education on ordering and utilization of blood components, in a university hospital. Material and methods: Retrospective reviews were performed periodically.",

Aim: A concept is presented combining ABD control of the blood bag in the laboratory with ABO-identity testing at the patient bedside. Concept: A plastic chip containing prefilled reagents is composed of an ABD-confirmation area with four reaction chambers (A-B-D-autocontrol) and an ABO-identity area with two reaction chambers (A-B). The chip can be attached irreversibly to the blood bag. The segments of incoming blood bags are tested in the laboratory utilizing the ABD part. The chip is then attached to the blood bag, which is stored refrigerated, until it is required for transfusion. The nurse performs the bedside test with a patient sample utilizing the second (ABO)-part of the chip. Discussion: With this concept: (1) the events of transfusion become a coordinated interaction between laboratory technician and nurse; (2) the ABD control done by the laboratory and the labelling of tested blood bags become part of an integral process; (3) the nurse is liberated from the preparation of the materials for bedside testing; (4) the result of patient bedside tests can be compared with the physically present result provided by the laboratory; (5) errors at the patient bedside are minimized due to the physical connection of blood bag and bedside test.

In this retrospective study, we have evaluated all screening carried out in the period between 2000 and 2003 in order to establish the incidence of NAITP in respect to clinical requests arrived at our laboratories. Anti-PLT auto-and allo-antibody research was performed with solid-phase and ELISA test in 1 200 pregnant women. In eight women alloantibodies were identified, with a specificity anti-HPA and/or anti-HLA; moreover in other seven subjects autoantibodies were founded (six panreactive and one anti-HPA-5b). In our study, a real anti-PLT alloimmunization is occurred only in 0.66% of investigated pregnancies. In the remaining cases there were probably an error in the clinical indication to the test or an error in performing the test by private or public nonqualified laboratory. In the end, this situation is resulted very expensive for our Hospitals with, on the other hand, a benefit for only few patients. In order to avoid useless or wrong tests, we suggest creating a highly specialized Regional Reference Center for NAITP to provide a better prenatal and perinatal consultation, diagnosis and therapy.",

Patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on hemodialysis tend to develop hypoproteinemia secondary to diffusion of amino acids from the patient's circulation to the dialysate. The drop in blood amino acid levels is as little as 21 \u00b1 7% a week. Infusion of aminosteryl nephro, a solution that contains a mixture of essential amino acids and histidine, was undertaken in 18 patients. 200 ml of the medication was given 60 min prior to end of the dialysis, with simultaneous injection of 200 ml of glucose solution (20%). The course of the auxiliary intravenous nutrition of the lasted two weeks during which the patient received 1.2 l of the solution aminosteryl nephr, i.e. 66 g of protein, or 2028 kcal. The efficacy of the therapy was evaluated based on the total protein and albumin blood levels, as well as on ALT and AST activities before and after nutritional. The therapy resulted in a rise in total protein and albumin blood levels from 67.8 \u00b1 1.52 to 74.7 \u00b1 1.43 g/l and from 26.1 \u00b1 0.12 to 3.46 \u00b1 0.14 g/l, respectively. On the contrary, AST and ALT activities fell from 46.5 \u00b1 11.2 to 24.2 \u00b1 9.2 U and from 66.8 \u00b1 13.2 to 28.0 \u00b1 10.4 U, respectively. In conclusion, the auxiliary intravenous nutrition via the balanced solution of amino acids leads to not only correction of albumin blood levels but also to amelioration of the liver function suggested by a decrease in ALT and AST activities. Introduction: The existence of a system of monitoring and evaluation is essential to assess the patterns of the clinical use of blood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usage of blood at the Clinical Centre, Skopje; especially the ratio of crossmatch (XM) to transfused components (C/T). Materials and methods: We evaluated the transfused surgical patients during 2002 year. We used the following indicators for monitoring and evaluation: units requested/ units transfused by patient category; percentage of unfilled requests by product; blood request form and transfusion reaction report form.",

Conclusion: The usage of blood in surgery is not satisfactory rational, and the supplies of blood are not adequate to meet demands.

This will facilitate the collection and analysis of meaningful adverse event data as a basis for continuing quality improvement to our blood system. Cytokines (IL-1b, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNF and LTA) generated by endothelial and white blood cells are associated with inflammatory responses including febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR). The occurrence of FNHTR was unpredictable and individual characteristics of each patient maybe involved. Moreover, there are some polymorphisms of these cytokine genes associated with different levels of gene expression. The aim of present study was to investigate the association of inflammatory cytokines gene polymorphisms with the occurrence of FNHTR in polytransfused patients. We studied two groups of polytransfused patients: one with FNHTR occurring after and the other before 20 expositions of donors. The gene polymorphisms studied were: IL1B-511C/T and +3953C/T, IL1RN int2, IL6-174G/C, IL10-1082G/A and -819C/ T, TNF-308G/A and LTA+253G/A using PCR and restriction digestion methods. All genotypes and allele frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. An association of IL1RN*2 and IL1RN2.2 genotype with the occurrence of precocious FNHTR (v 2 \u00bc 5.360, P < 0.025 and v 2 \u00bc 7.996 with P < 0.02) was detected. This allele and genotype have been related with higher levels of IL-1b. No other association was demonstrated. The occurrence of FNHTR was associated with blood components and individual characteristics of each patient. The association of gene polymorphisms related with the increase of inflammatory cytokine gene expression would be a relevant factor.",

In addition, there is the need to control the therapeutic efficiency and side-effects of transfused blood components. Methods and results: We have therefore established a risk assessment management system (RAMS) in order to control quality and safety of more than 1.6 million blood components in our blood bank. This novel system is an essential element of our quality management systems. It measures internal as well as external errors. All errors are analysed and categorised according to their error level. Using this grading, our system defines two different types of errors, pharmaceutically derived and diagnostically derived errors. Both error-types are documented by specific error-sheets, which included the verification of the error by the internal personal as well as the external client. Subsequently, error analysis, definition of quality and safety relevance and corrective and preventive actions are defined and centrally documented. All relevant aspects and results of our system are presented to the management board. Required structural modification of processes are subsequently implemented and periodically monitored. Conclusion: Risk assessment systems are of considerable use for improving safety and quality of blood components and related diagnostics. They can also increase the customer acceptance and satisfaction. Serious Hazards of Transfusion recommends that computerised systems be introduced in the transfusion chain to prevent 'wrong blood' incidents. BARS controls access to and release of, units from the blood bank fridge so that only trained staff with a validated ID card can collect. In July 2003 BARS was introduced on one site where 32 000 Units are issued per annum. At present BARS is restricted to the main issue fridge where it is used for the collection of red cells only. BARS also have the ability to audit all blood movements and provide a final bedside check; these components have yet to be introduced. Introducing BARS involved targeting the training of many different staff. Problems were encountered because of a high turnover of permanent staff and number of agency. Contingency plans were required for the potential risks and failures associated with the system. 658 members of staff are trained with ongoing weekly training available. To date no situations have arisen directly as a result of BARS. An in-depth audit of its activity is underway. Following the success of BARS we will be introducing it sequentially to the issue fridge on the other site, all satellite fridges and for the collection of other blood products. Benefits thus far have included the maintenance of collection records and the availability of more information in relation to the complexities of the transfusion chain. This information can be extremely useful for clinical risk and clinical governance issues.",

The advent of HIVtesting meant the possibility of infected recipients claiming they had been infected some years previously. Thus the archive was extended to an indefinite period. More recently with the introduction of HCV NAT minipool testing, the use of the PPT tube replaced the serum archive. A survey was conducted in 2003 to ascertain the usefulness of this archive in one of our centres over a 10-year period. Main uses of the archive have been (1) the investigation of adverse transfusion events, especially suspected transfusion-transmitted infection (TTI), transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI),",

For the assurance of a 24-h service, Slovenia needs 12 permanent on-duty specialists in transfusion medicine available in its 12 transfusion centres. Rationalization of personnel and substantial increase of blood safety could be achieved, using an online teleconsultation system. The existing information system was upgraded with a teleconsultation system that enables the exchange of professional information between 12 blood transfusion centres. The exchange consists of audio-visual communication, exchange of all transfusion-related data, availability of donor and patient histories and of a unified national blood donors data bank. The visual communication allows the remote interpretation of laboratory results via live-pictures of the gel cards used for immunohematology testing. Special care is dedicated to the safety issues. In the pilot study, pretransfusion testing results were interpreted correctly when a picture of the coded gel card was transmitted to the consultant on duty in the blood transfusion centre. Appropriate expertise was offered to the sending technician, enabling a correct transfusion intervention. This was the first telemedical service of its kind in Slovenia. With appropriate organisation and by virtue of telemedicine, it is possible to perform remote professional consultations. We expect that telemedicine will find its place in transfusion medicine. Background: In Slovenia, the idea of haemovigilance was present more than 40 years ago, when a unique transfusion reporting form was sent to hospitals with every bottle of blood. Because it was only rarely returned to the transfusion service, mostly in the cases of severe transfusion reactions, it was abandoned in the mid twenties. In 2000, mandatory reporting of adverse transfusion events was included in the Act on Blood Supply and implementation of haemovigilance system started. The aim of our work was to collect data on adverse transfusion events in Slovenia. Conclusions: We assume that the collected data was not complete, however, it does give us an insight into the clinical part of the transfusion chain. Although no fatal adverse transfusion events were reported, severe ones do still occur. A well-functioning haemovigilance system will give us a more complete knowledge of transfusion reactions in our country and the possibility for improvement in the safety and quality of blood transfusion.",

            "text": "Although the aetiology of TRALI is thought to be multifactorial, in >80% of UK cases where FFP is implicated there is a strong association with the presence of donor leucocyte antibodies (LAbs). LAbs are more common in female donors and develop as a result of pregnancy. Measures that reduce transfusion of LAbs are likely to reduce TRALI risk. Options were considered for reducing the risk of TRALI from FFP. The best option was to select male donors. We therefore investigated the feasibility of production of male FFP. To meet Council of Europe quality requirements, FFP is frozen on the day of collection (day 0). Blood centres aimed to maximize the number of male donations processed on day 0. Donations were identified manually at donor sessions as coming from male or female donors enabling selection of male donations for specific process streams resulting in FFP production. Male donor FFP increased from 56% in October 2003 to 94% in Jan 2004 and was maintained above 90% since November 2003. For the same period, the number of all male plasma components (FFP, cryodepleted plasma, cryoprecipitate, plasma for platelet pooling) produced, increased from 6597 (54.8%) to 8886 (72.8%) per week. It is feasible to increase the proportion of male FFP by a multidisciplinary operational approach. Further changes to staffing and pack usage will facilitate an increase in the proportion of other male plasma components. Impact on TRALI incidence will be monitored through the UK haemovigilance scheme. Treatment of patients with tumors by transfusion in most cases is the only way of their treatment, which includes use of different components of the blood and derivatives of plasma. The aim of this study was retrospective analysis of use of blood components in patients with tumors, malignant and benign as well. Material for this study was collected in University Clinical Centre of Kosova, during the period of time of 1 year.",

Vox Sanguinis (2004) 87 (Suppl. 3), S93-S145 During this period with blood products are treated 5062 patients, of different categories of illness, according to the International Classification. Those patients have received 17 044 Units of blood components, with the average of 3.37 Units per patient. From total number of patients, 762 (15.05%) were with different tumors and received 14.5% of units from all used units of hemoproducts, with the average of 2.92 Units. Most common blood component used for treatment of patients with tumors, were PRBC (21% from all used hemoproducts in this period of time). Average dose of applied PRBC in benign tumors was 1.8, in malign tumors 3.0 and in neoplasia of hematopoietic tissue 6 Units per patients. In comparison with PRBC, plasma was used quite less frequently (5.9% of units of all units used for all patients). Average dose of applied plasma was 2.13, and in neoplasia of hematoipoietic tissue1.0 for patient. Platelets were used more often than plasma (7.65%) and Cryo was used in 3.64% of all used blood components. Background: Each patient on haemodialysis (HD) suffers from anemia more or less. A work-up for a diagnosis of anemia should be considered when the Hb is <11 g/dl (Htc < 33%). The aim of this study is to point out how these patients were treated for anemia. Materials and methods: The data were used from the database of the Nephrology Clinic for the year 2003. The following parameters were investigated: levels of Hb, Htc, Er, serum iron, TIBC, ferritin, TSAT and iPTH. Results: There were 197 patients on HD, of which 156 (79.2%) on regular Epoetin beta therapy (Epo). The target Hb/Htc concentration for Epo treatment was 11 g/dl (33%). Epo was given subcutaneously at the end of each HD usually divided in three doses weekly (50-80 IU/kg/week). 132 patients received supplemental iron, which was given to maintain a TSAT > 20% and a serum ferritin level > 100 ng/ml, so that HD patients can maintain an Hb concentration >11 g/dl with or without Epo treatment. There were 43 (21.8%) HD patients who received blood in 2003. Starting dose for Red Blood Cells transfusion was Hb <85 g/dl (Htc < 28%). 22 of them received blood only once (1-2 Units), but 21of them had multiple transfusions during the year (from three to 10). The reasons for transfusion were acute blood loss and inadequate response to Epo. Conclusion: Epo has the main role in anemia treatment of the HD patients, and it should stay that way. Red blood cells should be always limited to circumstances in which anemia is not otherwise reversible. This poster developed by the author and distributed widely to hospitals in New Zealand used as a guideline and reference for junior doctors (and often some seniors too!) and mostly referred to by paramedical staff such as nurses and midwives. They have found it extremely useful to have information at a glance to help in their busy routines and followup more complex issues with respective blood banks or a specialist in this field in addition to guidance regarding transfusion of blood and blood products, product specification (as currently used in New Zealand) storage, addition of medicines and appropriate administration of these material, there is guidance with regards to good transfusion practice.",

These way unnecessary and potentially dangerous transfusions of components that are not needed will be avoided. The aim of the study is to show how the women who undergo radical hysterectomy (HTA) were managed. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study, where data were taken from the Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Skopje for the year 2003. Results: There were 118 women who had had radical operation (HTA) because of invasive carcinoma of cervix uteri in 2003.The average blood loss during one operation was 400-600 ml and the trigger for erythrocyte (Er) transfusion was Hb < 90 g/dl. Because of hypoproteinemia they received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and albumin (Alb). 62 women received 1 Unit of Er, 18 women received 2 Units during the surgery. 35 women received 1 Unit of whole blood, either because of need for all blood components or unavailability to provide separated blood components. There are only three women that did not receive therapy with blood during the surgery. All of them, also, received 1500-2000 ml crystalloid or colloids each. Postoperatively, they received 271 Units of Er (2.3 U/patient), 2000-2500 ml of substitutes each of them, 110 Units of FFP in 85 (72%) patients (1.3 U/patient) and 195 Units of 5% albumin in all 118 patients (1.65 U/patient). Conclusion: We should be more restrictive in the use of blood, blood components and the substitutes and we should use them only when it is highly necessary. Objective: Assessment of the effectiveness of the blood transfusion based on the clinical and the laboratory parameters. Materials and methods: A total of 67 patients were studied. Age, 16-60 years; normal volaemia; no active anemia. No pathology of the CV system, pulmonary, blood clotting. Patients were divided in three groups: 53 patients transfused with one unit of blood, 10 patients 2 Units, four patients 3 Units. Results: Lab findings after the transfusion: increase of the number of the RBC, Hct, Hb in the group I. In the group II there was a statistically significant increase comparing to the group I. In all the groups there was a marked improvement of the respiratory and HR. No significant changes in MBP were found after the first transfusion. In the groups II and III there was not found statistically significant improvement of the parameters after the first blood unit. After transfusion there were found no statistical changes in the clinical parameters between the three groups. Discussion: The transfusion of one unit of blood in the patients with acute anemia improves clinical parameters. Lab parameters improve according to the quantity of the blood units transfused. Clinical parameters remain substantially unchanged after the transfusion of the first unit of blood. Conclusion: The transfusion should be considered only as a part of the treatment of the patients with anemia. The blood quantity should be as small as possible. The value of Hb should not be considered as decisive. and AB) appears to place group O patients at an increased risk for perioperative blood loss, although its clinical significance in transfusion strategy is not known. Methods: A retrospective audit of 269 and 154 patients who underwent total hip (THR) and knee replacement (TKR), respectively, by one team of surgeons during a 3 years period was performed. We analysed data regarding patient's characteristics, ABO-type and RBCs-transfused, which were collected from patient's charts and Transfusion Service's records. Results: Patient characteristics regarding age, sex, preoperative and postoperative Hct were similar between the groups. There was no significant difference in perioperative transfusion requirement between groups O and non-O in THR and TKR, (1.93 \u00b1 1.28 vs. 1.65 \u00b1 1.15 Units/case; P \u00bc 0.94) and (1.47 \u00b1 1.1 vs. 1.32 \u00b1 1.02 Units/case; P \u00bc 0,43), respectively. The number (%) of patients not transfused between the groups for THR was [20 (19.6) vs. 41 (24.6); P \u00bc 0.184] and for TKR [23 (30.9) vs. 28 (35); P \u00bc 0.38]. The maximum number transfused per case was seven for THR and four for TKR. Conclusion: Our study revealed no significant difference in perioperative transfusion requirement between groups in both operations. Stress induced increased in vWF in the surgical patient may account for the lack of difference between groups. No difference in transfusion services practice appears necessary based on a patients ABO blood type.",

We studied the prevalence and the titration of anti-D in Brazilian donors, in order to estimate if this source could cover the country demand. Methods: During a 41-month period, 339 221 blood donors were submitted to antibody screening; if the test was positive, an antibody identification was performed. The donors with an anti-D were then called for an anti-D titration. For calculating the need of anti-D we estimated a 300 lg dose per woman, 3 million deliveries per year, and 180 000 annual anti-D doses. The yield of anti-D was based on published figures. Only donors with an anti-D titration \u202132 would be eligible for entering the plasmapheresis donation programme, and we estimated that each eligible donor would donate 4 l of plasma per year. Results: 366 donors (0.1%) presented an anti-D. 315 out of 80 678 female blood donors presented an anti-D (0.39%). Among the Rh-negative female donors, the anti-D prevalence was 3.98%. The mean anti-D titration was 16, and 20% of donors had a titration greater than 32. There would be 3000 female donors with an anti-D. At least 600 donors would be eligible (titration > 32), representing 2400 l of anti-D plasma per year. This would cover near 100% of Brazilian needs on anti-D immunoglobulin. Conclusions: Theoretically, Brazil would be self-sufficient in anti-D, if it started a plasma fractionation programme.",

Stem cell transplanted patients, although immunosuppressed, are at risk for the development of red cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT)antibodies. This study attempts to determine the incidence of RBC and PLT pre and post-transplant alloimmunization. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing stem cell transplants, autologous and allogeneic, between 2002 and 2003. We transfused only leucoreduced blood components and routinely screened these patients for alloimmunization on the day of the transplant (day 0). Indirect antiglobulin tests (IAT) using the microcolumn method and platelet antibody screening (solid phase tests -immuneadherence and ELISA) were carried out. A lymphocytotoxicity test was performed on the ELISA positive samples. Results: We analyzed 99 patients (44 allogeneic and 55 autologous transplants). Neither group showed evidence of pre-transplant or de novo red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization. We only found two pre-transplant HLA-positive and one pre-transplant HLA-positive patients in the allogeneic and the autologous groups, respectively. Conclusion: The screening for alloimmunization on day 0 facilitates the surveillance of the serologic follow-up of these patients. Alloimmunization is a rare phenomenon in this group of patients despite the fact that they are one of the most heavily transfused.A 17.3 Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia due to cisplatin D Brilhante, F Gomes, J Silva, MH Moreira, A Marques and J Oliveira Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Francisco Gentil (IPOFG), CROL, SA Background: The first description of cisplatin therapy-associated hemolytic anemia was in 1980 (Getaz et al.)",

Recently, the DO gene was cloned and sequenced, the molecular background associated with Hy-negative and Jo(a-) were reported and different combinations of the DO single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified (Rios et al., Transfusion 2002). Genotyping for DO in patients who had received multiple transfusions is helpful in the selection of RBC for transfusion. This study aimed to determine the DO alleles (DO A/DO B, HY and JO) in a group of multi-transfused patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Methods: We tested DNA from 84 SCD patients by PCR-RFLP analysis (Rios et al., Transfusion 2001, 2002), to determine the changes on nucleotides 378 C > T; 793 A > G (DO A/DO B), 323 G > T (HY), 898 C > G (HY1/HY2) and 350 C > T (JO). Results: Six (7.1%) of the 84 SCD patients studied were typed as DO A/DO A, 40 (47.7%) as DO A/DO B and 32 (38.1%) as DO B/DO B. Two (2.4%) samples genotyped as DO B/HY1 and four (4.7%) samples genotyped as JO/DO B. Conclusion: We describe results of PCR-RFLP assays that, for the first time, give the frequency of DO alleles in SCD patients. Dombrock genotyping in SCD patients can prevent the alloimmunization and aid in the antibody identification process. It is also helpful for the selection of antigen-negative donor RBC for transfusion.

The corresponding haplotype frequencies, linkage disequilibria values and relative linkage disequilibria values were estimated. The results show that the genotype distributions of MICA and MICB microsatellite meet Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in this population. In total, five alleles of MICA microsatellite and 14 alleles of MICB microsatellite were observed. MICA A5 was the most common allele (0.2877), whereas A4 was the least popular one (0.1321). MICB CA14 was the most common allele (0.3255), and CA19 and CA28 were the least popular ones (0.0047). Twenty-one kinds of MICA-MICB haplotypes occurred at frequencies of more than 1% (linkage disequilibria value > 0).

The unit was screened for HIV-antibodies and p24-antigen. The unit tested negative for all markers of transmissible disease. The red cell and platelet concentrate units were transfused to two patients and the fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was quarantined. In January 2003 the donor had sero-converted. Aim: The recipients were identified through look back and tested to determine their HIV-status. Method: Routine tests were performed on both recipients and FFP. Subsequent testing was determined by test results. The platelet recipient tested HIV-positive. Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis followed. The red cell recipient was negative. The following tests were performed 8 months post-transfusion: Prism HIV O+, HIV-1 and -2 ELISA, HIV-1/-2 Ab-capture ELISA, HIV-1 Western Blot, HIV-1 quantitative PCR, CCR5 genotyping and in vitro HIV susceptibility. PCR was done on the FFP. Results: Platelet recipient: Testing determined the HIV-1 subtype in donor and recipient to be identical. Red cell recipient: Results of tests done were negative. CCR5 genotyping showed a wild type CCR5 gene. In vitro PBMC's were susceptible to infection with HIV. FFP: Quantitative PCR: 12 RNA copies/ml. Conclusion: HIV transmission is highly effective through transfusion.

As a result of the relative stability of virus protein shell, transmission via blood products is also possible. Current inactivation methods fail to kill non-enveloped viruses, even though plasma donor units are not screened for B19. B19 replicates primarily in erithropoietic precursor cells, causing cell lysis. Depending on the immunologic competence, more or less pronounced anaemia can occur. Virus multiplication is limited because of the formation of specific antibodies. Therefore the infection causes no serious effects. Patients with chronic haemolytic anaemias, immunocompromised persons and pregnant woman are group of risk.Prevalence of viral markers for hepatitis viruses among blood donors in SloveniaS Levicnik-Stezinar, U Rahne-Potokar and P Nograsek Blood Transfusion Centre of Slovenia Introduction: The aim of the study was to present data on the prevalence of hepatitis viruses among blood donors tested at the Blood Transfusion Centre of Slovenia in the period between 1993 and 2002. Methods: Every blood donation is tested for HBsAg and anti-HCV using EIA. NAT testing of mini-pools for HCV RNA was implemented in March 2000. Viral markers for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) as well as other HBV markers (anti-HBs and anti-HBc) were determined on a selected number of blood donors. Results: 512 472 blood donations were tested for anti-HCV. 147 (0.028 or 0.32% of first-time donors) anti-HCV positive donors were detected. 66.6% of these were found to have HCV virus present. 515 289 donations were tested for HbsAg. 174 (0.035 or 0.39% of first-time donors) were found to be HBsAg positive. 1000 donors were tested for HAV and HEV. Positive results were obtained in 553 (55.3%) and 5 (5%) cases, respectively. 1000 HBsAg negative donors were tested for anti-HBs and anti-HBc. 25 (2.5%) were found to be anti-HBs only positive and 11 (1.1%) anti-HBc only positive. 27 (2.7%) donors were positive for anti-HBs, as well as for anti-HBc. Conclusions: The results of this study rank Slovenia among regions with a low prevalence of HBV and HCV in the blood donor population. The prevalence of HAV in the same group proved to be within the expected limits. The prevalence of HEV was found to be a bit above the values expected for the Central European region.Introduction: Iran is a country with an intermediate prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBsAg as the first viral marker and anti-HBc as past or current infection marker of HBV infection can be detected. HBsAb is evidence of immunity to HBV due to the last recovery marker of HBV infection or successful vaccination. The anti-HBc and HBsAb usually persist for life. These results illustrate that significant difference in prevalence and epidemiology of current or past HBV infection exists among different regions of Iran and related to geographical and social differences and migration status from other countries. Although blood transfusion is no longer a frequent way of infection, it is still the most known way of HCV/HBV transmission. One of our donors thought, HBV/HCV could be transmitted by handshake, and three out of 30 donors thought using public toilets could transmit Hepatitis B or C. Only 25 out of our 30 HCV/HBV positive donors did tell their physician about their Hepatitis B or C. This is probably the main reason why only few donors got sonography (12/30), determination of viral load (18/30) and determination of ALT (22/30) after diagnosis. Only five donors felt well informed about their disease. Conclusion: The lack of knowledge about the way hepatitis B or C can be transmitted and about possible specific therapy is very unsatisfying from an epidemiological point of view. Donor information and co-operation with physicians has to be intensified.Objective: To point out significant differences in HIV prevalence between different population categories. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all HIV tests performed at the transfusiology department of general hospital Subotica in the 3-year period. Initial tests and repeated tests were performed with Biomerieux (Organon), Boikit and Ortho. All RR samples were sent to the referent laboratory for confirmation. Results: In this study, we implemented three counties, with an estimated population of 222 000. During the mentioned period, a total of 25 966 samples were tested for the HIV antibodies. All samples were divided into three categories: If we review the first two groups we may get a wrong impression of HIV prevalence. Thus, with the aim of early detection and stopping the spread of HIV infection it is justified to conduct HIV detection free of charge during the whole year.",

Aim: Lothian Health Board Public Health Department requested an investigation into these cases since the donors did not report any risk factors on counselling and were from the same geographical area. Methods: HBV DNA was amplified by PCR using primers in the preS1 gene. Three recent HBV positive cases living in the same area and also from a randomly selected cohort of Scottish blood donors who had previously been shown to be HBV PCR positive were examined. Phylogenetic sequence analysis was carried out and comparison made with the Scottish cohort and with published sequences. Results: HBV DNA sequences from the three donors grouped in separate clades but along with other sequences from Scottish blood donors from Edinburgh and Glasgow. Conclusion: The sequencing results obtained established that the HBV infection in the three donors was not from a common source and were not related to each other.

We evaluated the frequency of risk factors in donors testing rr in the anti-HCV ELISA. Methods: All donations with rr results in the anti-HCV ELISA (Ortho Diagnostics) were tested in the anti-HCV immunoblot (RIBA\u00d2). Donors testing RIBA )ve in subsequent donations or with ind. or +ve reactivities in the RIBA were recalled to the blood bank to collect fresh blood samples (anti-HCV ELISA, RIBA and cDNA-PCR test) and to obtain a standardised interview. 47%) of the donors were recalled to the blood bank.

Even when blood samples are stored it is often the lack of stored cells that has hampered attempts to establish the The SNBTS is collecting samples to enable a quick response to the discovery and potential transfusion-associated risk of novel parentally transmissible agents and for making realistic assessments of the frequency of transmission of known viruses for which screening is not carried out. Methods and Results: Plasma, cells and DNA have been collected from anonymised Scottish blood donors. Species-specific real-time PCR assays and other serological and molecular techniques have been used to estimate the frequency of HHVNew molecular techniques are likely to lead to the discovery of new human viruses, many of which may exist in a commensural relationship with their host. The ability to screen and explore their epidemiology at an early stage will provide valuable information in assessing the threat that they may pose for the safety of blood transfusion.

Transportation boxes were filled with either red cells or Medicool pack inserts at 4\u00b0C and stored at 4, 22 or 32\u00b0C for 12 h. Internal box temperature was determined using four temperature loggers placed at different specified locations. The maximum acceptable transportation time at an ambient temperature <22\u00b0C was defined by the shortest time for the red cell or pack insert surface temperature to reach 10\u00b0C, when stored at 22\u00b0C, on any of the four temperature logger positions in each box type. With red cells, the UBP 110 and the UBP 130 maintained the internal box temperature <10\u00b0C for 6 h 30 min when stored at 22\u00b0C. At 32\u00b0C a surface temperature of 10\u00b0C was exceeded at approximately 2 h for both box types.

Hosp. East. On., Trans. On. Prog.-Ottawa, Stat. and Risk Assess. Sect., BSSHCAID, CIDPC, PPHB, Health Canada, Ottawa Hosp., Ottawa, ON, Canada The Krever Commission ('97) recommended an informed consent policy on transfusion. In November 2002 the Canadian Standards Association included this policy as a licensing requirement for hospital transfusion services. The Transfusion Ontario Programme in Ottawa conducted a survey on Paediatric Transfusion practices (November 2002-April 2003) in paediatric and general hospitals with paediatric services. Eight children and 21 general hospitals with paediatric services completed the survey. This sample data is summarized below.Conclusion: This sampling identified that 69% of the hospitals have an informed consent policy and 50% have an informed consent form. Eighty-six per cent report having discussions prior to transfusion but documented this in only 2/3 of cases. The children hospitals report similar data expect fewer have a separate informed consent form.

Result: Two hundred and eleven patients were registered in the teaching hospital, there were 108 male patients and 103 female patients in the study, average age is 43.8 \u00b1 23.1 years (median is 45). Among them, 159 cases were leukemia, 31 cases were cancer, and others were ITP, thyroiditis, hepatocirrhosis, DIC, etc. 34.45% events were transfused for the treatment of established bleeding in patients with deficiency of platelet number and/or function. In other 55.5% events, blood platelet was used for the prevention of bleeding in patients. And the other events were for the both. Myelodysplasia (89.7%) is the main cause of the etiology of thrombocytopenia. Only 4.41% cases were diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia. 1.93% cases were diagnosed platelet depleted. And none were transfusion for the congenital or acquired platelet dysfunction. Conclusion: Platelet transfusions are mainly used for the treatment of established bleeding and for the prevention of bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia, especially for leukemia.

Materials: Data of WB and RBC use from 1985 to 2003 in our hospital. Results: Till 1992 only WB was prepared in our blood bank (WB use 100%). After 1992 WB using rates decreased from 92 to 2.8%. In 1999-2001, the systematic decrease of WB use lost it force (17, 19 and 14% respectively), but in 2002 and 2003 the decrease accelerated again and we arrived a very low rate in WB use, 6.6 and 2.8% respectively.Discussion: Education about transfusion medicine is generally insufficient in the medical curriculum in our country. Insofar as it's possible, our blood bank staffs tries to persuade the doctors by phone to use RBC, when WB is requested. In the year 2000, WB was requested still 41% on the blood request forms, despite the rate of WB use was 19%. We began a education program; courses that takes 5 days, about transfusion medicine which is mandatory for all postgraduate doctors in training, since October 2000. Since February 2002 we arrange elective internships (2 weeks) for the 10th semester medical students also. We suppose that this education has a great influence on WB and RBC use in our hospital.

Precursor events (near misses, such as phlebotomy sample-errors) are identified through an internal tracking system. Trust wide error in specimen collection: 20 specimens incorrectly labelled each week 17% crossmatch requests and 83% requests for group/save serum. Occasional near misses detected where patient identification on sample did not match actual patient having been bled; actual errors occurred. Incompatible units of blood were transfused due to incorrectly labelling of the specimen. Risk awareness relies on good transfusion chain communication, particularly when risking overtransfusing blood products. Borderline performance within the Trust was revealed when requests are inconsistently given. The 3 months study focuses on awareness of safety issues within the daily practice of delivering an acceptable Transfusion Service. Important is the detection and correction of less serious errors.

Materials and methods: Participates were requested to perform ABO/RhD typing, antibody screening and identification, and crossmatch test. The analysis performed was depending on the identification of the errors made by participating laboratories. Results: Overall error rates in ABO typing was3.3% (5/153); in RhD typing was 3.9% (6/153): In antibody screening and antibody identification, the total error rate was 6.0% (10/150) and 2.9% (4/140), respectively; in crossmatch test, the error rate was 6.7% (30/447). Regarding the errors made in ABO/RhD typing, 81.8% (9/11) were due to reagents or poor techniques while the others (18.1%) made by transcription and misinterpretation. As to the errors in antibody screening, the fail negative results may amount to 100% (10/10) and in crossmatch test fail negative was 90% (27/30). Conclusion: This data will reflect the current state of the performance of transfusion laboratories in China. When compare with the data from UK NEQAS and WHO IEQAS, training programs, especially immunohematological skill for laboratory personnel, need to be considered.

Besides its wild type allele CYP2C9*1, two common allelic variants are known in Caucasians -CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 that in homozygous state express enzymes of very low activity. Aim: Evaluate the influence of CYP2C9 polymorphism on the variability of warfarin dose requirements. Materials and methods: A total of 358 subjects were included in the study. Patient group included 181 patients on warfarin therapy. Control group included 177 unrelated healthy volunteers. PCR-RFLP genotyping for CYP2C9*1, *2 and *3 alleles was performed by using Ava II, Nsi I and Kpn I restriction endonucleases. Results: Six different genotypes of CYP2C9 were identified in the patient and control group. As many as 42% of patients and 31.2% of controls were found to have at least one variant allele. The frequency of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles in control group was 12.4 and 3.7%, in patient group 17.4 and 6.6%, respectively (no statistical significant difference P > 0.05). The patients were divided into two subgroups, lower and higher than median dose of warfarin (4.1 mg). A considerably higher frequency of variant CYP2C9 genotypes was found in the subgroup on a lower than 4.1 mg daily warfarin dose (48.9% vs.36.3%). Conclusion: An example of clinically important genetic polymorphism of drug metabolism is the association of variant alleles of CYP2C9 with lower warfarin dose requirements.Positive Kleihauers: from a true TPH to the inappropriate use of anti-DTA Lofting, T Farren Blood Transfusion Department, Southampton General Hospital, UKBackground: The Kleihauer test is used to detect and quantify transplacental haemorrhages (TPH). Using three case studies, this report demonstrates that not all positive Kleihauer tests indicate a TPH. Materials and methods: The Kleihauer test was performed using a commercial kit (Guest Medical). Confirmatory tests were performed by flow cytometry. Results: Case 1: An infant was born with severe anaemia (Hb 23 g/l) due to a large TPH, estimated to be approximately 100 ml by the Kleihauer test and confirmed by flow cytometry. 10 500 IU anti-D was administered intravenously. A repeat Kleihauer test, 48 h later was negative. Case 2: A positive Kleihauer test was observed in a known case of reticulocytosis. No anti-D was administered inappropriately. Case 3: An infant was born with a positive (4+) DAT. Anti-D was eluted from the red cells. The mother had been given 10 500 IU anti-D Ig for an apparent large TPH. However, it was subsequently discovered that the mother had HPFH (Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Haemoglobin) of the Swiss Type, mimicking a large TPH. The anti-D Ig in this case was thus administered inappropriately. Discussion: The above cases highlight the fact that a positive Kleihauer test in a pregnant woman does not necessarily mean a TPH. Although these cases are relatively infrequent, they serve as an important learning tool for the interpretation of a positive Kleihauer and also to prevent inappropriate administration of anti-D Ig.EA Silva, MGCRL Fonseca, IP Sim\u00f5 es, B Tura, FJ Carvalho, LTG Pimenta and RS Mitraud National Institute of Cardiology of Laranjeiras, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Introduction: The relation between thrombosis and bleeding, added or not to the use of anticoagulant drugs determines the success or fail in therapeutics of patients that need to maintain a permanent anticoagulation. Objectives: To report the results of 1 year follow-up of the patients from the INCL anticoagulation clinics. Methods: A cohort of patients from the oral anticoagulation group of the ambulatory that submit to periodical coagulation tests, aiming to maintain the target INR according to their clinical necessity. Results: Between 2 May 2002 and 22 May 2003, we have made a survey of 1144 attended and followed patients: male, 510; female, 634; total medical meetings, 8852; average break time between meetings, 34.12 days; average meetings per patient, 7.74; average age of patients, 51.70; patients in the target INR range, 675; patients out of the target INR range, 456 (P < 0.0001). 13 patients presented with INR non-coagulation, but only three of them had bleeding as complication.Conclusion: The anticoagulation clinics have created rules that lead to a higher adhesion to the use of oral anticoagulant drugs. Added to this, better therapeutic results had been achieved whether it is compared to the traditional treatment and a good security standard has been demonstrated.Assessment of the rational and effective use of blood in surgeryT Makarovska-Bojadzieva, V Stefanovska, M Blagoevska, O Damevska, J Angelovski and K Kuzeska Institute of Blood Transfusion, Skopje, Macedonia",

A further 17.7% were SR. Of single unit TR, a median of 5.4 (range: 0-15) were removed in any 6-h period and occurred equally during all time periods; multiple unit TR were mostly 06:00-18:00 h Monday-Friday.

The data suggests there is a high crossmatch workload where 47.2% of units are not transfused following crossmatch, with 29.5% never removed from the fridge. The high rates of SR and PR on days following elective surgical lists suggest that excess numbers of units are requested for surgery. Single unit TR occurs at all times; this implies single unit transfusions are given 24 h a day.

Subjects and methods: A consecutive cohort of 161 patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture, 86 for hip replacement, 31 for knee fracture and 27 for knee replacement were evaluated. Results: Mean age for patients given transfusion was 71. Woman had a higher overall transfusion rate than men (64% vs. 36%). A total of 39.5% hip replacement, 36.1% hip fracture, 22.2% knee replacement and 12.9% knee fracture received allogenic transfusion.Conclusions: This evaluation allows identifying significant waste related to blood utilization practice in hip operations. Estimating expected perioperative blood waste is critical for establishing an effective transfusion strategy. Hospitals must collaborate with the regional blood supplier in a statewide transfusion practice and improvement initiatives for not increase blood waste. In patients undergoing and aggressive PABD schedule before major elective surgery often it is opportune, to increase the number of collected blood units (BU), the administration of EPO and iron. The presence of iron deficiency erythropoiesis (IDE) may reduce the yield of these procedures. 37 patients undergoing open-heart surgery were considered. The protocol foreseen for collection of 5 BU in 4-5 weeks, with administration of iron and EPO. Complete blood cells count (RBC, Hb, HCT, MCV, MCH, CHCM, WBC, PLT), reticulocytes indexes (%, RNA content, MCH, CHCM, % of hypochromic cells) and iron metabolism markers (iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation index, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor) were studied before and after the protocol. 163 BU were collected (mean: 4.4), only 14 BU (9%) were discharged, five patients (14%) needed of allogenic blood (mean: 3.2 BU). In routine blood cells examination a significant diminution in RBC, Ht, Hb was observed. Among reticulocytes indexes an increase of number and of the percentage of younger cells was observed together with an increase of the percentage of hypochromic reticulocytes. Among iron metabolism parameters only an increase of serum soluble transferrin receptor was observed. In authors' experience, despite iron i.v. supplementation, the insurgence of IDE was observed. The best markers to recognize this situation is the serum transferrin soluble receptor, the study of new reticulocytes indexes may bee useful too. The aim is to present the rate of transfusion therapy at the Children's Hospital Zagreb, distribution of transfusion treated children according to clinical departments, and blood products most commonly used from 1999 till the end of 2003. During 2002 we started to analyze data on transfusion therapy at meetings or individually with clinicians in order to change evidence-based unjustified blood treatment. Data were obtained from medical documentation. During the study period 2679 patients underwent T&S pretransfusion testing. A total of 3739 crossmatch tests were performed, of which 69% of units were transfused. A total of 75 neonates and 1086 children were treated with blood and blood products: 603 of them at Intensive Care Unit, 182 at Department of Solid tumours, 250 at Surgical departments and 106 at Department of Pediatrics. Analyzing the use of particular blood products, platelets were given to 197 patients, red cells products to 802 and FFP to 390 patients. In last 2 years there are significant less unjustified transfusion treatments, especially with FFP. The required improvement of transfusion therapy was achieved by long-term monitoring of transfusion therapy, analysis of the present state, and evidence-based recommendations for rational use of blood products. Tight cooperation between clinicians and transfusiologists is a precondition for choosing the best solution for transfusion treatment. There is still a space for the improvements. In our department 11 147 deliveries have been screened. Those with alloimmunisation were (0.44%): 20 anti-D, three D + C, one D + C + Jka, 11 c, seven E, one e, three Kell, one Kell + Jkb, one E + Fya, one E + Jka, one M. Antibodies' (Ab) titration was performed with microcolumn method. In some cases was possible to confirm titration with IIF method. Abs' titration at delivery was ranging between 1/4 and 1/ 4000 for anti-D Ab. The four 'Kell' patients showed an Abs' titration not very high (1/32-1/64) while all the 'c' patients had a low quantity of Ab (1/8-1/16). Patients who needed the hardest care were those with anti-D Ab. Three out of 20 anti-D patients showed fetal anaemia and hydrops fetalis in the second trimester and required intrauterine transfusion. All three babies received exanguino transfusion at delivery. Haemoglobin (Hb) at delivery was ranging from 4 to 6 g/dl and mean HCT was 20.6%. Bilirubin had a peak of 20 g/dl. Later they received RBC and EPO. At 3 months, two out of three babies showed a persistent high anti-D titration and an apparent zero Rh-negative blood group. Indirect IgG subclass determination showed a persistent high titration of IgG1 and IgG3, confirming they are the best value correlated with haemolytic risk. All newborns received therapy with intravenous IG and UV. At five month they did not show abnormalities, Hb and bilirubin range was in the norm. What we can observe is that a close collaboration between gynaecologists, newborn assistants and transfusion specialists was successful for all HDN patients. Results: A total of 431 (22.2%) neonates out of 1936 received transfusion.56.4% neonates who received transfusion, were transfused repeatedly. The need of multiple transfusion were more in VLBW and LBW babies.72.9% VLBW and LBW babies required multiple transfusions. 70.4% transfusions were given during first 2 weeks of life. Mean of transfusion volume was 72 ml per child. The amount of blood transfused was 83.0 \u00b1 9.4, 68.1 \u00b1 33.1, 131.4 \u00b1 122.4 and 112.1 \u00b1 107.8 ml in babies with birth weight <1500,1500-1999, 2000-2499 and >2500 g, respectively. During study period, transfusion in neonates decreased from 26.9% in 2000 to 15.6% in 2003. Conclusion: A significant number of neonates in NICU require blood transfusion. Incidence of transfusion decreased due to strict vigilance for need of transfusion and reduction in sampling loss. Multiple donor exposure due to repeated transfusion need to be taken care for future action; to reduce the multiple donor exposure and to reduce the load of transfusion transmitted diseases.",
