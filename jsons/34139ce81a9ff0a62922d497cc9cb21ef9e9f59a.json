In our population, dyspnea was reported by only 42% of patients (probably because they were outpatients, thus without any respiratory distress). We noticed two otorhinolaryngological symptoms: dysgeusia and anosmia, reported by more than half of the confirmed COVID-19 patients.

Lechien et al. reported gustatory disorders in 89% of their patients (n = 342/417) and olfactory disorders in 86% (n = 357/417) [6] , these higher percentages may be explained by a selection bias with outpatients consulted at Otorhinolaryngology department.",

So, it is highly probable that some of the patients reporting anosmia and/or dysgeusia who tested negative for this RT-PCR may actually be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative results of the nasopharyngeal PCR test). Therefore, the PPV of these symptoms may even be higher for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The false negative rate of RT-PCR may be explained by a long interval between onset of the disease and PCR testing (as viral [11] . In our study, we noticed that 82% (n = 9/11) patients, who complained of dysgeusia and anosmia with PCR-negative (G2), were sample more than 5 days after the onset of symptoms. We emphasize the utility of prescribing a chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan to detect early changes due to COVID-19 in cases for which RT-PCR tests show negative results, despite a high clinical probability of COVID-19 [12] . In our series, 23/112 patients in G2 had crackling sounds heard on pulmonary auscultation, and it is probable that some of them may have presented CT scan findings enabling us to validate a diagnosis of COVID-19. In recent studies, combination of RT-PCR (on respiratory samples) and serological tests also seems to enhance the sensitivity for COVID biological diagnosis [13] .",

It is important for clinician to know the predictive values of these symptoms. In this epidemic context, RT-PCR tests are not always widely available and sometimes with long delays. Outpatients presenting with dysgeusia and/or anosmia may be considered as patients infected with COVID-19, until microbiological confirmation has been obtained (as they have a high pre-test probability to be positive for SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR). Furthermore, for patients reporting dysgeusia and/or anosmia, with a negative RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to remain vigilant before ruling out this diagnosis and to maintain hygiene precautions. It might be useful in these situations to get a deeper respiratory sample (sputum or naso-tracheal aspiration), and/ or to use other diagnostic tools (serology or thoracic CT scan). ",
