Cys acts as a nucleophile, whereas His functions as a general base.5, 6 In order to find compounds that can inhibit SARS-CoV, numerous 3CLpro inhibitors have been described, including C\n2-symmetric diols,7 bifunctional aryl boronic acids,8 keto-glutamine analogs,9 isatin derivatives,10 \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters,11 anilide,12 benzotriazole13 as well as glutamic acid and glutamine peptides possessing a trifluoromethyl ketone group as reported by us and our collaborators since 200614 and recently by another group.15 However, no effective therapy has been developed so far and it is still a matter of necessity to discover new potent structures in case the disease re-emerges.",

First, keeping the trifluoromethylketone moiety in place, we investigated chemical modifications on the side chain of Glu or Gln residue at the P1 position, in order to block the formation of the cyclic structure (Scheme 1) and modulate the hydrogen bonding ability of this P1 position toward the active site, as well as modifying the amino acid residues at the P2 and P3 positions. Second, we investigated a replacement of the chemical warhead of the inhibitor, that is, the trifluoromethyl unit, by other moieties such as electron-withdrawing thiazolyl and benzothiazolyl groups. We believe that this modification would be valuable for enhancing the reactivity of the covalent-adduct formation to the active site cysteine residue in SARS-CoV 3CLpro.",

However, compound 8a exhibited lower inhibitory activity than lead compound 1a. A plausible reason for the observed low activity could be attributed to a disruption of hydrogen bonding interactions at the P1 position with the active site of the enzyme, or an unfavorable steric hindrance to a covalent bond formation at the CF3-ketone moiety with the active site cysteine residue in the enzyme. On the other hand, replacements of P1 N,N-diethylamide in compound 8a with N-morpholine- and N,N-methylbenzyl-amides increased the inhibitory activity (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). Indeed, the activity of compounds 8b and 8c with K\ni values of 21.0 and 34.1 \u03bcM, respectively, was fivefold higher affinity than reference compound 1a. Next, to develop smaller sized inhibitors, we prepared CF3-ketone compounds 8d and 8e containing the same P1 structure as compound 8a but different peptide chain lengths, because peptide chain length plays a significant role in the inhibition of enzymes by forming crucial hydrogen bonding interactions. However, the observed change in activity was negligible with either an increase or decrease of one residue in the peptide chain length (compare entries 3, 6 and 7).",

Moreover, when the pyrrolidine structure was adapted to the P1 side chain, thiazolylketone derivative 21 (entry 4) drastically increased inhibitory activity with a K\ni value of 2.2 \u03bcM. Slightly smaller and rigid cyclic amide structure seemed to be well accommodated by the S1 site. The introduction of a thiazolylketone to the P1 side chain resulted in a compound (entry 5) that exhibited decreased but relatively strong activity (K\ni = 45.2 \u03bcM) in comparison to pyrrolidine derivative 21. Inhibitory activity was again decreased by reducing the peptide chain length of compound 14b (compare entries 3, 6 and 7). A little improvement in inhibitory activity was observed when the warhead thiazole was replaced by a benzothiazole (compare entries 3, 7\u20139).

Several energy minimization processes with an MMFF94x force field were additionally performed in a water soak environment around the inhibitor, followed by a molecular dynamics simulation. During the simulation, the moieties from P1 to P3 interacted in a similar manner as the original ligand except for the thiazolyl ketone and benzyloxycarbonyl moieties (Fig. 1a). The oxoanion of the ketone generated from an attack of Cys145, interacted with the amide backbone of Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145 (Fig. 1b). The nitrogen in the thiazole was also in contact with His41 through hydrogen bonding interactions. These interactions indicate an acceptance of the unique ketone. On the other hand, the benzyloxycarbonyl group barely made hydrophobic interactions, suggesting a possibility for further optimizations of the moiety.",
