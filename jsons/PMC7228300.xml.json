Countrywide interventions include delaying the resumption of workplaces, and encouraging citizens to stay and work from home, and so on.",

For confirmed COVID\u201019 cases, reported common clinical symptoms include fever, cough, myalgia, or fatigue.\n8\n Yet these symptoms are not unique features of COVID\u201019 because these symptoms are similar to that of other virus\u2010infected diseases such as influenza.\n9\n Currently, virus nucleic acid real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), CT imaging, and some hematology parameters are the primary tools for clinical diagnosis of the infection.\n10\n Many laboratory test kits have been developed and used in testing patient specimens for COVID\u201019 by Chinese CDC, US CDC, and other private companies. The virus nucleic acid RT\u2010PCR test has become the current standard diagnostic method for the diagnosis of COVID\u201019. Yet these RT\u2010PCR test kits suffer from many limitations: (1) These tests have long turnaround times and are complicated in operation; they generally take on average over 2 to 3 hours to generate results. (2) The PCR tests require certified laboratories, expensive equipment, and trained technicians to operate. (3) There are some numbers of false negatives for RT\u2010PCR of COVID\u201019.\n11\n These limitations make RT\u2010PCR unsuitable for use in the field for rapid and simple diagnosis and screening of patients. It limits the outbreak containment effort. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a rapid, simple to use, sensitive, and accurate test to quickly identify infected patients of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to prevent virus transmission and to assure timely treatment of patients.",

It is widely accepted that immunoglobulin M (IgM) provides the first line of defense during viral infections, Before the generation of adaptive, high\u2010affinity IgG responses that are important for long term immunity and immunological memory.\n12\n It was reported that after SARS infection, IgM antibody could be detected in patient blood after 3 to 6 days and IgG could be detected after 8 days.\n13\n, \n14\n Since COVID\u201019 belongs to the same large family of viruses as those that cause the MERS and SARS outbreak, we assume its antibody generation process is similar, and detection of the IgG and IgM antibody against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 will be an indication of infection. Furthermore, detection of IgM antibodies tends to indicate recent exposure to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, whereas the detection of COVID\u201019 IgG antibodies indicates virus exposure some time ago. Thus, we believe that the detection of both IgM and IgG could provide information on the virus infection time course. The rapid detection of both IgM and IgG antibodies will add value to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID\u201019 disease.",

The presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG and IgM antibodies are indicated by a red/purple line in the specific region indicated on the device. The SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 rapid IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test strip, as shown in Figure 1, has two mouse anti\u2010human monoclonal antibodies (anti\u2010IgG and anti\u2010IgM) stripped on two separated test lines. A surface antigen from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 which can specifically bind to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies (including both IgM and IgG) is conjugated to colloidal gold nanoparticles and sprayed on conjugation pads. The AuNP\u2010rabbit IgG conjugates were also sprayed on conjugation pads for binding to anti\u2010rabbit IgG antibody which is immobilized on the control line (Figure 1A).",

The mechanism of the assay is based on the hydration and transport of reagents as they interact with the specimen across the strip via chromatographic lateral flow (Figure 1A). As the specimen flows through the device, anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG and IgM antibodies, if present in the specimen, are bound by the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antigen labeled gold colorimetric reagent fixed on the conjugate pad. As the conjugated sample continues to travel up the strip, the anti\u2010 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgM antibodies are bound on the M(IgM) line, and the anti\u2010COVID\u201019 IgG antibodies are bound to the G (IgG) line. If the specimen does not contain SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies, no labeled complexes bind at the test zone and no lines could be observed. The remaining colloidal gold travels up the nitrocellulose to the control line zone, which captures the excess conjugate demonstrating that the fluid has migrated adequately through the device. A reddish\u2010purple line will appear at the control line zone during the performance of all valid tests whether the sample is positive or negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. During the test, excess reagent including AuNP\u2010rabbit IgG conjugates migrate passes the control line zone, where the AnNP\u2010rabbit IgG conjugates bind to anti\u2010rabbit IgG to form a red line on the control line. Figure 1B is the illustration of different testing results reading for negative, IgM positive, IgG positive and IgM/IgG both positive situations.",

Patient fingerstick blood and vein blood and plasma from the same patient were tested. As shown in Table 3, seven COVID\u201019 patients and three healthy volunteers were recruited. We took the blood samples from fingerstick, serum of venous blood, and plasma of venous blood and tested them with the kits.

However, there were still false positive and false\u2010negative results (Table 1). The reasons for the false\u2010negative maybe, first, due to the low antibody concentrations. When IgM and IgG levels are below the detection limit (not determined yet) of this rapid test, the test results will be negative. Second, the difference in individual immune response antibody production could be one reason for the false\u2010negative results in COVID\u201019 patients. The last but not least, IgM antibody will decrease and disappear after 2 weeks. In some cases, it is hard to know exactly when the patient was infected or how long the patient was infected. Thus, when the patient was tested, the IgM level might well be below its peak and not detectable by this test. Therefore, we encourage more research and development of the COVID\u201019 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test kit to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for patients. Since COVID\u201019 recombinant antigen was used in the test, our test is specific for COVID\u201019 infection. The clinical testing data in this paper at different clinical sites from east, south, west, and middle of China confirmed the specificity of the test kit. However, because of the emergency of the outbreak of COVID\u201019, we could not carry out normal research activities and perform enough tests to verify if there is interference from other IgM and IgG induced by different virus infections such as typical flu viruses.

It can be performed at the bedside, in any clinic or laboratory, at airports or at railway stations.\n16\n It will be more convenient to use fingerstick blood or heel blood instead of vein blood for out\u2010of\u2010clinic screening. Our initial test results using fingertip blood were as good as that of vein blood (Table 3), which suggests that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test kits can be developed as agents for rapid field detection. Another potential application of this test is screening asymptomatic SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 carriers, it was reported that asymptomatic carriers could spread SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus.\n17\n, \n18\n This finding made the current COVID\u201019 outbreak control more difficult, because there is no method available to screen asymptomatic carriers.

At least some if not all of the carriers are likely to have anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies, as demonstrated by asymptomatic Zika virus carriers.\n19\n Because this test can detect IgM and IgG simultaneously, it could be used for both early diagnosis (IgM) and for monitoring during treatment. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection starts at the lungs, not in the upper respiratory tract,\n8\n therefore, sampling during the early infection stage using throat swab or sputum may not detect the virus. This is one possible explanation for high false negatives in the nucleic acid PCR test. However, this sampling effect should not have any effect on IgM and IgG detection with this rapid test.",
