Unfortunately, the development of a vaccine or an antiviral agent is time consuming and lagging. With the promotion of antibody production technologies, human antibodies will gain more uses, as they have been demonstrated as more secure and effective. Previously, our group isolated neutralizing antibodies from patients who recovered from H7N9 infection [42, 43]. Here, we report the generation of a fully human neutralizing antibody, MCA1, which binds to the MERS-CoV RBD.

Treatment with 3B11 reduced lung pathology in infected rhesus monkeys; however, because viral RNA was undetectable in both model and neutralizing antibody\u2013treated animals, the precise in vivo inhibitory effect of this antibody remains hard to determine. As the only neutralizing antibody from a MERS-CoV survivor, LCA60 was capable of higher neutralizing activity (showing 10-fold more potency than 3B11) [47]. However, the anti-MERS efficacy for LCA60 in primates has not yet been reported. Another nonhuman primate model with the common marmoset has been developed, in which marmosets are intratracheally infected with MERS-CoV. This model supports viral growth and shows evidence of histological lesions, progressive severe pneumonia, and high viral titers in the lungs and trachea, mimicking severe MERS disease in humans, which will ensure a better preclinical analysis of treatments before proceeding to clinical trials in humans [34].",

Among these residues, W535 primarily bound to G91 of the light chain, and other residues involved in interactions with the heavy chain of MCA1. Moreover, residues Y540, R542, and Q544 on the RBD formed the hydrophobic cavity and interacted with the surrounding MCA1 residues G98, D99, T100, and S28 of the heavy chain. It is plausible that MCA1 forms hydrogen bonds with the epitopes on the RBD and occupies the binding sites for DPP4, interfering with viral recognition of the human cellular receptor.",
