These methods are lengthy, costly and require technical laboratory training. On the therapeutic front, prevention or treatment of viral infection typically relies on neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against target epitopes on the viral surface. Production of NAbs can be triggered by vaccines or active viruses in the host. However, NAbs may induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection (for example, with DENV37), where antibodies generate increased viral infectivity in vivo, or may not provide protection against new epidemics as a result of genetic drift (for example, antigenic drift in influenza38). A customizable molecular scaffold strategy capable of incorporating sensing motifs with pathogen-specific binders and patterns may address these issues on both fronts.",

By connecting the clusters of ED3 sites linearly, we determined that a star shape, consisting of an interior pentagon connected to five exterior triangles, would provide an optimal multivalent scaffold (Fig. 1a). The viral diameter of DENV is 50 nm (ref. 39) and vector distances were measured using PyMOL. The distance between adjacent trivalent\u2013trivalent clusters was 15.1 nm and the distance between adjacent trivalent\u2013pentavalent clusters was 14.1 nm. The following equation was used to calculate the orthodromic distances needed to design the scaffold:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{array}{lll}{\\mathrm{Orthodromic}}\\;{\\mathrm{distance}} &=& {\\mathrm{viral}}\\;{\\mathrm{diameter}}\\\\&& \\times \\sin ^{ - 1}\\left( {\\frac{{\\mathrm{cluster}}\\;{\\mathrm{inter}}\\hbox{-}{\\mathrm{distance}}}{{\\mathrm{viral}}\\;{\\mathrm{diameter}}}} \\right)\\end{array}$$\\end{document}Orthodromicdistance=viraldiameter\u00d7sin\u22121clusterinter-distanceviraldiameterThe orthodromic centre-to-centre distances between trivalent\u2013trivalent and trivalent\u2013pentavalent clusters were 15.3 nm and 14.3 nm, respectively. Based on this structural information, the star-shaped DNA scaffold (DNA star) was then designed to not only match the local, orthodromic distances between ED3 clusters but also mirror the global pattern of ED3 clusters aligning with the star\u2019s ten vertices (Fig. 1b).",

Our non-denaturing PAGE showed a distinct, major band corresponding to each of the 2D architectures, confirming that DNA star structures were formed with high efficiency (Fig. 1c). It is also worth noting that the AFM probe can damage or displace the thin DNA tile-based structures during the scan (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The aptamer exhibited weak binding to DENV, as determined by surface plasmon resonance (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, the binding strength increased as aptamers were placed onto scaffolds that increasingly matched the pattern of ED3 sites on DENV with the DNA star showing the greatest binding avidity (Supplementary Fig. 3). 6-FAM (fluorophore) and BHQ-1 (quencher) carrying strands were hybridized to each inner edge, flanking the hairpin to turn the DNA star\u2013aptamer complex into a viral sensor. In the absence of DENV, FAM and BHQ-1 molecules would be brought together by canonical Watson\u2013Crick base pairing in the stem, much like a molecular beacon45. However, unlike a molecular beacon, which gives a fluorescent readout of target nucleic acid hybridization events, here the hairpins are pulled apart and converted to ssDNA as a result of strong aptamer binding to ED3 sites. The potent multivalent interactions, promoted by the matched geometric aptamer\u2013ED3 pattern, separated the FAM fluorophores from BHQ-1 quenchers to afford a fluorescent readout.",

To exclude the possibility that the series of DENV-mixed DNA star sensing signals obtained within 1\u20132 min resulted from an automatic (non-target-triggered) separation of the fluorophores from quenchers, we measured fluorescent readouts over time at different temperatures. Fluorescent measurements over time showed that the FAM fluorophores remained quenched during the duration required for sensing and functioned at different temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 4). To examine the specificity of our sensor, we tested it against another virus available to us, the adenovirus. If the star\u2013aptamer complex does not recognize the virus through proper binding, the complex will remain quenched (Fig. 2b).

In correlation with our DENV sensing data, the hexagon scaffold provided the second most potent inhibitory effect, with an EC50 value of 10 nM, while the heptagon scaffold exhibited poor inhibition, with an EC50 value of 440 nM. The flexible linear scaffold provided better inhibition, at an EC50 of 90 nM, than the bivalent scaffold, at an EC50 of 130 nM. Additionally, as previous studies predicted, potentially matching the spacing could increase the inhibitory effect as all the structures proved to be more potent than the monovalent aptamer.",

Interestingly, the 2D heptagon scaffold exhibited worse inhibitory potency than the 1D bivalent and flexible linear scaffolds. A mismatch of a fixed geometric pattern, while keeping the same initial spacing, leads to reduced inhibition potency when compared to flexibly matching the spacing. In summary, the more the binders match the 2D pattern of binding sites, the stronger the inhibition as aptamers bound to the star scaffold show superior performance compared to the other scaffold shapes.",

Membrane-bound structures, including the cell membrane, were stained with Dil (yellow) while cell nuclei (blue) were stained with Hoechst. DENV virions were labelled with DiD (red) and the DNA star\u2013aptamer complex was labelled with the 6-FAM fluorophore (green), quenched in the absence of DENV. When the green DNA stars and the red virions co-localize, the merged signals appear yellow. The Dil stain and 6-FAM dye also exhibit fluorescence spillover due to slightly overlapping excitation and emission spectra. The finer details between labelled structures can be resolved when viewing the merged image as separate fluorescence channels (Supplementary Fig. 8).",
