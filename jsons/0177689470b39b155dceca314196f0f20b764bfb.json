Methods: Fifty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (9 rats in each group). From the first day to the 28th day of the experiment, except to those in the sham-model control group that were treated with normal saline, the same amount of bleomycin injection as the normal saline given to the control group was given through endotracheal instillation to all the rats in all the other groups. From the 29th day of the modeling, CBRP solution of different dosages was respectively injected into the rats in the high, moderate and low CBRP dose group, while equal volume of normal saline was given to those in the sham-model control group and the model control group, and an equal volume of prednisone solution was given to rats in the prednisone group. On the 80th day, the high-resolution computerized tomographic (HRCT) images were observed on an equal footing, and HRCT-pathology was correlatively studied. Results: Different HRCT pathological changes were shown in the rats with pulmonary fibrosis, such as lung consolidation, thickening of interlobular septum and interlobular mesenchyma as well as lobular deformation, nodule shadow, abnormal brochiovascular tract, thickened pleura with irregular junction and polished glass-like dense shadows. Honeycomb lung was observed in some cases. Pathological sections showed fibrotic proliferation of lung tissues and noticeable pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. CBRP could improve HRCT images of rats with pulmonary fibrosis, and lower fibrotic proliferation of the lung tissue. Conclusion: CBRP plays its therapeutic role possibly through its effect on the structure of the lung in rats with pulmonary fibrosis.",

Its pathogenic cause is still unknown, and the prognosis is unfavourable. For cases at the primary stage, even if they positively respond to steroid therapy, the survival time is about 5 years. The currently used therapeutic methods mainly by adrenocortical hormones and immunosuppressants have proved to be unsatisfactory because of significant adverse reactions (1) In recent years, great progress has been achieved when TCM drugs are used in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, and Compound Biejia Ruangan Prescription (CBRP) has been found to have a definite clinical effect on liver fibrosis. To probe into the therapeutic effect of CBRP on pulmonary fibrosis, we, by means of high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT), observed the effect of CBRP on pathological histology of the bleomycin-induced rats with pulmonary fibrosis so as to provide a new drug in clinical treatment of the disease.",

Fig. 5 and 6 showed respectively the correlation between the frequency of HRCT image changes and the accumulated scores of alveolitis and fibrosis @1=0.8159, r2=0.8159, both P--0.001,n = 54), suggesting that they were highly correlated.

With the pathogenic causes unknown, the disease is of very low curative rate and survival rate.

The exactness of HRCT in diagnosing pulmonary fibrosis was also confirmed by Ganesh, et al (19) , though with the sensitivity lower than that of lung biopsy. Moreover, Mogulkoc, et al (19) indicated that HRCT image, which related to pulmonary physiological indexes to a certain extent, was an objective criterion for determining the necessity of performing lung transplantation in the patient with pulmonary fibrosis. Ganesh, et al (2~ discovered that, though the sensitivity of HRCT image was lower than that of open biopsy of the lung, it has rather higher accuracy in the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. To sum up, HRCT image is superior to the routine CT and X-ray chest film in diagnosing pulmonary fibrosis, because it is possible to make an objective iconographic evaluation pulmonary functions and pathological changes in the lung, and hence provides an effective guidance for clinical treatment and an objective basis for clinical evaluation of certain drugs.",

Along with the development of the disease, there reveals a decrease of inflammatory cell exudation and infiltration, and an increase of proliferation of fibroblast and collagenous fibers, which thickens alveolar walls, deforms and destroys alveoli. It might involve alveolar ductules and bronchiole to cause thickening and structural changes in interlobular septum and interlobular mesenchyma, and abnormal brochiovascular bundle. Due to gradually weakened air exchange function and finally total exhaustion of air of alveoli, pulmonary consolida-tion resulted. Polished glass-like shadows are the signs of alveolitis and inflammatory infiltration. Interstitial alveolitis and proliferated fibrosis are also the pathological bases of nodule shadow and abnormal brochiovascular bundle. Irritative inflammation usually activates fibroblasts, and these fibrotic changes can also be verified by pathological examination.",
