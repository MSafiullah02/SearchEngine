These samples were examined by an N-gene-specific quantitative RT-PCR assay, as described elsewhere.3 The viral loads in throat swab and sputum samples peaked at around 5\u20136 days after symptom onset, ranging from around 104 to 107 copies per mL during this time (figure A, B\n). This pattern of changes in viral load is distinct from the one observed in patients with SARS, which normally peaked at around 10 days after onset.4 Sputum samples generally showed higher viral loads than throat swab samples. No viral RNA was detected in urine or stool samples from these two patients.",

The only nasal swab tested in this study (taken on day 3 post-onset) showed a viral load of 1\u00b769 \u00d7 105 copies per mL. Overall, the viral load early after onset was high (>1 \u00d7 106 copies per mL). However, a sputum sample collected on day 8 post-onset from a patient who died had a very high viral load (1\u00b734 \u00d7 1011 copies per mL). Notably, two individuals, who were under active surveillance because of a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients showed positive results on RT-PCR a day before onset, suggesting that infected individuals can be infectious before them become symptomatic.",
