The case fatality rate has been as high as 15% for patients younger than 60 years old and can be higher than 50% for patients 60 years or older. Nearly 40% of patients developed respiratory failure that required assisted ventilation (De Groot, 2003). The severe morbidity and mortality associated with SARS make it imperative that effective means to prevent and treat the disease be developed and evaluated, especially since it is not known whether the virus will exhibit a seasonal pattern or whether it will be reintroduced into the human population through animal reservoirs, or laboratory accidences, or acts of terrorism.",

            "text": "The successful development of effective treatments and vaccines against SARS-CoV depends on understanding the roles of various immune effectors in protective immunity and identifying protective antigens recognized by these effector cells. Like other CoVs, SARS-CoV is an enveloped plus-stranded RNA virus with a \u223c30 kbs genome encoding replicase (Rep) gene products and the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). S protein is responsible for binding to specific cellular receptor (Li et al., 2003), E protein plays a role in viral assembly, M is important for virus budding, and N protein is associated with viral RNA packaging (Holmes, 2003). No conclusive information is available on the immune correlates of protection to SARS in patients. However, it has been reported that antibodies against SARS-CoV were detected in patients infected with SARS (Ksiazek et al., 2003). Recently, using pseudotyped lentiviral particles bearing the SARS-CoV spike protein, it has been shown that spike-mediated infection could be inhibited by sera from SARS patients, demonstrating that spike is a target for neutralizing antibodies (Hofmann et al., 2004). In addition, two identified CD8 T-cell epitopes in SARS-CoV spike protein have been shown to elicit specific T-cell responses in HLA-A2+ SARS-CoV-infected patients (Wang et al., 2004). Therefore, we initially focused on SARS-CoV spike protein as the target antigen for our vaccine development.",

However, for the early stage of product evaluation, a small animal model, such as mice, would be very useful. We (Hogan et al., 2004) and others (Subbarao et al., 2004) have shown that SARS-CoV replicates in mice although the infection is self-limited. To study antigen-specific immune responses in mice, MHC I-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes need to be identified. Vectors based on replication-defective adenoviruses are capable of high-level gene transfer and activation of T and B cells to the transgene product (van Ginkel et al., 1997, Yang et al., 1996). These properties have been exploited in the development of genetic subunit vaccines (Sullivan et al., 2000, Xiang et al., 1996). Therefore, several versions of replication-defective adenoviral vectors expressing spike protein were created to induce spike-specific T cell responses in mice and to screen for CD8 T-cell epitopes using an overlapping peptide library spanning the entire spike protein in IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT and intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining assays. Here, we report the detailed mapping of both H-2b- and H-2d-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes from codon-optimized spike protein. These results provide critical information for analyzing CD8 T-cell responses in murine models of SARS-CoV infection and for developing spike-based SARS-CoV vaccines. More importantly, a single administration of the optimized SARS-CoV spike vaccine vectors based on replication-defective human and simian adenovirus can generate strong spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses in mice.",

Splenocytes were harvested at 8 days after immunization and subjected to IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay with pools of overlapping peptides from spike protein. Of all peptide pools screened, pools 9, 11, and 18 showed specific IFN-\u03b3 responses in C57BL/6. The remaining pools, as exemplified by pool 5, showed no specific response (Fig. 1A). Pools 9 and 11 were selected for mapping the individual peptide(s) responsible for stimulating IFN-\u03b3 expressing T cells. Peptide 87 (TSTGNYNYKYRYLRH, corresponding to S431\u2013445) and peptide 88 (YNYKYRYLRHGKLRP, corresponding to S436\u2013450) within pool 9 and peptide 105 (KNQCVNFNFNGLTGT, corresponding to S521\u2013535) and peptide 106 (NFNFNGLTGTGVLTP, corresponding to S526\u2013540) within pool 11 were identified as the major positive peptides responsible for specific stimulation of T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 1B). Based on the SYFPEITHI algorithm (Rammensee et al., 1999), several potential CD8 T-cell epitopes for SARS-CoV spike protein in C57BL/6 mice were identified. Table 1\nshowed their sequences, positions, and scores. Indeed, YNYKYRYL (S436\u2013443) completely present in peptides 87 and 88 was predicted to have strong binding affinity for H2-Kb; while VNFNFNGL (S525\u2013532) completely present in peptide 105 and partially present in peptide 106 was predicted to have weak binding affinity for H2-Kb. Since ELISPOT assay cannot readily distinguish antigen-specific CD4 T-cell responses from antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses, the immunized splenocytes were further subjected to intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining after stimulating in vitro with peptides 87 and 105 (Fig. 2\n). Subsequently, the predicted optimal CD8 T-cell epitopes, YNYKYRYL resided in peptide 87 and VNFNFNGL resided in peptide 105, were synthesized and used to stimulate immunized splenocytes in vitro for IFN-\u03b3 secretion (Fig. 2). As predicted, YNYKYRYL and peptides 87 gave much stronger CD8 T-cell responses than VNFNFNGL and peptides 105. Furthermore, optimal epitopes, YNYKYRYL and VNFNFNGL, were able to induce IFN-\u03b3 responses in CD8 T cells either as effectively as or more effectively than their parental 15 mers, respectively. In conclusion, a single administration of a replication-defective human adenoviral vaccine vector encoding codon-optimized spike can generate strong spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses. We also identified two optimal CD8 T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV spike in C57BL/6 mice.",

T cells activation was measured by intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining (Fig. 3\n).

            "text": "BALB/c mice were immunized in a similar fashion as C57BL/6 mice. Using ELISPOT assay, pools 7, 8, and 9 showed specific IFN-\u03b3 responses in BALB/c. The remaining pools, as exemplified by pool 5, showed no specific response (Fig. 4A). We focused on pools 8 and 9 because of the stronger responses observed with these pools. Subsequently, peptide 73 (FSTFKCYGVSATKLN, corresponding to S361\u2013375) and peptide 74 (CYGVSATKLNDLCFS, corresponding to S366\u2013380) within pool 8 and peptide 87 (TSTGNYNYKYRYLRH, corresponding to S431\u2013445) and peptide 88 (YNYKYRYLRHGKLRP, corresponding to S436\u2013450) within pool 9 were identified as the major positive peptides responsible for specific stimulation of T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4B). Based on the SYFPEITHI algorithm (Rammensee et al., 1999), several potential CD8 T-cell epitopes for SARS-CoV spike protein in BALB/c mice were identified. Table 2\nshowed their sequences, positions, and scores. Indeed, CYGVSATKL (S366\u2013374) completely present in peptides 73 and 74 was predicted to have strong binding affinity for H2-Kd; while NYNYKYRYL (S435\u2013443) completely present in peptide 87 and partially present in peptide 88 was predicted to have weak binding affinity for H2-Kd. The immunized splenocytes were also subjected to intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining after stimulating in vitro with these positive 15 mers. Notably, there was no significant IFN-\u03b3 production from CD8 T cells stimulated with peptides 87 and 88 by intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining (Fig. 5\nA), even though both peptides gave strong responses in IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay (Fig. 4B). This suggested that peptides 87 and 88 may contain a CD4 T-cell epitope that stimulated CD4 T-cell responses in IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay. In contrast, peptide 74 can significantly stimulate CD8 T-cell responses (Fig. 5B). Subsequently, the predicted optimal CD8 T-cell epitope, CYGVSATKL resided in peptide 74, was synthesized and used to stimulate immunized splenocytes in vitro for IFN-\u03b3 secretion (Fig. 5B). The results indicated that peptide 74 indeed contained an H-2d-restricted CD8 T-cell epitope. As expected, optimal epitope was able to induce IFN-\u03b3 responses in CD8 T cells more effectively than its parental 15 mer. Collectively, we have identified one optimal CD8 T-cell epitope of SARS-CoV spike in BALB/c mice. The dose responses of this CD8 T-cell epitope for T cells activation in vitro were also determined as described above (Fig. 6\n). The results suggested that about 100-fold more peptides were needed to fully activate T cells in vitro with this H-2d-restricted CD8 T-cell epitope compared to those with two H-2b-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes (Fig. 3). Furthermore, peptides 87 and 88 may contain a CD4 T-cell epitope of SARS-CoV spike in BALB/c mice.",

            "text": "To circumvent the potential problem that neutralizing antibodies to human adenovirus serotype 5 vector by previous natural infections will impair its efficacy as vaccine carrier, our lab recently developed a series of novel replication-defective adenoviral vaccine carriers based on simian serotypes (Fitzgerald et al., 2003, Pinto et al., 2003). AdC7, one of those carriers, is able to induce robust transgene-specific CD8 T-cell responses in immunized mice (Kobinger et al., submitted for publication). Three replication-defective simian adenovirus serotype 7-based vaccine vectors encoding either wild-type spike driven by CMV promoter (AdC7.CMVSpike) or codon-optimized spike driven by CMV promoter (AdC7.CMVnSpike) or codon-optimized spike driven by a hybrid promoter CAG2 (AdC7.CAG2nSpike) were created and used to immunize mice. CAG2 promoter was created by deleting a 955-bp ApaI/AflII fragment from the original CAGGS promoter (Niwa et al., 1991). Similar to the negative results observed when AdHu5.CMVSpike was used to immunize mice, there was no detectable stimulation of an IFN-\u03b3 response in T cells with any of the identified positive pools using ELISPOT assay when AdC7.CMVSpike was used for immunization (data not shown). In contrast, spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses were observed when AdC7.CMVnSpike vector was used to immunize C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 8\n). However, the magnitude of spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses was much lower than that observed in mice immunized with AdHu5.CMVnSpike vector (Fig. 8). In order to further improve the immunogenicity of spike protein delivered by the simian adenoviral vaccine carrier, AdC7.CAG2nSpike vector was created. Chicken \u03b2-actin promoter has been shown to increase expression of SARS-CoV spike protein in transfected cells (Simmons et al., 2004). Spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses in C57BL/6 mice elicited by AdC7.CAG2nSpike vector were examined by intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining (Fig. 8). The result indicated that codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity of SARS-CoV spike protein in the context of simian adenoviral vaccine carrier. More importantly, a single administration of an optimized SARS-CoV spike vaccine vector based on a replication-defective simian adenovirus can generate strong spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses in mice.",

Expression of spike protein in Ad vector-infected 293T cells was examined by Western blot analysis and the bands representing spike protein were quantified by ImageQuant5.1. Forty-three-fold increase of protein expression was achieved when CAG2 promoter, instead of CMV promoter, was used in the simian adenoviral C7 vector (Fig. 9\n, lanes 4 and 6), while 7-fold increase of protein expression was achieved when codon optimization of spike protein was applied (Fig. 9, lanes 5 and 6).

            "text": "SARS-CoV represents an emerging threat. Currently, no effective therapies or vaccines exist, and relatively little is known about the pathogenesis of the virus. It has been shown that 293T cells transfected with a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), formed multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing spike protein (Li et al., 2003). More significantly, in the post-mortem lung tissue samples from patients who died from SARS, multinucleate giant cells of macrophage and epithelial origins have been observed within the damaged alveoli (Nicholls et al., 2003). In addition, CD8 T-cell responses are necessary for clearance of other CoVs, such as mouse hepatitis virus (Sussman et al., 1989, Williamson and Stohlman, 1990). Therefore, eradication of SARS-CoV may not be achieved by humoral response alone and T cell-mediated immunity may be also required to clear infection. To study more closely cellular immune responses in murine model, MHC I-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes need to be identified. In this study, we have identified two octamers (S436\u2013443 and S525\u2013532) as H-2b-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes and one nonamer (S366\u2013374) as an H-2d-restricted CD8 T-cell epitope. In C57BL/6 mice, one epitope is more dominant than the other in immunized mice. The strength of these epitopes appeared to correlate with the binding affinity to H2-Kb predicted by SYFPEITHI algorithm. In the preliminary study, splenocytes were collected from C57BL/6 mice immunized with AdC7.CAG2nSpike vector and in vitro cultured in the presence of the dominant H-2b-restricted CD8 T-cell epitope for a week. Subsequently, the cultured splenocytes were subjected to ELISPOT assay stimulated with MC57SV cells (H-2Db, a cell line derived from B6 mice) previously infected with either AdHu5.Null or AdHu5.CMVnSpike vector. The initial results indicated that cultured splenocytes were able to induce higher level of IFN-\u03b3 response after stimulated with AdHu5.CMVnSpike vector-infected MC57SV cells than after stimulated with AdHu5.Null vector-infected MC57SV cells. These data suggested that T cells raised to the epitope were able to recognize cells expressing the spike protein and that the identified CD8 epitope is naturally processed and presented by cells. Currently, additional experiments are underway to address this issue more thoroughly.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are common and worldwide pathogens that infect a variety of mammals and birds. These viruses have been classified into three groups. Although SARS-CoV exhibits a similar genome structure, it is only distantly related to known CoVs and \u2018most like\u2019 Group 2 CoVs, which includes bovine, murine, and human viruses (Snijder et al., 2003). The most commonly studied coronavirus is mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), in part because the natural host for this infection, the mouse, is more easily managed in the laboratory. Two spike-specific CD8 T-cell epitopes (dominant S510\u2013518 and subdominant S598\u2013605) were identified in MHV-infected C57BL/6 mice (Bergmann et al., 1996, Castro and Perlman, 1995), while no spike-specific CD8 T-cell epitope has been recognized in MHV-infected BALB/c mice. The dominant S510\u2013518 epitope is located in a hypervariable region of spike protein that appears to be readily deleted without loss of viability of MHV (Parker et al., 1989). In contrast, it was impossible to recover infectious virus with mutations in the subdominant S598\u2013605 epitope (personal communication, M.M. Chua and S.R. Weiss). Examination of SARS-CoV spike sequence reveals that three CD8 T-cell epitopes are present in the S1 domain of the spike protein. Specifically, the dominant CD8 T-cell epitope in C57BL/6 (S436\u2013443) and the CD8 T-cell epitope in BALB/c (S366\u2013374) both reside in the minimal region of S1 required for interaction with its cellular receptor (Babcock et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004). Several spike-specific CD4 T-cell epitopes have also been reported in MHV-infected mice (Heemskerk et al., 1995, Xue and Perlman, 1997). CD4 T cells are needed to help CD8 cells for viral clearance (Stohlman et al., 1998, Sussman et al., 1989, Williamson and Stohlman, 1990). In this study, we clearly showed that both peptide 87 and peptide 88 were able to specifically stimulate immunized CD4 T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 in vitro. However, the exact sequences of CD4 T-cell epitope in the 431\u2013450 region of spike protein remain to be further elucidated.",

In this study, we demonstrated that codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity of spike protein in replication-defective human and simian adenoviral vaccine vectors. We showed that the expression of spike protein in vitro was greatly increased by expression cassette optimization. This provided useful information for developing spike-based SARS-CoV genetic vaccines. More importantly, this may provide us a platform to quickly generate genetic vaccine vectors based on simian adenovirus. Namely, CAG2 but not CMV promoter should be used in simian adenoviral vaccine vector. Currently, we are testing this hypothesis with other viral antigens. Since the CMV promoter has been widely used in human adenoviral vectors, it is surprising to see the inferior performance of CMV promoter in simian adenoviral vector. One possibility is that certain viral sequences only present in simian adenoviral vector have negative effects on CMV promoter activity. The other possibility is that certain inflammatory cytokines induced by simian adenoviral vector may inhibit CMV promoter activity.",

            "text": "Recently, a strategy involving priming with DNA vaccine and boosting with adenoviral vaccine vectors, each expressing a similar antigen, has resulted in the generation of unparalleled levels of specific immunity and afforded protection against infectious agents in animal models (Shiver et al., 2002, Sullivan et al., 2000). Nevertheless, DNA vaccines have performed poorly in clinical trials so far (MacGregor et al., 1998, Wang et al., 2001), and it is thus uncertain whether DNA vaccine prime followed by adenoviral vaccine vector boost will be as efficacious in humans as in preclinical experimental animal studies. Therefore, we developed an additional replication-defective adenoviral vaccine vector of chimpanzee origin to increase our repertoire of vaccine carriers that can be given sequentially (Fitzgerald et al., 2003, Pinto et al., 2003, Pinto et al., 2004, Reyes-Sandoval et al., 2004, Roy et al., 2004, Xiang et al., 2002, Xiang et al., 2003a, Xiang et al., 2003b, Xiang et al., 2003c). The toxicity of adenoviral vectors in vivo is directly related to the dose of injection. Therefore, a major benefit of prime/boost strategy is the potential to significantly reduce the dose for immunization in order to achieve a high level of immune responses. In this study, we showed that both AdHu5.CMVnSpike and AdC7.CAG2nSpike vaccine vectors could induce robust spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses in immunized mice alone. Currently, we are studying whether strong CD8 T-cell responses can be achieved when mice were primed and boosted with these heterologous adenoviral vaccine vectors at a much lower dose.",

Blots were blocked with 8% milk diluted in TBS/Tween 20 (TBS/T) for 45 min, washed three times (10 min each) with TBS/T, and probed with primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibody consisted of whole serum isolated from rabbits inoculated with purified spike protein diluted in 5% milk/TBS to a final concentration of 1:500. The blots were then washed three times with TBS/T before being incubated with secondary antibody for 45 min at room temperature and washed again three times with TBS/T. Secondary antibody was anti-rabbit HRP diluted in 5% milk/TBS to a final concentration of 1:2000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Protein Bands were developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and exposed on Kodak Biomax film. The Western blot image was scanned and the interested protein bands were quantified by ImageQuant5.1 (Molecular Dynamics).",
