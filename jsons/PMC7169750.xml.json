            "text": "Rotaviruses (RVs) are a major cause of intestinal disease in animals, including weaned piglets and young children (Vlasova, Amimo, & Saif, 2017). RVs form a genus of the Reoviridae family and contain a genome consisting of 11 double\u2010stranded RNA segments. The RV genome encodes six structural viral proteins (VPs; VP1\u2010VP4, VP6 and VP7) and five or six non\u2010structural proteins (NSP1\u2010NSP5/6) (Ramig, 1997). The RV VP6 protein has been used to differentiate RV species by classifying them into 10 groups from group A rotavirus (RVA) to group J rotavirus (RVJ) (Banyai et al., 2017; Matthijnssens et al., 2012; Mihalov\u2010Kovacs et al., 2015). Continuous RV classification is being performed by the Rega Instituut, KU Leuven (Belgium) (https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/viralmetagenomics/virus-classification/7th-RCWG-meeting). The most common group infecting humans and animals is RVA, which causes acute dehydrating diarrhoea (Vlasova et al., 2017).",

Due to the high genetic diversity of RVA strains, the dual typing system (G and P genotypes) was extended to a whole\u2010genome sequence classification system with all 11 gene segments (Matthijnssens, Ciarlet, Heiman et al., 2008a). The classification and nomenclature of RVA genes is Gx\u2010P[x]\u2010Ix\u2010Rx\u2010Cx\u2010Mx\u2010Ax\u2010Nx\u2010Tx\u2010Ex\u2010Hx, where x indicates the corresponding number of genotypes (Matthijnssens et al., 2011). To date, 32 G, 47 P, 24 I, 18 R, 17 C, 17 M, 28 A, 18 N, 19 T, 24 E and 19 H genotypes have been identified among RVAs from humans and animals (Esona et al., 2017), as described at the 7th RCWG meeting (https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/viralmetagenomics/virus-classification/7th-RCWG-meeting) at Rega Instituut, KU Leuven (Belgium). In pigs, 12 G genotypes (G1 to G6, G8 to G12 and G26) and 16 P genotypes (P[1] to P[8], P[13], P[19], P[23], P[26], P[27], P[28], P[32] and P[34]) of RVA have been identified, and G3, G4, G5, G9 and G11 usually occur in combination with P[5], P[6], P[7], P[13] and P[28], respectively (Vlasova et al., 2017).",

RVA is an important pathogen for diarrhoea in Belgian suckling pigs (Amimo et al., 2016). Epidemiological surveillance of porcine rotavirus (PoRV) conducted in Ohio, USA, showed that 9.4% of pigs were positive for RVA (Amimo, Vlasova, & Saif, 2013).

Therefore, we only compared the VP5* neutralizing epitope region of RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] with all PoRV strains from China obtained from GenBank and the RCE strains (Gottfried G4P[6], OSU G5P[7]) available in the ProSystems RCE (Merck). The results show that two aa positions (434E and 441R) in the neutralizing epitope in VP5* were conserved (Figure 3b). Five aa (306, 393, 394, 398 and 459) in the VP5* neutralizing epitope differed between RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] and the RCE strain OSU\u2010G5P[7]\u2010USA (Figure 3b).

No other Chinese strains were previously reported to contain six additional nt in the VP8* protein (Figure 4a). However, the presence of six\u2010nt gains at the same positions was found in strains from other countries, including Thailand, India, Japan, Australia, and the USA (Figure 4a). The additional six nt resulted in four aa changes (aa 184, 185, 186 and 190) and the loss of two aa from the VP8* protein (aa 188 and 189) (Figure 4a). Further analysis of the influence of these aa changes on the spatial structure of the VP8* protein was performed. The VP8* protein sequences (70\u2010210 aa) of RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] and RVA/Pig/China/NMTL were searched against the SWISS\u2010MODEL template library.

Protection against RV infection can be mediated by neutralizing antibodies that target epitopes on both VP4 and VP7 (Taniguchi et al., 1991). The structures of the neutralizing epitopes on the VP7 protein have been identified. The epitopes on the exposed surface of the VP7 protein are clustered into two regions: 7\u20101 (aa 87, 91, 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 201, 211, 213, 238 and 291) and 7\u20102 (aa 147, 148, 190, 217, 221, 223, 242 and 264) (Aoki et al., 2009). The neutralizing epitope of aa 94 to 99 was previously elucidated in the RVA VP7 protein (Mackow et al., 1988). The RV surface is decorated with 60 spikes, each of which is composed of a VP4 dimer (a viral haemagglutinin) (Tihova, Dryden, Bellamy, Greenberg, & Yeager, 2001). VP4 is a trimer at its base, on the surface only a dimer is exposed while the third monomer is folded away or removed (Settembre, Chen, Dormitzer, Grigorieff, & Harrison, 2011). Trypsin cleavage of the RVs VP4 generates two fragments (VP8* and VP5*); VP8* binds sialic acid (SA), whereas VP5* contains an integrin\u2010binding motif and a hydrophobic region that facilitate cell membrane penetration and integrin\u2010binding (Dowling, Denisova, LaMonica, & Mackow, 2000; Pesavento, Crawford, Estes, & Prasad, 2006). VP8* of RVs mediates cell attachment by interacting with histo\u2010blood group antigens (HBGAs) (Hu et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2016). The structures of the neutralizing epitopes on the VP5* and VP8* proteins have been identified. The epitopes on VP8* are clustered into four regions (8\u20101, 8\u20102, 8\u20103 and 8\u20104) (Dormitzer et al., 2004; Naseer et al., 2017). Figure 3 shows minimal differences in the neutralizing epitopes G3, G4, G5 and G9 between strains from China and the RCE strains, suggesting that the RCE strains protect against these genotypes in China. However, the PoRV P genotypes currently available in GenBank mainly are P[23]. At present, relatively few P genotypes from China can be found in GenBank. More reports of the P genotype of PoRV are needed in China, which will provide information for the prevention of PoRV and the development of PoRV vaccines.",

Recombination is considered a potential mechanism for antigenic diversity and a possible mechanism to escape from vaccine\u2010imposed selective pressure but may not contribute to the long\u2010term evolution of RVAs (Woods, 2015). Several reports have identified sequences with recombination in VP4 (Esona et al., 2017), VP6 (Jere, Mlera, Page, van Dijk, & O'Neill, 2011; Marthaler et al., 2014), VP7 (Martinez\u2010Laso et al., 2009; Parra, Bok, Martinez, & Gomez, 2004; Phan et al., 2007a, 2007b; Suzuki, Gojobori, & Nakagomi, 1998), NSP1 (Esona et al., 2017), NSP2 (Jere et al., 2011), NSP3 and NSP4 (Donker, Boniface, & Kirkwood, 2011) (Table S4). Intramolecular recombination could contribute to the development of new RVs phenotypes (Ramig, 1997). To date, no reports have demonstrated a recombinant PoRV in China. In this study, evidence for a recombination crossover event in the VP4 gene (nt 456\u2010804, aa 152\u2010268) was provided in a Chinese isolate.

Rotavirus antigens and serotypes are diverse, suggesting that obtaining extensive protective immunity requires immunization or infection with multiple antigens (Nair et al., 2017).

In developing countries, animal husbandry (i.e., cattle, sheep and pigs) is closely related to human populations, which provides potential possibilities for reassortment and recombination events. Monitoring newly emerging RVs in animals is important for the control of RVs infection in both humans and animals. The exact mechanism of recombination in rotaviruses is still unclear. Hypotheses have suggested that there may be a direct link between recombination and the formation of the secondary RNA structure, because these RNA structures induce stops, stalls or delays that favour strand invasion (Perez\u2010Losada, Arenas, Galan, Palero, & Gonzalez\u2010Candelas, 2015). The secondary structures in recombinant gene segments and in short stretches of AU\u2010rich sequence might be associated with recombination events in RVs (Esona et al., 2017). However, copy choice plays an important role in RNA virus recombination (Kirkegaard & Baltimore, 1986). Copy choice recombination might occur in RVs during plus\u2010 and minus\u2010strand RVs RNA synthesis (Desselberger, 1996). Rotavirus recombination most likely occurs during the genome transcription stage in the viral life cycle (Kojima, Taniguchi, Urasawa, & Urasawa, 1996). RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] is a recombinant virus between the P[7] and P[23] genotypes. It will be important to investigate the pathogenicity of this virus in pigs in future work.",
