            "text": "Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is one of the causes of the ''common cold'' in human during seasons of cold weather. The primary function of the HCoV-OC43 nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is to recognize viral genomic RNA, which leads to ribonucleocapsid formation. Here, we characterized the stability and identified the functional regions of the recombinant HCoV-OC43 N protein. Circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements revealed that the HCoV-OC43 N protein is more highly ordered and stabler than the SARS-CoV N protein previously studied. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments showed that the affinity of HCoV-OC43 N protein for RNA was approximately fivefold higher than that of N protein for DNA. Moreover, we found that the HCoV-OC43 N protein contains three RNA-binding regions in its N-terminal region (residues 1-173) and central-linker region (residues 174-232 and 233-300). The binding affinities of the truncated N proteins and RNA follow the order: residues 1-173-residues 233-300 > residues 174-232. SPR experiments demonstrated that the C-terminal region (residues 301-448) of HCoV-OC43 N protein lacks RNA-binding activity, while crosslinking and gel filtration analyses revealed that the C-terminal region is mainly involved in the oligomerization of the HCoV-OC43 N protein. This study may benefit the understanding of the mechanism of HCoV-OC43 nucleocapsid formation.",

            "text": "The strain OC43 of the type II coronavirus family (HCoV-OC43) was first identified in the 1960s and is responsible for $20% of all ''common colds'' in humans. 1, 2 Although HCoV-OC43 infections are generally mild, more severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections like bronchiolitis and pneumonia have been documented, especially in infants, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised patients. 1, 3, 4 Moreover, there have been reports that clusters of HCoV-OC43 infections cause pneumonia in otherwise healthy adults. 2, 5 Several studies have reported that both neurotropism and neuroinvasion of HCoV are associated with multiple sclerosis, especially in the case of the OC43 strain. 6 CoV particles have an irregular shape, which is determined by an outer envelope with distinctive, ''club-shaped.'' These peplomers give the virus a crown-like (corona) appearance. 7 The viral genome of coronaviruses consists of positive sense, singlestranded RNA of $30 kb. The genome contains several genes that encode structural and nonstructural proteins that are required for progeny virion production. 1 The virion envelope surrounding the nucleocapsid contains the following structural proteins: S (spike) protein, M (membrane),and E (envelope). A third glycoprotein, HE (hemagglutinin-esterase), is present in most class II coronaviruses. 8, 9 A helical nucleocapsid exists in the center of the viral particle. [10] [11] [12] Nucleocapsid protein, the major structural protein of CoVs, binds to the viral RNA genome to form the virion core, which leads to the formation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex or to a long helical nucleocapsid structure. 13, 14 The formation of the RNP is important for maintaining the RNA in an ordered conformation suitable for replication and transcription of the viral genome. 13, [15] [16] [17] Previous studies have shown that the CoV N protein is involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as gene transcription, actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. [18] [19] [20] [21] It has also been shown to act as an RNA chaperone. 22 Moreover, the N protein is an important diagnostic marker and the most ''immuno-dominant'' antigen in a host immune response. 17, 23, 24 Previous studies have revealed that the N-and C-terminal domains of the CoV N proteins, including those of SARS-CoV, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), are responsible for RNA binding and oligomerization, respectively. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] The central region of the N protein has also been shown to contain an RNA-binding region and the primary sites of phosphorylation. 28, 31, 32 Phosphorylation of the N protein has been shown to play an important role in virus biology. 33, 34 To clarify the molecular mechanism of ribonucleocapsid formation by CoVs, structures of truncated fragments of N protein including N-terminal and C-terminal domains have been published. 26, [35] [36] [37] Despite the conservation of some motifs, CoV N proteins from different strains often show quite different properties primarily due to their low sequence homology. 30 For example, Saikatendu et al. found that the structures of SARS-CoV and IBV N-terminal domains shared several common features, in addition to many subtle structural differences. 36 On the basis of the different crystal packing of these two structures, they suggested that the two viruses most likely use different modes of oligomeric selfassociation during RNP core formation.",

Analysis by the SELECON program revealed that HCoV-OC43 N protein contains $35.1% a-helices, 11.6% b-sheets, 23.8% turns, and 29.5% random coils at room temperature. At high temperatures, the CD spectra of HCoV-OC43 N protein showed decreased intensity between 210 and 220 nm and a large negative peak at 190 nm, which are characteristic of disordered protein. Previous CD spectra of the full-length N proteins from SARS and 229E CoVs indicated that the N protein is relatively disordered and composed of $50% nonsecondary structures. 17 Our present results suggest that the conformations of HCoV-OC43 N proteins are more ordered than those of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV N proteins [ Fig. 1(A) ]. We also measured the melting temperature (T m ) of HCoV-OC43 N proteins using CD [ Fig. 1(B) ]. Heat denaturation analysis showed that the T m of HCoV-OC43 N protein is 52 C under our conditions. The thermal denaturation of HCo-OC43 N protein is reversible (data not shown).",

To evaluate whether electrostatic interactions stabilize the compact conformations of higher-order multimers, the oligomeric behaviors of N protein at different ionic strengths were studied. Briefly, the purified full-length N proteins, which were in a buffer containing sodium chloride, were cross-linked by 0.04% glutaraldehyde. In addition, we analyzed the oligomerization of N protein using analytical gel filtration chromatography [ Fig. 5(B) ].

Unlike SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E N proteins, the recombinant HCoV-OC43 N protein is highly resistant to proteolysis. 17 According to previous heat and urea denaturation analyses, the T m and C m values of SARS-CoV N protein are 38 C and 2.77 M, respectively, implying a low stability of the SARS-CoV N protein. 45 In this work, the T m and C m of the HCoV-OC43 N protein were found to be 52 C and 4 M, respectively. Our results suggest that the HCoV-OC43 N protein is more stable than the SARS-CoV N protein. 45 In this study, we have shown that the recombinant HCoV-OC43 N protein expressed in E. coli binds to the intergenic sequence of the RNA genomic leader. This binding demonstrates that the obtained recombinant N protein was properly folded. We examined the binding of recombinant HCoV-OC43 protein for nucleic acids. Our kinetic data showed that HCoV-OC43 N protein binds preferentially to single-stranded RNA over the corresponding single-stranded DNA. The decreased affinity for DNA may be due to two factors. First, the 2 0 -hydroxyl group of ribose in RNA may form hydrogen bonds with residues of the N protein. Second, in DNA, the methyl group on the C5 of thymine may create a steric clash with residues within the RNA-binding groove. The Hiscox group suggested that phosphorylation of the N protein determined the recognition of virus RNA because phosphorylation may alter the conformation of N protein, and thus affect its RNA-binding sites. 12, 33, 34 In addition, Mohandas et al. have reported that dephosphorylation of MHV N protein by cellular phosphoprotein phosphatase may facilitate the infectious process. 46 However, the role of phosphorylation in the RNA-binding sites of HCoV-OC43 N protein was not investigated in our study because the N protein was expressed in E coli. It would be interesting to study the effects of phosphorylation on the conformation and RNA-binding properties of HCoV-OC43 N protein in the future.",

It has a U-shaped structure with the two arms rich in basic residues and the flexible loops well-ordered around the b-sheet core of the N-terminal domain. 26, 36 Spencer and Hiscox found that the N-terminal region of IBV protein facilitates long-range, nonspecific interactions between N protein and viral RNA, thus leading to the formation of the ribonucleocapsid via a lure and lock mechanism. 29 Similar to the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV and IBV N proteins, the N-terminal domain of HCoV-OC43 N protein contains many positively charged residues and has been shown by SPR to be responsible for RNA binding. In addition to the Nterminal domain (N1-173), two highly positively charged portions of the central linker region, N174-232 and N233-300, also show RNA-binding activity. Given their high pI values, these RNA-binding regions may rely on electrostatic interactions to interact with RNA. Compared with N1-173 and N233-300, N174-232 has lower RNA-binding affinity and, therefore, appears to play an auxiliary role in RNA binding, despite the presence of a serine/arginine motif (SR-rich motif) that is usually involved in RNA recognition. 48 In a previous study, the SR-rich motif of MHV N protein was shown to be the RNA-binding region. 28, 42 In addition, the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein has been proposed to bind nucleic acids and to participate in genomic RNA-binding. 25, 49 However, our studies suggest that the C-terminal domain (N301-448) of the HCoV-OC43 N protein does not bind RNA.",

These oligomers exist predominantly as dimers. 44, 50 The N-terminal domain allows for the association of dimers to form higherorder oligomers. Crystal structures of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV and IBV N proteins show a similar general polypeptide fold, which strongly suggests that the dimerized N protein is the functional unit in vivo for the four groups of coronaviruses. 27, 35 The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain shows a tightly intertwined, twofold symmetric C-terminal domain dimer with a b-hairpin (b1 and b2) from one subunit extending into the cavity of the opposite subunit; this forms an antiparallel b-sheet with hydrogen bonds across the dimer interface. Luo et al. 49 have reported that this dimer association does not involve electrostatic forces. These authors have further suggested that the SR-rich motif of the SARS-CoV N protein binds to the central region and thereby triggers the multimerization of dimers. 51 In addition, Fan et al. showed that the N-terminal region of the IBV N protein is involved in the oligomerization of N protein. 26 Here, we analyzed the self-association properties of the HCoV-OC43 N protein and found it to form oligomers. We identified the C-terminal 148 amino acids of HCoV-OC43 N protein to be the oligomerization domain. When expressed in isolation, this region of the C-terminus formed oligomers at only micromolar concentrations, and this oligomerization occurred in the absence of the N-terminal domain. The other truncated constructs of HCoV-OC43 N protein, N1-173 and N174-232, were found to remain as monomers under all of the tested experimental conditions, suggesting that these two regions are not involved in oligomerization during ribonucleocapsid formation.",

For example, HCoV-OC43 N protein is more highly ordered and stabler than the SARS-CoV protein previously studied. 17, 45 We also showed that HCoV-OC43 N protein is composed of three RNA-binding regions lying within the N-terminal region (residues 1-173) and central-linker region (residues 174-232 and 233-300) that bind to RNA in a cooperative manner. Although the C-terminal region (N301-448) lacks RNA-binding activity, this region plays an important role in the oligomerization of the HCoV-OC43 N protein. This study may benefit the development of drugs to disrupt the binding of viral N protein with RNA and viral assembly.",

To generate both fulllength and truncated forms of the recombinant N proteins, the N protein gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from plasmid pGENT using various primers. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the DNA fragments were cloned into pET28a (Novagen) using T4 ligase (NEB). Bacteria transformed with the resultant plasmid were grown in culture. Protein expression was induced by supplementing the culture medium with IPTG to 1 mM followed by incubation at 10 C for 24 h. After harvesting the bacteria by centrifugation (3500g, 30 min, 4 C), the bacterial pellets were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-buffered solution, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, and 15 mM imidazole). Soluble proteins were obtained from the supernatant following centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 C) to remove the precipitate. Full-length and truncated N proteins carrying a His6-tag at their N-termini were purified using a Ni-NTA column (Novagen) with an elution gradient ranging from 15 to 300 mM imidazole. The pure fractions were collected and dialyzed against low-salt buffer. Since the N protein is positively-charged, it was further purified by SP cation exchange chromatography using a gradient from 0.05M to 1.5M NaCl in 50 mM Tris at pH 7.3, 0.1% CHAPS. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method with Bio-Rad protein assay reagents.",

The photomultiplier absorbance did not exceed 600 V during the analysis. CD spectra were normalized by subtraction of the background scan with buffer alone. The mean residue ellipticity, [H], was calculated based on the equation, [H] \u00bc MRW\u00c2Hk/10\u00c2l\u00c2c, where MRW is the mean residue weight, Hk is the measured ellipticity in milidegrees at wavelength k, l is the cuvette pathlength (0.1 cm), and c is the protein concentration in g/mL. The results were analyzed using the SELCON3 program to calculate the percentage of each type of secondary structure. 52 In addition, T m was determined from the polynomial fitting of the observed curve and taken as the temperature corresponding to half denaturation of the N protein. The first derivative of absorption with respect to temperature, dA/dT, of the melting curve was computer-generated and used for determining the T m .",

These changes, recorded in resonance units (RU), are generally assumed to be proportional to the mass of the molecules bound to the chip. The surface was first washed three times by injecting 10 lL of 100 mM NaCl solution with 50 mM NaOH. To control the amount of RNA (or DNA) bound to the SA chip surface, the biotinylated oligomer was immobilized manually onto the surface of a streptavidin chip until a signal of 1200 RU was achieved in the first cell. The chip surface was then washed with 10 lL of 10 mM HCl to eliminate non-specific binding. The second flow cell was unmodified and served as a control. The appropriate N proteins were dissolved in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.3) with 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% CHAPS, and passed over the chip surface for 140 s at a flow rate of 30 lL/min to reach equilibrium. Blank buffer solution was then passed over the chip to initiate the dissociation reaction; this step was continued for an additional 600 s to complete the reaction. After 600 s, the surface was recovered by washing with 10 lL of 0.1% SDS for each single-stranded RNA (or DNA). Before fitting to the 1:1 Langmuir model, binding data were corrected by subtraction of the control to account for simple refractive index differences. Sensorgrams for interactions between RNA (or DNA) and protein were analyzed using BIA evaluation software (version 3). To verify if mass transport effects may arise during the interaction between N protein and immobilized RNA, binding experiments were performed at different flow rates and different surface binding capacity. It was found that the binding interaction between N protein and RNA is not a mass transport-limited process because the derived kinetic parameters (especially the association rate constant, k a ) are independent of the flow rate and binding capacity.",
