            "text": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a prevalent worldwide human pathogen that infects epithelial cells before it establishes latency in trigeminal or sacral nerve root ganglia (Steiner and Benninger, 2013), causing mucocutaneous lesions, keratitis, and encephalitis (Dropulic and Cohen, 2012). There are two serotypes of HSV, HSV-1 and HSV-2, also known as human herpesvirus 1 and 2 (HHV-1 and HHV-2). The most common clinical sign of HSV-1 is herpes labialis, as well as ocular diseases, including conjunctivitis and keratitis (Everett, 2014). HSV-2 is the main cause of recurrent genital herpes, which is one of the most predominant sexually transmitted diseases, and HSV-2 infection of newborns during delivery is usually accompanied by a high mortality rate (Cleary et al., 2005, Domeika et al., 2010, Overall, 1994). Moreover, epidemiological and biological studies have revealed that HSV-2 dramatically increases the risk of HIV infection (Barnabas and Celum, 2012, Freeman et al., 2006, Sartori et al., 2011) and may also act in conjunction with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection to increase the risk of invasive cervical carcinoma (Smith et al., 2002, Zhao et al., 2012). According to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, in 2012, there were 417 million people aged 15\u201349 years living with HSV-2 infection worldwide (Looker et al., 2015), and the newly infected population is estimated to be 23 million per year (Looker et al., 2008). Therefore, the development of vaccines and novel therapeutic strategies against HSV has become very urgent.",

            "text": "Both initial entry of the virion into cells and subsequent lateral spread of HSV require the interaction of four viral glycoproteins, gB, gD, gH and gL, with at least one of the cell receptors, either herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) or nectin-1. Among these viral glycoproteins, gD acts as the receptor-binding glycoprotein, and gH, gL and gB are required for membrane fusion execution. The gD ectodomain is organized into two structurally and functionally differentiated regions. The N terminus (residues 1\u2013260) carries the receptor binding sites, and the C terminus functions as the pro-fusion domain (residues 260\u2013310), which is required for triggering virus-cell fusion. In nature, the C terminus of the gD ectodomain binds to its N-terminal region and masks the receptor-binding site, resulting in a closed conformation (Cocchi et al., 2004, Fusco et al., 2005). After binding to a cell surface receptor, either HVEM or nectin-1, gD undergoes conformational changes to adopt an open conformation, which is a key step in activating the core fusion machinery of gH/gL and gB. gD is the most abundantly expressed glycoprotein on the virion, and it induces both humoral and cellular immunity and is the major stimulus of virus-neutralizing antibodies together with gB (Bender et al., 2007, Eisenberg et al., 2012, Fotouhi et al., 2008, Nicola et al., 1998, Whitbeck et al., 1999). Therefore, gD has been the predominant candidate for HSV vaccine or novel therapeutic strategies (Awasthi and Friedman, 2014, Shin and Iwasaki, 2013).",

The protein was purified under denaturing conditions in the presence of 8M urea by using a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) column and then dialyzed (Pirestani et al., 2014). The quantity of purified protein was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). BALB/c mice (n = 2) were immunized with 60 \u03bcg of purified gD1-318t in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). After 2, 4, and 6 weeks, the immunizations was repeated with gD1-318t conjugate in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). Fusion with SP2/0 myeloma cells was carried out by using standard methodology (de StGroth and Scheidegger, 1980). Hybridomas culture supernatant was screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis. Totally 25 strains of positive hybridoma cells were obtained.

Not all neutralizing mAbs can prevent cell-to-cell spread of herpesviruses (Co et al., 1991, Hooks et al., 1976). Therefore, blocking of cell-to-cell spread is considered to be an important aspect in evaluating the in vivo protective efficiency of neutralizing antibodies. We herein analyzed the ability of m27f to inhibit cell-to-cell spread of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in vitro. Confluent BHK cell monolayers were initially incubated with either HSV-1 or HSV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 pfu per cell. To prevent viral spread through viral particles moving across the cell culture supernatant (cell-free spread), BHK cell monolayers were treated with an excess of m27f or 21C11, and treatment with mouse IgG or culture medium alone was performed as controls. After 48 h p.i., the transmission of virus was detected by immunostaining with mouse polyclonal antibody against gD. As shown in Fig. 4\nA, m27f completely inhibited cell-to-cell spread of both HSV-1 and HSV-2, as evidenced by observing the limited fluorescence caused by virus infection. In contrast, neither 21C11 nor mouse IgG could sufficiently inhibit transmission of HSV-1 or HSV-2, and extensive virus spread on BHK cell monolayer was observed by immunostaining. When the infected cells were quantified, the results clearly showed that m27f is able to inhibit cell-to-cell transmission in HSV-infected cells (Fig. 4B).",

We compared the neutralization efficacy of m27f when the antibody was added before (pre-attachment) or after (post-attachment) HSV virions interacted with Vero cells. 21C11 was chosen as a negative control. By pre- or post-attachment assays, when m27f was added before virus-host interaction (pre-attachment), about 60% HSV-1 infection was inhibited at a concentration of 120 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 5\nA), about 65% HSV-1 infection was inhibited at a concentration of 120 \u03bcg/ml when m27f was added after HSV-1 virions interacted with Vero cells (post-attachment) (Fig. 5B). Almost equal neutralization efficacy of m27f was observed, irrespective of whether the antibody was added before or after HSV-1 virions interacted with Vero cells. In contrast, the negative control, 21C11, had no neutralizing ability either before or after virions were incubated with cells. The HSV-2 infection group showed a similar result. About 80% HSV-2 infection was inhibited in the pre-attachment treatment (Fig. 5C) and about 90% HSV-2 infection was inhibited in the post-attachment treatment with an antibody concentration of 120 \u03bcg/ml of m27f (Fig. 5D). In contrast, 21C11 had low (20% HSV-2 infection being inhibited) or no neutralizing ability in the pre-attachment or post-attachment treatments, respectively (Fig. 5C and D). The existing data indicated that m27f does not interfere with the virus binding process, m27f therefore neutralizes HSV entry at the post-binding stage.",

Monolayers of Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2 at an MOI of 5 pfu per cell. After 2 h of adsorption at 37 \u00b0C, the virus inoculum was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS, the cells were then incubated with an excess of m27f, 21C11, mouse IgG, or medium alone as a control. After 48 h, syncytium formation was observed by staining with HE staining. As shown in Fig. 6\nA, in both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection groups, obvious syncytia with multi-nuclear cells were observed when infected cells were treated with pre-immune serum, mouse IgG or 21C11. However, when cells were incubated with m27f, syncytium formation was almost completely inhibited. The syncytium formation inhibition of Vero cells with different treatment was quantified in Fig. 6B. This result suggested that m27f indeed inhibited the HSV-induced membrane fusion.",

The experimental groups of BALB/c mice were treated intravenously with 1, 3, 7, or 15 mg/kg of antibody at 24, 48 and 72 h after intravaginal HSV-2 challenge. As shown in Fig. 7, mice receiving 1 mg/kg of m27f were slightly protected against lethal infection by HSV-2, the body weight of this group decreased as fast as the PBS-treated group, with a median survival time of 2 days longer than those of control mice treated with PBS. However, Mice treated with 3 mg/kg or higher concentrations of m27f were completely protected from lethal HSV-2 infection (Fig. 7C).

For both vaccine design and novel therapeutic strategies, it is important to study epitopes on gD that stimulate virus-neutralizing antibodies. According to the properties of a panel of mAbs to gD and gD mutants, which were used to define the relationship between gD structure and function, anti-gD mAbs have been previously arranged into groups that recognize distinct discontinuous native and continuous denatured epitopes. Most mAbs that recognize discontinuous native epitopes have virus-neutralizing activity. For example, MC23 (which recognizes residues 213 and 216), DL11 (which recognizes residues 132 and 140), MC5 (which recognizes residues 75\u201379) and MC2 (which recognizes residue 246) have been reported previously to be neutralizing mAbs that recognize discontinuous conformational epitopes. (Krummenacher et al., 1998, Lazear et al., 2012, Muggeridge et al., 1990, Nicola et al., 1998, Whitbeck et al., 1999). There are also a number of reported mAbs that recognize continuous denatured epitopes of HSV gD. Among these mAbs, most have no or low virus-neutralizing ability, except for the mAb 1D3 (which recognizes residues 10 to 20), which can neutralize viral infectivity by blocking gD-receptor interaction (Cairns et al., 2014). In this study, we found a novel mAb, m27f, to be another virus-neutralizing mAb whose epitope is located within a continuous antigenic determinant.",

Sequences alignment analysis showed that this epitope is highly conserved among a broad range of type-1 and type-2 HSV strains (data not shown).

Co et al. humanized two murine monoclonal antibodies against HSV gB and gD, which had been shown to neutralizing HSV-1 in vitro, however, neither humanized and murine anti-gD mAb was able to protect against viral spread. While humanized and murine anti-gB mAb protected cells from viral spread (Co et al., 1991). Our research showed that m27f is able to inhibit cell-to-cell spread of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in vitro (Fig. 4), which is an efficient way for HSV to bypass the host immune system through the direct transmission adjacent cells.

            "text": "Antibodies against entry glycoproteins have the ability to neutralize virions via interfering with receptor binding or subsequent fusion events. For example, antibodies targeting both stalk (S2) and globular (S1) subunits of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus were able to abolish the binding between S protein and its cellular receptors. MAbs neutralize HIV by inhibiting the binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor (Wibmer et al., 2015, Zeng et al., 2006). The above-mentioned neutralizing mAbs MC23 and DL11 neutralize virus by blocking binding of gD to both receptors, HVEM and nectin-1. In addition, there are many reports of mAbs blocking virus entry at the post-receptor-binding step. For instance, neutralizing mAbs specific for the C-terminal domain of the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) surface (SU) envelope protein subunit interfere with a post-attachment event necessary for membrane fusion (Burkhart et al., 2003). MAb 44D11 against the F2 subunit of the Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus F protein neutralizes virus entry by inhibiting membrane fusion (Zou et al., 2016). Our data from pre-attachment and post-attachment neutralization assays indicated that m27f does not interfere with the virus binding process; instead, it might neutralize HSV entry at the post-binding stage (Fig. 5). By observing HSV-induced membrane fusion following treatment with m27f, we determined that m27f could almost completely inhibit syncytium formation (Fig. 6), which further confirms that m27f could inhibit the membrane fusion event rather than the virus binding process. Consistent with current findings, earlier studies (Cocchi et al., 2004, Fusco et al., 2005) established that the pro-fusion domain (residues 260\u2013310) is required for viral infectivity and fusion but not for receptor binding and the substitutions of some Pro residues in PFD (amino acids 288, 289, 291, and 292) affected steps in entry and fusion. However, the detailed mechanism of how m27f inhibits the HSV fusion process needs further study.",

Our data demonstrated that mAb m27f conferred protection in a dose-dependent manner and that 3 mg/kg or more of m27f provided full protection (Fig. 7). Consistently, intracutaneously injection human recombinant neutralizing mAb HSV8 specific for gD (type-common and its epitope located in residues 234 to 275) can protect mice effectively when administered systemically (Sanna et al., 1996, Zeitlin et al., 1996). Passive immunization of immunocompetent animals with gD specific mAb HD1 (a type-common neutralizing mAb, and its discontinuous epitope located in residues 1 to 234) postexposure at appropriate times demonstrated protection against 3 HSV-1 strains (HTZ, MP, and a mutant strain mP) and 1 HSV-2 strain G -induced neurological disease (Dix et al., 1981, Pereira et al., 1980). Furthermore, intravaginally administered murine anti-gB mAb post HSV-1 infection conferred full protection in an immunodeficient non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model (Krawczyk et al., 2011). These results encourage further potency of neutralizing mAbs for clinical therapy against severe HSV diseases.",
