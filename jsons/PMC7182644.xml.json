The risk of developing a first episode of common cold with fever, otitis or wheezy bronchitis in the early months following admission to a DCC is significantly higher in these infants than in children who stay at home [1]. Other recent surveys implemented in Pennsylvania [2, 3] and Georgia [4, 5] also demonstrated that the risk of respiratory illnesses associated with DCC attendance was significantly higher for the youngest children. The main risk factor is age, this being related to the disappearance of the protecting maternal antibodies within 3-4 months after birth rendering the infants susceptible to new infectious agents and leaving them with a still immature immune system.",
