Her panel reactive antibody (PRA) levels were found to be low at 4% as measured by flow cytometry using HLA class I Luminex-coated beads. The patient (CMV positive) finally underwent a CMV negative, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive orthotopic heart transplant without the need for desensitization. The patient's immediate postoperative course was complicated by multiple failed attempts at extubation secondary to fluid overload that required tracheostomy and acute kidney injury requiring temporary hemodialysis (with complete eventual recovery of renal function). The patient after 4 weeks, on routine surveillance endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), was found to have ISHLT grade 2R acute cellular rejection which was successfully treated with intravenous pulsed steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient was eventually discharged home 2 weeks later and was followed as an outpatient. Three months subsequent to transplant the patient started to develop signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections manifesting as unremitting cough. The patient admitted was found to have viral infection with positive serologies for entero, rhino, and coronaviruses, and the EMB was negative for rejection. The patient was managed conservatively without any antiviral treatment except prophylactic ganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis and discharged home. The patient did present again with similar respiratory symptoms a month later at which time it was decided to treat the patient with a course of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for a clinical suspicion of influenza. The patient was discharged only to be readmitted 2 months later (6 months after transplant) for symptoms of exertional dyspnea, nausea, and abdominal pain. The patient was found to have low cardiac index (1.59 L/min/m2) and elevated right sided pressures on right heart catheterization while the EMB remained negative for cellular or humoral rejection. An echocardiogram at the time revealed a mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction at 40% with mild right ventricular dysfunction. The patient's panel reactive antibodies were undetectable.  Table 1 lists the trends in the available viral titres and other laboratory data (glucose and lipids). The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis to treat for possible graft dysfunction. The next day the patient had a sudden cardiorespiratory arrest and died despite prolonged attempts at resuscitation.",

            "text": "CMV is one of the pathogens that has been most convincingly implicated in the pathophysiology of CAV [5]. Viral infections including those due to CMV have been associated with accelerated CAV [6, 7]. Positive pretransplantation CMV serology has been shown to be a risk factor for CAV in children [8, 9]. Cardiovascular risk has also been associated with seropositivity for Chlamydia pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, CMV, and other herpes viruses. However, more recent studies in larger patient cohorts have demonstrated only modest associations [10, 11]. Given the modest and variable risk that has been linked to individual pathogens, Zhu and colleagues have proposed the sum of the relevant infectious agents, defined as the \u201ctotal pathogen burden,\u201d as the important risk factor to be considered. Exposure to a panel of five pathogens was found to be predictive of angiographic disease [12] and cardiovascular events [13]. Similar results were reported in a study showing that exposure to increasing number of pathogens was associated with increased risk [14]. An increasing \u201cpathogen burden\u201d defined as the aggregate number of positive serologies (mainly driven by burden of Herpesviridae) was significantly predictive of the long-term prognosis in a doseresponse manner. These observations have led the investigators to propose the \u201cHerpes Burden\u201d (aggregate seropositivity to CMV, herpes simplex-1 and -2, and EBV) as a more effective predictor of cardiovascular risk [14]. Our patient had a CMV positive status who received an EBV positive donor heart along with a history of documented herpes zoster infection in the past. Whether the multiple serologically positive viral infections (entero, rhino, and coronaviruses) amongst the many other nonimmune factors augmented the existent viral burden thereby triggering a self-perpetuating immune cascade, inducing inflammation and intimal proliferation, is a concept that can only be hypothesized and arduous to prove. Kumar et al. in their prospective study of 93 lung transplant recipients recently demonstrated acute rejection (\u2265grade 2 ISHLT) in 33.3% (16/48) patients within 3 months of respiratory viral infections (RVIs) as opposed to only 6.7% (3/45) in RVI negative patients. Sixty-two percent of these patients with history of RVIs progressed to obliterative bronchiolitis (chronic airway rejection) on biopsies done within 1 year [15]. This study adds to the increasing evidence highlighting a possible immunogenic potential of respiratory viruses in solid organ recipients manifesting as acute or chronic rejection.",
