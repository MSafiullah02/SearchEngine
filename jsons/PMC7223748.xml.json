Physicians must determine a neurological cause for the irreversible cessation of brain function and rule out confounders, as listed in Table 1. After determination of cause, two physicians perform a neurological exam, with careful evaluation of brain stem reflexes and response to stimulation. An apnea test is then performed, with the patient disconnected from mandated delivery of respirations from a ventilator, and the patient is closely monitored for respiratory efforts. Details of the reflex testing and the apnea test are described in Table 2. Depending on the age of the patient, the examination and apnea testing are repeated at set time periods. Ancillary tests, such as an electroencephalogram (EEG), digital subtraction cerebral angiogram, or radionuclide perfusion scintigraphy, are performed in patients unable to complete any part of the neurological examination or apnea testing. Death is declared once testing is completed.",

Despite the vast majority of respondents reporting competency in performing brain death testing, only 25% reported conducting the testing in accordance with current practice guidelines. Ten percent of the providers did not perform an apnea test, the omission of which would be an incomplete (and incorrect) performance of brain death examination. Even more problematic, of the providers that obtained ancillary tests on an as-needed basis, more than a quarter ordered them if the patient breathed during apnea testing, a finding inconsistent with brain death. These survey results are troubling and suggestive that misdiagnosis of brain death may be more common than previously assumed.",

When updating the 2010 AAN guidelines, Wijdicks et al. found no peer-reviewed journal reports of patients who had regained neurological recovery after proper application of the AAN parameters [13]. In the decade since, case reports have been described of patients declared brain dead, who on further examination were noted to have some type of neurological function of uncertain origin [21]. Careful review of these case reports reveals incomplete and variable documentation of the confirmatory tests performed. Uncertainty of the proper application of AAN brain death guidelines makes retrospective interpretation of these cases impossible [12]. In their 2019 position statement, the AAN reiterated that they were \u201cnot aware of any cases in which following these guidelines led to inaccurate determination of death with return of any brain function, including consciousness, brainstem reflexes, or breathing\u201d [12].",

She was pronounced brain dead after she lost brainstem reflexes and showed no spontaneous respiration on apnea test. Her father filed a motion for a restraining order against the hospital from discontinuing organ support; the district court ruled against the motion, stating that Hailu met the AAN guidelines for brain death and was thus legally dead. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Nevada, who declared that the hospital had improperly determined Hailu as brain dead per Nevada statutes and reversed the lower court decision, holding that the district court had failed properly to consider whether the AAN Guidelines adequately measured all functions of the entire brain including the brain stem, and questioned whether the AAN Guidelines were considered accepted medical standards by the medical community. In response, the Nevada state legislature amended their state UDDA to require the declaration of neurological death (DND) follow guidelines established by the American Academy of Neurology or the Pediatric Section of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, including future updates [31]. This represents the first time state laws have stipulated the specific medical guidelines to be used in brain death declaration.",

McMath was a 13-year-old who suffered anoxic brain injury from massive hemorrhage and cardiac arrest after a routine tonsillectomy at Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland. She was declared brain dead at the treating hospital on December 12, 2013. Her family petitioned to continue cardiopulmonary support, and ultimately the Alemeda County Superior Court ruled that she was legally dead. This decision was appealed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, with the eventual agreement that McMath\u2019s body with supportive equipment would be released to the custody of her mother. Her mother then transported McMath to a hospital in New Jersey, where she had a tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy placed. In January 2018, when liver and kidney failure developed, ventilator support was removed, and a second death certificate was issued in the state of New Jersey. Since the McMath case, several lawsuits have arisen where families have sued to have the patient moved to New Jersey or other countries, such as Guatemala, where brain death criteria are not as strictly observed [39\u201342].",

In 2017, Yechezkel Nazar was admitted with a severe intracranial hemorrhage. Neurologic exam and CT findings were suggestive of brain death and accordingly, his physicians performed a neurological exam and apnea test on a holy day when the family was not able to be present. He was declared dead despite the expressed opposition of his family. His wife petitioned the court for nullification of the death certificate in order for medical insurance coverage to continue during the 3 weeks he remained on cardiopulmonary support before circulatory arrest. In early 2019, the death certificate was ruled null due to the hospital\u2019s lack of \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d by not delaying the declaration of death until the family\u2019s concerns had been addressed. The court mandated a reissuance of the death certificate with the date of his circulatory arrest [48]. It remains to be seen how this ruling may affect other requests for religious accommodation.",

Prolonged maternal somatic support requires exceedingly complex management of several medical conditions that arise with brain death, including hemodynamic instability, pituitary dysfunction, diabetes insipidus, neurogenic pulmonary edema, infection, and nutritional depletion. These complications and their management have an uncertain impact on fetal development [55, 56]. While most states have not enacted laws that specifically address the brain dead pregnant patient, over 30 states have statutes that deny the withdrawal or withholding life-sustaining treatment from pregnant patients or invalidate legal advanced directives during pregnancy. Some require the continuation of support dependent on fetal viability and likelihood of survival [54].

The incidence of severe neurologic injury in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is reported to be as high as 50% [60, 61], due to the inciting pathologies that led to initiating ECMO, the need for anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis in the ECMO circuit, and the coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia that develops as a result of platelet consumption due to the circuit [60]. Patients who require ECMO support may have significant cardiac or pulmonary disease burden and in these patients, apnea test may be too challenging to perform or they may be too hemodynamically unstable to transport to offsite locations for confirmatory testing [62\u201365].",

Several aspects of ECMO pose challenges with regard to brain death testing [62]. Oxygenation (O2) and removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) is achieved by a countercurrent exchange system between the patient\u2019s blood and sweep flow through the circuit oxygenator. As such, changes in the blood flow or the sweep flow will affect a patient\u2019s PaO2 and PaCO2. Although sweep rates can be decreased to the lowest setting to achieve the rise in PaCO2 necessary to trigger a respiratory response, it risks causing a decrease in patient oxygenation and concomitant hemodynamic instability [64, 65]. Some suggest adding CO2 via the ECMO blender to achieve a controlled rise in PaCO2 necessary to elicit respiratory response, which may have less hemodynamic effects [62, 63], but studies demonstrating the accuracy and effectiveness of these modifications are lacking.",

The existence of multiple guidelines and the need for repeated tests on what is supposed to be an objective phenomenon may contribute to the perception of inconsistency and public confusion. Poor understanding and misinformed exposure to the concept of brain death make communication with families of brain dead children difficult; physicians report that requests for ongoing organ support most often stem from the belief that the patient could regain neurologic function [9].

There is a need for uniformity in the definition and the objectivity in determining brain death, a need for consistency in the training and practice of carrying out brain death examination, and a need for invariability in the legal acceptance of the medical standard. In the face of continued advances in our technology and our ability to sustain cardiopulmonary function, cases of increasing complexity are expected to arise, and it is important to uphold the societal trust of our medical practice.",
