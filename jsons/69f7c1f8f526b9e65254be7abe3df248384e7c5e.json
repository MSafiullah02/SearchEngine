While both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have been shown to be involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via S protein activation, sera from convalescent SARS patients have been shown to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV2-S-mediated entry into a large number of sensitive cell lines [4] .",

Activation of TMPRSS2 further plays a key role in other viral respiratory diseases such as influenza A (as with MERS) and inhibition of viral activation by a serine protease inhibitor, the hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type-1 (HAI-1), has been demonstrated in vitro [6] .

            "text": "Based on our knowledge on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV entry into host cells, the therapeutic potential of TMPRSS2 inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 can be postulated (Supplemental Figure   1 ). While S1/S2 precleavage was shown to promote S protein activation, processing by TMPRSS2 appears to be critical for infection by these viruses [6] . The detailed mechanism of proteolytic activation of these viruses by TMPRSS2 both at entry and release phases of the infection cycle has been reviewed [1]. Further research is however required to better appreciate the extent by which the proteases and endosomal pathway are involved in viral entry for SARS-CoV-2. The preference of wild-type human coronavirus for cell surface TMPRSS2 when compared to the endosomal route has already been shown [7] . The FDAapproved expectorant/mucolytic agent and cough suppressant, bromhexine hydrochloride, is a well-known potent inhibitor of TMPRSS2 with IC50 equal to 0.75 \u03bcM [1]. Since epithelisin is expressed primarily in the apical surface of airway epithelial cells, inhibiting pulmonary TMPRSS2 with bromhexine hydrochloride could represent a prophylactic strategy against the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV2. Because there is no substantial adverse effect, it is reasonable to suggest that this well-known TMPRSS2 inhibitor cold be regarded as a novel prophylactic agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection and research on other potential inhibitors should be encouraged. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate its prophylactic potential against SARS-CoV-2.",

The entry of coronavirus into host cells requires proteolytic activation by protease enzymes and several potential targets have already been identified. New evidence suggests that TMPRSS2 is involved in MERS and SARS-CoV S protein processing for infection in a number of susceptible host cells in cell lines obtained from various organs [1]. In the murine models of infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, for example, TMPRSS2-knockout mice exhibit lower level of viral spread in the lungs coupled with reduced severity in immunopathology [2].",
