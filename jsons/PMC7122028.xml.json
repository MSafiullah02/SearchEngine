            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common inherited disorder affecting a variety of epithelial tissues. The disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) that lead to abnormal secretions, recurrent infection and inflammation, bronchiectasis, and premature death. Because airways disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis, gene therapy efforts have focused on luminal delivery of vector to the airways of CF patients. Retroviruses are attractive as a gene transfer vector system since integration of the wild-type CFTR cDNA into the host genome may lead to long-term expression and perhaps, a cure. However, simple retroviruses are limited as vectors for airway gene transfer by the low rates of epithelial cell proliferation in human airways (\u223c0.1\u20130.2%) combined with the traditionally low titers. Advances in vector design and production have improved titers, and the development of human and animal lentiviruses may help overcome the requirement for cell proliferation. These developments have raised hopes for retroviral approaches for treatment of CF lung disease.",

To evaluate the polarity of lentiviral transduction, vescicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-G (VSV-G) pseudotyped vectors have been applied to either the apical or the basolateral surfaces of polarized well-differentiated (WD) human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. Thirty-fold greater transduction efficiency was observed in vitro when HIV VSV-G vectors were applied to the basolateral surface as compared to apical application of vector (11). Goldman and colleagues demonstrated that luminally applied HIV (VSV-G) vectors failed to transduce WD primary HAE cells in bronchial xenografts (11). Similar data have evolved for EIAV pseudotyped with VSV-G (11a), and for amphotropicand VSV-G-enveloped FIV vectors (7,10). These data suggest that, while lentiviral vectors can transduce nondividing cells, the receptors for uptake and entry of amphotropic and VSV-G pseudotyped MLV and lentiviral vectors are predominantly localized to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells.",

Johnson et al. exposed mice to sulfur dioxide (SO2) inhalation to increase vector delivery to the basolateral surface and/or basal cells of murine tracheas. Induction of airway cell proliferation peaked at 24 h postinhalation with no significant increase in proliferation occurring in the first 12 h after inhalation (12). SO2 also caused a dose-related denuding of the surface epithelium leaving the basal cell layer intact. In regions less severely injured by SO2, permeability was increased through the tight junctions (12). Using this model, mice were exposed to SO2 for 3 h at 500 ppm, and a HIV (VSV-G) vector was delivered onto the nasal or tracheal epithelia of rodents (8). Efficient reporter gene transfer was observed in nasal and tracheal airway epithelia, whereas no gene transfer was detected in the nasal or tracheal airway epithelia of sham (air)-exposed controls (8,12). Gene transfer to murine trachea was also more efficient following SO2 exposure when vector was administered on the same day of exposure (\u223c7% of cells transduced) and when cell proliferation was not increased, as compared to the day after SO2 inhalation (2% transduction of cells) at which time peak airway cell proliferation occurs. This finding is consistent with preferential transduction of nondividing cells (8). These data demonstrate that HIV vectors can efficiently transduce airway epithelia in vivo when access to receptors on the basolateral membrane is increased by injury.",

Nonprimate lentiviral vectors have been coadministered with calcium chelators to airways to increase vector access to basolateral receptors, presumably by modulating paracellular permeability (7,10). Wang et al. applied FIV-CFTR vectors in combination with hypotonic solution and ethylene glycol-bis[\u03b2-aminoethyl ether]-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) to the apical membrane of polarized WD CF airway epithelial cells (7,10). Restoration of chloride secretory function was achieved following infection with FIV-CFTR in primary CF airway epithelial cells that was similar to levels of correction achieved with an adenoviral (Ad)CFTR vector. The correction of chloride secretory function mediated by FIV-CFTR persisted for up to six months in culture, whereas the AdCFTR-mediated Cl- correction had resolved by 21 d after transduction. Subsequently, these investigators demonstrated relatively efficient transduction of ciliated and nonciliated cells within rabbit airways in vivo comprising approx 5% of airway cells infected with vector at d 5 and decreasing to approx 2.5% of cells at 6 wk (7). The mechanism of attenuation of transgene expression was not evaluated. Nevertheless, FIV-CFTR vectors offer promise as vectors for gene therapy of cystic fibrosis.",

Olsen demonstrated efficient transduction of WD primary HAE cells after apical application of EIAV (VSV-G) \u03b2-galactosidase (lacZ) vector in the presence of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) or EGTA to increase access to basolateral receptors by permeabilizing the tight junction. Persistence of transgene expression in vitro lasted for up to 24 d posttransduction, the longest period tested. In preliminary studies, EIAV vectors with internal promoters have been shown to express reporter genes in murine tracheal airway epithelia following SO2 injury to increase delivery to basal cells and the basolateral membrane (13). The efficiency of transduction was dose-related with minimal transduction at vector titers of 108 infectious units (i.u.)/mL, whereas vectors with approx 1010 i.u./mL yielded transduction efficiencies that were significantly greater than those observed at lower EIAV lentiviral titers (13).",

Toward this goal, investigators have screened enveloped viruses for their ability to infect WD HAE cells from the apical surface. Although some efforts have focused on common respiratory viruses, others have also included nonrespiratory viruses. Of the respiratory viruses considered as candidates for pseudotyping, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human corona virus, and influenza virus have received the most attention. Wild-type and replication-competent recombinant RSV have been shown to infect or enter cells across the apical membrane of WD HAE cells (14,15). Human corona virus 229E (HcoV229E) has also been shown to bind and enter across the apical membrane of WD HAE cells (16).

Filoviridae are enveloped, nonsegmented negative sense RNA viruses, which include Ebola virus and Marburg virus among its members. To identify viral envelopes capable of mediating apical transduction of polarized air-liquid interface cultures, HIV vectors were pseudotyped with murine leukemia virus (MLV), influenza-hemagglutinin, RSV F and G proteins, Mokola, Ebola Reston (Ebo-R), or Ebola Zaire (EboZ) envelopes. Concentrated stocks of EboZ, but not EboR or other pseudotypes, efficiently transduced polarized HAE cells following apical application with gene transfer in up to 70% of cells as compared to up to 40% of cells following basolateral transduction. EboZ-pseudotyped HIV vectors also transduced WD HAE cells in xenografts and in freshly excised human tracheal explants. Thus, lentiviral vectors may overcome the limitations of low rates of cellular proliferation, and pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with specific envelope proteins may overcome barriers to titer and the lack of apical membrane receptors on polarized WD HAE cells.",

            "text": "\nBiG-45 cells are maintained on tissue culture plates coated with poly-l-lysine (PLL) to improve adherence of cells to the plate. PLL coating solution is made up by adding 16 mL of tissue culture grade poly-l-lysine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to 500 mL tissue culture grade H2O. To coat 10-cm tissue culture plates, 6 mL of PLL coating solution is added to the plate and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The PLL solution is removed, and the remaining PLL is allowed to collect near one edge by raising one side of the plate. After removing the solution with a Pasteur pipet, the plates are allowed to dry completely in a tissue culture hood for several hours.It is prudent to make up several HEPES stocks from pH 7.05 to pH 7.2, and test them functionally.Collagen-coated plastic tissue culture dishes are prepared as follows. Dilute sterile concentrated purified collagen 1\u223675 in sterile H2O. Apply 0.5 mL/well to 12-well culture plate, 1.0 mL/well to 6-well culture plate, or 4 mL/well to 10-cm plate. Incubate from 2 h to overnight at 37\u00b0C. Remove collagen by aspiration and air dry in tissue culture hood. UV sterilize under tissue culture hood for 10\u201315 min. Seal plates with parafilm and store at 4\u00b0C for up to 6 wk.We prepare our own BPE stocks. However, BPE can also be purchased commercially (Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Thaw mature unprocessed bovine pituitaries (Pel Freeze, Rogers, AZ) at 4\u00b0C. Drain blood and rinse pituitaries with chilled PBS. Add 200 g of tissue to 400 mL cold PBS and mince in Hamilton-Beach (Washington, NC) Blendmaster-7-speed blender for 10 min. Transfer blended solution into 500 mL Beckman centrifuge canisters (Beckman JA-10 Rotor) and centrifuge at 5000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Combine supernatants and aliquot. Before use, respin aliquot at 5000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and pass supernatant through a 0.4-\u03bcm filter.We prepare our own growth medium (23,24), but a similar commercial product is available (BEGM, Clonetics, San Diego, CA). For culture of airway epithelial cells from the lungs or cystic fibrosis subjects, additional antibiotics are required (24).For 293T cells, as with BiG-45 cells, higher vector yields are obtained if poly-l-lysine-coated plates are used for transfection. We attribute this to better adherence of the cells to the plate during medium changing.The use of human tissues generally requires approval from your local institutional review board (IRB) for the protection of human subjects. Although some uses may be exempt from review, we recommend that all investigators submit a protocol for review. An exemption, if appropriate, will be granted by the IRB.Epithelial cell yield is greater after 48 h of protease digestion than after 24 h, without significant loss of viability. By 72 h of protease digestion, cell viability has decreased significantly.Other commercially available permeable substrates can be used for culture of polarized HAE cells including Millipore filters (Bedford, MA) and Transwell-Clear (Corning Costar).The EVOM electrodes should be sterilized before use by soaking in 70% ethanol and equilibrated in ALI medium prior to use. All measurements should be made in a tissue culture hood at room temperature. Measure the resistance across a blank T-Col and record. Subtract the blank resistance from measured resistance across HAE cells on a T-cols and multiply by the surface area to generate the actual Rt. When the culture has fully differentiated into an epithelial sheet with tight junctions, polarized HAE cells will have a Rt of 200 to 1200 Ohms-cm2. Typically p0 and p1 cells have a higher resistance than p2 cells.Some investigators apply a hypotonic Ca2+-free solution (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) containing EGTA or EDTA to the luminal bath.Bilateral application of EGTA or EDTA leads to a rapid fall in resistance (within minutes). However, epithelium may lift off from the substrate if chelators are left on the basolateral surface too long.\n",
