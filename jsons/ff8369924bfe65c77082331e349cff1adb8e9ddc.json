            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most significant production problem for the feedlot indus try, accounting for the majority of morbidity, mortal ity, and decreased production in feedlots with esti mated annual economic losses in excess of $2 billion (Powell, 2013) . The standard protocol when treating ABSTRACT: Ancillary therapy (ANC) is commonly provided in conjunction with an antimicrobial when treating calves for suspected bovine respiratory dis ease (BRD) in an attempt to improve the response to a suspected BRD challenge. The first experiment evaluated the effects of 3 ANC in combination with an antimicrobial in high-risk calves treated for BRD during a 56d receiving period. Newly received cross bred steers (n = 516; initial BW = 217 \u00b1 20 kg) were monitored by trained personnel for clinical signs of BRD. Calves that met antimicrobial treatment criteria (n = 320) were then randomly assigned to experi mental ANC treatment (80 steers/experimental ANC treatment): intravenous flunixin meglumine injection (NSAID), intranasal viral vaccination (VACC), intra muscular vitamin C injection (VITC), or no ANC (NOAC). Animal served as the experimental unit for all variables except DMI and G:F (pen served as the experimental unit for DMI and G:F). Within calves treated 3 times for BRD, those receiving NOAC had lower (P < 0.01) clinical severity scores (severity scores ranged from 0 to 4 on the basis of observed clini cal signs and severity) and heavier (P = 0.01) BW than those receiving NSAID, VACC, or VITC at the time of third treatment. Between the second and third BRD treatments, calves receiving NOAC had decreased (P < 0.01) daily BW loss (\u22120.13 kg ADG) compared with those receiving NSAID, VACC, or VITC (\u22121.30, \u22121.90, and \u22121.41 kg ADG, respectively). There were no differences in rectal temperature, combined mortal ities and removals, or overall performance among the experimental ANC treatments. Overall, morbidity and mortality attributed to BRD across treatments were 66.5% and 13.2%, respectively. After the receiving period, a subset of calves (n = 126) were allocated to finishing pens to evaluate the effects ANC administra tion on finishing performance, carcass characteristics, and lung scores at harvest. Ultrasound estimates, BW, and visual appraisal were used to target a common physiological end point for each pen of calves. There were no differences among the experimental ANC observed during the finishing period (P \u2265 0.11). In summary, the use of NSAID, VACC, and VITC do not appear to positively impact clinical health and could potentially be detrimental to performance during the receiving period in high-risk calves receiving antimi crobial treatment for suspected BRD. for suspected BRD in feedlot cattle is to administer an injectable antimicrobial. However, it is also common for veterinarians to prescribe an additional treatment, or ancillary therapy (ANC), along with the antimicro bial. The goal of ANC is to improve the response to a BRD challenge in calves treated with antimicrobi als, not to replace antimicrobial treatment. This can be accomplished by relieving the harmful effects of inflammation, blocking histamine activity, or boosting immune system function to aid in the defense against infectious pathogens (Apley, 1994) .",

Terrell et al. (2011) reported that 48% of vet erinarians recommended some form of ANC for the treatment of BRD. Recently, NAHMS (2013) released an updated survey detailing additional ANC use in feedlots. The most common forms of ANC listed in the surveys included antihistamines, B vitamins, cor ticosteroids, directfed microbials, nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAID), viral vaccines, and vi tamin C (NAHMS, 2001; Terrell et al., 2011; NAHMS, 2013) . Although these surveys provide evidence as to the scope of ANC use, there is limited published re search on the efficacy of these ANC. Hence, the objec tive of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of 3 of the most common ANC used in combination with an antimicrobial on the performance, health, and im mune response variables of newly received high-risk calves treated for clinical BRD.",

A recent re view of the research concerning ANC conducted by Apley (2010) chose to focus on the published data concerning the use of anti-inflammatory drugs as an ANC for BRD. In this review, multiple studies that demonstrated some beneficial effect of NSAID as an ANC are cited, with the most typical response ob served being a decrease in rectal temperature in calves treated with an NSAID. Apley (2010) determined that other clinical responses to NSAID as an ANC in the research were inconsistent. Francoz et al. (2012) also conducted a comprehen sive review of the literature concerning ANC use. For an experiment to be included in the review, the authors determined that the experiment must have involved the antimicrobial treatment of naturally occurring BRD and must have included experimental ANC treatments with and without at least 1 ANC. As a result of these criteria, experimental models, BRD prevention studies, studies evaluating an ANC without a control group, or studies including different antimicrobials within the treatment groups were not included. When studies not meeting these stipulations were removed from consid eration, only 15 articles met the criteria. Of those 15 experiments, 14 dealt with anti-inflammatory drugs (12 NSAID experiments, 1 steroidal anti-inflammatory drug experiment, and 1 experiment containing both a steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and NSAID), and 1 dealt with immune modulators (Francoz et al., 2012) . Upon reviewing the data related to the use of NSAID as an ANC to BRD, Francoz et al. (2012) concluded that NSAID caused a more rapid decrease in rectal temper ature of calves but did not in any way benefit clinical signs, mortality, or calf performance. The authors did mention that published data were lacking and too in consistent to conclusively determine the effects on calf performance or mortality when NSAID were used as an ANC for BRD. Francoz et al. (2012) also suggested that NSAID have the potential to decrease lung lesions at slaughter but noted that lung consolidation was only evaluated in 2 of the studies. On the basis of the results of this review, it could be argued that the decrease in rectal temperature and the potential decrease in lung lesions at slaughter resulting from NSAID administra tion may be important from an animal welfare perspec tive. However, it would be extremely difficult to justify the economics of NSAID use based on inconsistent improvements in clinical signs and the lack of perfor mance benefits seen in calves receiving an NSAID as ANC for BRD (Francoz et al., 2012) .",

Granted, rectal temperature was measured only in calves that met treatment criteria at the time of BRD treatment. It is quite possible that calves receiving NSAID could have demonstrated decreased rectal temperatures if rectal temperature was obtained a few hours after NSAID administration. This experiment attempted to mimic commercial production settings as much as possible, and pulling multiple calves up at short intervals to ob tain hourly rectal temperatures was not a priority of the current experiment. That is not to say that changes in rectal temperature were unimportant in the current ex periment, but rather, the concern was with prolonged or sustained changes in rectal temperature over the course of time. It should also be noted, however, that the in terval between BRD treatments was relatively short for many calves, and this was especially the case with the first and second BRD treatments. As such, if calves re ceiving NSAID demonstrated any prolonged improve ment in rectal temperatures it could have been detected, and that was not the case. It has also been suggested in the research that NSAID have the potential to de crease lung lesions at harvest in treated calves. Our data did not support these findings. In the present ex periment, the administration of NSAID as an ANC did not decrease lung consolidation or adhesion at harvest. Calves receiving NSAID actually had numerically in creased lung consolidation compared with calves re ceiving NOAC. Conversely, calves receiving NSAID had a slight numerical decrease in lung adhesion scores when compared with calves receiving NOAC.",

            "text": "When reviewing the existing research, no experi ment utilizing VACC as an ANC for BRD was found. This is extremely surprising given that NAHMS (2013) reported that a respiratory vaccine was used as a com ponent of the initial BRD treatment program in 39.3% of feedlots and that 48.5% of cattle received a respira tory vaccine as part of initial BRD treatment. It is well established that the vaccination of healthy calves for respiratory pathogens is important for preventing BRD and maintaining optimal calf health. However, there is little justification for the vaccination of high-risk calves at arrival to the feedlot even though it is a wide spread and accepted management practice (Edwards, 2010; Taylor et al., 2010) . Some epidemiologic stud ies have suggested that vaccinating calves on arrival to the feedlot for respiratory viruses actually leads to in creased BRD incidence (Taylor et al., 2010) . The data are somewhat confounded as preconditioned low-risk calves would be less likely to be vaccinated on arrival. As a result, the increased BRD incidence observed in calves vaccinated on arrival to the feedlot is not neces sarily a causal response. In addition, most published vaccine research has focused on comparing different multivalent vaccines, and the majority of vaccine stud ies do not include a nonvaccinated negative control. As a result, it is extremely difficult to determine if vac cination of high-risk calves at or shortly after arrival aids in the prevention of BRD or if it actually may be detrimental. Because no published research was found evaluating the use of VACC as an ANC for BRD, comparisons to the data in the present experiment are not possible. It is interesting to note that although not significant, calves that died after receiving VACC in the current experiment did so numerically sooner than any other ANC treatment. This observation was true regardless of whether the interval was measured from the time of arrival to the feedlot or from the time of the first BRD treatment. This response ultimately resulted in the VACC group receiving the fewest total antimi crobial treatments (137 doses) for BRD. However, this was only 8 to 13 total antimicrobial treatments less than the other 3 ANC groups.",

            "text": "When reviewing individual research trials concern ing ANC use for calves with BRD, a few experiments utilizing VITC as an ANC for BRD were identified. In an experiment conducted by Cusack et al. (2005) , the authors examined the effects of injectable vitamin C given at the time of BRD treatment on subsequent cat tle health. At the time of BRD antimicrobial treatment, 176 cattle were alternately administered injectable vita min C (5 g/animal) or not injected. Fewer of the cattle injected with vitamin C at the time of BRD treatment died later in the experiment compared with those cattle that were not injected (11% vs. 23%, respectively; Cu sack et al., 2005) . The results led the authors to con clude that mortality rate in cattle with BRD may be decreased by administering injectable vitamin C at the time of antimicrobial administration. UrbanChmiel et al. (2011) evaluated the effects of vitamin E and vita min C on the development of inflammation processes and selected defense mechanisms against MHinduced infections. Calves were assigned to 3 treatments and received subcutaneous injections of vitamin E (750 IU), vitamin C (2.5 g per head), or no vitamin injection. Calves receiving either of the vitamin injections dem onstrated a difference in the sensitivity of leukocytes to the cytotoxic effect of LKT when compared with the control group (UrbanChmiel et al., 2011) . There were no differences observed in the percentage of cells sen sitive to LKT between the calves receiving vitamin E and those receiving vitamin C. The authors concluded that both vitamin E and vitamin C exerted a protec tive effect on leukocytes aiding in the defense against MH virulence factors when administered by injection. UrbanChmiel et al. (2011) also suggested that these vitamins can be used to support the treatment of BRD in cattle following transport.",

The goal of ANC therapy is to improve the response to a BRD challenge in calves treated with antimicrobials, and there is potential justification for ANC use based on the modes of actions of various ANC. However, published research has yet to suggest that ANC other than NSAID are effective in commer cial settings in response to a natural BRD challenge. Although NSAID have demonstrated the ability to decrease rectal temperatures in treated calves, the re sponse is usually shortlived and not evident at the end of the evaluation period. It has also been suggested that NSAID may decrease lung consolidation at har vest, but this has been demonstrated in only a few experiments. For all of the variables measured in the current experiment, observed responses to the 3 ANC were negligible during both the receiving and finish ing periods. The lack of observed positive responses in calves given the 3 ANC used in this experiment compared with calves receiving NOAC leads us to conclude that the use of NSAID, VACC, and VITC as an ANC for BRD does not appear to be warranted. In addition, this experiment suggests that ANC use could potentially have negative effects on calf performance during the receiving period if administered to calves experiencing a severe natural immune challenge.",
