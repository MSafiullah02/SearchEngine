It is caused by the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has thus far infected >1.5 million people with >500,000 cases in the Unites States alone1. Physicians and scientists are working tirelessly to find a potential drug or vaccine for its treatment. Increased disease severity and mortality have been noted in those with cardiovascular disease who develop COVID-192. Moreover, a decreased potassium level has also been reported in patients with COVID-19, which can cause electrocardiographic changes like prolonged QT interval and may increase the risk of adverse reactions with pharmacotherapies. Hence, understanding the cardiovascular risks of potential pharmacotherapies being investigated for COVID-19 is of utmost importance. Numerous drugs are currently under investigation, some in early phase clinical trials. The drugs of highest interest to-date include chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) alone or in combination with azithromycin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon alpha-2b3. This article reviews the potential cardiovascular risks associated with these drugs.",

High cumulative doses of CQ/HC have been shown to be associated with atrioventricular blocks and cardiac arrest5.

In some of these cases, baseline QT interval was found to be mildly prolonged and hence QT interval is such patients should be closely monitored to prevent risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Given the fact that hypokalemia causes prolongation of QTc interval, low potassium levels in patients with severe COVID-19 may further exacerbate the arrhythmogenic potential of CQ/HCQ. CQ has been found to be more associated with conduction defects compared to HCQ. In a study of 85 patients treated with HCQ for a minimum of 1 year and who had no underlying cardiac disease, HCQ was found to be safe with only two patients developing right bundle branch block and one patient developing left bundle branch block8. There were no instances of atrioventricular blocks or QT prolongation.",

It works against gram positive, gram negative and atypical pathogens. It has been postulated as a possible cure for COVID-19 in combination with CQ/HCQ3. Initially thought to be free of cardiotoxic effects, it was later found to cause QT prolongation and higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Multiple studies have shown the risk of QT prolongation and ventricular tachycardia with azithromycin. Its use has also been linked to risk of atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrest. In a large multinational case-control study, azithromycin use was found to be associated with an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35 to 2.86)12. However, other studies have not revealed similar findings. In a large Canadian cohort, azithromycin use was not associated with risk of ventricular arrhythmia (relative risk [RR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.36)13. The mechanisms by which azithromycin causes arrhythmias in still under investigation. QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias have been postulated to be due to increased Na+ current and inhibition of outward flow of K+ ions from ventricular myocytes 14. QT interval usually returns to baseline once the drug is stopped. However, this could be clinically significant especially when taken for prolonged period or in those patients who are on other QT prolonging drugs. Taking into account the published literature, FDA released a statement in 2013 cautioning the use of azithromycin in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease due to risk of fatal arrhythmias15. Again, as discussed before, hypokalemia seen in COVID-19 patients can further prolong the QTc interval and cause ventricular arrhythmias.",

However, other studies have found no association between azithromycin and cardiovascular disease or mortality. In a large observational study, Svanstrom et al. found increased risk of cardiovascular death with use of azithromycin when compared to no antibiotic use (rate ratio 2.85, 95% CI 1.13 to 7.24)17. However, no difference was found between those on azithromycin versus those on penicillin V (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.55). The authors concluded that excess mortality in patients on azithromycin when compared to those not on antibiotics was most likely due to the mortality risk of the underlying infection itself. An interesting finding among some studies is a trend towards higher mortality in first 5 days of azithromycin use compared to other antibiotics, but no difference from day 618.",

In a study of 295 patients who were treated with interferon-\u03b1 for hepatitis C, cardiac complications were noted in 6 patients during treatment and 4 more within one year after end of treatment 24. A total of 4 patients had arrhythmias, 4 patients had ischemic heart disease and 2 patients developed cardiomyopathy in this study. The increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels during interferon-\u03b1 therapy may be the underlying mechanism mediating its cardiotoxic effects, though this same mechanism may be beneficial in inhibiting viral replication in patients with COVID-1925. Pericardial effusion has been reported to occur with interferon-\u03b1 therapy 26.",

Favipiravir was reported to be associated with mild prolongation of QT interval in a young patient treated for ebolavirus27. High dose of vitamin C was found to be associated with higher cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes 28. Human monoclonal antibodies that inhibit interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway by binding and blocking IL-6 receptor are also bring currently studied for treatment of COVID-19. They have been shown to cause increases in total cholesterol and LDL levels 29. A phase 3 trial evaluating colchicine is ongoing for treatment of patients with COVID-19 that plans to enroll 6000 participants[clinicaltrials.gov NCT04322682]; colchicine has not been linked to cardiovascular side effects but may worsen bleeding. Finally, ACE inhibitors and ARBs are also under investigation for the treatment of COVID. SAR-CoV-2 may directly interact with the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, with the virus using the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its host receptor on type II pneumocytes. As such, a link between angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and COVID has been proposed. However, there is little, if any, convincing evidence to suggest discontinuation of such drugs and ARBs are currently undergoing a clinical trial as a treatment for severe COVID-19.",
