The pathogen, named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] , is responsible for a novel pneumonia affecting the lower respiratory tract, referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 . COVID-19 represents a global pandemic, affecting 212 countries and territories around the world, with over 3.200.000 infected subjects and more than 228.000 deaths. [2] The exponential afflux of patients in need of sub-intensive or intensive care represents, for most of the healthcare systems around the globe, a crisis of unprecedented magnitude in the post-world war era. While the population continues to be affected by the whole spectrum of pre-existing diseases, hospitals were swamped with a massive number of COVID-19 patients to the point that prompted the Administrations to create COVID-19 dedicated wards, ICUs and hospitals with redistribution of healthcare workers (HCW) from non-COVID-19 to COVID-19 intensive and sub-intensive units. In this context, majority of surgical departments were forced, both due to reduced manpower/facilities and to limit the viral spread, to re-schedule their activity giving priority to urgent/emergent and non-deferrable oncological cases. The prioritization of patients is a complex strategy that poses several organizational and ethical issues.",

MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases were searched up to April 24 th 2020. The following terms were searched, individually or in combination: 'pandemic', 'coronavirus', 'COVID-19', and 'surgery' or 'surgical'. Moreover, a Google search of the topic related key words was also conducted along with national and international Surgical Societies and Health Institutions websites. References of the included papers were checked to identify any additional study and the related articles function was used. After eliminating double hits, two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts for eligibility. For potentially relevant records, the full-text guidelines were obtained, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Articles and guidelines in English language, reporting practical indications on operative and perioperative management during pandemics were included. Given the lack of high-quality evidence on the COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of the pandemic, we included guidelines irrespective of their methodological level and their development process. In fact, most of decision-making and guideline development on this topic are based on the limited available data and information inferred from other viruses and similar epidemics. Moreover, expert opinions and author's experiences in endemic areas were considered. Editorial, commentaries, duplicated and non-English articles were excluded. We analyzed statements and recommendations regarding elective/oncologic/emergency surgery, laparoscopy, and operations in COVID-19 positive patients.",

[23] ACS [25] distinguishes three acute pandemic phases based on hospital resources availability and COVID-19 patients burden: a progressive restriction of surgical activity follows the pandemic escalation and the potential impairment of survivorship if surgery is not performed in a determinate interval of time ( Criteria for surgical prioritization are reported by British National Health Service (NHS) [5] , ACS [26] and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [11] guidelines. The NHS guidelines [5] suggest to classify patients requiring surgery according to four levels of surgical priority (Table 2 ). Operations are distinguished in emergent (<24 hours), urgent (<72 hours) and elective (deferrable for up to 4 weeks, 3 months and beyond 3 months), providing a detailed list of surgical procedures for each category. [5] During the pandemic, surgery that can be deferred for up to 4 weeks might still be performed, balancing the risk between the underlying condition and the viral spread. This category includes some cancer operations and surgery for complicated benign conditions unresponsive to medical therapy. ACS [26] identifies different tiers of surgical procedures according to acuity of surgery (high, intermediate and low according to Elective Surgery Acuity Scale) and patient's general condition. High acuity surgery (most cancers and highly symptomatic patients) should not be delayed during the pandemic. ESMO [11] identifies three levels of priority (high, medium and low), defined by incorporating the evaluation of the patient's overall clinical condition and the expected benefit provided by the intervention in terms of survival and quality of life.",

This measure increases the resources for COVID-19 patients, clearing ward and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Moreover, it avoids unnecessary patient traffic in the hospital and reduces the risk of cross-infection between elective patients, hospital visitors and COVID-19 patients, preventing spread of infection from the hospital to the community. [19, 27] If on one hand, postponing elective procedures is necessary, on the other, every delay in treatment, may lead to adverse outcomes. Clinicians should assess the risk of proceeding and delaying surgery considering that a possible time of 6-7 weeks could be necessary to see a decrease in COVID-19 prevalence. [26] As suggested by all Authors, a clear surgical strategy and a plan for providing essential operations during the pandemic should be developed, in order to keep the system effective. Due to a rapidly changing environment, keeping the Triage criteria in mind, all surgical systems will need to constantly adapt to the continuously evolving situation. In particular, surgical planning must take local resources constraints into account as a means to understand the potential impact of each decision. [28] ",

            "text": "[29] Inflammatory and locally advanced breast cancers should receive NAT prior to surgery. [25] High priority should be given to patients who have completed NAT and to those progressing on NAT. [12, 25, 29] Other indications to non-deferrable surgery are: breast cancer in pregnancy [29], excision of malignant recurrence (depending on phenotype and extent) [25, 29] , and discordant biopsies likely to be malignant. [25, 29] In situation where hospital resources are all directed to COVID-19 patients, surgery should be limited to urgent /emergent situations such as breast abscesses, evacuation of hematomas, revision of an ischemic flap. [25, 29] The following scenarios can be safely postponed for the duration of the pandemic: benign lesions and duct excision, discordant biopsies likely to be benign, noninvasive breast cancer (in situ) except for extended high-grade DCIS, breast reconstruction, prophylactic surgery. [25, 29] Consider adjuvant hormone/chemotherapy and radiation for minimal margin involvement, delaying margin re-resection. Same principles should be followed in breast cancers candidates to additional axillary surgery. [25] B) Colorectal cancer Urgent surgery should be performed for: obstructive or nearly-obstructing colorectal cancer (prefer diversion in rectal cancer), acutely transfusion-dependent tumors, cancers with pending evidence of local perforation and sepsis, post-surgical and post-colonoscopy complications. [25] For resectable colon cancer, curative intent surgery should be carried out, while NAT could be considered for locally advanced colon cancer. [12] For rectal cancer, all options for NAT should be considered. In post-neoadjuvant rectal cancer, priority should be given to those with no response to therapy. [25] In situation where hospital resources are all directed to COVID-19 patients, surgery should be limited to emergent situations (perforation, peritonitis, massive gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis), considering patients' transfer to hospital with capacity in all other cases. [25] The following scenarios can be safely postponed: malignant polyps, prophylactic surgery for hereditary conditions, large, benign, asymptomatic polyps, small, asymptomatic colon and rectal carcinoids. [12, 30] C) Gastric and Esophageal cancer Priority should be given to surgical resection of cT1b lesions and patients with ongoing perioperative treatment. cT1a tumors should undergo endoscopic management if feasible while patients with cT2 cancer or higher should undergo NAT. [12, 25] Timing of surgery after NAT should be individualized by balancing the risk of progression with the risk of surgery and SARS-CoV-2 infection. [13] The capacity of ICU has to be considered prior to perform esophagectomy, especially in patients who are at higher risk of prolonged ICU stay. [13, 25] If the COVID-19 pandemic escalates, patients should prolong chemotherapy, if tolerating and responding, or switched to definitive chemoradiation, offering salvage surgery only in case of failure. [12, 25] In situation where hospital resources are limited, surgery should be restricted to emergencies such as perforated cancers, tumor associated infection/sepsis, surgical complications management. Transfer of patients to other centers should be considered. [25, 31] Procedure that can be postponed after the pandemic are: functional operations, bariatric surgery, surgery for benign non-aggressive tumors of the GI tract. [13] D) Hepatopancreatobiliary cancer Potentially curable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (included those who have completed NAT and those with biliary/gastric obstruction), pancreatic cystic lesions with confirmed high grade dysplasia, duodenal cancer, ampullary cancer, potentially curable large/multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma should undergo surgical resection. [12, 25, 32, 33] When resources are limited, patient can prolong NAT when responding and tolerating. [12] If pandemic escalates, only emergent life-saving interventions should be performed (e.g. drainage for cholangitis, gastric outlet obstruction and bleeding management). [25] E) Neuroendocrine tumors (NET), thyroid and adrenal cancer Surgery should be restricted to symptomatic or growing small bowel/pancreatic NET. [12] Surgery should not be postponed in thyroid cancer with a current or impending threat to life, morbidity due to local invasion and aggressive biology and in adrenocortical cancer, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma and medically resistant Cushing's syndrome.

A constant communication should be present regarding regional distribution of patients, ICU capacity, ventilators allocation. [14, 15] Status of blood stocks should be regularly checked. [15] In case of reduced availability of red blood concentrates (RBC), plasma-first approach using an inverse ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to blood (2 FFP to 1 RBC) can be adopted. [14] Anyhow, the consultant in transfusion medicine has to be involved in decision-making as early as possible.

In complicated diverticulitis, conservative approach should be maximized: IV antibiotics and percutaneous drainage for Hinchey class 1 and 2.

[42] Aerosolization of blood born viruses has been previously detected in surgical smoke during laparoscopy. [43, 44] Therefore, a potential risk of aerosol exposure must be considered also for SARS-CoV-2 even though there isn't current demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in the surgical smoke. [16] On the other hand, proven benefits of laparoscopy should be considered during COVID-19 pandemic, such as reduced length of stay and complications (and a potential minor burden on healthcare system). Moreover, at the present, there is very little evidence about the relative risks of laparoscopy versus open surgery, specific to COVID-19. [7] While laparoscopy has the potential for ultrafiltration of the majority if not all aerosolized particles, open surgery has a similar potential to generate aerosols without the possibility of safely containing the surgical smoke. [7, 17, 45] From the Literature review, we can conclude that a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation considering surgeon expertise, patient-and disease-related factors provided that appropriate PPE and OR equipment are available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission.",

[7, 9, [19] [20] [21] [22] Negative pressure ORs are considered ideal [21, 46] ; however, most ORs work at positive pressure and their use is therefore obviously permitted. [7, 9, 20, 41, 47] An air exchange rate >25 cycles/hour is considered sufficient to effectively reduce the viral load within the OR. [22] Only essential members of the staff should be admitted in the OR, limiting in/out traffic, doors should be kept closed. A HCW should remain outside the OR for supplies that should be delivered through charts to avoid handling-related contamination. Only essential equipment should be kept in, patients' records should be kept outside. [6, 7, 9, [19] [20] [21] [22] 41, 47] All operators involved in the procedure should be tracked to identify HCWs at risk of infection. [20] The use of energy devices should be limited and at the lowest possible setting and long dissection in the same spot should be avoided. [7, 16] The Authors recommend a thorough use of smoking evacuators and avoidance of leakage through port incisions. [6, 7, 13, 16, 47] Pneumoperitoneum should be kept at the lowest possible levels and electromedical units' surfaces should be covered. [16, 20, 22] C) Postoperative management Extubation should occur, with essential personnel, in a negative pressure ICU/ward room or, if not available, in the OR. [19] [20] [21] 24, 41, 48] The PPE should be discarded in a dedicated doffing area. Scrubs should be changed after each procedure and showering is encouraged. [20] [21] [22] At the end of the operation the breathing circuit and the canister of soda lime should be discarded. [22] The OR should be kept empty to allow air exchange (from 15-20/hour to >25/hour for approximately 30 minutes), cleaning service can then follow. [9, 13, 20, 21] The CDC advocates the appropriateness of EPA-registered disinfectants contained in the List N for routine cleaning and disinfection. [46] ",

In accordance with the WHO and the CDC [1, 46] , aerosol generating procedures (tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, manual ventilation, bronchoscopy) should be performed in negative pressure ante-rooms, subsequently transferring the patient to the OR. Since such logistical resources are rarely available in the surgical departments, several authors prompt the use of the OR for patients' induction and recovery, in order to overcome this issue. [6, 13, 19, 20, 22, 24] Similarly, while negative pressure ORs are considered ideal to minimize the infection risk [21, 46] , given their greater availability the use of positive pressure ORs is widely accepted for the for the treatment of COVID-19 cases [7, 9, 19, 20, 22, 24] , provided that an adequate air exchange rate is utilized. [20, 22] From our review of the literature we can conclude that the viral spread through aerosol generating procedures and direct/indirect contact can be efficiently reduced by a rational use of the available spaces, even in absence of more advanced containment structures.",

According to the Italian NationalInstitute of Health, out of 1738 verified COVID-19 related deaths occurred in Italy up to April 16 th , 16.2% had a history of active cancer in the last 5 years.[34] A nationwide analysis from China reported 18 out of 1590 COVID-19 cases with a history of cancer (1%; 95% CI 0.61-1.65).[35] Cancer patients were reported to have a higher risk of severe clinical events, requiring invasive ventilation or leading to death, when compared with patients without cancer (HR 3.56 [95%CI, 1.65 to 7.69]). Clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure, taking into account limitation of healthcare resources that need to be allocated properly.[36,37] All",
