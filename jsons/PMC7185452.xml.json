The behaviours included hand washing, respiratory hygiene, mask wearing, using utensils, and washing after touching contaminated surfaces. An Internet survey carried out during the beginning of the H1N1 swine flu outbreak found that older age was associated with more frequent hand washing (Jones & Salathe, 2009). Older people are more likely to say they intend to be vaccinated against influenza during an outbreak of SARS (Hong & Collins, 2006). Older people have also been found to be more likely to report that they would take self\u2010protective behaviours in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza (Lau, Kim, Tsui, & Griffiths, 2007a) or an influenza pandemic in the future (Barr et al., 2008). Research by Barr et al. (2008) may explain the association between older age and behaviour in that they found that older people feel more susceptible to being affected by a possible influenza pandemic. In the context of the threat of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the pattern of results for age was different, with people aged 18\u201324 more likely to follow recommended behaviours (hand washing more, cleaning surfaces more, and having plans for a flu friend\n2, \n) than older people (Rubin, Aml\u00f4t, Page, & Wessely, 2009). A cross\u2010sectional study of adolescents in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak found that younger adolescents were more likely to report mask wearing (Wong & Tang, 2005).",

In addition, an Internet survey found that women were more likely than men to report increased hand\u2010washing at the beginning of the swine flu pandemic (Jones & Salathe, 2009). This association between gender and behaviour may be because women have been found to perceive themselves as more susceptible, for example to SARS, than men do (Brug et al., 2004). In contrast, there were no gender differences found in one Australian study for intentions to wear a mask (Barr et al., 2008) or actual face mask use in studies carried out in The Netherlands and Hong Kong (Brug et al., 2004; Tang & Wong, 2004; Wong & Tang, 2005).

A cross\u2010sectional study in the USA found that Hispanic respondents were more likely than Black or White respondents to say they would have a vaccine for swine flu and additionally Hispanic and White respondents were more likely than Black respondents to say that they would take an antiviral drug (Quinn et al., 2009).

Some studies in addition to assessing personal perceived susceptibility also include an assessment of the association between perceived susceptibility of an individual's family to developing the disease and behaviour (e.g., Lau, Kim, Tsui, & Griffiths, 2007b). Associations between greater perceived risk and likelihood of hand washing (Brug et al., 2004; Jones & Salathe, 2009; Lau et al., 2003; Rubin et al., 2009; Tang & Wong, 2003); good personal hygiene (Tang & Wong, 2005; Wong & Tang, 2005) disinfecting the home (Lau et al., 2003; Rubin et al., 2009; Wong & Tang, 2005) mask wearing (Lau, Yang, Tsui, & Pang, 2004; Lau, Yang, Tsui, Pang, & Kim, 2004; Tang & Wong, 2003; Wong & Tang, 2005); building up body immunity with diet and exercise (Tang & Wong, 2005; Wong & Tang, 2005); being vaccinated (Barr et al., 2008) and adopting other precautionary behaviours to protect against SARS including hand washing, respiratory hygiene, mask wearing, using utensils, and washing after touching contaminated surfaces (Barr et al., 2008; Leung et al., 2003, 2004) have been found.

Further research is required to clarify the influence of these demographic factors on behaviour. Theories of behaviour suggest that their influence is mediated by differing attitudes. Further research analysing these possible mediators would enable communication strategies to target relevant attitudes. For example, a recent intervention study designed to increase hand washing found gender differences: men tended to be motivated more by messages highlighting the disgust of not washing ones hands, whereas women were more influenced by \u2018knowledge activation\u2019 \u2013 which involved being reminded of what they know already about the advantages of hand washing (Judah et al., 2009).",

If attitudes were assessed using reliable measures developed from psychological theory before an outbreak it would be possible to see if these attitudes predicted subsequent behaviour during a pandemic. In addition, it is important to carry out behavioural research during a pandemic where actual behaviour can be measured. This should include a variety of designs, including observational and experimental, and types of data, both quantitative and qualitative. Findings from such studies would add to the literature in that more confident conclusions could be drawn about influences on behaviour. The results from these types of studies could then be used to develop targeted interventions to encourage appropriate protective behavioural responses during a pandemic. For example, the finding that perceiving oneself to be more susceptible to the illness is associated with engaging in protective behaviours highlights the need to focus on perceptions of risk in communications. A certain level of perceived susceptibility is required to get people to take action. Communications designed to highlight perceptions of risk should also be combined with advice as to how the perceived threat can be lessened. For example, by emphasizing that risk can be reduced by carrying out the recommended protective actions and providing information about the efficacy of such measures in reducing risk. However, recent work has shown the conceptual and empirical limitations of social cognition models in informing behaviour change interventions (e.g., Sniehotta, 2009). Studies \u2018testing\u2019 social cognition models are usually observational, non\u2010experimental studies, limiting the possibility of drawing causal inferences. For example, assumptions should not be made about the direction of causality (i.e., that attitudes cause behaviour and not the other way around) or about the stability of any observed relationship over time (see Sutton, 2002).",

In sum, the review shows that there are demographic differences in behaviour: being older, female and more educated, or non\u2010White, is associated with a higher chance of adopting the behaviours. There is evidence that greater levels of perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of the diseases and greater belief in the effectiveness of recommended behaviours to protect against the disease are also important predictors of behaviour. There is also evidence that greater levels of state anxiety and greater trust in authorities are associated with behaviour. The findings from this review can be broadly explained by theories of health behaviour. However, theoretically driven prospective studies are required to further clarify the relationship between demographic factors, attitudes, and behaviour. The findings suggest that intervention studies should focus on particular demographic groups and on raising levels of perceived threat of the pandemic disease and belief in the effectiveness of measures designed to protect against it. Communication strategies should maximize levels of trust amongst the public by being open and transparent in order to maintain the credibility of the information provided.
