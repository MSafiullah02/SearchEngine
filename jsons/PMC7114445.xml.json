            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) belongs to the alpha coronaviruses of the family Coronaviridae. FCoV is classified into serotypes I and II according to Spike (S) protein properties (Hohdatsu et al., 1991b, Motokawa et al., 1995, Motokawa et al., 1996). Each of these types consists of two viruses: feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-causing FIP virus (FIPV) and non-FIP-causing feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Pedersen et al., 1981). FIPV and FECV of the same serotype cannot be distinguished by their antigenicity or at the gene level, and differ only in their pathogenicity for cats (Pedersen, 2009). Cats that developed FIP were affected in several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen, and central nervous system, forming lesions accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation. In some cats, pleural effusion and ascitic fluid accumulated. When anti-FCoV antibody-positive cats are inoculated with FIPV, the onset time of FIP is earlier than that in antibody-negative cats, and symptoms are severer (Baldwin and Scott, 1997, Barlough et al., 1984, Pedersen, 2009, Pedersen et al., 1981, Stoddart et al., 1988, Weiss and Scott, 1981). These results of experimented studies suggest that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection can be a serious obstacle to the prevention of FIP by vaccination.",

The S protein exists as radially protruding trimers on the viral envelope, and can be structurally or functionally divided into two domains, namely the S1 and S2 domains, representing the N-terminal globular head and C-terminal membrane-bound stalk, respectively. The C-terminal S1 domain contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), neutralizing antibody-binding epitope, and ADE epitope (Corapi et al., 1992, Corapi et al., 1995, Hohdatsu et al., 1991a, Hohdatsu et al., 1993, Hohdatsu et al., 1998b, Kida et al., 1999, Olsen et al., 1992).

            "text": "Over the past forty years, several studies have investigated potential treatments for FIP (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008). Antiviral, immunostimulating, and immunosuppressive drugs have been experimentally used for the treatment of FIP, but few of these have exhibited a sufficient therapeutic effect. Several agents that significantly inhibit FCoV replication in vitro have been identified (Balzarini et al., 2006, Barlough and Shacklett, 1994, Hsieh et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2012, Takano et al., 2008, Takano et al., 2013). Peptides based on viral protein amino acid sequences have recently been attracting attention as new antiviral drugs. These peptides bind to viral proteins or receptors on cells and inhibit viral infections. A HIV infection-inhibiting peptide with a HIV-derived sequence is currently used in the human medical field to treat patients with HIV (He, 2013). This peptide specifically binds to the HIV fusion protein and blocks cell membrane fusion induced by the fusion protein. Furthermore, a peptide with a sequence derived from the RBD of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) specifically binds to the virus receptor on cells and competitively inhibits JEV infection, clarifying that peptides with viral protein-derived sequences inhibit viral infections by binding to the virus and virus receptor (Li et al., 2012, Li et al., 2014). Liu et al. (2013) reported that an FIPV fusion protein-derived peptide exhibited an antiviral effect. Although an FIPV RBD-derived peptide may exhibit antiviral activity, this has not yet been investigated. If an RBD-derived peptide with antiviral activity can be identified, it may be applicable as an antiviral agent against FIPV.",

To evaluate the inhibitory effects on type I FIPV infection of these peptides, we initially investigated a method to increase the infection efficiency of type I FIPV. To accurately evaluate inhibitory effect on type I FIPV infection, we examined the addition of a polycation or polyanion to a diluted viral suspension. When a viral suspension was diluted with medium containing a polycation and subjected to the infection of fcwf-4 cells, the number of Type I FIPV plaques increased in a manner dependent on the polycation concentration. In contrast, when a viral suspension was diluted with polyanion-containing medium, the number of plaques decreased in a manner dependent on the polyanion concentration. A polycation-induced increase and polyanion-induced decrease in viral infection efficiency have been reported for other viruses, such as TGEV, MHV, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Bailey et al., 1984, Hirano et al., 1978, Nguyen et al., 1987). Bailey et al. (1984) demonstrated that positively charged polycations increased electrostatic interactions between viral particles and cell surfaces, promoting the binding of viral particles to the cells. Similarly, the polycation may have enhanced electrostatic interactions between the virus and cell surface and increased type I FIPV infection efficiency.",

The isoelectric points of these peptides were acidic, suggesting that the peptides reduced the effect of the polycation and decreased the number of plaques. However, I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 significantly inhibited type I FIPV strain KU-2 infection regardless of the polycation concentration. Moreover, I-S1-18 showed no infection-inhibitory effect although its isoelectric point was as low as that of I-S1-9. Based on these findings, the infection-inhibitory effect was exhibited regardless of the charge of the peptides. In addition, I-S1-8 and I-S1-10 partially overlapped the amino acid sequence of I-S1-9, and these peptides have similar inhibitory effect as I-S19. In contrast, I-S1-7 (partially overlapping I-S1-8) and I-S1-11 (partially over lapping I-S1-10) did not show inhibitory effect. These findings suggested that the amino acid sequence of I-S1-9 was very important for exhibiting inhibitory effects on FIPV infection.",

            "text": "In the present study, we synthesized overlapping peptides based on the amino acid sequence of the S1 domain of the type I FIPV strain KU-2 S protein, in which the presence of RBD is expected. On the basis of previous reports, the S1 domain of FIPV is expected to involve in RBD (Breslin et al., 2003, Reguera et al., 2012, Regan et al., 2012). Li et al. reported that a JEV RBD-derived peptide inhibited JEV infection by competitively blocking the binding of JEV to cells (Li et al., 2012, Li et al., 2014). Reguera et al. (2012) reported TGEV RBD. I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 regions, which exhibited inhibitory effects on type I and II FIPV infection, were included in TGEV RBD. In the inhibition test of FIPV adsorption to fcwf-4 cells by I-S1-9, viral binding to fcwf-4 cells was found to be reduced. Based on this result, it was assumed that at least I-S1-9 competitively inhibited viral binding to cells, which significantly decreased FIPV infection efficiency. However, inhibitory effects on FIPV infection were markedly decreased when cells were inoculated with the virus after being pre-sensitized with I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 peptides and washed. These findings indicate that the peptides interact with virus protein, but not with cellular virus receptors. However the data in Fig. 5 could be explained by the internalization of peptide-bound receptor, and replacement by a new population via membrane recycling. Further investigations are beeded to elucidate the action mechanism of these peptides in more detail.",

We investigated the inhibitory effects of these peptides on other type I and II FIPV strains, FHV, and FCV infection. I-S1-9 significantly inhibited both type I and II FIPV infections by 50% or more. I-S1-16 inhibited infections with all type I FIPV strains by 50% or more, but its effect on type II FIPV infection was less than 50%. In a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the S protein among the coronavirus strains, the I-S1-16 amino acid sequence showed 75-80% identity and 90% similarity to type I FIPV, excluding KU-2, but only 20% identity and 30-35% similarity to type II FIPV (Fig. 1), suggesting that the reduced inhibitory effects of I-S1-16 on type II FIPV infection were attributed to reduced amino acid sequence homology. In contrast, the I-S1-9 amino acid sequence was well conserved between type I and II FIPV. These results suggest that I-S1-9 has broad antiviral activity against feline coronavirus regardless of serotypes. Furthermore, the similarity of the effect between type I and type II FIPV suggests that there is a common receptor binding site for the two viruses. However, previous studies showed that type I and type II FIPV have distinct receptors (Hohdatsu et al., 1998a, Hohdatsu et al., 1998b). The reasons for this discrepancy are unknown. In any case, to elucidate it, identification of the virus receptor for type I FIPV is necessary.",

These 2 types do not serologically cross-react with each other (Pedersen et al., 1984, Shiba et al., 2007). Since type II FIPV more actively replicates in cell lines and is more pathogenic for cats, previous studies on FIPV and anti-FIPV agents were performed using type II FIPV; however, studies have not yet been conducted to search for effective antiviral agents against type I FIPV. Since many cats are infected with type I FIPV in the field, it is important for clinical veterinarians to prepare an anti-FIPV agent effective against type I FIPV (Addie et al., 2003, Hohdatsu et al., 1992, Kummrow et al., 2005, Shiba et al., 2007). In the present study, we identified peptides exhibiting coronavirus-specific infection-inhibitory effects. I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 showed marked inhibitory effects on all type I FIPV strains infection, suggesting that these peptides are also effective for wild strains. In addition, I-S1-9 showed marked inhibitory effects on not only type I, but also type II FIPV infection, suggesting its practical applicability as an anti-FIPV agent.",

After incubation at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min, cells were washed and the fluorescein intensity of cells were determined by counting about 5000 cells on a flow cytometer. (A and B) Fluorescence intensity histograms of fcwf-4 cells inoculated with a mixture of DMSO or a peptide and the virus Black line; cells treated with medium, dotted line; cells inoculated with virus, red line; Cells inoculated with a mixture of DMSO or a peptide and the virus. (C) The percent inhibition of virus absorption. The percentage inhibition was calculated from the mean fluorescein intensity (MFI) regarded as a level of viral adsorption to fcwf-4 cells in each sample. The inhibition of viral adsorption by DMSO or a peptide was calculated using the following equation: inhibition of virus absorption (%) = {(MFI of sample containing virus alone \u2212 MFI of sample containing peptide or DMSO)/MFI of sample containing virus alone} \u00d7 100. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the figure shows mean \u00b1 standard errors.",
