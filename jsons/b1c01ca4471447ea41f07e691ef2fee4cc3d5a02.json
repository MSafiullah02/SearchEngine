There were no clinical signs of infection in either multiparous sows or live-born infants. Two strains of PCV3 were indentified from natural stillborn foetuses. Phylogenetic analysis showed the two strains of PCV3 are 96% identical to the known PCV3/Pig/USA (KX778720.1, KX966193.1 and KX898030.1) and closely related to Barbel Circovirus. Further studies of the epidemiology of PCV3 and the co-infection with PCV2 are needed.",

PCV2 is the primary causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD) in swine; PCVAD has been referred to by different names, the most common being postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Furthermore, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia, respiratory disease and enteritis were also linked to PCV2 infections (Allan et al., 2000; Madson et al., 2009; Grau-Roma & Segal es, 2007; Cheng et al., 2011; Kim & Chae, 2004) and have caused a huge economic loss to the pig industry worldwide. PCV3, a novel genotype of PCV, was first reported in pigs with cardiac and multisystemic inflammation in 2016 (Phan et al., 2016) . About the same time, pigs were detected having PCV3 with PDNS, and reproductive failure was reported (Palinski et al., 2016) .",

The intergenic region (IR) contains the origin of replication with a stem-loop (SL) structure, which includes an octanucleotide sequence (Oc8) flanked by palindromes (Faurez, Dory, Grasland, & Jestin, 2009) . Two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encode replicase (Rep) and capsid protein (Cap), respectively. Cap contains one putative N-glycosylation site at position 143-145aa (NYS) (Nawagitgul et al., 2002) , while Rep contains three potential glycosylation sites at positions 23-25aa (NPS), 256-258aa (NQT) and 286-288aa (NAT) (Mankertz, Mankertz, Wolf, & Buhk, 1998) . Regarding clinical aspects, PCV2 is ubiquitous, having both domestic and feral swine hosts; most pigs become infected at 4-11 weeks of age. The common presenting clinical signs of PMWS include wasting or unthriftiness, dyspnoea and visibly enlarged lymph nodes (Segales, Allan, & Domingo, 2005) . Characteristic PDNS symptoms are irregular, red-to-purple macules and papules in the skin; subcutaneous haemorrhages and oedema of affected areas; enlarged lymph nodes, mainly inguinal superficial; cutaneous scars in animals that have recovered from the acute phase; bilaterally enlarged kidneys; small cortical petechiae and oedema of the renal pelvis; and occasional spleen infarcts (Segal es, 2012).",
