SARS-CoV-2 now adds to the list of coronavirus diseases that have threatened global health, along with the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronaviruses that emerged in 2002/2003 and 2012, respectively. As of April 2020, no vaccine is commercially available for these coronavirus strains. Nevertheless, the knowledge obtained from the vaccine development efforts for MERS and SARS can be of high value for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Here, we review the past and ongoing vaccine development efforts for clinically relevant coronavirus strains with the intention that this information helps in the development of effective and safe vaccines for COVID-19. In addition, information from naturally exposed individuals and animal models to coronavirus strains is described for the same purpose of helping into the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19.",

In the case of MERS, it is likely that the vaccine development was delayed because of the scarcity of suitable and cost-effective small animal models during pre-clinical experimentation. In addition, it is probable that a vaccine has not been delivered because of the low interest in investing in a vaccine for a disease that has produced relatively low and geographically centralized cases (compared with other more global and persistent infectious diseases such as influenza, HIV and tuberculosis). This last factor might have also contributed to the lack of a vaccine for SARS, in the sense that it was considered pointless to continue investing in a vaccine for a disease whose cases ceased to be reported in 2004.",

Neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that bind and neutralize virus infection of host cells [105] . Vaccinated animals and passive immunization approaches focusing on the MERS and SARS S glycoproteins induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies that correlated with protection [39, 43, 45, 49, 53, 106, 107] . Nevertheless, it is still in doubt whether adaptive T cell responses (another arm of the immune system) can also play a role in conferring protection, with few studies addressing this issue. As an example, a group of researchers demonstrated that specific CD4? and CD8? T cell peptides against SARS-CoV could be exploited to provide protection in mice [37, 108, 109] . Another study pointed out that the protection against SARS-CoV in mice induced by a DNA vaccine was due only to antibody responses (depletion of CD4/CD8? T cells and adoptive T cell transfer did not have an effect on protection) [45] . In MERS, vaccination efficacy in non-human primates has been correlated to the induction of CD8? T cell responses (in addition to neutralizing antibodies) when using DNA-based vaccines [78] . It is then likely that protection induced by vaccination might be dependent on different factors such as the selected vaccination platform, antigens, animal models and routes of vaccination.",

Even though there seems to be little direct evidence proving this idea, vaccines based on these regions have already been tested, allowing the induction of high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a certain level of protection in small animals and non-human primates [49, 50, 56, 78] .",

As previously mentioned, there is the potential of providing long-term cross-protection when employing this antigen.
