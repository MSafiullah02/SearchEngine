The need for protection against and responses to biological threats has been strikingly demonstrated by the use of anthrax contaminated letters that were sent through the U.S. mail in October 2001. That attack resulted in human illness, the loss of life, and discontinuity of government operations because of contamination of federal office buildings in Washington, DC. A recent report prepared by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) of the Department of Defense (DoD) came to the conclusion that the U.S. is at present not well prepared for a similar attack using anthrax1. The major problems include a lack of: 1) a clear chain of command, and 2) tools to provide the public with information that permits appropriate responses.",

            "text": "The current paradigm addresses biological and chemical terrorist threats in a vertical (stove-piped) response. In the arena of developing sensors for the detection of biological agents, the paradigm has been to develop separate detectors for each agent or to develop a platform for detecting 12-24 threat agents using a single probe for each agent. There is a lack of an interactive networked communication system that is capable of managing a devastating emergent disease. To establish a highly networked system that is rapid enough to permit effective protection, it is necessary to evolve from the stove-piped, compartmentalized model currently in use to an integrated, fused, probabilistic, and frequently updated information model. Multiplexed multi-array sensor systems, capable of recognizing all bacterial or viral genomic materials related to pathogenicity or of recognizing antigenic domains that are specific indicators of pathogens are one component of a network needed for rapid detection and identification of biological threats. With respect to therapeutics, modern technologies for vaccine and antibiotic production provide decided advantages over older methods. The traditional vaccines require extensive development times before they become available for human use and undesired side effects commonly result from vaccines produced by these protocols. The cost associated with developing and testing vaccines, using traditional technology, approximates 50-100 million dollars per vaccine. The dissemination of antibiotics and antivirals through the world markets has resulted in the appearance of pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are resistant to these drugs. One approach to reduce the development of antibiotic resistance is to restrict the distribution of newly developed antibiotics. Such an approach presents ethical and social dilemmas. The consideration of options available for reduction of drug resistance, prior to a threat event, may permit development of a rational policy. A major problem facing our nations in the event of a biological attack or emergent disease is the large numbers of patients that can be anticipated to require medical treatment. Although improvements in emergency medical care and hospital equipment have been achieved during the past two decades, the ability of any community to manage an outbreak of infectious disease affecting >10,000 people is lacking. Rapid progress has been achieved whereby medical care can be provided to patients at sites that are distant from primary caregivers using telecommunication systems (e.g., the Armed Services in theater, large scale HMO providers such as Kaiser Permanente, or the correctional institutions in the U.S.). The funds needed to acquire telecommunication equipment for such distributed medical care delivery are estimated to be less than 100 million dollars for the entire U.S. At the present time such a distributed care system is not readily available.",

Ambiguity of data, lack of an autonomous processing system, and high stress on the operator (e.g., sleep deprivation, lack of training) may all compromise the utility of a highly networked system of systems. What is needed for this new paradigm to succeed? The needs include multiplexed multi-array sensors for biological agents that infect people, livestock, and edible crops. The agents of concern include many on the Militarily Critical Technologies List prepared for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. We need multiplexed multi-array sensor systems with high specificity and selectivity for the rapid detection of host responses to infection. We need a new generation of effective therapeutics, including vaccines, antibiotics, and antivirals. A network centric intelligent communication system that can provide accurate comprehensible information to decision makers (from command officers to unit operators) is required. To minimize morbidity and mortality and optimize containment of disease, a biosurveillance system based on archival health databases, statistical models, and data mining strategies that can provide an early alert to a disease outbreak is required.",

In the biological threat arena, the detection and identification of toxins require rapid analysis and operator comprehension.

The antibodies were produced using phage display technology for selection of the antibodies. In tests with experimental rodents in a controlled facility, administering the Bacillus anthracis PA antigen to the animals resulted in 100 percent fatalities, whereas the co-administration of the newly developed antibody against the PA antigen resulted in 100 percent survival2. Research is also being conducted to determine unique nucleic acid sequences in the genome of pathogenic bacteria and viruses that contribute to the pathogenic properties of the organisms. This information is being used to develop multiplexed assay systems that can detect selected agents simultaneously. By quickly screening for multiple pathogenicity island sequences or pathogenic factors, end-users will have the capability to detect the first signs of emergent disease without requiring screening for each particular organism. In the communications area, researchers are developing 'belief maintenance' software to provide decision makers some estimate of the validity of incoming data. An estimate of information credibility is critical to effective decision-making in crisis situations when one must rely on an 80 percent solution (i.e., 80 percent of needed information is available). Waiting for a 100 percent solution could have a catastrophic impact on response effectiveness.",

In the event of smallpox attack in which 10,000 people develop clinical symptoms of infection within 7-10 days following exposure, local hospitals and medical response capabilities would be overwhelmed if current treatment protocols were used. Telemedicine allows physicians at a remote location from the hot zone to provide medical support via telemedicine capabilities (visual, audio) to aid local physicians in treating patients. A treatment level of 50 patients per day per physician would require 200 physicians to provide telemedicine care for 10,000 patients. Each physician would require telemedicine devices; hence 200 telemedicine devices would be required at the remote location, and a similar number in the hot zone. A national telemedicine system could include the establishment of approximately eight telemedicine response centers nationally, interconnected via satellite to telepresence and telemedicine/robotic systems.

The three technologies are systems that must be developed prior to deployment and will have known probabilities of accuracy and reliability. The fourth element involves the training and state of vigilance/alertness of the operator as well as the development of software (e.g., icons, data mining, and compression) used to display threat conditions. The point of the fourth element is to permit an operator to have rapid comprehension of the state of threat in a rapidly changing environment. Because there is a time factor involved in the comprehension of threat conditions by an operator, and in the translation of the information into action, the fourth element must include temporal qualities. Since the time dependence (seconds to minutes) of an intense threat situation will differ from that involved in a peacekeeping or supply distribution situation (many minutes to hours on the average), the autonomous weighting factors and data reduction factors can be expected to vary widely.
