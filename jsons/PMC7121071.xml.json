We note that it was not important that the perception was not informed from the best science: what mattered was that this misperception spread faster than other, more correct perceptions, and it was ostensibly confirmed by the subsequent course of the epidemic, which was mild only in comparison to what had been feared based on the early, confused events in Mexico. So eventually only a small proportion were immunized. What happened with MMR uptake in the UK was that news reports of the Wakefield study suddenly raised the perceived risk of VAE, thereby making the perceived utility of vaccination strongly negative. Especially in the context of very low measles circulation at the time, many parents therefore decided not to immunize their children. We note that the perception of measles rarity was \u201cmyopic\u201d\u2014rarity was the consequence of herd immunity generated by 20 years of successful immunization\u2014but this is not relevant.

The most important among such milestones is the homogeneous mixing SIR (susceptible-infective-recovered) model in its two variations, for epidemic outbreaks as seasonal influenza and for endemic infections as measles in large communities in absence of any immunization [3]. In this class of models, behavior is absent: individuals contact (and infect) each other at random, as particles of a perfect gas (the so-called law of mass action [28]) and therefore behavioral influences are ruled out by definition.",

            "text": "In the last 25 years however, thanks to pioneering works aiming to better integrate models with data [3, 53, 54], mathematical models of infectious diseases have crossed their traditional biomathematical boundaries to become central supporting tools for public health decisions, such as determining the duration of travel restrictions or of school closure during a pandemic event, or the fraction of newborn to be immunized for a vaccine-preventable infection, as measles. Some of these models are highly sophisticated both from the computational and data requirements\u2019 viewpoints [5, 39, 73]. In these models, the importance of human behavior is implicit in the acknowledged role of social or sexual contact patterns as the key determinant of the transmission of both close-contact infections, as influenza or measles, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as HIV/AIDS. In recent years there have been great advances in the understanding of contact patterns [59, 75, 108], which made available rich information about, for example, the average number of persons of different ages an individual encounters in a typical day. This information is allowing great improvements in model parameterization and validation. However, the point of behavioral epidemiology lies exactly here: though sophisticated, current models treat these contact patterns statically, as a universal constant, exactly as in the simple SIR model. This means that behavior is totally unaffected by the state of the disease, for example, individuals continue to contact each other however low or high might be the perceived risk of contracting the infection. As these static contact patterns refer to normal situations, the ensuing models are unlikely to apply under stressed conditions as those observed during a dangerous epidemic or a period of panic raised by a pandemic threat [38]. Similarly, models used to evaluate the impact of immunization programs treat vaccine uptake as a constant [3], totally unaffected by individuals\u2019 risk perceptions about the disease and the vaccine, and despite the fact that it is the degree of acceptance of the public that will ultimately determine the success of the program unless mandatory policies can be strictly enforced. Clearly, phenomena such as vaccine scares cannot be captured by treating vaccine coverage as a fixed, exogenously determined input parameter.",

We argue that a rich \u201chumus\u201d was supplied by the current scientific, cultural, and socio-demographical context of industrialized countries which has dramatically changed the relationship between humans and disease. In this context, individuals frantically demand \u201cpredictability\u201d during a pandemic event [38] or \u201crationally\u201d refuse a vaccine\u2014the invention that has protected so much human life in the last hundred years. In short, technology has turned us from victims of nature per se to victims of our own actions locked in a feedback loop with natural forces. This is why it is now that studying BE is important, and we expand on this in the following paragraphs. Until 1750 the millenary fight between man and disease\u2014the third horseman of the Apocalypse\u2014is the story of a long-lasting unperturbed ecological equilibrium. During this fight human behavioral responses to infectious disease threats always took place, as is documented by the great writers, from the Athens\u2019 \u201cplague\u201d described by Thucydides, to the Black Death whose visit to Florence was immortalized by Giovanni Boccaccio in the \u201cDecameron,\u201d to the seventeenth-century plague described by Daniel Defoe and Samuel Pepys, and two centuries later on by Alessandro Manzoni (Fig. 1). However, most these responses are reported by historians as taking place at the community level (e.g., enforcing quarantine of sick individuals and also of goods [97], or closing the city gates,1 and mass migrations\u2014especially by rich people\u2014toward the country2), so that individual actions, though reported, were usually perceived as minor and passive. Most of all these actions, collective or individual, were lacking any scientific basis.3 Most importantly, these actions were unable to mitigate plague epidemics or to perturb the ecological equilibrium between man and disease: infectious diseases continued to impose a major and intractable health burden on populations worldwide for several millenniums.\n\n",

These achievements have perturbed the equilibrium between humans and disease, yielding that epochal change in the casual composition of mortality from infectious (and nutritional) diseases to chronic degenerative ones known as the \u201cepidemiological transition\u201d [76, 96, 103]. The epidemiological transition has been a major determinant of the huge progress in survival and health in industrialized countries, where life expectancy increased from 25 to 30 years in preindustrial societies to more than 80 years in the  current period [69, 103], which in turn triggered fertility decline, the escape from Malthusian traps, and eventually, in a virtuous circle, sustained economic development [14, 45]. Further advances with vaccines, such as vaccines that protect against oncogenic viruses such as HBV and HPV, are making a reality out of previously utopian conceptions of life in a future world free from infectious diseases [22].",

In the simplest case this can be taken as a constant (e.g., as in [8]), though individuals\u2019 perceptions about a given vaccine are possibly affected by perceptions about other vaccines as well. On the other hand the perceived benefit of vaccination can be estimated by the perceived risk of suffering death (or serious morbidity) from the disease, which can in turn be estimated as the product of some measure of the current perceived risk of acquiring infection, i.e., the force of infection, and the conditional probability of death, as a consequence of infection. European data suggest that, due to improved nutrition and sanitation, the probability of death following infection from measles and other childhood infections fell off at least two orders of magnitude from 1860 to 1950 [34, 35], i.e., prior to when most immunization began. As for the risk of infection, the simple endemic SIR model with immunization at birth [3] suggests that for highly transmissible infection as measles, with a basic reproduction number about 15, a vaccine uptake of approximately 90 %, as was typical in many European countries during the last two decades, would create strong herd immunity by decreasing both the endemic prevalence and the risk of infection by about 30 times compared to the case of no vaccination. This straightforwardly yields the perception that the infection is no longer circulating. These numbers suggest that sanitation progress and mass immunization, two major factors underlying the changed relation between humans and their diseases, are now acting as \u201ckillers\u201d of the perceived rewards of immunization [33]. In simple words it is the vaccine\u2019s success in controlling infections that promotes \u201crational\u201d opposition, leading to declining vaccine coverage and potentially to infection reemergence.",

The first contribution is [91], where the effects of switching from high to low risk behavior on the epidemic threshold parameter were investigated by a two-group model with preferred mixing, subsequently extended in [66], and estimated in [99]. In [15] data on HIV/AIDS in San Francisco are used to provide a model-based estimate of the decline in at-risk behavior required to eliminate, even in presence of a vaccine, the infection. The first warning on the possibility that a protective vaccine increases epidemic severity by raising at-risk behavior is also put forth. Several papers have used simple models to investigate the static and dynamic effects of various forms of behavioral responses including prevalence-dependent recruitment into the at-risk population and reducing contact rates after screening or treatment [50, 56, 105, 106]. The effects of prevalence-dependent sexual mixing patterns were investigated in [58]. A first attempt to integrate optimal choices of sexual partners into HIV transmission models is [64]. These are pioneering works of an endless list.",

            "text": "In parallel to the explosion of studies on behavior change in relation to HIV/AIDS, the first studies on vaccinating behavior appeared. In a seminal epidemiological paper, Fine and Clarkson [40] compare the different perspectives of the individual and the public good toward immunization and supply the first formulation of the result that under voluntary vaccination, rational individuals\u2019 decisions would most often yield a lower vaccine uptake than is optimal for the community as a whole. This result remained essentially unnoticed to epidemiological modelers until recent times and was independently rediscovered later by economists as well, but in relation to the debate between free market and compulsory immunization formulated as a free-rider problem. Immunization against a communicable infection by a vaccine that protects against infection has a twofold protective effect: a direct one for those who are immunized and an indirect one for those who are not, due to the reduced circulation of the virus in the community which reduces the risk of acquiring infection for those non-immunized. Free-riding arises when some individuals take advantage of this indirect protection (herd immunity) created by those who choose to be vaccinated, to avoid immunization and its related costs. In [18] the conditions under which free-riding can be overcome without compulsory vaccination, through taxes or subsidies, are investigated, while [41] departs from the problem investigated in [18] and shows that in a special case of SI infections the market and the government optimal solutions may be identical. Geoffard and Philipson [48] use an SIR model for a childhood infection with vaccine uptake dependent upon infection prevalence as a measure of perceived risk of infection, as empirically supported by analyses in [80], to offer the first proof of the supposed impossibility of eliminating infection under voluntary vaccination. The simple argument is that a successful immunization program will strongly reduce infection prevalence and therefore also reduce the perceived risk of disease, thereby killing the vaccine demand. These works formed the \u201chumus\u201d for the current outbreak of BE studies, discussed in the next section.",

This game captures many of the basic features of mechanistic approaches to behavioral epidemiology modeling. We explain the game and its Nash equilibrium intuitively as follows. The game is a population game where individuals play against the outcome of the average behavior of the population. Individuals can either vaccinate or not vaccinate. The payoff to vaccinate is \u2212 r\nv, where r\nv is the vaccine cost, i.e., the perceived probability of complications due to vaccine (the payoff is negative because maximizing payoff is the same as minimizing adverse health impacts). The parameter r\nv could equally well be interpreted as being the financial costs plus monetized health costs due to complications.

Other answers to this question will appear in the following pages, and these directions by no means exhaust how the field can be further developed. Incorporating greater realism in transmission processes should come easily to the mathematical epidemiologists; however, incorporating greater realism into models of vaccinating behavior will require closer collaboration with psychologists, sociologists, epidemiologists, and economists.",
