This calculator also does not differentiate usage at various healthcare provider (HCP) and patient capacities. Vital factors that affect PPE supplies, namely decontamination, are not considered in the CDC PPE burn rate calculator. We designed a sampling approach to steward our current PPE supply, and we developed an institutional burn rate calculator to project usage patterns at various patient and/or provider volumes.",

We sampled continuously from weekdays to weekends to capture multiple use patterns. We previously implemented patient safety officers (PSOs) on each unit caring for COVID-19 patients to monitor infection control practices (eg, donning and doffing of PPE under extended use and reuse policies). The PSOs completed a survey of all providers present on the unit on the day and night shifts. This survey collected the following information: provider role, number of patients under the HCP care, number of COVID-19/person under investigation (PUI) patients under HCP care, number of contacts with COVID-19/ PUI patients, number of patients for which the HCP uses an N95 mask, number of N95 masks used during a shift, number of N95 masks sent for decontamination, number of N95 masks disposed during a shift, number of gowns used during a shift, number of gowns disposed during a shift, number of disposable face shields used during a shift, number of disposable face shields disposed during a shift, number of disposable eye protection measures worn during a shift, number of disposable eye protection measures disposed during a shift, and number of aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) for which the HCP participated for a COVID-19/PUI patient. Once sampling was completed, we were able to develop our calculator.",

Next, we determined the number of N95s used by role per shift by dividing the total N95s used by the total number of providers. Using the average number of providers by role (per shift) and the total N95s used by role (per shift), we estimated the N95 use rate by role per shift. We then aggregated the estimated N95 use rate by provider role per shift to determine the estimated total N95 use rate per shift. To calculate the burn rate, we determined the disinfection rate of N95 masks by HCP role per shift. The disinfection rate equals the total number of masks disinfected divided by the total N95s used by role per shift. This disinfection rate is then used as a constant to estimate the number of masks that are disinfected by HCP role per shift based on the estimated masks used by role per shift. The N95 burn rate is then calculated by subtracting the estimated number of N95s disinfected by HCP role per shift from the estimated N95 use rate by role per shift. From the sampled data, we also incorporated a functionality to determine the impact of proportionate changes in COVID-19/PUI patient volumes on N95 utilization.",

We assumed that our data collection helped us establish a baseline for the number of HCPs (and roles) that would interact with our COVID-19/PUI patients and that this level of care (ie, HCP-to-patient ratio) would be maintained as our volumes fluctuate (such that HCP staffing is directly proportional to patient volume). For example, if 5 nurses are staffed per shift to treat 10 COVID-19/PUI patients, 50 nurses would be staffed per shift for 100 COVID/PUI patients and the N95 use and burn rates would proportionally increase as well. Lastly, our calculator does not capture changes in N95 disinfection and N95 use rates, which can be subject to change.",

We also determined our N95 use rate, which informed future planning to optimize our inventory.
