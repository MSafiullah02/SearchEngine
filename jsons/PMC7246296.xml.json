We agree that our risk adjustment is imperfect, as is the case for all models that require significant underlying assumptions. For this reason, we proactively included a directed acyclic graph to lay out the assumptions made in our strategy. In so doing, we allow for (and welcome) the thoughtful discussion on limitations to our strategy, such as raised by de Grooth and colleagues.",

There is a growing body of evidence showing that acute lung injury can amplify renal injury [3]. The interplay between renal and lung injury is likely bidirectional and potentially mediated through inflammation [4, 5]. Others have shown that multisystem organ failure can be propagated by ventilator-induced lung injury [6]. Not knowing with precision the proportion of mortality caused by other acute organ failures lies on the causal path between ARDS and mortality versus serves as a confounder makes adjustment for these variables challenging. Excluding other organ failures from the model may inflate our estimate, though we note that the APACHE and SAPS scores do incorporate acute organ failures. Fully adjusting for non-pulmonary organ failures, however, would inappropriately attenuate or fully obscure the effects of ARDS on mortality.",

However, our primary conclusions still hold. One, any absolute changes in mortality by fully treating or preventing ARDS would still be relatively low. Two, trials designed to detect differences in ARDS mortality would need to be quite large. We did not provide specific numbers given limitations in the precision of our estimate. Three, trial design and efficiency could be improved by focusing enrollment on patients with severe ARDS. While the authors provide calculations showing how a trial size would differ substantially if the true value of ARDS-specific risk is half our estimate, there is no empiric data on which to base the degree of overestimation.",
