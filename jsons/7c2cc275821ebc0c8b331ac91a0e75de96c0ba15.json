            "text": "Introduction: Several studies have shown an increased intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery in HIV patients suggesting that this condition may favour atherosclerosis. It is unknown, however, whether this is typical of HIV per se or it is due to the adverse metabolic effects of antiretroviral treatment and specifically of protease inhibitors, possibly through alterations of metabolic variables. Aim: To measure common carotid intima-media thickness by a standard echocolorDoppler in HIV patients with and without protease inhibitors treatment, and characterize carotid wall composition by a dedicated software (HP technologies) based on the integrated backscatter analysis (IBS) of the native signals from the wall tissues, marker of fibrosis. Methods: We studied 44 HIV patients (38 males) with a mean age 45.9 -8.4 years (mean -SD) and a mean duration of the disease of 47.7 -33.2 months. Results: All patients were normotensive and had no history or evidence of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Their total cholesterol was 161.3 -46.3 mg dL and serum triglycerides value was 165.7 -117.0 mg dL. The average IMT was 0.64 -0.22 mm (RCCA) and 0.68 -0.26 mm (LCCA) which was similar to the value of age, sex and blood pressure matched controls. There was no significant difference between the IMT value in HIV patients treated (n = 29) or not treated (n = 15) with protease inhibitors. In HIV patients there was a significant correlation between the duration of the disease and the IMT value (r = 0.36, p < 0.01). Also carotid artery wall composition evaluated by IBS significantly correlated with the duration of the disease (r = 0.29, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study shows in patients with HIV a relationship between carotid artery IMT and IBS and the duration of the disease, even in the absence of a pathological increase of the IMT. This correlation suggests an association between the disease and wall structural abnormalities, in term of fibrosis, independently from the type of the antiretroviral therapy. Thus, the increased cardiovascular mortality in HIV patients may be explained by arterial structural changes favouring atherosclerosis.",

Male mice received vehicle or Ang II (400 ng kg min, s.c.) -SC-560 (COX-1 inhibitor, 10 mg Kg day i.p.) or celecoxib (cele, COX-2 inhibitor, 400 mg Kg day, food) (2 weeks, n = 7 each). Mesenteric vessels, studied on pressurized myograph, were exposed to intraluminal pressures (3-140 mmHg). Media thickness and lumen diameter were measured to determine mechanical properties. Collagen type I was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results: Systolic blood pressure (SBP), increased by Ang II, was unmodified by COX-1 or COX-2 treatment (table). Media lumen ratio (M L) and media cross-sectional area (CSA), increased by Ang II, were partially reduced by COX-1 and not modified by COX-2 inhibition (table). Ang IItreated group showed stiffer vessels, with leftward shift of the stress-strain relationship and a raised slope of the incremental elastic modulus-stress relationship as compared to controls (p < 0.01). This was attenuated (p < 0.05) by COX-1 inhibitor and unchanged by COX-2 blockade. The enhanced collagen deposition induced by Ang II was prevented by COX-1 and only slightly reduced by COX-2 inhibitor (table).",

LRP6 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and in rat carotid arteries but it is unknown whether it is expressed in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques and if a common 1062V LRP6 variant with reduced function can be related to carotid artery atherosclerosis (CAA) in hypertensive patients. Aim: This study verified the LRP6 gene expression in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques analyzing also the relationship between LRP6 variants and CAA in hypertensive patients. Methods: Human carotid plaque samples were obtained from 24 hypertensive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for carotid artery stenosis \u202170% of the lumen. Expression was evaluated by Real Time PCR. Electronic records of 334 hypertensive patients (<65 years-old) who underwent carotid artery ultrasonography were retrospectively reviewed: presence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, glomerular filtration rate, and smoking habit was evaluated. CAA was defined by the presence of atherosclerotic plaques (focal intima-media thickness \u20211.3 mm). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the independent effect of 1062V allele. Results: LRP6 transcripts were present in carotid artery plaques. Significantly lower LRP6 expression levels (p < 0.0001) were present in 1062V carriers compared with I1062I homozygous subjects. In the association study, no difference was observed between genotypes in clinic variables except for a slightly higher fasting glucose in 1062V carriers. The 1062V LRP6 variant was an independent risk factor for CAA in both unadjusted (OR 2.08, 95%CI 1.27, 3.41, p = 0.003) and adjusted models (OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.09, 3.39, p = 0.02). Conclusions: LRP6 1062 V variant is strongly linked to carotid artery atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients beyond the role of established risk factors for atherosclerosis. Different LRP6 expression levels in human atherosclerotic plaques in vivo suggest that LRP6 may have a key functional role in the plaque-development process.",

Aim: To investigate the relationships between IMT and markers of prothrombotic and proinflammatory state in primary hypertension. Methods: Two-hundred-and-three consecutive patients (age 56 -12 years; M, 111; F, 92) were evaluated with carotid scan and blood was collected to measure plasma fibrinogen, fibrin D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, and homocysteine levels, serum lipoprotein(a), CRP, HOMA index, and the glucose and insulin response to an oral glucose load. Results: Patients with a IMT above the median for the distribution (700 \u0131`m) were older (61 -9 vs. 51 -11 y; p < 0.001), had greater BMI (28.7 -4.5 vs. 27.5 -4.1 Kg 2 p = 0.040), greater systolic and differential blood pressure (respectively 149 -20 vs 142 -15 mmHg; p = 0.005 and 61 -14 vs. 52 -9 mmHg; p<0.001), longer duration of hypertension (13 -11 vs. 10 -8 y; p = 0.011), and greater prevalence of coronary artery (13% vs. 1%; p = 0.002) and cerebrovascular disease (5% vs 0%; p = 0.042) than patients with a IMT below the median. Regression analysis showed a direct relationship of IMT with age (r = 0.543; p < 0.001), waist circumference (r = 0.166; p = 0.013), systolic and differential blood pressure (respectively, r = 0.187; p = 0.008 and r = 0.358; p < 0.001), duration of hypertension (r = 0.284; p = 0.004), fibrinogen (r = 0.289; p = 0.002), D-dimer (r = 0.403; p < 0.001), CRP (r = 0.143; p = 0.041), and the glycemic response to the oral glucose load (r = 0.255; p = 0.001). At multivariate analysis, only age and D-dimer were independently related with IMT. Conclusions: These data show that an elevated plasma D-dimer is associated with the presence of an increased IMT and may contribute to development of carotid artery disease.",

Conclusions: Untreated HT show a peculiar expression pattern of MMP TIMP and inflammatory molecules in ADP: MMP2, TIMP1, TIMP2 and TGFb expression and act are markedly reduced, while PAI1 and IL6 expression are increased, as reflected by plasma levels.

All devices record BP using the oscillometric method with a BP range of 30-260 mmHg and heart rate range of 40-199 beats min. Among the three devices, the PIC-indolor Comfort check uses a pre-formed cuff designed to improve the compliance of the patient, it is easier to be wrapped around the arm because of a special preformed shape. Methods: The International validation Protocol is divided into 2 phases: the phase one (15 subjects and 45 pairs of BP measurements) and the phase 2 (18 supplementary subjects and 54 pairs of BP measurements) making a total number of 33 subjects (99 pairs of BP measurements) on which the final validation is performed. The same methodology was applied for the 3 studies.

Proper assessment of this phenomenon may however be prevented by the fact that, at high altitude-induced low barometric pressure, some BP measuring devices may become inaccurate. Aim: To cross-check the values provided by three different types of BP measuring devices at high and very high altitude, taking the mercury manometer as the standard reference. Methods: In 43 healthy, normotensive volunteers (age 39.9 -10, 29 M, 14 F) participating in the HIGHCARE2008 project, duplicate BP measurements were obtained in random order with mercury (MER), aneroid (ANE) and the validated oscillometric Microlife BP A100 Plus device (OSC) at Namche Bazaar (NB, 3400 m a.s.l.) and at Mt. Everest Base Camp (BC, 5400 m a.s.l.), after demonstration that, at sea level, no significant BP difference could be observed between MER and either ANE or OSC. Results: At NB mean BP measured by MER, ANE and OSC device was, respectively: 124. 1 -13.4, 121.1 -11.5 and 124.4 -16. 2 mmHg for systolic and 82. 6 -10.7, 80.7 -9.3 and 80.8 -12.6 mmHg for diastolic BP (all differences NS). At BC it was 128. 1 -11.6, 123.2 -12.6 and 128.5 -11.4 mmHg for systolic (p < 0.001 for ANE vs. both MER and OSC) and 85. 7 -9.3, 81.7 -10.8 and 84.4 -9.6 mmHg for diastolic BP (p < 0.001 for ANE vs MER). Correlation coefficients (r) between BP measured by MER device and the other two devices as well as percentages of ANE and OSC BP values falling within -5 mmHg of BP measured with mercury device are shown in the table.",

Results: In one month there were enrolled 120 patients with arterial hypertension, 51% Men and 49% Women, with an average age of 62 years: it was collected all the data concerning on the habits of life, and the associated risk factors, it was measured the clinic BP and administered questionnaires about quality of life and self-measurement methods. Then, in random they were divided into 2 groups of 60 patients: control (53% women and 47% men, 60-year average) and experimental (46% women and 54% men, 63-year average). Only the experimental group was given training, once a month, with focus groups made of workshop lesson. After 3 months all the 120 patients were subjected to a post-test. The control group has not changed its life style, 42% has gone to the doctor because of pressure increases, has measured the BP once a month and has obtained 40% of therapeutic change, although 60% consider hypertension a serious illness. While the experimental group has correctly measured the BP once a week, with 3 measurements in each session, has not produced pharmacological shifts, 40% had stopped smoking, 39% performed regular physical activity, 48% takes more vegetables and less sugar, 26% had decreased by 7 kg his body weight and has not even once gone to his doctor because of pressure increases. Finally all patients proved to be willing to continue this type of educational strategy. Conclusions: Our pilot study aimed at demonstrating how the model of 3 actors integrated assistance necessarily takes to better empowerment of health education, besides the figure of the Doctor, it's the Nurse who mainly manages the training and education of the patient, who, in turn, becomes 'expert' in managing on his own his health, obtaining a proper certification. All this could lead to an improvement in the system efficiency including economic and health side for an appropriate use of medications and operations. Introduction: High blood pressure (BP) prevalence is increasing in low resource settings (LRS) like Africa, while BP monitoring and treatment remain poor. A major problem in LRS is unavailability of reliable, durable and affordable BP measuring devices, in particular facing withdrawal of mercury sphygmomanometers (M). A WHO expert committee defined the features of BP measuring devices suitable to LRS. One device (OMRON M1 Plus, OM1) fulfilling these criteria (including low cost) was recently validated using the ESH Protocol. Aim: To assess the usability, acceptability and accuracy of OM1 under field conditions in LRS.",

Introduction: The Tuscan Region approved, in 2008, an experimental model of 'See and Treat' in First Aid in the field of health emergency which creates the basis for the reorganization of low priority codes care and which introduces nursing figures trained and experienced in the treatment of a number of diseases in order to reduce waiting times. The asymptomatic blood pressure increases, representing approximately 10% of access to emergency room have been included in the regional act as appropriate to the minor emergency treatment area See and Treat. Aim: To evaluate the applicability of this model on the treatment, from See and Treat area the doctor and the nurse figures, of asymptomatic pressure increases in a population of citizens who arrived at the emergency room. Methods: In 3 months, 284 patients have been (153 M and 131 M, with an average age of 64.5 years) who had 160 120 mmHg Blood Pressure (BP), and who have been divided in random into 2 groups: the group control treated by the doctor and the experimental group treated by the nurses in the same area of See and Treat. After a period of 10 minutes of relaxation, in all patients it was measured the clinic BP in a sitting position (3 measurements at a distance of 2 minutes), and it was personal and pharmacological case; no patient reported associated symptoms. Results: In the control group we obtained a reduction in average blood pressure to 148 90 mmHg in 62% of patients, while in the remaining 38% (54 patients) the values of PA were >160 120 mmHg. In the experimental group, instead 88% of patients had a reduction in average blood pressure to 144 84 mmHg, while only 12% (17 patients) did not present significant reduction.

Introduction: Aortic stiffness, a prognostically adverse early noninvasive marker of arteriosclerosis, is strongly affected by blood pressure (BP). Increasing evidence suggests a link between short-term BP variability and cardiovascular complications in hypertension, but the effects of BP variability on large-artery stiffness are understudied. Methods: 540 consecutive untreated patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (59% men, BP 151 94 -16 10 mmHg) underwent determination of carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), an accurate and reproducible index of aortic stiffness, by high-fidelity applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor), and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring with a validated oscillometric device (SpaceLabs 90207, 1 reading every 15 min for 24 hours). The standard deviation of daytime and night time systolic BP (SBP) was taken as a measure of short-term BP variability. Results: The standard deviation of daytime and night-time SBP (r = 0.18 0.18; both p < 0.001), but not of diastolic BP, showed a significant correlation with cfPWV. Since the standard deviation of daytime SBP showed a direct association with average daytime SBP (r = 0.26), subjects were ranked into sex-specific quartiles of the distribution of daytime SBP. For each quartile, the subjects with standard deviation of daytime (and night-time) SBP below or above the median were classified at low or high BP variability. cfPWV was 9.3 -2 and 9.8 -2 m s in the subjects at low and high daytime SBP variability (p = 0.02), and 9.3 -2 and 9.9 -2 m s in the subjects at low and high night-time SBP variability (p = 0.07). In a multivariate linear regression model, the standard deviation of daytime SBP was cfPWV was an independent predictor of cfPWV together with age, sex, average daytime SBP, and cigarette smoking. Conclusions: After taking into account the confounding effect of average BP, age and several other risk factors, BP variability assessed with noninvasive monitoring is independently related to aortic stiffness in hypertension. Introduction: Diabetes mellitus increases cardiovascular risk connected with hypertension; for this reason guidelines recommend tight blood pressure control in diabetic patients. We analyzed diabetic patients undergoing ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in order to evaluate their 24 hr BP control and variability in comparison with a non diabetic population. Methods: In our database of 6543 subjects undergoing ABPM (January 1998 to November 2008) we identified 1209 type 2 diabetic subjects according to the fact that they were treated with glucose lowering drugs (whether oral or insulin) and or the answer to the question ''are you diabetic?'' 136 patients receiving only insulin were not taken into account because the exact type of diabetes could not be correctly detailed. We evaluated the percentages of patients with a 24 hr BP <125 80 in relation to the number of antihypertensive drugs (from 0 to 5 or more); results were compared with a non diabetic population undergoing ABPM in the same period of time. We also considered the prevalence of the morning surge phenomenon (mean systolic blood pressure in the hour after awakening -minimum systolic pressure in the night), 24 hours blood pressure variability and the dipper non-dipper percentages.",

Prevalence of hypertension in a population of the extremely obese, even if relatively young, individuals is quite high (known + true + masked hypertensive patients): 63.8%. Conclusions: We maintain that ABPM is an extremely useful tool and must be always recommended in these patients in order to correctly identify the degree of hypertension. It proved helpful to evaluate a correct hypotensive therapy in order to reduce surgical and cardiovascular risk. Introduction: The most recent guidelines lay emphasis on the importance of maintaining adequate life style and regularly physical activity is one of the most important factors of cardiovascular prevention. However, the percentage of obese and sedentary subjects is increasing among general population in last years. We therefore assessed the attitude to perform physical activity in a period of 6 years in a group of residents tourists in Milan. Methods: From 2002 to 2008, once a year, we had evaluated the physical attitude, the degree of training, heart rate and life style of a group of 1995 people (mean age 50 -40 ys; 57% males and 43% females; BMI 23. 1 -4.2) attempting to climb the stairs (about 250 steps) toward the top of the Cathedral of Milan (average time 16'30'' -4'47'') . The subjects were assessed in baseline and after the climb by monitoring heart rate and oxygen saturation. We also collected data about lifestyle, risk factors and cardiovascular disease. Results: During the 6 years we found a reduction in the percentage of smoking people (18.8% vs 14.1%, ns) with a significant prevalence in women and an increase in people practicing regularly exercise (2 hours a week 56.8% vs 60.9%, ns). Conclusions: These studies may provide a useful model for public education and to assess the evolution of lifestyle in the general population in particular as regards the attitude to perform physical activity. (12.5% 4 M) were affected by nephrovascular IA and treated with revascularization; 5 (8.9% 3 M) were affected by nephrovascular. Removing the cause was effective for 16 patients out of 21 who suffered from OSAS, 3 out of 5 who were affected by suprarenal disease, 7 out of 7 with nephrovascular IA, 1 out of 5 with nephroparenchymal disease. Conclusions: The IAR spread is high and an early diagnosis can cut drugs expenditure, first aid and family doctor referrals and, most of all, severe organ damage. An extended debate is necessary to find out a quick and inexpensive diagnostic process.",

Methods: Body weight, height and blood pressure (BP) were measured in 5131 children (8. 2 -1.5 years, 51.8% males) . Underweight (UW), normal weight (NW), overweight (OW), and obese (OB) children were defined according to the International Obesity Task Force. In children with systolic (SBP) and or diastolic (DBP) blood pressure values obtained from a first measurement >90th percentile (according to the National High Blood Pressure Education Program) 3 consecutive blood pressure measurements were performed in a different occasion. The mean of the 3 blood pressure measurements defined blood pressure categories as follows: casual hypertensive patients (CH): SBP and DBP <90th; pre-hypertensive patients (PH): SBP and or DBP >90th and <95th; hypertensive patients (HY): SBP and or DBP >95th. Children with SBP and or DBP <90th at the first measurement were considered normotensives (NT). Results: UW children were 409 (8.0%), NW 3371 (65.6%), OW 1025 (20.0%) and OB 326 (6.4%). The distribution of BP categories according to body weight classes is shown in the table. The percentage of subjects with casual hypertension, pre-hypertension and hypertension progressively increased with the increase in body weight class. The multivariate analysis showed that body weight class was significantly associated to elevated BP categories adjusted for gender, height and age. The mean SBP and DBP z-scores of the 3 BP measurements of the children with SBP and or DBP >90th at the first measurement (casual hypertensive patients) were significantly greater than those obtained in normotensive children.",

Echocardiogram confirms itself as more sensible and specific compared with ECG in LVH detection. Fundus oculi doesn't provide additional information for the correct stratification of cardiovascular risk in our hypertensive patients. Introduction: The Hypertension Working Group of Cardarelli Hospital in Naples, Italy developed a therapeutic education project ''10 anni di vita in piu`'' (a life ten years longer) to reduce blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension through a change of their lifestyle. Methods: 336 patients were randomly assigned to Control group (163) and to Intervention group (173). Ten multiple choice questionnaire was developed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on lifestyle modification. Patients were given the questionnaire and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire, had BP measured, laboratory data collected, and drug therapy registered before educational intervention and 12 months later. Group I patients (mean age 56.7 -10.2, 46.2%, male) participated to 3 interactive educational sessions respectively 2, 4 and 9 months after the recruitment. Sessions were set in a way that patients could easily talk about what they were learning, write reflectively about it, relate it to past experiences, and apply it to their daily lives. What they learnt became a part of themselves. Group C patients (mean age 56. 4 -10.7, 47 .9%, male) received oral information and were followed-up at 2, 4 and 9 months after the recruitment to make both groups comparable. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 15.0. Results: After 12 months there was a significant reduction of BP for both groups (group I t = 0: SBP = 136.9 -18.3 DBP = 85.1 -9.1, t = 12 months SBP = 127. ; group C t = 0: SBP = 138.7 -12.0 DBP = 86.6 -5.9, t = 12 months SBP = 133.2 -9.7 DBP = 83.8 -6.1) (p < 0.001). In group I, 26.8% of patients reduced and 7.1% increased drug therapy while for 66.1% drug therapy remained unchanged. For group C 16.7% reduced and 33.3% increased drug therapy, while for 50% drug therapy remained unchanged. The reduction of BP values in group I was due to an increased adherence to recommendations given by physicians while in group C was especially due to an increase of drug therapy. As a consequence group I patients saved 3.15 euros per capita per month and group C patients spent 1.8 euros more per capita per month. We found a significant improvement of lifestyle modification after 12 months of follow-up concerning some aspects in both groups, while SF-36 showed better results for the majority of the items in group I. Conclusions: Our findings show that this approach is a powerful tool for reaching better blood pressure control and underline the essential role of patients involvement in the management of their care. Introduction: The Hypertension Working Group of Cardarelli Hospital, transferred from hospital to the community the therapeutic patient project ''10 anni di vita in piu`'' (a life ten years longer) whose objective was to reduce blood pressure (BP) through better adherence to the recommendations given by physicians. This transfer was possible thank to the collaboration of the Benevento's Order of Physicians, the Benevento's General Practitioners (GP) [Samnium Medica Cooperative, Ippocrate Cooperative, Medical 2000 Cooperative] and the Department of Metabolic Diseases of Rummo Hospital of Benevento. Methods: 11 GPs participated to the project. The educational intervention consisted of 3 interactive sessions with patients. Patients were given ten multiple choice questionnaire, developed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on lifestyle modification, together with the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire before educational intervention and 12 months later. Patients participated to the interactive sessions respectively 2, 4 and 9 months after the recruitment. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 15.0. Results: Two hundred eighty-nine patients were recruited; mean age was 62.8 -3.1, 54.5% of the sample was male. At the time of recruitment SBP was 137. . After 12 months there was a significant reduction of BPr (SBP = 134.4 -11.9 and DBP = 80.9 -6.9; p < 0.001). This reduction is associated with better adherence to recommendations given by the physicians. 20.7% of patients reduced drug therapy, 12.9% % increased drug therapy while for 66.4% drug therapy remained unchanged. We registered a total reduction on drugs expenditure of 2.3 euros per capita per month. The lifestyle questionnaire showed a positive trend towards a change of lifestyle. The SF-36 values showed slightly improved after 1 year. Data of control group are in progress. Conclusions: A better relationship between GPs and patients can make significantly contribute to the prevention of diseases, especially those with high social impact, to the modification of behaviour, to the improved use of drugs and health services and to reduce health costs.",

Bolondi Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy Introduction: Sorafenib, an antiangiogenetic and antiproliferative drug used to treat patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, was recently been approved for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment also. Major side-effects of this drug are fatigue, diarrhoea, anorexia, hand and foot skin reactions and arterial hypertension development, that might be related to its inhibitory effect on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptor. Aim: To establish the incidence of arterial hypertension in 45 patients receiving Sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma and to evaluate the best clinic management of treated subjects. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 45 subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma arisen on hepatic cirrhosis treated with Sorafenib 800 mg day (37 males, 8 females, mean age 69.8 years, range 48-88). According to guidelines, the diagnosis of arterial hypertension was defined as the threefold presence of arterial blood pressure >140 90 mmHg. Results: Nine of 45 patients (20%) developed arterial hypertension during Sorafenib treatment. Eight of them were hypertensive well controlled with antihypertensive drugs before Sorafenib therapy. In all patients hypertension occurred early in the course of treatment (two weeks). In 8 patients the dose of antihypertensive medication was increased and in 6 new antihypertensive drugs were added. In the remaining subject antihypertensive treatment was started. In 3 9 patients (33%) Sorafenib treatment was interrupted, considering also others side effects presentation. Conclusions: Arterial hypertension development is a frequent side-effect during Sorafenib treatment. Patients given Sorafenib need to be closely monitored, especially when they start therapy, to an early hypertension detection and an effective treatment, allowing prevention of cardiovascular complications. In case of persistent hypertension, additionally to antihypertensive treatment, temporary or permanent Sorafenib discontinuation should be considered. Introduction: The presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can influence the choice of antihypertensive therapy. An association between high body mass index (BMI) and GERD has been proposed but is still unclear the relationship between the severity of obesity and the prevalence or gravity of esophagitis. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of erosive GERD in female obese subjects as compared with normal weight women with or without GERD symptoms. Methods: 145 obese women (Group A) scheduled for bariatric surgery, 146 women with GERD symptoms (Group B) and 146 women with various gastrointestinal presentations but no GERD symptoms were submitted to esophago-gastric endoscopy. Erosive reflux disease was diagnosed according to the Los Angeles Classification of esophagitis. There were among the three groups no differences in coffee, alcohol consumption and smoke habits. All data were analysed by logistical regression. Results: In the Group A (age 41.3 -11.6 years) mean BMI was 43.8 -6.8, in Group B (age 54.4 -14.8 years) mean BMI was 24.9 -2.7, in Group C (age 46.4 -17 years) mean BMI was 23.4 -3.5. The prevalence of esophagitis was significantly higher in Group A (43%) as compared with Group B (23.3%) and Group C (16.4%). Conclusions: Obese women with severe obesity, without obvious symptoms of GERD, showed a higher risk for erosive reflux disease than normal weight women GERD related symptoms and normal weight women without superior gastrointestinal tract symptoms. These findings indicate that the choice of antihypertensive therapy in obese women should take into account the high prevalence of GERD. Introduction: Limited information is available on the awareness and on the therapeutic control of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, when these pathological conditions are present simultaneously in the same patient.

Results: 38503 subjects 60 -13.8 (mean -SD) years old were recruited. 11.2% had history of cardiac or cerebrovascular event, while 21.2% were current smokers. Obese and overweight patients were 43.6% and 21% respectively. 33.1% of the population was affected by hypertension, of which 1 3 showed a satisfactory blood pressure profile at the time of the visit, while 2 3 did not. 27.5% of patients without history of hypertension showed blood pressure values >140 90 mmHg, due either to alarm reaction or to new onset hypertension. Of these, 53.3% had mild, 31.8% moderate and 9.9% severe hypertension. 8.5% had a history of diabetes, of which 1 3 had normal and 2 3 uncontrolled glycaemic values (cut-off 100 mg dL). Patients without a history of diabetes with serum glucose >100 mg dL were 28.8%, of which 81.9% was classified as pre-diabetes and 18.1% as new onset diabetes. 24.9% had history of hypercholesterolaemia, of which 1 3 was controlled by treatment. 39.5% of subjects with no history of dyslipidemia showed total cholesterol values >180 mg dL and were classified as new onset dyslipidemia. Total cardiovascular risk profile (SCORE) resulted high in 12.6%, moderate in 64.5% and low in 22.9% of the population. Conclusions: In a population characterized by a high-moderate CV risk profile, the awareness of the conditions of diabetes or hypercholesterolaemia is superior than the awareness of hypertension. In patients under treatment, however, cardiometabolic control results were not adequate. Acknowledgment: This study was supported by an Educational Grant from Bayer, Italy. Introduction: Inactivity and a reduced physical activity are causes of well known cardiovascular risks. The principal guidelines for prevention from cardiovascular diseases advise a moderate physical activity, equal to walks of 30-60 minutes at fast pace, for most days; these recommendations derive for studies which have demonstrated how advantages in terms of risks reduction are already evident also with low levels of physical activity. Other studies have documented how, in order to have positive effects, it is not necessary for the physical activity to be structured nor continuative. Less known are the levels of basic physical activity of patients to whom we recommend this type of activity in terms of prevention. Aim: To determine the physical activity of patients suffering from hypertension, of middle age, resident in a city, through the use of a pedometer (for a week), together with data collected through questionnaires aimed at establish the occasional physical activity in various months of the year and that in the past. Methods: 50 patients with hypertension were examined (16 females and 34 males) not selected: with an average age of 51 years old (ranging from 45 to 55 years). Results: 80% of the patients resulted already under treatment for hypertension at the time of visit and the medical PA at the time of visit was 132 82 mmHg. Approximately 30% of the patients presented signs for the metabolic syndrome. The 90% of patients declared a precedent physical activity and only in one quarter of the cases physical activity at professional level. As far as hours dedicated to physical activities in the last 12 months were concerned, 75% of the patients declared to dedicate less than 2 hours weekly. On the basis of data provided from the pedometer, approximately 10% of the patients could be classified as sedentary (less than 5000 steps day); 30% presented a low level of activity (between 5000 and 7500 steps day); 45% showed signs of a discreet physical activity (from 7500 to 10000 steps day) while only 15% resulted active or very active (more than 10000 steps day). Conclusions: Since this latter limit is indicated in some guidelines as the minimal level of physical activity which protects from risks, our research confirms that the basic physical activity of a urban population is significantly low and the consequential benefit of an increase of the physical activity, in most cases. Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases are an important health problem. In particular, arterial hypertension stand out with an estimated prevalence around 20-30% of the population over 18 years. A serious complication of arterial hypertension are hypertensive crises, characterized by a rapid, inappropriate, strong and often symptomatic elevation in blood pressure levels, with or without the risk of rapid deterioration of target organs, (TOD), which may represent an immediate or potential life threat. A hypertensive crisis may be manifested as a hypertensive emergency or urgency. The real epidemiologic extent of the hypertensive emergency and urgency has been not clearly assessed. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of hypertensive crisis (emergency, urgency), of their clinic presentation and of the type of organ damage. Methods: We collected the case files of all the patients admitted to the Emergency Department of the 9 centers involved in the Study between the first of January and 31 December 2008. Hypertensive crisis was defined as systolic blood pressure >220 and diastolic >120 mmHg. Hypertensive urgency was defined as symptomatic increase of blood pressure in absence of TOD; hypertensive emergency was defined as symptomatic increase of blood pressure in presence of acute or progressive TOD. Results: A total of 192294 clinic files, of the first six months, were screened. Prevalence of hypertensive crisis was 0.43% (804 cases). The hypertensive emergencies were 37.6% and urgencies were 62.4%. 12% of the patients was unaware of their hypertension. Patients with hypertensive emergencies were more frequently male (66.3%; p < 0.002), older (60.1 -14.2 years, p < 0.001) and with higher diastolic blood pressure (128.1 -12 vs 125.6 -14 mmHg, p < 0.05) compared with patients with hypertensive urgencies. The emergencies clinic presentation was more frequently ischemic stroke and pulmonary oedema. Conclusions: Hypertensive crisis represent the 0.43% of all the Emergency Department admission in this wide population. Hypertensive urgencies were more frequent than emergencies. Pulmonary oedema and ischemic stroke were the more frequent TOD clinic presentation of the hypertensive emergencies. 19-97 years), randomly selected, from the cohort of the population-based longitudinal Brisighella Heart Study (BHS; 1972 -2008 . We measured blood pressure (BP), weight (W), height (H), waist and hip circumference (WC, HC); then, we calculated waist to hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), BMI to WHR ratio (BMI WHR), waist to height ratio (WHtR) and a new index waist circumference for weight to height ratio (WCW H). Anthropometric indices were grouped into quintiles and we calculated, with the chi-quadrate test, the association with hypertension, with the cut-off at 25 for BMI and at the third quintile for the other parameters. Hypertension was defined by a blood pressure measurement \u2021140 90 mmHg or the use of blood pressure lowering drugs. All data were adjusted for age, cholesterolaemia and diabetes. Results: All anthropometric parameters (BMI, BMI WHR, WHtR, WCW H) have a predict power to develop hypertension in all the subjects of 30-64 years and in the female >64 years; for male >64 years there is a significant correlation only between BMI WHR and hypertension (table).",

Introduction: The association of sodium intake and adverse cardiovascular outcomes have long been recognised, with reduction in salt intake now considered a major public health intervention. The population benefits of salt reduction have been extrapolated by those expected through its blood pressure lowering effect. Aim: To assess whether the population longitudinal evidence supports the presence of a relationship between levels of salt intake and both stroke and cardiovascular outcomes, and to obtain an estimate of the risk. Methods: We performed a systematic search of publications using MEDLINE , EMBASE (from 1980), AMED, CINHAL, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library and manual searches without language restrictions and, when necessary, authors were contacted. Criteria for inclusion were: population studies with assessment of salt intake as baseline exposure and either stroke or total CVD determined prospectively as outcome. For each study several characteristics were recorded, relative risks and 95% C.I. were extracted and pooled using a random effect model, weighting for the inverse of the variance. Sensitivity analysis was performed, heterogeneity and publication bias were also assessed. Results: Overall, 11 studies were identified providing 16 cohort samples. They included 156 697 male and female participants (follow-up range 3.5-19 years), 5 183 stroke and 4 129 CVD events. Salt intake was assed by 24-hour dietary recall (n = 3), FFQ (n = 3), urine excretion (n = 4) and questionnaire (n = 1). In the pooled analysis, higher salt intake was associated with greater risk of stroke (RR: 1.26; 95% CI 1.07, 1.48; p = 0.004) and CVD (1.20; 0.95, 1.50; p = 0.12) , with no evidence of publication bias but significant heterogeneity between studies (p < 0.001 for both endpoints). For stroke the pooled estimate did not vary substantially with the exclusion of individual studies. However, for CVD the exclusion of a single outlier led to a pooled estimate of 1.28 (1.03-1.58); p < 0.01. Conclusions: High salt intake is associated with significantly greater risk of both stroke and total CVD. These results support worldwide recommendations for a population reduction in salt intake to prevent cardio and cerebrovascular disease. Introduction: Obesity was shown to be associated with increased risk of stroke in most but not all epidemiological studies, and the extent of the association with the various types of stroke remains uncertain. Aim: To determine whether a graded association occurs between excess body weight and the incidence of stroke and its subtypes by performing a meta-analysis of the cohort studies available. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and bibliographies of retrieved articles. Studies were included if their follow-up observation was at least 5 years and if they reported the number of individuals exposed and the corresponding number of events in each weight category. We used a random effect model and a funnel plot and Egger's test with trim-andfill procedure, when necessary. ; 1972-2009 ) is a prospective, longitudinal epidemiological study with four years follow up. For this study, we take the level of 160 mg dL such as cut-off for n-HDL-c and we selected 1099 adult subjects representative of the Brisighella population, consecutively visited during the BHS surveys 1988-1992, with no important modification of their lipid profile. Results: Among the 1099 subjects that didn't change their lipid profile during the follow up, 43% had n-hdl-c levels <160 mg dL (41% males, 45.1% women) and 57% had n-HDL-c levels >160 mg dL (59% males, 54.9% females). In subgroup that developed hypertension during the follow up there is an higher prevalence of subjects high levels of n-HDL-C (16.5% of subjects with n-HDL-C >160 mg dL vs 6.2% of subjects with n-HDL <160 mg dL, p < 0.001). After adjusting for BMI, glycaemia, triglycerides and HDL-C plasma levels we divided our population in subgroups for sex and age and we found an higher prevalence of new cases of hypertension in subjects <65 years old (males: 11.5% for subjects with n-HDL-C level >160 mg dL vs. 1% subjects with n-HDL-C level <160 mg dL, p = 0.006; females: 12.5% for subjects with n-HDL-C level >160 mg dL vs 2.2% n-HDL-C level <160 mg dL, p = 0.007).",

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), apart from accurate BP measurements, can give useful information on some parameters considered important in the evaluation of the total cardiovascular risk. Differences in the prevalence of these parameters could be an important factor in this increased cardiovascular risk. Aim: We analyzed diabetic subjects type 2 undergoing ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in order to evaluate their 24-hour BP profile and BP variability. Methods: Data regarding 1209 diabetic (type 2) subjects undergoing ABPM (from January 1998 to November 2008) at our institution were analyzed. Normotension was defined as a mean 24 BP <125 80 while hypertension as a mean 24 BP >125 80. We considered as non-dippers subjects with mean night systolic pressure values above 90% of day values. Systolic blood pressure variability was expressed as the standard deviation of the 24 hr systolic pressure. Morning surge phenomenon (MS) was also calculated considering the mean systolic blood pressure in the two hours after awakening -minimum systolic pressure in the night. The Aim: To evaluate similarities and differences in the global CV risk management in patients included in the EFFECTUS study, stratified in different macro-areas (north, middle and south) throughout the Italian territory. Methods: The EFFECTUS study involved physicians who agreed to participate in an educational project, aimed at implementing the knowledge and management of global CV risk. Physicians were asked to report in a dedicated case report form data already available in their medical records from 10 consecutive adult outpatients, during the month of May 2006. Data collection included patients' medical history, drug treatment, physical examination, laboratory results or diagnostic tests.

Through CIRS we detected a stronger severity in associating cognitive decline to: stroke, Parkinson disease, cardiovascular disease and depression. In detail we detected depression in 32.4% elderly hypertensive subjects, prevalently in women (p < 0.05). In male elderly hypertensive and depressed patients we detected a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk compared to the non-depressed ones (12.40% vs 7.3%, p < 0.05). In female elderly depressed subjects there was a slighter difference. Conclusions: Prevalence of cognitive impairment was 28.7% in elderly hypertensive patients. If we consider that just 39.6% had controlled BP we assessed that an appropriate BP control was related to a higher MMSE score. Cognitive impairment was strongly related to older age and geriatric diseases. Introduction: The epidemic of overweight is increasing prevalence of diabetes (DM) in adolescents and young adults. Aim: To evaluate in a population-based study the early metabolic and cardiovascular impact of DM in young adults. Methods: We analyzed anthropometric, metabolic and hemodynamic characteristics, left ventricular (LV) geometry and function (by Doppler-echocardiography) in 1644, 14-to-39 year old participants (57% female, mean age 26 -8 years) to the 4th Strong Heart Study (SHS) examination, 173 (11%) of whom had DM. Comparison between groups was obtained by ANCOVA, adjusting for blood pressure (BP), age, gender and BMI. Results: Participants with DM were more often obese (80% vs 51%), older (age 32 -6 vs 26 -8 years), and hypertensive (44% vs 14%) and had more dyslipidemia (84% vs 54%) and proteinuria (41% vs 8%; all p < 0.0001) than non diabetic participants (ND). After adjustment for major covariates, participants with DM had higher LV relative wall thickness (0.31 vs 0.30, p = 0.007), higher cardiac output (5.7 vs 5.2 L min p < 0.0001), lower stress-corrected midwall shortening (99 vs 101%, p = 0.01); higher LV elastance (mean arterial BP LV end-systolic volume: 2.00 vs 1.89 mmHg mL, p = 0.01), arterial elastance (mean BP stroke volume: 1.19 vs 1.14 mmHg mL beat, p = 0.03) central pulse pressure (39.4 vs 37.8 mmHg, p < 0.0001), with lower total peripheral resistance (1311 vs 1412 dynes sec cm 5 , p < 0.0001). Participants with DM also exhibited diastolic dysfunction with higher transmitral A velocity, longer isovolumic relaxation time and lower transmitral E A ratio than ND participants (all <0.001), without significant differences for other echocardiographic variables. Conclusions: Among adolescent and young adult of the SHS, with high prevalence of obesity and arterial hypertension, DM is associated with early metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities, characterized by alterations of vascular-ventricular coupling and unfavorable LV geometric modifications.",

            "text": "Conclusions: This study shows the importance of risk stratification for elderly people affected by hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. The prevalence of microalbuminuria is higher in elderly subjects with hypertension and diabetes mellitus mostly when there is a lesser control of blood pressure. In the same patients the prevalence of cardiovascular risk, ischemic cardiopathy and comorbidity is higher. Whether and to what extent the reported association has a functional counterpart as far as adrenergic function is concerned is unknown. Methods: In 78 patients with metabolic syndrome (MS, NCEP ATPIII criteria) aged 57.4 -1.2 years (mean -SEM, 64 males, 14 females), we measured, along with routine metabolic and anthropometric parameters useful for MS diagnosis), beat-to-beat blood pressure (Finapres), heart rate (HR, EKG), plasma norepinephrine (NE, venous sample, HPLC assay) and efferent postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA, microneurography, peroneal nerve) during a 30 min resting period. Measurements also included genotype rs17055869ADRA1A (Illumina BeadChip platform) allele frequency analysis. Results: According to the behaviour of the adrenergic function, MS patients were subdivided in 2 groups, one with normal values of the adrenergic function (n = 8, HR:72.3 -1.9 beats min, NE: 204.2 -16 pg mL and MSNA:41.2 -2.9 bursts 100 heart beats) and the other one with a marked cardiovascular adrenergic overdrive (n = 70, HR: 78.1 -1.6 beats min, NE: 407.5 -22 pg mL and MSNA: 60.8 -2.0 bursts 100 heart beats, p < 0.01 vs MS with normal adrenergic function). All MS patients with normal adrenergic function displayed a C C genotype, with no presence of C T or T T. In contrast MS patients with sympathetic overactivity displayed a C C, C T or T T genotype frequency in 55, 14 and 1 respectively. The homozygotic and heterozygotic status of the T allele was more represented in people with a sustained sympathetic activation, i.e. with all 3 the above mentioned adrenergic markers increased. MS patients with C T or T T genotype did not differ from the C C genotype group for age, gender, body mass index, waist circumference, waist hip ratio, blood pressure, HOMA index or leptin values. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that in MS sympathetic activation shows a trend towards the presence of CT or T allele of rs17055869ADRA1A. These preliminary data, which require to be confirmed in a larger MS population sample given the low frequency of T allele in the population, may suggest that in MS ADRA1A gene may be linked, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to a functional status of marked sympathetic overdrive. 5, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] are lipid mediator with vasodilator properties and in some vascular act as endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). Moreover, these compounds have diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (gene name EPHX2) is responsible for metabolism of EETs to their correspondent inactive diols. Two functional polymorphisms of the EPHX2 gene, K55R and R287Q, showed respectively augmented and diminished metabolic activity in vitro and were associated with coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke in previous studies. Aim: To evaluate the effect of these polymorphisms on blood pressure (BP) levels, hypertension prevalence, and risk of incident cardiovascular events in more than 6000 middle-aged Swedes. Methods: The polymorphisms were genotyped in the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmo\u00a8Diet and Cancer Study. The incidence of cardiovascular events (coronary events, n = 274; ischemic stroke, n = 197) was monitored over 10 years of follow-up. The analysis of BP levels was performed twice: either excluding or including subjects under antihypertensive treatment. Results: In the whole population, both polymorphisms had no effect on the studied parameters but a positive interaction between male and K55R was evident: male, but not female, EPHX2 gene R55R homozygotes had significantly higher crude and adjusted systolic BP and higher hypertension prevalence with respect to K-carriers. Kaplan-Meier curves showed higher incidence of ischemic strokes in male R55R homozygotes with respect to K-carriers (p = 0.015 by log rank test). After adjustment for major cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratio for incident ischemic stroke in male R55R homozygotes remained significantly higher (hazard ratio: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.2, 19.9) even when baseline BP levels and hypertension prevalence were included in the Cox proportional hazard model. These polymorphisms were not associated with other metabolic syndrome related phenotypes. Conclusions: A common K55R polymorphism of the EPHX2 gene confers a higher risk of hypertension prevalence and increases the risk of incident ischemic stroke in male homozygotes. Additional studies are needed to confirm these data and to elucidate the interaction between gender and the EPHX2 K55R polymorphism. Introduction: CYP2J2 is responsible for the production of 5, 6-8,9-11,12-and 14 ,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, vasodilator and anti-inflammatory substances. It is abundantly expressed in human heart and also present in kidney and vasculature. Carriers of a common polymorphism, the CYP2J2 -50G>T, within the promoter region, have reduced expression of CYP2J2 mRNA level in the heart putatively through the interference with a binding site for a transcription factor with consequently reduced circulating levels of CYP2J2 epoxygenase metabolites in vivo. Aim: To evaluate the effect of this polymorphism on blood pressure (BP) levels, hypertension prevalence, and risk of incident cardiovascular events in middle-aged Swedes. Methods: The polymorphisms were genotyped in nearly 6000 subjects recruited in the cardiovascular cohort of the 'Malmo\u00a8Diet and Cancer' Study. The incidence of cardiovascular events (coronary events, n = 261; ischemic stroke, n = 185) was monitored over 10 years of follow-up. The analysis of BP levels was performed twice: either excluding or including subjects under antihypertensive treatment. Results: In the whole population the polymorphism had no effect on BP and hypertension prevalence and no interaction was found between the polymorphism and gender, age or body mass index. Before and after adjustment for major cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratio for incident ischemic stroke and coronary events was not significantly different in carriers of different genotypes. Conclusions: Our data do not support a major role for the CYP2J2 -50G>T variant in determining BP level and incident ischemic events in middle aged Caucasians. Other studies are needed to elucidate if other polymorphisms in the same gene could have a role in BP homeostasis or incidence of cardiovascular events.",

Plasma levels of NPY are increased in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) and are independently related to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and incident CV events in these patients. Methods: Since Mendelian randomization studies are better than purely associative studies for assessing causality, we investigated the relationship between a polymorphism of NPY2R gene (T585C) and the severity of LVH at echocardiography in 239 ESRD patients (age: 60 -15 years; M: 135; F: 104). Furthermore, we analysed the association between NPY2R polymorphism and atherosclerosis in a representative subgroup of 133 ESRD patients who underwent the Eco-Colour Doppler study of the carotid arteries. Results: The distribution of NPY2R polymorphism (TT genotype: 23%; TC genotype: 46%; CC genotype: 31%) did not deviate from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Overall, LVMI was directly related to plasma NPY concentration (r = 0.29, p < 0.001). In a fully adjusted analysis, the presence of the C allele (CC and CG genotypes) was a clear-cut modifier for the effect of NPY on LVMI (highly significant interaction term in the multiple regression analysis, p = 0.008). Furthermore, the total number of atherosclerotic plaques was significantly higher (p = 0.008) in patients with the C allele (median: 4 plaques, inter-quartile range: 1-6 plaques) than in those without this allele (median: 1 plaque, inter-quartile 0-3 plaques) and this relationship remained statistically significant (a = 0.21, p = 0.01) in multiple linear regression analysis. No interaction was found between the presence of C allele and plasma levels of NPY for predicting the total number of atherosclerotic plaques.",

Introduction: Structural cardiac alterations may occur in patients affected by systemic sclerosis, due at least in part, to substitution of myocardial tissue with collagen. However it is not known at which stage of the disease cardiac fibrosis is detectable by ultrasonography. Aim: To investigate by ultrasonography if cardiac fibrosis is already detectable at an early stage in sclerodermic patients, without clinic cardiopathy and no respiratory or muscle involvement. Methods: We studied 27 patients (22 females, 5 males, age 60.7 -1.7 years, means -SE) affected by systemic sclerosis without clinically relevant cardiac, pulmonary and skeletal muscle impairment (carbon dioxide lung diffusibility DLCO, 6 min walking test, echocardiography). In each patient the presence of cardiac fibrosis was assessed by integrated backscatter (IBS) analysis. 13 healthy age and sex matched subjects served as controls (age 51 -2.4 years). Results: Left ventricular (LV) end diastolic diameter (EDD) LV mass indexed by BSA, LV ejection fraction (EF) and diastolic function (transmitral PW E A, DEC time, and Mitral annulus TDI) were similar in the 2 groups and in the range of normality, although E A'm and especially Sm are higher in the control group in compared to sclerodermic patients (Sm 10 -0.1 vs 6.5 -0.4 msec, p < 0.05). Average IBS was significantly increased in the sclerodermic patients compared to controls (average value of IBS 26.4 -1.3 dB vs 22.1 -1.5, plus 20%, p < 0.04).",

Thus IBS evaluation may provide additional information on the presence of early cardiac fibrosis, even in asymptomatic patients. Introduction: Ischemic cardiopathy can be associated with diastolic dysfunction and with an increase in arterial stiffness. It has not established, however, if these alterations can be modified by myocardial revascularization. Methods: We investigated 39 patients (age 59 -3.2 years, SBP DBP 127 72 -3 7 mmHg HR 66 -3.3, means -SE) admitted to hospital to undergo coronary angiography because of stable ischemic cardiopathy. In 21 patients coronary angiography led to a diagnosis of significant coronary stenosis which implied a treatment by PTCA and stenting or by-pass surgery (group A). The remaining 18 patients were not treated because of the absence of significant coronary stenosis (group B). All patients were on antihypertensive, lipid lowering and antiplatelet drugs. In each patient we performed a standard echocardiogram to evaluate LV diameters, systolic and diastolic function (EF and E A respectively) plus tissue doppler (TDI) analysis (lateral and septal mitral annulus E Am). Moreover we assessed vascular function by means of pulse wave velocity (as index of arterial distensibility) and flow mediated dilatation (as index of endothelial function). Measurements were obtained at baseline (B) and six months later. Results: At B, there was no difference in the two group as far as BP, standard systolic and diastolic function, c-f PWV (12.3 -0.7 vs 12.1 -0.7 m s), and percentage of radial FMD increase (+11 vs 10%) were concerned, LVMI was increased and E Am decreased in the group with severe coronary stenosis (LVMI 130.3 -5.3 vs 100.4 -7.2 gr mq, p < 0.002), (E Am 0.6 -0.01 vs 0.8 -0.01, p < 0.05). After six months the two groups A and B showed no significant change in the measured variables, except for LVMI which showed a reduction (from 130.3 -5.3 to 115.6 -8.7 gr mq, NS.) and diastolic function evaluated by TDI which was significantly increased (septal E Am 0.9 -0.01 vs 0.6 -0.09, p < 0.03) in the group who underwent cardiac revascularization. C-f PWV and FMD remained unchanged after revascularization. Conclusions: Cardiac revascularization exerts a positive influence on cardiac function and structure, but does not modify significantly peripheral vascular stiffness, which is probably responsible for the progression of coronaropathy.",

Introduction: Whether left ventricular mass (LVM) should be normalized to different indexes in relation to body size is still debated. Aim: We sought to evaluate the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) defined by different indexation criteria in a cohort of hypertensive subjects categorized according to body mass index (BMI). Methods: A total of 2213 essential hypertensive subjects included in the Evaluation of Target Organ Damage in Hypertension (ETODH) were divided in three groups according to BMI thresholds (<25, 25-29.9 and \u202130 kg m 2 ). All patients underwent extensive investigations including quantitative echocardiography. LVH was defined as an LVM index equal to or higher than (1) 125 g m 2 in men and 110 g m 2 in women, (2) 51 g m 4 2.7 in men and 47 g m 4 2.7 in women. Results: Overall, 687 out of 2213 patients (31.0%) were found to have LVH when LVM was indexed to body surface area (BSA) and 1030 (46.5%) when indexed to height 4 2.7. A total of 845 patients (38.2%) had normal BMI, 954 patients (43.1%) were overweight and 414 (18.7%) were obese. Prevalence rates of LVH in the three groups were 25.1, 31.6, 41.2% by indexation to BSA and 29.9, 50.5, 71.8% by indexation to height2.7, respectively. Conclusions: LVM indexed to BSA markedly underestimates LVH prevalence in obese as well as overweight hypertensive patients. To avoid a systematic misclassification of cardiovascular risk, LVM should be routinely indexed to height2.7 in overweight and obese patients representing a large percentage of the hypertensive population.

Indeed, despite the similar improvement of respiratory performance, only in the group of patients with weight reduction there was BP reduction, LV hypertrophy regression and improvement of diastolic function. Conclusions: Our data show that diabetes is associated with an increase of LV mass and wall thicknesses in hypertensive patients with CKD. In our sample the prevalence of LVH was similar in patients with and without, but DM was found to be associated with higher prevalence of concentric and mixed LVH.

Both hypertension and hormonal factors, such as insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, cause the evolution of cardiac damage which, in turn, leads to the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Aim: To define whether the increased RWT is associated to the above-mentioned hormonal factors and chromogranine-A, suggestive of the activation of adrenergic system. Methods: We enrolled 338 hypertensive subjects (male 152, female 186), aged 50.7 -13.4, normogluco-tolerant (NGT) by oral-glucose-tolerance-test (OGTT). We classified these subjects into two groups based on RWT, normal or high, using Ganau's classification, which stratifies this echocardiographic index according to age. We considered anthropometric parameters, such as BMI, waist circumference (WC), glucose and insulin plasma concentrations at time 0 0 and 120 0 (G0, G120, Ins0 and Ins120), insulin-resistance index (HOMAIR), insulin-sensitivity index (EISI), aldosterone (Ald) and chromogranine-A (ChromoA). Results: Hypertensive subjects with elevated RWT (n. 197) have BMI, WC, Ins0, HOMAIR, Ald and ChromoA significantly higher than those with normal RWT. Male subjects with elevated RWT (n. 98) exhibit levels of Ald higher than those with normal RWT, while BMI, WC, HOMAIR and EISI are not different between the two groups. This same analysis in female subjects demonstrates that BMI, WC and chromoA are higher when RWT is increased (n. 99). Male and female subjects with increased RWT show no difference in hormonal factors with respect to normals, except for Ins120 which is higher in females. Conclusions: We conclude that hormonal factors play a role in the worsening cardiac geometry of hypertension: aldosterone is important in males, chromogranine-A in females. Female hypertensive subjects exhibit an impaired insulin action even though still in the normal glucose tolerance range. Introduction: Diastolic dysfunction is usually associated and often precedes left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients. Aim: To evaluate the sensitivity of different echocardiographic parameters in order to estimate diastolic dysfunction prevalence in arterial hypertension. Methods: We studied 308 essential hypertensive patients (mean agestandard deviation 49.8 -11 years; SBP DBP 140.4 -15 84.9 -10 mmHg). Every subject underwent clinic evaluation, echocardiography with ultrasound systems (ATL 5000) equipped with multiple frequency phased array transducers (2 to 4 MHz) to study left ventricular morphology and function. Transmitralic Doppler (Dopp mitr), Doppler of pulmonary veins (PVarD, Adur) flow, tissue Doppler of mitral annulus (E' sep, E' lat) and left atrial volume (LAV ind) were acquired for each patient. Results: Transmitralic Doppler alone (figure), allows the detection of diastolic dysfunction in 34% of hypertensive patients. When this parameter was combined with Tissue Doppler, Pulmonary veins Doppler and LAV ind, about 40% of subjects previously classified as normal, resulted affected by diastolic dysfunction (p < 0.001).

Since EH+ subjects also show consistently a slightly higher blood pressure (BP), the relative contribution to such LV abnormalities of BP levels and of other BP-independent LV primary changes developing early in the prehypertensive age remains unknown. Methods: Twenty-three normotensive sedentary male EH+ (age 25 -3 years) and 20 age-matched male EH-participated in the study. All of them underwent clinic BP measurement, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), measurements of the frequency-domain parameters of autonomic heart rate control and conventional and Doppler Tissue Echocardiographic study of both ventricles. LV Relative Wall Thickness (RWT, i.e. the ratio between the sum of interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness to LV diameter) was used as a measure of LV remodeling. EH+ subjects had higher office systolic and diastolic (p < 0.05), average 24-hour systolic (p < 0.001), diastolic (p < 0.01) and mean (p < 0.05) BP.",

Methods: 88 patients (45 men and 43 women), aged 32-50 years, having a very recent onset of essential hypertension (140-179 mmHg as systolic blood pressure and 90-109 mmHg as diastolic blood pressure), and not treated by antihypertensive drugs, were consecutively enrolled into the study. Patients underwent a standard echo 2D M-mode echocardiography, and indexed left ventricular mass (ILVM) has been measured either per body surface or per height to correct data for the influence of overweight and obesity, with a cut-off of 51 g h. Ventricular geometry has been measured by the RWT parameter ([interventricular septum + behind wall] telediastolic diameter of left ventricle), with a cut-off of 0.45. Diastolic function has been evaluated by standard doppler imaging (E peak velocity, e deceleration time, A peak velocity, E A ratio) and by tissue doppler imaging (TDI), placed on the lateral and on the septum wall of the mitral annulus. Results: 22 patients (25%) showed a normal ILVM, 25 subjects (28.5%) had a left ventricular concentric remodeling, 27 individuals (30.6%) had a concentric LVH, and 14 patients (16.0%) had an eccentric LVH. Diastolic function was normal in hypertensive subjects with normal ILVM, whereas it was impaired in hypertensive subjects with LVH, showing the longest E-DT and the shortest E A ratio in subjects with concentric LVH. TDI was similar to that obtained by the traditional method, showing the lowest Em Am ratio measured either on the lateral or on the septum wall of the mitral valve, and the highest E Em in concentric LVH. Conclusions: Our data confirm the importance to identify different left ventricular geometries in hypertensive patients with LVH, since they may influence the prognosis and the therapy. Diastolic function, as measured by the traditional method or by the TDI, has shown a more compromised left ventricular compliance in concentric LVH. Introduction: Thickening of the inner layer of the carotid arteries is an early indicator of organ damage in patients with hypertension. The intima-media thickness (IMT) has been demonstrated to be related with structural and functional abnormalities of the heart in hypertensive patients. Aim: In this study, we have investigated the relationships of the IMT with parameters of cardiac function as assessed by pulsed wave tissue-Doppler echocardiography. Methods: In 301 patients with grade I-II essential hypertension (age 60 -13 years; 165 males, 136 females) we performed ultrasound carotid scan and echocardiography both with standard methodology and with pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). Patients with an ejection fraction of less than 50% and relevant cardiac valve disease were excluded. The carotid scan and echocardiography were performed according to current guidelines; in TDI myocardial systolic and diastolic velocities were measured at the lateral and septal corner of the mitral annulus. Results: An IMT of more than 900 mm was found in 124 (41%) of 301 patients. The IMT was correlated directly with left atrial diameter, left ventricular mass index, relative wall thickness (RWT), and early deceleration time (all p < 0.001), and inversely with the E A velocity ratio (p < 0.001). The IMT was also directly related with parameters of diastolic (septal E Em, p < 0.001 and lateral E Em, p = 0.007) and systolic function (septal Sm, p = 0.004 and lateral Sm, p < 0.001) as assessed by TDI. Multiple regression analysis that was performed with inclusion of demographic and anthropometric variables showed statistically significant correlations only between the IMT and intraventricular septum thickness (p = 0.015), posterior wall thickness (p = 0.021), and RWT (p = 0.011). Inclusion of age in the multivariate model eliminated the relationship between IMT and diastolic parameters. Conclusions: Thickening of the inner carotid layer is independently related with left ventricular mass in patients with hypertension, whereas the relationship with diastolic dysfunction is dependent on the age of patients. and clinic blood pressure (BP), left ventricular (LV) structure and function were evaluated by echocardiography (Mono-bidimensional + conventional and tissue Doppler analysis). Results: By definition no differences were observed for age, sex, BMI, BP and heart rate. LV mass index was significantly greater in patients with APO A-I amyloidosis than controls (35.6 -12.8 vs 32.7 -7.3 g m2.7, p < 0.05). Relative wall thickness was similar in the two groups (0.32 -0.07 vs 0.30 -0.05, p = ns). The absolute value of mitral annular e velocity (Em) was significantly lower in patients with APO A-I amyloidosis (8.6 -3.4 vs 9.7 -2.2, p < 0.05), and the ratio of transmitral e velocity (E) to Em, (E Em ratio) a sensitive index of LV filling pressure, was significantly greater (9.7 -4.2 vs 8.0 -2.1, p < 0.005). Ejection fraction, fractional shortening and midwall fractional shortening were significantly lower in amyloidosis as compared to controls (64.0 -7.0 vs 66.3 -5.9, p < 0.05; 37.2 -8.3 vs 40.2 -7.4, p < 0.005 and 19.2 -3.8 vs 20.8 -3.0, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: In patients with Apolipoprotein A-I amyloidosis (Leu75Pro) a significant increase in LV mass associated with an impairment of systolic and diastolic function has been observed. These results, obtained in a wide sample of patients, may add significant information to the clinic features of this rare genetic disorder. Introduction: Cardiorespiratory response during maximal exercise provides important pathophysiological information in patients with left ventricular failure. Few studies have investigated the cardiopulmonary testing response of hypertensive patients whose better characterization could help to improve the therapeutic approach. Methods: 45 patients with arterial hypertension [mean age: 40 -9 years] underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing before (T0) and after aerobic physical training period (T1, mean duration: 99 -16 days). We considered peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 ), aerobic efficiency (VO 2 WR), the ventilatory efficiency slope during exercise (VE VCO 2 slope), heart rate and oxygen consumption ratio (HR VO 2 ), and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) at peak of exercise. Results: All variables considered improved significantly after aerobic physical training period (table; T0 vs T1: # p < 0.01; * p = 0.03). A statistically significant decrease in exercise SAP was observed (-5.9 -17.7 mmHg, p = 0.02), which correlated with VO 2 change (p < 0.01).",

Aerobic physical training improves all the cardiopulmonary variables considered, and modulates SAP during exercise. Changes observed in VE VCO2 slope and HR VO 2 suggest a potential putative role of an improved neuromediated control. Our results indicate that the variables investigated could be considered as additional target of anti-hypertensive treatment targets. Conclusions: In our group of treated hypertensive patients at high-risk because of LV hypertrophy, less than one in four (22%) HF events were related to intercurrent MI. In all patients development of HF was associated with more dilated LV geometry (reduction in RWT) and signs of increased LV filling pressures (increased mitral E A ratio and or IVRT shortening). A mild reduction in EF was observed only in patients with MI-related HF. , and diastolic (E') annular velocities were obtained by TDI, while longitudinal myocardial systolic velocity (Vl) was obtained by speckle tracking. Circumferential, longitudinal, and radial strains (Sc, Sl, Sr), obtained by speckle tracking, were used as indices of global LV function. FSmw and peak basal longitudinal strain (basal Sl) were used as indices of regional function. Results: Hypertensive patients had lower velocities: TDI E' and S', as well as Vl. However, strains -Sc, Sl, and Sr -were similar. E E' ratio, an index of LV filling pressure, was higher among hypertensive patients. Both E' and E E' correlated with RWT (r = 0.34, r = 0.21, p < 0.05). Hypertensive patients showed reduced regional systolic function (FSmw and basal Sl), and impaired diastolic function; while global strain was not different among study groups. However among hypertensive patients, significant inverse associations were found between LV mass and global longitudinal (r = -0.51) and circumferential S (r = -0.21; both p < 0.05; figure) . . Accordingly, prevalence of LVH was significantly higher in uncontrolled HTN when the classification was based on c-SBP (30 vs 6% p = 0.05).",

Evaluation of low SV as a prognostic marker might be difficult because of its strong biological co-linearity with high LV mass (LVM). Aim: We prognostically compared and assessed the interaction among EF, SV and LVM in a large population free of cardiovascular disease. Methods: We analyzed 8-year survival curves of quintiles of EF, SV (z-derived method) and LV mass (LVM) in 2323 participants of the Strong Heart Study (58 -7 years; 62% women, 39% hypertensive patients, 45% diabetics and 54% obese) without valvular heart diseases or prevalent coronary heart diseases, stroke or heart failure. Results: Risk of composite fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events progressively increased from the highest to the lowest quintiles of EF (log rank = 21.7; p = 0.0002) and from the lowest to the highest quintiles of LVM (log rank = 40.8; p < 0.00001). In contrast, SV did not show significant predictive value. LVM was negatively related to EF (r = -0.37), but was positively correlated with SV (r = 0.66), (both p < 0.0001). Thus, the level of LVM, could confound evaluation of the association of SV with subsequent CV events. Thus, we evaluated LV pump performance per gram of LVM (SV LVM). Kaplan Meier curves revealed a progressively higher rate of CV events from the highest to the lowest quintiles of SV LVM (log rank = 36.3; p < 0.0001). Cox regression, adjusting for age and sex and including EF, SV and LVM showed that hazard of incident CV events increased with higher LVM (HR = 1.1 10 g, CI = 1.05, 1.12, p < 0.0001) and lower SV (HR = 0.90 10 mL, CI = 0.80, 0.98; p < 0.01), with no independent effect of EF (HR = 0.90 10%, CI = 0.70, 1.03, p = 0.11).",

The association of diabetes with incident HF might be at least in part due to coexistent diabetes-associated abnormalities of left ventricular (LV) geometry and function that might favor the progression to HF. Methods: We analyzed incidence of HF (8.91 -2.76 years) in relation with echocardiographic phenotypes in 2 757 diabetic (DM) or non-diabetic (ND) participants (1777 women) of the 2nd exam of the Strong Heart Study (SHS), without prevalent HF, coronary heart disease or severe kidney disease.

LV delayed relaxation and greater arterial stiffness are important predictors of HF in DM, but other reasons of the residual association between DM and HF remain to be clarified. Introduction: Growth hormone-deficient adults (GHDA) display an increased sympathetic activity, a condition widely considered as an important cardiovascular risk factor. In these patients GH replacement is followed by only partial correction of this sympathetic alteration. In acromegaly old data obtained with indirect measurement of adrenergic tone have shown a normal sympathetic outflow while more recently power spectral analysis of heart rate documented a sympatho-vagal imbalance due to parasympathetic hyperactivity. Aim: To assess the adrenergic tone in a homogeneous group of acromegalic patients through direct measurement of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Methods: We studied three groups of subjects: (a) 12 patients (5 men Conclusions: Cardiovascular structure and function is related to aldosterone levels in PH. Both surgical or medical treatment of PH may improve such alteration, and this seems to be not related to changes in BP. Results: AT1R and AT2R levels did not differ between BS GS and healthy controls. Ang II induced ERK1 2 phosphorylation in BS GS fibroblasts but peak ERK1 2 phosphorylation declined more rapidly than control and BS GS fibroblasts also exhibited increased MKP-1 levels at 30 minutes incubation. PD123319, an AT2R blocker in BSGS fibroblasts abolished the increased MKP-1 and ERK1 2 phosphorylation time course became the same as control. Losartan, an AT1R blocker alone altered the time course of control fibroblast MKP-1 to mimic the increase seen in BS GS fibroblasts while ERK1 2 declined concomitantly. Treatment with Losartan plus PD123319 in controls reduced MKP-1 and elevated ERK1 2 phosphorylation to those observed in BS GS plus PD123319. Conclusions: ERK1 2 phosphorylation time course found in BS GS fibroblasts tracked changes in MKP-1 levels and incubation with an AT2R blocker, PD123319 abrogated those responses. Losartan, an AT1R blocker, reproduced these changes in healthy controls while the presence in controls of both AT1R and AT2R inhibitors abolished these changes. These data strongly suggest that MKP-1 is a major effector in altering ERK1 2 phosphorylation status. Moreover the results explain the blunted responses in BS GS reported for Ang II short and long term effects, provide insight into the mechanisms responsible and thereby yield additional support for the role of AT2R signaling in the proposed effects of Ang II AT1R blockers beyond AT1R blockade. Introduction: ACE and ACE2 produce angiotensin II (Ang II), vasopressor, inducer of cardiovascular remodeling and Ang 1-7, vasodilator and antiremodeling factor. In addition, while Ang 1-7 has antiarrhythmic properties, at higher concentration it may induce ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. ACE2, therefore, may play essential role in blood pressure homeostasis, hypertension long term complications (cardiovascular remodeling) and in the induction of cardiac electric abnormalities.",

BS GS were also considered given their not completely clarified predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias. Methods: Mononuclear cell ACE2 and Ang 1-7 were evaluated using western blot. Conclusions: The increases of ACE2 and Ang 1-7 in BS GS mirror those in hypertensive patients and are in line with the clinic, haemodynamic and pathophysiological characteristics of BS GS patients, likely contributing to them and further strengthen the importance of ACE2 Ang 1-7 system in cardiovascular biology. Introduction: Aldosterone (A) is involved in oxidative stress and inflammation, particularly at the cardiovascular level. The prooxidative action of aldosterone has been associated both to genomic and nongenomic effects. We have recently showed that the inflammatory process can also be evaluated in erythrocytes analyzing biochemical parameters of the erythrocyte membranes, as in the case of Tyr-phosphorylation of 3 band. Moreover, the analysis of this protein could provide further material for evaluating the inflammatory status associated with endometriosis, a gynaecological situation associated with inflammatory status and cardiovascular complications. Aim: To evaluate the renin aldosterone axis in these patients and to evaluate the non genomic oxidative status in erythrocytes of these patients. Methods: 15 patients affected by ovarian endometriosis and 15 healthy controls matched for BMI and age were studied. Diagnosis was made by the usual exams and laparoscopy. The following plasma parameters were measured: A, PRA, sodium, potassium. Erythrocytes were isolated to measure total glutathione, oxidized glutathione, the analysis of the Tyr-phosphorylation levels in band 3 of the erythrocyte membranes and of its modifications alterations at the membrane level.",

In all patients, after surgery A levels were lower (315 -81.5 pmol L, p < 0.05). PRA and electrolytes did not change after surgery while aldosterone PRA ratio was normal. The in vitro data of the erythrocytes isolated from the patients showed an increase of the Tyr-phosphorylation of the band 3 of the erythrocyte membrane and a minor concentration of glutathione reduced in oxidative stress conditions. Conclusions: Endometriosis is associated with an increase of aldosterone and with Tyrphosphorylation at the level of erythrocyte membrane and all these abnormalities are reversed after surgery. We hypothesize that aldosterone plays an important role in the inflammatory state of endometriosis. The analysis of the Tyr-phosphorylation of band 3 of this protein could be related to a non genomic effect of aldosterone on plasma membrane as reported by other studies. Introduction: At present Primary Aldosteronism (PA) is recognized as the most frequent cause of secondary hypertension. The change in the estimated prevalence has been mainly due to the widespread use of the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) as screening tool. Once the result of screening test is positive, PA diagnosis needs further confirmation by means of an inhibitory test such as iv saline load (SLT). Aim: To investigate the role of female hormones in the work-up of patients suspected for having PA; by both evaluating possible differences by gender on the rate of saline loading inhibitory tests response and analysing the influence of free and pill-induced menstrual cycle on orthostatic ARR determination. Method: We retrospectively examined the folders of 85 hypertensive patients who underwent iv SLT after a positive ARR screening. The screening test was considered to be positive when plasma aldosterone concentration was >150 pg mL and orthostatic ARR was >32 pg mL (ratio of aldosterone, expressed as pg mLl-1, to direct active renin, expressed as pg mL-1). We enrolled also 33 healthy fertile women, and analyzed ARR during free menstrual cycle (in the mid-cycle and luteal phase) and after two months of oral contraceptive (OC) therapy.",

Introduction: Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits aldosterone (Aldo) secretion from adrenal glomerulosa cells. Experimental hypertension induced by chronic NO-synthase inhibition is associated with increased plasma Aldo and interstitial fibrosis, which is reversed by spironolactone. In order to investigate the relationship between NO and Aldo secretion in human hypertension, we examined whether platelet cGMP, as a marker of NO activity, is related to plasma Aldo in essential hypertensive patients (EH). Methods: In 103 untreated EH males (age 43.4 -1.4 yr, K+ 4.2 -0.04 mEq L), systolic, diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP, sphygmo) and heart rate (HR, pulse rate) were measured after a 60 min supine rest and venous blood was sampled for determination of plasma Aldo, renin activity (PRA), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and platelet cGMP (PLTcGMP; RIA on acid extracts of washed platelets).",

In the present study, we sought to examine ET-secretion from the adrenal glands in patients with Primary Aldosteronism (PA). Methods: We determined ET-1 levels in adrenal vein blood of 17 patients with confirmed PA undergoing AVS [7 adenomas (APA) and 10 bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH)]. Only samples obtained from successful and diagnostic adrenal vein cannulation were used. To account for cannulation variability, raw ET-1 concentrations in adrenal bloo samples were normalized by local cortisol concentrations. Plasma ET-1 was measured by radioimmunoassay. We also examined the mRNA expression of the ET system in tissue samples from aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs, n = 9) and control normal adrenal (n = 3).Tissue mRNA expression of the ET system was assayed with Affymetrix microarrays. Results: ET-1 levels did not differ between inferior vena cava and adrenal vein blood in both bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and APA patients.

The patients were carefully prepared from the pharmacologic standpoint, as previously described. The diagnosis of aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), based on the 'four corner criteria', was used as referent. The Bland-Altman plot and coefficient of repeatability were used to determine the reproducibility of the ARR. Results: Data for within-patients comparison of the ARR were available in 262 patients, of which 43 were conclusively diagnosed as APA. The ARR showed a highly significant within-patient correlation (r = 0.51, p < 0.0001) and repeatability. By Bland & Altman plot we found no evidence for proportional, magnitude-related, and absolute systematic error between the two ARR; moreover, only 4.3% of the values, e.g. the proportion that was predicted by chance, fell out of the 95% confidence interval for the between test difference. Finally, the overall concordance rate of the two ARR for pinpointing APA patients was 85%. Most discordant or false negative results could be accounted for by obvious protocol violations. Conclusions: Albeit being performed under different conditions in a large multicenter study, the ARR showed a good within-patient repeatability. Thus, while challenging the claimed poor reproducibility of the ARR, these data support the use of this simple test for the screening of PA, provided that strict adherence to a predefined protocol is followed. Introduction: Primary aldosteronism is the most common endocrine cause of hypertension but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Aldosterone Producing Adenomas (APAs) were found to be heterogeneous at both the clinic and the molecular level. They respond differently in vivo to stimuli as ACTH and angiotensin II and despite featuring aldosterone overproduction they exhibited a heterogeneous expression of the steroidogenic enzymes when assessed with a whole transcriptome approach. Thus, the mechanisms leading to hyperaldosteronism and APA development are by far more complex than increased aldosterone synthase gene expression. Aim: To disentangle this complexity we investigated the expression profile of microRNAs (miR), a number of short nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate gene expression for which no data in APAs are currently available.",

Introduction: We previously identified with adrenal vein sampling (AVS) and ACTH stimulation ACTH-responsive (ACTH-R) and ACTH non-responsive (ACTH-NR) aldosterone producing adenomas (APA). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this divergent responsiveness to ACTH are unknown. Aim: To investigate if: (1) ACTH-R and ACTH-NR APA are characterized by different gene profiles, and (2) cultured cells isolated from ACTH-R or ACTH-NR APA maintain the responsiveness to ACTH in vitro and therefore can be useful to explore the mechanisms of the responsiveness to ACTH. Methods: APA were diagnosed by the 'four corner' criteria developed in the PAPY Study (JACC 2006; 48:2293) . RNA from APA (n = 16) and pooled control RNAs from normal adrenocortical tissues (n = 8) were hybridized to Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray. The microarray results were analysed with Feature Extraction and Rosetta Resolver and results were confirmed with quantitative real time RT-PCR (Q RT-PCR). Cells isolated from APA were incubated with 10-8 M ACTH and aldosterone secretion in the medium (RIA) and CYP11B2 gene expression was analyzed (Q RT-PCR). APA cells were also cultured and examined with electron microscopy (EM) at day 2, 4, and 6. Results: We identified 24 genes that differed between ACTH-R and ACTH-NR APA, of which four code for K+ channel subunits. The 24 gene subset allowed correct classification of APA as ACTH-R or ACTH-NR with an overall accuracy greater than 80%, when applied retrospectively. KCNH8, which encodes for the 'ether-a`-go-go like' K+ channel (elk)-1, exhibited the most marked expression differences between ACTH-R and ACTH-NR APAs. Q-RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis confirmed the elk-1 gene expression in APAs. EM showed that the cultured cells maintained their original features only up to day 4. Noteworthy, after ACTH stimulation aldosterone production and CYP11B2 mRNA expression in the isolated and cultured cells at day 4 did not differ between ACTH-R and ACTH-NR.",

Aim: To identify new predictive parameters of reappearance of hypertension in patients who underwent adrenal gland removal. Methods: 70 patients (37 men and 33 women), aged 26-78 years, 59 hypertensive and 11 normotensive. The hypertensive group had patients with recent onset of hypertension or old diagnosis of the disease, but with recently developed resistance to drug therapy. Only 10 of hypertensive patients them had not family history of hypertension. All of patients had performed a adrenal gland MRI or TC before surgery, with the aim of defining the volume of the tumors. Spongiocytic adenomas (n = 9) had a volume of 1.0-7.0 cm, micronodular hyperplasias (n = 4) were 0.5-3.0 cm, pheochromocytomas (Pheo) (n = 8) were 3-5 cm, 1 haemorrhagic lesion had a volume of 12 cm, 1 mielolipoma 5 cm, 1 mixoid liposarcoma 17 cm, and 1 adenocarcinoma 6 cm. Results: Concerning hormone evaluation, 1 adenocarcinoma, 2 of 4 cases of micronodular hyperplasia, and 8 of 9 cases of spongiocytic adenomas were characterized by high 24-hour urine cortisol. Only 2 of 8 cases of Pheo had high 24-hour urine catecholamines. Plasma aldosterone PRA ratio was high in all cases of micronodular hyperplasias and in 6 of 9 cases of spongiocytic adenomas. Plasma DHEAS was high only in the patient with adenocarcinoma. High blood pressure (BP) was normalized after 1 month of adrenal gland removal in all patients with Pheo, in all subjects with micronodular hyperplasias, and in 7 of 9 cases of spongiocytic adenomas. After 6 months from surgery, BP had increased in 2 of 8 patients with Pheo, in 2 of 4 subjects with micronodular hyperplasias, and in 5 of 9 cases of spongiocytic adenomas. Conclusions: Hypertensive patients who underwent adrenal gland removal have not actually solved their problem of hypertension. Whether this result is due to a pre-existing essential hypertension, it is difficult to explain by the BP changes after 6 months from surgery. We would like to suggest that it is very important the clinic evaluation in patients with adrenal gland alterations, to decide whether and when to address the patient to the surgeon and what to wait for after adrenal gland removal. Introduction: In primary aldosteronism, target organ damage is greater than in age-, sex-and blood pressure-matched controls, reflecting the ability of elevated aldosterone to produce structural and functional changes over and above those produced by high blood pressure. Several studies have separately reported that complications are more evident in the cardiovascular system, and lesser in the kidney, although substantial.

No differences are observed between APA and AHA in different TOD prevalence. Results: An increase in heart rate was found in LP if compared to NP (D +8%; p = 0.024); LV wall thicknesses (interventricular septum and posterior wall) at end-diastole systole were higher in LP, while LV diameters, even if slightly greater, and Ejection Fraction were not significantly different in the studied groups. Cardiac Output was increased in LP (D +30%; p = 0.03) mainly due to the combined increase in Stroke Volume and Heart Rate (HR). Furthermore, LV mass was increased in LP (D +23%; p = 0.04) with a high prevalence of LV hypertrophy (n = 3; 43%), classified as EH in 2 cases, and as CH in 1 case. Some differences were found when comparing MRI and 2D-echo linear measurements, especially in LV wall thicknesses, that were generally underestimated by 2D-echo if compared with MRI. Moreover, geometric differences were found in geometric patterns assignment, where 2D-echo misclassified a case of CH.",

Introduction: Primary aldosteronism (PA) has been shown to follow a variable course in pregnancy, characterized by an high prevalence of preterm delivery, placental abruption, intrauterine fetal death and fetal distress. In a small number of patients (n = 3 cases reported in literature) blood pressure decline spontaneously. Clinic Case: In May 2007 our patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism expressed the willing to get pregnant. She was referred to our clinic for the first time in 2005, when she is 28 years old, with palpitation and severe hypertension. After hormonal evaluation, CT scan of adrenal glands and the adrenal venous sampling, PA due to bilateral aldosterone oversecretion was diagnosed. She started treatment with MR antagonist (potassium canrenoate, 100 mg day) and calcium channel antagonist (amlodipine 10 mg day) with good control of high blood pressure (130 80 mmHg) and maintenance of normokalemia. Planning a pregnancy, the MR antagonist was withdrawn due to the concern of causing possible feminization of male infant, while calcium channel blocker was continued and oral potassium supplementation was started (40-48 mEq day). In July 2007 she got pregnant. During pregnancy, despite higher aldosterone levels (219 pg mL at 11a week, 561 pg mL at 24a week and 860 pg mL at 36a week) with arising in progesterone (42.5 ng mL at 11a week, 95 ng mL at 24a week and 232 ng mL at 36a week), blood pressure decline to normal values so that she gradually discontinued antihypertensive treatment and continued only potassium supplementation. The patient was tightly followed by clinic and biochemical evaluations during pregnancy which course was uncomplicated. She had a vaginal delivery at term (38 weeks of gestation), and gave birth to a healthy boy. Pathological examination of the placenta showed a normal vascular structure without signs of damage due to aldosterone excess. 24 hour after the delivery, supine plasma aldosterone levels were 299 pg mL while plasma progesterone values were 31 ng mL. The post-delivery course was characterized by normotension until 4 days after delivery, then blood pressure began to rise again and she had to reintroduce antihypertensive treatment, while the aldosterone levels started to decreased. Conclusions: We conclude that a previous planning of pregnancy, an early and appropriate medical therapy and vigilance regarding the occurrence of possible complications are recommended in the not rare condition of PA in pregnancy, in order to reduce both the maternal and fetal risks associated with this disease. Introduction: Hypertension during pregnancy is common and a major cause of maternal, foetal and neonatal morbidity. The choice of antihypertensive drugs in women who want to conceive must be prudent as some antihypertensive drugs are not safe for the infant and the pharmacological treatment of hypertension during pregnancy only limits progression to severe hypertension. Aim: To correlate pregnancy outcome, complications with antihypertensive treatment and blood pressure control in patients with chronic hypertension. Methods: We identified 49 pregnant hypertensive patients attending the hypertension outpatient clinic of Padua between 1983 and 2008 with 54 pregnancies. Aetiology of hypertension, antihypertensive treatment before, during and after pregnancy, number and type of drugs, office blood pressure control during pregnancy, risk factors for pre-eclampsia, laboratory findings suggestive of pre-eclampsia, course and outcome of pregnancy were assessed. Results: Forty five patients (92%) had essential hypertension and 38 (73%) had been taking antihypertensive drugs before pregnancy. During pregnancy, 30 patients were treated with two or more antihypertensive drugs. Blood pressure control was good in 31 patients (59%). Twenty nine patients (56%) had maternal or foetal complications with 10 terminations of pregnancy and 84% caesarean section delivery. Risk factors for pre-eclampsia were not different between pregnant women with or without complications. Twenty eight out of 29 (97%) pregnant women with complications had been taking antihypertensive drugs. The incidence of complications was higher in treated (28 48, 58%) than in untreated patients (1 4, 25%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Beta blockers, alone or in combination, were significantly associated with complications. Upon multivariate linear regression analysis, low birth weight was independently associated with beta blocker treatment (beta = -0.218, p < 0.05) and duration of pregnancy (beta = 0.791, p < 0.001), but duration of pregnancy did not differ in patients treated with or without betablockers.",

Antihypertensive treatment and blood pressure control during pregnancy do not reduce the risk of complications, with beta-blocker administration linked to the largest incidence, especially low birth weight. Hypertensive women need a close follow-up, before, during and after pregnancy to plan the best diagnostic and therapeutic work up. Introduction: Pre-eclampsia is characterized by reduced generation of angiogenic factors and coexisting metabolic risk factors, which may independently contribute the development of the disease. Experimental data indicate that P-450 (CYP)-derived metabolites of arachidonic acid, implicated in the control blood pressure and renal excretion of sodium, may have a role in altered placental vascularization, as well as the development of hypertension and renal dysfunction in preeclamptic women. Methods: We set up a cross-sectional study in which women with pre-eclampsia (hypertension after the 20th week of pregnancy plus proteinuria >300 mg day) were compared with normotensive pregnant women of the same gestational age (30-39 weeks) and non-pregnant women. The three groups were pair-matched for age (22-38 years), pre-gravidic BMI (below 26 in all the preeclamptic women) and the absence of metabolic risk factors (obesity, diabetes, pre-existing arterial hypertension). Plasma concentrations of epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EETs) and their metabolites (DHETs, also measured in urine), together with plasma concentration and urinary excretion of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) were measured by mass-spectrometry.",

Subjects with increased arterial stiffness PWV is high, and the backward waves from the periphery return earlier to the ascending aorta. Since this backward waves coming from the periphery arrive during the LV ejection, they raise the central systolic blood pressure and the LV afterload and decrease the central diastolic pressure and the coronary perfusion pressure. These changes may cause ischaemia particularly in the subendocardium, which if chronic is associated with left ventricular interstitial fibrosis. Aim: We assessed the arterial stiffness by a non-invasive new tool known as 'e-tracking, Aloka, Japan' and the diastolic function with tissue Doppler imaging in patients with coronary microcirculation disease proved by typical anginous synthomatology, negative coronary angiography, positive myocardial scintigraphy stress test. Methods: We have observed 40 consecutive patients with angina, proved by typical clinic history, positive myocardial scintigraphy stress test and negative coronary angiography. We compared the data of arterial stiffness with the measurements of 50 healthy volunteers. We performed e-tracking on the left carotid with ALOKA alfa 10 ultrasound system.

Whether this is the case in mild renal failure is unknown, however. It is also unknown which of the two alterations has an earlier appearance in the clinic course of the disease. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that in mild to moderate renal failure two markers of adrenergic drive such as plasma NE and MSNA display a substantial increase well before any significant raise in ADMA and SDMA. This suggests that sympathetic activation (1) precedes methylarginines accumulation in the development and progression of the renal disease and (2) may be responsible for the more advanced appearance of the endothelial alteration. Results: Average (-SD) blood pressure was 142.1 -18.6 (SBP) and 86.4 -10.3(DBP) mmHg in the wall population. LVH was present in 241 (48%) of the patients, the prevalence was 5%, 14% and 10% for reduced GFR, reduced CrCl and increased IMT, respectively. There was a highly significantly correlation (p < 0.01) between all measure of organ damage although their values were never high (between 0.15 and 0.36). The relation of CrCl with LVH survived in a multiple regression model considering all risk factors measured. Organ damage in one organ was present in 39% of patients, the prevalence of two and three organ damage was 13% and 3% respectively. Conclusions: In essential hypertension organ damage is common even when blood pressure is close to or near normal values. Multiorgan damage is more rarely. CrCl seems to be the most sensible predictor of the cardiovascular target organ; CrCl is also the most related one to LVMI which is the most frequent organ damage in Hypertensive patients. Introduction: Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) is a strong predictor of increased mortality in the presence of congestive heart failure (CHF) and its prevalence has been increasing in the US. In addition, CRI is a major contributing factor to the progression of CHF as it is associated with chronic volume overload, accelerated atherosclerosis and hypertension (HTN). Aim: The first aim of the current study was to evaluate the prevalence of CRI in an adult general population. The second aim was to address whether calculated glomerular filtration rate (cGFR) adds value to the cardiac biomarkers BNP and NT-proBNP in detecting early cardiac structural and functional impairments in the general population. Methods: From 1997 to 1999 medical history, physical examination, echocardiography, BNP (Biosite) and NT-proBNP (Roche) and serum creatinine (SCr) were obtained in 1982 randomly selected residents of Olmsted County, MN \u202145 years (range 45-96 years). GFR was calculated using the Cockroft Gault equation adjusting for age, gender, body weight and surface area in which CRI was defined as a GFR <60 mL min. Cardiac structure and function were evaluated by in-depth echocardiographic examination. Results: In this random adult cohort, the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities was coronary atherosclerosis 12%, HTN 29.5% and diabetes mellitus 7.5%. The prevalence of CRI was 22.8% when cGFR was used for its detection. Importantly, cGFR significantly increased the ability of BNP in detecting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (p = 0.0044), increased relative wall thickness (RWT) (p = 0.0036), diastolic dysfunction (DDF) (p = 0.0001) and HTN (p = 0.0002). Similarly, when combined with NT-proBNP, cGFR increased the predictive power of detecting DDF (p = 0.0001) and HTN (p = 0.0366).",

Importantly, this study also demonstrates that cGFR has additive predictive power when used in combination with two important cardiac biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction and remodeling which are BNP and NT-proBNP. These studies underscore the increasing burden of CRI in the general population and the utility of assessing cardiorenal function by combining renal and cardiac biomarkers in assessment of cardiac structure and function. Introduction: Decreased GFR and microalbuminuria (MA) have been shown to predict mortality and CV events in the general population, and in high risk patients. However, their combined prognostic power in non diabetic patients with primary hypertension without overt renal damage has not been previously investigated. Aim: We assessed the prognostic role of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and all cause mortality in non diabetic patients with primary hypertension. Methods: We conducted a 11.2 year follow-up of 837 hypertensive non diabetic patients enrolled from 1993 to 1997 in the MAGIC (Microalbuminuria: A Genoa Investigation on Complications) cohort. Urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated GFR (eGFR) were assessed in untreated patients at baseline. Renal dysfunction was defined as the inclusion in the most unfavourable gender specific decile of eGFR (< 50.5 mL min in females, <69.5 mL min in males) or of ACR (>1.7 mg mmoL in females, >2.4 mg mmoL in males). The primary endpoints were the occurrence of non fatal cerebrovascular and cardiac events (CVE), composite of all cause death and CVE (CEP), and composite of CVE and chronic renal insufficiency (CRE). Results: During 9374 person-years of follow-up, the incidence rate for CVE, CRE, and all cause mortality was 6.3, 7.8, and 3.1 1000 person-years, respectively. Renal dysfunction was associated with increased risk for CVE (RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.20, 4.01, p = 0.011), CEP (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.07, 3.23, p = 0.027), and CRE (RR 2.56, 95% CI 1.48, 4.40, p<0.001), even after adjustment for several baseline covariates such as gender, duration and severity of BP, and total-cholesterol. Conclusions: Renal dysfunction is a risk factor for cardiorenal complications and all cause mortality independent of traditional confounders in non diabetic patients with primary hypertension.

Introduction: Recent studies have demonstrated that aldosterone (Aldo) can play a role in the progression of renal pathology. Aim: To evaluate the effects of in vivo administration of Aldo in the presence or absence of a high salt diet on glomerular function and on the expression of proinflammatory and prosclerotic genes. Methods: 128 Wistar uninephrectomized rats were studied for 28 days. Animals were randomized to receive the following treatment: vehicle (control group) high salt diet at 1% (NaCl-1%) and 8% (NaCl-8%), Aldo at the doses of 40 (Aldo 40) and 72 mg kg die (Aldo 72), Aldo in association with high salt diet at 1 or 8% and Aldo 72 plus saline at 8% in association with eplerenone (E) at the dose of 100 mg kg die. At 2-week intervals, body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured. At the end of the study glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria (Alb-U) were evaluated. The rats have been then decapitated, the blood collected for determination of Aldo, creatininemia and azotemia, their abdomen opened and the left kidney rapidly excised and weighed. In each group the kidneys from half of the animals have been used for determination of glomerular area (GA), glomerular sclerotic area (SGA) and glomerular albumin permeabilitry (P-alb) determination. The kidneys from the other half of the animals have been employed for gene expression studies.",

A significant increase in Alb-U and Palb was present both in the group treated with high salt diet and in group receiving Aldo 72 and high salt diet. In these groups were also evident a gene hyperexpression of CTGF (Connective tissue growth factor) and MCP-1 (Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1). The increase in SBP, GA, SGA and the alteration in Alb-U and P-alb were prevented by treatment with E. Conclusions: Aldo may induce an alteration of glomerular function only when it is administered together with a high salt diet which can independently affect glomerular function.

A relation between insulin sensitivity and left ventricular morphology and function has been reported in essential hypertension, where a high prevalence of NAFLD has been recently found.

Mancia 1 1 Universit\u00e0 Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy; 2 Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy Introduction: Previous studies have shown that sympathetic activation and insulin resistance are closely related each other, suggesting that this metabolic disarray represents the driving force for the adrenergic overdrive seen in different cardiometabolic disease. Frequently, however, the presence of conditions that ''per se'' exert sympathoexcitation, such as hypertension and obesity, did act as confounders, preventing definite conclusions to be drawn. Aim: In the present study we thought to overcome the above limitations by studying a selected group of hemochRometosis patients as a model of iron-induced alteration of insulin sensitivity and or secretion. Methods: In 12 untreated male hemochRometosis patients without metabolic confounders (age 45.5 -3.2 years), we measured during a 30-minute resting period beat-to-beat blood pressure (Finapres), heart rate (EKG), and postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA) via microneurography at a peroneal nerve. Data, which also included HOMA index, were compared with those obtained in 8 age-matched healthy controls. In 4 patients with hemochRometosis, measurements were repeated after phlebotomy-induced iron depletion. Results: Patients with hemochRometosis had blood pressure, heart rate, waist circumference and body mass index values in the normal range and superimposable to those seen in controls. HOMA index was significantly higher than in controls (2.1 -0.2 vs 0.9 -0.2 a.u., p < 0.01). This was the case also for MSNA, whose values were substantially increased in patients with iron overload (62.2 -2.4 vs 47.8 -4.2 bursts 100 heart beats, p < 0.02). Iron depletion was associated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity with an average HOMA reduction of about 20%. This was accompanied by a sustained reduction in MSNA, amounting on average to 30%.",

Introduction: Increased adiposity has been associated with an augmented secretion of aldosterone, independently of angiotensin II, in several experimental investigations. However, clinic studies exploring the relationship between obesity and plasma aldosterone (PAC) yielded conflicting results. Moreover, little is known about the potential influence of gender on this relationship.

Methods: We enrolled 590 hypertensive patients (mean age: 43.8 -12.5 years; 61% males), with a PAC plasma renin activity ratio <400 and free from renal and cardiovascular complications. In all patients, 24-h urinary sodium and potassium excretion, serum sodium and potassium levels, PAC, and plasma renin activity ratio (PRA) were determined, with the subjects kept in the supine position for one hour.

Introduction: Several studies documented that metabolic syndrome (MetS), defined according to the ATPIII or IDF criteria, is associated with an increased left ventricular (LV) mass in essential hypertension. Limited information is available about the different ability of these two diagnostic criteria to identify LV hypertrophy (LVH). Moreover, one of the potential limitations of the MetS concept is the dichotomous nature of the current definitions of MetS, that would limit the power to correctly assess the cardiovascular risk in every patient. Aim: To compare the ability of different definitions of the MetS to identify LVH in a wide group of patients with essential hypertension. Methods: We recruited 724 non-diabetic hypertensive subjects (mean age 45.3 -11.7 years; 63% males), free from cardiovascular complications. In all subjects, routine blood chemistry, echocardiographic examination and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring were performed. We adopted 4 definitions of MetS, two dichotomous (ATPIII e IDF) and two 'quantitative'. Of these latter, one was defined on the basis of the mean value of the sex-specific Z score for every component (MetS Z score) and the other as the average of the percent deviation from the cut-off values used in the ATPIII criteria ('MetS D %').",

Introduction: The diagnosis of the Metabolic Syndrome (MS), according to ATP III, requires three out of five of the following criteria: elevated blood pressure (EP); abdominal circumference (AV) \u2021102 cm in males (M) and 88 in females (F); triglycerides (TG) \u2021150 mg dL; high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL) <40 mg dL in M (<50 in F); fasting blood glucose (G) \u2021100 mg dL. The present study examines the impact of each of these factors on the cardiovascular risk of outpatients affected by MS. Methods: We studied 482 subjects (197 M), with a median age of 54.2 years, performing OGTT with measurement of blood glucose and insulin concentrations at time 0 ' and after two hours (G, G-2h, Ins and Ins-2h). We calculated BMI, AV and as, indexes of insulin resistance and sensitivity, HOMAIR and EISI respectively. We evaluated, as cardiovascular risk factors (CRF), total cholesterol (CT), TG, HDL, LDL and fibrinogen (Fb). Results: The prevalence was 92.3% for EP, 60.2% for TG, 61.1% for HDL, 62.1% for G and 80.7% for AV. Normotensive subjects (n = 37) exhibited significantly lower values for HDL e Fb, while TG was increased compared to hypertensive patients (n = 445). In subjects with normal AV (n = 93), BMI, Ins, Ins-2h, HOMAIR, HDL and FB were significant lower while EISI e TG were higher compared to subjects with increased AV (n = 389). In subjects with normal TG (n = 192), CT and LDL were significant lower, while BMI, AV and HDL were increased as compared to subjects with increased TG (n = 290). In subjects with normal HDL (n = 188), G, CT and LDL were significant increased compared with subjects with low HDL (n = 294).

In this study we examined the risk connected to AH at its onset in both sexes. Methods: We recruited 382 subjects (172 males) aged 44.1-14.3 years, 163 of whom with a newly diagnosed AH. The inclusion condition was normal glucose tolerance at OGTT. None of the subjects studied was affected by hypercolesterolemia and or familiar hypertrigliceridemia.

These alterations are more evident in females: when a woman becomes hypertensive, she discloses profound alterations of her blood lipids together with increased fibrinogen, and she exhibits insulin-resistance if compared to non hypertensive females. Furthermore, it is very significant that fibrinogen is more elevated than in hypertensive males, who, in turn, show values higher than normotensive subjects. These findings contribute to the increased RCV associated to arterial hypertension. Females exhibit an overall risk significantly more pronounced than males. Introduction: Selective X1 blockers have a decreasing reputation in the treatment of hypertension also because metabolic side effects such as increasing adiposity, dyslipidemia, and dysglycemia. Nebivolol (a racemic mixture of D-and L-enantiomers) is a third-generation X1 blocker with vasodilatatory activity mediated through the b3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) because of ADRB3 agonist activity of the L-enantiomer. Available clinic data suggest that nebivolol lacks the adverse metabolic side effects of other b1 blockers. Aim: In this study we examined whether nebivolol was able to induce ADRB3-mediated lipolysis and UCP1 expression, key steps in the use of fatty acids for thermogenesis. Methods: Human visceral mature adipocytes were isolated from omental adipose tissue obtained during elective abdominal surgery. Gene expression of ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3, UCP1 receptors, and adipocyte markers were analysed by RealTime PCR-TaqMan assay. ADRB3 were also investigated by western blotting. The effects of isoproterenol, ADRB3 agonists (CL316243, BRL37344), nebivolol (D and L mixture as well as both pure enantiomers), atenolol, and metoprolol on lipolysis (free glycerol production) and UCP1 expression (evaluated by Real Time PCR-TaqMan assay) were studied in vitro.",

Non-HDL-C was obtained as the difference between TC and HDL-C. Successively, the following lipid ratios were calculated: nonHDL-C HDL-C, LDL-C HDL-C, TG HDL-C. All patients underwent trans-thoracic echocardiogram and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined as left ventricular mass indexed to height2,7 (LVM h2,7) >47 g m 2 in women and >50 g m 2 in men. Ultrasound Doppler evaluation of carotid arteries for the measurement of intima-media thickness (IMT) and urinary spot microalbuminuria (MAU) were also performed.

Introduction: Although the relationship between serum leptin levels (LPT) and progression to endstage kidney disease has been investigated in patients with impaired renal function, the possible association between LPT and decline of renal function has not been evaluated prospectively in a population-based setting. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive role of LPT on the decrease of renal function during an 8 year follow-up period in the participants of the Olivetti Heart Study. Results: After an average follow-up period of 8 years, the incidence of hypertension was 50%. There were significant changes in BMI (+0.5 -0.09 kg m 2 -p < 0.001), SBP (+14.1 -0.75 mmHgp < 0.001), DBP (+8.8 -0.48 mmHg-p < 0.001) and GFR (-3.03 -1.25 mL min-p < 0.02).

Introduction: The metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is considered an emerging risk factor for chronic kidney disease. However, its relationship with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the early phases is controversial. On the one hand, MetSyn predicts the future occurrence of low GFR on the other hand, an association has been described between MetSyn and glomerular hyperfiltration. Methods: The relation between MetSyn and renal function was examined in 669 patients with newly diagnosed, never treated essential hypertension (men 57%, age 49 -10 years, blood pressure 151 93 -16 10 mmHg). We excluded from the study all subjects with overt cardiovascular disease or serum creatinine \u20211. Aim: To compare the expression of genes involved in inflammation (endoplasmic reticulum stress, proinflammatory cytokines) and in other different molecular pathways (pro-angiogenic and antioxidant factors, glucose transport, lipolysis, insulin signalling, adipogenesis) in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of obese subjects with or without metabolic syndrome (MS). Methods: Anthropometric and biochemical parameters of 16 obese women, aged 18-65 years (MS-n = 8; MS+ n = 8), were evaluated. Quantitative mRNA expression of forty-four genes was measured by RT-PCR on VAT and SAT samples obtained from the same subject at the time of bariatric surgery (restrictive or malabsorptive). Results: When considering groups of genes related to specific pathways, such as inflammation (14 genes) and insulin resistance (5 genes), a multivariate analysis showed significant difference (p < 0.05, at least) in relation to the different depots and the presence of MS. Moreover, considering the whole group of patients, we found increased expression of TNF-alpha (+2.4 fold change), JUN (+2.1), ERN1 (+2.0), PRKC~(+2.7), angiotensinogen (+2.4), methallothionein-3 (+5.3) and decreased expression of WISP2 (-3.7) and leptin (-2.4) in VAT as compared to SAT. As compared to MS-, MS+ patients had lower expression of IRS1, both in VAT and SAT, coupled to increased plasma insulin). MS+ patients also showed higher expression of PRKC~in VAT vs.",

Furthermore, the increased CRP gene expression in SAT, but not in VAT of MS+ subjects, suggest that also subcutaneous depot may be involved in the activation of inflammatory processes. Introduction: Metabolic syndrome (MS) is characterized by a peripheral sympathetic activation, as documented by the marked increase in muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA) as well as in systemic norepinephrine spillover reported in this condition. Whether and to what extent, however, cardiac sympathetic drive is also increased is unknown. It is also unknown (1) whether in this condition heart rate represents a faithful marker of the adrenergic overdrive and (2) (2) independent on the central or peripheral type of the obese state. MSNA was significantly related to HOMA index (r = 0.56, p < 0.01), plasma insulin levels (r = 0.42, p < 0.01), body mass index (r = 0.42, p < 0.01) as well as waist circumference (r = 0.33, p < 0.01).

They also show that HR can be regarded as a sensitive marker of the interindividual difference in sympathetic drive. The sensitivity of the approach is limited, however, because HR was unable to reflect the main metabolic and anthropometric abnormalities of the disease. Introduction: Heart rate variability (HRV) represents both an index of the autonomic function and an important prognostic factor in several diseases. An abnormal HRV, characterised by a sympathetic predominance, has been shown in patients with essential hypertension, even in the early stages of the disease and in association with left ventricular hypertrophy. QT interval prolongation has been associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in the general population and in several medical conditions. An abnormal ventricular repolarisation has been described in patients with hypertensive heart disease and a prolonged QT interval is a risk factor for ischemic heart disease in hypertensive subjects. Aim: To evaluate the relation between autonomic nervous system function, measured with heart rate variability (HRV), and QT interval in patients with untreated uncomplicated essential hypertension. Conclusions: The present study shows that, even prior to the development of cardiac hypertensive disease, a prolongation of QTc and a reduced HRV, both markers of cardiovascular risk, coexist in a percentage of patients with untreated essential hypertension. Follow-up studies are warranted to evaluate the potential role of the association of abnormal ventricular repolarisation and reduced HRV in predicting life-threatening arrhythmias and increased mortality rates in hypertensive patients. Introduction: One of the most feared consequences of aging is dementia, a deterioration of acquired cognitive ability that involves not only a diminution of quality of life for the patient, but also a significant impact on families and public expense. Therefore, many are the measures to prevent this deficit. Aim: To evaluate a possible association between cardiovascular risk factors and dementia. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 124 patients (107 females, 17 males), mean age 82 years (range 59-99 ys) referring to Alzheimer's Unit of Pio Albergo Trivulzio of Milan, with a history of hospitalization for at least 2 months between 2006 and 2008. During admission to hospital, patients underwent to thorough clinic, laboratory and instrumental investigation: (1) visit, (2) routine examination, (3) sphygmomanometric blood pressure (3 successive measurements) and heart rate, (4) EKG, (5) CT brain, (6) screening for dementia and assessment of cognitive function based on cognitive test UCLA.",

Introduction: Hypertension induced cerebrovascular damage is a known determinant of age related cognitive decline, but the role of blood pressure control in slowing or reversing cognitive decline is still debated. Aim: To assess the correlation of cognitive decline with blood pressure control and cerebrovascular organ damage. Methods: 60 patients (age 63 -6 years, 41 males) with long-standing (17 -7 years), treated hypertension, attending our hypertension outpatient clinic, underwent 24 hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), intima-media thickness (IMT) measurement by carotid ultrasonography, cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) study by transcranial Doppler, brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological tests. After 6 -1 years follow up, 46 patients (32 males) underwent a second evaluation by ABPM, IMT measurement and neuropsychological tests. Results: Patients with poor blood pressure control (n = 29; ABPM > 125 80 mmHg) had larger white matter lesions, reduced CVR and higher IMT at enrolment. Cognitive performance was unrelated to blood pressure control, but higher diastolic blood pressure was associated with better scores in attention tests. Upon logistic regression, worse performance in executive tests was predicted by higher IMT and worse attention, but not by blood pressure. IMT increased at follow up and it was predicted by diabetes and blood pressure, while attention and executive functions improved (from -0.36 -1.7 to 0.18-1.1, p < 0.05 and from -1.63 -3.4 to -0.27 -4.1, p < 0.05) and memory declined (from 0.25 -2.7 to -0.45 -2.5, p < 0.05).",

Cognitive impairment is related to IMT and attention and unrelated to blood pressure control, at baseline. Better attention is related to higher blood pressure. Both attention and executive functions improve at follow up, despite IMT increase. Short term blood pressure lowering has a negative effect on attention that worsens cognitive performance and masks any correlation between blood pressure control and executive functions. Long-term antihypertensive treatment improves cognitive functions despite IMT progression through adaptation to lower blood pressure levels. Gradual blood pressure lowering and steady blood pressure control are required to prevent hypertension induced cognitive decline. Introduction: In essential hypertension renal sympathetic nervous system activity is increased, with consequences on renal haemodynamics, sodium balance, renin production. Aim: To determine whether an acute administration of the sympathomodulator clonidine can influence renal haemodynamics and SNS activity in essential hypertensive patients. Methods: Thirteen never treated, essential hypertensive patients were included. ECG, non invasive beat-to-beat blood pressure values (BP, Portapres) and muscle sympathetic nervous activity (MSNA, microneurography) were monitored in basal conditions and during a low dose infusion of clonidine (0.5 \u0131`g kg iv in 15 minutes). Venous samples for assessment of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), plasma renin activity (PRA), were obtained before and at the end of recording. Renal intraparenchimal resistive index (RI) was obtained by duplex ultrasound in basal conditions and at the end of the infusion. Introduction: Respiratory periodicity during night at high altitude is frequently reported in patients with cardiovascular disease and it is due to alternance between respiratory center stimulation by hypoxia and its subsequent inhibition by hyperventilation-induced hypocapnea. This respiratory pattern may be influenced also by sex hormones. In fact estrogens and progesterone have been suggested to protect from sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) at sea level. Aim of our study was to explore whether a different ventilatory pattern during night sleep might characterize women and men during acute exposure at high and very high altitude hypoxia. Methods: In 27 healthy subjects, 23 male (mean age 40 years) and 14 female (mean age 36 years) participating in the HIGH altitude Cardiovascular Research project (HIGHCARE), we performed nocturnal portable polysomnography with a new wearable system (MAGIC vest) and with a standard portable system (Embletta) in the following conditions: (1) at sea level (SL), (2) during the first or second night at Namche Bazaar (3500 m above SL) and (3) Conclusions: Under exposure to high and very high altitude hypoxia periodic breathing at night affects more frequently male than female subjects. Females started to present a significant number of central sleep apnea only at the highest hypobaric hypoxia level achieved. This data highlight the presence of a gender-related difference in respiratory center stimulation by hypoxia, which leads to trigger periodic breathing in males earlier and more frequently than in females. This data may also have important implications for pathogenesis and cardiovascular consequences of SRBD at sea level which are reported to be significantly more frequent in males than in females. Introduction: Neurophysiologic, motor expressive and cognitive domains of emotions appear to be central factors in the integration processes between psyche and soma. The Emotional Regulation (ER) consist of the synergetic integration of these domains. As many recent studies pointed out, a deficit in the cognitive processing of the emotion (alexithymia) could lead to a dysregulation of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), that can be considered as one of the causes explaining the relationship between alexithymia and Hypertension. In order to make clear this link, two different models have been proposed: a hypoarousal and a hyperarousal model. Authors have suggested an Autonomic Nervous System hypoactivation, as a reaction to emotional situations, in the alexithymic subjects. On the other hand they proposed an hyperactivation during the physiologic parameter recovery. Aim: On the basis of this model we can hypothesize that alexythymic subjects, compared to non alexythymic subjects, present blood pressure levels: (a) higher on a baseline condition, (b) lower during the report of an emotional story (c) higher during a recovery phase. Methods: Fifty subjects (Man Women = 22 28; mean age = 23.54 -2.38), selected from a larger sample of 300 university students (18-30 age), participated in this study. They were selected on the basis of extreme scores obtained on the 20 items of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. After a baseline phase of 14 minutes, the researcher asked subjects to think, imagine and verbally report an event, coming from the own life and characterized by either positive, negative, or neutral emotional valence. The three verbal reports were generated in three different moment of the experimental setting, in a counter-balanced order. Each stage of narration was followed by a (physiologic) recovery phase, in which the subject rested quietly without speak. Blood pressure was measured through the experiment every 90 seconds.",

Cognitive alterations following high altitude exposure have been variously described in literature for both ecological and simulated conditions. Neuropsychological performance modifications during high altitude exposure include quantitative and qualitative changes, positively correlated with altitude conditions. Aim: To analyze neuropsychological and psychological profiles of normal subjects at sea level and when exposed to high and very high altitude (3500 and 5400 m), the latter conditions being considered as a model of cognition functioning in clinic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or cerebrovascular diseases complicating hypertension, all characterized by poor brain oxygen supply. Results: Our data show quantitative and qualitative differences in cognitive performances between study conditions, with higher scores in normoxia and at 3500 m than at 5400 m. Significant differences and paradigmatic patterns of data emerge on different eye-movements reaction times measures, while a general cognitive slowliness occurred at 5500 m condition. Subjects differed significantly for the presence of depressive anxious symptoms. Neuropsychological and psychological data were correlated with cardiovascular and respiratory parameters. Conclusions: High altitude exposure induces specific cognitive and psychological patterns, as well as peculiar alterations of eye-movements patterns. Computerized neuropsychological assessment seems more sensitive than usual tests to minimal changes observed in cognitive functions under hypoxia conditions. This assessment seem to be ideal in detecting small cognitive changes frequently observed in hypertensive patients affected by mild vascular cognitive impairment (mVCI). These findings have clinic implications for the neuropsychological management of patients affected by diseases associated with hypoxemia.

In absence of the baroreflex other mechanisms act to reduce blood pressure and to increase vagal outflow or decrease cardiac sympathetic outflow to the heart. These mechanisms, nevertheless, are not efficient in buffering blood pressure variability. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) represents a group of non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory arterial diseases frequently incidental and asymptomatic, most commonly involving renal and carotid arteries. The etiology of FMD is not well understood and several mechanisms have been proposed. Pathophysiology and molecular biology of FMD are unknown, and this disease has been listed by the National Organization of Rare Diseases. Angiographic classification includes multiple stenoses and the string-of-beads pattern. There are no treatment protocols for FMD and it may be managed conservatively by antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy as prophylaxis against complications. In this clinic case on a young hypertensive woman with FMD the olmesartan-based treatment improved arterial stenoses of the celiac tripod (CLT) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) after 14 months of therapy (figure). The improvement of the endothelial dysfunction due to selective blockade of the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptors (AT1) and the effect of the AT1blockers on the transforming growth factor-beta pathway, are the possible mechanisms explaining this finding. We hope that this case can be of help to stimulate further investigations about FMD, a disease that has been reported to be the cause of sudden deaths in young people. (table) .

Aim: To evaluate if an exercise program based on periodic controlled fast walking sessions would reduce blood pressure levels in hypertensive subjects already in therapy with antihypertensive drugs, evaluating BP variations through 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Methods: 189 hypertensive subjects were enrolled (101 men and 88 women, mean age 55.7 -10.8 years) already under pharmacological therapy, not suffering from obesity (Body Mass Index <30) and without any pathological condition resulting in reduced mobility. A main inclusion criterion was the evidence of stage I hypertension, according to the Guidelines for Hypertension Treatment of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as an average value obtained with a 24-hour ABPM performed on admission.

In our study, further, ABPM confirms its major role in providing useful information regarding therapeutic follow-up of hypertensive subjects. Introduction: Walking is a very acceptable form of aerobic exercise. Several trials have demonstrated significant benefits of fast walking on the risk factors of cardiovascular disease, particularly for hypertension. Importance of circadian rhythm of blood pressure (BP) in the management of hypertension is well established. In our knowledge only a few studies have assessed the response of hypertensive subjects to regular physical exercise in relation to the nocturnal dip of BP, and none of these has used fast walking protocols in addiction to antihypertensive therapy. Aim: To assess whether physical activity obtained through fast walking might lead to a different reduction of BP levels in hypertensive patients in relation to different circadian profile of BP. Methods: We have enrolled 84 hypertensive patients, with evidence of stage I hypertension and presence of non-dipper nocturnal profile as an average value obtained by two 24-hour ABPM performed at time of admission and after three weeks. All subjects underwent a six weeks physical intervention based on fast walking, three sessions a week. Data obtained have been compared with other collected by our group in a similar analysis already performed in dipper subjects. The two groups resulted matched for age, sex, BMI, mean BP diurnal values before becoming of physical exercise program, antihypertensive therapy. Results: The dipper vs non-dipper analysis shows that there is a significant lower response of nondipper in both SBP (135. 5 -6.4 vs 141.0 -4.4) and DBP (84.8 -8.2 vs 90.1 -2.5) 24-hour data. The lower response of non-dipper hypertensive to exercise therapy can also be seen comparing ABPM data obtained during the three period of day-time. No differences in heart rate have been found between the two groups before and after physical activity. Analyzing ABPM data related to nighttime, after exercise therapy is maintained the difference of BP values between the two groups yet evident on admission due to the different nocturnal profile: neither dipper nor non-dipper show a significant response of nocturnal BP do not resulting in a reduction of both SBP and DBP mean values. At intra-group analysis regarding non-dipper hypertensive patients no significant change was found in 24-hour SBP and DBP values.",

This the consequence, probably, of the different pathophysiologic background on which exercise operate, first of all the level of the systemic vascular resistance, in which a difference degree of the sympathetic nervous system and of the renin-angiotensin system activity appear to be involved. Introduction: New onset diabetes mellitus (NOD) represents an adverse complication in the longterm treatment of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including hypertension, being related to a significant increase in CV morbidity and mortality. Retrospective analyses suggested that the use of drugs that counteract Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) may significantly reduce NOD incidence. The recent results of TRANSCEND and PROFESS trials, however, have questioned this issue. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) in term of NOD incidence in international, randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trials. Methods: We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of all available clinic trials performed with ACE Inhibitors (SOLVD, HOPE, PEACE e DREAM) or ARBs (CHARM, SCOPE, TRANSCEND, PROFESS), published within March 31 2009 (8 trials, n = 63.715 patients, mean age 65.7 -6.3 years), which reported NOD incidence, either as predefined CV endpoint or as drugrelated adverse event, as compared to placebo in different clinic conditions. Results: During a mean follow-up of 3.7 -0.9 years, we recorded 886 10 540 cases in the ACE-Inhibitor group, 740 17 552 cases in the ARB group and 1875 22 880 cases in the placebo group. Antihypertensive therapy based on ACE Inhibitors reduced NOD incidence (OR 0.7288; 95% IC 0.5438, 0.9768), although this reduction did not achieve statistically significance; at the same time, antihypertensive strategy based on ARBs significantly reduced NOD incidence as compared to placebo (OR 0.8395; 95% IC 0.7573, 0.9306) in clinic trials performed in high risk patients, with or without heart failure.

Obese hypertensive patients frequently have a resistant form of hypertension, due to both difficulty in losing weight and inadequate therapeutic approach. In this field, a clinic follow-up may be useful in improving blood pressure (BP) control and understanding underlying clinic factors. Methods: One hundred thirty nine patients aged less than 65 years with essential hypertension and body mass index (BMI) \u202125 kg m 2 underwent basal examination and follow-up visit after 6-12 months. Anthropometric parameters [height, weight, BMI, and waist circumference], BP, labs (renal function, albuminuria, lipids profile; plasma renin and aldosterone), anti-hypertensive therapy (as therapy index and number of drug classes) were evaluated. Results: Systolic BP fell from 145.8 -18.5 to 140.2 -17.8 mmHg (p = 0.001) and diastolic BP from 90.3 -12.1 to 87.8 -10.3 mmHg (p = 0.037), despite substantially unchanged BMI (p = 0.091) but in line with increased therapy (therapy index from 1.22 -0.94 to 1.67 -0.97; number of drug classes from 1.63 -1.19 to 2.08 -1.04). The percentage of subjects obtaining BP control (defined as BP <140 90 mmHg) raised from 24% to 31.7% at follow-up. It was easier to obtain BP control in overweight (51.4%) than obese patients (27.4%), although subjects who became controlled doubled among overweight and triplicate among obese patients. Indeed, anti-hypertensive therapy was increased more consistently in obese than overweight subjects (D therapy index 0.57 -1 vs 0.18 -0.73, p = 0.01; D drug classes 0.58 -1.2 vs 0.17 -0.91, p = 0.027).",

Introduction: Primary Hyperaldosteronism (PA), the most common causes of secondary hypertension, may be associated with hypokalemia, cardiac and renal damage. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is recommended in unilateral PA (APA or UHA), while medical treatment based on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) is indicated in patients with bilateral adrenal (idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia, bilateral APA, GRA) or those unable or unwilling to undergo surgery. MRA treatment appears to be effective for blood pressure lowering and seem to provide blood-independent target organ protection. The most used drugs are Spironolactone, Potassium nate or Canrenone, Eplerenone or less frequently Amiloride. We present here our recent experience in patients with PA. Aim: To evaluate short and middle-term effects of medical and surgical treatment hypertensive state, hormonal parameters and cardiac function in 45 patients with PA referred to tre between 2005 and 2008.",

In adrenalectomized patients there was a significant reduction ma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and normalization of ARR ratio. In medically treated s we observed significant normalization of plasma renin activity (PRA) and consequently zation of ARR. In both there was a significant reduction of LVMI, greater in the 1 year in adrenalectomized patients, subsequently greater in medically treated patients.

Patients were divided according to their age (<50 or \u202150 years old) and to the pharmacological treatment received in their first visit (wash out or monotherapy). All patients included in this study were treated by a physician from the Clinic with only one antihypertensive drug. Results: Patients who were younger than 50 and in wash out at their first visit tended to have a major percentage reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure values if given a R type drug (p = 0.01), once corrected the BMI and the basal blood pressure value. On the contrary, in older people (more than 50 years) V drugs were not related to high efficacy in lowering BP value. Similar results were shown in hypertensive patient not in wash out at their first visit, to whom physicians prescribed a different drug. At the same time, the percentage of patients younger than 50 achieving BP control was significantly higher in those treated with a R drug (42.1% vs 23.9%) and the rate of BP control doubled after correction of the BMI and the basal systolic and diastolic BP values. Conclusions: Also in older people the BP control tended to be more frequent when they were treated with a R drug, even if not significantly. On the one hand, this study supports the idea that R drugs give better results in hypertensive patients younger than 50, which is in accordance with the recommendations of the British Hypertension Society Guidelines and the evidence collected from preview studies. On the other hand, our research doesn't highlight a greater efficacy of V drugs in older people, as was expected. Also in this patients, in fact, drugs that inhibit renin angiotensin system are more effective as first line agents. Introduction: Preliminary data of the Literature suggest that the prevalence of primary aldosteronism (PAL), 5-10% in hypertensive subjects, is even higher than in subjects affected by resistant hypertension (lack of pressure normalization during therapy with three full-dose drugs, included a diuretic). Moreover, although aldosterone is recognized to have an important role in the pathogenesis of the cardiovascular damage, few controlled clinic trials have addressed this topic. Aim: To determine the prevalence of PAL in patients with resistant hypertension, admitted in our Hypertension Unit, and define the possible association with early cardiovascular damage.",

Introduction: Xanthine oxidase is one of the main enzymatic systems producing reactive oxygen species during ischemia-reperfusion; this phenomenon in our protocol is produced by walking exercise on treadmill till the onset of ischemic pain. Aim: To observe if xanthine oxidase inhibition can prevent endothelial dysfunction induced by maximal exercise in patients affected with intermittent claudication or peripheral artery disease (PAD). Methods: 14 patients with PAD with uric acid in normal range and ankle-brachial index between 0.62 and 0.81 underwent endothelial dependent dilation measurements at the brachial artery (EDD) and flux measurement of the femoral artery in the worse leg before and after maximal exercise on treadmill (speed 3.2 km h; slope 10%). Allopurinol 600 mg was administered after the treadmill test and 600 mg the day after, 6 hours before the second treadmill test. Lactate was dosed to confirm the patients reached anaerobic phase. Results: Maximal treadmill acutely reduced EDD (0.406 -0.06 vs 0.442 -0.06 cm; p < 0.005). Allopurinol improved EDD at rest (12.1 -2.3 vs 7.3 -1.2%; p < 0.05) and counteracted the reduction of EDD after maximal treadmill test (-0.92 -0.14 vs -2.5 -0.23%; p < 0.05). Femoral artery flux increased after base exercise (0.702 -0.012 vs 0.675 -0.102 L min; p < 0.05); a further increment in femoral artery flux after exercise was measured during treatment with allopurinol (0.714 -0.011 vs 0.702 -0.012 L min; p < 0.05).

This drug can reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species through inhibition of xanthine oxidase, as a consequence it improves EDD.

In conclusion our study demonstrates that xanthine oxidase increases oxidative stress during maximal claudication and its inhibition improves peripheral haemodynamics, endothelial dysfunction and relieves symptoms. Introduction: Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a multifunctional protein that is ubiquitously expressed and induces transamidation and cross-linking among proteins. This process has an important impact on cell-matrix interactions and vascular remodeling which is modulated by activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Aim: Here we hypothesized that angiotensin II (Ang II) through the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) differentially induces TG2 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from normotensive and hypertensive rats. Methods: Mesenteric artery-derived VSMCs from Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats were studied. Cells were stimulated with Ang II (10-7 M)the AT1R blocker valsartan (Val 10-5 M). TG2 expression was evaluated by immunoblotting.",

Ang II-induced TG2 expression in SHR VSMCs was moderately elevated with respect to WKY VSMCs (+36 -25%, NS). Val significantly reduced Ang II-induced TG2 expression in both WKY and SHR VSMCs. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Ang II positively regulates TG2 expression in rat VSMCs via AT1R.

Aim: To evaluate the relationship between 24-hour arterial pressure and retinal microcirculation vascular diameters. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study on a cohort of 107 hypertensive patients who were tested the same day with a fundus oculi photograph (through a non-mydriatic retinography, Topcon TRC-NW200) and a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (via met model 90207 Spacelabs ABPM).

Only further studies will clarify if this relationship depends on self-regulation of retinal circulation or other mechanisms. Introduction: In constant load exercise sub-AT (in previous incremental test detected) VO 2 reaches steady-state describing exponential curve and its time constant (o\u02c6) measures the speed. \u00d4 correlates with blood flow rapidity and entity in the active muscles microcircle at the beginning of exercise. Since this flow is in the endothelial function domain, o\u02c6reflects the endothelial function efficacy or dysfunction level. Physical training and or cardiovascular therapy speed o\u02c6, which is load dependent, as we previously showed. Consequently, o\u02c6is often normal in young subjects, in trained ones, in mild dysfunction, or for therapy effects. On the other hand, in constant load exercise supra-AT, but sub 2nd ventilatory threshold, VO 2 kinetics are more complex because of another superimposition over the previous, which begins later and increases more slowly, named slow component (sc). Methods: We measure the sc slope, like o\u02c6, and area between two exponentials, either in domain of endothelial function and reduced by physical training and therapy.",

Results: At baseline, we observed significant correlations between M L and serum creatinine (r = 0.32; p = 0.013), GFR (r = -0.26; p = 0.047), BUN (r = 0.37; p = 0.009), systolic (r = 0.45, p < 0.001), diastolic (r = 0.29, p = 0.02), mean blood pressure (r = 0.38, p = 0.002) and pulse pressure (r = 0.40, p = 0.002). In addition, we observed significant correlations between M L and creatinine at follow up (r = 0.57; p < 0.001), percentage changes in serum creatinine (r = 0.46; p < 0.001), GFR at follow up (r = -0.43; p < 0.001); percentage changes in GFR (as ml min r = -0.33; p = 0.008), as well as yearly changes (r = -0.34, p = 0.007), BUN at follow up, (r = 0.55; p < 0.001), as well as uric acid at follow up (r = 0.35; p = 0.026). A multivariate analysis in which all common cardiovascular risk factors were included, showed that M L is the most potent predictor of changes in renal function. Conclusions: Our data suggest that structural alterations of subcutaneous small resistance arteries (which may be present also in other vascular beds), may predict the time-course of changes of renal function during a follow-up period of about 9 years.

The most utilized questionnaire for evaluating the alexithymia is the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. The last version of this instrument, including 20 items (TAS-20), presents a good psychometric properties, but it lost in part his sensibility for evaluating the emotional perception. Recently, the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire (BVAQ) was developed in order to evaluate two big-factors: an affective dimension of emotions, related to the emotional perception, and a cognitive dimension of emotions, related to the emotional elaboration. Aim: To evaluate if Hypertensive people following a PAT have higher deficit in both affective and cognitive dimensions of emotions compared to Hypertensive people who do not follow a PAT. Methods: In this study 97 patients participated (Man Woman = 44 53; mean age = 54.46 -12.76) affected by Essential Hypertension, who completed the Italian version of the BVAQ. Results: An ANCOVA, considering as independent factor the PAT (yes no), the age as covariate, and the BVAQ scores as dependent variables",

Methods: In 120 hypertensive patients (HT) with stage 1-4 chronic kidney disease and in 50 healthy Controls we assessed IMT and plasma levels of Fetuin A, endothelin 1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-6, 8ISOPG were assayed. Subsequently, HT were divided on the basis of eGFR >90 mL min 1.73 m 2 . Results: Overall HT showed significantly higher plasma levels of IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, ET-1, 8isopg (p < 0.001 respectively) than Controls, whereas Fetuin A plasma levels were significantly lower (p < 0.001)",

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is currently discussed as a possible mediator of inflammation. VEGF is one of the most potent angiogenic factors known and is thought to function as a endogenous regulator of endothelial integrity. Animal studies have revealed that VEGF promotes endothelial regeneration and induces migration and activation of monocyte through induction of chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. However, there is still a debate over the vascuoloprotective vs pro-inflammatory effect of VEGF. Methods: We performed this study to investigate the hypothesis that VEGF and MCP-1 play a role as inflammatory mediators in essential hypertension. Twenty never treated patients with mild hypertension and 20 healthy controls were examined",

Conclusions: Carotid-femoral PWV and AIx75 increase acutely under hypobaric hypoxia at altitude and return almost completely to baseline values after return to SL. After several days permanence at very high altitude CF-PWV remained elevated, while AIx75 returned to SL values. Our results thus suggest that while arterial stiffness remains elevated under prolonged exposure to hypoxia at very high altitude, the concomitant reduction in AIx may reflect an adaptive response in terms of peripheral resistances",

A complete normalization of small resistance artery structure was also demonstrated in hypertensive patients, after therapy with dihydropiridinic calcium antagonists, as well as with drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system. No improvement of vascular structure was observed, despite similar hemodynamic effects, after treatment with alpha-blockers or diuretics. However, no data are presently available about the effects of a combination between an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker.

Results: The late PC-mediated inhibition of caspase-3-cleavage induced by 12 hours of hypoxia was abolished by cells pretreatment with a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-cysteine), whereas it was unaffected by inhibition of NO-production (L-NAME+1400W). BAECs pretreatment with NOC-12 (a long term NO-donor) did not prevent the caspase-3-cleavage induced by 12 hours of hypoxia. To further exclude a role of iNOS and eNOS in late PC-induced cell protection, we assessed caspase-3-cleavage in late PC after pretreatment with 1400 W and silencing of eNOS expression. Both treatments did not affect late PC cytoprotective effect. Conclusions: Our data show that late PC-induced cytoprotection in BAECs is mediated by ROS production, but not by NO synthesis. 13.33 Platelet and Endothelial Activation and Progression of Cognitive",

Borghi S.Orsola-Malpighi-Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, Bologna, ItalyIntroduction: M-mode echocardiography in the evaluation of left ventricular (LV) mass (M) can be performed only in a limited number of subjects because of technical difficulty in obtaining ultrasonic beam (UB) correct alignment (really perpendicular to left ventricular structures) and a good quality of the image. This last, on the contrary, is more often available with a non optimal UB alignment, by which sometimes LV quantitative assessment is performed. Bidimensional long axis (B) LV walls and dimensions measurement gives LVM evaluation similar to the M-mode one, when the last one is not technically available. Aim: To assess in how many patients (pts) B-mode long axis and M-mode quantitative LV evaluation can be performed, in how many LV measurement can be performed with optimal alignment of UB (L-opt) and in how many it can be performed only with a non optimal alignment of UB (LQ), however excluding an UB LV structures angle >1101 or a not adequately circular short axis image. Methods: We therefore considered 4 kinds of measurements: 1 B and 3 M-mode guided by LQ, short axis (T), or L-opt. In one month we evaluated by echocardiography 148 consecutive subjects (63 M, 85 F, mean age 67.7 years, range 14-92, 58% hypertensive patients), assessing LV end diastolic walls thickness and internal diameter. M-mode evaluation of LV structure was not possible in 32 patients (No M-mode), of which 18 did not consent any quantitative evaluation at all. Results: Number and characteristics of patients in each group are represented in the table ( * p < 0.05 vs LQ, B, No M-mode; ** p < 0.05 vs LQ, B, T, L-opt).",

Aim: To evaluate the predictive role of habitual daily physical activity (PA) on blood pressure (BP), anthropometric indices and adiponectin plasma levels in a selected sample of the Olivetti Heart Study (OHS) population. Methods: We used the OHS database of 1994-95 and 2002-04 examinations. The study population was made of 303 men (age 48.6 -5.9 years in 1994, M -SD), who did not practice any PA in 1994, for whom plasma adiponectin and information about PA (walking or cycling, investigated by a standardized questionnaire) were available in both occasions. The sample was stratified into 3 subgroups with reference to PA reported at the 2002-04 follow-up examination (group A: PA < 15 min day (n = 113), group B: 15C: PA > 30 (n = 105). Results: The 3 groups were not different for principal characteristics at baseline, while, in 2002-04 follow-up, there was a significantly difference for changes (D) of BMI (A: 0.69 -1.78, B: 0.23 -1.9, C: 0.13 -1.6 kg m 2 ; p = 0.04) and D adiponectin (A: 1.76 -2.6, B: 2.07 -2.4, C: 2.74 -3.0 mcg mL; p = 0.027). BP difference was significantly and directly associated to (AMP;)DELTA; BMI, after adjustment of antihypertensive therapy (b = 2.15, p < 0.001). At the multivariate regression analysis, PA is a significant and independent predictor of D adiponectin, over 8 years (adjusted for age, BMI difference, BP difference and basal adiponectin -b = 0.91, p = 0.014); besides D adiponectin, among the three groups, was significantly different (A: 1.81 -0.25, B: 2.02 -0.28, C: 2.72 -0.26 mcg mL; p = 0.036), after adjustment for the same confounder factors. Conclusions: This study shows that daily physical activity is associated with higher adiponectin level 8 years later, independently of basal adiponectin plasma levels, BMI and blood pressure. 10.16 Plasma Adiponectin Levels, Body Mass Index and Cornell Voltage-Duration Product in a Sample of Adult Male Population -Olivetti Heart Study L.

Fortunati, L. Angelini, P. Dess\u00ec-Fulgheri and A. Rappelli Clinica di Medicina Interna, Univ. Politec. Marche, Ancona, ItalyIntroduction: Overweight and obesity influence blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass (LVM). It is unclear whether the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects BP and echocardiographic parameters in overweight obese hypertensive patients. Methods: We studied 365 overweight obese hypertensive patients (age \u00a365 years) presenting to our Centre for BP control-related problems. Patients who underwent recent changes of antihypertensive therapy were excluded. MetS was defined according to NCEP III ATP with AHA modifications. Left atrium diameter (LAD), ejection fraction (EF), relative wall thickness (RWT) and LVM, indexed by either body surface area (LVMi) or height 2.7 (LVM h 2.7) were evaluated by echocardiography. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined as LVMi \u2021125 g m 2 for males and \u2021110 g m 2 for females and LVM h2.7 \u202149.2 g m2.7 for males and \u202146.7 g m2.7 for females. Concentric remodeling was defined as RWT \u20210.42. Results: Two hundred and forty patients (65.8%) had MetS. Hypertensive patients with MetS had significantly higher systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean BP (MBP) and BMI than those without MetS. No difference in LVMi was found between patients with or without MetS. Hypertensive patients with MetS had higher LAD (40.3 -5.8 vs 38.9 -6 cm; p = 0.033) and LVM h2.7 (58.6 -15.5 vs 53.7 -14.3 g m2.7; p = 0.012), as well as reduced EF than those without MetS. Hypertensive patients with MetS have a near 2-fold higher risk to have LVH h2.7 (unadjusted OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.12, 2.81; p = 0.01). The OR changed to 1.6 when the model was adjusted by age and MBP (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.01, 2.56; p = 0.05). Similarly, patients with MetS had a 2-fold higher risk to have concentric remodeling (OR 1.95 95% CI 1.16, 3.29, p = 0.01) also when the model was adjusted by age, sex, and MBP (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.11, 3.22; p = 0.02). MetS lost its independent effect when BMI was included in the model. Conclusions: MetS influences BP levels, LVM and cardiac dimensions and remodeling. MetS maintains its role of risk factor for LVH and concentric LV remodeling independently of age, sex and MBP, making it a useful predictor of target organ damage in clinic practice. However, MetS loses its independent effect when BMI or obesity are taken into account, suggesting that BP and cardiac remodeling are mainly driven by the degree of adiposity.5.15 Early Left Ventricular Remodeling in Normotensive MaleOffspring of Essential Hypertensive Parents Independent of Blood Pressure G.

Aim: To evaluate the appropriateness of LVM in a cohort of untreated hypertensive patients according to the presence of obesity and MS. In addition, to evaluate in these patients the relation between the appropriateness of LVM and levels of high sensitivity c-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation. Methods: 176 untreated hypertensive patients underwent their first evaluation for hypertension. In all subjects routine blood chemistry including CRP, echocardiographic examination (conventional and TDI) and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring were performed. Inappropriate LVM (ILVM) was defined as observed predicted ratio (OPR) of LVM >128%. On the basis of the presence of obesity (defined as BMI> 30 Kg m 2 ) and ATPIII criteria for MS, the population was divided in 4 groups: Obese with MS displayed an higher prevalence of LVH (63.6% vs 57.7%, p < 0.001) and ILVM (59.1% vs 38.5%, p < 0.01), as compared with subjects without MS; similarly, higher values of LVH (42.9% vs 19.8%, p < 0.001) and ILVM (19% vs 15.1%, p < 0.001) were found among non obese with MS than without MS.

Methods: We evaluated 703 hypertensive patients (66 + 7 years; 45% women) with ECG-LV hypertrophy enrolled in the LIFE echo-substudy. Only patients free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and with baseline ejection fraction (EF) >55% were included. Echocardiographic exams were performed annually for 5 years during antihypertensive treatment. Development of reduced systolic function was defined as incident EF<50%. Results: Main findings of our study are shown in the table. During a mean follow up of 4.8 + 1 years, 37 patients developed reduced EF without an intercurrent myocardial infarction (5.3%). Patients who developed reduced EF were more often men (p < 0.05). In analysis of covariance, patients who developed reduced EF had greater baseline LV diameter and LV mass, lower mean EF (all p < 0.05), and similar diastolic function indices. As shown in the table below, at last available exam before EF reduction, independently of covariates, patients with reduced EF showed a significant increase in LA size, LV diameter, end-systolic stress and mitral E A ratio, as compared to those who did not develop reduced EF (all p < 0.05). In time-varying Cox regression analysis, controlling for baseline EF, predictors of developing reduced EF were higher intreatment LV diameter (HR = 5.19; 95% CI: 2.58, 10.41; p < 0.001) and higher in-treatment mitral E A ratio (HR = 2.37; 95% CI: 1.58, 3.56; p < 0.001).Conclusions:We provide the first evidence of significant changes in cardiac geometry and function preceding incident reduced EF, in the absence of intercurrent MI, in treated hypertensive patients. Higher in-treatment LV diameter and mitral E A ratio are the strongest echocardiographic predictors of reduced EF.5.23 Cardiac ModificationsRelated to Incident Heart Failure in Treated Hypertensive Patients: the LIFE Echo Substudy M.

Little is known on whether acute HF is associated with significant variations in echocardiographic parameters, nor whether these variations are independent of intercurrent myocardial infarction (MI).Methods:We evaluated 926 hypertensive patients (66 + 7 years; 45% women) with ECG-LV hypertrophy enrolled in the LIFE echo-substudy, without history of heart failure. Echocardiographic exams were performed annually for 5 years during anti-hypertensive treatment. Data from baseline examination, last examination before HF, and first examination after HF event are reported. Results: During follow-up, 23 patients developed HF (2.5% of study population; 14 women) and 38 MI events occurred. Patients who developed HF were older (72 vs 54 years), had higher baseline heart rate (76 vs 67 bpm) and higher rate of pre-existing ischemic heart disease (47.8% vs 14.5%; all p < 0.01), as compared to patients that did not develop HF. Higher rate of intercurrent MI was observed in patients who subsequently developed HF (13.2% vs. 2% in non-HF; p = 0.002). Echocardiographic data of patients that developed HF during the study are displayed in the table, dichotomized by the presence (N = 5) or absence (N = 17) of incident MI.",

All these competences are strictly related to the emotional area. Based on studies highlighted how people affected by Hypertension show a deficit in the emotional elaboration (Alexithymia). Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of a psychological intervention for Promoting Emotional Regulation Skills (PERS) in both reducing the level of blood pressure and improving the supervision of health in patients affected by hypertension. Methods: Ninety patients with high blood pressure, selected at the Center for the cure of hypertension in the 1st Medical Clinic Umberto 1 in Rome, participated in this study. Five Groups of 12 people were part of the PERS groups and 30 people were included in a waiting list, that formed the control groups. The two types of groups were homogeneous for the consumption of hypertensive drugs and balanced for gender and alexithymia level. The medical and psychological history has been assessed after an evaluation of psychological (Alexithymia e Locus of control health) and physiological (Measuring of high blood pressure) characteristics before and after the treatment and upon a follow up at three months. The PERS groups participated to 12 sessions of 2 hours each on a weekly basis. Within the PERS groups, game activities took place, focused on some emotional aspects and on the elaboration of emotional experiences of the day life. At the end of the treatment the patients have been interviewed for plain how to use, in the daily life, the emotional competences developed within the PERS groups. Results: Main results showed in the PERS groups, compared to the control group, a reduction of pressure parameters (systolic p < 0.0004 and diastolic p < 0.000001) and an increase in health Locus of control (p < 0.02). Conclusions: Although these are just preliminary results, they seem to demonstrate that a psychological intervention can facilitate the development of emotional competences, that helps people to improve physical health by reducing the level of blood pressure.11.9 Alexithymia and Hypertension: the Role of the Affective Factors and Cognitive Elaboration 11.11 Changes in Neuropsychological and Psychological Performance at High Altitude: Data from the HIGHCARE2008 Project B.

Aim: To highlight changes in cognitive profile and pre-clinic vascular damage in mild hypertensive patients, poorly controlled by antihypertensive therapy. Methods: As assessed by medical visit (off) and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (day-night), 20 normotensives (NTN), 63 hypertensive patients with adequately (AC-HTN) and 61 with inadequately (UC-HTN) lowered blood pressure, with similar age, sex, metabolic assessment and history of hypertension (156 -2 90 -2 vs 154 -1 88 -3 mmHg, n.s.) underwent a neuropsychological evaluation by tests for executive functions (FAB, STROOP), selective attention (MATRIX), verbal short memory (DIGITSPAN), working memory or ability of monitoring of learned information (SPANBACK) and lexical fluency (FAS). The SBPoff-day% served as surrogate measure of 'white-coat effect' (WCeff) and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was used as index of vascular damage. Results: Differences in hemodynamic and cognitive functions occurred, as shown in the table (data are expressed as mean -SE: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs NTN; 4 p < 0.05, 44 p < 0.01, 444 p < 0.001 vs AC-HTN). Pearson analysis, adjusted for smoke, age, IMT, WCeff, metabolic and anthropometric assessment, showed, in hypertensive patients, an inverse association between with SBPoff and FAB (-0.329 *** ), MATRIX (-0.324 *** ) and FAS (-0.304 *** ).",

After 6 weeks, in patients uncontrolled (PAD > 90 mmHg e or PAS > 140 mmHg) was added hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg in group R and increased barnidipina dosage at barnidipina 20 mg day in group R + B. Main goal of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of both treatments on 24 hours blood pressure monitoring. Results: In this preliminary analysis are showed the results of first 12 weeks treatment in first 30 enrolled patients.(15 R e 15 R + B). Average age of patients was 54 -13 years (60% M). After 6 weeks of therapy, in group R, in 4 patients with blood pressure values uncontrolled was added hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, in group A, in 1 patient barnidipina dose was doubled at 20 mg die.

The retrospective analysis evaluated all subjects with at least one prescription refill (n. 57 051) of antihypertensive drugs: diuretics (D) (n. 8647), beta-blockers (BB) (n. 9678), calcium channel-blockers (CCB) (n. 7153), ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) (n. 19 819), angiotensin II antagonists (ARB) (n. 10 197), or others (n. 1557). All evaluated patients had a 12-months follow-up period starting from the date of first prescription refill. 'Persistent' patients were defined those with at least one antihypertensive prescription refill during the last 3 months of observation and a mean daily dose equal or higher than 80% of the defined daily dose. All evaluated patients were defined as diabetics, hypercholesterolemics and 'cardiopathics' according to antidiabetic, lipid-lowering or 'cardiac' therapy prescription refills. The mean age was 56.6 -15 years and male percentage was 45.1%. Persistence at 1 year was very low, lowest with D and highest with ARB. Results: The main findings of our study are shown in the table. Not-persistence risk, compared to ARBs (RR = 1.00), was 1.5 for ACE-I, 1.88 for CCB, 3.64 for BB, 3.69 for others and 7.71 for D. Higher age(61.8 -12.6 vs 57.4 -16.5), higher diabetes prevalence (7.7 vs 4.2%) and dyslipidemia (6.0 vs 4.6%) was observed in persistent patients compared to not persistent patients.12.4 BloodPressure Lowering Efficacy of 'Fast Walking' Physical Training Programme in Treated Hypertensive Patients D. di Raimondo, A.

Methods: We evaluated 47 elderly subjects (M 21, F 26, mean age 71 + 5) with mild-moderate hypertension. All subjects were administered a Telmisartan 80 mg monotherapy and were studied for 12 months. Those who still did not have controlled blood pressure after 4 weeks were also prescribed a 80 mg dose of Telmisartan or were associated Idroclorotiazide or Ramipril. Design of the study included before and after follow-up:1. measurement of blood pressure; 2. ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM); 3. colordoppler echocardiogram; 4. epiaortic colordoppler. Blood pressure measurement resulted from average of 3 measurements taken at 5 minutes intervals and every four weeks. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was assessed through the following criteria: MVSI >125 110 gr m 2 ; MVS h >51 47 gr h 2.7. Thickness of intima-media carotid was assessed through IM >1.0 <1.3 mm. Prevalence of LVS was found in 73% subjects. In the same group the mean thickness of carotid wall was 2.4 + 1.4 mm. Results: After 4 weeks:1. 11 subjects maintained the same dose of 80 mg Telmisartan; 2. 14 subjects assumed a 160 mg dose of Telmisartan; 3. 13 subjects were associated Idroclorotiazide 12.5 mg; 4. 9 subjects were associated Ramipril 5 mg. There were non significant differences between the two genders. Before and after the follow-up period subjects treated with Telmisartan showed: Conclusions: Measurement obtained with the Carotid Studio showed good agreement with those by the ArtLab and a similar reproducibility. Hence, although it is common opinion that B-mode based devices have lower precision than the RF based ones, these data suggest that the Carotid Studio, measuring from standard ultrasound scans, can be a suitable device for the measurement of IMT and arterial stiffness parameters in clinic studies. Introduction: Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery is the most commonly used method to assess endothelial function. A reduced FMD is associated with major cardiovascular risk factors and is an independent predictor of events. Despite the large effort to standardize the methodology, FMD evaluation is still characterized by problems of reproducibility and reliability. Aim: To standardize the procedure for FMD assessment in different Units and evaluate FMD variability over time in healthy volunteers. Methods: 101 healthy volunteers (age 20-60 years) were recruited in 6 Italyn Hypertension Units. FMD was assessed as dilation of the brachial artery secondary to 5 minutes forearm ischemia by trained operators using a clamp to held the ultrasound probe. Sequences of B-mode images of the brachial artery were VCR recorded for baseline FMD (time 0) and repeated 1 hour after baseline maintaining the probe in the same position (time 1) and 1 month apart (time 2). Endothelium independent vasodilation to glyceryl trinitrate (25 mcg, sublingual) was also evaluated at time 0 and 2. FMD and response to GTN were measured blindly as percentage brachial artery diameter changes by an automatic edge detection system (FMD Studio, Institute of Clinic Physiology, CNR, Pisa) in the coordinating Centre. The intra-(time 0 vs 1) and inter-session (time 0 vs 2) coefficients of variation were calculated for the 6 different research units and overall to assess FMD and GTN variability over time.Results: All recordings were suitable for analysis. FMD was 7.4 -3.1% at time 0, 7.2 -3.3% at time 1 and 7.4 -2.9% at time 2. Overall, the intra-session FMD variability was 9.3 -10.1% ranging from 6.6% to 10.1% in the different Centres. Inter-session FMD variability was 13.9 -11.8%, ranging from 11.0% to 16.1% in the different Centres. GTN response was 12.8 -4.8% at time 0 and 12.6 -4.2% at time 2. Overall inter-session variability of GTN response was 15.9 -9.8%, ranging from 10.1% to 22.3%.Conclusions: This multicenter study shows a similar variability in measuring FMD 1 month apart as compared 1 hour apart, an reliable index of intrinsic variability of endothelial response. Thus, a standardized procedure, including operator training, defined experimental settings and automatic brachial artery measurements, can ensure an adequate FMD reproducibility over time for the for the assessment of endothelial function in clinic studies.
