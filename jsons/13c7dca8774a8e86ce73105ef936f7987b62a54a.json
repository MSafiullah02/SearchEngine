In the U.S., an early analysis of the first 4,226 cases from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of March 16, 2020 , revealed estimated rates of hospitalization (20.7-31 .4%), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (4.9-11.5%), and case fatality (1.8-3.4%). 4 More recent data from a cohort of 5700 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 within a large healthcare system in New York City revealed common comorbidities including hypertension (56.6%), obesity (41.7%), and diabetes (33.8%), and reported that 373 (14.2%) of patients required treatment in the intensive care unit, and 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, in whom the mortality was 88.1% (282/320)]. 5 ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II), believed to be the target entry receptor for SARS-coV2, is abundantly expressed in gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia, thereby implicating ACE2 as a vehicle for possible fecal-oral transmission. 6 Furthermore, ACE2 receptors may be expressed in hepatic cholangiocytes 7 and hepatocytes 8 , potentially permitting direct infection of hepatic cells.",

An additional 10 studies were identified with potentially overlapping cohorts based on hospital name, but these were included if they provided unique information about a specific symptom (e.g., diarrhea at initial presentation when the larger cohort did not clearly state that it was at initial presentation). Based on our comprehensive selection process, we believe that the included 47 studies reported data on 10,890 unique COVID-19 patients. The majority of studies (70%) in our analysis were from China; these were selected out of 118 reports published or pre-published from China. See Supplement Figure 2 .

Also, many of the studies in this analysis did not report on how many patients had underlying liver disease and if these patients were at an elevated risk of having increased LFTs in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, diagnostic evaluation of abnormal LFTs on admission was not routinely performed, such as testing for viral hepatitis or other etiologies. The available studies suggest that abnormal LFTs are more commonly attributable to secondary effects (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome, cytokine storm, ischemic hepatitis/shock, sepsis, drug hepatotoxicity) than primary virus-mediated hepatocellular injury. 7, 9, 80 However, liver histopathology from patients with COVID-19 have revealed mild lobular and portal inflammation and microvesicular steatosis suggestive of either virally mediated or drug-induced liver injury. 81 In addition, some studies have revealed that abnormal LFTs at hospital admission may be associated with a higher risk for severe COVID-19 (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.19-6.3). 9 Therefore, we advise checking baseline LFTs in all patients on admission and monitoring of LFTs throughout the hospitalization, particularly in patients undergoing drug therapy for COVID-19 associated with potential hepatotoxicity.

The majority of studies reported on cohorts of patients based on inclusion dates and did not specify if these were consecutive patients. There was an inconsistent assessment of symptoms and/or laboratory tests with missing data, and none of the studies reported if patients were systematically evaluated for GI symptoms on admission. Most studies did not report on the duration of the GI symptoms preceding the presentation. When GI symptoms were reported, it was difficult to discern if these were isolated symptoms or if patients had also had concurrent typical COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., fever cough, SOB). LFTs were mostly reported as the mean/median value of the entire cohort and without cut-off values for the institution. Many of the studies did not report on underlying chronic GI or liver diseases. There was a lot of heterogeneity in our pooled estimates that could not be explained by our subgroup analysis based on geographic location. Lastly, the data on prognosis was especially difficult to analyze due to insufficient follow up of the patients (the majority of the patients were still hospitalized at the time of publication). Finally, there was no stratification of GI-related symptoms and severity of COVID-19 or patient important outcomes, such as need for ICU or survival.",

Due to concerns about overlapping cohorts, we used a hierarchical framework to identify unique cohorts based on the number of patients and the hospitals to analyze the prevalence of GI and liver symptoms. It is possible that we excluded relevant studies that provided more granularity regarding the GI and liver manifestations or had more rigorous methodology which may lead to an over or underestimation of the pooled effect estimates. However, we have high confidence that we were able to eliminate the counting of some patients in more than one report by using our selection framework, unless they were transferred from one hospital to another. An important strength of this study is the appropriate statistical analysis used to pool proportions. We also reviewed grey literature from pre-publication repositories which allowed us to include a large number of studies that have not been published yet, with data from a total of 10,890 unique COVID-19 patients being included in this work. Lastly, we tried to narratively describe studies that informed us on (i) the type of diarrhea symptoms (ii) whether diarrhea was reported as the only presenting symptom or (iii) diarrhea as the initial symptom that preceded other symptoms. Based on our study selection process, we may have missed studies, including smaller case series that reported on this information, and studies that were published after our inclusion period, in light of the exponential number of studies in press, under review, and on pre-print servers.",

The study by Cholankeril et al. reported that 26/65 (40%) patients had abnormal liver enzymes and 22 of them had normal baseline liver enzymes.70 None of the remaining studies provided any information regarding the status of LFTs prior to the infection. One study by Fu H et al. reported summary statistics (median and IQR) of LFTs for 23 patients on admission and discharge with clinically important changes. However, they did not provide the number of patients who presented with normal or abnormal LFTs and how many of them improved or worsened.65 None of the included studies reported the work-up of LFTs in the settings of COVID-19 or assessed if they were related to alternative etiologies, especially medications. Thirteen studies reported on the association between the presence of liver injury at presentation and severity of disease or outcomes. Most of them reported the results of univariate analyses. The study by Hajifathalian et al. reported the results of multivariate analyses that included multiple variables and showed liver injury at presentation was associated with high risk for admission as well as higher risk of ICU admission and/or death as a composite outcome.63 See Supplement Figures 9-11. Rationale for Best Practice Statements 1. In outpatients with new onset diarrhea, (i) ascertain information about high risk contact exposure (ii) obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell (iii) obtain a thorough history for other Gl symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.2. In outpatients with new onset Gl symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19 as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days. In a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered.3. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea) including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity.",
