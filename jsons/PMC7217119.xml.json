One drug can stimulate or inhibit its own CYP isoenzyme or other isoenzymes with further influencing the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized with the same isoenzyme (Zhang et al., 2009).

The most prominent evidences are three phase 3 clinical trials that used CQ during glioblastoma multiform with carmustin or temozolomide and showed positive results with added CQ. There are other phase 1-2 trials of addition the CQ to other chemotherapy regimens with hopeful results (Manic et al., 2014).Terminal elimination half-life of CQ is about 1-2 months and of 50 days for HCQ (Verbaanderd et al., 2017).",

The elimination half-life is about 2-5.5 hours with a protein binding of 54% in plasma and metabolized by aldehyde oxidase (AO) and xanthine oxidase to its metabolite, T705M1, in liver and excreted to urine.(Du and Chen, 2020) Dose adjustment based on hepatic impairment is not needed however there is not enough humanized study about it (Du and Chen, 2020). The proposed dose for COVID-19 is the loading dose of 3200 mg on day 1 and maintenance dose of 1200 mg on day2-14.(Du and Chen, 2020) Main side effects of favipiravir include mild to moderate diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes, testicular toxicity, increased blood uric acid and decrease in neutrophil count (2011). The rate of Q-T prolongation is low (8%) (2011). There is limited clinical data about DDIs and metabolism of favipiravir. In vivo study showed inhibitory effect of favipiravir on CYP2C8 isoenzyme (2011). As well as, other study revealed favipiravir inhibits AO (Du and Chen, 2020). So, more caution was necessary when used AO inhibitors such as tamoxifen or CYP2C8 substrates like paclitaxel with favipiravir (2011).",

It is used by oral or subcutaneous route and metabolized in liver by CYP3A4 isoenzyme(Canga et al., 2008; Zeng et al., 1998). Ivermectin binds to plasma protein by rate of 93% and is mainly excreted in feces.(Klotz et al., 1990). Its half-life based on administration route is around 12-20 hours (Canga et al., 2008). The absorption, distribution and elimination of ivermectin is dependent on P-glycoprotein, on the other hand, it is a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (M\u00e9nez et al., 2012). The main interactions of this drug are caused by its effects on P-glycoprotein. Ivermectin may change the p-glycoprotein ABCB1 substrate(M\u00e9nez et al., 2012). The most reported side effects are reported in the context of its use an antiparasitic drug as the result of immunologic response to parasite, including skin rash, fever, headache, nausea and dizziness (Juarez et al., 2018). Drug interaction of Ivermectin and chemotherapy agents is an important issue both in treatment of cancer or COVID-19 (Canga et al., 2008).",

Increasing the level of IL-6 is the consequence of blocking IL-6 receptors by TCZ. Elevated IL-6 reduces CYP450 activity, TCZ may reverse this reduced activity of CYPA50. This issue must be kept in mind when we want to administer TCZ with other agents that metabolized by CYP450.(Schmitt et al., 2011) TCZ is an immunosuppressive agent; therefore, there is a concern toward its administration in cancer patients who are already immunosuppressed as the result of chemotherapy (26). It should also be noted that due to the long half-life of TCZ monitoring of this interaction may be necessary for 1 to 2 months after the discontinuation of TCZ (Roche Pharma, 2013).",
