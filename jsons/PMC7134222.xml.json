However, the South African healthcare system is fraught with challenges, some of the major ones include the inadequacy of human and equipment resources [1], difficulties in synergizing and collaborating policies and lack of legislative commitment to improving the public health sector [2]. According to the World Health Organization, the shortage of healthcare workers is a major challenge in a country\u2019s ability to overhaul its healthcare system and ultimately, achieve universal healthcare coverage [2]. Given South Africa\u2019s limited resources, the need for cost-effective strategies is paramount.

In addition, it is noted that CHWs are considered a dependable vehicle to provide quality contextual health services both in urban and rural settings within the South African context [5]. The South African government has introduced various initiatives to address the historic disparate healthcare system [1]. One such initiative is the National Development Plan for 2030 that involves building human resources to ensure shared competencies for the health system as part of its plan of action. Part of this plan includes a goal of employing and training between 700 000 and 1.3 million CHWs to implement community-based primary healthcare [5]. Regardless of the effort needed to reach this goal quantitively, it can be argued that the potential benefits of CHWs have not to be realized. This can be attributed to a misalignment in national policies and standards to their work practices, and the significant barriers in training CHWs to function at the expected level of competence [2, 6].",

Consequently, the utilization of technology as a viable solution for CHWs has steadily gained significant popularity. Despite this, various authors\u2019 calls for research specifically focused on investigating mHealth implementation for CHWS in low-and-medium-income countries (LMICs). The definition of LMICs adopted was according to the World Bank classification with the study focusing more on the Sub-Saharan region [8]. Winters et al.

The best-fit framework synthesis is defined in [12] as \u201ca means to test, reinforce and build on an existing model, conceived for a potentially different but relevant population\u201d. This method involves creating or employing a framework with priori themes and using it to code the data obtained from the relevant studies as a means to produce a rapid and pragmatic form of synthesis [12]. It advises the use of criteria; one for identifying the models and theories to generate a priori framework, and one for populating the scoping review of primary qualitative research studies. In this study, only one set of the literature search and a study selection was considered for the scoping review as the socio-technical system (STS) framework was used as a priori framework.

The six interrelated elements used are people, infrastructures, goals, technologies, culture, and processes embedded within an external environment [13].

However, the narrative presented in the previous studies alludes there is unbalanced attention on the impact of the complex and diverse context-specific nature within which CHWs work and live in [17]. As a result, De Neve et al. [17] propose the need for countries to develop coherent and context-specific approaches to ensure optimal performance by CHWs through the consideration of the broader context, including demographic, socioeconomic, political, legislative, ecological, sociocultural, and technological factors contributing towards facilitating or inhibiting the success of many CHWs initiatives [18, 19]. Some of the solutions to achieve what is postulated in the studies include coordinating the health system and community system to prioritize factors that inhibit or facilitate the understanding of CHWs programs\u2019 compatibility with community structures, cultural values, and perception, socio-economic context and support system [20].",

This perspective to a larger extent provides a limited understanding of the impact of the ecological environment on CHWs [20]. Most programs have not been able to effectively address the gap between research evidence and the routine practicality of CHWs as health professions, hence the poor integration of CHWs within the healthcare system and an even poorer understanding of their roles within their communities. Subsequently, the implication of this postulates the need for a comprehensive approach to plan and design programs that can be integrated with the formal healthcare system\u2019s approach to healthcare service delivery through CHWs roles and organizations [17].",

Contrarily, most studies emphasize the need for CHWs to be integrated within the formal healthcare system whilst placing minimal emphasis on understanding how they are embedded within the community system [21]. Moreover, minimal work has been done locally in terms of implementing universal guidelines to guide the integration strategies required to resolve the above-stated implications. Previous research has proved that the effectiveness of CHWs holds the potential to increase access to equitable health in LMICs [20]. As a result, CHWs\u2019 understanding of the socio-cultural norms of their communities, their unique intermediary position between communities and the health system places them in a central setting in delivering key health interventions. On an individual level, their effectiveness is influenced by contextual factors, such as socio-cultural factors, gender, traditions and norms, training and supervision, health policies combined with intervention-related factors [22].",

Also, [3] argues that government and non-governmental institutions are continuously adding functions and tasks to CHWs, which buttresses the need to inform the type of tasks and position they hold within the healthcare system through competency-based or educational qualification rather than on functionalities. In most LMICs such as South Africa, the roles and responsibilities of CHWs with regards to technical and social capital is limited and yet to be understood [11]. Khalala et al. [23] state that understanding the nature of the work CHWs do, enables researchers to explore the relevant technologies that can be exploited to facilitate and support their daily work. This understanding potentially provides information with regards to the choice of technology and how it can be implemented to support the roles of CHWs. Regardless of the evidence on the social factors influencing CHWs, the exact mechanisms on how to assess the interdependencies of social and technical dynamics\u2019 influence on CHWs outcomes remains understudied.",

Existing literature have focused on the reliability, functionality and infrastructure of the technology while paying minimal attention to the end-users perception on the usability and intentions to use the technology, as a result most of the research focus on the technical characteristics whilst neglecting the impact of the social characteristics of both the individual and community setting where the technology is utilized [27].",

Important to note, technological solutions and processes are not autonomous vehicles, but rather are embedded within systems in a social world where they are used to perform activities which have consequences and influences changes on human behavior, social constructs, and cultural meanings. Thus, the effect of this is that not only does the interaction between the technical and social systems exhibit complexity and unpredictable behavior; it inevitably increases the complexities of dynamic and autonomous relationships, which can be detrimental to the system in place. From the above sections, the following is presented in summary to illustrate the factors identified in the discussion using the STS hexagon for illustration as provided in [13]. Figure 3 illustrates the social and technical perspectives identified from previous literature according to [13].\n",

The approach followed in this study desired that the design activities involve gaining understanding and specification of the context in which the system will be used by referring to the social factors, cultural factors, working practices factors, and the structure of the organization [31]. Thus, the terminologies for the concepts were adapted from this standpoint and were cautiously selected by the author through interpretation about the relevant literature as a means to preserve the relevance of the factors. The concepts were grouped under technical and social context depending on the interpretation of the author, from there, they were categorized under the two social dimensions: health and community systems context depending on whether the influence of the factor on the CHWs was related and reflective of the context in question. This study considers the following fundamental areas under the social system: the individual\u2019s needs, humans\u2019 social behaviors in work systems, internal and external environmental factors and support systems of the work system under investigation [15].",

The second dimension was technology acceptance and utilization which was concerned with factors concerning the CHWs perspectives and readiness to use and accept the technological solution within the environment they work. Finally, the compatibility/fit element was considered as a means to provide the measures required to ensure a balanced joint optimization of both the technical and social aspects [31].

The STS framework was used for the categorization of the factors which were integrated into concepts. For future work, each of these concepts will be evaluated and the categorization refined to present a broader conceptual framework. This study forms part of a dissertation project and the findings in this study form part of the first high-level conceptual framework which will be used in conducting scoping literature review to identify additional components for the secondary-level conceptual framework. In addition, future plans involve exploring the task-technology fit model to identify the relevant technological solutions fit for peri-urban and rural contexts in South Africa.",
