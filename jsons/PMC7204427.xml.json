Trials to assess the efficacy of antirheumatic therapies such as hydroxychloroquine1 and anticytokine therapies such as interleukin-6 inhibitors2 to improve outcomes in patients with Covid-19 are ongoing. The rationale for their use is that worse outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, ventilation, or death) may be related to a proinflammatory cytokine storm.3,4",

Established patients at New York University Langone Health in New York City who had immune-mediated inflammatory disease were assessed during the period from March 3 through April 3, 2020 (average follow-up, 16 days from symptom onset). We analyzed the demographic and clinical data on patients who had immune-mediated inflammatory disease with symptomatic Covid-19 and compared the patients for whom hospitalization was warranted (hospitalized patients) with those for whom it was not (ambulatory patients).",

Of these patients, 62 of 86 (72%) were receiving biologics or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and the overall incidence of hospitalization was 16% (14 of 86 patients). The hospitalized patients were older than the ambulatory patients. Although the distribution of diagnoses of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases was similar in the ambulatory group and the hospitalized group, a higher percentage of admitted patients had rheumatoid arthritis. As compared with the ambulatory patients, more of the patients for whom hospitalization was warranted had coexisting hypertension, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
