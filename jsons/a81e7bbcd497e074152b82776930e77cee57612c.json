The speed of microbial genome sequencing has been steadily accelerating since the introduction of modern DNA sequencing methods more than thirty years ago (Sanger et al. 1977) . The accumulation of sequenced genomes of bacteria shows a good fit to exponential functions with a doubling time of approximately 20 months (Koonin and Wolf 2008) . Despite the historical bias towards the \"working horses\" of bacterial genomics, such as commensals E. coli and B. subtilis (Collado-Vides et al. 2008) , the depth and breadth of the coverage of sequences belonging to different species of viral, bacterial, fungal and protozoan pathogens has been rapidly expanding.",

            "text": "Microbial genomes are thousands or millions of base pairs in length, requiring both a global view of the genome and the ability to zoom in on details for the purpose of analysis and annotation. Annotation is the extraction of biological knowledge from raw nucleotide sequences (M\u00e9digue and Moszer 2007) . Such decoding of the genomes allows the prediction of protein-coding genes and therefore, the proteins the organism is able to produce. Desktop computer sequence editors such as Chromas Lite (http://chromas-lite.software.informer.com/), Trace Edit (http://www.ridom.de/traceedit/) or commercial products like LaserGene (http://www.dnastar.com/products/lasergene.php) or Sequencher (http://www. sequencher.com/) are helpful in the initial sequence assessment. The task of assembling of sequences from re-sequencing experiments, when a reference sequence is available, can be supported by tools like TraceEditpro (http://www3. ridom.de/traceeditpro/) or SeqScape. Different software pipelines have been developed to automate microbial genome annotation and assembly (Table 1 .1). The Integrated Microbial Genome (IMG) system, hosted by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), and the RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) server are examples of open resources. Major sequencing centers offer genome viewers and browsers through their websites (McNeil et al. 2007) . For example, Manatee (J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI)) has been developed to view and to alter initial automatic annotations of prokaryotic genomes. The Sanger Institute's Pathogen Sequencing Unit has been maintaining freeware for sequence analysis, viewing and annotation, such as Artemis and the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) (Carver et al. 2008) . The alignment of genomes of three strains of Staphylococcus aureus using ACT is shown in Fig. 1.1 . Alternatively, multiple genome alignments in the presence of large-scale evolutionary events, such as rearrangement and inversion, can be efficiently constructed and visualized using the Mauve program (http://gel.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve/download. php) (Darling et al. 2004 ). These tools assist in the rapid identification of protein-coding 1 Informatics for Infectious Disease Research and Control genes, as well as other features like non-coding RNA genes, repetitive sequences or recently acquired DNA.",

The figure was produced using Artemis software (The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK) 1 Informatics for Infectious Disease Research and Control evidence-based gene calling or translating alignments of the DNA sequence to known proteins; and (3) aligning cDNAs from the same or related species. Gene finding has progressed far beyond the simple identification of open reading frames. The programs aligning cDNA and protein sequences to genomic DNA can locate the protein coding regions by searching the publicly available databases or by applying machine learning algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM). There is a long list of such programs including GeneMark, mORFind, PRODIGAL (Prokaryotic Dynamic programming Genefinding Algorithm), Argon and GLIMMER (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov Modeller) (Delcher et al. 1999; Suzek et al. 2001; Majoros 2007) . They differ in the time required for automated annotation as well as the quality of gene calling (Guigo et al. 2006) . Problems with the accuracy of current gene finders reflect not only the performance of their algorithms but also the quality of the primary resources and the abundance of non-coding DNA regions in microbial genomes. Genome assembly annotation methods and tools including new applications for RNA genes, were reviewed in detail elsewhere (Stothard and Wishart 2006; M\u00e9digue and Moszer 2007; Brent 2008; Pop and Salzberg 2008) .",

These technologies make it feasible to sequence not only static genomes but also entire transcriptomes expressed under different conditions (Shendure and Ji 2008) . However, they can produce read lengths as short as 35-40 nucleotides, which cannot be analyzed with software developed for Sanger data as they are often non-unique, lack neighborhood context and have a different distribution of errors. The task of linking such short-reads may be accomplished using a comparative assembly algorithm, in which new sequences are put together by mapping them onto close relatives or the \"reference genomes.\" Not surprisingly, the comparative assembly strategy works best when the two species are more than 90% identical. Alternatively, when no \"reference genome\" is available, the new cohort of assembly algorithms based on de Bruijn graphs -a way to transform sequence data into a network structure -has risen to the task (Chaisson and Pevzner 2008; MacLean et al. 2009 ). Strategies and systems that address these new challenges have recently been reviewed elsewhere (Pop and Salzberg 2008; MacLean et al. 2009; Ussery et al. 2009 ",

These data include the size of a genome and its nucleotide composition, the locations of genes and intergenic regions, GC percentage and gene density. Microbial genomes are compared by the number of particular sets of genes, gene order (synteny) and the presence or absence of important genes. Other metrics include gene set properties (the number of two component system regulatory genes) and nucleotide sequence-based measures (distance between paired twocomponent system genes and consensus sequence) (Whitworth 2008; Ussery et al. 2009 ). These metrics represent a global view of genomes but often have limited biological meaning. Thus, \"signature\" sequences have been suggested as a means of identifying organisms or genes with sequence profiles correlating with the pathogen phenotype or disease outcomes. Examples of genome characteristics that are more directly related to biologically important behavior are bacterial IQ (a measure of the number of signal transduction proteins as a function of genome size) and extrovertedness (the proportion of signaling proteins predicted to sense external stimuli) (Galperin 2005) . Analyses of genomics data challenge the traditional taxonomy of microbial species. Recent projects have focused on producing simple analytical diagnostic tools based on strong taxonomic knowledge collated in the DNA reference libraries such as the DNA Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD; http://www.boldsystems. org). These types of data enable the acquisition, storage, analysis and publication of DNA barcode results, and provide clues about the global distribution of species. Their genetic diversity and structure is based on two postulates: first, that every species is represented by a unique DNA barcode (indeed there are 4 650 possible ATGC combinations compared to an estimated 10 million species remaining to be discovered (Fr\u00e9zal and Leblois 2008) ), and second, that the genetic variation between species exceeds the variation within species. DNA barcoding requires a minimum sequence length of 500 bp and more than three individual sequences per species. The initial Barcode of Life framework was based on the sequence of a single universal marker -the cytochrome c oxidase gene -but has evolved since then, giving rise to a flexible description of DNA barcoding, a larger range of applications and the broader use of the term \"barcode\" (Fr\u00e9zal and Leblois 2008) . For example, the whole microbial genome's barcodes were defined as frequency distributions of periodic DNA sequences or k-mers across the whole genome (Zhou et al. 2008 ). It has been postulated that such barcode similarities are proportional to the genomes' phylogenetic closeness and could be utilized in metagenome analyses (Zhou et al. 2008) .",

As a result, computational techniques assist in exploring similarities between virulence factors and other genes with known functions. This association can then be tested using targeted genetic methods such as the inactivation of the putative virulence gene followed by the comparison of phenotypes of the original and modified microorganisms Raskin et al. 2006) . A strategy that does not rely on sequence similarity for identifying potential genes is the detection of coding sequences, which is based the gene context \"grammars\" supplemented with machine learning models (Garrido et al. 2008) . For example, functional gene recognition tools GeneMark and GLIMMER employ Hidden Markov models, in which the preceding nucleotide bases are used to predict the next base in a coding region, and the algorithm is trained on a trusted set of sequences.

Under the network vision of the microbial world, microbial chromosomes are not envisaged as strictly defined genotypes gradually changing in time but rather as islands of temporary, relative dynamic stability that form tightly connected (vertically and horizontally) areas of the network (Koonin and Wolf 2008) . The infection cycle should be considered as a whole and the links between growth, virulence, immune evasion and transmission should be assessed (Restif 2009 ).",

One can abstract the actions of proteins and metabolites by representing genes acting on other genes as a gene network or as genetic regulatory, transcription or expression networks. Such networks can be constructed using computationally assigned functional linkages inferred by Rosetta Stone, Operon or similar methods (Rachman and Kaufmann 2007; Harrington et al. 2008) , and often point to highly connected and central proteins frequently referred to as \"hubs\" (Wu et al. 2008) . Biological interaction and communication networks share several commonalities: they are scale free (only a few nodes are highly connected) and are small world networks (highly clustered with short distances between any two nodes) (Kann 2008) . Increasingly, disease pathogenesis and the mechanisms of drug action are viewed from a biological systems perspective (Wu et al. 2008) . From this perspective, a deeper understanding of infectious diseases may rely on an exhaustive characterization of all potential interactions occurring between proteins encoded by viruses and those expressed in infected cells. Thus, the integration of all protein-protein interactions into an infected cellular network, or \"infectome,\" offers a powerful framework for the virtual modeling and analysis of infections (Navrati et al. 2009 ). The terms \"interactome\" and \"phenomics\" have been coined in this context (Lussier and Liu 2007) .",

For example, the VirHostNet is a knowledge base for the management and analysis of proteome-wide virus-host interaction networks and a resource of manually curated interactions defined for a wide range of viral species (Navrati et al. 2009 ). Genomic and proteomic data is often informationally synergistic, allowing for the reconstruction of known pathways from the first principles. The combination of these forms of data have been used to identify libraries of recurring motifs, where the mixed semantics of the pattern promises to be more informative than any single data source taken in isolation in building biological networks (Michael et al. 2008; Stavrinides et al. 2008) . Systems biology has arisen from various attempts to move away from the reductionist approach, which is hindered by the difficulty of breaking a system into separable and meaningful parts. It encompasses several high-throughput analytic technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics to measure gene expression and its regulation at the level of messenger RNA and microRNA production, proteomics to measure changes in protein production, and computational biology, which depends on analytic software packages for analyzing, organizing, and interpreting those data (Sakata and Winzeler 2007) . Such an approach treats pathogens and their environments as a series of hierarchical levels or networks from gene products to whole organisms and integrates the time dimension in order to structure knowledge and to determine rules that would allow navigation between levels (Lisacek et al. 2006 ). This approach demands new tools for data management, the integration of which offers the opportunity to correlate multiple lines of evidence and to reduce uncorrelated noise.",

These computational models have the capacity to guide and direct wet lab experimental efforts complimenting traditional in vivo, in situ, and in vitro testing with the emerging in silico approach (Lengauer et al. 2007; Raman et al. 2008) . Some impressive starts have been made on bacterial models in the form of simulation tools.

Increasingly, the genomic, proteomic and metabolomic data have to be integrated with traditional literature in a machine-readable way. Typical sets of experimental data yield component lists with quantitative content data and a catalog of interactions and networks. This requires the establishment of a middleware to convert experimental data into a format suitable for manipulation and viewing by end-users. For example, the Generic Model Organism Database project (GMOD; http://gmod.org) aims to link experimental data with corresponding contextual meta-data about experimental conditions and protocols in a multi-user, multi-center environment. It offers a collection of open source tools for creating and managing genome-scale biological databases ranging from a small database of genome annotations to a large web-accessible community database. Another approach is to trade off the width of integration for more depth with regard to a particular analysis task, and to employ workflow systems such as InforSense (http://www.inforsense.com) or Taverna (http://taverna.sf.net). These act as glue layers between various data sources and analysis packages and are also often referred to as pipelines, in silico protocols or e-experiments (Turnbaigh et al. 2007) . \"Pipeline\" is mostly used to describe executable workflows, while the other terms are dedicated to abstract workflows (Lisacek et al. 2006) .",

For example, in the pragmatic world of diagnostic bacteriology, conserved housekeeping genes such as the 16S rRNA gene, rpoB gene and others have been accepted as reliable targets. They are found in all microorganisms and show enough sequence conservation for accurate alignment as well as enough variation for phylogenetic analyses (Christen 2008) . Furthermore, the 16S rRNA gene based phylogeny is sufficiently congruent with those based on whole genome approaches. Sequencing of six to eight genes or loci, as it typically done in multilocus sequence typing analysis, may constitute a reasonable compromise between single genebased and whole genome-based methods for species diversity studies.",

A pathogen profile is a single, multivariate observation or set of observations, comprised of classes of specific attributes (e.g., genome, transcriptome, proteome or metabolome data), which are designed to allow the interrogation of existing or future databases, and the integration of genomics and post-genomics data with clinical observations and patient outcomes. The profile may indicate the probability that a specific marker is associated with a clinically relevant phenotype such as in vivo antimicrobial resistance or high transmissibility. This information allows the classification of strains into \"risk groups\" for treatment failure or a propensity to cause outbreaks of infections. It is often important to capture the quantitative information about a pathogen, in vivo, i.e. viral or bacterial loads and their units of measurement. In contrast to traditional subtyping, which is based on phenotypic characteristics such as serotype, biotype, phage type or antimicrobial susceptibility, genetic profiling describes the phenotypic potential in the nucleic acid sequence. A pathogen profile is a synthesis of various markers and clinical end-points, which can be extracted from medical charts that characterize an individual patient's clinical and public health outcomes. The profile may be heuristic, when only a single genetic marker is associated with a specific patient outcome, while more insights can be achieved when attributes from different levels of the biological hierarchy (i.e. gene detection, gene expression, metabolite profiles etc) corroborate and complement each other. Machine learning algorithms, such as E-Predict (Urisman et al. 2005) , are being developed to identify viruses and bacteria present in clinical samples. These profiles are based on the microarray hybridization patterns or DNA sequences of pathogens.",

The most frequently utilized are electronic guidelines and protocols, especially for the empirical selection of antibiotics. The majority of DSS result in improvement in clinical performance and, in at least half of the published trials, in improved patient outcomes (Finch and Low 2002; Sintchenko et al. 2008a) . The revival of interest in prescribing-decision-support reflects the recent change in emphasis from support for diagnostic decisions towards support for patient management, and the changing focus from systems targeting a broad range of clinical diagnoses to task-and condition-specific decision aids. Despite reported successes of individual applications, the safety of electronic prescribing systems in routine practice has recently been identified as an issue of potential concern.",

The great diversity of mutational patterns contributing to antimicrobial resistance complicates the choice of optimal therapies. A range of bioinformatics tools to predict drug resistance or response to therapy from a genotype, have been developed to support clinical decision-making (Beerenwinkel et al. 2003; Lengauer and Singh 2006) . These tools use either a statistical approach, in which the inferred model and prediction are 1 Informatics for Infectious Disease Research and Control treated as regression problems, or machine learning algorithms, in which the model is addressed as a classification problem (Sintchenko et al. 2008a) . A statistical learning approach to the ranking of therapeutic choices often relies on a direct correlation between the baseline microbial profiles, the therapeutic decision and the patient's response to treatment (e.g., expected reduction in viral load resulting from anti-HIV combination therapy). For example, several susceptibility scores have been used for combination antiretroviral therapy. These take into account specific resistance mutations and add up the activities of individual drugs in the regimen (Lengauer and Singh 2006) . Computer-assisted therapy depends on the availability of widely shared databases that can correlate quality-controlled data from genotypic resistance assays and treatment regimens with short-and long-term clinical outcomes. Databases such ARDB (Liu and Pop 2009 ) capture differences in antimicrobial sensitivities and reflect variation in the amino acid composition of resistant microbes, but simply counting mutations may not be enough to predict functional differences, which affect treatment outcomes.",

Investigations of the impact of host genetics on the susceptibility to HIV infection and the rate of disease progression have mainly used a candidate gene approach to reveal associations with a number of different genes. The genome-wide association studies look at the genetic variation across the human genome in order to uncover factors not previously suspected of influencing infection outcomes. For example, this strategy identified variants of the HIV virus associated with differences in the control of viral load at set points and in disease progression.

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that \"taking apart\" analyses have reached their limit, and the time has perhaps come for integrative science (An and Faeder 2009) . Developments in informatics have been critical in supporting and engaging with both reductionist and integrative paradigms. On one hand, informatics has equipped comparative genomics with tools to scrutinize genes and explore genetic polymorphisms. On the other hand, informatics has enabled the generation of integrative and testable hypotheses through the discovery of knowledge in databases and through the study of gene-phenotype connections between a pathogen and its host environment. A variety of data sets can be integrated, including the patient's demographic and clinical presentation, the laboratory results, the pathogen's gene regulation and expression, and metabolic maps with different parameters reflecting the phenotypic behavior of a pathogen and host factors. In early years some skeptics saw informatics-assisted research as a distraction of effort and funding away from traditional hypothesis-driven inquiry. Since then, infectious disease informatics has verified its status as a platform for hypothesis generation and testing ). New breakthroughs in infectious disease informatics (IDI) are the result of cross-pollination between different disciplines that use technologies to gather and disseminate knowledge (Fig. 1.3) . Microbial genome sequence analysis and metagenomics have contributed intriguing new data types and data sources to IDI. Bioinformatics has brought to the IDI a range of analytic tools, databases and data standards. Conventional health informatics and computer science has provided high performance solutions for the data storage, sharing, analysis and visualization as well as clinical terminology libraries, data standards, decision support and technology evaluation frameworks. Importantly, the infectious disease informatics community has fed the lessons learnt from the implementation of clinical and public health systems back to the broader audience.",

At the same time, it provides an opportunity to apply the engineering paradigm to biomedical research, thereby mandating the development of tools that can dynamically represent a body of current knowledge. However, the simplistic application of brute force computational power to massive reams of biomedical data is unlikely to result in meaningful mechanistic insight.
