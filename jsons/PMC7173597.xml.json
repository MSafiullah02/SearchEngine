The fact that Gram-positive bacteria are more acidic than Gram-negative bacteria may account for their greater affinity for a basic dye. Even more important may be the greater permeability of Gram-negative cell walls which allow the methyl violet-iodine dye complex to diffuse out after treatment with acetone more readily than the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria.",

Mycobacterium tuberculosis causing tuberculosis may be taken as an example where these three postulates may be fulfilled, but there are many other examples where complete fulfilment of these postulates does not occur, as with Treponema pallidum and syphilis, Epstein-Barr virus and glandular fever, Chlamydia trachomatis and non-specific urethritis.",

In recent years, there has been an increased interest in bacterial adhesiveness factors, such as the pili of gonococci or of E. coli strains that cause urinary tract infections (see\nChapter 19). It has also become apparent that the \u2018virulence\u2019 of bacterial strains may also depend on the presence of transmissible genes contained in plasmids or mediated by bacteriophage. The adhesiveness to the ileal mucosa of an E. coli strain that produces enteritis in pigs is dependent on the presence of the K88 capsular antigen, a factor which is plasmid mediated. Enterotoxin production by this E. coli strain is also dependent on the presence of\nthe appropriate plasmid. In man, the toxins produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae and the erythrogenic toxin produced by Strep. pyogenes strains in scarlet fever patients are dependent on genes mediated by temperate phages. The fact that particular microbes appear to be more or less virulent at different times, might be due in part to the presence or absence of these types of transmissible genes. Scarlet fever is much less frequent than 50 years ago although streptococcal sore throats are still common. Skin sepsis due to Staph. aureus strains in hospital maternity units appears to be much less serious than in the 1950s. The microbial and the other factors that affect the virulence, and the spread of pathogens are often unclear (see\nWilliams, 1976).",

When an isolate shows strong immunofluorescence or gives a positive latex co-agglutination test with a specific anti-gonococcal serum, there is good evidence that the isolate is a gonococcus (but the medicolegal differentiation traditionally depends on the results of biochemical tests).Immunological tests are also used in reference centres to serogroup meningococci into one of the three main groups, A, B or C.

E. coli and salmonellae are characteristically motile (they are flagellated coliforms) whereas klebsiellae and shigellae are characteristically non-motile. Semisolid agar methods are available (e.g. \u2018Craigie tube\u2019) for testing for the motility of a possible salmonella or shigella isolate, which are safer than the hanging drop method.\nBiochemical tests, in addition to lactose fermentation, include urea, glucose, mannite, sucrose, indole, citrate, hydrogen sulphide production and decarboxylases for apparent \u2018non-lactose fermenters\u2019 and indole, citrate and inositol for \u2018lactose fermenters\u2019.Commercial kits are available to assist this identification process which must be carried out on pure cultures. For the identification of \u2018difficult\u2019 organisms, a computer analysis of the results may be useful at a reference centre.A few simple characteristic examples of the results of biochemical tests include:\n\nThere are also classic \u2018IMVIC\u2019 tests for lactose fermenters isolated from possibly faecally contaminated water supplies\u2014indole, methyl red, Voges-Proskauer, inositol and citrate. These biochemical tests may be performed at 44\u00b0C to recognize E. coli type I from a possible human faecal source (e.g. from polluted water).3\nImmunological tests Suspensions of suspected pathogenic faecal coliforms can be tested against known specific antisera in slide or tube agglutination tests. Specific \u2018O\u2019 (somatic antigen) antisera are used for the identification of isolates of salmonella, shigellae and enteropathogenic strains of E. coli. Specific \u2018H\u2019 (flagellar antigen) antisera are mainly used to identify Salmonella species. A salmonella culture on a nutrient agar is often used for agglutination tests but it may be in a \u2018non-specific H phase\u2019. To convert the Salmonella to a \u2018specific H phase\u2019, a \u2018phase switch\u2019 may be necessary using a Craigie tube method.\n",

On blood agar, Haemophilus influenzae shows improved satellite growth around Staph. aureus colonies due to the release of factor V from the staphylococci. (Haemophilus parainfluenzae does not require factor X but does require factor V.)Haemolysis is another cultural factor that is used for identifying less pathogenic Haemophilus species, such as Haemophilus haemolyticus, which may be found in the normal throat flora.Capsulated strains of Haemophilus influenzae often grow well with a green sheen on Levinthal's agar. The capsules can be Pittman typed using specific anti-capsular sera (in a Quelling type reaction). The usual capsular type H. influenzae infecting infants is Pittman type b. This capsular antigen may sometimes also be detected using an immunoprecipitation test.2\nDifferentiation from coliforms Most parvobacteria species will not grow well (if at all) on MacConkey's agar after overnight incubation, in contrast to \u2018coliforms\u2019 and most Pseudomonas species. Most of the parvobacteria will not grow in peptone water sugars unlike coliforms, an important exception being Pasteurella multocida. Some parvobacteria will not grow anaerobically on blood agar after overnight incubation unlike coliforms.3\nYersinia, Pasteurella and Bordetella species A range of cultural tests on MacConkey agar, blood agar, enriched and selective media combined with biochemical tests, motility and haemolysis tests help to identify a particular Yersinia or Pasteurella species.
