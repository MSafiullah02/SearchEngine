To date, despite gradually improved mechanical ventilation, there are no effective and approved treatments for ARDS [1, 2], remaining a high mortality rate of 40% [3]. In recent years, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived from bone marrow-based cell therapy is a potential and ideal therapeutic approach for ARDS. MSCs are widely used in the study of stem cells therapy for ARDS because of their capacity of target homing, self-renewal, multipotent differentiation, and paracrine productions. MSC homing to damaged lung tissue is a key process for ARDS treatment. Despite reported success, it is demonstrated that the amount of engrafted MSCs homing to target lung tissues was lower than 5% [4, 5]. Thus, a new strategy for MSC migration is needed.",

Recent studies have also shown that short-term exposure of MSCs to hypoxia can enhance cell survival properties and boost the tissue repair capability [11, 12]. Hypoxic preconditioning has been extensively studied in a number of organs and tissues in relation to diseases to enhance therapeutic effects, such as cardiomyocytes [11, 13\u201318], endocrine [19], intestinal tract [20], kidney [21, 22], and liver [23].",

LncRNAs take part in the regulation of cell growth and movement. They regulate transcription via chromatin modulation, post-transcriptional regulation, organization of protein complexes, and allosteric regulation of proteins [25]. The large intergenic non-coding RNA-p21 (LincRNA-p21), located in chromosome [26], was first described in 2010. Recently, LincRNA-p21 has been reported that it is involved in the contribution of hypoxia to the Warburg effect in cancer cells [27]. LincRNA-p21 was induced by HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxic conditions, which disrupts the HIF-1\u03b1-VHL interaction, thus upregulating the available HIF-1\u03b1 and regulation of angiogenesis and the Warburg effect [27\u201331]. However, the relationship between LincRNA-p21 and MSC migration and survival capacity under hypoxic preconditioning in vitro were not certain.",

Naderi-Meshkin et al. had reviewed various strategies to improve homing of MSCs [33]. Hypoxic preconditioning MSC is regarded to be extremely protective approach against subsequent lethal hypoxia damage [9, 10]. Hypoxic preconditioning refers to the brief hypoxic stimulus viscera in advance, making the viscera of subsequent hypoxia tolerance for a long time. Hypoxic preconditioning fully mobilizes the body\u2019s protective reaction and inhibits traumatic reaction, and it is the most potent endogenous protective mechanism so far. In our study, we introduced scratch test and transwell migration assays to investigate the hypoxic preconditioning on MSC migration. The results showed that hypoxic preconditioning promoted MSC healing area and cellular migration numbers. These revealed that hypoxic preconditioning triggered MSC migration. We made further investigation to explore the effect of hypoxic preconditioning to MSC survival. Our data revealed that hypoxic preconditioning improved MSC survival by increasing cell viability and attenuating apoptosis. The results demonstrated that hypoxic stimulation had the positive effects of MSC migration and survival.",

            "text": "To explore mechanism of hypoxia preconditioning enhanced MSC migration and survival, we examined the expression of LincRNA-p21, HIF-1\u03b1, Hyp564 HIF-1\u03b1, CXCR4, and CXCR7 in MSCs after hypoxia preconditioning. HIF-1 is a key mediator of hypoxic response complex [34], consisting of HIF-1\u03b1 (and subsequently HIF-2a and HIF-3a) as the O2-responsive subunit and HIF-1b as the constitutively expressed subunit [35]. HIF-1 regulates transcription of variety gene types in hypoxic conditions, including angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, cell cycle, metabolism, and apoptosis. Upon normoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 can be rapidly degraded by ubiquitin/proteasome pathways. Proline hydroxylation occurred in HIF-1\u03b1 (Pro564 and Pro402), which resulted in conformational changes due to the binding of HIF-1\u03b1 and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. This was followed by ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. However, hypoxia can inhibit HIF-1\u03b1 degradation and lead to its stability [36, 37]. The protein encoded by VHL gene includes elongin B, elongin C, and cullin-2 and possesses ubiquitin ligase E3 activity, and it is a component of the protein complex. This complex plays roles in the ubiquitination and degradation of HIF. Studies showed that therapeutic effects were improved on hypoxic treatment due to HIF-1\u03b1 stability in hypoxic cells [32, 38]. LincRNA-p21 was first reported to be a direct transcriptional target of p53 and to mediate p53-dependent apoptosis [39] and then has an important role in regulating p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in doxorubicin-treated mouse embryo fibroblasts [40]. Moreover, LincRNA-p21 transcripts were shown to increase in livers of mice treated with the carcinogen furan [41]. In recent study, LincRNA-p21 was discovered in increasing the available HIF-1\u03b1 and regulation of angiogenesis and the Warburg effect [27\u201331]. Fan Yang et al. showed that LincRNA-p21 could be induced by HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxic conditions and contribute to disrupt the HIF1A-VHL interaction [27]. Meanwhile, other study [32] showed that HIF-1 was key regulators of cell response to hypoxia and could activate gene transcription of cell homing in anoxic conditions, which related with (chemokine stromal-derived factor-1) SDF-1/CXCR4. SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is considered to be key link in the process of stem cell homing. CXCR4/7 are receptors of chemokine stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). The quantity expression of lung SDF-1 and CXCR4 was increased in bleomycin injured lung model and others [42\u201344]. Staller et al. [45] reported that a mechanism between VHL and CXCR4 activation during tumor cell evolution and the tendency to home to selected organs. In our study, MSCs were cultured under hypoxia environment (1% O2). MSCs induced by hypoxic preconditioning evoked an increase in expression of LincRNA-p21, HIF-1\u03b1, and CXCR4/7(SDF-1receptors). Next, we knocked down LincRNA-p21 of MSC and introduced HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor KC7F2 to explore mechanisms. Blockade of LincRNA-p21 by shRNA and HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor KC7F2 abrogated unregulation of hypoxic preconditioning induced CXCR4/7 in MSCs and cell migration and survival. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that hypoxic preconditioning isolated VHL and HIF-1\u03b1 protein by increasing HIF-1\u03b1 expression. These revealed that LincRNA-p21 and HIF-1\u03b1 took part in MSC enhanced homing capacity and survival under hypoxic preconditioning. LincRNA-p21 stabilized HIF-1\u03b1 protein via VHL under hypoxic preconditioning.",

To research the role of MSC LincRNA-p21 on HIF-1\u03b1 and CXCR4/7 under hypoxic preconditioning, we used shLincRNA-p21 to test signaling change by RT-PCR, WB analysis, and co-immunoprecipitation method to test signaling change under hypoxic preconditioning (1% O2) at 24 h. a Three different knock-down ways of LincRNA-p21 on MSC under hypoxic preconditioning. b The effect of knock down of MSC LincRNA-p21 on HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA relative expression under hypoxic preconditioning. c The effect of knock down of MSC LincRNA-p21 on HIF-1\u03b1, Hyp564 HIF-1\u03b1, and CXCR4/7 protein expression under hypoxic preconditioning. d The effect of knock down of MSC LincRNA-p21 on interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and VHL protein.
