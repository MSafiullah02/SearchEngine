            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has become a pandemic threat leading to more than 4,170,000 confirmed cases and 287,399 deaths globally, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on May 13th, 2020. Although the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough, a number of patients have experienced neurological manifestations such as headache, dizziness, hypogeusia and hyposmia during the course of the illness [1\u20134]. In addition, patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities such as cerebrovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer than patients who did not require ICU care [3]. Furthermore, it has been found that the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV, the virus that is responsible for the pandemic infectious disease\u2014severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2014happened in 2002 and 2003 [5]. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to access human cells, as does SARS-CoV [5]. Therefore, cells expressing ACE2 may act as targets and thus are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, it has also been reported that glial cells and neurons, in addition to endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells in the brain express ACE2 receptors, which renders them potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 [6\u20138]. Such evidence indicates potential neurotropic involvement of SARS-CoV-2 [8\u201310]. It is therefore of great importance to investigate its neurotropic effects and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Thus, we have reviewed the neurological characteristics of COVID-19 and summarized possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 involvement in the central nervous system (CNS).",

Headache has been the most common neurological manifestation reported by COVID-19 patients [1, 2]. A systematic review of 554 COVID-19 patients concluded that the mean prevalence of headache was 8% (95% CI 5.7\u201310.2%) [11]. Apart from headache, dizziness is also a common neurological manifestation of COVID-19, with a reported prevalence of between 7 and 9.4% [3, 12]. Of 138 hospitalized patients, those who required ICU care (n = 36) were more likely to report dizziness than those who did not (n = 102) (ICU 8/36 [22.2%] vs non-ICU 5/102 [4.9%], P = 0.007) [3]. Confusion and headache were the fifth (9/99 [9%]) and sixth (8/99 [8%]) most common symptoms of the 99 COVID-19 patients at admission, respectively [13]. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that a number of cases of COVID-19 have had concurrent severe neurological symptoms, such as acute CVD (acute ischemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage), meningitis/encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and acute Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome [14\u201319].",

            "text": "It is worth noting that the prevalence of neurological manifestations was higher in a report by Ling et al. who paid more attention to the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 than the aforementioned studies. Of the 214 COVID-19 patients in that report, 78 (36.4%) patients had neurological manifestations. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have neurological symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%], P < 0.05), such as acute CVD (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%], P < 0.05), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%], P < 0.001) or skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%], P < 0.001). The most common neurological manifestation was dizziness (36 [16.8%]), followed by headache (28 [13.1%]), impaired consciousness (16 [7.5%]), acute CVD (6 [2.8]), ataxia (1 [0.5%]) and seizure (1 [0.5%]). In addition, symptoms involving the cranial nerves, such as hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia have also been reported in 19 (8.9%) patients [4]. The reason for the difference in incidence of different neurological manifestations between the various reports remains unclear. One possible factor maybe because of the little we know about COVID-19. Because it is a recently identified disease, COVID-19 has been principally identified by its prominent symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnea and not the less common neurological manifestations such as headache, dizziness, and chemosensitive impairment [20]. An analysis of the course of illness has provided evidence that smell and taste impairment are early manifestations of COVID-19, usually appearing in the first 5 days of illness. Ageusia and anosmia were the first symptoms of disease in a number of patients [21]. As recognition of the disease having developed, the reported incidence of chemosensitive impairment in COVID-19 has been considerably higher than in the initial stages, ranging from 19.4 to 88% [20\u201323]. In addition, as stated by Bookstaver and collaborators, the clinical symptoms of viral infection are usually nonspecific and sometimes may be mild or symptomless [24]. Therefore, the prevalence of neurological manifestations was very likely underestimated in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak [21, 23].",

            "text": "Up to now, there is sparse direct evidence of the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2. However, it has been found that the viral structure as well as the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to that of SARS-CoV. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to the ACE2 receptor to access human cells [5]. Therefore, evidence previously found for SARS-CoV may also apply to SARS-CoV-2. A considerable number of studies have provided strong evidence for the neurovirulence of SARS-CoV. Apart from neurological manifestations reported by SARS patients [30], SARS-CoV was detected in samples or specimens of SARS patients. CSF samples of a SARS patient who presented generalized tonic\u2013clonic convulsion tested positive for SARS-CoV, suggesting possible infection of the CNS by SARS-CoV [31]. Jun et al. isolated SARS-CoV from a specimen of brain tissue of a patient with SARS that had presented severe CNS symptoms. Pathological examination of the brain tissue indicated neuronal necrosis and glial cell hyperplasia [32]. Furthermore, SARS viral particles and its genomic sequence were detected in the neurons in the brains of all eight confirmed cases of SARS autopsies. Of these, six confirmed cases presented edema and scattered red degeneration of the neurons [33]. Animal models also provided evidence of SARS-CoV being neurotropic. The results suggested that the brain was the principal target organ for SARS-CoV in the mice transgenic for human ACE2 (hACE2 mice) [34]. SARS-CoV enters the brain mainly through the olfactory bulb and rapidly spreads transneuronally to other related zones of the brain. This widespread neuronal infection and the concomitant neuronal loss, except for lung infection, account for the major cause of death in hACE2 mice [35]. These findings of neurovirulence in SARS-CoV could provide circumstantial evidence of the neurotropic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.",

For instance, neurological symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, and impaired consciousness as well as symptoms involving the cranial nerves (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia) have been reported in COVID-19 patients [2, 4, 20, 22, 23]. Importantly, the neurological manifestations presented by COVID-19 patients have been nonspecific and difficult to differentiate from encephalopathy induced by systemic viremia occurring outside the CNS [36]. Elderly patients with chronic underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of encephalopathy in the setting of acute infections. In addition, COVID-19 patients, especially severe cases, frequently present severe systemic manifestations such as hypoxia, viremia, cytokine storm and coagulopathy which can induce encephalopathy in addition to the direct effects of SARS-COV-2 [3, 37, 38]. A series of case reports have reported that COVID-19 patients presenting with headache, altered mental status, acute CVD, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and acute Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome but without abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 does not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and does not cause meningitis or encephalitis [14\u201318, 39, 40]. Although a direct association between the aforementioned symptoms of encephalopathy and COVID-19 requires further investigation, COVID-19 should be considered first when conducting differential diagnosis during the pandemic because of the probable risk of transmission as a result of missed diagnosis.",

Moreover, the olfactory nerve serves as a shortcut for many viruses into the CNS [46]. Olfactory receptor neurons project dendrites into the nasal cavity and extend axons through the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulb of the brain [46]. It has been reported that nasopharyngeal swabs of multiple patients have tested positive [47, 48], and the major route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is via the respiratory tract through the nose. Meanwhile, hyposmia and hypogeusia are neurological manifestations reported in some cases [4, 20, 22, 23]. Furthermore, it has been found that SARS-CoV enters the brains of hACE2 mice mainly through the olfactory bulb, resulting in rapid, transneuronal spread to related areas of the brain [35].

In published reports of SARS-CoV-2, a cytokine storm, elevated D-dimer levels, and thrombocytopenia have been reported [38, 49]. Intracranial cytokine storms, which could result in the breakdown of the BBB without direct viral invasion, might be responsible for the development of acute necrotizing encephalopathy or Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome [16, 17]. Coagulopathy observed in COVID-19, together with a cytokine storm, could render patients prone to cerebrovascular events, both thrombotic and hemorrhagic [18].",
