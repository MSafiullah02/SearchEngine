The division offers its services in two semi-closed intensive care units consisting of 17 beds of Level 3 care. The concept and rationale behind this relatively new subspecialty and its organization in our center are presented in this brief report.",

European Society of Cardiology set up a working group 1 with a current membership of 1000 members, which has transformed into Acute Cardiovascular Care Association. This group has also started a journal called Journal of Acute Cardiovascular Care. European Society of Cardiology has published a number of documents including a textbook 2 on this subject. The British Cardiovascular Society Working Group has also published a similar and comprehensive document with its recommendation on training in acute cardiac care. 3 A survey done by the American Heart Association Writing Group on the Evolution of Critical Care Cardiology that looked at the organization and staffing practices in US cardiac intensive care units has revealed a growing trend of involvement of cardiologists trained in the critical care at least in the academic centers. 4 These publications address the nonsurgical patients only. It is important to include the post cardiac surgical care in the same context for future discussions and planning of a more comprehensive specialty.",

Intensivists would be engaged in performing tasks such as bronchoscopies, bedside tracheostomies, mechanical management of complicated myocardial infarction, renal failure, and management of septic syndromes. These skills are being developed with the help of those who traditionally practised them and also through establishment of properly constructed training programs. This trend, however, is not without certain risks, but they can be mitigated if limitations of acquired skills are recognized and higher levels of competencies are unabashedly sought and encouraged.",
