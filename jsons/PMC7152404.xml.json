This physician-led, health-centered team typically is engaged in regular interaction and troubleshooting in collaboration with an industrial hygienist and safety officer, who are usually oriented more toward process and plant operations, documenting regulatory compliance, and identifying and measuring health hazards. These hazard-oriented professionals usually report to a different manager or directly to the plant manager. This basic pattern was once the norm in industry, but the dramatic reorganization in industry, management focus on core business, and the rise of the service sector have forged a new pattern, in which services are outsourced to contractors and consultants.2\n",

It includes physicians, occupational health nurses, industrial hygienists, and other occupational health professionals. The OH-CG is a working council, sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services, within what will eventually become a health-sector ISAC (Informational Sharing and Coordination) organization. This is a highly unusual and encouraging development in many respects. ISACs have official status with the Department of Homeland Security and are intended to coordinate the planning response of critical sectors of the American economy and society. They have been formed, for example, in industry sectors such as critical utilities and transportation. The OH-CG was the first health-sector ISAC to be created and is now the Occupational Health Subcommittee of the Healthcare Sector Coordinating Council, the ISAC for healthcare. This is a remarkable achievement for a relatively small medical specialty. Because occupational health is cross-cutting across industries, the OH-CG is expected to serve as a resource for other critical sectors rather than to focus primarily on the health sector per se and in so doing uniquely relate to other ISACs as much as the one of which it is a part. Its mission is to provide occupational health professionals with what they need and when they need it in a time of crisis through channels that do not depend on any one mode of communication.",

Surge capacity operations may be created away from the hospital under the direction of the LEPC, county emergency manager, or hospital. This may include separate healthcare mutual aid agreements specific for the incident and secondary triage and treatment provided by trained physicians and other healthcare providers through the use of vendor agreements or prepositioned equipment and supplies. This strategy will enable the hospital and community healthcare delivery system to operate at near-standard operations during an industrial incident. Any facility that has potable water, electricity, and shelter may participate. Pre-existing arrangements for accessing these sites should be spelled out under mutual aid agreements, vendor contracts, memoranda of understanding, or special circumstances agreements negotiated in advance between the county emergency management office, the hospital, or the local employer.
