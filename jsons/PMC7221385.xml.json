As of 17th April 2020 (10:00am CET), more than 2,160,170 cases have been diagnosed globally, with over 68,976 fatalities. [1] COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that is transmitted by large respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected secretions. Therefore, on 23rd March 2020 the UK government released the following guidance to reduce the risk of transmission. \u201cEveryone must stay at home to help stop the spread of coronavirus. You should only leave your home for very limited purposes: 1) shopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible 2) one form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household 3) any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid or escape risk of injury or harm, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person and 4) travelling for work purposes, but only where you cannot work from home.\u201d [2] This guidance was implemented for an initial 3-week period, with the \u201clockdown\u201d extended for a further 3 weeks on April 16th, 2020. [2] It should also be noted here that prior to the mass guidance those UK public who were at high risk of serious complications if contracting COVID-19, lived with someone who was at high risk of serious complications if contracted COVID-19, and the elderly were encouraged to self-isolate.",

One behaviour that may be impacted by self-isolation/social distancing is that of sexual activity. Sexuality is complex and encompasses a myriad of phenomenon that include partnerships, behaviours, attitudes, identity, orientation, beliefs and activity [3] and specifically sexual activity can encompass a plethora of acts including penetrative sex (vaginal, anal), oral sex, and mutual masturbation. Importantly, a frequent and trouble-free sex life is associated with a plethora of physical and mental health benefits.",

It was found that sexual inactivity was significantly related to cancer, bladder/bowl problems, major surgery, poor vision, mental health conditions, and cardiovascular disease and its risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. Additional associations were found with sexual inactivity including hearing loss and dementia for men, and dermatologic conditions, problems with the joints, bone or back, gastrointestinal problems, chronic wound care, and gum disease in women.

It is possible that maintaining an active sex life or reintroducing frequent sexual activity into one\u2019s life during self-isolation/social distancing may mitigate some of the potential detrimental consequences of COVID-19 self-isolation. However, to date not literature exists on this topic. Moreover, it is important to note that dating applications (such as Tinder) are popular in the UK [17] and one key motivation for using such applications is to engage in casual sex.

In addition, potential differences in the prevalence of sexual activity by number of days of self-isolation (i.e., 0-5 days, 6-10 days, \u226511 days) were studied using chi-squared test. Effect sizes were estimated using phi coefficient (chi-squared tests with binary categorical variables), Cramer\u2019s V (chi-squared tests with categorical variables with more than two categories), Cohen\u2019s d (t-tests with continuous variables), and eta squared (ANOVA with continuous variables). Finally, the association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. Independent variables included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, the number of chronic physical conditions, the number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and the number of days of self-isolation. All potential predictors were included in the regression analysis as categorical variables except the number of chronic physical conditions, the number of chronic psychiatric conditions and the number of days of self-isolation that were included as continuous variables. There were less than 6.5% of missing values for the variables used in this study, and therefore complete case analysis was carried out. Results from the logistic regression analysis are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Because the effect size was small for the number of days of self-isolation, OR and 95% CI are displayed for a seven-day increase. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed with R 3.6.2 (The R Foundation).",

            "text": "There were 868 individuals included in this study (63.1% of women and 21.8% of adults aged 25-34 years; Table 1\n). During self-isolation/social distancing, 39.9% of the population (N=346) reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week on average, and was thus classified as sexually active. There was a particularly high prevalence of male sex, younger age, married/in a domestic relationship, employment, high annual household income, and current alcohol consumption in adults with sexual activity compared to those without sexual activity (all p-values<0.001; Table 1), while the number of chronic physical conditions was significantly lower in the sexually active than in the non-sexually active group (p-value=0.002; Table 1). The mean number of sexual activities was 1.75 (standard deviation=8.35) in the overall population, and this number was significantly higher in men than in women (3.23 versus 0.88, p-value=0.002; Table 2\n). Moreover, the prevalence of sexual activity significantly increased from 33.5% in people who were self-isolated for 0-5 days to 47.0% in those who were self-isolated for \u226511 days (p-value=0.010; Figure 1\n). Finally, the results of the multivariable regression analysis are displayed in Figure 2\n. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing.",

[11,[19], [20], [21]] These findings suggest that interventions to promote good mental and physical health during the COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing period should take into account positive sexual health as part of any messaging. Interventions might particularly focus on females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. A detailed discussion on potential strategies is beyond the scope of this paper. However, would likely include the promotion of respected websites such as [22], as well as platforms to provide advice and support in relation to sexual activity among older adult populations.",

This may be explained by the simple fact that each day of self-isolation/social distancing would increase ones chances of engaging in sexual activity if they are sexually active or potentially sexual activity is being used for a means to ease stress and anxiety or overcome boredom which is likely to increase with increasing days of isolation. Moreover, in modern times people lead busy lives and may have little discretionary time to spend with their intimate partner. COVID-19 self-isolation may have disrupted daily activities that take time from one\u2019s day, such as commuting to work, this time may be being spent with one\u2019s partner allowing them to reconnect with increasing days of isolation and consequently engage in sexual activity. However, there is no literature to support these hypothesizes and future work of a qualitative nature is required.",
