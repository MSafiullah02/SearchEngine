By the end of the epidemic, the global cumulative patient total was 8098 with 774 deaths. Seven Asian countries/regions were among the top 10 populations affected, China and Hong Kong accounting for 87% of all cases and 84% of deaths from SARS (Lam et al., 2003). SARS was mostly confined to the populations of South\u2010East and East Asia (Mainland Chinese, Hong Kong residents, Vietnamese, Singaporeans and Taiwanese). The disease is caused by infection with a novel single\u2010stranded RNA coronavirus (Peiris et al., 2003) and starts with an influenza\u2010like illness characterized by non\u2010specific, systemic symptoms, followed by the rapid development of an unspecific bronchopneumonia associated with lower respiratory tract or gastrointestinal symptoms. Most patients recovered after 1 or 2 weeks, but some developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome (Zhong et al., 2003). The confined geographical and ethnic spread pattern of the disease suggested the possibility of genetic variations that had influenced susceptibility to infection with SARS\u2010CoV and the development of the disease itself.",

Also, an association study that examined polymorphisms in the cytokine response genes [interferon (IFN)\u2010gamma, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010alpha and interleukin (IL)\u201010] showed that the 874 A/T IFN\u2010gamma SNP was a risk factor for SARS infection, although no association was seen with either TNF\u2010alpha or IL\u201010 polymorphisms (Chong et al., 2006). Chan et al. (2006) reported that individuals who were homozygous for CLEC4M (a binding receptor for SARS Co\u2010V) were less susceptible to SARS (Chan et al., 2006). Conversely, association studies failed to demonstrate that ACE2 SNPs were implicated in SARS (Itoyama et al., 2005), and that the ACE I/D polymorphism was neither directly related to increased susceptibility to SARS\u2010coronavirus infection nor the clinical outcome of SARS patients (Chan et al., 2005).",

Corrected P\u2010values (Pc) were obtained by multiplying the number of antigens or alleles (Edward, 1974: reference not listed) at each locus: A (n = 15), B (n = 32) and DRB1 (n = 13). A Pc value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Odds ratios (OR) rather than relative risks (RR) were quoted since ORs are most commonly used in HLA association studies. The values were obtained from standard contingency table analysis using Haldane's modification of Woolf's method (Haldane, 1956). An OR value > 1.0 implies that subjects carrying the antigen are at an increased risk of a disease (a positive association), while an OR value < 1.0 implies that subjects carrying the antigen are at a lower risk of a disease than those not carrying the antigen (a negative association).",

On the other hand, mutation of SARS\u2010CoV might result in changes of its T\u2010cell receptor epitope, which would require a specific HLA allele(s) for presentation. Because of the poor fidelity of RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase, genetic variation typically gives rise to a heterogeneous virus pool in RNA populations, including coronaviruses. This feature makes viruses highly adaptable and contributes to difficulties in preventing and controlling viral diseases. The virus isolated from the Guangzhou patients is the prototype of the SARS\u2010CoV, with a reported moderate mutation rate, that subsequently was found in Hong Kong and countries around the world (Zhao et al., 2004). The Guangzhou SARS\u2010CoV has the highest homology (> 99%) with the sequences of the SARS\u2010CoV that were isolated from SARS cases in Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore, Canada and the USA, suggesting that all of these SARS\u2010CoV are closely related (Zhong et al., 2003), therefore mutation of SARS\u2010CoV could not be considered as a major contributory factor in the lack of HLA association observed in the present study.",
