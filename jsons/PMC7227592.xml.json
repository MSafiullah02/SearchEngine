The scientific and political communities have reacted to this challenge with a varied degree of urgency. The initial days were mired by a lack of accurate and adequate recommendations. This was related to the fact that this was a novel virus and nothing was known about it. However, with the scientific community reacting aggressively to the situation, we got a fairly good understanding of how the virus attaches to the host cells, causes organ damage, and probable treatment targets. This resulted in a flurry of studies conducted in order to arm the healthcare sector. We saw Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and resmdesivir, being extensively tested as possible treatment strategies [[1], [2], [3]]. The trials for an effective vaccine are also ongoing [4]. However, in the interim period we need strategies in place to prevent the spread of infection. Social distancing and hygiene became the targets for preventive strategies. Several countries, including India, went ahead with a stringent lockdown [5].",

A total of 12 countries, including India were taken up for analysis (Table 1\n). China was left out in view of the restructuring of data. A few other countries also declared lockdown; however, in view of a lot of missing data, they were excluded from the analysis. We intended to include a parallel comparative arm (countries without complete lockdown). However, due to a variable definition of restrictions imposed in most of the other countries, we could include only Sweden and South Korea (countries with minimal degrees of restrictions) as the additional arm. Instead of using both these countries as comparators, we decided to include them in a cluster analysis and visualize where exactly they fit in.",

In the absence of any definitive treatment modalities and a vaccine, the only effective strategy at present seems to be preventive in nature. A variety of preventive strategies have been put in place by different governments across the world. Some have increased the frequency of testing in an attempt to identify asymptomatic carriers, whereas others have gone for symptom-based screening [7]. Home isolation, quarantine strategies, and complete lockdown are other social distancing strategies employed. Complete lockdown has been the toughest social isolation measure taken to date. It is projected to be the most effective measure preventing the spread of infection, whereas there are significant economic and social downsides associated with it [8]. Lockdown has been declared to be working well by different governments across the world, resulting in extension of the lockdown periods. Some countries, including India, have gone for phased relaxation of lockdown by identifying several districts as hotspots.",
