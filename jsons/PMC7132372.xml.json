Furthermore, more than half of them believed that influenza vaccination might reduce hospital admission and extra medical expenses, showing that they have correct perception on influenza and influenza vaccine. However, while more than 60% of vaccinees in the high risk group agreed that they were not in good health and at high risk of catching influenza, and they are interested in vaccination because of bad health, only 28.3% and 42.5% of non-vaccinees, respectively, agreed on that. Also, 48.3% of vaccinees were advised to get vaccinations while only 28.3% of non-vaccinees did receive the advice. This shows apparent difference in the perception of one's health between vaccinees and non-vaccinees and, therefore, efforts should be made to inform people about the priority group of vaccination in order to increase coverage rate.",

Moreover, belief that \u2018vaccine must be taken annually\u2019 was a predictor for vaccination. Efforts to increase vaccination rate in priority group for at least one season may have influence over vaccination for several years. This may be particularly useful in the situation of vaccine shortage, when it is recommended by authorities that supply of vaccines should take precedence to priority group.33\n",
