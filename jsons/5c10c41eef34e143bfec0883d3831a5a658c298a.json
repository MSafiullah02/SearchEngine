The virus CoV-19 usually propagates and induces the clinical symptoms in infected people within 14 days (Li et al., 2020a, b; Huang et al., 2020) . Earlier similar two forms of fatal COVID-19 were seen, and they were SARS, that was epidemic in China in 2003, and MERS, that was epidemic in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (She et al., 2020; Shereen et al., 2020) . Few existing anti-bacterial, anti-malarial and ant-HIV medicines such as Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, lopinavir; ritonavir (remdesivir (GS-5734), tocilizumab, corticosteroids, certain nucleotide as inhibitors, COVID-19 protease inhibitors are re-proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 (Gautret et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020) without much clinical experiences. Since no specific medicine or vaccine is available to control the disease, social lockdown is considered as the only preventive measure to control COVID-19 (Das and Paital, 2020; Paital et al., 2020) .",

It therefore leads to a better consequence by 1) preventing huge load on healthcare system (by high infection rate) at a certain time point, 2) restricting mass/community infection, 3) providing better health care to the infected persons with limited heath care resources. Also, it would provide more time to the researchers to work on the virus for production of specific medicine or vaccines against COVID-19. Owing to such importance of social lockdown, many nations started following it at different time points of the COVID-19 infection to their citizens with different level and strictness. As a result of social lockdowns, the entire world is found to stands still. On the other hand, due to casual follow up of this social move and many other reasons such as low immunity, ageing, comorbidities, the disease has infected 2,573,605 people so far, out of which 701,838 individuals have recovered and 178,562 have lost their lives (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2020a) .",

This was the theme once written in the \"shock doctrine\" of disaster capitalism, outlined by the author and activist Naomi Klein.

Many species become extinct and many have occupied the world following such climatic events. It leads to stabilize the world as a unitary ecosystem. In this context, pollution and unhygienic level in many ecosystems under dominant activities of human (including urbanisation, fossil fuel exhaustion, industrialization and discharges of its effluents to water bodies) are beyond the limit. For example, UK toxic air was claimed to place 1.24 million lives at risk in 2017 (Lancet Planetary Health, 2017) . Similarly, water pollution has been found to create tragedy in many water bodies including oceans (Paital et al., 2018 . Under such conditions, probably Mother Nature was waiting for a break to revive her individual ecosystems. It seems that social lockdown to combat COVID-19 has given a much awaited break to her for self-regeneration. Humans are locked indoor and their dominant activities are stopped, as a result, important environmental indices such as the reduced NO 2 , CO 2 emissions, water pollution, and increasing air quality in many polluted cities have been observed . How COVID-19 induced social lockdown has helped nature to nurture was the central focus of this review and emphasis was also given how long nature can able to maintain it. A light discussion was also made on whether the introduction of COVID-19 was natural plan by the Mother Nature to self-revive? All authentic news sources such as Reuters, BBC news, Times, Hindustan India, India Today, WHO etc. along with scientific literature were carefully analysed to reply above questions positively.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the debate on the origin of the virus is now slowly catching pace among many experts. Genetic sequence analysis of CoV-19 indicates that it has 50% and 79% similarities with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively. So, experimental results disprove so far that CoV-19 is not engineered in laboratory rather it is a natural mutated strains from its above two pre-existing forms Guo et al., 2019; Science News., 2020; Scripps Research Institute., 2020; Shereen et al., 2020) . However, the Nobel laureate Professor Montagnier, who had shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine (for his work on the identification of AIDS virus) with his colleague professor Fran\u00e7oise Barre-Sinoussi, claimed that \"The presence of elements of HIV in the genome of the coronavirus and even elements of the \"germ of malaria\" are highly suspect, the Wuhan city laboratory has specialized in these coronaviruses since the early 2000s. They have expertise in this area and therefore the theory that Covid-19 virus originated in the lab is making rounds for quite some time\" (DT NEXT, 2020). Similar stories are online that, Japan's Nobel Prize winning Professor of Medicine, Professor Dr. Tasuku Honjo has claimed that the Coronavirus is not natural but has been manufactured, although the statement is found to be fabricated (Guniganti, 2020) . Conversely, if experimental results are to be believed, then it can be concluded that nature has introduced CoV-19 Guo et al., 2019; Science News., 2020; Scripps Research Institute., 2020) . However, the question remained unsolved that for what purpose the Mother Nature has introduced it? It is a million dollar question, although, experts opines it as \"just a natural evolutionary event\" that the novel J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f CoV-19 was emerged from two of its pre-existing form using bat as its host. On the other hand, the planet had witnessed many natural catastrophic events to make a pause or control over the misbalanced ecosystem or an overpopulation of a particular species. The extinction of dinosaurs is considered as one of such bright examples (Kumar, 2018; Brusatte et al., 2015; Donihue et al., 2018) . It seems much philosophical but makes a valid discussion that nature wanted to self-regenerate with zero contribution of human being or keeping then indoor self-locked. And, it has been happening via introduction of CoV-19 followed by the imposed social lockdown. Study must be focused to answer this evolutionary question in order to teach human society to follow such lockdown voluntarily in order to allow for the self-regeneration of nature. This may be referred as natural selection by nature, for nature to self-regenerate. It is witnessed in Qatar, where, people have demanded COVID-19 like lockdown to resuscitate their deteriorated environment (Bir, 2020) . The above point seems valid when climatic changes have been observed in several metro-cities in the planet.",

In China, responsible for the world's biggest carbon emissions, is noted to experience a temporary fall of ~18% CO 2 emissions during February and March 2020. Around a reduction of 250 m tonnes of carbon sources are used in China which is equivalent to > half annual output values in the entire UK. Similarly, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 Europe is predicted to experience a reduction of around 390 m tonnes of carbon sources as a result of lockdown. In USA, the main source of CO 2 emissions is passenger vehicle traffic. It is magnificently reduced to ~40%. A reduction of ~44% car sells and huge reduction in fossil fuel consumption in London add a glimpse note to the reduction of emission factor. Since consumption of fossil fuel is the main source of CO 2 emissions in industrial sectors and by vehicular traffic, both were shut down contributing to the observed changes. Rob Jackson, the chair of Global Carbon Project opines that \"The drop in emissions is global and unprecedented. Air pollution has plunged in most areas. The virus provides a glimpse of just how quickly we could clean our air with renewables. He also added \"I refuse to celebrate a drop in emissions driven by tens of millions of people losing their jobs because the human cost is too high and the environmental gains could prove temporary. So, we need systemic change in our energy infrastructure, or emissions will roar back later\". This is potentially good news for the weather as oil is the principal source of the carbon emissions that are heating the earth and upsetting weather cycles. It is believed that it could mark the start of a prolonged downward trend in emissions and the beginning of the end for huge fossil oils.",

These issues act as precursor to initiate several other physiological disorders and diseases . In extreme cases, noise pollution can also lead to dementia, stroke, and heart attack (European Union, 2015). All sources of noise pollution are due to human activities. Residential noise (i.e. neighbours), noise from commercial premises (markets), building site, burglar alarm, loud speakers, noise in the street (vehicular traffic) and noise in air (aircraft) are few main types ((European Union, 2015) . Surprisingly, road traffic accounts for premature deaths equivalent to the loss of roughly \"1.6 million healthy years of life\" in Western Europe alone. Noise remains a big source of pollution for the other inhabitants of the planet as well, namely, animals and most importantly bird, the most noticeable and vocal animals observed everywhere. Chronic traffic noises are hazardous to birds and impose huge negative effect on their embryo mortality and growth in zebra finches. Noise pollution affects many other creatures ranging from frogs, to shrimp, to fish, mammals, mussels and snakes and they have different ranges of sensitivity to noise (Schuster, 2020, Table 1 ). And, most of the sources of noise such as air conditioner, air craft J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 17 and wind turbine, city traffic (Car etc.), road traffic, loud television, railway, standing siren are found to be above the sensitivity level (Fig. 1) . International flights are almost standing still due to lockdowns (supplementary Fig. 5) . So, most of the noise in every sector is created by human activities are stopped for the time being. Last month, road and air traffic fell substantially in many counties. In Indian major cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, the foot print (as measured by daily average changeover of foot prints (%) in terms of walk-ins from home to bank, groceries, petrol pumps, and diagnostic centres) to the respective sectors are reduced during lockdown , Livemint, 2020 .",

Due to COVID-19 outbreak, many climatic data gaps have been arriving across the world. Climatic data collected on regular mode for the protection of mankind have caught a pause and the gaps prevailed during lockdowns are not going to be filled any more in future. For examples, twice per year, Ed Dever's group at Oregon State University in Corvallis heads out to sea off the Oregon and Washington coasts to refurbish and clean more than 100 delicate sensors that make up one segment of a US$44million-per-year.The Scientific network called it as the Ocean Observatories Initiative. As per Ed Dever \"If this had been a normal year, I would have been at sea right now\" (Viglione, 2020) . On the other hand, due to lockdowns and industrial shutdowns as an effects imposed by COVID-19, pollution in city air and water bodies is receiving a down mode due to lack of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f massive use of fossil fuels and discharge of industrial effluents (Verkooijen, 2020; Levy, 2020) . Two major factors i.e. CO 2 and NO 2 emissions are already discussed and examples of many sparkling water in rivers and canals of several countries are cited. However, one important aspects i.e. effects of environment on the propagation and infection of Coronavirus is yet to be studied. As discussed, temperature may have negative effects on the life cycle of the virus for which countries such as India with the 2 nd highest population status is getting a delayed infection and death under COCID-19. Although a strict social lockdown is given credit for this achievement, the hot and humid climates could also be a reason in India for having a lower rate of infection . Debate was rigorous on the topic, whether the virus is really unstable at high temperature? However, putting an end to this hypothesis, a study published in Lancet indicates that CoV-19 has a negative correlation with temperature ( Fig. 2, Chin et al., 2020) . As per their statement \"SARS-CoV-2 in virus transport medium (final concentration \u223c6\u00b78 log unit of 50% tissue culture infectious dose [TCID50] per mL) was incubated for up to 14 days and then tested for its infectivity (appendix p 1). The virus is highly stable at 4\u00b0C, but sensitive to heat. At 4\u00b0C, there was only around a 0\u00b77 logunit reduction of infectious titre on day 14. With the incubation temperature increased to 70\u00b0C, the time for virus inactivation was reduced to 5 mins\" (Chin et al., 2020) . Further the authors have noticed that the virus has more stability on the smooth surfaces than rough one.",

Case studies in many countries including Italy, USA, Philippines, Denmark, Chile, Brazil, Mexico and Peru have confirmed this fact. A case study in US indicates that COVID-19 associated death rates are raised by about 15% in areas where even a small increase in fine-particle pollution level is observed than pre-COVID-19 period. The Lombardy and Emilia Romagna regions of northern Italy that experience more air pollution, found to have 12 and 4.5% more death rates, respectively, as compared to other unpolluted areas of the country. And, since COVID-19 is principally a respiratory syndrome, polluted air can logically increase the risk of death of infected patients. In this context, it is noteworthy to mention that > 90% of the world's population live in places, mostly in poor countries where, air pollution exceeds its guideline limits. It could lead to hypothesise that severity of the COVID-19 infection may be augmented by particulate matter present in air (Table 2, 3, WHO, 2020b, c). In one hand, the particulate particle may carry the virus itself or it may create more complication in the respiratory track of patients during CoV-19 infection. Therefore, using mask even inside home in severely air polluted area is strongly recommended.",

The COVID-19 has taken millions of people off the streets in Asia, Europe and the United States. All staying home are lifting the weight indirectly for a global environment what they even not imagined while working actively. Therefore, from cleaner air to sparkling water, lockdowns against coronavirus in the planet seem to have a number of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f positive and progressive effects on the environment but by putting a pause on modern social life of human (Child, 2020) . Cleaner air is perhaps the most valuable outcome of the lockdowns, for example, people in Northern India are now able to view of the overall image of Himalayan mountain range (supplementary Fig. 6a) . And, it has happened once in their life time due to massive drop of air pollution and settling down of air particulate matters. This was also the case in UK where, the reduction of NO 2 and particulate material in air has been dropped as compared to the same time point of previous year (Child, 2020) . USA and other countries are also experiencing the same trend from their normal level of (PM2.5 and PM10) particulate matter (Table 2 and 3, EPA, 2017 , WHO, 2020a . NASA, the European Space Agency (via Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite) has clearly demonstrated a drastic decline in NO 2 and CO 2 emission in many countries including China, USA, and Italy (Zehner, 2020) .

It is predicted that such nurturing to global environment would not be possible in the Cop26 UN climate talk that was planned originally to be held at Glasgow. So the public debate is still continuing by UN leaders, scientists and environmental activists for the (self?) recovery of green environment and clean energy. Emphasis is given for building efficiency to make natural infrastructure to reinforce global environments. Open letters appealing governments must be posted to make equal strategies for recovery packages to revive nature (which is now easy to handle) along with getting back to business economy. As opined by Inger Andersen, UN's environment chief, \"75% of new infectious diseases are usually animal born and they are communicated more rapidly to humans through wildlife trafficking (by direct contact), deforestation (force wildlife to invade human habitats) and then the epidemics spread in the planet via air travel and cruise-ship tourism. China being the world's biggest wild animal market probably has contributed to COVID-19 this way.\" Now it appears that the country has accepted this and therefore, forbidding the farming and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 22 consumption of live wildlife and its trading. Such alarming calls are also getting a pace globally to \"wet markets\". On the other hand, it gives a strong message that over exploiting nature, ignoring to dismantle natural settings, neglecting deforestation etc. put our own safety on earth at threat and, COVID-19 outbreak is the active example to be considered. So, the current pandemic is good or bad for the environment completely depends on human but not on the CoV-19, because the later has been acting as effect not as cause. So, post COVID-19 outbreak time must be utilised to put pressure from all sectors of society especially from political sections not go back to unsustainable business as usual rather than to emerge with a healthier environment (Andersen, 2020) .",

On the other hand, Qatar is witnessed as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 23 the first country to demand such lockdown on regular basis at its landscape, as its people understood environmental issues such as increase in sea level, temperature, ocean acidification, intensity of sand storms induced serious risk as a result of pollution and their management by lockdown.

The entire world including 210 nations is following lockdown with a different level of stringency to combat COVID-19. Countries like India and China had been following a very stricter and early lockdown for which they are enjoying a controllable infection and death rate from COVID-19. However, the virus has a negative correlation with temperature for its propagation and alcoholic based standard sterilisers can deactivate it. On J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the other hand, reduction of human dominancy in environment is resulted in a drastic climate change. Mostly due to shutdown of industries and restriction of vehicular traffic, as a result, use of fossil fuels is reduced substantially. Therefore, NO 2 and CO 2 emissions are radically reduced in many metropolitan cities across world. Such favourable natural changes have made wildlife to move with full freedom in one hand, and the biodiversity is elevated in any areas on the other hand. Due to the reduction in air particulate matter and fall in water pollution in many places such as Italy, Spain, France, Los Angeles of USA, Wuhan city of China and New Delhi of India, people are experiencing the never seen elevated environmental revival due to cleaner air, and sparkling water bodies and beautiful wild animals roaming around human habitats. Due to shutdown of bus, train and flights, wild animals especially birds are enjoying a noise free environment. It is nothing but the Mother Nature is trying to bouncing back. After the end of 100 days of lockdown in some of the countries, it has been felt that life is possible without so much modernised life style especially those acts associated with fossil fuels. Solar energy, wind meals etc. can be used instead. It is a glimpse of what the world might look like without fossil fuels but hopes that humanity could emerge from this horror into a healthier, cleaner world, and, will depend not on the short-term impact of the virus, but on the long-term political, institutional, social, communal and individual mind-set and collective decisions to give a checkmate to climate deterioration.",
