            "text": "Up to date, more than 4600 species of mammals have been identified in Class Mammalia. The top two orders within mammalian consist of Rodentia and Chiroptera, which are with over 2000 and 930 species, respectively (Wong et al., 2007). Since the Middle Ages (A.D. 500\u20131400), many historical records and recent studies have shown that rodents play major roles for transmission of important zoonotic diseases, such as plague and hemorrhagic fever (Meerburg et al., 2009). Since the 1990s, some studies have also shown that bats were associated with several emerging zoonotic agents, including Hendra, Nipah, rabies, Ebola, and coronavirus-like viruses (Calisher et al., 2006, Maeda et al., 2008, Wong et al., 2007). Concannon et al. (2005) first demonstrated that bats could be infected with Bartonella in the United Kingdom. In the study using molecular identification of the gltA gene, 5 (two Pipistrellus spp., one Nyctalus noctula, one Myopterus daubentonii, and one Myotis mystacinus) of 60 blood samples collected from bats were detected to harbor Bartonella DNAs (Concannon et al., 2005). Reeves et al., 2005, Reeves et al., 2007 further detected Bartonella DNA in ectoparasites of bats, such as Trichobius major, Cimex adjunctus, and Sternopsylla texanus, using PCR of the 16S\u201323S rDNA intergenic spacer (ITS) region. Recently, using whole blood culture, Bartonella organisms were successfully isolated from bats in Kenya, and 106 of the 331 bats tested by whole blood culture were shown Bartonella bacteremic (Kosoy et al., 2010).",

The PCR-positive samples for the gltA gene were further analyzed by PCR of the 16S/23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ITS) (Jensen et al., 2000). For further phylogenetic analysis, confirmed Bartonella isolates were analyzed by partial sequences of the ftsZ, rpoB and ribC genes. For PCR amplification of the ftsZ gene, a set of primers Bfp1 and Bfp2 was used to amplify an expected 900-bp product (Zeaiter et al., 2002). Primers 1400F and 2300R were used to amplify a 900-bp fragment of the rpoB gene (Renesto et al., 2001). For PCR amplification of the ribC gene, a set of primers ribC-F and ribC-R was used to amplify an expected 800-bp DNA fragment (Inoue et al., 2009). As the 16S rRNA gene has been well-accepted for species identification of bacteria, the primers P8 and Pc1544 were used for amplifying approximately 1300\u20131400 bp of the 16S rRNA gene (Heller et al., 1997).",

In our study, a total of 35 blood specimens from the bats, Pipistrellus abramus, belonging to the same genus, were collected. However, no Bartonella isolates have been obtained from these specimens by whole blood culture. It might be related to the limited samples tested in our study, or related to the sensitivity of different detection methods. Using the sequences of the partial gltA gene, when the sequences found in Pipistrellus spp. by Concannon et al. (2005) were compared to the sequences of the bat isolates in our study, the DNA similarity values of 86.7\u201390.9% indicated that Bartonella species in bats in the United Kingdom were not closely related to the isolates in Taiwan. Our phylogenetic analysis further supported that bat isolates in Taiwan formed a unique clade, which was separated from the sequences of Bartonella in bats in the United Kingdom (Fig. 1). Recently, Kosoy et al. (2010) reported Bartonella isolates from bats in Kenya. Among the 331 bats tested, Bartonella were isolated from 106 animals using whole blood culture. The Bartonella-bacteremic bat species were Eidolon helvum (23/88), Rousettus aegyptiacus (22/105), Coleura afra (4/9), Triaenops persicus (7/8), Hipposideros commersoni (1/4), and Miniopterus spp. (49/87) (Kosoy et al., 2010). In our study, we also tested the bats from the same genus of Miniopterus (M. schreibersii) and Hipposideros (Hipposideros terasensis). Due to only one sample of H. terasensis tested, no Bartonella isolate was obtained in our study. However, we cultured Bartonella isolates from the blood of 42.9% (6/14) of the M. schreibersii. After sequence analysis, the results indicated that the DNA identity of these isolates from M. schreibersii in our study was not closely related to the strains isolated in Miniopterus spp. in Kenya (95.8\u201396.1% to the strain HM545139, and 92.5\u201392.9% to the strain HM545140).",

On the basis of sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of gltA, ftsZ, rpoB, ribC genes and 16S ribosomal DNA, the bat isolates No. 7 and No. 16 could belong to one genotype, as their rpoB and ribC sequences were not similar to the other Bartonella isolates in bats in Taiwan (divergence values: 4.3\u20134.8% and 4.7\u20135.1%, respectively).",

In our study, to study the bat isolates, except for the gltA gene, sequences of the 16S rRNA, ftsZ, ribC, and rpoB gene were also analyzed. As reported by the ad hoc committee for the re-evaluation of the species definition in bacteriology, descriptions of a new species could be based on housekeeping gene (encoded metabolic functions) sequence analysis with a comparison of at least five genes (Stackebrandt et al., 2002). The study by La Scola et al. (2003) also documented that newly encountered Bartonella isolates should be considered as a new species if the 327-bp gltA fragment and 825-bp rpoB fragment shared <96.0% and <95.4% sequence similarity with those of validated species, respectively. In comparison with the sequences of the gltA, ftsZ, rpoB and ribC genes of the Bartonella type/reference strains, the DNA similarity values of the bat isolates in Taiwan were less than 91.2%, 90.5%, 88.8%, and 82.2% to all known Bartonella species, respectively. After phylogenetic analyses using the merged set of concatenated sequences of the 16S ribosomal DNA, gltA, ftsZ, rpoB, ribC genes, all the results strongly suggested that the isolates from M. schreibersii in Taiwan could be considered as a new Bartonella species.",

It was also found that the segment of the ftsY genes in the bat isolates in Taiwan was shorter than Bartonella species tested, including Bartonella australis, Bartonella henselae, Bartonella quintana, Bartonella grahamii, Bartonella bacilliformis, and B. tribocorum (Fournier et al., 2006, Fournier et al., 2007).
