            "text": "The potential deleteriousness of mutational load (excessive number of mutations in the same genome) is symbolized in Figure 9.1 by the genomes drawn as discontinuous lines that contain five mutations, here assumed to be a sufficiently large number to decrease fitness and, therefore, the frequency of their potential descendants in subsequent replication rounds. Quasispecies dynamics imposes, however, that those genomes that move from a high frequency to a low frequency level be replaced by newly arising mutants that display higher fitness. The mutant cloud is highly dynamic with newly arising genomes incessantly exposed to the scrutiny of selection and the lottery of random drift. The image here portrayed through mutations is even more complex if we add recombination and genome segment reassortment in the case of viruses with segmented or multipartite genomes (Chapters 2 and 3). From the point of view of antiviral interventions, viruses are true \u201cmoving targets,\u201d in the sense that the repertoire of variants that we should inhibit at one time point is not exactly the same to be inhibited at a subsequent time point. The difference may be irrelevant regarding the efficacy of an antiviral treatment, or it may not. The impact of the dynamic change is unpredictable. Applied to clinical practice, it means that a specific inhibitor combination may be effective for many infected individuals for a long time, or only for a few individuals for a short time, with a range of possible intermediate outcomes. The new antiviral strategies discussed in this chapter take into consideration the moving target feature of the viruses to be controlled, and they have been proposed by an increasing number of experts aware of the quasispecies challenge.",

Combination therapy applied to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been the great success for the control of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that has drastically reduced AIDS-related mortality. This type of treatment for HIV-1 is termed highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and it is ideally implemented with three different antiretroviral agents. HAART efficacy has steadily improved due to availability of new inhibitors directed at different HIV-1 targets. Success is only partial due to side effects (that may be derived from off-target activities of the drugs), incomplete patient adherence to the treatment, selection of multidrug-resistant viral variants and, above all, to the retroviral nature of HIV-1 that renders virus extinction from the organism a difficult endeavor. In retroviruses and hepadnaviruses, the viral DNA is not only hidden from antiviral drugs but it can serve as an archive of genomes that can reactivate replication upon treatment discontinuation. If combination therapy could be coupled with an efficient elimination of the proviral reservoirs in host DNA (De Crignis and Mahmoudi, 2014), HIV-1 could probably be eliminated from the infected organism, as achieved in the case of HCV infections in some patients.",

Furthermore, use of combination therapies conforms to the \u201chit early, hit hard\u201d dictum of D.D. Ho, justified in Section 8.10 of Chapter 8. There is the misconception (among some experts, but mainly among politicians!) that only patients in advanced phases of a viral infection (i.e., only precirrhotic or cirrhotic patients infected with HCV) should be treated aggressively with drug combinations. This is not what evolutionary virology teaches us: patients should be treated as strongly as possible and as early as possible, provided side effects can be controlled. Viruses should be given no chance to walk in sequence space in search of adaptive pathways (Chapter 3). Adequate combination treatments can fulfill such purpose.",

            "text": "A second proposed strategy is to divide an antiviral treatment in two steps: an induction and a maintenance step (von Kleist et al., 2011). It is based on a theoretical model developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infections. The key argument is that when a treatment has to be changed after confirmation of treatment failure (virus rebound), mutants resistant to the ineffective drug have had the opportunity to replicate in the patient, increasing the viral load and supplying a proviral archive with inhibitor-resistant latent viruses, thus excluding the drug as a component of future combinations. A treatment with an induction regimen should be followed by a shift to a maintenance regimen at a point in time in which the second drug finds a low viral load and limited numbers of mutants resistant to the initial treatment. Critical issues for the implementation of this proposal are the timing of treatment switch, the decrease of viral load as a result of the induction regimen, and the genetic and phenotypic barriers to the maintenance regimen. Clinical trials are needed to explore this interesting proposal.",

            "text": "Many cellular functions are needed to complete any step of a virus replication cycle. A good deal of research in virology has as its main objective to identify and characterize cellular functions that participate in virus entry into the cell, intracellular multiplication, or release from cells. Since cellular proteins cannot vary in response to the presence of an inhibitor (at least within the time frame of a viral infection), an obvious thought is to administer inhibitors of those cellular functions (often proteins) that are needed to sustain viral replication; such inhibitors should suppress viral replication without selection of inhibitor-resistant mutants (Geller et al., 2007, Hopkins et al., 2010, Garbelli et al., 2011, Kumar et al., 2011, Vidalain et al., 2015). Despite potential benefits, two major problems may be encountered with antiviral agents directed to cellular proteins: (i) toxic effects derived from suppression or alteration of activities in which the target protein is involved and (ii) selection of viral mutants that are insensitive to the presence of the inhibitor, despite the inhibitor not being directed to the virus. Insensitivity may come about by at least three different mechanisms. If the cellular protein which is the target of the inhibitor forms a complex with a viral protein in the course of viral replication, amino acid substitutions in the viral protein may permit progression of the infection in the presence of the inhibitor. This is the case of HCV resistance to the nonimmunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitor SCY-635. NS5A interacts with cyclophilins and with NS5B; amino acid substitutions in NS5A (T17A, E295K, and V44A) and in NS5B (T77K and I432V) decrease the sensitivity of the virus to SCY-635, although the precise molecular mechanism of resistance has been debated (Chatterji et al., 2010, Sarrazin and Zeuzem, 2010, Delang et al., 2011, Kwong et al., 2011, Vermehren and Sarrazin, 2011).",

The observed effect is one among other connections that have been established between nucleotide and DNA metabolism and immune stimulation (Motani et al., 2015).

Stimulation of the innate immune response may restrict the selection of escape mutants because the virus must mutate at several sites to overcome the different branches of the response, as is the case with interferon (IFN) resistance (Perales et al., 2014). Multifactorial antiviral responses increase the genetic and phenotypic barriers to resistance (Section 8.4.2 in Chapter 8).",

Tejero and colleagues, it was suggested that error catastrophe could not occur in the presence of lethal genotypes, a proposal that was considered peculiar by experimentalists, and that it was proven incorrect by Takeuchi and Hogeweg (2007) [see also references in that publication and in Tejero et al.

A rather counterintuitive proposal is that the error threshold is caused by the \u201csurvival of the flattest,\u201d which means dominance of genomes with low replicative capacity and high tolerance to mutations (robustness) that would hinder virus extinction (Tejero et al., 2011) (see Section 5.7 in Chapter 5 on the advantage of the flattest in a fitness landscape).",

Perales and I have carefully reviewed the main experimental results obtained in our and other laboratories on the molecular events that accompany the transition toward virus extinction, and have tried to harmonize the experimental observations with the most realistic and significant theoretical models reviewed by Tejero et al. (2016). The main stream of experimental results can be summarized as follows. The first studies, that were an extension of those carried out in J.J. Holland\u2019s laboratory, confirmed a connection between a mutagenic activity and decrease of viral infectivity and showed that low viral load and low viral fitness favored virus extinction (Loeb et al., 1999, Sierra et al., 2000). Then, following the important discovery that the nucleoside analog ribavirin (1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosyl-1-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) is mutagenic for PV (Crotty et al., 2000) it was observed that ribavirin decreased PV-specific infectivity (the ratio of infectivity to the amount of viral RNA) (Crotty et al., 2001). A decrease of specific infectivity, together with increase of mutation frequency is now considered the standard way to distinguish lethal mutagenesis from mere inhibition (Box 9.2\n). [This is not to mean that decreases of specific infectivity are exclusive of lethal mutagenesis. They have been also documented as a result of codon deoptimization (Section 4.3 of Chapter 4) and in viral clones subjected to many plaque-to-plaque transfers (Section 6.5.2 in Chapter 6)].Box 9.2Main Observations on Viral Extinction by Mutagenic Agents\n\u2022Low viral load and low viral fitness favor extinction.\u2022During the transition toward extinction, the viral population:Decreases its specific infectivity.Increases its mutant spectrum complexity (movement toward usually unfavored regions of sequence space).Maintains an invariant consensus sequence.\n\u2022Reduction in viral load per se is not the mechanism of virus extinction. A load decrease by a mutagenic agent may extinguish the virus while the same decrease with an inhibitor may not.\u2022Viruses displaying different replicative features respond to mutagenic agents in a very similar way: the strategy is of general applicability provided a virus-specific mutagenic agent is available.\u2022The use of mutagens as antiviral agents has been validated in vivo.\n\n",

This result suggested that a class of replication-competent RNA that did not lead to infectious virus was generated during the FU-mediated transition toward viral extinction. A theoretical model developed by S. Manrubia predicted that such defective genomes that were termed defectors were required to achieve LCMV extinction with a limited mutagenic intensity by FU (Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005b). The proposal that loss of viral infectivity is due to the action of defective genomes produced by the mutagenic agent is termed the lethal defection model of virus extinction, and it is consistent with several observations on extinction of other viruses (reviewed in Domingo et al., 2012). A diagnostic test is that loss of infectivity precedes loss of viral RNA (Figure 9.3\n). Lethal defection can be regarded as an extreme outcome of interfering interactions that are exerted among components of the mutant spectrum when their mutational load increases (compare with Section 3.8 of Chapter 3).",

Manrubia, and colleagues distinguished two pathways that viruses can follow when subjected to mutagenesis: lethal defection at low mutagenic intensities, and overt lethality at high mutagenic intensities. Figure 9.4\nrecapitulates our understanding of the steps involved in mutagenesis-driven virus extinction, with the important qualification that no sharp boundary exists between the lethal defection and the overt lethality phases. Studies with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) have provided further support to the lethal defection phase of extinction. Defective FMDV RNAs inhibited replication of standard FMDV RNA in a specific manner when co-electroporated into cells (Perales et al., 2007). Specificity means that the defective FMDV RNAs did not inhibit replication of the related encephalomyocarditis viral RNA. Specificity was also evidenced by the loss of interfering activity of a defector genome by the introduction of a mutation that prevented RNA replication. The requirement of replication of the defective RNAs suggests that a sufficient amount of expressed proteins is needed for interference (Perales et al., 2007). These results are consistent with enhanced and also specific interfering activity exerted by mutagenized FMDV RNA (Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2004). Thus, the available evidence suggests that mutant RNAs\u2014whose frequency and mutational load increase as the mutagenesis proceeds\u2014adversely affect the replication of nonmutated RNAs that coexist in the same replicative ensemble. This is the major molecular event that has been recognized in the lethal defection phase of Figure 9.4.",

When a protein is defective it can jeopardize the activities of any other proteins that interact with it: a trans network can collapse by a domino effect.

The main effect of ribavirin was to accelerate the occupation of A, U-rich regions of sequence space, presumably due to the tendency of this purine analog to produce an excess of G \u2192 A and C \u2192 U transitions (Section 9.4.1). Analysis of the numbers and types of mutations suggests that the A, U-enriched portion of sequence space is detrimental to viral fitness. Movements toward unfavorable regions of sequence space are also suggested by mutant spectrum analyses of FMDV subjected to FU mutagenesis and other viruses subjected to other mutagenic agents (Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2002, Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005a, Agudo et al., 2008, Ortega-Prieto et al., 2013).",

Specifically, models based on the advantage of the flattest that predict absence of extinction (Tejero et al., 2016) in reality predict the extinction of a real virus. This is because the mutagenesis-driven, astray walk in sequence space in the absence of a dominant master sequence should produce increased number of defective genomes (lethal defection) in unfavorable regions of sequence space (such as the A, U-rich regions promoted by ribavirin). The net result should be not only lethal defection but also an increasingly frequent hitting of lethal portions of the space (overt lethality phase in Figure 9.4). Thus, any theoretical models based on genome sequence delocalization fit with the experimental observations (Perales and Domingo, 2016). How such delocalization can be turned into an antiviral strategy is discussed in the next sections.",

No reduction in viral load or increase in average mutation frequencies was noted in the treated patients. However, mutations that likely occurred in HIV-1 in the course of the treatment were predominantly A \u2192 G and G \u2192 A transitions, as expected from the base pairing behavior of the pyrimidine analog.

It is not clear whether lethal mutagenesis is part of the anti-HCV activity of ribavirin, with some studies favoring a mutagenic activity on the virus and others not (Gerotto et al., 1999, Querenghi et al., 2001, Sookoian et al., 2001, Dixit et al., 2004, Asahina et al., 2005, Chevaliez et al., 2007, Lutchman et al., 2007, Perelson and Layden, 2007, Cuevas et al., 2009, Dietz et al., 2013). A mutagenic activity of ribavirin has been documented in cell culture with HCV and subgenomic replicons (Contreras et al., 2002, Zhou et al., 2003, Kanda et al., 2004, Ortega-Prieto et al., 2013), albeit with exceptions (Kato et al., 2005, Mori et al., 2011). The main problem to interpret the mechanism of anti-HCV activity of ribavirin in vivo is that this antiviral agent can act through several nonexclusive mechanisms, including: (i) immunomodulatory activity with enhancement of the Th1 antiviral response (Hultgren et al., 1998, Ning et al., 1998); (ii) upregulation of expression of genes related to IFN signaling pathways (Zhang et al., 2003, Feld et al., 2007); (iii) depletion of intracellular guanosine-5\u2032-triphosphate (GTP) levels associated with the inhibition of inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH, the enzyme that converts inosine-monophosphate into xanthosine-monophosphate in the GTP biosynthesis pathway) by ribavirin-monophosphate (RMP) (Streeter et al., 1973); (iv) inhibition of mRNA cap formation (Goswami et al., 1979); (v) inhibition of viral polymerases, independent of a mutagenic activity (Eriksson et al., 1977, Wray et al., 1985, Toltzis et al., 1988, Fernandez-Larsson et al., 1989, Maag et al., 2001, Bougie and Bisaillon, 2003); (vi) lethal mutagenesis, as evidenced with several RNA viruses (some of the studies are listed in Table 9.1), but not with other viruses (Leyssen et al., 2005, Leyssen et al., 2006, Kim and Lee, 2013).

Inhibition may be a consequence of mutagenesis or inhibition and mutagenesis may have two totally separate modes of action. In the case of the antiviral activity of FU against FMDV, it was possible to show inhibition of the uridylylation of primer protein VPg (the initial step of picornavirus RNA synthesis) by 5-fluorouridine-triphosphate (FUTP), in addition to a mutagenic activity of FUTP during RNA elongation (Agudo et al., 2008). In the case of ribavirin, the situation is more complex since the involvement of many cellular functions in HCV replication (in reality in the replication of any virus), does not allow excluding the participation of any of the six mechanisms listed in the previous paragraph in its anti-HCV activity. In particular, it would be interesting to reexamine the evidence for inhibition of viral polymerases to ascertain that the inhibition is independent of a mutagenic activity.",

            "text": "In my group we favor lethal mutagenesis as being part of the antiviral activity of ribavirin against HCV, without excluding the participation of other mechanisms in vivo. The main arguments on which our preference is based are: in the study by (Dietz et al., 2013) that involved next generation sequencing (NGS) analyses of HCV from patients subjected to ribavirin monotherapy, the virus showed the mutational bias expected from ribavirin mutagenesis. A second argument is the consistent ribavirin mutagenesis of HCV observed in cell culture that could not be accounted for by GTP depletion (see Ortega-Prieto et al., 2013 and references therein). It has been suggested that in cell culture experiments the concentrations of ribavirin used are not attainable in vivo. Until measurements of the concentration of ribavirin nucleotides at the HCV replication complexes are available, it cannot be concluded that ribavirin concentrations in vivo are incompatible with mutagenesis; also, a broad range of ribavirin concentration in human serum have been reported during treatment (discussion and references in Ortega-Prieto et al., 2013). Furthermore, there are several reasons to miss a mutagenic activity in vivo with current analytical procedures. Ribavirin produced transient expansions followed by compression of mutant spectrum complexity in model studies with FMDV in cell culture (Ojosnegros et al., 2008, Perales et al., 2011b) (Figure 9.9\n). A possible interpretation is that when the mutational load due to ribavirin mutagenesis surpasses some critical value, increasingly defective genomes cease to contribute to progeny, therefore, resulting in mutant spectrum compression. The compression can be viewed as a mutagenesis-mediated bottleneck-associated reduction of complexity. Additional variations in FMDV mutant spectrum complexity were observed upon other mutagenic treatments and their interruption (discussed in Ojosnegros et al., 2008).",

Thus, even during ribavirin treatment alteration of mutant spectrum complexity may be missed depending on the time after treatment onset at which the viral sample is obtained. Also, it is necessary to quantify the amount of viral RNA to ensure that the sequence analyses either by standard molecular cloning-Sanger sequencing or NGS provide a faithful representation of the biological sample (see Section 3.6.4 in Chapter 3). Biases in the quantification of mutant spectrum complexity due to limitation in the initial amount of viral nucleic acid cannot be excluded unless sufficient methodological detail is described. Finally, in our view it is unlikely that a mutagenic activity readily observed in cell culture may be totally absent and bear no relationship with the activity of ribavirin in vivo, even though other mechanisms of ribavirin action can also be involved.",

The ribavirin resistance, fidelity-enhancing PV substitution G64S in 3D was obtained independently in two different laboratories (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003, Castro et al., 2005). This suggested that PV may have a very restricted number of mutations to attain ribavirin resistance, despite ample evidence that viruses generally display alternative pathways toward resistance to nonmutagenic inhibitors (Section 8.4.5 in Chapter 8). When FMDV whose polymerase is closely related to that of PV (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2004) was passaged in the presence of ribavirin, replacement G62S (the one equivalent to G64S in PV) was not selected. Instead, the 3D substitution selected was M296I (Sierra et al., 2007). A mutant FMDV encoding G62S in 3D that was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, displayed a strong selective disadvantage relative to the standard virus, that was partially compensated by the presence of M296I. The mutant reverted upon passage in cell culture while FMDV with substitution M296I in 3D was stable (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2010). The comparison of the enzymological properties of the FMDV polymerase (3D) with either G62S, M296I, or both indicated that G62S impairs RNA binding, RNA polymerization, and the incorporation of RMP into RNA. Therefore, despite G62S being of potential benefit for the replication of FMDV in the presence of ribavirin, its selection would be abortive. Despite the sites of substitution G62S and M296I being separated by 13.1 angstroms, a network of interactions allowed a cross influence between the two sites, with an effect on the catalytic domain of the enzyme (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2010). Thus, due to distance effects and the subtle, sequence-dependent network connections among residues within the polymerase molecule, the same amino acid replacement may have disparate and unpredictable effects on the behavior of closely related polymerases.",

Passage of the 3D M296I mutant virus in the presence of larger concentrations of ribavirin, resulted in selection of two additional substitutions, P44S and P169S, to yield a virus with the triple substitution P44S, P169S, and M296I in 3D; this triple mutant was termed SSI (Agudo et al., 2010). The selective strength of the triple mutant measured in the presence of 800 \u03bcM ribavirin was 18.3, 2.4-fold higher that the selective strength conferred by M296I alone. Significantly, the most salient biochemical feature displayed by the mutant polymerase was that P44S restricted the incorporation of RMP more strongly opposite C than opposite U in a number of in vitro incorporation assays. As a consequence, during replication in the presence of ribavirin, mutant SSI could maintain a balance of the different transition types [measured as the ratio of (G \u2192 A) + (C \u2192 U) to (A \u2192 G) + (U \u2192 C) mutations] typical of the standard virus when replicating in the absence of mutagens (Agudo et al., 2010) (see Figure 9.8 for the ribavirin-mediated mutational pathways). The modulation mechanism associated with 3D substitution P44S in FMDV is one of the mutagen resistance mechanisms listed in Box 9.3. Modulation of transition types allows the virus to maintain its typical mutant spectrum complexity with its corresponding adaptability. Interestingly, substitution P169S contributed a selective advantage only in the presence of very high (5000 \u03bcM) ribavirin concentrations, once the transition-modulating phenotype through P44S had already been acquired. Box 9.3 lists also as mutations contributing to mutagen escape those that increase fitness without being bona fide resistance mutations. Comparison of the fitness-enhancing mutations described for antiviral resistance (Chapter 8) and the effect of P169S in 3D of FMDV suggests that such mutations can be divided in two classes: those that increase fitness generally and those that do so only in the presence of mutagen and even in the presence of some range of mutagen concentrations (Agudo et al., 2010).",

Amino acid substitutions within the NLS that diminished the transport to the nucleus of 3D and 3D3C (a functional precursor intermediate of 3D and the protease 3C) modified also the template binding and nucleotide recognition properties of 3D (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2015). Interestingly, some replacements within the NLS increased the incorporation of RMP relative to standard substrates, suggesting that structural alterations in viral polymerases may enhance the vulnerability of viruses to nucleotide analogs. Despite uncertainties repeatedly exposed in this book (dependence of enzyme behavior on the protein and template sequence context, behavior modifications due to introduction of additional amino acid substitutions, etc.) it can be envisaged that through structure-based designs, new drugs could be found that enhance the incorporation of mutagenic nucleotides and contribute to new antiviral combinations.

The viral replicative machineries consist of a complex of several viral and host proteins, and it has been shown that proteins other than the polymerase can also contribute to polymerase fidelity and resistance to mutagenic agents (Box 9.3). The possibility that the read through protein of bacteriophage Q\u03b2 may contribute to 5-AZA-C resistance was suggested by a study of E. L\u00e1zaro and colleagues (Arribas et al., 2011), although limited amino acid substitutions in the viral replicase can confer resistance (Cabanillas et al., 2014). The small, nonenzymatic coronavirus nonstructural protein 10 is involved in maintaining the replication fidelity of the virus (Smith et al., 2015). Two substitutions in protein NS5A of an HCV replicon conferred low-level resistance to ribavirin (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005b). In the case of the DNA bacteriophage \u03d5X174 that does not encode its own polymerase, FU resistance was achieved through substitutions in the virus-coded lysis protein (Pereira-Gomez and Sanjuan, 2014). It was proposed that delayed cell lysis, increase in the amount of progeny virus per cell, and limitation of the number of infectious cycles reduced the chances of mutagenesis. Therefore, current evidence anticipates multiple adaptive mechanisms of virus resistance to mutagenic nucleotides, not necessarily confined to the polymerase as documented for standard inhibitors. There is, however, an interesting possibility of an initial advantage of mutagenic agents over standard inhibitors to impede selection of resistant mutants. Before justifying this suggestion, current therapeutic alternatives based on lethal mutagenesis are discussed.",

That is, the main effect of ribavirin was to shift the dominant part of the mutant spectrum into an A, U-rich region. This shift may increase the presence of defective genomes, including defectors (Section 9.3.1). We encounter here again one of the main departures introduced by quasispecies in the understanding of virus evolution: replacement of some genome subpopulations by others. In the case of extinction, the movement consists in the replacement of standard subpopulations by others lying in unfavorable portions of sequence space.

It depends on the location of the mutations. Accumulation of mutations may reduce fitness and robustness to the effect of additional mutations (Section 6.7.1 in Chapter 6) but still allow replicative competence. A FMDV clone subjected to multiple plaque-to-plaque transfers accumulates mutations at a rate of 0.1-0.25 mutations per passage, and viable genomes can accumulate a number of mutations equivalent to a mutation frequency of 10\u2212 2 substitutions per nucleotide (Escarm\u00eds et al., 2008). A 10-fold lower mutation frequency is sufficient to extinguish the same viral clone upon passage in the presence of a mutagenic agent. The tempo and mode of accumulation of mutations is the determinant factor. E. L\u00e1zaro and colleagues showed that 5-AZA-C enhanced Q\u03b2 replication during plaque development, but drove the virus to extinction during growth in liquid culture medium, unless a mutagen-resistant Q\u03b2 was selected (Cases-Gonzalez et al., 2008, Arribas et al., 2011). The experimental design in the plaque transfers is such that at each transfer a viral particle capable of developing a visible plaque on the cell monolayer is rescued no matter how many companions are left behind (extinguished). The applied selection is powerful. In contrast, during mutagenesis without intervening plaque isolations, no means to recover viable minority survivors are included in the design: if a rare potential survivor with a cluster of mutations arises transiently, it will soon perish due to the next rounds of mutagenesis, or will be suppressed by the surrounding mutant spectrum. Thus, even if beneficial mutations are more likely to arise in low-fitness genomes, their contribution to survival is minimal under a mutagenic environment.",

            "text": "As a test of the paradigm of the general advantage of combination therapies over monotherapy, initial experiments were designed to study the efficacy of a combination of a mutagenic agent and an antiviral inhibitor. The results documented that extinction of high-fitness FMDV or HIV-1 could be achieved by a combination of a mutagenic agent and a nonmutagenic inhibitor, but not with the mutagenic agent alone (Pariente et al., 2001, Pariente et al., 2005, Tapia et al., 2005). Despite being an expected result, additional experiments pursued by C. Perales with FMDV demonstrated that the response of the virus to the combined action of an inhibitor and a mutagenic agent is a bit more complex than initially thought. The critical comparative experiment was performed by C. Perales, and it is shown in Figure 9.10\n. The production of infectivity and viral RNA was measured in the course of viral passages in the presence of the inhibitor guanidinium chloride alone, or ribavirin alone, or a combination of guanidinium chloride and ribavirin, or with an initial passage in the presence of guanidinium chloride, followed by passages in the presence of ribavirin alone (Figure 9.10a). The results of quantification of FMDV progeny and a sensitive RT-PCR test of virus extinction, documented that the design consisting of administering guanidine alone first, followed by additional passages in the presence of ribavirin alone was the most effective to reduce progeny production and to drive the virus toward extinction (Figure 9.10b\u2013e) (Perales et al., 2009b). S. Manrubia developed a theoretical model whose main parameters were the concentration of standard and defective viruses sensitive and resistant to the inhibitor, the viral mutation rate, the rate of generation of inhibitor-resistant mutants, the number of standard and defective progeny genomes, and the number of infected cells and of infectious cycles per cell. The model (described in Perales et al., 2009b, Iranzo et al., 2011) explained the advantage of the sequential inhibitor-mutagen administration protocol over the corresponding combination. When an inhibitor and a mutagen are present together during viral replication, their joint influence on the viral RNA may jeopardize virus extinction. Some possible mechanisms of interaction between inhibitors and mutagenic agents are summarized in Box 9.4\n. The first of the points listed in Box 9.4 concerns us here: the presence of the mutagen may increase transiently the frequency of inhibitor-resistant mutants, therefore, favoring virus escape and treatment failure. A second mechanism by which the simultaneous presence of an inhibitor and mutagen can impede virus extinction is that in the presence of the inhibitor, the RNA defectors that are generated by mutagenesis of the viral RNA cannot interfere with viral replication. The reason is that defector replication is needed for lethal defection (Section 9.3.1), presumably because replication increases the amount of RNA that encodes trans-acting substituted proteins that are detrimental to the virus life cycle, and responsible for lethal defection.Box 9.4Interactions Between Inhibitors and Mutagenic Nucleotides That Can Affect the Efficacy of Combination Treatments\n\u2022A mutagen can increase the frequency of inhibitor-resistant mutants.\u2022An inhibitor can prevent replication of interfering mutants that contribute to lethal defection.\u2022The mutant spectrum can suppress inhibitor-resistant mutants that affect a trans-complementable protein.\u2022A mutagenized mutant spectrum can suppress high-fitness genomes.\nSee text for justification and references.",

            "text": "The advantage of sequential inhibitor-mutagen administration has been evidenced also with LCMV, taking advantage of the double inhibitor and mutagenic character of ribavirin, that depends on its concentration (Moreno et al., 2012). The model that supports the advantage of sequential treatments predicts that such an advantage depends on set of replicative parameters of the virus and on the intensity of inhibition and mutagenesis (Iranzo et al., 2011, Perales et al., 2012). For each virus-host system, it will be necessary to carry out experiments to delimit the range of inhibitor and mutagen concentrations at which the sequential treatment is advantageous. The translation into clinical practice is of interest, but it will have the added complications derived from target compartmentalization and uneven inhibitor and mutagen concentrations in different compartments (Steinmeyer and Wilke, 2009). The model studies by S. Manrubia and J. Iranzo predict also that when therapy is based on the use of either two mutagenic agents or two inhibitors, a combination treatment is always preferred over the sequential. Only a few studies have investigated the consequences of using two mutagens together, with or without inhibitors (Perales et al., 2009a, Dapp et al., 2012). The availability of two or more virus-specific mutagen agents of different mutational preferences has the advantage that they will target different regions of sequence space (related to network connections discussed in Chapter 10), although the resulting mutational patterns may be difficult to interpret (Dapp et al., 2012). Also, a mutagen may extinguish a virus that has acquired resistance to another mutagen as in the extinction of a ribavirin-resistant FMDV mutant by FU (Perales et al., 2009a). According to the model, the worst option is to administer first a mutagen and then an inhibitor. Unless the mutagen achieves extreme reductions of viral load, it may generate an expanded mutant spectrum from which inhibitor-resistant mutants may be selected (Iranzo et al., 2011, Perales et al., 2012).",

They exert nucleic acid editing functions used by the cell that can be recruited as antiviral responses (Harris and Dudley, 2015). Editing is part of replication cycle of several viruses. It has been suggested that Paramyxovirinae might have evolved to possess a genome of polyhexameric length (known as the \u201crule of six\u201d) to avoid uncontrolled editing and error catastrophe of the virus (Kolakofsky et al., 2005). There are additional mutagenic-like activities that mimic lethal mutagenesis. One of them is termed RIP (repeat-induced point mutations) that operates in some filamentous fungi to mutate genetic intruders, including transposable elements (Galagan and Selker, 2004, Clutterbuck, 2011, Braga et al., 2014, Amselem et al., 2015).

There is an additional parameter that should also be considered: the spectrum of antiviral activity, regarding the number of unrelated viral pathogens that are effectively inhibited by the treatment. Although evidence is still lacking, the possibility that broad-spectrum in the above sense may predict a capacity to inhibit broad repertoires of quasispecies swarms is appealing. The broadness of antiviral activity is basically dependent on the mechanism of antiviral activity. In this chapter and in the preceding chapter, we have described two classes of broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitors: those that stimulate the innate immune response (notably inhibitors of pyrimidine biosynthesis) and mutagenic nucleotide analogs (notably ribavirin and favipiravir as the most relevant examples, likely to be followed by additional ones). Thus, it would be interesting to investigate the joint use of these two classes of compounds (stimulators of immune responses and lethal mutagens) in sequential or combination protocols of the type described in Section 9.8.",

The size of the three spheres quantifies in an approximate manner the complexity of the mutant spectrum, following the average distance parameter used to quantify genome subpopulations in the partition analysis of quasispecies (PAQ) clustering procedure of Baccam et al. (2001). The amplitude of the mutant spectrum increased first, but then it was compressed to a significant extent. The scheme is based on data reported in (Ojosnegros et al., 2008) and possible interpretations and implications are discussed in the text.",

            "text": "Figure 9.10: Alternative antiviral designs using an inhibitor and a mutagenic agent. This model study was carried out with FMDV replicating in BHK-21 cells. The inhibitor used was guanidine hydrochloride (GU), and the mutagen was ribavirin (R). (a) The four types of serial passages (p indicates passage number) are, from top to bottom: passages in the presence of guanidine alone (yellow diamond); passages in the presence of ribavirin (R) alone (red triangle); passages in the presence of a mixture of GU and R (denoted as [+ GU + R]; red star; passage number is in quotes because the first passage with the mixture of GU and R was considered equivalent to the second passage in the presence of a single drug); finally, a first passage in the presence of GU, followed by four passages in the presence of R (blue circle). (b), (c), (d) Virus titer and viral RNA level in the course of six passages in the presence of 5 mM R and 16, 18, 20 mM GU in (b), (c), (d), respectively, with passage regimen code indicated in the box. Note that the highest reductions of FMDV progeny production are achieved using the sequential GU-R protocol (blue circles) and that infectivity and viral RNA are lost earlier at the highest GU concentration tested. (e) A highly sensitive RT-PCR amplification used as diagnostic of viral extinction confirmed the advantage of the sequential GU-ribavirin treatment. Symbols are as in (a).",
