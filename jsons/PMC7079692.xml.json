            "text": "In recent years, three coronaviruses (CoV) have emerged to have a significant impact on global health and the global economy. Two of these, which cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS [1]) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS [2\u20135]), are human pathogens. The SARS outbreak in 2002\u20132003 led to 8096 cases, with 10 % mortality in 27 countries [6]. Since September 2012, about 1900 cases of MERS have been reported, with a mortality rate of about 35 % [7]. The third coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhoea coronavirus (PED-CoV [8]), was introduced into North American commercial pig herds and led to an economic loss of almost 2 billion dollars in the United States [9]. These three coronaviruses are believed to have spilled over from bats, because similar coronaviruses have been detected in bats [10, 11]. Interestingly, while coronaviruses cause serious and often fatal disease in their secondary hosts, such coronaviruses do not cause any clinical disease in their putative reservoir hosts, i.e. bats [12\u201314]. The reasons for this difference in outcomes for coronavirus infection, and the factors that lead to virus spillover, are not clearly understood. There are numerous studies on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and PED-CoV in humans and pigs [15\u201318], but there are few reports examining coronavirus interactions with their primary bat hosts [13, 14]. Our goal was, therefore, to identify coronaviruses in a common and widespread North American bat species and study virus\u2013bat interactions within this species.",

Our results suggest that about a third of little brown bats are infected with several distinct clades of an Alphacoronavirus, and that the bats retain the virus for up to 4 months of hibernation. Since the bats we examined had been maintained as groups in isolated incubators or semi-isolated cages, we were able to test the hypothesis that little brown bats in the wild are infected with closely related variants of a coronavirus. We predicted that, since the bats were randomly assigned to different incubators/cages, (1) prevalence of infection should be similar across incubators and cages, and (2) any variation in viral genomes should be evenly distributed among cages and incubators.",

We included a corresponding segment from little brown bat coronavirus (KF430219) and from the Rocky Mountain coronavirus detected in a big brown bat (HQ336976) into the alignments. The sequences segregated into two distinct clades (Fig. 1a). The clade 1 sequences were most similar to KF430219 and the clade 2 sequences resembled sequences from HQ336976. Most of the sequence differences within each clade were synonymous (Fig. 1b), while there were seven amino acid differences between clades 1 and 2 (Fig. 1c). Except for some bats in incubator D, the nucleotide inter-clade and intra-clade polymorphisms were scattered among the hibernation incubators. This suggested that the bats were infected before being placed in the incubators, rather than acquiring infection from the incubator or cage mates.",

Circumstantial evidence suggests that most alpha and beta coronaviruses parasitizing other mammals may also have originated in bats [23].

In this study, we examined a coronavirus in its natural host, the little brown bat. This study system provides a useful model for understanding factors that may promote spillovers. Our results suggest the following: (a) the Myotis coronavirus (Myl-CoV) is mainly present in the intestines and lungs; (b) co-hibernating little and big brown bats may share closely related coronaviruses; (c) Myl-CoV can persist in M. lucifugus for up to 4 months, the hibernation period of our experiment; and (d) the presence of Myl-CoV in bronchial epithelium is associated with minimal pathology or inflammation. However, a larger sample size under controlled conditions of exposure, with more rapid fixation of tissues, is required to fully characterize the lesions in lung and intestines.",

[24] and others [20] previously detected a coronavirus in little and big brown bats, suggesting that the virus may infect bats of both species, crossing between the bats at shared co-hibernation sites. The virus originally detected in a big brown bat was named the Rocky Mountain coronavirus [24] for the location of its initial detection. The RNA amplified from little brown bats in this study appeared to be from two distinct clades. The sequences in clade 1 were very similar to the archived sequence derived from little brown bats and the sequences from clade 2 were more closely related to the archived sequence from big brown bats. This suggests that two closely related coronaviruses may circulate in little brown bats. Although the sequence traces did not suggest a mixture of PCR products, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the individual bats were infected with viruses from both clades, and that the PCR likely favoured the predominant viral component.",

These include: (1) a continuous source of susceptible hosts for viruses that cause short-term acute infections with long-lasting immunity (e.g. measles virus); (2) antigenic drift (e.g. influenza virus) of virus or waning immunity (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus) that allows reinfection; and (3) long-lasting latent (e.g. herpesviruses) or persistent infections (e.g. pestiviruses) with sustained or periodic shedding. How bat viruses are maintained in their natural host populations, or how they avoid extinction as host populations become immune and less susceptible, however, is not understood. It is possible to establish persistent infections in cultured cells with viruses that may have originated in bats, including Ebola virus [25] and SARS-CoV [26, 27], but whether these viruses persist in their primary hosts is not known. The results of studies aimed at determining whether bat viruses persist in infected bats are controversial. There is no direct evidence for either persistence or transmission dynamics, and this is a knowledge gap in bat-virus ecology that needs to be addressed [28].",

Most of the intra- and inter-clade polymorphisms exceeded this rate. Also, while the viruses detected in 2011 were primarily clade 1 and the 2012 viruses were primarily clade 2, both clades were detected in samples from either year. The differences between clades likely represent fixed nucleotide polymorphisms rather than random changes. Although recombination of coronavirus clades is possible, performing deep sequencing on the samples would enable us to negate this possibility.

They concluded that these coronaviruses do not persist in their hosts, but are maintained in populations by the introduction of new susceptible individuals. Their results, however, do not rule out persistence in individual animals with low levels of virus replication and undetectable shedding, interspersed with short periods of increased replication and shedding. Our observations suggest that the Myl-CoV can persist in its hosts for at least the 4-month hibernation period. Due to strict biosecurity, spread of virus between incubators was unlikely and the distribution of variants among incubators (and cages) argues against spread within incubators (or cages).

Firstly, we observed that the cells that were infected showed degenerative changes that resulted in rare multifocal areas of bronchiolar epithelial erosions, with no obvious inflammation targeting these lesions. The absence of neutrophilic infiltration is contrary to what has been seen in non-bat species affected by similar coronaviruses. Previous studies in transgenic mice showed that HCoV-229E infection led to massive neutrophilic infiltrate [31]. Lung samples from piglets infected with PED-CoV showed the presence of moderate neutrophilic infiltrate (even though PED-CoV has a predilection for intestines) [32]. Hibernating bats do appear to be capable of a local inflammatory response following fungal infection [33]. A low level of neutrophilic infiltration in coronavirus-infected lungs reinforces the fact that bats are unique in the way that they respond to a coronavirus infection. Lower inflammation might be due to fewer chemotactic factors being produced as a result of infection, which might be an inherent feature of M. lucifugus. It might also be that bat neutrophils are more efficient at controlling virus infection and obviating a massive neutrophilic infiltrate. An alternative explanation for the lack of inflammation in bats may be that cell necrosis occurs at the epithelial surface, with dead cells sloughing into the lumen. The cytokines required to stimulate inflammation and immunity might not enter the interstitium and the systemic circulation. An infection that is localized to epithelial cells without breaching the basement membrane is a good strategy for a virus to allow persistence of infection. However, in our study the sample size was small and it is difficult to reach a firm conclusion about the host\u2019s response to coronavirus infection.",

One ml of Halt protease and phosphate inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, cat. #78440) and EDTA was added and the blob of bacteria was sonicated for 60 s on ice. The supernatant was removed after centrifuging the bacteria at 15 000 r.p.m. in a Thermo F18 12\u00d750 rotor (32 000 g) for 20 min and the pellet was treated with 1.5 % N-lauroylsarcosine (Sigma L-9150) to further disrupt the cells and then added onto the supernatant. From later SDS-PAGE analysis, we learned that the N-lauroylsarcosine treatment of the pellet led to the release of fusion protein from the cell. Fusion protein was purified from the supernatant using glutathione\u2013Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare), followed by elution using 10 mM glutathione for 16 h. Elution was performed twice to obtain protein concentrations of 6.1 and 4.3 mg ml\u22121. The protein was verified using SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1a, available with the online Supplementary Material).",
