The worldwide reported incidence varies on a geographical basis, from 0.7 per 1000 in USA to 4.0 per 1000 in Australia [2]. JIA is a heterogeneous group of inflammatory disorders primarily affecting the musculoskeletal system. The most common symptoms of JIA are persistent joint swelling, pain and stiffness. JIA normally affects the load bearing joints of the knee and foot, with movement limited by pain [3]. Adverse outcomes can present to varying degrees regardless of disease subtype, but persistently inflamed joints are a major risk factor [4]. The main outcomes include limitation of joint function, joint structural damage due to erosions and in severe cases disability or death. JIA subtypes vary considerably in the pattern and severity of joint inflammation, disease progression and outcome.",

To effectively manage and minimize the effects of recurrent synovitis however, an early and accurate diagnosis is essential [7]. Successful clinical management can be induced in most (54%) JIA patients with polyarticular disease, using combined anti-inflammatory treatment (NSAID and Methotrexate MTX) [8]. Even so, nearly half the patients will have relapses after treatment is discontinued. The rate of relapses may be influenced by residual synovial inflammation at the time when immunosuppressive treatment is withdrawn. Once the disease is in clinical remission, it is important to know when it is possible to withdraw immunosuppressive drugs, without inducing a flare because of their potentially serious side effects [9]. For a clinician there are three main concerns: maintaining disease remission, prevention and pre-empting disease spread and ultimately averting permanent joint damage and disability. If there was a predictive test that would allow disease progression to be forecast and therefore modify treatment accordingly, significant benefit could be provided to patients.",

Our pilot study uncovered fragments of extracellular matrix and T-cell receptor proteins, products of the degradative proteolytic environs of the recurrently inflamed knee [13].

What is clear though, is that no single agent or process is wholly responsible, but rather the interaction of these processes resulting in a characteristic protein expression pattern with a particular inflammatory nature. Proteomics is therefore an ideal systems biology approach to examine the multifaceted processes at work in arthritis [15]. In addition multiplex diagnostics are more likely to reflect the true complexity of the arthritis disease process. Fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) was applied in this study as the spectrally distinct Cy dye fluorophores permit multiplexing of corresponding synovial fluid and plasma from an individual patient. The inclusion of an internal pooled standard (composed of all experiment samples), on each gel allows proteome comparisons to be made between patients and biological variation between body fluids to be reliably quantified.",

On the other hand it is equally important to assess the systemic molecular foundations of the disease, which may not be clinically apparent. From a practicality viewpoint it is also preferable to be able to quantify biomarkers in plasma as it is more easily accessed with less trauma to children in particular, who may suffer repeated bouts of joint inflammation. The plasma proteome is not only composed of haemostatic proteins confined to the vascular system but also transient secretions of proteins from tissues as a part of normal developmental/aging processes or disease. The proteomic profile of plasma therefore encodes the physiological state of the tissues it is circulated around. However many authors caution that the most meaningful diagnostic plasma proteins are also likely to be found at the lowest abundance, since they are released from tissue into the blood with temporal and spatial restrictions [16]. Moving further upstream of plasma to a biofluid proximal to the disease site is therefore likely to be more fruitful in the initial phases of biomarker candidate discovery.",

An internal pooled standard was generated by combining equal amounts of all matched synovial fluid and plasma samples, followed by Cy2 dye labelling. Equal amounts (50 \u00b5g) of Cy5 and Cy3 samples and Cy2 standard were combined and resuspended in an equal volume of 2\u00d7 sample buffer (8 M Urea, 130 mM DTT, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 2% (v/v) Pharmalyte\u2122 4\u20137). Rehydration buffer (8 M Urea, 13 mM DTT, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 1% (v/v) Pharmalyte\u2122 4\u20137) was added to make up the volume to 450 ml prior to IEF. Each sample was applied to a 24 cm Immobiline DryStrip pH 4\u20137 linear immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strip and re-hydrated overnight. Previous runs with pH 3\u201310 carrier ampholytes and IPG strips revealed most of the proteins focused within the pH 4\u20137 range [15]. The first dimension separation of proteins by isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed for a total of 75,000 Vh (2 mA/5 W limit per strip) including a final 8000 V step for 1 h to obtain high quality resolution.",

Continuous drainage from and replenishment into the intra-articular space ensures the synovial fluid proteome remains in flux [33]. Although capillary ultrafiltrate is the base solution for synovial fluid, secretions are made by the local synovial lining cells. Size selectivity has been proposed on the theory that the hyaluronan lining the synovial space is able to filter proteins such as albumin by steric exclusion [35]. The rate of trans-synovial fluid loss and molecular sieving effects are determined by the chain length of hyaluronan concentrated at the synovial membrane surface [36]. Our observation of albumin isoforms at variable stages of degradation across synovial fluid and plasma may reflect molecular sieving between the synovial endothelium and the joint fluid or a differential rate of degradation between the two fluids.",

The data provided indicates that synovial fluid proteome profiles could be used to classify patients based on existing clinical definitions. By virtue of the definition of the extended oligoarticular patient subgroup (become polyarticular after 6 months of initial diagnosis) we consider that both prediction of disease evolution and subgroup discrimination are possible by the proposed protein biomarker panel. The ability to predict disease course would be a powerful tool in the limitation of adverse outcome such as disease extension, as it may flag such patients for more effective/aggressive treatment strategies at an earlier stage in the disease process than is currently possible. The authors consider the collection of samples at the earliest stage in the disease course an important feature of the current study and vital in the discovery of biomarkers which not only \u2018describe\u2019 the initial disease processes, but may also act as sentinels to predict subsequent disease outcome. By cataloguing the protein profiles and identities which best describe the joint status as disease progresses, it may also be possible to monitor therapeutic response over time. Furthermore joint proteome records could help predict disease spread and joint damage. Considering the heterogeneity of patient outcome in JIA, therapeutic suppression of synovial joint inflammation, while neglecting the systemic components of chronic disease, may not represent the best possible way to manage non-responsive disease. Longer lasting remission could be possible by taking systemic sentinels into account.",
