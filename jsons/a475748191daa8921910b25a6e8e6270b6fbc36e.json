Community-based services might use domiciliary visits, consultations in healthcare settings, or remote consultations. Services might also alter direct contact between clinicians. Aims. We examined the effects of appointment types and clinician-clinician encounters upon infection rates. Methods. We modelled a COVID-19-like disease in a hypothetical community healthcare team, their patients, and patients' household contacts (family). In one condition, clinicians met patients and briefly met family (e.g. home visit or collateral history). In another, patients attended alone (e.g. clinic visit), segregated from each other. In another, face-to-face contact was eliminated (e.g. videoconferencing). We also varied clinician-clinician contact; baseline and ongoing \"external\" infection rates; whether overt symptoms reduced transmission risk behaviourally (e.g. via personal protective equipment, PPE); and household clustering. Results. Service organization had minimal effects on whole-population infection under our assumptions but materially affected clinician infection.",

We discuss infection control and other factors affecting appointment choice and team organization. Conclusions. Distancing between clinicians can have significant effects on team infection. Loss of clinicians to infection likely has an adverse impact on care, not modelled here. Appointments must account for clinical necessity as well as infection control. Interventions to reduce transmission risk can synergize, arguing for maximal distancing and behavioural measures (e.g. PPE) consistent with safe care. : medRxiv preprint We thank Mai Wong, Ruaidhri McCormack, Petra Vertes, Hisham Ziauddeen, and Carol Brayne for helpful discussion.",

The UK implemented interpersonal distancing on 16 March 2020 and \"lockdown\" on 23 March; its National Health Service (NHS) has reduced non-critical work and moved towards videoconferencing and telephone assessments where possible (1) . However, some face-to-face consultations remain necessary, including for urgent mental or physical health needs. For community-based health services -including physical care teams, community mental health teams (CMHTs), mental health crisis teams, and other urgent care servicesthis raises the important question of how to structure patient contacts and clinical teams to minimize infection.",

We tested the robustness of these effects by varying other inputs to summarize a wide range of unknown factors, such as the baseline and ongoing infection rates, and a form of inter-patient association or clustering. Furthermore, clinical care has competing objectives: to deliver optimal healthcare, to safeguard patients and staff from infection, to ensure the service is robust to staff shortages, to provide continuity of care, etc. An action that improves infection control may have other adverse effects. We did not model a mixed objective function explicitly. Instead, we focus on infection rates (including clinician infection rates) and discuss other potential effects of the service-level manipulations examined.",

We examined whether the effects of appointment type and clinician meetings depended on the degree of patient clustering in such \"hubs\", which we modelled as large households with multiple patients and their virtual \"families\" (or, similarly, care staff). We implemented this simply, by aggregating virtual households: thus, n=1 patients plus their family (household) per cluster as in Experiment 1, or n=2 households per cluster, etc. For simplicity, all co-residents were assumed to interact with each other, as patients and family would in a single-patient household, and clinicians were assumed to have \"family-level\" contact with everyone else in the cluster during FC-type visits.

Combined risk reduction methods interacted with each other, sometimes having more than a multiplicative effect, and were disproportionately more effective than each alone. All these effects lessened with increasing rates of infection from outside the modelled population. Patient clustering increased wholepopulation infection and magnified the effect of appointment type on clinician infection, even for \"patientonly\" appointments. In our model, it was possible for multiple clinicians to visit a cluster; restricting which clinicians visit which clusters may be another important factor to consider. Clustering or \"hub\" effects may also occur in other ways not modelled here -such as patients being in receipt of multiple services from one or several provider organizations -and would similarly serve to increase transmission further. Changes in \"lockdown\" practices may affect external infection rates or clustering, requiring services to adapt to changing public health policy. Multiple small improvements in infection control can have a total effect greater than the sum of its parts (Figure 2E) .",

Reducing contact between staff may be practical. Dividing a clinical team into subteams may provide partial benefits ( Table 2) . Fomite transmission is also a risk to clinical teams: precautions available to clinical teams against fomite transmission overlap with but have some distinct elements from those for airborne transmission ( Table 2) .",

In the \"family contact\" (e.g. home visit) condition, we made assumptions about the duration of contact with family members, including that this plausibly encompassed the degree of surface as well as airborne transmission, and we assumed clinicians were not fomite vectors for direct transfer of virus between homes. In the \"patient only\" (e.g. clinic) condition, we assumed full segregation and cleaning between patients, with no inter-patient virus transfer. In the \"no clinicians meeting\" condition, we assumed a lack of fomite transmission between clinicians. Any of these may be unrealistic. Fomite transmission in either situation would likely increase infection rates and alter the impact of appointment type upon infection.

(A) Individual people followed a \"susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered\" model, with full immunity after recovery. Whether an infected person developed symptoms or not was probabilistic (see Methods) and if they developed symptoms, this occurred slightly after the infectious period began. (B) Interaction between people (see Methods). Solid lines show fixed interactions; dashed lines show interactions that were varied. Patients interacted with their household (family) members and family members interacted with each other. Family sizes varied. In different conditions, clinicians did or did not interact directly with each other. Clinicians interacted with their patients, except in the \"remote visit\" condition. In the \"family contact\" (e.g. home visit) condition, clinicians also interacted briefly with family (not all such interactions drawn). The initial level of infection and the rate of ongoing \"external\" infection (red arrows) were varied. Additional manipulations, not shown here, included whether symptoms altered infectiousness in a behavioural, protective way (in contrast to an ever-present biological exacerbating way) and, in Experiment 2, whether patient households were grouped together in larger clusters with mutual interaction. dotted line, 5% initially exposed). This effect underlies the synergy between measures that can be taken to reduce the transmission of infection: small changes in transmission risk sometimes cause dramatic changes in total infection.

A protective behavioural response to symptoms had a proportionally greater effect at lower external infection rates. (B) Appointment type and clinician meetings had more substantial effects on the infection of clinicians. Moving to lower-contact appointment types and reducing clinician meetings showed synergy with a protective behavioural response to symptoms. (C) Clustering patient households together increased whole-population transmission. (D) Clustering increased clinician infection and substantially magnified the effect of appointment type. The beneficial effect of eliminating face-to-face clinician-clinician meetings was proportionally greater in low-clustering conditions, but this effect was very small. \"Cluster size\" refers to the number of patients (and their virtual families, or care home staff) per interacting \"household\". (E) Changes in transmission rate have nonlinear effects on the total proportion of the population infected, shown in a deterministic standard SEIR model (solid line, 1% initially exposed;",
