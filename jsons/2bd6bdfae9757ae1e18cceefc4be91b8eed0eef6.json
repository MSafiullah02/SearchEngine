A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 capable to infect humans, emerged in mid-December 2019 in Wuhan, China, causing the novel disease COVID-19 [1]. Clinical manifestations of this viral infection vary from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory syndrome and death. The number of infected people and affected countries have quickly risen and already in March 2020, World Health Organization declared a pandemic [2]. Therefore, it became highly important to understand if specific human genes and genetic variants could be associated with susceptibility or resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection and how frequencies of these variants vary between different populations. Human genes usually associated with susceptibility and resistance to viral infection are those associated with the point of viral entry into the human host cells, such as genes encoding receptors, co-receptors and enzymes that modify receptors [3]. Furthermore, various genes involved in the immune response, such as virus sensing, signaling in response to virus, antiviral factors etc. have also been found to be important for the severity and the outcome of viral infections. A recent study which analyzed COVID-19 symptoms in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, reported that 50 (95% confidence intervals 29-70)% of the variance of 'predicted COVID-19' phenotype is due to genetic factors [4]. Deciphering the RNA sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome showed that this new virus belongs to lineage B betacoronaviruses, together with the SARS-CoV virus which emerged in 2002 [1].",

Majority of variants that emerged in such studies were located in non-coding parts of the human genome and their effect is observable in the fine tuning of the gene expression. Also, variants residing in coding regions, such as rs1800450 in MBL2 gene [6] were particularly interesting as they alter protein structure and function.",

However, a detailed study using computational prediction methods for protein structure analyses revealed that 17 variants in the coding regions of the ACE2 gene are located at positions important for the binding of ACE2 with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [21] . Based on these predictions, individuals carrying these variants would probably be resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, all these variants were rare (less than 0.00388 allele frequency) and interestingly enough their association with any human disease or disorder has never been reported [21] . Having in mind the rarity of variants that could directly influence the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, it is not surprising that comparative genetic analysis of the frequency of ACE2 variants in different populations did not predict the existence of individuals resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection [22] . ACE2 is not the only possible player that could influence the interaction between humans and SARS-CoV-2 virus. The furin could be the second important factor to contribute to high pathogenicity of the novel virus. Furthermore, we can learn from clinical experiences of the SARS-CoV-2 infection which showed that plasmin and other airway proteases could also be important for patients experiencing more severe form of . In addition, the knowledge based on SARS epidemic shows that MBL2 and OAS1 genes, involved in the innate immune response, could also modulate susceptibility to infection with betacoronaviruses.",

After SARS-CoV outbreak it was found that type I interferons could inhibit the replication of this virus and that these interferons further induce different proteins with antiviral activity [37] . One of such proteins is encoded by the OAS1 gene. OAS1 synthesizes 2',5'-oligoadenylates, and as a consequence activates latent RNase L which cuts single-stranded RNAs thus leading to the viral RNA degradation and inhibition of viral replication [38] . Three rare variants were detected in the OAS1 gene: p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His. Interestingly, human OAS1 protein recognizes two adjacent minor grooves of dsRNA with C-terminal lobe and N-terminal lobe, where the Arg47 residue is one of the residues involved in the recognition [39] . When analyzed in Swiss-Pdb Viewer, the side chain of Arg47 residue was predicted to form hydrogen bond with dsRNA, while a change to glutamine at this position was predicted to abolish this hydrogen bond. Furthermore, Gln at this position is predicted to form hydrogen bonds with Cys45 and Phe46, and also to cause steric clashes with Glu43 and Arg44. Nevertheless, variant p.Arg47Gln is predicted to be benign/tolerated by PolyPhen-2, SIFT and MutPred2 algorithms, so its effect on the OAS1 protein seems not to affect the structure itself, but it may be apparent upon the binding of the dsRNA.",

Variant p.Arg130His is predicted to be probably damaging/deleterious by prediction algorithms, and the analysis in Swiss-Pdb Viewer showed that in case of Arg130, a change to His at this position was predicted to result in the formation of novel hydrogen bonds with Thr188 and also a steric clash with Glu185. These rare variants may have an effect on the OAS1 structure and/or function through the formation of novel hydrogen bonds and steric clashes, leading to a less stable protein. In case of variants located at the protein/RNA interface formed upon the binding, its effects reflect on the formation of (to some extent) weaker bond with the RNA thus lowering its 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity, as it was shown that variants at the protein/RNA interface impair OAS1 activity by 60-to 2,500-fold [39] . Furthermore, having in mind that the active form of human OAS1 is tetrameric, any variant potentially impairing the oligomerization process would also have an effect on the activity of the enzyme, the synthesis of 2',5'-oligoadenylates, and consequently the activation of the latent RNase and the degradation of viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2. Knowing that variants in OAS1, such as p.Gly397Arg were previously associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection in some populations [5] , the effects of p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His might be interesting for further investigation.",

As a start loss variant, p.Met1Ile leads to start of the translation from the neighboring Met2 residue. Start loss variants can range from disease causing to benign start codon variants, so with the high frequency of p.Met1Ile in all analyzed populations,its effect is presumed to be benign. While variant p.Gln293Arg was described as a cumulative risk factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma[41], its effect on the protease activity and COVID-19 susceptibility remains to be elucidated. Four variants were found in genes involved in the innate immunity.
