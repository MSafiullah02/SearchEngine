This rhythm is endogenous, but can be entrained to a different cycle by the environment, e.g., changes in the light cycle (Johnson, 1992). The biological clock or circadian rhythm has been studied in eukaryotic microorganisms, plants, insects, and mammals (Aschoff, 1960, Rusak and Zucker, 1979, Edmunds, 1988). The biochemical mechanism of the biological clock is of fundamental importance in the regulation of many cellular systems (Morse et al., 1990). Although some progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of the biological clock, it is not yet completely understood.",

Sreebny and Johnson (1969) were the first to show that there is a diurnal variation in the secretion and storage of secretory proteins in the parotid gland of the rat. Rats are nocturnal animals that feed mostly during the night and rest during the daylight hours. The exocrine glands discharge the contents of secretory granules during feeding and there is a substantial decrease in the glandular stores of secretory proteins by the end of the night. The partial depletion of these proteins triggers an increase in the rate of synthesis. During the day, when the secretory protein content has been restored, the rate of synthesis decreases (Sreebny et al., 1971). Morphological studies of acinar cells of rat parotid glands revealed time-dependent changes in the structures of acinar cells (Albegger et al., 1975, Albegger et al., 1977). The maximum volume of the cells and the secretory granules occurs in the evening at the start of the eating cycle and the minimum volume is seen in the morning.",

            "text": "von Ebner\u2019s glands, also known as lingual serous glands, are exocrine glands in the oral cavity. They are minor salivary glands embedded in the muscle tissue of the tongue beneath the vallate papillae and foliate furrows (Hand, 1970, 1999). These glands secrete two digestive enzymes, lingual lipase and lingual amylase. Lingual lipase digests triacylglycerols at the acid pH of the stomach, producing diacyl- and monoacylglycerols and fatty acids. This preduodenal fat digestion is especially important when there is pancreatic insufficiency, as in the premature and neonatal animal, or in disease states such as cystic fibrosis (Field and Scow, 1983, Field and Hand, 1987, Field et al., 1989). von Ebner\u2019s glands differ from other minor salivary glands in that they are not muco- or mucoserous glands but serous glands in most species (Hand et al., 1999; see Nalavade and Varute, 1972 for exceptions). In addition, regulation of protein secretion from these glands is similar to the pancreas and different from the parotid gland. Major protein secretion in von Ebner\u2019s glands (Field and Hand, 1987) and the pancreas (Peikin et al., 1979) is stimulated by cholinergic agonists, whereas in the parotid gland proteins are secreted after \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation (Johnson and Sreebny, 1973, Garrett and Thulin, 1975). To our knowledge there have been no reports on circadian rhythm in von Ebner\u2019s glands.",

These selected slides were randomized and coded by a laboratory technician in order to ensure that all measurements were made blind. Areas of entire acinar cells and portions of these cells occupied by secretory granules were measured and tallied using Jandel\u2019s software SigmaScan by tracing the camera lucida images on a digitizing pad. The digitizing pad was calibrated to \u03bcm2. Ten acinar cells were measured on each slide. Only cells that both bordered a lumen and contained a nucleus were used.

The percentage of each a.m. or p.m. datum of the total values were calculated. For lingual lipase, under light/dark the percentage of enzyme activity remaining in the glands at the a.m. sampling, 34.7\u00b12.6, was significantly different from the p.m. sample, 65.3\u00b14.2, p=0.0001.

The p.m. samples under the different light conditions were significantly different, p=0.0002 and 0.0062 for lingual lipase and amylase, respectively. These results revealed that, under light/dark conditions, in the a.m. (after the dark period), enzyme activity in the gland has been depleted, however the p.m. enzyme activity has been replenished.

However, we cannot determine from our experiments exactly what phase changes in circadian rhythm actually occurred in the 7 days of continuous illumination. Siegel (1961) observed that with a normal light/dark cycle and ad libitum food and water intake, the maximum feeding of rats was during the dark hours. Under continuous light, this pattern was gone in 6 days, with more feeding during the usual daylight hours and less during the normal nightime hours. They also observed a return to the original feeding pattern by day 6 when the lighting conditions were returned to light/dark. Mice raised in continuous light have a displaced circadian rhythm with periods between 25.0 and 25.6 h (Aschoff, 1960). In addition, Rosenwasser et al. (1979), when measuring food consumption in rats under continuous illumination, found no difference in the daily total amount of food consumed whether in light/dark or continuous light, but in continuous light the rhythm was attenuated from 24 h in light/dark to 24.25\u201324.7 h.

However, we do not know whether light entrainment it affects enzyme synthesis and storage in von Ebner\u2019s gland per se or whether the morphological and enzyme changes we observed were a consequence of the changes in the eating cycle that was entrained by light. In a review article, Johnson (1992) has ennumerated many experiments that indicate that metabolic response to eating is not a response to circadian changes, but rather a response to feeding changes that are entrained by light. However, there has been some indication that some digestive enzyme secretion is independent of food consumption. In the rat exocrine pancreas, a minor cycle of secretion was found that was independent of food intake (Maouyo et al., 1993). Further experiments are needed to determine whether significant changes in morphology and enzyme secretion in von Ebner\u2019s glands might occur under light entrainment when food is withheld.",

Genes have been cloned that make protein components of the biochemical clock. Mutations in these genes have been shown to alter or even abolish circadian rhythms. Among these are per, tim and doubletime in Drosophila melanogaster (Young, 1998), frq in Neurospora crassa, (Aronson et al., 1994) and Clock in mice (Vitaterna et al., 1994). These studies will further clarify the genetic and biochemical factors that are involved in the pathway of light-entrained circadian rhythm.",
