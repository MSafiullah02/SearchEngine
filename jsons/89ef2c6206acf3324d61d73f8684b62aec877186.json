            "text": "An informal proposal has been made to group together a number of recently recognized viruses under the head of coronaviruses [I], They affect a variety of hosts causing a diversity of diseases, but they are grouped together mainly because they have similar electron microscopic appearances, are etherlabile, and probably contain RNA. However, remembering that influenza and parainfluenza viruses were once thought to be quite closely related on similar grounds, much of the grouping should be regarded as tentative. Nevertheless, murine strains (MHV) are antigenically related to some human strains and, morphologically, human, avian, and murine viruses replicate in a similar way; it is therefore likely that at least some of the groupings will be confirmed by further investigation. There is now some more detailed in formation on the structure of the prototype virus IBV (avian infectious bron chitis virus), the striking features being the large number of peptides and the large single RNA strand. Some strains possess hemagglutinin and there seems to be a hemagglutinin receptor-destroying enzyme which is not a neuramini dase ; also there is evidence of a viral RNA polymerase. These features confirm that IBV is quite distinct from other viruses. We still have no detailed infor mation about the biochemical characteristics of its nucleic acid, the process 1 Report of the Study Group on Coronavirus, Vertebrate Virus Subcommittee, Inter national Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Before the proposals become official, they require approval of the ICTV at its next meeting to be held in Madrid, 10 Sep tember 1975. In the meantime, the report has been approved by Dr Received: May 13, 1975. of replication or the lipid composition of the envelope. All in all. the time is now ripe for completing these basic studies of IBV and checking whether the same characteristics are found in the other viruses at present included in the group. It may take years to reach certainty on these points, but we believe this early attempt at taxonomy can be valuable in indicating which facts should be sought first, in order to clarify as soon as possible our understanding of this interesting and superficially diverse group.",

Multiply in cytoplasm, mature by budding through endoplasmic reticulum. No defined subgroups, but a tentative grouping may be made on basis of serology. IBV, many recognized serotypes, however, all seem to be interrelated, possibly by a common antigen. No interrelationship demonstrated with any of the other coronaviruses. HCV, several serotypes, two main groups -those isolated in tissue culture and those isolated in organ culture. Serologically related to MHV. The three rodent coronaviruses, MHV, RCV and SDAV, are interrelated serologi cally, and also related to HCV. No adequate information on rela tionship or diversity between individual strains of MHV. TGEV, no antigenic diversity between strains, possible relationship to HEV. HEV, no antigenic diversity between strains, possible relationship to TGEV. TBDV, only one report available, no relationship shown to other coronaviruses.10.2 Only one Genus, Coronavirus.
