Such an NRPS system would contain four distinctive modules. Each module would be responsible for the selection, activation, epimerization (when necessary), and incorporation of a precursor (also called building block: d\u2010Hiv, l\u2010Val, l\u2010Lac, or l\u2010Val) in a linear fashion, to form a tetradepsipeptide basic unit covalently tethered as an ester to the active\u2010site serine of the C\u2010terminal iterative TE domain. Two additional rounds of basic unit buildup would generate a linear 12\u2010building block intermediate stalled on the TE. Subsequently, TE would cleave off the intermediate and catalyze the head\u2010to\u2010tail cyclization to afford the mature VLM product (Scheme 2). Alternatively, a terminal peptidyl carrier protein\u2013condensation (PCP\u2013C) didomain might be substituted for the TE for basic unit buildup and cyclization\u2014a mechanism seen in the biosynthesis of enniatins.39 Considering that a typical NRPS module is encoded by an average 4.5 kb DNA, the putative VLM NRPS assembly line would be expected to require approximately 18 kb of DNA. Genes involved in regulation and self\u2010resistance would also be anticipated in the putative vlm gene cluster.40 With the prediction of a large vlm gene cluster, the \u201cgenome\u2010scanning\u201d approach41 was adopted to clone the cluster.

Module 1 is the initiation module that contains four functional domains, adenylation (A; designated as VLM1A1), hypothetical transaminase (TA), hypothetical dehydrogenase (DH2), and PCP. The presence of these two hypothetical domains in module 1 correlates well with a proposed mechanism for the generation of the biosynthetic precursor d\u2010Hiv (Scheme 3). According to a study of enniatin biosynthesis in Fusarium sambucinum, d\u2010Hiv was postulated to be derived from l\u2010Val by sequential transamination (catalyzed by an uncharacterized TA) and dehydrogenation (catalyzed by a purified discrete d\u2010Hiv DH2).44 Generation of precursor d\u2010Hiv in VLM biosynthesis might follow the same route, catalyzed by discrete TA and DH2 enzymes yet to be discovered, or by the integral hypothetical TA and DH2 domains in this module. Module 2 contains four standard NRPS domains: C, A (designated as VLM1A2), PCP, and epimerase (E). Module 3 contains four domains: C, A (designated as VLM2A3), hypothetical DH2, and PCP. This hypothetical DH2 domain is speculated to act as a l\u2010lactate dehydrogenase to convert pyruvate into l\u2010Lac which is then acylated onto PCP (Scheme 3).44 Generation of lactate from pyruvate is a common biochemical reaction in many microorganisms that undergo fermentation. However, dedicated l\u2010Lac DH2 has not been characterized from any known natural product biosynthetic pathway. Module 3 is split into two proteins, a phenomenon increasingly found in natural product biosynthetic pathways.45 Module 4 contains a minimal set of three NRPS domains: C, A (designated as VLM2A4), and PCP.",

At substrate specificity level, VLM1A2 and VLM2A4 contain conserved NRPS codes49, 50 (DALWLGGTFK and DAFWVGGTFK, respectively) that are predicted to specify for l\u2010Val. In contrast, extracted NRPS codes from VLM1A1 or VLM2A3 (AALWIADSGK or VVIWIAEQHK, respectively) do not yield any predictable substrate. Remarkably, both VLM1A1 and VLM2A3 have the highly conserved Asp at position 235 (first position in the NRPS codes; numbered by GrsA_A sequence) replaced by an Ala or Val. Similarly, DhbE also has the conserved Asp residue replaced by an Asn. This finding suggests that VLM1A1 and VLM2A3, together with DhbE, might represent a divergent group of A domains that specify for a class of hydroxyl acid substrates other than proteinogenic amino acids or carboxyl acids. In the proposed model for VLM biosynthesis (Scheme 2) module 1 and 3 are responsible for the incorporation of d\u2010Hiv and l\u2010Lac, respectively.

Terminal TE domains are known to control the termination, release, and cyclization of growing chains in the biosynthetic process of many nonribosomal peptides and polyketides.51, 52 An unsolved mystery regarding the biosynthesis of symmetric cyclo(depsi)peptides is the control of repetition of the basic units. As shown in Scheme 1, VLM contains a three\u2010repeating sequence of a tetradepsipeptide basic unit (designated as a 3\u00d74 mode), whereas montanastatin (C36H60N4O12, M\nW=740.9)18 contains the exact same tetradepsipeptide basic unit that repeats only twice (a 2\u00d74 mode). This observation raises the question of whether VLM and montanastatin are produced by the same biosynthetic pathway with relaxed control of basic unit repetition, or by two independent pathways, each of which has a stringent control of basic\u2010unit repetition. A low level of montanastatin was detected by LC\u2010MS in the wild\u2010type strain of S. tsusimaensis but not in the St\u2010nrps\n\u2212 mutants. This result suggests that montanastatin is likely the shunt product of VLM, produced by the same VLM biosynthetic pathway with a relaxed TE control of basic unit repetition. In comparison to VLM and montanastatin, enniatin A has a 3\u00d72 mode, whereas cereulide and PF1022A have a 3\u00d74 and 2\u00d74 mode, respectively. Not included in Scheme 1 are additional known symmetric nonribosomal peptide natural products\u2014bacillibactin, enterobactin, and gramicidin S[39]\u2014which have a 3\u00d72, 3\u00d72, or 2\u00d75 mode, respectively. Iterative TE domains in the pathways for the biosynthesis of these symmetric oligomeric products are believed to hold the basic unit until an appropriate number of units are condensed and then proceed with cleavage and cyclization.51 However, the exact mechanism of controlling the number of repetitions remains unknown. An amino acid sequence alignment (data not shown) of VLM2_TE with DEBS3_TE (accession no. Q03133), SrfA\u2010C_TE (accession no. Q08787), Bs\u2010EntF_TE (accession no.

This vlm gene cluster contains two biosynthetic genes encoding type B iterative NRPSs. These NRPSs contribute an assembly line that consists of sixteen distinctive domains organized into four modules; each module is expected to incorporate a biosynthetic precursor to form a tetradepsipeptide basic unit. A terminal TE domain might mediate the oligomerization and cyclization of three\u2010repeating sequence of the basic unit to afford the mature VLM product (Scheme 2). The cloning and decoding of VLM biosynthetic machinery offers an opportunity for genetic manipulation of the pathway. Genetic engineering of the VLM biosynthesis pathway serves to complement chemical synthesis to generate novel VLM analogues for screening potent, highly specific, and low cytotoxic anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV agents and/or other anti\u2010infective therapeutics.",
