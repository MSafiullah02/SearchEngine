            "text": "Bats use caves for hibernation, reproduction, rearing of young and other social events (Kunz, 1982). In Europe, caves are used regularly or occasionally by 46 bat species (Fauna Europaea, 2004). One of the most important factors determining the presence of bats in caves is microclimate, both during hibernation (Gaisler, 1970; Harmata, 1973; Kunz, 1982; Speakman & Thomas, 2003) and during reproduction (Racey, Speakman & Swift 1987; Plachter & Plachter, 1988). Bat species differ in their thermopreferenda and therefore choose different shelters (Nagel & Nagel, 1991). The microclimate is dependent on the length of the cave, the number of entrances and depth (denivelation \u2013 distance between the highest and the deepest place in the cave) as well as the average temperature (Kowalski, 1954), which in turn is related to latitude, longitude and altitude. The number of bat species using a cave is correlated with its length (Arita, 1996), density of underground sites in each area (Brunet & Medellin, 2001) and environmental factors, such as geographical location and temperature range (\u0158eh\u00e1k, 2006; Ulrich, Sachanowicz & Michalak 2007).",

            "text": "Romania has a varied landscape with many uplands and mountains, including half the Carpathian range. These contain over 12 000 karst caves (Bleahu et al., 1976). The distribution of caves, their size (length and height), altitude, presence/absence of water and microclimate differ widely between the surveyed regions of Romania, and as a consequence, the bat fauna is varied (Dumitrescu, Tanasachi & Orghidan 1963). Most described caves are in the Apuseni Mountains, the Southern Carpathians and the Banat Mountains. In the Dobrogea Plateau, natural caves are small and have dynamic microclimates. In the Eastern Carpathians, although karstic caves are rare, sandstone caves, as well as mine tunnels, are found (Bleahu et al., 1976). Many of the caves are used by bats during both winter and summer, and some constitute the largest hibernacula in Central Europe for such species as Pipistrellus pipistrellus (Nagy & Szanto, 2003) and Miniopterus schreibersii (Benda et al., 2003). The years 1960\u20131970 in Central Europe were marked by a rapid decline of numerous bat species, especially Rhinolophus hipposideros, Myotis emarginatus and Myotis myotis (Stebbings, 1988). During the 40 years since Dumitrescu's et al.(1963) study, our knowledge of the distribution and status of cave\u2010dwelling bats has progressed little.",

To understand the distribution patterns of the species, we tested the hypothesis that bat species are randomly distributed in space and time, and their presence and density is independent of environmental factors. To test the significance of geographic and microclimate factors, we analysed cave parameters, together with bat distribution data in five distinct geographical units (Apuseni Mountains, Banat Mountains, Dobrogea Plateau, Eastern Carpathians and Southern Carpathians). The aim was to establish what environmental factors predict the presence or absence of species, and where in Romania these factors offer the most suitable conditions for a large number of species and individuals. Based on these analyses, we identified candidate special protected areas in different regions.",

The Carpathians is a major mountain system in Central and Eastern Europe, curving for 1500 km along the north and east sides of the Danube Plain. The geologically young mountains are divided in Romania into the Eastern Carpathians, the Southern Carpathians and the Banat and Apuseni Mountains. The mountains are characterized by a varied landscape, limestone areas rich in caves and a temperate continental climate. Karst areas are most evident in the Apuseni Mountains with 1047 km2, followed by Dobrogea (953 km2) and the Banat Mountains (807 km2), while the Southern and Eastern Carpathians have <800 km2. The average number of caves per km2 is the highest in the Apuseni Mountains (0.788), <0.5 in other regions and the lowest in Dobrogea (0.062) (Bleahu et al., 1976). The study areas reach the highest altitude in the Southern Carpathians (up to 2500 m a.s.l.), Eastern Carpathians (up to 2300 m a.s.l.), followed by Apuseni Mountains (1800 m a.s.l.) as well as Banat Mountains (1400 m a.s.l.), and the altitude of the Dobrogea Plateau varies between 200 and 400 m a.s.l. The mean annual temperature in most of the study area is between 2 and 6 \u00b0C, although it is 6\u20138 \u00b0C in the Banat Mountains and 10\u201311 \u00b0C in the Dobrogea Plateau (Bulla & Mendol, 1999).",

The geographical position of the cave (latitude, longitude, altitude) was measured using an eTrex Garmin GPS. Cave parameters (length and denivelation) were taken from the Romanian caves register (Goran, 1981). The presence of water in the caves was noted. We visited 79 caves in five regions of Romania (Fig. 1) a total of 236 times for mapping and survey. In the Apuseni Mountains, 36 caves were surveyed from 230 to 850 m a.s.l. (mean: 430 m a.s.l.) and varying in length from 19 to 4750 m (median: 350 m). In the Eastern Carpathians, 11 caves and one mine were visited, from 590 to 1503 m a.s.l. (mean: 778 m a.s.l.), and from 11 to 1527 m long (M=125 m). In the Southern Carpathians, 15 caves were visited, from 287 to 1150 m a.s.l. (mean: 632 m a.s.l.), and from 50 to 10 000 m long (M=725 m). In the Banat Mountains, 10 caves were visited, from 60 to 606 m a.s.l. (mean: 250 m a.s.l.), and from 94 to 1666 m (M=254 m) long. In the Dobrogea Plateau, five caves and 1 mine were visited, from 12 to 107 m a.s.l. (mean: 44 m a.s.l.) and from 42 to 3200 m long (M=132 m). Using a digital thermometer [Checktemp 1, Hanna Instruments (Cluj\u2013Napoca, Romania) with an accuracy \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C], we measured cave temperatures near the largest aggregation of bats in both summer and winter.

Species with less than 100 individuals (<0.17%) in all caves (during hibernation) or specimens not belonging to maternity colonies were excluded from ordination analysis. Before analysis, log\u2010transformation of data [ln (x+1)] was performed to reduce the influence of extreme values of bat numbers, during both the hibernation and maternity periods. To investigate how the hibernating bat communities changed between regions, we used canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) (ter Braak, 1995; ter Braak & \u0160milauer, 2002). Factors influencing hibernating bats were analysed using two sets of exploratory variables reflecting cave characteristics and geographical locations. Caves were described by four variables: length, temperature, elevation (at the entrance) and presence/absence of water (regular underground stream or lake); geographical location was described by five regions (Apuseni Mountains, Eastern Carpathians, Southern Carpathians, Banat Mountains and Dobrogea Plateau). For maternity colonies, the main gradients of variation were described from principal components analysis (PCA) because environmental data (parameters of caves and regions) were uncorrelated in the CCA analysis (ter Braak, 1995; ter Braak & \u0160milauer, 2002). Statistical analyses were performed using canoco 4.52 (ter Braak & \u0160milauer, 2002) and KyPlot 2 beta 13. Evaluation of the relative importance of the sites was based on the method of Mitchell\u2010Jones et al. (2000). Each site was assigned a combined total by adding scores for the species observed in the caves. Vulnerable species were given four points and species considered at a lower risk or near threatened were given two points. Four priority levels were used to grade the site. Priority level 1 refers to the most important underground roosts, which support the largest populations of most bat species and have the scores of 10 000 or more; level 2 refers to important underground sites, in which there are large populations and many bat species (1000 <score <10 000); level 3 includes sites of lower priority used by few species in small number (100<score<1000); while level 4 are sites used by few bats (score<100).",

The maximum number of bat species was found in the caves in the Apuseni Mountains (20 species), the Southern Carpathians (16 species) and the Banat Mountains (13 species), and in the caves in the Eastern Carpathians (11 species) and the Dobrogei Plateau (nine species). Almost half (48%) of the underground sites where bats hibernated are situated at the middle altitudes between 300 and 600 m a.s.l. Nearly 29% are located from the sea level to 300 m a.s.l., between 600 and 1200 m a.s.l. 22%, and about 1% over 1200 m a.s.l. Aggregations of <500 bats occurred in 83.3% of caves, from 500 to 5000 individuals in 13.6%, more than 10 000 individuals (10 000\u201360 000) in 3.0%. The largest aggregations comprised five bat species, that is Mi. schreibersii\u2013 up to 33 000 individuals, P. pipistrellus s.l. \u2013 up to 34 000 individuals, My. myotis/oxygnathus\u2013 up to 5100 individuals, R. ferrumequinum\u2013 up to 1600 individuals and N. noctula\u2013 up to 1000 individuals. Aggregations of other species consisted of about 200 individuals. The largest aggregations of bats were situated in caves in the Apuseni Mountains and the Southern Carpathians. CCA had eigenvalues for the first four axes of 0.275, 0.223, 0.107 and 0.066, respectively. Together, these explained 42.1% of the species variance and 89.8% of the species\u2010environmental variance. Monte\u2013Carlo tests showed that the overall CCA was significant (P=0.002). The tri\u2010plot of the first two axes (Fig. 3) showed a relatively good separation of the different roost parameters, geographical regions and bat species. Axis 1 (17.2%) displays the gradient of temperature: from the lower elevations and warmer caves of the Banat Mountains (r=\u22120.662) to higher altitudes (r=0.640) and colder caves of the Eastern Carpathians (r=0.440). My. capaccinii and R. euryale formed numerous aggregations in the caves of the Banat Mountains. My. myotis/oxygnathus comprised the largest aggregation in the Apuseni Mountains and the Eastern Carpathians, and they were less numerous but frequent in the Southern Carpathians. Axis 2 (14.0%) displays the gradient from caves with high temperature (r=0.466) to long caves (r=\u22120.533) and those with water (r=\u22120.352). P. pipistrellus s.l., N. noctula and B. barbastellus prefer cold caves. P. pipistrellus and N. noctula comprise aggregations in huge caves, frequently with water. P. pipistrellus s.l. comprise one of the largest winter aggregations in Romanian caves (>55 000 individuals). Mi. schreibersii is frequent and numerous in the caves of the Apuseni Mountains, where they comprise the second largest winter aggregation (>33 000 individuals). They also occurred frequently, but were less numerous in the Banat Mountains caves. Other species like R. ferrumequinum and R. hipposideros showed similar distribution patterns.",

The former species were found close to large water reservoirs, and in Romania, they reach the northern border of their distribution (Spitzenberger & von Helversen, 2001). We identified two important sites in the Danube Valley (Southern Carpathians and Banat Mountains.), both hosting nursery colonies, and another population in Dobrogea. Similar discontinuity is reported in neighbouring southern countries, such as Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece (2003, 2004, 2001). In winter, only small aggregations of fewer than 10 individuals were found, close to water sources and at a lower altitude in the Danube Valley. Bats probably migrate south and form huge aggregations in Bulgarian caves during wintering (T. Ivanova, pers. comm.). A single large hibernation aggregation of R. euryale in Romania was noticed in Lui Adam Cave with a particularly high temperature during the winter of over 18.0 \u00b0C. Thermal conditions of this cave are created by hot springs at 45\u201355 \u00b0C (Decou, Negrea & Negrea 1974). It seems that the presence of karst is more important for the occurrence of a species. In the entire Balkans, R. euryale is one of the most frequently recorded bats in karstic areas (1998, 2001, 1992). R. mehelyi also uses warm caves with little temperature fluctuation (Paksuz et al., 2007). However, the presence of these species is restricted to the Black Sea coast area, with only one known nursery colony, and no known hibernacula. The eastern part of the Danubian Lowland in Bulgaria and the karstic region of Romanian Dobrogea represent the northern margin of the known distribution of these species in the Balkans (Benda et al., 2003).",

My. myotis/oxygnathus are the most common species in such roosts in both seasons. These species overlap in most of our target areas, show similar characteristics of distribution, except Eastern Carpathians, from where Mi. schreibersii is missed. The altitudinal distribution shows similar patterns in winter and in summer for My. myotis/oxygnathus (2003, 1993), and for Mi. schreibersii (Benda et al., 2003). Likewise, also, the temperature within hibernacula for My. myotis (Harmata, 1973) and for Mi. schreibersii (Alcalde & Escala, 2000) is similar. Hibernacula of Mi. schreibersii rarely contain more than a few hundred bats, with one exception: Huda lui Papara cave, which contains large aggregations of up to 33 000 individuals. During the breeding season, both species choose caves with similar microclimates (2007, 2003), often forming mixed colonies.",

They have similar distribution patterns, but R. hipposideros is less abundant. Hibernaculum temperature is higher for R. hipposideros (Harmata, 1973; Gaisler, 2001) than for R. ferrumequinum (Pandurska, 1993). Both species are widespread, found frequently in caves during the winter months. R. ferrumequinum, one of the most common bat species from Romania, forms the largest known hibernation aggregation of up to 1600 specimens in the Southern Carpathians. Hibernating individuals in the Western part of Romania came from attic\u2010dwelling colonies located in the Tisa River lowlands, Hungary (Dobrosi & Guly\u00e1s, 1997).",

            "text": "Underground shelters selected by the bats are patchily distributed in different geographical regions. The south\u2010western karstic regions in Romania have the highest number of bat species (including vulnerable ones) and individuals. Throughout this range, a number of protected areas, national parks and Natura 2000 sites were established. Caves with touristic or scientific value in Romania are often administrated by non\u2010governmental organizations under contract with the Ministry of the Environment. In a few cases, some of these caves are important refuges for bat species. Collaboration between custodians, bat protection societies and environmental protection institutions is crucial at the local and regional level. Often, even when the custodians had approved management plans for caves, they had no financial resources for adequate site protection. Management plans for these areas should include the requirements of bats roosting in caves. These needs should reflect the individual species conservation ecology and the status of the surrounding feeding habitats. Special attention should be paid to those caves that house a very large number of specimens (like Mi. schreibersii) or are the last known refuge for vulnerable species occurring in small numbers (such as R. mehelyi), which are highly sensitive to human disturbance. Similar treatments should be applied to those caves that house Mediterranean species in a small number on the edge of their distribution (R. euryale, My. cappacinii). As a result of direct human pressure, there is a possibility of the disappearance of these species in the mid\u2010 term, as was shown by the drastic decline in recent decades of R. mehelyi in Romania. This vulnerable bat formed colonies with 500 individuals in Dobrogea in the middle of the 1970s (\u010cerveny, 1982), and has shown a rapid decline in recent decades (Grimmberger, 1993; this paper). Comparing the distributional data for Mi. schreibersii, it is apparent that from 14 colonies or aggregations described in the 1960s (Dumitrescu et al., 1963), 11 have now disappeared from all regions. Large Myotis species and rhinolophids show similar trends. The largest winter aggregation described in Romania for My. myotis/oxygnathus was recorded in Rarau cave (Eastern Carpathians), with 8000 individuals (Valenciuc, 1982), reduced nowadays to 2000 bats.",

These regions have the largest number of caves mid\u2010 to low attitude, some of which are also warm, and in which the highest numbers of species were recorded. Specific requirements of the identified groups are a focus in these places. Our results confirm the conclusions of Brunet and Medellin (2001) that a high density of caves in one area offers suitable living conditions for large populations of different species, forming hotspots at a regional level. These areas function as core areas for a few species. In contrast, the Dobrogea region will remain only at the margins of the distribution range of a few species because cave density is low and the number of bats found there has declined over recent decades.",
