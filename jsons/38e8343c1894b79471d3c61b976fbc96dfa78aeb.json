Current human deaths due to the infection have raised the threat globally with only 1 African country free of Virus (Lesotho) as of May 6th, 2020. Different countries have adopted different interventions at different stages of the outbreak, with social distancing being the first option while lock down the preferred option for flattening the curve at the peak of the pandemic. Lock down is aimed at adherence to social distancing, preserve the health system and improve survival. We propose a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Expected recoveries (SEIR) mathematical model to study the impact of a variety of prevention and control strategies Uganda has applied since the eruption of the pandemic in the country. We analyze the model using available data to find the infection-free, endemic/infection steady states and the basic reproduction number. In addition, a sensitivity analysis done shows that the transmission rate and the rate at which persons acquire the virus, have a positive influence on the basic reproduction number. On other hand the rate of evacuation by rescue ambulance greatly reduces the reproduction number. The results have potential to inform the impact and effect of early strict interventions including lock down in resource limited settings and social distancing.",

The disease has not respected borders, 4 socio-economic developments of countries or states, and personal status. COVID-19 5 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has 6 spread worldwide [1] . Even in countries and states with very high levels of emergency 7 response preparedness, COVID-19 has had early and projected ramifications in all areas 8 of life including health, economy, education, travel, development and security. Globally, 9 the number of cases confirmed to the disease has surpassed 3.5 million people with over 10 248,313 deaths (CFR: 7% ) and 1,157,014 recoveries [5] . The evolution of the current 11 pandemic has dis-proportionally affected various countries. The top most affected 12 countries both in confirmed cases and mortality burden include: USA, Spain, Italy, 13 France, UK and Germany. With USA showing the highest death toll 68,602 persons 14 (with 5.8% Case fatality rate), as of May 4th, 2020 [5] . In Africa, an estimated 44,483 15 confirmed cases; 1,801 death, with case fatality rate of 4% and 14,921 recoveries have 16 occurred, as of May 4th, 2020 [23] . Countries that have not reported COVID-19 cases 17 as of, May 4th, 2020 include: Kiribati, Lesotho, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, 18 North Korea, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, 19 Vanuatu [25] . The pandemic however, has both direct and indirect effects and 20 ramifications in all sectors of life including health, economy, trade, travel, education and 21 governance. 22 In Uganda, the index case was confirmed on March 21, 2020 [4] . Despite immediate 23 lock down and intense public health interventions including contact tracing, the country 24 has registered eighty-nine (89) cases as of May 4th, 2020 [5] . Majority of these cases are 25 imported cases including recent truck drivers from the East African region. The total 26 number of foreign truck drivers who have tested positive for COVID-19 is thirty (30), of 27 these nineteen have returned to their respective countries whereas eleven are admitted 28 at different hospitals in Uganda [6] . The community transmission through contacts has 29 emerged and the extent of which remains unknown since many of those who traveled updates as of May 4th, 2020 indicate that a total of thirty nine thousand, two hundred 36 thirty two (39,232) persons have been tested, of whom eighty nine (89) are confirmed 37 cases, eight hundred sixty one (861) have been discharged from institutional quarantine, 38 four hundred forty six (446) are under institutional quarantine, one thousand three 39 hundred two (1,302) are contacts listed, eight hundred eight (808) are under follow up, 40 141 are under self quarantine, eighteen (18) are active cases and fifty two (52) have fully 41 recovered following successful treatment [3, 6] . The distribution of COVID-19 confirmed 42 cases by residence is shown in [6] .",

The 252 sudden decrease in the number of infected persons is a resilient confirmation for the 253 effectiveness of the available facilities in the health care systems. Whereas an increase of 254 the number of expected recoveries is evidence of enough facilities available. The disease 255 slows down and health institutions cope with the sick by giving them attention. The 256 government has the potential to eradicate the disease in fourteen months (1 yr and 2 257 months). 258 From our model system (1) Fig 6 (a) that is generated, we project the infected 259 population to reach a peak time in one month and 22 days with an estimated 177 Fig. 6.

The government of Uganda has done her best to prevent and control 261 the disease to see that no death has been confirmed as per May 7, 2020. However, 262 Fig 6(b) shows the likelihood of COVID-19 disease re-emerging in the population after 263 430 days \u2248 one (1) year and (10) ten days. 264 Fig 7 (a) shows the effect of varying the rate \u03b6 at which awareness programs are 265 implemented on the unaware population. An increase from \u03b6 = 0.345 to \u03b6 = 3.45 leads 266 to a reduction in the number of the unaware persons. This means that the population is 267 able to avoid the transmission of the disease. A decrease from \u03b6 = 0.345 to 3.45 leaves a 268 proportion of individuals unaware which means the authorities would need more 269 resources to disseminate the information. Moreover, Fig 7 (b) explains the effect of 270 varying of media M that disseminate information about COVID-19. We observe that 271 reducing M from 4 to 2 leaves a high number of the population unaware of the existing 272 measures. Whereas increasing M from 4 to 6 reduces the number of unaware 273 sub-population implying people can be able to change the way they socialize; thus 274 reducing the transmission of the disease. From Fig 7, it would take policy makers 400 275 days (\u2248 1 yr and 10 days) from the inception of the disease to implement the awareness 276 program and cover the entire population and realize stability.
