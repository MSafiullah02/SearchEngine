            "text": "Swine in pig fattening are ubiquitously prone to different kinds of pathogens that can be fatal or even beneficial when combined. Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) with a high sequence homology to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is considered to protect swine from the fatal intestinal infection due to cross-protection between these two coronaviruses (Bernard et al., 1989). PRCoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae within the genus \u03b1-Coronavirus (Thiel, 2007). These single stranded RNA viruses of positive genome orientation use their spike protein for receptor binding (Delmas et al., 1992, Siddell et al., 1983). Like TGEV, PRCoV uses aminopeptidase N for virus entry but replicates solely in the respiratory tract of swine (Rasschaert et al., 1990, Rasschaert et al., 1987). Infection by PRCoV causes mild clinical symptoms in swine like sneezing, coughing, mild fever, polypnea and anorexia (Bourgueil et al., 1992, Cox et al., 1990, Jung et al., 2007). However, this coronavirus can be part of the porcine respiratory disease complex, like the swine influenza A viruses (SIV) subtype H3N2 or H1N1. Influenza A viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and are viruses with single stranded RNA of negative polarity (Kuntz-Simon and Madec, 2009). They co-evolved in Europe and are typed by their glycoproteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) (Marozin et al., 2002). Genetic drift and reassortment of the influenza subtypes cause different disease outcome in the same host, e.g. H3N2 is a reassorted SIV from the avian originated H1N1 and another H3N2 (Castrucci et al., 1993, Guan et al., 1996, Marozin et al., 2002, Meng et al., 2013). The hemagglutinin binds to the sialic acids at the cell surface for virus entry (Doms et al., 1986, Gambaryan et al., 2005). Swine influenza A viruses cause the typical swine flu with symptoms varying from fever and depression or coughing (barking) and discharge from the nose or eyes, as well as sneezing and breathing difficulties (Meng et al., 2013). The targets of these SIV subtypes are the cells of the respiratory epithelium (Punyadarsaniya et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Generally, PRCoV infection is common in pig fattening, but only limited information is available on the effect of co-infection with other viruses and their effect on disease outcome in the host (Jung et al., 2009). Studies on swine infected with PRCoV and SIV H1N1 showed clinical disease signs to be more severe in those swine infected with both viruses, but no difference in antibody responses against SIV H1N1 were measured (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994). Earlier studies on co-infection of swine infected intranasally and by aerosol with PRCoV and SIV H3N2 or H1N1 did not enhance the pathogenicity of these viruses (Lanza et al., 1992). Nasal swabs and tissue analysis showed isolated virus rather in mono- than co-infected swine, suggesting in vivo interference in the replication of PRCoV and SIV (Lanza et al., 1992). To further study this phenomenon other tools for analysis are necessary to get insight into the processes of viral infection in the respiratory tract. Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) are a useful tool to analyze viral infiltration ex vivo. Lung slices have been used in scientific studies from a variety of animals like rodents, caprine or bovine lung or even human lung (Abdull Razis et al., 2011, Banerjee et al., 2012, Braun and Tschernig, 2006, Goris et al., 2009, Kirchhoff et al., 2014a, Kirchhoff et al., 2014b). However, although porcine PCLS have been analyzed in the context of influenza A virus infection and co-infection with bacteria, the co-infection with coronaviruses remains to be investigated (Meng et al., 2013, Punyadarsaniya et al., 2011, Wu et al., 2016). Porcine lung slices are easy to produce and reproduce under stable conditions, while mimicking respiratory infection. In the present study infection of PCLS by PRCoV was analyzed and compared with infection by SIV H3N2 and H1N1. Finally, the influence of co-infection with both virus species on viral replication efficiency in the PCLS system was investigated. Possible differences or interferences in co- infections as result of innate immune responses are discussed.",

All virus strains were diluted in RPMI to a titer of 5.5 \u00d7 105\n TCID50/mL. In total, 200 \u03bcL of virus dilution was added to one PCLS per well. For mono-infection diluted virus was incubated with PCLS for 1 h. Different co-infection models were tested, starting with influenza virus incubation for 1 h followed by PRCoV incubation or vice versa. Additionally simultaneous infection of PCLS with the different influenza A virus subtypes and PRCoV for 1 h were performed. For control PCLS, 200 \u03bcL of medium was added for 1 h. In total 10 different mono- and co-infection groups were used per experiment (Fig. 1\n). On NPTr cells the same virus infection groups were used to analyze differences in mono- and co-infection in cell culture. Cells were seeded on cover slips in a 24 well plate and incubated by a multiplicity of infection of 1 for 1 h. After 72 h of infection cells were analyzed by antibody staining and supernatant was collected for titration of infectious virus.",

Random differences were measured between the co-infection groups. Co- infection of PRCoV + SIV H3N2 vs. 1.SIV H3N2 + 2.PRCoV showed significant lower titer (p = 0.0112). Similar results were measured for the same co-infection combination of SIV H1N1 instead of SIV H3N2 (p = 0.001). All titers measured for co-infection groups never exceeded mono-infection titers.",

This was seen in control slices that dropped in ciliary activity after > 4 days, similar to earlier studies (Meng et al., 2013, Punyadarsaniya et al., 2011). This may be caused by the fact that the medium was not changed. However, there were obvious differences from uninfected to infected PCLS at similar time points. SIV H3N2 ciliary activity showed a concrete reduction, comparable to another study done with the same SIV strain (Punyadarsaniya et al., 2011). SIV H1N1 however, revealed a more reduced ciliary activity than shown before by the same strain (Meng et al., 2013). This effect may be explained by a slightly higher titer used in this study for infection of the slices. Single infection by PRCoV had the lowest effect on ciliary activity over time compared to all other mono- and co-infections. No differences between the SIV strains and their co-infections were visible concerning PCLS ciliary activity.",

Comparing co-infection of simultaneously given viruses to mono-infection showed no increase in respiratory symptoms or lung lesions (Lanza et al., 1992). Mean duration of excreted influenza virus was shorter in dual than in single-infected pigs (Lanza et al., 1992). Interestingly, in tissues of mono-infected swine with PRCoV, the virus was isolated for a longer period of time than by co-infections with SIV H3N2/H1N1 (Lanza et al., 1992). This proves some interesting overlap to our results showing lower virus titers in co-infected PCLS compared to the mono-infection with PRCoV. Simultaneously, no enhanced or even lower pathogenicity was detected by co-infection of the swine compared to mono-infection (Lanza et al., 1992).",

This indicates that the viruses target roughly the same cell types, even though dissimilar cell receptors are used for cell entry. It seems that after entry of one virus species the cell becomes refractory for infection with the remaining other virus species resulting in lower infection rates. One explanation for this negative mutual interference might be the blockage or steric hindrance of cellular receptors by the first interacting virus. Furthermore, innate immune responses influence virus replication and may lead to a reduction in virus titers after co-infection with both virus species. Induction of intracellular signaling cascades by RNA viruses results in the activation of transcription factors, which regulate the expression of abundant other genes, such as interferons (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Katze et al., 2008).",

Mx proteins are dynamin-like large GTPases that are highly induced by IFN \u03b1 and \u03b2, but are not constitutively present in normal cells (Haller and Kochs, 2002, Zimmermann et al., 2011). Infection of PCLS with SIVs may cause Mx protein activation. Therefore, the PCLS system might be used to analyze the role of Mx proteins in porcine respiratory infection. Influenza strains differ in their sensitiveness to antiviral effects of Mx proteins (Zimmermann et al., 2011). This does have an impact on virus replication and pathogenic outcome and could also be a reason why on the one hand co-infections are not as successfully in viral replication than mono-infection of PCLS, but on the other hand why different SIVs also cause different amounts in virus titers.",
