These drugs can be used as first-line or second-line treatment, as well as for prevention purposes. Observed HSRs may be mild, moderate, but may also be life-threatening by severely affecting vital parameters. All organ systems can be affected during reactions, so clinical symptoms are quite diverse. Reactions may occur due to allergic, non-allergic, or immunological side effects. The risk of allergic reactions decreases proportionally with the increase in human homology of the BS (Fig. 1; [163]). Vultaggio and co-authors explain the reactions to BSs with two possible main mechanisms: (i) loss of immune tolerance due to side effect of the BSs; and (ii) triggering of immune responses and reactions to non-self epitopes in BSs [164].",
