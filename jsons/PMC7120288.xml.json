The incidence of depression has increased rapidly in Western countries, and the number of Japanese individuals diagnosed with this condition has also increased, from 100  000 (83.1 per 100  000) to 430  000 (340.0 per 100  000), between 1984 and 1998. These data may reflect increased use of a standardized method for diagnosing depression, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or they may relate to decreased resistance among those suffering from mind/body distress to visiting a psychiatrist. Although depression is generally more common in women than in men, the most dramatic increase in the rate of depression in Japan occurred among middle-aged men (40\u201360 years old); a similar trend was observed among those who committed suicide. An analysis of the relationship between six categories of occupational status and suicide revealed that suicide rates were the highest among the \u201cunemployed\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d groups. Therefore, it is important to target middle-aged employees and unemployed people to identify potentially depressed individuals in Japan.",

Medicine should not be limited to the treatment of disease; it is also important to prevent disease, whether at the tertiary or secondary level. The practice of medicine in a hospital requires a trusting relationship between patient and doctor, and both must be aware of the power of the mind\u2013body connection. Communication is a key factor in developing this relationship. Although medical practitioners are busy and often do not nurture trusting relationships, such relationships are nonetheless a key component of mind/body medicine. Effective communication helps promote patient satisfaction and makes a good physician better; however, a sound education, one that includes attendance at lectures and participation in simulations or hands-on training, is critical for the development of excellent physicians.",

            "text": "Case-method teaching is a practical approach to training in the field of social medicine [4]. This approach involves discussions about a particular case; participating doctors are taught how to deal with situations in which they must reach decisions about public health. The disease-oriented system (DOS) has formed the basis of traditional educational systems, adhering to traditional medical teaching methods. Although the DOS seems to be an effective and reasonable method for obtaining results; it is neither perfect nor optimal in terms of practicality. The problem-based learning (PBL) method was developed to overcome these limitations in the DOS method. Medical treatment is incomplete when the individual is considered in isolation. Indeed, we must consider various ambient and interactive environmental factors in order to adequately understand the etiology of, and recovery from, a disease. In other words, although we emphasize treating the patients and not the diseases, we do not provide our medical students with the practical training required to achieve this goal. Figure 1 visually represents the case-method concept, illustrating a more systematic and holistic approach to medicine, in which the scope of learning\u2013 which proceeds through discussion  \u2013  is wider than that of DOS or PBL. Through such quasi experience-based studies, medical students can not only acquire knowledge and develop the desired professional attitudes and behaviors but can also come to learn about the psychological and social problems actually experienced by patients. Thus, in a way that mimics medical practice, they will be trained to solve problems embedded in actual situations. In addition, the shift from passive to active learning should enhance other abilities, such as communication skills and the practice of continually updating knowledge about state-of-the-art medical technologies. The case-method approach also offers the advantage of using actual cases to learn about the multidimensional issues involved in various aspects of medical practice, such as drawing on knowledge as the basis of actions, understanding the backgrounds of patients, and maintaining awareness of personal motivations and ethical concerns. However, the case method also has its share of problems. Table 1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the case-method approach. We now discuss strategies for dealing with these disadvantages.\n\n",

Three levels of teaching objectives are relevant to students who are also professionals:\nLevel One is the transmission of knowledge through information, concepts, frameworks, tools, and techniquesLevel Two is the development of skills for analyzing, thinking critically, making judgments and decisions, and executing decisionsLevel Three is the development of a professional identity and leadership capabilities accompanied by a set of values, self-awareness, and a capacity for ongoing learning\n",

The coding approach is tailored to the specific dyadic exchanges that occur in medical encounters. Coding categories directly reflect the content and context of the routine dialogue between patients and physicians, including both task-focused and socio-emotional domains. Identification and classification of verbal events are coded directly from videotapes or audiotapes, not from transcripts. Coding software to help coders work directly from the audio/video data is also available. Elimination of the resource-intensive effort necessary for an accurate and full transcription represents a practical advantage offered by the RIAS. In addition, because coding proceeds directly from video or audiotapes, it is possible to assess the tonal qualities of the interaction. Furthermore, the validity and reliability of the RIAS have been assessed in previous studies, and both have been rated favorably in a comparison study. The list of RIAS-related studies is available from the RIAS website (http://riasworks.com).",

These communication styles have often been recommended to physicians for use in patient-centered consultations. On the other hand, the perceived emotional responsiveness of physicians was negatively associated with patient satisfaction. In this study, most of the utterances classified as physician emotional responsiveness were statements intended to reassure and encourage patients, such as \u201cthere is no need to worry\u201d or \u201cyou will be all right.\u201d These data suggest that reassurance and encouragement might differ in essential ways from empathy and acceptance. That is, encouraging statements, especially when offered early in the presentation of patient complaints, may function as interruptions, preventing patients from fully describing their concerns.
