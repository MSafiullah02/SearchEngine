            "text": "As a specific component of corporate social responsibility, corporate charitable giving (CCG) is the act of corporations donating a portion of their profits or resources to social and charitable causes, including support for education, culture, the arts, minorities, health care, the environment and other public benefits (Godfrey, 2005, Wang et al., 2008). Why do corporations do this? According to value enhancement theory, CCG creates value for shareholders (Brown et al., 2006, Fry et al., 1982, Navarro, 1988). Brown et al. (2006) argued that CCG could be viewed as a form of investment to maximize shareholder value by enhancing employee morale, customer loyalty, and preferential treatment by regulators or policymakers. Researchers in finance, management and social science have attempted to identify the effects of CCG on corporate performance (Brammer and Millington, 2008, Lev et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2008). However, there is no consensus on the effects of CCG on corporate performance (Brammer and Millington, 2008, Wang et al., 2008).",

(2008) concluded that CCG facilitates stakeholder cooperation and helps secure access to critical resources controlled by those stakeholders, suggesting that CCG should be positively associated with corporate financial performance. In addition, according to the value enhancement theory, CCG can persuade target stakeholders that a firm is socially responsible. Brown et al. (2006) and Navarro (1988) indicated that a positive company image could create the competitive advantages of brand differentiation, stakeholder loyalty and insurance-like protection. These competitive advantages thereby improve operational efficiency, reduce cost and generate profit for shareholders. Consequently, CCG should have a positive impact on corporate performance.",

Based on agency cost theory, CCG may be considered as an additional agency cost generated by the conflict between shareholders and managerial insiders (managers and board directors) over charitable donation (Brown et al., 2006). When managerial insiders pursue their own interest through discretionary giving, they tend to give more to charity but at the expense of shareholders\u2019 interest (Barnett, 2007, Haley, 1991, Wang et al., 2008). Thus when the managerial insiders have an incentive to use CCG to enhance their own interests, CCG would not benefit the corporation and its shareholders. Instead, it may divert valuable corporate resources and undermine corporate performance.",

Several examinations of the effects of CCG on firm performance, on the one hand, have been conducted for developed countries, such as the UK (for example, Brammer and Millington, 2008) and USA (Seifert et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2008, Lev et al., 2010). No research studies have investigated whether corporate giving affects the corporate performance in an emerging country. Since economic, ethic, social, legal, political and culture factors differ between developed and emerging countries, corporate structure (such as firm characteristics, agency conflicts and business environment) in emerging countries would be different from those in developed countries (Wright et al., 2005, Young et al., 2008). As Brown et al. (2006), Navarro (1988) and Wang et al. (2008) noted, agency cost, value-enhancing and other firm-related factors are critical determinants of corporate giving. Given the potential differences in corporate structure across countries that may lead to the diverse giving determinants from country to country, corporate giving and its relative importance would vary across countries (Seifert et al., 2003). Accordingly, it would be interesting and worthwhile to see if corporate giving also affects corporate financial performance in an emerging country.",

For example, Chen et al. (2005) tested the impact of a set of macroeconomic variables on hotel stock returns in Taiwan. Chen et al. (2007) examined the effect of the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on Taiwanese hotel stock prices. Chen (2007) studied whether monetary policy changes could affect Taiwanese hotel stock returns. Chen et al. (2012) investigated the impact of insider managerial ownership on financial performance of publicly traded tourist hotels in Taiwan. Although previous hospitality studies have analyzed various financial issues and made different contributions to the research on the hospitality industry in Taiwan, this study can further enrich the hospitality financial literature by examining the impact of CCG on the Taiwanese hospitality firms\u2019 performance.",

Specifically, the total value of annual corporate giving of the Taiwanese hospitality industry was approximately NT$ (New Taiwan dollar) 2.70 million in 1996. The total value increased to 6.62 million in 2009, 11.42 million in 2010 and 11.62 million in 2011, an approximately 330.4% growth rate over that 16-year period. According to the Market Observation Post System (http://newmopsov.twse.com.tw/), the total value of CCG made by Taiwanese publicly traded companies was about NT$ 2.80 billion in 2011. This figure represents about 0.28% of all annual pre-taxable profits of all publicly traded companies in Taiwan. The total value of CCG from hospitality companies amounted to approximately NT$ 11.62 million in 2011. The hospitality industry, among 27 industry sectors listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 1996 to 2011, was ranked second in terms of the ratio of the total value of CCG to sales revenue, only behind the biotechnology industry (see Fig. 1\n).",

Do hospitality companies realize that CCG could have an adverse impact on corporate performance according to agency cost theory, or that CCG may not even affect corporate performance at all? Accordingly, the major contribution of this study is to analyze whether CCG affects the corporate performance of publicly traded hospitality companies, and if so, whether the relation between CCG and corporate performance is curvilinear and whether the impact is positive, negative or negligible.",

The indicators of corporate performance under consideration are profitability measures (return on assets and return on equity), stock performance and Tobin's Q. Return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) are two of the most popular profitability measures used in the business and finance literature. Stock price, reflecting the earnings prospects of a company, can be used to compute shareholders\u2019 return and evaluate financial performance of publicly traded hospitality companies. Tobin's Q is commonly used to measure the intangible asset values of companies.",

Value enhancement theory suggests that CCG acts as a specific business expense that can benefit firm performance (Navarro, 1988). Alternatively, agency cost theory advocates that CCG may be considered as an additional agency cost generated by the conflict between shareholders and the managerial insiders concerning charitable donation (Brown et al., 2006). The interaction of benefit and cost generated by CCG consequently determines the effects of CCG on corporate performance (Barnett, 2007, Brammer and Millington, 2008, Godfrey, 2005, Lev et al., 2010, Seifert et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2008).

(2010) contended that a socially responsible image can differentiate a brand and enhance customer loyalty, especially for consumer-focused firms. Bhattacharya and Sen (2003) suggested that CCG may induce customers to increase their demand for the firm's products or services, or their willingness to pay premium prices. Therefore, firms with high CCG differentiated themselves from those with lower CCG to the target consumer and reaped the benefits of consumer loyalty (Brammer and Millington, 2008). Examining the effect of corporate giving growth on sales growth using a large sample of publicly traded U.S. companies from 1989 through 2000, Lev et al. (2010) identified a positive link between CCG and customer satisfaction and found that CCG is significantly and positively related to future sales revenue.",

Brown et al.

Godfrey (2005) asserted that CCG benefited shareholders by generating positive moral capital among stakeholders and communities. The moral capital can then provide shareholders with protection for a firm's relationship-based intangible assets.

Although CCG contributions, a specific component of corporate social responsibility (CSR), are of growing importance to companies, the studies of CCG remain relatively underdeveloped (Brammer and Millington, 2008, Liket and Simaens, 2013).

For instance, if b\ni1 and b\ni2 are rejected, and specifically the coefficient of CGR on ROA is significantly positive (negative) and the coefficient of CGR\n2 on ROA is significantly negative (positive), it hence indicates that there is an inverted U-shaped (a U-shaped) relationship between CGR and ROA. However, if b\n11 (i\n = 1\u20264) are significantly different from zero (b\ni1\n = 0 is rejected) and b\ni2 is not significantly different from zero (b\ni2\n = 0 is not rejected), suggesting that the relationship between CGR and corporate performance (ROA, ROE, SR or TQ) is linear, not curvilinear.

For the two control variables, GSALE has an expected significant impact on corporate performance measures in terms of ROA, ROE and stock return. However, firm size is found to have a significantly negative influence on ROA, ROE and TQ in this study, which is different from the result in Wang et al. (2008) that SIZE has a significantly positive influence on ROA and TQ. This implies that larger hospitality firms in Taiwan are likely to have poor profitability performance and lower intangible asset value (or future growth opportunity). The finding contradicts the arguments by Ben-Zion and Shalit (1975) and Hardwick (1997) that larger firms should have a better performance. Why large hospitality firms in Taiwan have poor corporate performance in terms of ROA, ROE and TQ, and whether poor corporate performance affects CCG decisions of large Taiwanese hospitality firms are questions that merit further investigation.",
