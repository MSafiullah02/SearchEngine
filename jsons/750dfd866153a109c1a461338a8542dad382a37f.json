Reproductive isolation is expected to be particularly likely to evolve by this mechanism in species such as phytophagous insects that mate in the habitats in which they eat. We tested this expectation by monitoring the evolution of reproductive isolation in laboratory populations of an RNA virus that undergoes genetic exchange only when multiple virus genotypes coinfect the same host. We subjected four populations of the RNA bacteriophage 6 to 150 generations of natural selection on a novel host. Although there was no direct selection acting on host range in our experiment, three of the four populations lost the ability to infect one or more alternative hosts. In the most extreme case, one of the populations evolved a host range that does not contain any of the hosts infectible by the wild-type 6. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that the resulting reproductive isolation was due to a single nucleotide change, highlighting the ease with which an emerging RNA virus can decouple its evolutionary fate from that of its ancestor. Our results uniquely demonstrate the evolution of reproductive isolation in allopatric experimental populations. Furthermore, our data confirm the biological credibility of simple \"no-gene\" mechanisms of assortative mating, in which this trait arises as a pleiotropic effect of genes responsible for ecological adaptation.",

Yet scientists are still elucidating and debating the relative importance of different mechanisms for speciation (Coyne and Orr 2004) . In the traditional Dobzhansky-Muller model of speciation, genetic incompatibilities are thought to accumulate over time between allopatric, spatially separated populations, eventually resulting in postmating barriers to reproduction such as hybrid inviability and sterility (Dobzhansky 1937; Muller 1939 Muller , 1940 Muller , 1942 . Although natural selection can play a role in the evolution of genetic incompatibilities, in this model of speciation the role of natural selection in the evolution of reproductive isolation is not direct. That is, reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence, not of the phenotypes, but of the genotypes produced by natural selection (Templeton 1980; Doebeli et al. 2005) .",

In this scenario, natural selection could facilitate speciation in both sympatry and allopatry (Schluter 2001; Coyne and Orr 2004) . Of particular interest is the process of ecological speciation, in which assortative mating evolves as a pleiotropic consequence of divergent natural selection for ecologically important traits (Schluter 2001) . For instance, assortative mating should evolve as a pleiotropic consequence of selection for divergent habitat preference as long as organisms mate in their preferred habitat. In this simplest mechanism of ecological speciation, the only genes required for the evolution of reproductive isolation are genes involved in ecological adaptation. Because no genes for mate choice are required for the process of ecological speciation, it has been referred to as a \"no-gene\" mechanism of assortative mating (Rice 1987; Coyne and Orr 2004) .",

            "text": "Host shifts may represent the most likely scenario for assortative mating to arise via a no-gene mechanism because mate choice is often determined by host preference. For example, assortative mating between host races of the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, may have evolved via selection acting directly on host preference (Feder et al. 1998; Filchak et al. 2000) . In Rhagoletis, a new host race emerged following the introduction of apples to North America. Regardless of whether the host race formation occurred in allopatry before the introduction of apples (Feder et al. 2003) or in sympatry after the introduction, the divergent host preference, itself, may have conferred an ecological adaptation by allowing the new host race to escape resource competition on hawthorns, the ancestral host plant (Feder et al. 1998 ). Thus, assortative mating (host preference) and ecological adaptation in Rhagoletis might have a shared genetic basis. However, the genetic intractability of ecological models such as Rhagoletis has made it difficult to confirm that the same gene underlies both traits. Investigations of more tractable phytophagous insects have localized genes involved in host preference and host performance to shared regions of the genome (Hawthorne and Via 2001) , but no study has confirmed that an individual locus affects both traits.",

Therefore, mate choice in viruses is determined by host specificity (relative ability for a virus to infect one or more host types). However, viruses offer three experimental advantages over insects for monitoring speciation processes in the laboratory. First, viruses evolve rapidly, facilitating the direct empirical observation of speciation, which is more difficult in most other systems (Rice and Hostert 1993) . In particular, the high pernucleotide mutation rates of RNA viruses (Drake 1993) provide extensive genetic variation that fuels evolution by natural selection, making the study of reproductive isolation and speciation especially feasible (Holmes 2004) . Second, in viruses it is possible to identify the individual mutations responsible for host performance and host specificity through whole genome sequencing and classical genetic crosses. Last, it is easy to measure the fitness effects of the individual mutations responsible for reproductive isolation to determine whether these changes occurred via natural selection versus genetic drift.",

One might logically conclude, therefore, that adaptation to a novel host-a host that is not infectible by the wild-type virus-should often produce an evolved virus that no longer infects the ancestral host, so that the host ranges of the closely related wild-type and evolved viruses no longer overlap. However, this conclusion has yet to be experimentally validated. To our knowledge, no study has shown that viral adaptation to a single host led to nonoverlapping host ranges between closely related viruses.",

Viral titers were thus measured in plaqueforming units. After 24-h incubation, plaques were harvested and filtered to obtain a bacteria-free lysate containing the virus progeny for the lineage.

On the mixed-host lawn ECC produced clear plaques, whereas a test phage produced turbid plaques because it could not infect P. syringae pv atrofaciens.

A diluted sample of the lysate was then plated on a mixed-host lawn to estimate the ratio of test virus to ECC after 24 h of growth on ERA (R 24 ). Thus, fitness (relative growth rate) was determined on ERA, but the relative ratio of viruses was tracked by platings on the mixed-host lawns.

This mutation confers the ability to infect two host strains that do not permit infection of 6 wt , including the novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes ERA ( Table 1) . Each of the populations founded by 6 broad was subjected to selection on the novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes by plating the phage population on a lawn of the novel host, incubating for 24 h to allow individual phages to form plaques, harvesting progeny phages from \u223c300 of the resulting plaques, and plating these phages on a fresh lawn of the novel host. This cycle was repeated for 30 days, corresponding to \u223c150 virus generations. The presence of only a single host in the habitat ensured that selection was not acting directly on host range (i.e., host-use specificity; the mechanism by which viruses achieve assortative mating).

These data strongly suggest that narrowed host range genotypes were generally favored by selection, such that viruses featuring this trait either fixed or were on their way to fixation by generation 150. Individual narrow hostrange genotypes isolated from populations E3 and E4 (6 E3narrow , 6 E4narrow ) lost the ability to form plaques on one of the six hosts (P. syringae pv. tomato) within the host range of the ancestral phage 6 broad ( Table 1 ). The narrow host-range genotype isolated from population E1 (6 E1narrow ) lost the ability to form plaques on five hosts, including all four hosts within the host range of 6 wt ( Table 1 ). The disjoint host ranges of 6 E1narrow and 6 wt cause complete reproductive isolation between these genotypes, among the group of bacterial hosts 6 is known to infect (Duffy et al. 2006) . To identify the individual mutations responsible for the narrow host-range phenotypes, we sequenced the genomes of one majority genotype with a narrow host range (e.g., 6 E1narrow ) and one minority genotype with a broad host range (e.g., 6 E1broad ) isolated from populations E1, E3, and E4 after 30 days of evolution (Genbank DQ479436-DQ479456, Fig. 2 ). From sequence data alone, it was possible to identify the individual mutation responsible for the narrow host range of 6 E3narrow . The only mutation that differed between 6 E3narrow and 6 E3broad was the substitution of A31T in the host attachment gene P3 (Fig. 2, E3) , unambiguously identifying this mutation as the sole cause of the narrow host-range phenotype. 6 E4narrow and 6 E4broad differed by this same mutation, A31T in P3, and by two additional mutations in P3, one synonymous and one nonsynonymous (Fig. 2, E4) . Two observations suggest that the A31T mutation in P3 is also responsible for the narrow host range of 6 E4narrow : (1) it is the only convergent mutation shared by 6 E3narrow and 6 E4narrow , and (2) 6 E3narrow and 6 E4narrow show identical narrowed host ranges.",

An additional mutation was found in 6 E1narrow , in the untranslated 3 region of the medium segment, but it was discounted as the cause of the change in host range because none of the 3 noncoding regions in 6 are known to impact function (Mindich 2006) . To narrow our focus, we first isolated a narrow host-range genotype, 6 E1narrow(day20) , from the evolved population at day 20, when the narrow hostrange phenotype was starting to sweep through the population (Fig. 1) . Sequencing only the regions corresponding to the nonsynonymous mutations acquired by the 6 E1narrow lineage, we determined that 6 E1narrow(day20) differed from 6 E1broad by two of the three mutations: A13V in P8 and G247A in P3. Because these mutations existed on different genome segments, we used classic genetic crosses between 6 E1narrow(day20) and 6 E1broad to generate genomes that contained these individual mutations, but were otherwise isogenic to 6 E1broad. In this manner, we confirmed that the P3:G247A mutation was the cause of the narrow host-range phenotype. Addition of this mutation to the 6 E1broad genome recapitulated the narrow host-range phenotype of 6 E1narrow , whereas addition of the P8:A13V mutation did not (Table 1) .",

For each population, we measured the fitness of a genome with the mutation (6 E1broad+P3:G247A , 6 E3narrow , or 6 E4narrow ) relative to the appropriate broad host-range genome without the mutation (6 E1broad , 6 E3broad , or 6 E4broad ). Both mutations in P3 (A31T and G247A) were tested against otherwise isogenic competitors, and both significantly improved fitness, that is, growth rate, on the novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes (Fig. 3) . Thus, in all three populations showing reduced host range (increased host specificity), the phenomenon was caused indirectly by a single mutation that conferred a selective advantage on the novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes (increased host performance).",

However, only two characteristics of the 6 system were critical to our success-the short generation time and the high mutation rate. Other characteristics of the 6 system (e.g., viruses mate in the habitat where they eat) make our results highly relevant to speciation processes in a variety of organisms that share these characteristics (e.g., walking sticks, apple maggot flies, and sticklebacks). However, the pleiotropy between improved performance in a new habitat and increasing specificity has rarely been as clearly observed as it was in our study (e.g., trait associations can also be explained by linkage disequilibrium [Via and Hawthorne 2002] ).

It is generally believed that viruses can progressively evolve by first infecting only a reservoir host, then infecting both a reservoir and novel host, and finally infecting only the novel host (e.g., Kuiken et al. 2006) . Consistent with this idea, laboratory experiments suggest that viruses shift hosts by experiencing an intermediate broad-host-range genotype, rather than instantaneously shifting from one host range to another, nonoverlapping host range. Thus, the vast majority of identified host-range mutations are shown to expand the host breadth of a virus, instead of causing an immediate host-shift (e.g., Zarling et al. 1977; Aytay and Schulze 1991) . Extensive evidence from animal, plant, and bacterial viruses shows that these broad host-range viruses readily lose host range when allowed to adapt to a single host (e.g., reviewed in Fenner and Cairns 1959; Reddy and Black 1974; Marchette et al. 1990; Wichman et al. 1999; Crill et al. 2000; Ebert 2000) . Therefore, our laboratory results showing two reproductively isolated phages (6 wt and 6 E1narrow ) bridged by a broad host-range intermediate (6 broad ) encompass this complete progression. For this reason, our study may reflect how host shifts lead to reproductive isolation in natural virus populations.",

Such experiments suggest a causal relationship between the observed reductions in host range and the general role of host attachment proteins in virus adaptation to new hosts, both in the laboratory (e.g., phage X174 [Crill et al. 2000 ], Vesicular Stomatitis Virus [Z\u00e1rate and Novella 2004] , and SARS Coronavirus [Poon et al. 2005] ) and in nature (e.g., Influenza Virus [Parrish and Kawaoka 2005] , and Canine Parvovirus [Shackelton et al. 2005] ). Because many viruses seem capable of changing host range via only one or two mutations (Baranowski et al. 2001; Rainey et al. 2003; Parrish and Kawaoka 2005; Duffy et al. 2006) , it hints that other RNA viruses have the potential to evolve reproductive isolation through no-gene mechanisms as rapidly as we observed in 6.",

However, because reproductive isolation evolved via a no-gene mechanism in which recombination cannot separate ecological adaptation from assortative mating, we would not expect to obtain a different outcome in the face of gene flow (i.e., in sympatry). In other words, our finding of reproductive isolation via a no-gene mechanism suggests that viral populations could evolve reproductive isolation regardless of whether they were evolving in allopatry or sympatry. In reality, natural virus populations probably often evolve in parapatry. For example, a virus that enters a human host may persist and replicate in that host for tens, hundreds, or perhaps even thousands of generations before it is transmitted to the next human or nonhuman host (Fu 2001; Drummond et al. 2003; Wilson 2004) . Although parapatry may facilitate the evolution of viral host races, as in phytophagous insects (Feder et al. 1998; Hawthorne and Via 2001) , parapatry would nonetheless provide substantial opportunity for gene flow to influence the divergence of RNA virus populations.",

In this scenario, the evolution of reproductive isolation would eliminate a source of beneficial genetic variation for the emerging population. We suspect this consequence of reproductive isolation would not have a major impact on RNA virus disease emergence because the high mutation rate of RNA viruses (Drake 1993) ensures that genetic variation is rarely a limiting factor in adaptation.",

In this case, reproductive isolation that separates the gene pools of ancestral and emerging populations may hasten adaptation of the emerging virus to the novel host. Because the constant immigration of alleles that are maladapted to the novel host is not something that a high mutation rate can easily counter, the strongest consequence of reproductive isolation for emerging RNA viruses may be to stop gene flow from decreasing the rate of adaptation to the novel host. The rapid pace with which reproductive isolation evolved in our experiments suggests that gene flow is unlikely to slow the adaptation of emerging RNA viruses for very long.",
