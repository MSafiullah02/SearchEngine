An imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis resulting from endothelium injury induced by activated oxidative stress, which predisposes to both hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis, has consistently presented itself in the intravascular events [5], [6]; while predominant lipid transportation to peripheral tissue and elevated adipogenesis via up-regulated proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) expression is involved in the extravascular events [7], [8]. Although it has been experimentally confirmed that a combined administration of an anticoagulant with a lipid-lowering agent may help prevent steroid-associated ON [9], the ideal strategy would be to simultaneously target both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid deposition to prevent steroid-associated ON development [4].",

Our previously published studies showed that, using our established rabbit model [12], Epimedium-derived flavonoids (EF, composed of seven flavonoid compounds with parent ring) (Fig. 1\nA) demonstrated beneficial effects in the prevention of steroid-associated ON with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition in a dose-dependent manner [13], [14]. Our more recent study on intestinal metabolism of EF has shown that a single molecule Icaritin (ICT) (Fig. 1B) may be involved in intestinal metabolism of those seven flavonoid compounds with parent ring in EF, which corresponds to the recent consensus that diversiform isoflavones with a parent ring may be intestinally metabolized to a single Equal for acting on pharmacological targets [15], [16] and Icaritin may be involved in enzymatic hydrolysis of prenylated flavonols [17].",

Under general and deep anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital, the abdomen cavity was opened for perfusion with a confected radiopaque silicone rubber, using our previously established protocol[13]. Then, the bilateral proximal femora were dissected for micro-CT-based three-dimensional (3-D) angiography after specimen decalcification, including a histogram generated to display size (thickness) distribution of angiographic structural units and a color-coded scale mapped to the surface of the 3-D images to provide a visual representation of size distribution of angiographic structural units[12], [13]. Histopathological examination was performed to identify local ON lesion by established criteria, i.e. diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in the trabeculae accompanied by surrounding necrotic bone marrow [43]. Each rabbit that had at least one ON lesion in the areas was considered as ON+, while that without ON lesion was considered as ON\u2212. ON incidence was defined as numbers of ON+ rabbits divided by numbers of total rabbits in each group, and ON extent was defined as numbers of ON lesions per ON+ rabbit [12], [13]. Intravascular thrombosis index (thrombotic vessle counts), extravascular lipid-deposition index (fat cell area fraction) [41] and size distribution of extravascular leakage particles during angiography were also quantified histomorphometrically [14], [44]. Local vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was graded by a semi-quantitative estimation of immunoreactivity: negative (\u2212), weak (+), moderate (++), strong (+++) [45]. The body weight of each rabbit before sacrifice was documented and survival condition throughout the experiment period in each group was recorded.",

This is comparable to the prevention effect of Epimedium-derived flavonoids at employed dosages (10 mg/kg and 20\u201340 mg/kg) shown in our previous studies [13], [14]. This study also provides experimental explanation for the previously noted clinical observation that ON prevalence was lower in SARS patients frequently prescribed crude extract of Epimedium in southern China than those seldom prescribed crude extract of Epimedium in northern China [10], [11], [18]. On the other hand, no significant difference in the ON extent among the three groups (Fig. 3B) was observed suggesting that a threshold exists beyond which ON is initiated, which is consistent with the findings in our recent study [13] and other researchers' study [9]. It also indicated that Icaritin was able to modulate the ON threshold. However, once the threshold was reached, Icaritin had little effect on occurrence of ON.",

GSH/LPO in plasma is a biochemical marker indicating level of oxidation stress [22]. GSH stabilizes lysosomal membrane suppressing vascular endothelium injury by inhibiting increase in lipoperoxides and maintaining cellular oxidation balance in favor of reduction [23], [24], [25]. LPO is generated by hyperoxidation of lipids, a biochemical indicator of tissue injury by active oxygens, closely associated with vascular injury [26], [27]. In the present study, a significant decrease in GSH/LPO in CON group at week 1 post-induction was found (Fig. 4D), which was consistent with the findings of an experimental study of steroid-induced ON in rabbits [6]. The close correlation between GSH/LPO and TM (R\n2\n = 0.78) at 1 week post-induction strongly suggested that activated oxidative stress was involved in endothelium injury at an early stage during steroid-associated ON development. Our results also indicated that Icaritin was able to protect the endothelium from oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by a significant decrease in GSH/LPO in the CON group which was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost negated in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction. This implied a protective effect of Icaritin on intravascular endothelium injury resulting from activated oxidative stress. This is not unexpected given that several flavonoids family agents derived from herbs have been identified as potential therapeutic antioxidants in different animal models [28], [29], [30].",

In the present study, a significant increase in PPARgamma protein expression in the CON group at week 1 post-induction was found (Figs. 4G, H), corresponding to an up-regulated PPARgamma expression at mRNA level during steroid-associated ON development in our published animal studies [13], [14]. The close correlation between the up-regulated PPARgamma expression and increased adipocyte positive colonies (R\n2\n = 0.86) at week 1 post-induction in the present study strongly indicated that adipogenic protein PPARgamma was involved in the pathogenic mechanism of excessive extravascular adipogenesis at early stage of steroid-associated ON development. Our results also indicated that Icaritin was able to dose-dependently down-regulate PPARgamma protein expression, as evidenced by the significantly up-regulated PPARgamma protein expression in the CON group which was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction, suggesting that suppression of PPARgamma protein expression contributes to the inhibitory effect of Icaritin on extravascular adipogenesis for lipid deposition. This is not surprising given that a series of herb-derived flavonoid/isoflavone family agents have been shown to be potential down-regulators of PPARgamma for anti-adipogenic [33].",

VEGF is an important signaling protein for physiological and pathological angiogenesis under hypoxia condition [35]. The results also indicated that Icaritin was able to dose-dependently maintain \u201cvascular quantity\u201d at an early stage, as evidenced by the following three functional-, structural-, and molecular-level evidences. First, the significantly decreased PEP in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 5A\u2013C). Second, the reduced perfusion to vessel-like structural units (36\u2013200 \u00b5m or 400\u2013600 \u00b5m) was hardly observed in the H-ICT group but was occasionally in the L-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Fig. 7, Fig. 5). Third, the moderate (++) immunoreactivity in the CON group was attenuated to (+/++) in the L-ICT group and prevented to (+) in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction, suggesting that local hypoxia was relieved by Icaritin (Figs. 2E\u2013H).",

This could be explained by local hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, as evidenced by local VEGF expression which was maintained at high level in the CON group throughout the experimental period. Icaritin was able to continuously relieve local hypoxia condition during steroid-associated ON development, as reflected by the continuously maintained high expression of VEGF in the CON group being attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group throughout the experimental period (Figs. 2E\u2013H).",

Micro-CT based angiography indicated the presence of many medium-sized disseminated leakage-particle-like structural units (200\u2013400 \u00b5m) at week 1 post-induction compared to baseline (Fig. 7A). This consistency in \u201cvascular permeability\u201d between dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI based functional evidence and micro-CT based structural evidence suggested that local impairment of local blood supply in the CON group at an early stage could be secondary to endothelium injury, a likelihood that was supported by a significant increase in serum TM in the CON group at week 1 post-induction. These findings also concur with a recent work reporting an increase in vascular permeability in steroid-induced ON model [6]. Our results also indicated that Icaritin was able to control \u201cvascular permeability\u201d at an early stage in a dose-dependent manner, as supported by the following two functional- and structural-level evidences: 1) the significantly increased PS\u03c1 in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 5A, B, D); and 2) numerous medium-sized disseminated leakage-particle-like structural units (200\u2013400 \u00b5m, and confirmed histologically as by leakage particles) (Figs. 7G, 7H) in the CON group were not found in the H-ICT group but found only occasionally in the L-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 7B, C).",
