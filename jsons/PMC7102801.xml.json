Extensive beef farming has been encouraged by financial incentives such as the EU Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS) (Crosson et al., 2006) and also to develop production systems involving lower inorganic fertiliser Nitrogen input. Many farmers would thus need to operate to lower input criteria than heretofore, as determined by environmental legislation such as the Nitrates Directive of the European Union (EU) (Directive 91/676/EEC) and (or) stipulated in REPS. Consequently, grassland management systems may reduce in intensity and thus, there is a need to develop more extensive, REPS-compatible, systems of suckler beef production.",

            "text": "Within the context of a grassland-based spring-calving suckler beef production system, matching grass supply to animal requirements during the grazing season, while ensuring sufficient silage is produced for the indoor winter period, is largely achieved by balancing the use of fertiliser N and SR by altering the emphasis on harvesting grass by grazing or as silage. Thus, whereas harvesting grass for silage facilitates the concurrent and subsequent utilisation of grass by grazing (McGee, 2005), and the use of two silage harvests have traditionally been advocated for moderately intensive spring-calving suckler beef production systems (Drennan, 1993) the considerable cost often associated with a second-harvest silage (O'Kiely et al., 1997) makes it necessary to consider replacing the two-harvest system with a simpler one-harvest system. Previous research has suggested the possibility of a lower fertiliser N grass-based system involving one, staggered silage cut particularly, where qualification for REPS is dependent on moderate stocking densities (Drennan and McGee, 2008).",

The maximum number of paddocks was 76, grouped into 19 sets of four of equal size (balanced for location and soil type) and randomly assigned to two grazing management Systems. Because of differences in cow (and progeny) numbers annually, the area of land used changed accordingly. At pasture there were 2 replicates per System for the cows and calves (4 herds), whereas the Systems for the yearlings were not replicated (2 herds). Average paddock size was 1.02 ha (ranged from 0.56 to 1.42 ha) and each paddock had its own water supply. The same total area of land was assigned to each System so consequently, in order to achieve the required SR, the number of cow units on the INT system was 1.25 of the EXT system. The paddocks assigned to grazing and silage harvesting were generally the same over the duration of the study. The allocation of cows to the Systems was random within genotype as they calved and did not take account of the treatments imposed in previous years (Wright et al., 1994, Drennan and McGee, 2004, Drennan and McGee, 2008). The progeny remained within their allocated Systems until slaughter but were offered the same silage to avoid the possibility of differences between Systems from factors not associated with the treatments such as preservation quality. The cows were offered the grass silage from their respective treatments for Years 1 to 4 but subsequently, for logistic reasons, were offered the same grass silage.",

In the EXT system, only one staggered silage harvest was planned with half of the area cut at the same time as the INT system (24 May) with the remainder deferred and conserved (14 days was planned) 17 days later (10 June s.d. 2.8 days). Grass was precision-chop harvested, usually with minimal wilting and with the addition of an acid-based additive when required and, ensiled in unroofed, horizontal clamps which were rolled thoroughly, before sheeting with 2 layers of polythene and covering with tyres. The objective was to produce high nutritive value first-harvest grass silage for the progeny and moderate nutritive value silage for the cows in the deferred (EXT) and second harvest (INT). The cutting date of the second and deferred harvest was delayed to produce a higher yield, of lower digestibility silage (at a lower cost unit\u2212 1 DM) as this is adequate for spring-calving beef suckler cows with relatively modest energy requirements for production because they were not lactating for most of the indoor winter period (Drennan and McGee, 2004).

At least circa 30 estimates were taken in a \u201cW\u201d fashion per paddock. Furthermore, in Years 1 (1997) and 3 (1999) pre- and post-grazing herbage yield (above the 4 cm horizon) was determined on a minimum of four strips of grass (0.53 or 0.56 m wide, 5.0 or 4.5 m long) per paddock cut with a lawnmower or an Agria mower when pre-grazing yields were high. The grass from each strip was weighed and sampled. The herbage from the four samples was composited and a sub-sample (ca 100 g) was obtained for dry matter (DM) determination (24 h at 98 \u00b0C) and a further sub-sample (ca 200 g) was obtained for chemical analysis. Following drying at 40 \u00b0C for 48 h these samples were milled and analysed for dry matter digestibility (DMD) (Tilley and Terry, 1963) and crude protein (CP) (Kjeldhal nitrogen \u00d7 6.25). Apparent herbage intake was estimated for the cows and calves in Year 1 as the difference between pre- and post-grazing herbage masses plus estimated grass growth (measured in a separate experiment at the centre) during the residency time divided by the number of animals in the paddock and the number of days grazing the paddock. Each year the in vitro DMD was determined on representative samples of the grass silages.",

            "text": "Previous research has shown that compared to a grassland management system based on two harvests of grass silage, a system based on one single, deferred harvest of grass silage adversely affects the live weight gain of the progeny during the indoor winter period due to a lower nutritive value of the forage (Drennan and McGee, 2008). Consequently, the rationale behind the planned staggered, single-harvest silage in the EXT system was for the early-harvest to provide high nutritive value grass silage for the progeny and the deferred harvest to provide adequate nutritive value for the cow of similar digestibility to the second harvest in the INT system. Herbage digestibility for primary growths typically declines with advancing maturity or delayed harvest date by 3.9 to 5.7 g day\u2212 1 (Keady and O'Kiely, 1998, Keady et al., 2000, Kyne et al., 2001). However, the difference in DMD values between the early and deferred first harvests (716 g kg\u2212 1 vs. 689 g kg\u2212 1) did not reflect the 17 d difference in mean harvest date. This can be partially attributed to the fact that varying proportions of silage areas were grazed in spring prior to closing for silage thus, enhancing the digestibility of the herbage harvested (O'Neill et al., 2001, Kyne et al., 2001). Nevertheless, this strategy was largely achieved as indicated by the relatively similar DMD of deferred (689 g kg\u2212 1) and second (674 g kg\u2212 1) harvest silages.",

This small difference may be due to the greater land area taken up for the single silage harvesting and thus, a higher SR during the first part of the grazing season resulting in a decline in cow milk yield and consequently calf growth (Drennan and McGee, 2008). However, calf live weight gain during the first grazing season and pre-weaning did not differ between the two Systems. Audic et al. (2002) also found that decreasing SR by about 0.23 and nitrogen fertilisation rate by about 0.63 did not adversely affect the live weight gain of suckling calves on rotationally grazed systems. In accord with cow performance, where concurrent reductions in both SR and fertiliser N do not occur, calf weaning weight can also be adversely affected (Drennan and McGee, 2008). The pre-weaning live weight gain of the calves in the present Systems were in excess of 1.0 kg day\u2212 1 over the grazing season. These values are somewhat lower than previous reports of spring-calving rotationally grazed, temperate grassland systems (Drennan and McGee, 2004, Audic et al., 2002, Drennan and McGee, 2008). This can be attributed to differences in cow genotype and age between studies as the actual magnitude of calf weight gain is largely influenced by the milk yield of the dam (McGee et al., 2005b).",

The daily live weight gain during the indoor finishing period was similar to previous findings for bull (Drennan and McGee, 2004) and steer (Drennan et al., 2005) progeny on similar production systems, but the performance of the heifer progeny was lower than the results (1187 g day\u2212 1) obtained by Drennan et al. (1997). However, in terms of animal growth, caution is required in interpreting comparisons with other studies, particularly for individual components of production systems, because, independent of animal genetic merit and nutrient supply availability, there are interactions among previous nutrition and management (both indoors and grazing) and subsequent animal performance, mainly concerning compensatory growth potential (e.g. Drennan and Harte, 1979). Additionally, estimating carcass weight gain rather than live weight gain in experiments of this type is important (Keating and O'Kiely, 2000). In the present study, carcass weight per day of age was in good agreement with the findings of Drennan and McGee (2004) for heifers (481 g day\u2212 1) and bulls (742 g day\u2212 1) and with Drennan et al. (2005) for steers (507 g day\u2212 1) produced on similar grass-based systems. Assuming equal numbers of male and female progeny produced cow\u2212 1 unit, for heifer plus steer production the progeny carcass output ha\u2212 1 was 458 and 370 kg for the INT and EXT systems, respectively. Corresponding values for heifer plus bull production were 549 and 446 kg. This compares with values of 756 and 538 kg ha\u2212 1 for conventional and extensive, respectively, dairy calf-to-beef systems (Keane and Allen, 1998). The output differences between suckler and dairy calf-to-beef systems largely reflect the maintenance cost of the beef suckler cow. The calculations above did not include carcass output from the cow when culled.",

            "text": "Surplus N within grassland-based production systems is susceptible to loss to the wider environment. In accord with previous studies (Lawes et al., 2000, Drennan and McGee, 2008) only small proportions of the N inputs were converted to animal product i.e. live weight gain. The purchased N inputs to the two Systems were limited to chemical fertiliser and concentrate supplement. Assuming a CP concentration in the purchased concentrate of 140 g kg\u2212 1, this equated to an intake of 13 and 17 kg N per finished animal for steer and bull production, respectively. Combining the chemical fertiliser N applied, the total purchased N input was 228 and 117, and 245 and 119 kg ha\u2212 1 for INT and EXT systems of steer and bull production, respectively. Ignoring N sequestered in the soil and assuming a N content of live weight gain of 28 g kg\u2212 1 (Lawes et al., 2000) the corresponding N removal by the cow and progeny was 25 and 20, and 29 and 24 kg ha\u2212 1 equating to a N surplus of 204 and 97, and 216 and 95 kg ha\u2212 1 for the INT and EXT systems of steer and bull production, respectively. So in accord with previous findings, reducing fertiliser N use reduces the N surplus in beef systems (Lawes et al., 2000). Data collected for the present Systems showed that compared to the INT system the reduced SR and fertiliser N input of the EXT system significantly reduced nitrate levels in soil water (Richards et al., 2007). The N-use efficiency for the INT and EXT systems of steer and bull production were 0.11 and 0.17, and 0.12 and 0.20, respectively. Similarly, Dieguez Cameroni et al. (2006) reported an apparent N efficiency of 0.13, 0.15 and 0.26 during the grazing period for growing fattening bulls on high N-high SR, moderate N-high SR and zero N-low SR systems, respectively. Lowering the levels of N fertilisation used with a concurrent appropriate reduction in SR reduces N losses of ruminants with little or no change in their nutrition or in individual performance (Peyraud and Astigarraga, 1998).",

Furthermore, in terms of N input, the EXT System was compatible with the Nitrates Directive of the EU (Directive 91/676/EEC) which limited organic N to 170 kg ha\u2212 1. Additionally, this System was compatible with the REPS operated in Ireland to date where the maximum permissible level of organic N was 170 kg ha\u2212 1 and total (organic plus inorganic) N was 260 kg ha\u2212 1. At the stipulated annual organic N loads of 65, 24 and 57 kg for a beef suckler cow, animals 0\u20131 and 1\u20132 years old, respectively, the total organic N on the INT and EXT systems of steer and bull production was 192 and 155, and 205 and 166 kg ha\u2212 1 in that order. Addition of inorganic fertiliser N applied gave a corresponding total N input of 402 and 257, and 419 and 260 kg ha\u2212 1. Under the new REPS scheme now operated in Ireland (Council Regulation (EC) No. 1698/2005\u201311th August 2007), the INT system also qualifies, provided participants farming above 170 kg organic N ha\u2212 1 have a valid Nitrates derogation.",
