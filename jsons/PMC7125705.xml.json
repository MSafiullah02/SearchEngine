Nowadays, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), class swine fever virus (CSFV) and many other RNA viruses are threatening the porcine health worldwide. During the replication of the viruses in swine cells, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is normally produced by most RNA viruses. The majority diseases of economic importance in swine industry such as Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), Classical swine fever (CSF), Swine vesicular disease (SVD), Foot and mouth disease (FMD), Transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs (TGE) and Influenza are caused by RNA viruses. The dsRNA intermediates during virus replication induce host innate immune response. During innate immune response, host toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes these genomic viral dsRNA generated during viral replication [1]. The interaction of dsRNA with TLR3 is a potent inducer of type I IFN cascade genes for antiviral action.",

Our earlier work discovered that compared with the untreated porcine kidney epithelial cell lines (PK15), 76 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in PolyI:C treated cells (P < 0.05) [2]. Out of these DEGs, eighteen are involved in epigenetic modifications or encode DNA methylation enzymes, such as DNA methylation-related gene DNMT3A (DNA methyltransferase 3A), MGMT (O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) and etc. [2]. Galli et al. demonstrated that PolyI:C-mediated activation of TLR3 induces miRNAs targeting DNA methyltransferases, leading to demethylation and re-expression of the oncosuppressor retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR\u00df) [3]. DNA methylation is one kind of key factors in epigenetic modifications [2,4]. Previous studies proved that hyper-methylated promoter and consequently decreased expression of immune related genes can be induced by virus challenge [2,5,6]. However, the DNA methylation profiles and how they regulate target genes expressions in dsRNA infected porcine cells remain largely unknown.",

It is well known that indigenous Chinese Tongcheng pigs reportedly showed strong resistance to PRRSV infection. The integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression revealed that down-regulated methylation-related genes (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were targeted by five up-regulated differentially expressed miRNAs. The results lay a strong foundation for developing novel therapies to control PRRS in pigs [7].

Based on the CpG density, gene promoter was divided into three molds: High-, Intermediate- and Low-CpG-containing promoter (abbreviated as HCP, ICP and LCP, respectively). To clearly map the patterns of DNA methylation on promoters, each promoter was divided into two regions relative to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of a gene: proximal (\u2212200 to +200 bp) and intermediate (\u2212800 to \u2212200 bp) (Fig. 1\n).

In the comparison of A vs. C, HCPs with proximal methylation profile (\u201801\u2019) seems to be less transcriptionally active than intermediate and fully methylation profiles (\u201810\u2019 and \u201811\u2019) (Fig. 2A, P < 0.01). This finding suggest that hypermethylation on genes promoter is associated with decreases in cellular transcript levels and Aza-CdR has genome-wide effect on viral mimic dsRNA in vitro.",

Of 15 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the comparisons of P vs. C, 3 genes expression were up-regulated driven by lower methylation (accounting for 20% of 15 genes, blue scatter plots in Fig. 2B). Of 37 DEGs in the comparisons of A vs. C, 9 were up-regulated expression driven by lower methylation (24%, blue scatter plots in Fig. 2B), 5 were down-regulation expression driven by higher methylation (14%, red scatter plots in Fig. 2B). Especially, of 18 DEGs in the comparisons of (P + A) vs. C, 3 were up- and 3 were down-regulated expression driven by lower and higher methylation (each account for 17%, blue and red scatter plots in Fig. 2B), respectively. The details of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulated by promoter methylation were showed in Table S1. We found that around 20% of differentially methylated genes (three DEGs were PPARG, TNKS2 and ERV-PK15) in PolyI:C extracellular treated PK15 cells were negatively regulated by promoter methylation at transcriptional level. The data also indicated that around 38% of DEGs in A vs. C (14 DEGs were showed in Table S1) and 34% of DEGs in (P + A) vs. C (6 DEGs were showed in Table S1) were negatively regulated by promoter methylation at transcriptional level. Surprisingly, remaining 80% DEGs hypomethylated and decreased in gene expression were observed in P vs. C (Fig. S2, blue scatters in the third quadrant), suggesting active demethylation rather than only passive demethylation, as might be expected in dsRNA treated porcine cells.",

A total of 58, 75 and 82 genes with different methylation modification were identified in the comparisons of P vs. C, A vs. C and (P + A) vs. C, respectively (see Table S3). Using UCSC and RefSeq database, these genes were found involved in different biological function. In ten down-methylated biological processes (BPs, numbers of gene more than eight in each BP), the critical five in P vs. C include regulation of growth, protein modification process, developmental process, cellular component organization, multicellular organismal development. In (P + A) vs. C, the top five of nine down-methylated BPs were gene expression, embryo development, G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle, response to virus, reproduction of translational initiation. In A vs. C, just 2/17 BPs were down-methylation, containing cellular process involved in reproduction and response to virus. Up-methylated genes mainly enriched in induction of apoptosis by extracellular signals, metamorphosis and cell projection assembly and regulation of Rho protein signal transduction (see Fig. 3, Table S2 and S4, red bars: up-methylated genes, blue bars: down-methylated genes). These data indicated that the effects of Aza-CdR on gene expression in PK15 cells were largely independent of cell growth and cellular morphology. The common significant GO terms (P < 0.05) in the comparisons of A vs. C and (P + A) vs. C were \u201cresponse to virus\u201d (GO ID: 0009615) and \u201cdefense response to virus\u201d (GO ID: 0051607), which imply that Aza-CdR has a favorable defense effects on the viral-intermediate dsRNA extracellular treatment.

Comparing the control to each treatment, the DNA methylation levels of the genes encoding porcine proteins, miRNA, miscRNA, pseudogenes, retrotransposon, rRNA, snoRNA and snRNA were analyzed (see Fig. 4\n). We found that the promoter regions of pseudogenes showed hypermethylation causing transcriptional repression. The DNA methylation level of retrotransposon genes was hypomethylated in the control cells (see Fig. 4, control), nevertheless after treated with PolyI:C followed by the addition of Aza-CdR, the retrotransposon was up-methylated (see Fig. 4, PolyI:C + Aza-CdR) in PK15 cells. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) represents a potential marker or mediator of environmental exposures (e.g., virus infection) in the development of chronic complex diseases. ERVWE1 is so far the only verified HERV proviral locus that has retained a long env ORF. Hypermethylation of ERVWE1 observed in non-placental cells has been linked with transcriptional repression [14]. Here, we found the up-methylation induced by Aza-CdR may repress the activation of retrotransposon in PolyI:C treated PK15 cells.",

By means of the treatment of virus mimics and chemical genomic screening for epigenetic modification, MeDIP-chip and transcriptional microarray are cost-effective methods to identify methylation targeted regions and genes [22,23]. Combined methylation alteration regions with gene expression information can dissect the functional-related gene involved in virus replication and anti viral responses. Promoter methylation variation was observed in CDK9 gene which is enriched in the GO term of response to virus, as well as in ZC3HAV1 and BNIP3L genes that are involved in defense response to virus in P vs. C and (P + A) vs. C. Of which, CDK9 gene encodes cyclin-dependent kinase 9 and is a positive transcriptional elongation factor for the virus-encoded Tat protein activity [24,25]. Cyclin T1/CDK9 interacts with influenza A virus polymerase to inhibit virus transcription and replication [26]. Its character of down-methylation while up-expression in PolyI:C or PolyI:C plus Aza-CdR treated cells could serve as biomarker for virus replication in the swine cells. BNIP3L gene (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19kD-interacting protein 3-like) can function as virus-induced tumor repressor, which encodes a homologue of NIP3, a protein that interacts with adenovirus E1B19kD protein and host BCL2 protein [27,28]. The mRNA of the pro-apoptotic gene BNIP3L was significantly decreased following murine coronavirus (a signal strand RNA) infection, evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival [29]. Its down-methylation while very significant up-expression in PolyI:C plus Aza-CdR treated cells (Fig. S3A and Table S5) means BNIP3L could be a powerful candidate gene of anti virus infection. ZC3HAV1 is an interferon-inducible genes and encodes zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) [30]. Through binding to the viral RNA and recruiting the processing exosome, human ZAP causes the degradation of viral RNA [31]. Although the expression of ZC3HAV1 was up-regulated by PolyI:C or Aza-CdR alone (Fig. S3D), its up-methylation but down-expression in PolyI:C plus Aza-CdR treated cells (blue bar in Fig. S3D) suggest that the anti viral function of ZAP in PK15 cells can be induced by dsRNA or methyltransferase inhibitor but cannot be improved by both.",

TRMT6 is part of a two component methyltransferase in yeast, which is involved in the post-translational modification and produces the modified nucleoside 1-methyladenosine in tRNAs [34]. In human, modified nucleoside 1-methyladenosine causes initiator methionine stability and may be involved in the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [35,36]. The up-expression of tRNA methyltransferase may cause hypermethylation of tRNA. RNA virus usually encode proteins to encounter the dsRNA-induced cellular defense. Cell nucleolin is a central hub for the replication of pathogenic RNA viruses. Previous study suggests that non-structural 1 protein (NS1) of influenza A (H3N2) could induce nucleolar stress based on epigenetic alteration of rRNA gene promoter via interaction with nucleolin [37]. In A vs. C comparison, promoter methylation of LOC100511875 has been linked with maturation of 5.8S rRNA and defense response to virus. Moreover, porcine retroviral oncogene MYB was down-methylated and activated in dsRNA treated PK15 cells. MYB encodes nuclear DNA-binding proteins and is involved in G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [36]. The activation of oncogene MYB in PolyI:C treated cells means it could be a biomarker of dsRNA treatment. Retroviruses can selectively trigger an array of innate immune responses through various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), ZC3HAV1 was decreased two to eight folds that examined whether avian leukosis virus induces or inhibits innate immune host responses [38], the results resembled to our study.",

Thus, TLR3 receptor can be specially expressed in immune cells and non-immune cells, e.g. kidney epithelial cells [1]. The experiment was focusing on the extracellular PolyI:C stimulation rather than transfected PolyI:C. With regard to dsRNAs, TLR3, RIG-1 and MDA-5 pathways were different each other, thus there could be difference between the treatment of extracellular PolyI:C and transfected PolyI:C [45,46]. DNA methylation mechanism underlying the discrimination between extracellular delivery of PolyI:C treatment for different times remains to be elucidated.",
