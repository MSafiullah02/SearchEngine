In addition, there is little agreement across global vaccine development funders on which epidemic infectious disease investments should be prioritised, which stems from an absence of global research and development portfolio strategy and coordination.4\n",

This information has previously neither been collated systematically nor has its actual development status been confirmed. Moreover, evidence on the cost of pharmaceutical research and development has been made available since at least the 1950s; however, this has been limited to mainly chemical drug products. Whereas publications by Di Masi and colleagues have provided the foundations on which numerous analyses or critiques of pharmaceutical research and development costs have since been conducted, evidence on vaccine-specific research and development costs for epidemic infectious diseases has been limited. The handful of articles published to date are either descriptive, based on expert opinions with limited data inputs to validate those claims, or focusing on single pathogens or only on clinical research and development phases. Recent studies have attempted to overcome several of the above limitations, focusing their analyses on poverty diseases or epidemic infectious diseases, as well as differentiating more systematically between costs associated with incremental versus breakthrough innovations.\nAdded value of this study\nOur study presents a comprehensive dataset of vaccine research and development candidates against 11 epidemic infectious diseases, which combines a systematic search of a substantially sized literature and the confirmation of current development status of these candidates by vaccine developers active in the field. Moreover, our study attempts to overcome some of the limitations identified in previous vaccine research and development cost analyses in several ways. First, we consider probability of success distributions drawn from multiple published estimates, acknowledging uncertainties in research and development which cannot be explained by single sources. Second, we draw our cost data from both historically incurred and projected cost estimates in infectious disease vaccine research and development, as reported by vaccine developers who are active specifically in the field of epidemic infectious diseases. This gives us confidence that the baseline cost estimates informing our models can provide a more accurate reflection of total investments needed for vaccine development. Third, our collected data suggest that costs associated with new technologies may not differ from costs associated with well-established technologies\u2014a finding that is contradictory to prevailing assumptions made in extant literature. Our analysis suggests that it is indirect costs, and variations in costs associated with different levels of experience of the organisations developing these products, that drive cost estimates in upward directions.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nWe demonstrate that it is possible to combine up-to-date evidence on vaccine research and development pipelines with rigorous cost analysis methods to generate robust estimates of vaccine research and development investment needs in epidemic infectious diseases. Our methods and findings can benefit future assessments of global health research and development costs, improving the credibility of funding need claims and of portfolio planning.\n",

Second, we tested for drivers of vaccine development costs drawn from published studies, using various statistical techniques. Third, we drew vaccine research and development probabilities of success from published estimates. We combined these with self-reported cost data to simulate costs adjusted for probability of success for advancing vaccines from preclinical testing through to phase 2a, within a Monte Carlo framework.

Acknowledging that not all pipeline information is publicly available, nor updated regularly, we confirmed the status of the vaccines identified in the literature by sending a survey to 414 organisations. The survey asked recipients to: validate the current status of development of a pre-filled list of vaccine candidates that our team had collated via literature searches, grant database searches and clinical trial registries searches over the past 12 months prior to survey launch, including information on disease, phase of development, vaccine technology type, and product development partners; clarify current sources of funding, development costs incurred and future funding needs for bringing the vaccines through phase 2 and potentially phase 3 in response to potential disease outbreaks, including stockpile estimates for phase 3 trials and for emergency use (the latter not reported in the paper); specify main drivers of R&D costs and technical success to date and identify potential drivers of future costs and technical risks for bringing vaccine candidates through late phases of clinical development.

Given the relevance of vaccine developer licensure track record and a large variation in self-reported costs not explained by regression or clustering analyses (appendix), we incorporated this uncertainty into a Monte Carlo simulation. Specifically, we defined cost distributions for lower and upper bounds by dividing our sample into two groups: a lower bound group associated with costs reported by product developers with no vaccine licensure track record; and an upper bound group associated with costs reported by product developers with previous licensure experience. For each group, we constructed discrete cost distributions by research and development phase, assigning equal probabilities to the respective self-reported cost estimates. In addition to costs, we constructed triangular distributions for probability of success by research and development phase. Triangular distributions were chosen since they are commonly used to define ranges of values for uncertain variables where available data is either scarce or heterogeneous enough to not clearly dictate the appropriate range and frequency of the possible values of variables.37 They are characterised by minimum, maximum, and modal, or most likely, values that collectively define the boundaries and shape of the distribution triangles (appendix).",

Several stochastic modelling approaches have been proposed in pharmaceutical research and development management to address various portfolio optimisation problems (see literature overview in appendix).38 Drawing from previous evidence, we built a two-stage stochastic optimisation model\u2014ie, a stepwise optimisation of objectives that includes uncertainty\u2014to identify optimal research and development portfolios and costs for progressing at least one vaccine candidate per epidemic infectious disease through to end of phase 2a. In stage 1, we derived the minimum number of ideal candidates required to achieve at least one phase 2b\u20133 ready candidate for an epidemic infectious disease, starting from preclinical testing, to phase 1 and phase 2, respectively. Using this information against the evidence on available pipelines per epidemic infectious disease, we derived the minimum and maximum number of vaccine candidates needed by research and development phase to progress at least one of these through to end of phase 2a. In stage 2, we drew from stage 1 findings to define lower and upper boundaries of vaccine candidates by research and development phase, on the basis of which we estimated the minimum cost of successfully developing at least one phase 2b\u20133 ready candidate per epidemic infectious disease.",

Under a low probability of success scenario, the successful progression of a vaccine through to end of phase 2a cannot be guaranteed for Nipah, given the available candidates for this epidemic infectious disease. Vaccine pipelines for Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome comprise too few candidates for any phase 2a outcomes to be predicted through investments in these, even under a more optimistic probability of success.",

This analysis demonstrates that whereas zero phase 2a outcomes are unlikely given the numbers of vaccine candidates supported by research and development phase under the low and high probability of success scenarios, outcomes previously mentioned and beyond one phase 2b\u20133 ready candidate per epidemic infectious disease are dependent on the probability of success. In a scenario in which low costs were associated with high probability of success distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be supported as per the high probability of success and high cost scenario to achieve minimum phase 2a outcomes per epidemic infectious disease, but the overall portfolio cost would reduce to US$1\u00b76 billion ($715 million\u20132\u00b79 billion range). In contrast, in a scenario where high costs were associated with low probability of success distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be funded as per the low probability of success and low cost scenario to successfully advance at least one vaccine through to end of phase 2a successfully. In this case, however, the associated portfolio cost would increase to $6\u00b78 billion ($1\u00b75\u201315\u00b71 billion range; appendix).",

Our analysis identifies several disease areas for which the upstream vaccine research and development pipeline today is insufficient, and highlights the need for entry of new vaccine candidates into preclinical development if the chances of minimum vaccine research and development preparedness targets are to be increased. Moreover, we demonstrate that higher vaccine research and development costs, and in particular clinical research and development costs, are likely to be associated with greater industrial sector affiliation and previous licensure experience of vaccine developers. If this experience were assumed to translate to higher probability of success, investing in these projects could progress more epidemic infectious disease vaccines through to end of phase 2a.",

Second, we draw our cost data from both historically incurred and projected cost estimates in infectious disease vaccine research and development, as reported by vaccine developers who are active specifically in the field of epidemic infectious diseases. This gives us confidence that the baseline cost estimates informing our models can provide a more accurate reflection of total investments needed for epidemic infectious disease vaccine development.",

This may be because of the compounding complexities of certain pathogens that make it difficult to disassociate pathogen-specific from technology-specific cost drivers, unless one has access to more granular cost data. However, a more plausible explanation perhaps is that cost variations are strongly associated with business models, rather than the technologies themselves, by which the various vaccine developers in epidemic infectious diseases are operating in the industry or non-industry sector.35 Our statistical analysis suggests that platform technologies are not a substantial explanatory factor for average vaccine development project costs, even if we control for the assumption that the data may be nested with respect to the individual pathogens. Instead, it is indirect costs and variations in costs associated with different levels of experience in the organisations developing these products that drive cost estimates upward.",

First, the average vaccine development project cost estimates, from which our simulation-optimisation approach draws, are based on self-reported data by vaccine developers. Despite the statistical analyses and our consistency checks with CEPI and literature sources to minimise bias, such bias is likely to persist in any self-reported cost projections. This implies a certain price for innovation that vaccine developers are willing to accept in order to engage in research and development, which may differ across sectors and organisations operating with different business models and internal cost structures.39 However, in practice, project costs in areas of relatively low commercial potential are more likely to be established by payer\u2013developer negotiations around risk and benefit sharing, which balances payer constraints with the developers' appetite for financial risk exposure. Coupled with unexpected circumstances, such as unforeseen regulatory requirements, or technological spillovers from other research and development activities, such factors may well drive realised vaccine research and development expenditures either way, downwards or upwards, compared with the estimates provided in this study.",

On one hand, higher probability of success associated with less experienced vaccine developers could well mean that the portfolio costs of achieving at least one phase 2a outcome per priority epidemic infectious disease would be lower than our analysis suggests.

This may also suggest that, in practice, transition probability of success between development phases is also likely to vary between organisations not only for technical reasons but also because of access to finance bottlenecks. It would be a plausible assumption to make that those organisations with previous licensure experience (and marketed vaccines) also have better access to finance, and are therefore, for financial reasons, likely to face higher probability of success in the vaccine research and development programmes (as captured by our high probability of success to high cost scenario).",

Moreover, as experience with Ebola and other recent epidemic infectious disease outbreaks has shown, interest of funders in supporting vaccine research and development in response to outbreaks withers together with the waning of epidemics. Any additional phase 2b\u20133 ready vaccine candidate would not only require an additional multimillion investment just in case, but also a substantial new investment in phase 2b\u20133 testing and emergency response.
