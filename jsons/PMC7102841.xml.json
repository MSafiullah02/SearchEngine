Healthcare-associated transmission of MERS-CoV has been reported in France, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom and has on occasion resulted in large outbreaks [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Secondary transmission has occurred between patients, from patients to healthcare workers, and from patients to visitors of the hospital. To date, there has been limited evidence of transmission documented between healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia [10] and anecdotal evidence from healthcare workers to patients in Saudi Arabia [10]. Because HCW have not been consistently tested for MERS-CoV infection, nor has detailed outbreak investigations occurred within all hospital outbreaks, the role of healthcare workers in onward transmission remains unclear. Given the large number of HCWs infected to date, it is possible that HCW can propagate an outbreak within a healthcare facility. Among reported secondary MERS cases in such outbreaks, a substantial proportion have been healthcare workers [3,4,[9], [10], [11], [12], [13]].",

This is similar to other respiratory pathogens: in the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, 23% of cases in Hong Kong, 40% in Canada and 41% in Singapore were healthcare workers [19]. Protecting health care workers from infectious hazards is paramount to ensuring their safety in delivering health care. In addition, being able to protect healthcare workers, constituting the front line response against high-threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV, is important for reducing secondary transmission in healthcare-associated outbreaks. Reducing infection in healthcare workers, even if their infection does not cause morbidity or mortality, will improve the continuity of care for all patients in the same healthcare facility.",

The decline in risk of death since 2013 may reflect the substantial improvements in surveillance and the infection prevention and control measures that have been introduced in affected countries in recent years. In Saudi Arabia, for example, the Ministry of Health regularly review and update national infection prevention and control guidelines, according to which, healthcare workers who had unprotected \u201chigh-risk exposure\u201d (within 1.5 m of the patient) or have suggestive symptoms regardless of exposure type are required to stop performing their duties immediately; to have a nasopharyngeal swab tested for MERS-CoV; to not resume their duties until cleared by the infection control team and to delay travel until cleared by infection control team [20]. Any healthcare worker who tests positive for MERS, any healthcare worker who develops MERS suggestive symptoms and any healthcare worker who had unprotected high-risk exposure are considered clear and able to resume work if they meet all of the following criteria: asymptomatic for at least 48 h, and the 14-day observation period is over, and they have at least one negative RT-PCR [20].",

Guidelines on contact tracing were revised after 2015 to include the testing of all contacts of confirmed MERS cases (including healthcare workers) for MERS-CoV.

These will be critical to minimizing transmission in healthcare facilities, particularly until interventions are introduced to stop the virus entering the human population from the dromedary camel reservoir.
