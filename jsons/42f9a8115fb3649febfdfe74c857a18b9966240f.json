Particularly interesting is that of 6 secondary patients, two were asymptomatic, one was paucisymptomatic, and three were symptomatic. Our findings show that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by individuals with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infections is possible. Patients 1 and 2 were likely first exposed to SARS-CoV-2 after visiting their hometown in Xiaogan Hubei Province, China. Their son (Patient 3) and daughter-in-law (Patient 4, asymptomatic), whom they live with, were later found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Patient 5 (asymptomatic) was identified to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 after frequent contact with Patients 3 and 4 during work and home visits. She transmitted the virus to her son (symptomatic) whom she lives with. Patient 7 (paucisymptomatic) was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 after frequent contact with Patient 3 during work. He likely transmitted the virus to his daughter (Patient 8, asymptomatic). In addition, consistent with previous studies [5] [6] [7] [8] , the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation period of Patient 3 likely occurred. Patients 5 and 7 were infected after their exposures to a presymptomatic Patient 3 during working or home visits. These findings may help explain the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 between person-to-person.",

Such detection of SARS-CoV-2 in contaminated environments of the household may provide an additional contribution to virus transmission among family members as the virus can remain viable and infectious on the surface up to seven days [15] .

They were self-quarantined at home for 14 days starting on the day of the hospital admission of Patients 1 and 2. Their nasopharyngeal swabs were collected on January 23 for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patient 3 was confirmed positive that same day for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, but had no symptoms. Patient 4 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but was later confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 on January 25 when a repeat pharyngeal swab was collected and tested. Upon hospital admission, Patient 3 developed a slightly dry and itchy throat. The cough was a major symptom during hospitalization, and two days fever and four days fatigue of the total hospital stay was also recorded. Patient 4 had no identified clinical symptoms (Figure 1). Patient 5, a 53-year-old female, lived with her son (Patient 6) and parents, and was a close contact of Patients 3 and 4, being the mother-in-law of Patient 3 and the mother of Patient 4. She was self-quarantined at home beginning the day of Patient 3's confirmation (January 23). On January 24, her nasopharyngeal swab was collected to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was later confirmed positive by rRT-PCR, despite her lack of symptoms. She also did not show any clinical symptoms of infection during hospitalization(Figure 1). Patient 6, a 28-year-old male, was identified as the close contact of his mother (Patient 5). He was self-quarantined at home beginning the day of his mother's (Patient 5) confirmed infection (January 24). His nasopharyngeal swab was collected on January 25 and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive by rRT-PCR. On admission in the afternoon on January 25, he developed a fever (37.5\u00b0C). Major symptoms during hospitalization included fever and cough, and the symptoms persisted more than two weeks. Patient 7, a 35-year-old man, lived with his wife and three children, and was identified as the close contact of Patient 3. He was self-quarantined at home beginning the day of Patient 3's confirmed infection (January 23). On January 25, his nasopharyngeal swab was collected and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. During hospitalization, he was paucisymptomatic, with only an occasional cough. Patient 8, a 3-month-old female infant, was the close contact of Patient 7, her father.

Patient 5 also visited the home of Patients 1-4 on the evening of January 21 and stayed one night. On the morning of January 22, Patient 5 was driven home by Patient 3. During these contacts, no facemasks or other PPE were used. Patient 6 did not report close contact with known COVID-19 cases except for his mother. Patient 7 reported that he had a frequency of 2 to 3 times daily contact with Patient 3 at the factory from January 15 to 18 and dined with Patient 3 and other colleagues on January 18.

A total of 15 (5 per household) surface swab samples were collected from the bedrooms (n=9, three per household), kitchens (n=3, one per household), and bathrooms (n=3, one per household) of patient homes. Two (13.3%) of 15 swabs (one from the bedroom of Patient 3 and another one from his family kitchen) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. The full-genome sequences for eight patients were obtained and have been deposited in GISAID (accession numbers EPI_ISL_414934-414941). The full-genome for the two environmental swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 were not obtained due to low-coverage genomes. The full-genomes of eight patients were >99.9% identical across the whole genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the viruses from patients were clustered in the same clade and were genetically similar to other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China and other countries (Figure 2). No significant mutation site was identified in the eight SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences compared with previous strains in China and other countries. Close contacts Fifteen contacts of either Patient 1 or Patient 2 were identified, and two contacts (Patients 3 and 4) were confirmed with COVID-19. A total of 88 contacts of Patient 3 were identified, and two contacts (Patients 5 and 7) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Seventy-three close contacts of Patient 5 were identified, and one contact (Patient 6) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Two contacts were identified for Patient 6 and all tested negative. Twenty-one contacts of Patient 7 were identified and one contact (Patient 8) tested positive. Of 101 close contacts identified for Patient 8, all tested negative. No other close contacts of the patients were identified during the 14-day follow-up.
