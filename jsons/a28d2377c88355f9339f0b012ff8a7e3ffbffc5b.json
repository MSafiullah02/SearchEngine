The risk factors for severe presentations are concentrated in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are dialysis dependent. We report the first US case of a 56-year-old nondiabetic male with ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy undergoing thrice-weekly maintenance hemodialysis for 3 years, who developed COVID-19 infection. He has hypertension controlled with angiotensin receptor blocker losartan 100 mg/day and coronary artery disease status-post stent placement. During the first 5 days of his febrile disease, he presented to an urgent care, 3 emergency rooms, 1 cardiology clinic, and 2 dialysis centers in California and Utah. During this interval, he reported nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and low-grade fevers but was not suspected of COVID-19 infection until he developed respiratory symptoms and was admitted to the hospital. Imaging studies upon admission were consistent with bilateral interstitial pneumonia. He was placed in droplet-eye precautions while awaiting COVID-19 test results. Within the first 24 h, he deteriorated quickly and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation and increasing respiratory support. Losartan was withheld due to hypotension and septic shock. COVID-19 was reported positive on hospital day 3. He remained in critical condition being treated with hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in addition to the standard medical management for septic shock and ARDS. Our case is unique in its atypical initial presentation and highlights the importance of early testing.",

There is likely an immunologic explanation, given our current understanding of weakened immune system in diabetics and individuals with advanced age.

He was initiated on antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Over the next 24 h, he was febrile to 101\u00b0F and respiratory status rapidly deteriorated. His repeat chest X-rays demonstrated evolution of the bilateral multifocal opacities consistent with the atypical pneumonia, and there was concern for superimposed pulmonary edema. He underwent dialysis the evening of hospital day 2; he tolerated the treatment poorly, developing new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate despite only minimal ultrafiltration. His respiratory condition continued to rapidly decline during the night, and he had to be intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and shock. His pulmonary condition continued to deteriorate to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring continued mechanical ventilation with high PEEP > 10 cm and FiO 2 > 60% as well as pressor support. In an effort to maintain close control of his volume status and metabolic parameters, we have initiated him on continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. In the setting of ESRD, he has been deemed not a candidate for remdesivir compassionate use trial and was started on hydroxychloroquine and on hospital day 6 he was started on tocilizumab given continued hemodynamic instability with elevated inflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-6. With the inability to rule out superimposed infection he has also been on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactom since hospital day 6. His clinical course is being followed closely by a multispecialist team, and depending on his trajectory, he may require paralysis as well as more aggressive pulmonary and hemodynamic support with proning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

[8] , clinical characteristics of 21 patients including 2 long-term dialysis admitted to an ICU in Washington State were described. A unique feature of our reported case is the potentially long incubation period, assuming this patient contracted the infection in South Korea in early January 2020, which was 6 weeks prior to the first presentation, but we cannot be certain. Alternatively he could be one of the first community spread cases identified in southern California. The delayed diagnosis for the first 5 days was likely because it was not recognized by the treating centers that gastrointestinal manifestation may be a part of COVID-19 infection. Our reported dialysis-dependent patient is notably healthier and younger than the average dialysis patients in the United States and without diabetes but with a history of hypertension and cardiac disease. Yet, he developed ARDS and has required ventilatory support. This case report highlights the importance of considering COVID-19 infection in a variety of clinical presentation that may not initially include typical respiratory symptom to prevent ongoing exposure of potentially affected individuals to the general population. It also highlights the need for rapidly available testing for all patients who present to healthcare setting with even nonsevere and atypical symptoms. This patient with community spread disease traveled from Southern California to Utah for 2 days using public airports, commercial flights, and public transportation, potential exposures which could have been avoided if testing supplies and public health recommendations would have been different. The consequences of this exposure remain unclear, but the United States has since had a rapidly increasing number of cases.",

In a recent report from Hubei, China, 204 COVID-19-infected patients were studied, and the authors reported that digestive symptoms are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19 [10] . Patients who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms had a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Hence, clinicians including nephrologists should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, may be among the presenting features of COVID-19 infection, and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms [10] .",

The mortality rate is cur- rently estimated to be between 10 and 30 times as lethal as influenza, though as the incidence of the disease rises this may change [5] . This pandemic has resulted in a massive effort worldwide to quarantine suspected individuals and isolate the affected patients, unparalleled in modern history. The plan to \"flatten the curve\" is presumed only way our health system is expected to cope with the crisis by reducing demand for hospital and ICU beds [11] . The reason for higher incidence and mortality of CO-VID-19 infection in individuals with several comorbidities including cardiovascular disease is still unknown [7] . Prior studies suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding capacity is strongly associated with coronavirus infectivity and disease severity. ACE2 may be differentially upregulated by ACEi, ARB, and aldosterone antagonists [12] [13] [14] . It is postulated that the expression of ACE2 may be increased with the use of ACEi, ARB, and aldosterone antagonists, particularly in diabetic patients, and therefore it has been suggested that increased expression of ACE2 may facilitate infection by COVID-19. It is important to note, however, that higher ACE2 levels have been shown to have a protective effect against acute lung injury and reduce progression of lung injury to ARDS in animal studies. As a result, there are ongoing investigations for ACE2 as potential new therapy for inflammatory lung disease [15] . ACE2 has been noted to decrease with age, and COVID-19 has consistently demonstrated higher mortality and morbidity in the older population. Figure 2 shows the pathophysiological interplay between viral entry and lung physiology centered around ACE2.",

These antimalarial agents have shown potent antiviral activity in vitro, especially hydroxychloroquine [16] . Lopinavir-ritonavir is also being used clinically [17] ; however, whereas an emerging agent for COVID-19 infection is remdesivir [18] , unfortunately patients with ESRD are excluded from current trials. Toculizumab is an antagonist of the IL-6 receptor an agent that has been used to treat cytokine-release syndrome a severe but anticipated toxicity with CAR-T-cell therapy in different malignancies. Similarly in severe infections with hyperinflammation immunosuppression may improve survival, and there are preliminary reports from China regarding patients with elevated IL-6 levels and COVID-19 pneumonia. Given clinical deterioration in our patient and concern for hyperinflammation with elevated IL-6 levels, we have started tocliziumab.",

Vaccine development is anticipated but may take time and if successful will help establish herd immunity to protect the noninfected population at large. As the scientific and medical community faces the unknown surge of COVID-19, some of our most vulnerable populations are already gathered for routine treatments in limited space; for example, infusion centers and dialysis centers placing them at great risk for exposure. The importance of rapid use of clinical publication data is paramount to making progress and spreading innovation. We have reported one of the first patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis with COVID-19 infection. This scenario presents various epidemiological challenges as far as containing infectious spread in a dialysis unit. This scenario also suggests that home dialysis maybe a protective intervention in the face of such a rapidly infectious pandemic.",
