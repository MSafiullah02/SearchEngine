In neonatal lambs, the prepatent period lasts for approximately 5 days, and clinical symptoms are apparent for between 5 days and 2 weeks. The prominent symptom is mild-to-severe diarrhoea, but other clinical signs include depression, anorexia and abdominal pain. Large numbers of oocysts (108\u20131010\n oocysts/g) are present in the diarrhoeatic stool. The weight losses and mortality (up to 40%) associated with the disease may induce important economic losses for farmers (Naciri et al., 1984, Yvor\u00e9 et al., 1984).",

Specific molecules on the surface of both epithelial cells and C. parvum sporozoites are involved in the infection process. The presence of a C. parvum sporozoite surface lectin specific to galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal-GalNAc), and which may mediate attachment of sporozoites to host cells, has been demonstrated (Chen and LaRusso, 1999). The many drugs tested to date, such as halofuginone lactate, paromomycin and cyclodextrins (Mancassola et al., 1995, Chartier et al., 1996, Chartier et al., 1999, Viu et al., 2000, Castro-Hermida et al., 2001, Castro-Hermida et al., 2004) have shown only partial effectiveness in the treatment and prophylaxis of cryptosporidiosis in neonatal lambs and goat kids. Moreover, cryptosporidiosis is difficult to control because of the resistance of the oocysts to environmental conditions and to disinfectants, including sodium hypochlorite, ammonia, chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde (Korich et al., 1990, Castro-Hermida et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Infection by C. parvum has been demonstrated to increase concentrations of tissue prostaglandins in pigs, calves and humans (Argenzio et al., 1990, Laurent et al., 1998, Cole et al., 2003). Prostaglandins, which are produced as an integral part of the inflammatory response to infection, inhibit sodium absorption, and their blockade with the non-specific cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin restores sodium absorption to normal levels (Argenzio et al., 1996). Bobel-24 (2,4,6-triiodophenol), a drug obtained by chemical synthesis, has been shown to be potentially active as an anti-inflammatory agent, and has an action similar to or superior than that of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Parre\u00f1o et al., 2006, Troc\u00f3niz et al., 2006). Some interesting properties of phenolic compounds have been described in relation to their structure. It has been found that Bobel-24 is a dual inhibitor of lipooxygenase and cyclooxygenase, which may be important in the treatment of anti-inflammatory diseases (L\u00f3pez-Belmonte and Norton, 1997, L\u00f3pez-Belmonte and Norton, 1999, Garc\u00eda-Capdevila et al., 1998, Parre\u00f1o et al., 2006). Moreover, it has been shown that Bobel-24 is an inhibitor of l-selectine expression; this molecule is crucial for the attachment of Cryptosporidium sporozoites to epithelial cells (Chen and LaRusso, 2000, Rueda et al., 2008). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antiparasitic activity of Bobel-24 against C. parvum infection in neonatal lambs.",

            "text": "Attachment of sporozoites to epithelial cells and invasion of the cell membrane are crucial steps in the pathogenesis of cryptosporidiosis. Galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNAc) epitopes of glycoproteins on the epithelial apical membrane and Gal/GalNAc-specific sporozoite surface lectins are involved in this mechanism(s). Previous studies have shown that in vitro incubation of C. parvum sporozoites with Gal/GalNAc and bovine mucin reduces C. parvum attachment to biliary and intestinal epithelia by up to 70%. Preincubation of cell monolayers with either lectins specific to Gal/GalNAc, or glycosidases that specifically release Gal/GalNAc oligosaccharides from glycoproteins, decreased attachment by up to 80% (Chen and LaRusso, 2000). This may be why Bobel-24 was able to inhibit up to 99.6% of the infection of HCT-8 cells by Cryptosporidium sporozoites (Rueda et al., 2008). In the present study, Bobel-24 was not able to completely prevent infection by C. parvum in neonatal lambs. However, oocyst shedding, patent period and diarrhoea were notably reduced after administration of a prophylactic/therapeutic treatment (Bobel-24 at 50 mg/kg). Similar results were obtained by Rueda et al. (2008) with an in vivo model of chronic cryptosporidiosis (SCID mouse). C. parvum infection increases the concentrations of tissue prostaglandins (by up to 50% of baseline levels) in both pigs and humans (Argenzio et al., 1990, Laurent et al., 1998) and diarrhoea has been partially attributed to the local production of prostanoid (Argenzio et al., 1993, Argenzio et al., 1996). Bobel-24 (2,4,6-triiodophenol) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The reduction in the inflammation associated with the parasite infection may account for the antidiarrhoeic effects observed in this study. A global reduction in the level of oocyst excretion was observed, which may be the result of an anti-cryptosporidial effect of the drug, as demonstrated in vitro by Rueda et al. (2008). Nevertheless, it is possible that in the present study the decrease in the level of excretion was due to the reduced levels of diarrhoea.",
