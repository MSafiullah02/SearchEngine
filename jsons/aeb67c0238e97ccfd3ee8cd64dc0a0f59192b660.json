We compare the e-contest with the 10 previous editions of the same, but face-to-face contest. While apparently the competition did not suffer because of being a virtual one, some disadvantages were noted. The main conclusions are: the basic interconnectivity means arise no serious technical issue, but the jury-jury interconnectivity is more limited than the face-to-face one; online jury-competitors interactivity is poorer than face-to-face interactivity; human factors, higher uncertainties in the organization process, and less time to spend in the process for the local organizers are major limiting factors; concerns on the participation and evaluation fairness are higher; involuntary gender discrimination seems lower, but persists; there are serious concerns related to privacy, including differential privacy; some peculiarities of the presented topics and of the evaluation process emerged, but it is unclear if they are related to the online nature of the competition, to the extra stress on the particiapants during the pandemic, or to other factors, or are random. While some conclusions may be intimately related to the analyzed case, some are general enough for being worth to other online competitions and examinations.",

INTRODUCTION Numerous studies have been recently devoted to the need of and requirements for online learning under the conditions created by the current pandemic [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, no such study was published on extra-curricular activities, such as student competitions. The topic becomes more important as several countries plan online national-wide examinations (A-levels, GCSEs) and vocational qualifications, and universities struggle to find methods of replacing various types of examinations, including graduating examinations with online ones or surrogates, such as 'prediction of results' in UK and Ireland [7] or with other \"grades issued this summer by the relevant recognised authority\" as Oxford University vaguely describes [8] .",

Based on incomplete personal archive III. INSURING THE QUALITY OF THE PROJECT EVALUATION PROCESS: ACADEMIA-INDUSTRY JURY The uniformity of grading was a serious concern because of the inherently limited interactivity of the jury with the teams, offline, because of the lack of hands-on interaction of the jury with the presented projects, and because of the limited or null interactivity of the members of the jury during the presentations -unlike face-to-face competitions.

In principle, there should be no relationship between the spreading and the average of the grades of the teams. The average grade per contest was 8.22 and the STDEV of all grades was 0.68. The average of the STDEV of the individual grades given by the jury members, for all the teams was 0.52, which shows a reasonable uniformity in the grading, only slightly larger than the random choice between successive grades (which is 0.5).",

The slope of the regression is negative (-0.16) meaning that for every extra point in the grade, the precision of the grade is 0.16 point better (R 2 =0.115). There are three 'outlier' grades, with zero standard deviations. If the two outliers are removed, the slope becomes -0.2 and the coefficient of determination of the linear regression is even higher (R 2 =0.29), Fig. 3 . This result call into question the grading process improvement, with more time spent with those teams less convincing. The practice of online classes, examinations [12] , and of the reported contest indicate that, despite the technical progresses, the platforms for audio-video interaction over the Internet offer a much more limited degree of freedom in the interaction. The difficulties of fast and easily zooming in and out during practical demonstrations and of fast, eye-blink change of the direction of view were evident from the student presentations. The inability for the jury Spreading vs. average grade, after removing the cases with STDEV=0 members to privately or semi-privately consult and discuss with each other, as in a face-to-face conversation, without disturbing the other members of the jury or stopping the presentation is annoying in online interactions and limits the efficiency of the evaluation process. The good, yet limited quality of the online pictures was challenging when details of the devices were needed. Overall, the online paralinguistic communication is still poor and at time frustrating in the educational process, including in the online competitions. Unfortunately, these issues cannot be solved before the summer and autumn examinations planned in 2020, under the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.",

Fairness in grading and prize allocation is always an issue when students are enrolled in different study years. Among the many possible approaches to fairness, in all the eleven editions of this contest, the study-year blind approach was used. This fairness criterion is considered, in fact, unfair. Small adjustments have been made, including this year, by offering a honorable mention diploma to the youngest participant(s).

The indices may inform project advisors on the need to be more innovative and on the trends in the interests of the students. The most frequent words (Fig. 5) indicate that participants emphasized on the complexity of the projects (using the words \"system\" and \"intelligent\") and addressed mainly monitoring (\"monitorizare\") and control applications, followed by energy conversion. The rank-frequency distribution of words, after removing the stop-words (which is not usually done in this kind of analysis), does not follow Zipf's law, but this may be due to the very low number of cases in the statistic. A fact that is surprising is that 6 of the first 7 projects had a longer title than the average, see Fig. 7 . The linear regression of number of letters in the title vs. grade has a positive slope and the coefficient of determination is 0.187. This may be due to the greater care for details in the best projects, or may be a random occurrence. This is however not a rule valid for former editions of the competition, for example in 2018 the first prize was won by a project with title composed of only 29 letters, the second had 33 letters, and the third 25 letters (see [12] ). On the other hand, there were long titles in previous competitions too, but they were less frequent. (Examples of longer titles in 2012-2018 competitions are 'Sistem embedded auto de comanda si control a ferestrelor cu protectia utilizatorului si a sistemului electric', with 16 words and 94 characters, 'Robot inteligent care detecteaza succesiuni de marcaje \u0219i \u00eendeplineste task-uri, simul\u00e2nd un ora\u0219 inteligent' with 14 words and 95 characters,and 'Detectie culoare /obiect prin intermediul microcontrolerului folosind mediul de programare Matlab', with 11 words and 87 characters.)

For example, the competition organizers have no means to control that the participants do not take pictures and to enforce several of the competition rules.

Because firms bestow their own prizes, the specific firm prize winning competitor easily derives that the firm representative in the jury gave her a large grade, while the other firm representatives have not conferred the largest possible grade. Thus, the competitors gain some very specific information at least on some of the members of the jury. When a competitor gets two firm awards out of the possible few, but does not win any general prize of the competition (for which the academic members of the jury have a vote), information on the vote of the professors is obtained. That information, in turn, may influence the grading of a professor by the respective student. To remove this and fairness concerns, the academic members of the jury should not be allowed to vote for students from their university. Also, it is advisable that the prizes offered by the firms are proposed as sets of choices by the firm representatives and decided with the vote of the academic members of the jury. This would reduce the information gained from the firm prizes.",

However, it was apparent that online jury-competitors interactivity is poorer than face-to-face interactivity and may have created some frustrations on both sides. The main issues are related to human factors, to higher uncertainties in the organization process, and to much shorter time to spend in the process by the people in the local organizing team. There are several issues specific to the online contest, including concerns on the lower degree of fairness in the participation and evaluation, and serious concerns related to privacy. The analysis of the evaluation process and of the topics of the presentations revealed some unexpected peculiarities, but it is not clear if these are due to the online nature of the competition, to other factors, or are random variations.",
