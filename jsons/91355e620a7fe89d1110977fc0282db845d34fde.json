The four species of Plasmodium known to cause malaria in humans are P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax. Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent of these species and is responsible for most cases of malaria infections and malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Plasmodium vivax, the second most common species of the malaria parasite, is more prevalent in Asia and is rarely associated with acute complications of malaria or fatality. Box 12.1 presents definitions of some of the most commonly used terms in malaria epidemiology. Figure 12 .1 shows the global distribution of malaria transmission risk. Malaria transmission occurs in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, but sub-Saharan Africa bears over 80% of the global burden of malaria mortality (Ehiri et al. 2004) . Malaria is still a major public health problem in parts of Southeast Asia with foci of high P. falciparum transmission and high incidence of multidrug resistance.",

In the human, the sporozoites enter liver cells Malaria transmission can be perennial (occurring throughout the year), high, intense, and/or stable, low, unstable, and seasonal. High stable transmission of mostly P. falciparum associated with high incidence of severe illness and mortality among preschool children is the predominant pattern of malaria in most of sub-Saharan Africa. The average malaria incidence rates across several parts of Africa with high transmission are estimated at 1.4 per persons per year, 0.59 per persons per year, and 0.11 persons per year for age groups <5 years, 5-14 years, and !15 years, respectively (Snow et al. 2003) . In low transmission areas, incidence rates of malaria are much lower, and differ only marginally between the young and older age groups. Malaria epidemics are more likely to occur in areas with seasonal and unstable transmission. Figure 12 .3 illustrates the various pathways by which malaria contributes to poverty, under-development, malnutrition, and maternal and infant mortality. Some 300-500 million malaria episodes occur annually. Children under 5 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa and women who are pregnant for the first or second time bear the heaviest burden of malaria morbidity and mortality. An estimated 250 million episodes of clinical malaria occur in young sub-Saharan African children annually. About 1 million cases are cerebral malaria, 4 million cases are severe anemia, and approximately 1 million result in death. Estimates of malaria mortality show wide variation. A review of the literature on this subject shows that the number of deaths due to malaria in African children aged less than 5 years where they develop into the next stage of the malaria parasite life cycle (the liver stage or exoerythrocytic stage).",

In malaria-endemic countries of Africa, up to 40% of all outpatient clinic visits and between 20 and 50% of all hospital admissions are due to malaria (WHO 2003) . Although the incidence of uncomplicated malaria is lower in adolescents aged 10-19 years than younger school aged and preschool children, the burden of malaria in this age group could be substantial in areas with high and stable transmission. A recent review of the epidemiology and pattern of malaria in adolescents estimates the clinical malaria rate in African adolescents aged 10-20 years to be 0.252 attacks per adolescent per year (Lalloo et al. 2006) . Results of analyses based on rainfall and temperature data and geographic information system (GIS) population databases in areas with high and stable malaria transmission put the yearly estimate of the number of malaria attacks in children aged 0-4 years, 5-9 years, and 10-14 years at 81.3 million, 16.0 million, and 13.4 million, respectively.",

            "text": "The clinical pattern and deleterious consequences of malaria infection vary, depending on the level of acquired malaria immunity of the individual and the pattern of malaria transmission in an area. In areas with high and stable malaria transmission, resident adults and older children acquire sufficient partial immunity to reduce the risk of severe and fatal malaria but younger children and pregnant women remain vulnerable to severe and complicated malaria. Malaria infection may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. The majority of malaria infections in areas where transmission is high and stable are asymptomatic. Even when malaria infection is asymptomatic, it is believed that the high prevalence of low parasitemic and asymptomatic malaria infections contribute to the high prevalence of mild and moderate childhood anemia. In these settings, young children who are less immune to the disease are more likely to have clinical malaria following infections. The common symptoms of uncomplicated malaria are fever, poor appetite, aches, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. Uncomplicated malaria is the most common reason for which children and adults use the health service in sub-Saharan Africa. Uncomplicated malaria accounts for about 40 and 30% of outpatient attendance and hospital admissions, respectively. Malaria is also a leading cause of absenteeism and poor performance at work and school. Uncomplicated malaria is rarely fatal when treated promptly with effective antimalarial drugs. In preschool children, delayed treatment or failure to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria could lead to rapid disease progression to severe and potentially fatal malaria within a period often less than 48 h from onset of illness. Plasmodium falciparum causes severe malaria through complex processes that involve immunological substances known as cytokines (John et al. 2000) leading to impaired perfusion and damage to tissues and organs. These pathological changes lead to clinical and laboratory features that are characteristic of severe and complicated malaria, namely cerebral malaria that is associated with impaired consciousness, repeated convulsions, severe malarial anemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and circulatory collapse. Children that die from malaria would have one or more of these signs. The risk of death is higher in patients with multiple signs (Schellenberg et al. 1999) . Case fatality rate of complicated falciparum malaria is 10-50%. About 10-17% of those that survive cerebral malaria have residual neurological problems such as dyskinesia, cortical blindness, seizures, and learning disorders (Meremikwu et al.1997 ). Most of these disorders are resolved within 6 months but about 2% persist for longer periods of time causing varying degrees of disability and impaired intellectual development (Murphy and Breman 2001) .",

In areas with high transmission, malaria is the leading etiological factor for anemia. The processes by which malaria causes anemia are not yet fully understood; however, malaria-related toxins and immunological factors are believed to cause increased hemolysis, increased splenic clearance of infected and uninfected red blood cells, and impaired production of red blood cells in the bone marrow (dyserythropoeisis). In areas of Africa with high malaria transmission, surveys have shown high prevalence rates of anemia (hemoglobin <11 g/dL) among infants and children under 5 years of age (as high as 50-80% in several areas). Most of these cases of anemia go unnoticed and untreated because they are mild and cause no symptoms. Although children with mild and chronic anemia do not feel distinct symptoms of illness, mild anemia is associated with chronic debility. It can cause such adverse effects as reduced activity and impaired cognition and learning. These chronic effects of malarial anemia in concert with malaria-related school absenteeism and neurological complications from cerebral malaria, adversely affect childhood development and education in sub-Saharan Africa (Mung'Ala- Odera et al. 2004) .",

It is responsible for high case fatality and often follows massive hemolysis from a single episode of falciparum malaria. Repeated episodes or poorly treated episodes of uncomplicated malaria are fairly common pathways to severe anemia in infants and young children who are residents of areas with high and stable malaria transmission. In many communities in Africa where there are high levels of P. falciparum resistance to chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, the continued use of failed drugs has resulted in an increase in the incidence of severe malarial anemia. Case fatality from severe malarial anemia varies from 1% in treated cases to over 30% when associated with other complications of falciparum malaria, especially respiratory distress and deep coma (John et al. 2000) . Many more children with life-threatening severe malaria anemia do not have access to formal health care where adequate treatment and blood transfusion are possible. This indicates that overall case fatality from severe malarial anemia is likely to be much higher than reported. Blood transfusion for severe malaria-related anemia accounts for a remarkable proportion of new pediatric HIV infections in Africa (Crawley and Nahlen 2004) .",

For instance, mass de-worming of children and micronutrient supplementation programs are interventions that have the potential to reduce the burden of childhood anemia in developing countries (Briand et al. 2007 ). Insecticide-treated nets, chemoprophylaxis, and intermittent preventive treatment are malariaspecific interventions that have been shown to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria-related anemia (Briand et al. 2007 ). Malaria is a leading cause of hemolytic and vasoocclusive crisis in African children and adolescents with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited hematological disease among Africans. The prevalence of the sickle cell trait (heterozygous inheritance on an abnormal and a normal gene) can be as high as 25-40% in some parts of Africa with 1-3% affected by the disorder (inheritance of a pair of abnormal gene). A paradoxical relationship exists between the sickle cell gene and malaria. The sickle gene is believed to confer some measure of protection against malaria to those with the trait (one abnormal gene); however, it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among those with the disorder (two abnormal genes).",

There are no reliable data on the magnitude of renal morbidity which are caused by this malaria-induced pathology. However, it is believed that the problem is substantial. Hyperactive malarial splenomegaly (also called tropical splenomegaly syndrome) is another chronic, but less common presentation of malaria among children and adolescents in the tropics.

Plasmodium falciparum exerts the worst effects among all the species of malaria parasite. In sub-Saharan Africa, the transmission of P. falciparum is predominantly high and intense with high levels of morbidity and mortality among infants and pregnant women. The major consequences of malaria infection during pregnancy are clinical episodes of malaria, maternal anemia (hemoglobin concentration <11 g/dL), or severe anemia (hemoglobin concentration <8 g/dL), placental parasitemia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm births, and low birth weight. Table 12 .1 shows the contribution of malaria to adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Malaria in pregnancy is estimated to account for up to 25% of cases of severe anemia, 10-20% of babies born with low birth weight, and 5-10% of neonatal and infant deaths are due to malariainduced LBW (Greenwood et al. 2005) . The effect of malaria in pregnancy is influenced by the level of malaria immunity acquired by the mother before pregnancy. This depends on the pattern and intensity of malaria transmission. The parasite species, the number of previous pregnancies, and the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) also remarkably impact malaria morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. In areas with high and stable malaria transmission, the prevalence and intensity of P. falciparum parasitemia are higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. The majority of malaria infections in pregnant women living in high transmission areas are asymptomatic because of immunity acquired from repeated exposure to malaria before pregnancy. The adverse consequences of malaria during pregnancy in areas of high transmission are anemia, placental malaria, intrauterine growth retardation, and low birth weight. In areas of low or unstable transmission, acquired malaria immunity is low in all age groups. Pregnant women with malaria in this area are vulnerable to severe manifestation of the disease including cerebral malaria.",

Impact of the complex interaction between malaria and HIV appears to be most profound in pregnancy and children. HIV infection in pregnancy is known to increase the risk of malaria infection (population attributable risk (PAR), 10-27%), maternal anemia (PAR, 12-15%), and low birth weight (PAR, 11-38%) (Steketee et al. 2001) . The mechanism by which HIV infection alters malaria morbidity is not well understood. It is believed to be due to systemic and placental immunologic changes that are induced by HIV. In a Rwandan cohort study that included 228 HIV-positive and 229 HIV-negative participants, the incidence of malaria was almost twice as high in the HIV-positive group (6.2 per 100 women-months) than in the HIV-negative group (3.5 per 100 women-months) (Ladner et al. 2002) . A review of studies on malaria and HIV coinfection shows that HIV infection in pregnancy significantly increases the risk of peripheral and placental malaria parasitemia. Malaria in pregnant women infected by HIV is more likely to cause higher parasite densities, febrile illness, severe anemia, and low birth weight than malaria in those without HIV infection (Snow et al. 2003) . In the absence of HIV infection, the deleterious effects of malaria in pregnancy, notably low birth weight and maternal anemia, were significantly worse in those pregnant for the first or second time than in those who have been pregnant for three or more times (Ter Kuile et al. 2004 ). With HIV co-infection, the pattern of malaria morbidity is similar across all categories of pregnant women (Ter Kuile et al. 2004) .",

However, this was not the case in women with more than four previous pregnancies (Gamble et al. 2006) .

The emergence and spread of malaria parasites (especially P. falciparum) resistant to the commonly used affordable antimalarials, like chloroquine (CQ) and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), hampered malaria control in Africa and has deteriorated the malaria situation on the continent. The emergence of these multidrug-resistant malaria parasites led to the adoption of combination treatment options as the gold standards for treating malaria. The WHO (2006) recommends that the ideal drug combination should contain two drugs that are individually effective against the blood stages of the parasite and use completely different mechanisms to kill the parasite. Based on results from several well-conducted studies, the WHO recommended that combinations that contain artemisinin (a drug derived from the Chinese plant A. annua L.) or its derivatives and another structurally unrelated and more slowly acting drug provide the best therapeutic effects and are safe. This category of drug combinations is collectively known as artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs).",

If the partner drug is effective, ACTs ensure prompt recovery and high cure rates. They are generally well tolerated. Replacing the older failing or failed monotherapies with effective drugs will reduce morbidity and mortality. The challenge, however, remains how to deliver these drugs to the people that need them. Implementation of this policy would put significant cost burdens on national malaria control programs. However, the costs of failing to change, such as an increase in childhood deaths and high cost of hospitalization, make it a necessary and cost-effective program.",

ACTs are generally too expensive for most people in low-income settings where malaria is endemic. While drugs such as chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), which were previously used for treating uncomplicated malaria, cost only a few US cents, the new ACTs cost about $2-$3.5 and even higher when not discounted. International efforts to address this issue championed by the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partnership have yielded some positive results, especially through the Global Fund for Tuberculosis, AIDS and Malaria (Brundtland 2002) . However, huge gaps still exist. Unfortunately access to prompt treatment with effective antimalarial drugs remains very low in many sub-Saharan countries, leading to the persistence of high malaria mortality rates. The reasons for poor access to treatment are mainly due to weak health systems that are poorly patronized by the populace and a lack of funds to procure and effectively deliver expensive artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACTs). ACTs are necessary since high levels of P. falciparum resistance have rendered chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ineffective. These were the cheaper treatment options that have been used for several decades. Most children who become ill with malaria in these areas are usually treated at home with poor quality or inappropriately administered medicines that were purchased from local, often untrained drug vendors.",

One of the key challenges with implementation of IPT is the high rate of parasite resistance to SP, and the lack of a safe and effective alternative to this antimalarial. In most parts of Africa SP failure exceeds 20% and surveillance data on the trends are lacking in most cases. The effectiveness of this intervention in areas with high SP failure rates is yet to be adequately studied. The suggestion that two and three doses of SP, respectively, should be used in areas with SP resistance <30 and 30-50% remains to be validated by robust research data.

In malaria-endemic communities, use of antimalarial drugs for prophylaxis or intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) is recommended for only pregnant women and special vulnerable groups such as children with sickle cell disease. Several randomized controlled trials in malariaendemic communities have shown consistently that malaria prophylaxis and intermittent preventive treatment of infants (IPTi) and young children are effective. A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis (Meremikwu et al. 2005) showed that receiving antimalarial drugs as prophylaxis or intermittent treatment reduced the incidence of clinical malaria episodes and severe anemia by about 50% in preschool children living in malaria-endemic communities. Two main reasons are commonly given for discouraging widespread use of malaria chemoprophylaxis in preschool children in endemic communities. The first reason is the concern that giving malaria prophylaxis to infants and young children living in malaria-endemic areas will delay or minimize their chances to acquire protective immunity and result in a rebound rise in the incidence of severe morbidity and mortality later in life.",

Developing vaccines against parasitic infections poses greater challenges than developing vaccines for virus and bacterial infections because of their more complex nature and larger genomes. The multiple stages of the malaria parasite and the different proteins they express pose additional challenges to the development of a potent malaria vaccine. An allstage malaria vaccine capable of inhibiting growth or killing all of these different stages of malaria poses a complex challenge. Researchers involved in development of malaria vaccine devote their efforts to three key strategies that target the preerythrocytic and erythrocytic stages of the life cycle in humans (Fig. 12. 2), and vaccines that induce antibodies in humans that can kill or prevent development of viable sexual forms ingested by the mosquito vectors. The pre-erythrocytic stage vaccines aim to prevent sporozoites (the stage of plasmodium that mosquitoes pass to humans) from invading and developing in the liver, while an asexual erythrocytic stage vaccine limits the invasion of erythrocytes or prevents their multiplication in the erythrocytes.",

The goal of most of the initial efforts of malaria vaccine development is complete prevention of the disease with the hope of eliminating malaria. The disappointing results of early malaria vaccine trials appear to have diminished this enthusiasm. Should efforts to develop a malaria vaccine capable of completely preventing clinical malaria fail, most public health experts and vaccine researchers advocate the goal of making malaria vaccines that ameliorate the severity of the disease and reduce the level of fatality. In Africa, where pregnant women and children bear the greatest burden of severe malaria, such a vaccine will be a significant addition to maternal and child health services and will help to reduce the burden of childhood disability attributable to cerebral malaria. The opportunities provided by better research tools and a better understanding of the Plasmodium and Anopheles genome make the prospects and possibilities of a malaria vaccine better today than ever before. Funding for malaria vaccine development and field trials has increased in recent years. However, it is still far short of the expected investment, given its huge potential for improving child survival and contributing to achievement of the millennium development goals (MDG).",

There is consensus that the four technical elements of the global malaria control strategy (Box 12.4) affirmed by the international ministerial conference held in Amsterdam under the auspices of the World Health Organization in 1992 have been essentially effective in the years preceding and succeeding the Amsterdam conference.",

Insecticidetreated nets are cost-effective, but endemic poverty and inadequate sensitization of people in malariaendemic areas remain the major reasons for low use (Snow et al. 2003) . The cost-effectiveness of ITNs (US $19-85 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY)) is similar to most childhood vaccines (WHO 2003) . When community coverage is high, ITNs not only protect those who sleep under them, but also those in the same dwelling (the home effect) and those living nearby (the community effect) (Snow et al. 2003) .",

Key: (A) Mosquito infected with the malaria parasite bites human, passing cells called sporozoites into the human's bloodstream. (B) Sporozoites travel to the liver. Each sporozoite undergoes asexual reproduction, in which its nucleus splits to form two new cells called merozoites. (C) Merozoites enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells. (D) In red blood cells, merozoites grow and divide to produce more merozoites, eventually causing the red blood cells to rupture. Some of the newly released merozoites go on to infect other red blood cells. (E) Some merozoites develop into sex cells known as male and female gametocytes. (F) Another mosquito bites the infected human, ingesting the gametocytes. (G) In the mosquito's stomach, the gametocytes mature. Male and female gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction, uniting to form a zygote. The zygote multiplies to form sporozoites, which travel to the mosquito's salivary glands. (H) If this mosquito bites another human, the cycle begins again. Source: Microsoft Encarta (2008), http://encarta.msn.com/media_461541582_761566151_-1_1/life_cycle_of_the_malaria_parasite.html",
