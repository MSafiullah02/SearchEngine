After processing of antigen by the antigen presenting cells, the peptide fragments are presented along with major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules to CD4+ T cells or with MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells to generate efficient T-cell responses. The antigen presenting cells also provide additional co-stimulatory stimulus (e.g., ligation of B7.1 or CD80 on antigen-presenting cells with CD28 on T cells) to lower the threshold of T-cell activation and survival following the recognition of antigens. The ligation of TLRs on antigen presenting cells enhances the phagocytosis of the pathogen through the release of chemokines and other peptides, which then result in activation and recruitment of immune cells to the sites of infection.",

            "text": "Phagocytosis involves the engulfment and lysis and/or digestion of foreign substances. The capacity of neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes for phagocytosis is determined by their number and ability to reach the relevant site, adhere to endothelial surfaces, respond to chemical signals (chemotaxis), and complete the process of phagocytosis.4 The study of alterations in phagocytosis with age must then involve examinations of each of these steps, and are inherently more difficult in human populations than in disease-free inbred animals. Extrapolation of studies of senescent mice to humans suggests age itself does not attenuate response to bacterial capsular antigens in a well-vascularized area such as the lung.5., 6. Niwa et al reported a deterioration in neutrophil chemotaxis and increase in serum lipid peroxidase in the nonsurviving cohort of a 7-year longitudinal study, suggesting a preterminal but not necessarily \u201cnormal\u201d aging alteration in these factors.7 However, age-related effectiveness in chemotaxis may be reduced in less vascular tissues in vivo, such as in the skin, which also has a number of other changes that may impair the ability of cells in the vascular compartment to reach a site of infection.8 Although elderly persons preserve the number and overall phagocytic capacity, in vitro neutrophil functions (including endothelial adherence, migration, granule secretory behavior such as superoxide production, nitric oxide, and apoptosis) appear to be reduced with age,9., 10., 11. and significantly fewer neutrophils arrive at the skin abrasion sites studied in older people.12 How this translates to immune response and immune-mediated repair in infected or otherwise physiologically stressed older people remains unknown. Although the expression of TLRs and GM-CSF receptors are not diminished, ligation of these receptors results in altered signal transduction. With aging, alterations in signal transduction of these receptors may be involved in the defective function of neutrophils with decreased response to stimuli such as infection with gram positive bacteria.13., 14. These changes in the elderly, unlike in the young, could be the result of changes in the recruitment of TLR4 into lipid rafts and no-raft fractions (the domains on plasma membrane that play an important role in cell signaling) with LPS stimulation.15 And similarly, the activation through GM-CSF on the surface of these cells is also altered in the elderly because of an age-related presence of a phosphatase in the lipid raft blocking cell activation and contributing to decreased response to GM-CSF in neutrophils from older people.16\n",

            "text": "Macrophage activation also appears to change with age; this may be partially attributable to a reduced gamma interferon signal from T lymphocytes.17., 18. A decrease in the number of macrophage precursors and macrophages is observed in bone marrow.19 Although it is not clear if there is an age-associated decrease of TLR on the surface of aged macrophages, defective production of cytokines has been observed after TLR stimulation, possibly due to altered signal transduction.20., 21. With aging, there is diminished expression of MHC class II molecules both in humans and in mice, resulting in diminished antigen recognition and processing by these antigen presenting cells.19., 22. In addition, activated macrophages from humans and mice produce higher levels of prostaglandin E2, which may negatively influence antigen presentation.19 Fewer signals at the site of infection may be a consequence of reduced numbers of activated T cells locally due to reduced antigen processing capacity of macrophages. Fewer T cells and the defective expression of homing markers to attract T cells from peripheral blood into inflamed tissues23 suggests that increased susceptibility of old mice to, for example, tuberculosis, reflects an impaired capacity to focus mediator cells and the additional cytokine they may express at sites of infection (see more on T-cell changes with age in later discussion). These observations may help explain why late-life tuberculosis or reactivation tuberculosis occurs and remains clinically important in geriatric populations. The change in function of antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC) with aging is less well defined. A decrease in number and migration of Langerhans cells in skin has been described in elderly people,24 but their function remains sufficient for antigen presentation.25 In contrast, DCs from the elderly who are considered \u201cfrail\u2019\u2019 have been demonstrated to have reduced expression of costimulatory molecules, secrete less interleukin (IL)-12, and stimulate a less robust T-cell proliferative response when compared with those who are not \u201cfrail.26\n\u201d\n",

The competency of adaptive immune function declines with age primarily because of a dramatic decline in production of na\u00efve lymphocytes because of a decline in thymic output and an increase in inert memory lymphocytes (see later discussion). Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells isolated from aged humans and animals display a decreased in vitro responsiveness and altered profiles of cytokine secretion to mitogen stimulation and expand poorly and give rise to fewer effector cells when compared with na\u00efve CD4+ T cells isolated from younger hosts. Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells from aged animals produce about half the IL-2 as young cells on initial stimulation with antigen-antigen presenting cells. Also the helper function of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells for antibody production is also decreased.56 But newly generated CD4+ cells in aged mice respond quite well to antigens and are able to expand with adequate IL-2 production with good cognate helper function. Thus these age-related defects in na\u00efve CD4+ T cells appear to be a result of the chronologic age of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells rather than the chronologic age of the individual. These aged na\u00efve CD4+ T cells proliferate less and produce less IL-2 in response to antigenic stimulation than na\u00efve CD4+ T cells that have not undergone homeostatic divisions in the peripheral blood. The mechanism underlying homeostasis associated dysfunction of na\u00efve CD4 T cells is not known. But in contrast to na\u00efve cells, memory CD4+ T cells are long lived, maintained by homeostatic cytokines, and are relatively competent with age. Isolated CD4+ T cells from healthy elderly human and old mice are normal in antigen proliferation in vitro.57 Memory CD4+ T cells generated from young age respond well to antigens over time, whereas memory CD4+ T cells derived from older age respond poorly.58 Memory T cells generated from aged na\u00efve T cells, upon stimulation, survive and persist well, but they are markedly defective in proliferation and cytokine secretion during recall responses with impaired cognate help for humoral immunity. Healthy elderly are able to mount a CD4+ T-cell response comparable to that observed in younger individuals when vaccinated with influenza, but they exhibit an impaired long-term CD4+ T-cell immune response to the influenza vaccine.59 Vaccination with influenza results in increased IL-2 secretion in response to viral antigen in vitro.60., 61. But the number of influenza-specific cytotoxic T cells declines with age, with no increase after vaccination.62\n",

When this clonal expansion reaches a critical level, the diversity of T-cell repertoire is reduced and its ability to protect against new infections is compromised as seen when elderly humans are exposed to new antigens. For example, the effect of host age was studied in the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and it was discovered that the antigen recognition repertoire of T cells was approximately 108 in young adults but only 106 in the elderly.66 Notably, most of the SARS mortality was observed in infected persons over the age of 50 years. Accumulation of CD28\u2013CD8+ T cells are also found in viral infections, such as CMV, EBV, and hepatitis C, so CD28\u2013CD8+ T cells may be derived from CD28\u2013CD8+ T cells after repeated antigenic stimulation.67 This clonal expansion of CD28\u2013CD8+ T cells appears to be associated with increased infections and failed response to vaccines in the elderly. As a result of the combination of thymic involution, repeated antigenic exposure and alteration in susceptibility to apoptosis (increased for CD4 and decreased for CD8), the thymic and lymphoid tissue in the aged host becomes populated with anergic (nonresponsive) memory CD8+CD28\u2013 T cells resulting in impaired cell mediated immunity. The potential for far-reaching effects of the presence of senescent T cells is illustrated by the correlation between poor humoral response to vaccination in the elderly and an increase in the proportion of CD8 T cells that lack expression of CD28.68., 69.\n",

            "text": "There is also a decline in delayed-type skin hypersensitivity (DTH)70., 71., 72., 73. and the assessment of this has become a useful measure of cell-mediated immunity. Generally, a battery of skin test antigens (usually four to six antigens) is required to adequately assess DTH. The number of skin test positive reactions declines with age from more than 80% in young individuals to less than 20% in older individuals.73 As with most functional measures in geriatric populations, there is remarkable heterogeneity. In one study,72 17.9% of subjects over age 66 years and living at home were anergic compared with 41% who were living in a nursing home but able to care for themselves and 60% who were functionally impaired and living in a nursing home. Although skin testing is a good indicator of cell-mediated immunologic health, it is heavily influenced by both acute and chronic illnesses and the component of anergy because of \u201caging\u201d is difficult to discern. Furthermore, concomitant in vitro testing suggests that not all anergic patients have impaired in vitro responses,37., 74. suggesting that some of the observed skin test anergy may be either technical (i.e., due to difficulty in intradermal injection in the skin of elderly people) or because of a deficit in antigen presentation, as described above. Thus both in vivo cutaneous DTH assessment and in vitro lymphocyte testing may be necessary to more adequately identify individuals who are truly anergic and presumably immunodeficient. The relevance of this type of determination is apparent by the repeated demonstrations of an association between anergy and mortality.43., 72., 73., 75., 76., 77.\n",

            "text": "In the humoral immune system, there are no consistent changes in the number of peripheral blood B cells with age. The decline in antibody production following vaccination in the elderly is the result of reduced antigen-specific B-cell expansion and differentiation, leading to production of low titres of antigen-specific IgG. Most studies indicate a mild to moderate increase in total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA levels with no change in IgM levels.83., 84. Declines in antibody titers to specific foreign antigens have been noted, including naturally occurring antibodies to the isoagglutinins,85 and titers of antibody to foreign antigens such as microbial antigens.86., 87., 88., 89., 90. Both the primary91 and secondary immune responses to vaccination are impaired. Elderly patients tend to have lower peak titers of antibody and more rapid declines in titers after immunization92., 93. and the peak titer occurring slightly later (2 to 6 weeks rather than 2 to 3 weeks postvaccination) than in younger people.94 In contrast, serum autoantibodies may have organ specificity, such as antiparietal cell, antithyroglobulin, and antineuronal antibodies.46., 95., 96., 97., 98., 99., 100., 101. With aging, there is a decreased generation of early progenitor B cells resulting in low output of new na\u00efve B cells with clonal expansion of antigen-experienced B cells. This results in limited repertoire in immunoglobulin generation (through class switch) in B cells as observed in elderly humans and old mice102 with limited antigen-specific B-cell expansion and differentiation, leading to production of reduced titers of antigen-specific IgG. The antibodies produced by older B cells are commonly of low affinity due to reduced class switching and somatic recombination in the variable region of the immunoglobulin gene that is necessary for antibody production and diversity. The generation of memory B cells is highly dependent on germinal centers, the formation of which are known to decline with age. The formation of germinal centers is dependent to some extent on interactions of B cells with CD4+ T helper cells, and the age-related quantitative and qualitative changes in T and B cells may account, in large part, for the clinically observed diminished response to vaccines. For example, although 70% to 90% of individuals less than 65 years old are effectively protected after influenza vaccination, only 10% to 30% of frail elderly are protected.105\n",

In vitro studies to assess functional aspects of lymphocytes after stimulation with mitogens show a decline in proliferative responses possibly as a result of decreased T-cell lymphokine production and regulation, particularly interleukin-2 (IL-2).44., 48., 107., 108. Decreases in the percentage of IL-2 receptor positive cells, IL-2 receptor density, and in the expression of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor specific mRNA in old humans have been reported.48., 109. IL-2 production in response to specific antigens also declines. There is a profound decline in the proliferative capacity of T lymphocytes to nonspecific mitogens.46., 48., 73., 110. In addition, antigen-specific declines in the proliferative potential of T cells have been demonstrated.70., 111. The number and affinity of mitogen receptors on T lymphocytes do not change with age.112 However, the number of T lymphocytes capable of dividing in response to mitogen exposure is reduced, and the activated T cells do not undergo as many divisions.80 Superimposed upon the accumulation of a relatively inert na\u00efve T-cell fraction observed with advancing age, there appears also to be a shift in predominance of helper T-cell responses from type 1 (TH1) to type 2 (TH2). Cells of the TH1 type produce IL-2, interferon-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 and predominantly mediate cell-mediated immune and inflammatory responses, whereas cells of the TH2 type produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10, factors that enhance humoral immunity (Figure-13-1\n).56 Whereas the decline in IL-2 and IL-12 may contribute to the observed decline in cellular immune function, the increase in proinflammatory cytokines (particularly IL-6) may contribute to the metabolic changes associated with frailty. It has been proposed that a chronic exposure to such proinflammatory signals contributes to the phenotype of frailty.113 In fact, elevated IL-6 levels have been shown to correlate well with functional decline and mortality in a population of community-dwelling elderly people.114 Thus the inflammation-related biomarkers are powerful predictors of frailty and mortality115., 116. in the elderly and this phenomenon is referred to as \u201cinflamm-aging.49\u201d",

Indeed, immune mechanisms may result in atherosclerosis, a final common pathway of pathology secondary to a variety of vascular insults.130 A number of antivascular antibodies have been described in man131., 132., 133., 134. that are associated with diseases of the vasculature. Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with a variety of pathologic states of the vasculature, including stroke and vascular dementia,135., 136. temporal arteritis, and ischemic heart disease.137., 138. However, the exact mechanism by which antiphospholipid antibodies cause vascular injury remains unknown.139 The increased occurrence of antiphospholipid antibodies with age140., 141., 142. and the association of these autoantibodies with vascular disease may represent a predisposing immunologic factor for immune-mediated vascular disease in elderly people. Autoantibodies to vascular heparan sulfate proteoglycans (vHSPG) may also be important in vascular injury in old age,133 since vHSPG plays an important role in normal anticoagulation and cholesterol metabolism.143\n",

The problem with this hypothesis is that, as rational as it sounds, it has been very difficult to prove (see later discussion). Furthermore, there are other explanations for the observed increased malignant disease in the elderly, not the least of which is the estimated prolonged time (measured in decades for many epithelial tumors) it takes to sustain the multiple genetic and epigenetic events required for malignant transformation and tumor growth to the point of clinical detection. An alternative explanation suggests that the host and host factors change over time, favoring progression and expression in later life. These two hypotheses to explain the increase in late-life malignancy have aptly been described as \u201cseed vs. soil.\u201d145\n",

Although bimodal in incidence, the peak in late-life lymphoma includes a disproportionate incidence of nodular B-cell types.146 Both old humans and mice have commonly exhibited a monoclonal gammopathy (paraprotein) in the last quartile of the life span.47., 48., 49., 50., 51., 52., 53., 54., 55., 56., 57., 58., 59., 60., 61., 62., 63., 64., 65., 66., 67., 68., 69., 70., 71., 72., 73., 74., 75., 76., 77., 78., 79., 80., 81., 82., 83., 84., 85., 86., 87., 88., 89., 90., 91., 92., 93., 94., 95., 96., 97., 98., 99., 100., 101., 102., 103., 104., 105., 106., 107., 108., 109., 110., 111., 112., 113., 114., 115., 116., 117., 118., 119., 120., 121., 122., 123., 124., 125., 126., 127., 128., 129., 130., 131., 132., 133., 134., 135., 136., 137., 138., 139., 140., 141., 142., 143., 144., 145., 146., 147., 148., 149., 150. Monoclonal gammopathies increase with age and may occur in 79% of sera from subjects over the age of 95 years.151., 152., 153. Radl151 has defined four categories of age-associated monoclonal gammopathy: (1) myeloma or related disorders; (2) benign B-cell neoplasia; (3) immune deficiency, with T cell greater than B-cell loss; and (4) chronic antigenic stimulation. He speculates that the third category is by far the most common, and that this is what occurs with immune senescence. It is possible that age-associated immune dysfunction is initially associated with markers of aberrant immune regulation, such as increased levels of paraproteinemia and/or autoantibody, which may later contribute to the pathogenesis of lymphoma. Monoclonal gammopathies may cause morbidity, particularly renal disease in the absence of overt multiple myeloma.154 In a minority of cases of monoclonal gammopathies, a malignant evolution may occur.154., 155., 156. Multiple myeloma also demonstrates an age-related increase in incidence.157 Although treatment is not generally indicated for monoclonal gammopathies,152 treatment of myeloma is often useful. Another common malignant transformation of the lymphocyte in old age is chronic lymphocytic leukemia.158 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma also increases in incidence with age, whereas Hodgkin's lymphoma has a bimodal distribution.159\n",

It has long been proposed that the decline in immune function contributes to the increased incidence of malignancy. However, despite the appeal of such a hypothesis, scientific support has been limited and the topic remains controversial.164 Proponents of an immune explanation point to experiments in which outbred strains of mice with heterogeneous immune functions were followed for their life span.165., 166. Those that demonstrated better functions early in life (as determined by a limited panel of assays available at the time on a small sample of blood) were found to have fewer spontaneous malignancies and a longer life than those estimated to be less immunologically competent. Furthermore, it is difficult to deny that profoundly immunodeficient animals or humans are subject to a more frequent occurrence of malignant disease. Thus it would stand to reason that others with less severe immunodeficiency would also be subject to malignancy, perhaps less dramatically so. However, the malignancies associated with profound immunodeficiency (e.g., with AIDS or after organ transplantation) are usually lymphomas, Kaposi's sarcoma, or leukemia and not the more common malignancies of geriatric populations (lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancers). Accordingly, it is fair to say that the question of the influence of age-acquired immunodeficiency on the incidence of cancer in elderly people is unresolved. There is much greater consensus on the importance of immune senescence in the clinical management of cancer, including the problems associated with infection and disease progression.",

            "text": "Most of the significant morbidity and excess mortality during influenza epidemics occurs in older adults.170 Age itself, in addition to and separate from the many comorbid conditions of older people, is a significant risk factor for severe complications of influenza.171 It is widely held that much of the increased susceptibility of elderly people to influenza and its complications are attributable to immunologic factors, including reduced antibody responsiveness and influenza-specific cell-mediated immunity as discussed above. The role of humoral immunity, especially in the form of neutralizing antibodies, is perhaps most important for preventing and limiting the initial infection172 rather than promoting recovery. T-cell-mediated responses appear to be more important and primarily involved in postinfection viral clearance and recovery; influenza-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity correlates with rapid clearance of virus in infected human volunteers, even in the absence of detectable serum antibody.173 This has been experimentally confirmed in several studies through the adoptive transfer of influenza-specific CTLs in mouse models.174., 175. No doubt influenza-specific antibody declines with age, whether because of natural infection or vaccination,176., 177., 178. and this presumably translates to an increased risk of influenza infection. However, and perhaps equally important, CTL,62., 179. human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction by influenza-specific T-cell clones, and lymphocyte proliferative responses also decline with age. T cell-mediated cytokine responses, most notably IL-2, also decrease with age, although this has not been as clearly established for healthy elderly people61 as it has been for frail elderly people.60 Together these observations account for much of the age-related increase in influenza susceptibility and morbidity. Furthermore, although influenza in otherwise healthy unvaccinated elderly people leads to an illness that lasts nearly twice as long as their younger counterparts, influenza illness duration in those elderly people previously vaccinated (i.e., vaccine failures) is comparable to the illness duration in vaccinated healthy young adults. This observation remains true when the vaccine-to-circulating strain match is poor, negating poor vaccine match as a reason not to vaccinate seniors annually. In the long-term care setting, influenza vaccination was found to be effective in reducing influenza-like illness and preventing pneumonia, hospitalization, and deaths (both infectious and \u201call cause\u201d mortality). Among the elderly residing in the community setting, the benefits of annual vaccination have been demonstrably modest in some studies,180 and more effective in others.81., 182. Among many efforts to increase the immune response and hence protection from influenza vaccination in the elderly, component hemagglutinin dose within the vaccine and higher doses were found to be more immunogenic.183 It is important to note that, despite all of the changes occurring with age and comorbid conditions of age, influenza vaccine still is highly cost-effective in reducing influenza-related infections and complications, especially in the high-risk elderly population.171., 182., 184.\n",

            "text": "Herpes zoster (shingles) is caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV) and is increasingly prevalent with advancing age, as are its severity and complications.196., 197., 198., 199., 200. The majority of cases occur after the age of 60 years201 and by 80 years, the annual attack rate is 0.8%. Two major complications of herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia and cranial nerve zoster (often of the ophthalmic nerve, and not infrequently resulting in lower motor neuron paresis), are the most disabling. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs in more than 25% of patients 60 years and older and is strongly associated with sleep disturbance and depression.202., 203., 204., 205., 206. Bell\u2019s palsy207 and M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s208 disease, both conditions associated with advanced age, have also been linked to herpes zoster. VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity correlates closely with susceptibility to herpes zoster in large populations, such as patients with lymphomas, bone marrow transplant recipients, and immunocompetent elderly persons.209., 210., 211., 212., 213., 214., 215., 216. Whereas a decline in VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity is a major precipitant for VZV reactivation,217 demonstrable VZV immunity limits the viral replication and spread.218 In a randomized clinical trial with a live attenuated VZV vaccine among adults aged 60 years and over, vaccination reduced the incidence of herpes zoster, and postherpetic neuralgia compared with those who received a placebo.219 The magnitude of benefit with reduction in postherpetic neuralgia was more pronounced in those aged 70 years or more. This study led to approval of vaccine among the elderly greater than 60 years of age in the United States, and also in Europe and Australia.",

Serum protein electrophoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis are useful to rule out monoclonal gammopathy, myeloma, and some forms of lymphoma, and may also provide clues to chronic inflammatory disease (polyclonal gammopathy, reduced albumin). Specific antibody titers such as isoagglutinins also provide additional information regarding B-cell function. The integrity of the cellular immune system is tested by blood leukocyte counts (including absolute lymphocyte counts), delayed skin test hypersensitivity employing a panel of at least six antigens, and in vitro testing such as measurements of lymphocyte subsets, the proliferative capacity of lymphocytes in response to mitogen or specific antigens, and cytokine production. The latter tests are often performed in a standard clinical immunology laboratory. Other more sophisticated immune tests are also available from the clinical immunology consultant and research laboratory.",

The differentiation of na\u00efve T cells into various effector T-cell subsets occurs in response to stimulation by distinct antigen-presenting cells and cytokine exposure. These functional subsets include TH1, TH2, TH17, and Treg cells. These subsets play distinct roles in the genesis and control of cell-mediated immunity and inflammation. Traditionally, the TH1 responses have been implicated in many autoimmune and inflammatory disease states and cytokines produced by these cells, primarily IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 induce both mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration and activation in the target tissues. In this fashion, deregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines is thought to play a central role in the development of autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory responses. In contrast, TH2 cells secrete IL-4 and IL-10 that promote humoral immunity and inhibit TH1 responses and have been implicated in amelioration and remission of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. A third TH subset, named TH17, has recently been described that depends on IL-23 for survival and expansion, and has been identified as a major mediator of pathogenic inflammatory responses associated with autoimmunity, allergy, organ transplantation, and tumor development. Over the last few years, regulatory T (Treg) cells of several types have been identified and shown to play an active role to suppress autoreactive T cells; however, these cells are also capable of suppressing the host\u2019s ability to mount an optimal cell-mediated immune response to antigens and tumor cells if their numbers and activity are not controlled.",
