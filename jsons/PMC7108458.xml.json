Of all paediatric visits for RTI, acute cough is the most common complaint, accounting for up to 75% of visits (4,5). Despite this, most RTIs are self-limiting. A 2008 review by the UK\u2019s National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded that antibiotics do not confer a clinically significant reduction in the time taken to recover from an RTI. NICE guidelines recommend that antibiotics are not prescribed for the majority of paediatric RTIs (3), and in doing so are consistent with the 2011 European Respiratory Society adult prescribing guidelines (6). However, antibiotic prescribing rates remain high (7).",

The most prevalent bacterium was Staphylococcus aureus (detected in 33% of samples), followed by H. influenzae (24%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15%) and \u03b2 haemolytic Streptococcus A (8%). The most prevalent viruses were rhinoviruses (detected in 13% of samples), followed by enteroviruses (7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 6%) and influenza A (4.4%). Enteroviruses and rhinoviruses are genetically similar and some strains may be detected by both rhinovirus and enterovirus PCR tests. However of 407 patients in whom positive results were found with enterovirus and/or rhinovirus assays, only 17 (4.2%) tested positive using both assays. It is not possible to determine if these results represent assay cross-reactivity or dual infection. However for the purposes of this study we considered these 17 samples to represent dual rhinovirus/enterovirus infections.",

Marked decreases in rhinovirus and RSV prevalence were also replicated. Additionally, decreases in rhinovirus and RSV detection were observed by Regamey et al. in a 2008 study of nasal swabs from 128 children during and after RTI (17).
