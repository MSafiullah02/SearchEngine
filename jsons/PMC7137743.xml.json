Knudson deduced3 that in the familial form there had been an inherited loss of a gene responsible for suppressing tumour formation and that during the 100 million or so cell divisions that take place in retinoblasts during differentiation, the chances of losing a second copy of this gene were sufficiently high to make the development of a tumour likely, whereas two mutations would be required to cause disease in the non-familial cases, explaining their rarity and later (unifocal) presentation. Knudson's two-hit hypothesis ignited the field of cancer genetics and heralded the era of tumour-suppressor biology. Knudson's predictions were fulfilled in a rich period of cancer research that culminated in the cloning of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene in the laboratory of Robert Weinberg4 some 14 years later, where somatic mutation of the same RB gene was found in the tumours of non-hereditary cases. This finding was the forerunner of the observation, now well established through the work of Vogelstein and others,5 that patients with common cancers often have mutations in the same genes that are responsible for the familial forms.",

Fast-forward about 30 years from Knudson's pioneering observations: the cancer world is radically altered. The development of genomic technology has enabled the analysis and characterisation of thousands of genes in biopsy material including, importantly, archival material. Much effort is being devoted to finding gene signatures, which allow patients to be better characterised especially in relation to the probable prognosis and response to treatment.6, 7, 8 The results suggest that molecular signatures do indeed predict responses to therapy.

Identification of the mutation responsible for the failure of the proteinase inhibitor to protect the lungs revealed the position of the active site that confers specificity as an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. A similar sequence was present on another plasma protease inhibitor, antithrombin. Comparison of the two sites suggested that the specificity of inhibition depended on one aminoacid.14 The case of a 14-year-old boy in Pittsburgh with a fatal haemorrhagic disorder, whose plasma contained an electrophoretic variant of alpha-1 antitrypsin that acted as an inhibitor of coagulation, provided confirmation. Carrell predicted and established that a methionine in the active site had mutated to arginine, changing the specificity of the inhibitor from an antineutrophil protease to an antithrombin\u2014a dramatic natural experiment in protein engineering.15\n",

            "text": "A second example from Robin Carrell's group also relates to alpha-1 antitrypsin. David Lomas, a respiratory doctor, proposed that intracellular aggregation of the mutated molecule in hepatocytes reduced secretion of alpha-1 antitrypsin and suggested that the aggregated molecules, which could seen by electron microscopy (figure 2\n), were the cause of hepatocyte injury and cirrhosis, and by structural studies showed the molecular mechanisms responsible.16 That this process might be a more general pathogenic mechanism in diseases characterised by intracellular inclusion bodies was graphically shown by a further case study. A family doctor in upstate New York insisted on an autopsy for a patient aged 56 years who died of an atypical dementia. Neuropathological examination at nearby Syracuse revealed intraneural inclusion bodies with partial sequences identical to a newly identified serpin\u2014neuroserpin\u2014specific to neurons. It then came to light that the patient was a member of a family inheriting, with mendelian dominance, a trait resulting in the onset of an encephalopathy and dementia between age 45 and 60 years.17 The similarities of the intraneural inclusions with those in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency led to a collaboration between the workers at Syracuse and Carrell and Lomas, who showed that every step in the pathway that Lomas had observed with the mutated alpha-1 antitrypsin was faithfully reproduced with the abnormal neuroserpin. Thus, intracellular polymerisation results in a cellular attrition, which in the hepatocyte leads to cirrhosis and in the neuron leads to encephalopathy and dementia.18\n",

These diseases have a striking characteristic that had no explanation in mendelian genetics: the phenomenon of anticipation, where a genetic disease becomes increasingly severe and presents earlier in successive generations. Genomic analysis provided the explanation, for in successive generations the number of repeats expands and correlates inversely with severity and age of presentation. No counterpart to these human disorders has been found in animals.20\n",

Only lately, by genetic technology, has it been shown in mice that knockouts of another complement regulatory factor, factor H, which physiologically inhibits the alternative pathway, develop MPGN, establishing beyond doubt the primary and causal role of unrestrained alternative pathway activation in this disorder.40\n",

Peter Mathieson was able to show that this could indeed take place in vitro.42 But the finding of complement factor D in adipocytes was of more general significance, for it was the earliest unequivocal indication that adipocytes were not just storage cells for excess fat and might have other hitherto unsuspected biological functions.

The beginnings were the discovery of the genetically obese mouse, the ob/ob mouse, and the pioneering parabiotic experiments linking ob/ob mice to normal mice\u2014establishing that normal mice provided a factor that reversed the obesity of the ob/ob mice.43 Clearly, the ob/ob mouse lacked a factor present in the blood of normal mice, which controlled food intake and fat mass. Then, in 1995, Friedman and his colleagues identified that the ob/ob mouse was deficient in leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells that acted on the hypothalamus.44 Early hopes that leptin might be of value in treating obesity were dashed by the finding that under normal circumstances, obese human beings have high plasma leptin concentrations and that malnourished individuals have low plasma leptin levels, reflecting in both circumstances adipocyte mass. Stephen O'Rahilly's group were the first to identify the human equivalents of the ob/ob mouse in a series of consanguineous families in whom leptin is totally absent.45 The children had morbid obesity characterised by uncontrollable hyperphagia dramatically reversed by administration of recombinant leptin\u2014a remarkable (albeit extreme) demonstration of the centrality of the control mechanisms of satiety to the understanding of obesity figure 4\n.46\n",

Immunofluorescence of renal biopsy samples usually shows no evidence of accumulation of immune reactants in the kidney, and antigen-antibody complexes are not detected in the circulation, findings that led some to use the term pauci-immune. Such patients therefore did not match the Dixon experimental model, and the rationale for treating this group of patients with immunosuppressive drugs or plasma exchange was flimsy. Surprisingly, the response to the regimen of plasma exchange and cytotoxic drugs was better than that of patients with anti-GBM disease54 What might be the explanation? It was not until 1982 that a circulating autoantibody (whose significance was not immediately appreciated)55, 56 was detected in plasma of this category of RPGN patients, which confusingly was directed to intracellular antigens in neutrophils\u2014antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2014and later associated with Wegener's granulomatosis.57 In due course the principal targets of ANCA were identified as myeloperoxidase and antiproteinase 3; ANCA tests proved to be of great diagnostic and practical value in monitoring therapy.58 Further work showed that the antibody would activate neutrophils and make them potentially capable of enhancing tissue damage.59 However, it was still not clear whether ANCA was cause or consequence of the nephritis or vasculitis. Resolution required the technology of the late 20th century, in which the gene for myeloperoxidase (MPO) was knocked out in a mouse: the knockout mice were immunised with mouse myeloperoxidase to which they made antibodies, and these antibodies were then transferred to normal mice (which had MPO in their white cells) and necrotising vasculitis and nephritis was produced.60\n",

We sought to link academic and service developments at Addenbrooke's, a 1000-bed hospital, the provider of hospital care to a substantial population of East Anglia. A priority was the development of a culture of clinical research, a key to which is provision of advanced medical technology including, in particular, imaging technology. A further goal was promotion of population-based medical research, and with the help of the NHS we established the Institute of Public Health, incorporating the MRC Biostatistics Unit, the University department, and NHS public health groups.",

The medically qualified research worker has one outstanding advantage: there is no system of university education that teaches human biology as effectively as a medical school does. But we need to do better by present and future generations of medical students. Of concern is the tendency for teaching and research to become distinct activities: research is increasingly undertaken in purpose-built laboratories, entry to which is restricted (not least because of animal terrorists). Medical students, who by-and-large are exceptionally gifted, can reasonably expect to have contact with the best researchers in their medical schools, as I did nearly half a century ago. But the competitive pressure of research and of the Research Assessment Exercise means that many university staff, especially those wholly funded by research grants, believe they cannot afford to spend time teaching. Several UK medical schools are now developing MB/PhD programmes to provide exceptional students an early opportunity to engage in research before the constraints of professional training occur. It is clear from the Cambridge programme, which started in 1990, that a majority of its graduates are committed to academic careers and are better prepared to address the complex issues ahead.",
