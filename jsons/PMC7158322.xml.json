Primary esophageal tuberculosis is extremely rare.8, 9, 10 The most common symptoms of esophageal tuberculosis are dysphagia, weight loss, and retrosternal pain.11 Imaging modalities may show extrinsic compression by involved lymph nodes in the mediastinum, traction diverticula, stricture, kinking of the esophagus, sinus or fistulous tract, and pseudotumoral masses.12 Chest computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasonography reveal extrinsic nodular masses, consistent with mediastinal lymphadenopathy showing central hypodensity, rim enhancement, and calcification.8, 13 Endoscopic examination shows shallow ulcers with smooth border, a gray purulent base, and irregularly infiltrated edges.14, 15 Synchronous endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) commonly shows matted, heterogeneous lymph nodes with hypoechoic centers.7\n",

Superficial colonization, particularly of nonviable tissue, does not necessarily indicate clinically significant disease. Although cytologic brushings from the plaques are more sensitive for fungal detection, biopsies are required to ascertain whether the fungus has invaded tissue.

Therefore superficial biopsy specimens that contain only squamous epithelium or brushings for cytology are usually insufficient for the evaluation of CMV infection, and it is recommended that biopsies include the granulation tissue of the ulcer bed. Classic cytopathic effects of CMV include intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions surrounded by a halo with margination of the chromatin to the nuclear membrane. In contrast to HSV and VZV, multiple small cytoplasmic inclusions may be seen with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and to advantage with PAS and GMS. CMV can superinfect the ulcerations caused by HSV, and mixed infections are common in severely immunocompromised individuals (Fig. 10.7\n). Immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies or genetic probing for virus may be necessary to establish the diagnosis, especially if the patient has received antiviral agents prophylactically, because such agents can inhibit nuclear cytopathic changes.",

It is characterized by segmental necrosis of the proximal jejunum and a high mortality rate if not diagnosed early and appropriately treated. It can be related to food poisoning but is not associated with hospitalization or antibiotic therapy. In addition to antibiotics, advanced cases require surgical resection of necrotic bowel. The disease was first reported as Darmbrand (burnt bowels) in northern Germany after World War II, where starved children and adults developed it after ingestion of large meals of meats and vegetables. It was prevalent between 1944 and 1948 but then disappeared in Europe as the nutritional status of its population improved. In 1963 a similar disease was reported from the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, where predominantly male children and young adults presented with severe abdominal pain after ceremonial feasting on large amounts of sweet potatoes and inadequately cooked pork contaminated with pig intestine. It was termed \u201cpigbel,\u201d a pidgin English term for abdominal pain following a pig feast. Nowadays, enteritis necroticans is rarely seen in developed countries, and the majority of affected subjects are diabetics.150, 151 An impaired ability to degrade exogenous toxins due to decreased secretion of pancreatic protease in diabetics and individuals on low-protein diets, or the presence of natural protease inhibitors in sweet potato or soybean flour, together with delayed transit through the small intestine, may contribute to this unique form of clostridial infection.150\n",

Severe complications, such as hemorrhage and perforation, are often preceded by vague symptoms for up to 2 weeks.220, 221 The mortality associated with CMV enteritis is related to older age (>65 years) and delay in instituting therapy but not to the anatomic site of the infection.222\n",

The female pseudocoelem includes paired genital tubes that contain innumerable ova which, when mature, exhibit prominent mamillations (Fig. 10.28\n).

In an unfavorable environment, rhabditiform larvae transform into filariform larvae (parasitic phase). In the autoinfection cycle, rhabditiform larvae change into infective filiform larvae in the intestine or on the perianal skin and directly invade the host. This autoinfective capability leads to prolonged illness. Disseminated infection (i.e., migration of larvae to organs beyond the range of the autoinfective cycle) can occur in immunocompromised hosts and results in severe, life-threatening illness.250, 251, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262 Systemic parasitic infection predisposes to gram-negative sepsis.",

Histologically the crypts are often distended by numerous larvae and adult worms (Fig. 10.29\n), but the organisms may be difficult to detect due to their patchy distribution. Other histologic features include villous blunting, ulcers and necrosis, edema, and a dense eosinophilic infiltrate of the lamina propria.

The changes are commonly patchy, and the overall mucosal architecture is preserved. Minimal degenerative changes, limited to the upper half of the mucosa, can be seen. These include mucin depletion and epithelial damage with flattened cytoplasm associated with cryptic dilatation.

However, in the gastrointestinal tract, it is not uncommon for infected cells to show indistinct, smudged, hematophilic nuclei.

The adult pinworm attaches to the cecal mucosa, and the worm is commonly observed in the lumen of the appendix. Symptoms result from the nocturnal migration of the adult female; she lays eggs on the perianal skin, causing intense pruritus. Diagnosis is classically established by adhering the deposited ova to cellophane tape and examining them under the microscope. Refractile ova are characteristically flattened on one side. The helminth is small, shows a muscular wall, and exhibits prominent lateral alae projecting from the cuticle throughout its length. The central oviducts contain the characteristic flattened eggs. The surrounding mucosa is generally inflamed, and tissue eosinophilia may be present (Fig. 10.44\n). Inflammatory reaction may produce a presenting polyp or even a mass, sometimes mistaken for a carcinoma.304 Aberrant migration can lead to similar lesions in the vagina and bladder.",
