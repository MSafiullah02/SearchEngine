            "text": "For a project that seeks to identify the factors that impact the status of intellectual property in Asia's emerging markets, Singapore is a very interesting case study. For one thing, Singapore's experience appears to be a textbook example of the theory that advocates that a strong IP infrastructure promotes economic growth. When Singapore became an independent nation in 1965, her GNI per capita of US$529 was mainly derived from a colonial economy that was highly dependent on entrep\u00f4t trade 2 and the British Army. This Third World economy did not have a very good physical infrastructure, much less a strong IP infrastructure. Today, the scene is very different. Singapore is a highly industrialised country whose GNI per capita of US$33,919 3 qualifies her as a \"high income country\" in the books of the World Bank, placing her with developed/First World countries. 4 On the IP front, her legal regime of protection is \"TRIPS-plus,\" and recently she even emerged as one of only three Asian countries (the others being Japan and Taiwan) on the list of the top twenty-five countries in the world with the lowest software piracy rates. 5 As this paper will show, there is a co-relationship between the degree of maturity of the IP infrastructure in Singapore and that of her economy: the growth of her IP infrastructure is in fact the result of concerted efforts of her policy-makers to nurture it, to use it as a tool to achieve economic goals. This paper first tracks the evolution of the IP laws of Singapore, as well as the policy reasons underlying the changes made during the following three stages of her economic development:",

Foreign investors were actively wooed 10 to develop their manufacturing operations in Singapore for export to world markets-both in low-technology, labour-intensive industries (e.g., textile, garment, and toy factories were set up by Hong Kong and Taiwanese businesses) and in higher-technology industries. The electronics sector began during these early years with American MNCs setting up in Singapore: Texas Instruments in 1968, National Semiconductor in 1969, Hewlett-Packard in 1970, etc. From the outset, the political leaders were not suspicious of MNCs; they did not believe that MNCs would exploit Singapore. In the words of Mr. Lee, \"If MNCs could give our workers employment and teach them technical and engineering skills and management knowhow, we should bring in the MNCs.\" 11 By the late 1970s, Singapore had solved its unemployment problem. 12 In fact, its economic planning succeeded so well that it was facing a new problem: a tight labour market and upward pressure on wages, which made Singapore a less attractive place for MNCs relative to the emerging low-cost countries in the region. The 1980s, therefore, saw Singapore embark on what the Government called the \"Second Industrial Revolution,\" 13 wherein her investment policy shifted toward promoting higher value-added and skills-intensive activities such as engineering design and computer services.",

First, it was to deal with the increase in the importation and sale of pirated records of copyrighted musical works. This problem, according to the Minister of Law and National Development at that time, threatened the livelihood of local artists, composers, and musicians, as well as the subsistence of three newly established sound recording companies in the Jurong Industrial Park. The proposed law therefore imposed penalties (fine and/or imprisonment) for the manufacture or commercial exploitation of pirated gramophone records. The second purpose of the Act was to exempt Government broadcasting from infringement of copyright in musical works and in gramophone records, in order to stop payment of royalties to the Performing Rights Society (PRS) and International Federation of Phonographic Industry (IFPI nial rule, the Governor of Singapore had issued a directive to make the payments to these U.K.-based organisations. The new political leaders of Singapore did not agree that such payments were due, since broadcasting in Singapore was a nonprofit activity undertaken by the Government and had an educational component. The exemption proposed by the new bill would dispense with further payments to PRS and IPFI, thereby keeping the cost of broadcasting as low as possible for the benefit of the people.",

The reason, I repeat, is that these conventions are for the benefit of the developed countries who refuse to share their knowledge with us. It is for this reason that a Bill of this nature was not passed before. I have mentioned that three industries have been set up in Jurong producing musical records and it is for the protection of these industries that this Bill is introduced. 16 This renunciation of IP, one might say, epitomises the attitude of a Third World country towards IP. (Indeed, even the United States, in its early days as a netimporter of copyright works, did not exactly give priority to the protection of foreigners' works under its copyright law (the 1790 Act), thereby allowing piracy in the United States of books by British authors such as Charles Dickens. 17 ) The Minister's speech is also interesting for another reason: it demonstrates how focused policy-makers in Singapore can be, how willing they can be to toughen up IP laws in order to achieve a particular economic goal-in this case, the survival of the three sound recording companies in the Jurong Industrial Park.",

By spoke in Parliament of the importance of having stronger, better copyright laws if Singapore wanted to \"foster an environment of creativity, and to encourage the development of our software industry.\" 19 A revamp of copyright law was proposed in 1986. When introducing this new law in Parliament, the Minister of Law also repeated the need for Singapore to update its copyright law to keep abreast of developments in the field of computer science, sound and video recording, cable television, satellite broadcasting, and photocopying. Some emphasis was given to the software industry-the need to provide the legal framework necessary for the development of a strong software industry in Singapore, so that major international computer companies and software houses planning to set up software development centres in Singapore could be assured that their products would be adequately protected. 20 There was another reason for Singapore's decision in 1985-1986 to improve its copyright law. The 1980s was the era when developed countries started linking international trade with IP protection. In particular, the United States had passed the Trade & Tariff Act in 1984, tying the trading benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) granted to developing countries, to their respect and protection of U.S.-origin IP. The United States exerted pressure on Singapore to enact a new copyright law before the completion of the U.S. GSP Review at the end of January 1987, or face the consequences of losing her GSP status, that is, higher cost for Singapore goods imported into the United States because of the tariffs payable on these imports, making them less competitive vis-\u00e0-vis imports from other developing countries. In fact, Singapore was promised a better GSP package if the timing and quality of her new copyright law satisfied the United States. 21 The U.S. influence on the enactment of the Copyright Act is not groundless speculation. The Minister of Law himself candidly acknowledged this, when he introduced the Copyright Bill in Parliament in 1986: Beyond our own requirements, I should also mention that in recent years one significant source of friction with our trading partners, particularly the United States, has been the inadequacy of our existing copyright laws. \u2026 I hope that the introduction of this Bill will remove one contentious issue and so improve our relations with these partners. 22",

            "text": "The late 1980s saw intensifying competition from neighbouring developing countries. By 1992, for example, China had become the largest recipient of FDI in Asia, exceeding ASEAN's share in total. 30 To meet these challenges, Singapore's economic planning for the 1990s included strategies to promote the service sector together with manufacturing, to deepen the technology base, and to create an \"external\" economy through globalisation. The idea behind the strategy to deepen the technology base in Singapore was to move Singapore up the value-chain in manufacturing, especially in emerging fields such as biotechnology, and to attract research and development (R&D) activities. The policy-makers firmly believed that a solid IP infrastructure, particularly a sound patent system, was needed to achieve this goal. 31 The patent regime in Singapore dated back to the Registration of U.K. Patent Act 1937, a piece of colonial legislation which set up a system of re-registering a patent granted in the United Kingdom. 32 It was a costly, cumbersome, and time-consuming process. The Ministry of Law acted, announcing plans in 1990 for the review of this patent registration system. 33 Singapore became a contracting party to the WIPO Convention in December 1990, and the review of its patent law was done with the advice of WIPO. 34 The new Patents Act 1994 (still in force today) is modelled on the U.K. Patents Act 1977, but a few material differences exist. For example, the Singapore law expressly allows parallel imports, 35 and there is no prohibition against the patenting of animal or plant varieties or essentially biological processes for the production of animals or plants (other than microbiological processes or their products thereof). 36 This prohibition was considered and specifically rejected by the Select Committee set up to scrutinise the Patents Bill. The Select Committee took the view that allowing patents on varieties of plant and animal (non-human species) was necessary in order to encourage research into horticulture, agriculture, and biotechnology. 37 The difficult moral and ethical issues involved in such research did not appear to faze the policy-makers. However, it would not be fair to say that Singapore's utilitarian approach to IP completely ignores morality and ethics. In fact, unlike the United States, the new Patents Act has a provision prohibiting the patenting of an invention the publication or exploitation of which would generally be expected to encourage offensive, immoral, or anti-social behaviour. 38 Thus, any attempt to patent human beings and the related biological processes could be resolved by reference to this ordre public provision. 39 One other feature of the new patent regime should be highlighted. Given its relatively small economy and limited human resources, Singapore decided to avoid the substantial investment that would be needed to build up full-fledged search and examination capabilities in Singapore. Hence, patent registration in Singapore is a \"self-examination\" system, that is, there is no substantive examination of patent applications by the Singapore Registry of Patents. Instead, patent grants are made 34 based on search and examination reports furnished by designated foreign patent offices or the International Search and Preliminary Examinations Authorities under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Thus, at the same time as the Patents Act 1994 came into force in February 1995, Singapore acceded to the PCT, as well as to the Budapest Treaty and the Paris Convention. Plugging herself into the international patent registration system also accorded with Singapore's strategy to globalise. 40 For Singapore and her plans to globalise in the 1990s, the conclusion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations could not have been more timely. Singapore was all poised to enter the WTO on January 1, 1995, and to implement the minimum standards of IP protection recognised by the international community as set out in the TRIPS Agreement. 41 See Article 65(2) of the TRIPS Agreement, which provided a five-year transition period for developing countries, so that the deadline for implementation of the provisions therein for such countries was 2000. Singapore's status as a developing country is recognised by international agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. 42 This prohibition is the same as the notorious \"as such\" provision in Section 1(2) of the U.K.",

            "text": "There were other changes to Singapore's IP laws during the 1990s, which were not TRIPS-related; rather, they were part of the Government's efforts to adjust the IP laws to meet the needs of the public and the industries in Singapore, and/or to update the laws to keep abreast of the developments of new technology. Four sets of amendments will be mentioned as examples to illustrate this. First, an amendment to the copyright law was made in 1994 to ensure that copyright owners would not be able to exercise their monopoly to repel parallel imports. It has been mentioned earlier that the Copyright Act 1987 contains a provision specifically aimed at legitimising parallel imports. 46 The provision proved to fall somewhat short of this aim, a shortfall which became apparent in the litigation in Public Prosecutor v. Teoh Ai Nee. 47 Within one year after this case was decided in September 1993, the Government moved to amend the Copyright Act 1987 to plug the identified lacuna. 48 Second, an amendment to the copyright law was made in 1998 to delete a provision that excluded commercial entities from the \"fair dealing\" defence for the purpose of \"research or private study.\" 49 The existence of this provision had compelled the Court of Appeal to find, in Creative Technology Ltd. v. Aztech Systems Pte. Ltd., 50 that reverse engineering of software (by decompilation) for commercial purposes was prohibited by the Copyright Act 1987. There was no leeway for any consideration of the fairness or otherwise of the activity. 51 The difficulties posed by such a provision to R&D work in Singapore are obvious. About 46 Supra note 25, and accompanying text. 47 1 SLR 452 (1994). This case held that the importation of a copyright product and its distribution in Singapore would be unlawful if the imported article was manufactured abroad without the consent of the local owner in Singapore. Although the effect of the decision would still allow for parallel imports, for example, when the local and foreign owners are identical, one class of genuine imports-those manufactured in countries whose copyright owner is different from that in Singapore and where the Singapore copyright owner has not given his consent to the manufacture of the product-would be barred. 48 See Copyright (Amendment) Act 1994 (Aug. 25, 1994) (introducing new subsections 25(3)-(4)). 49 See the repealed Section 35(5), providing that, for the purpose of the fair dealing defence for \"research or private study,\" \"'research' shall not include industrial research or research carried out by corporate entities (not being bodies corporate owned or controlled by the Government), companies, associations or bodies of persons carrying on business.\" 50 1 SLR 621 (1997). The litigants, Creative Technology Ltd. and Aztech Systems Pte. Ltd., are Singapore companies and rivals in the sound card industry. Creative Technology Ltd. is the market leader, where its famous \"Sound Blaster\" sound card sets some of the industry standards. In order to develop a sound card that is compatible with the sound standards existing in the industry, Aztech reverse engineered (by decompiling) the software in the \"SoundBlaster\" sound card. The parties had also started litigation in the United States. When the action was brought in Singapore, the U. sixteen months after the Court of Appeal's judgment was delivered, this provision was repealed. 52 Third, a new Registered Designs Act 2000 was enacted. This discontinued the protection of designs registered in the United Kingdom and put in place a registration system, thereby making it an easier for businesses to obtain protection for their product designs in Singapore.",

Then, there were a few changes which were made to ensure that the expansion of copyright has not tilted too much in favour of copyright owners. In particular, Singapore jettisoned the British model of \"fair dealing,\" which is a narrower defence tied to specific purposes (research or private study; criticism or review; reporting of current events) in favour of a wider, \"open-ended\" model that resembles the American \"fair use\" defence. 70 Figures 1 and 2 (Appendix) show that the number of patent and trademark applications filed in the first six years of the new millennium has already outstripped the number filed in the preceding 10-year period.",

In 2001, the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) was converted into a statutory board. Beyond performing the traditional regulatory functions of registering patents and trademarks etc., IPOS also plays a critical role in policy development, law reform, and educational activities (especially to raise 69 See Copyright Act 1987, Sec. 43A, 107A (introduced in 2004). 70 See id. at Sec. 35. This \"open-end\" model of fair dealing raises issues as to whether its scope is wider than that allowed by the \"three-step\" test in Article 13 of the TRIPS Agreement (requiring WTO members to \"confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder\" The IP enforcement efforts by the police are complemented by a stiff sentencing policy from the courts. In Ong Ah Tiong v. Public Prosecutor, the former Chief Justice Yong Yung How (who retired in April 2006) heard an appeal from an accused who had been sentenced by the District Judge to thirty-two months' imprisonment on three counts of trademark infringement. The District Judge had adopted two principles in coming to this sentence: first, custodial sentences for IP counterfeiting offences are the norm unless the quantity of infringing articles is quite small; and second, the starting tariff for offences involving 1,000 infringing articles or more would be a sentence of twelve months' imprisonment and upwards. In upholding this sentence, the Chief Justice expressed his approbation for such a stiff sentencing policy. In his view, this would be consistent with the Government's \"strong efforts to promote Singapore as a regional intellectual property centre and the concomitant need to clamp down on piracy of intellectual property.\" 75 The new law criminalising \"significant and wilful\" infringements of copyright, which came into force on January 1, 2005, has already been invoked to prosecute businesses for using unlicensed software, 76 and individuals for distributing hundreds of pirated digital music files via the Internet. 77 As mentioned in the Introduction, Singapore is now amongst the top twenty-five countries in the world with the lowest software piracy rates. 78 Enforcement of IP rights via civil litigation is not very prevalent in Singapore, as the small numbers of reported judgments set out in the Figure 4 (Appendix) show. These numbers reflect in part the smallness of Singapore; even today, she only has a population of 4.6 million. Further, some cases alleging infringement of IP rights are resolved by mediation or arbitration. For example, a high-profile IP dispute that erupted in 1999 between Singapore Airlines (SIA) and British Airways (BA), in which BA alleged that SIA's first-class seat-beds infringed patents held by BA, was amicably settled after two days of settlement talks mediated by a retired judge at the Singapore Mediation Centre. 79 Settling disputes via alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is a reflection of the Asian values still held within Singapore, in spite of her highly industrialised economy. 80 Although the number of IP cases may not be large, as the IP infrastructure of Singapore has become more sophisticated, so has the nature of these cases. In the first years of the new millennium, the IP cases involved more complicated facts and issues. For example, there was a case involving a patent relating to the HIV-2 virus, 81 and another involving a patent relating to the \"ThumbDrive\"-a unitary storage device that is inserted into any universal serial bus (USB) socket, thereby becoming fully integrated with a PC or laptop. 82 Many would be familiar with the \"ThumbDrive,\" but few would know that it is the subject matter of a patent registered by a Singapore company.",

This could in part be due to Government's promotion of IP as essential to economic survival. For example, according to a recent study of the Singapore consumer's piracy-related behaviour (e.g., in downloading pirated music or movies), 57% of the respondents believe that Singapore's economy would suffer if everyone continued to buy pirated CDs or download illegally. 83 This could also be due to the public's respect for IP based on the \"just rewards\" theory. Thus, in the study just mentioned, 82% of the respondents agreed that \"people deserve to have their creations protected by intellectual property rights.\" Another reason Singapore has been able to accomplish long-range objectives is Singapore's exceptional political stability. The People's Action Party (PAP) has been the ruling party since the beginning of nationhood (1965), and it enjoys an overwhelming majority: there are only two opposition members in the entire 84member Parliament.

Singapore's actual attainment of these goals certainly fuels this belief. From an economic perspective, the fruits of adopting a First World level of IP protection were almost immediate: soon after the signing of the U.S.-Singapore FTA, the big players who set up their development centres in Singapore in 2004-2005 included Lucasfilm (owned by George Lucas of Star Wars fame), Koei (a leading Japanese games company renowned for its Chinese and Japanese medieval action and strategy games), Motorola, Dell Computers, Novartis, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline. It would be very na\u00efve, though, to attribute Singapore's economic success solely (or even primarily) to a strong IP infrastructure. For example, when Lucasfilm announced its decision in 2004 to set up a digital animation studio in Singapore, while it cited Singapore's commitment to protect IP as a reason for choosing Singapore as its first place of venture outside of the United States, other reasons given were Singapore's education system, cosmopolitan environment, and pro-business policies. 89 In other words, a strong IP infrastructure is a very important factor but certainly not a sufficient factor to pull in FDI. 90 Externally, Singapore also gained some mileage in the international IP platform. In March 2006, the first WIPO diplomatic conference in Asia was held in Singapore, a conference which gave birth to the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks. The influence of Singapore in shaping IP law in the international arena may be seen from the fact that the judgment of a Singapore judge, Justice Andrew Phang (who is now a Justice of Appeal), in a trademark case involving shape marks was recently cited with approval and followed by the South African Supreme Court of Appeal. 91 What, then, is the impact of a strong IP regime on innovation amongst indigenous firms? It is generally believed that strong IP rights favour the incumbent MNCs in a country and disfavour independent development of technology by indigenous firms.

In the case of Canada, the validity of its \"Bolar\" exception was challenged by the European Community (E.C.) on the basis that it contravened the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement.

It is absurd for critics to suggest in the 1990s that had we grown our own entrepreneurs we would have been less at the mercy of the rootless MNCs.\" Id. at 85-86.12  The unemployment rate in 1978 had fallen to 3.6%. 13 References to this \"Second Industrial Revolution\" as the aim for the 1980s may be found in speeches made during Parliament sittings.See, e.g., Debate on the President's Address, HAN--Copyright protection under the U.K. Copyright Act 1911, a piece of imperial legislation decreed by King George V for \"His Majesty's dominions,\" modified by the Copyright Act 1914 for application to Singapore, 14 and supplemented by the Copyright (Gramophone Records and Government Broadcasting) Act 1968. -Patent protection under the Registration of U.K. Patent Act 1937, for U.K. patents which had been re-registered with the Registry of Patents in Singapore, supplemented by the Patents (Compulsory Licensing) Act 1969. -Design protection under the Registration of U.K. Designs Act 1938, for U.K.registered designs (without any need of re-registration in Singapore). -Trademark protection under the Trade Marks Act 1939 (almost identical to the U.K. Trade Marks Act 1938), for trademarks registered with the Registry of Trade Marks in Singapore. -Trademark protection in an action for passing off, 15 for unregistered trademarks.",
