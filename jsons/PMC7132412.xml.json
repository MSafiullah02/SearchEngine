Possible causes are deconditioning [2], impaired pulmonary function, impaired cardiac function, cardiac arrhythmia, thyroid dysfunction, anaemia, autonomic dysfunction [3] and anxiety state. This prospective cross-sectional cohort study was conducted to assess the extent of tachycardia and identify possible cause for it.",
