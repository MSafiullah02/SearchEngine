Holub (marsh clubmoss) is a rare herbaceous lycopod (Garcia Criado et al. 2017) found in nutrient-poor wet habitats across the Northern Hemisphere (Hultan and Fries 1986) . In Britain and Europe, L. inundata associates with seasonally inundated heathland vegetation (Byfield and Stewart 2008) , often along tracks and at the edges of oligotrophic lakes (Smyth et al. 2015; Korzeniak and Onete 2016; Price 2019) . The plant's spore-driven life history alternates between two generations -gametophytic and sporophytic. The sporophyte's mature strobili produce spores in the late summer, resulting in diminutive gametophytes from late summer to spring. The rhizomatous stems spread mainly by creeping axes which can also successfully reproduce through vegetative fragmentation (Byfield and Stewart 2008) . Dry hot summers and freezing winter temperatures influence both the degree to which the stem will die back above ground and/or continue to produce new roots below ground. However, the extent and necessity for fungal symbiosis in mature wild populations of L. inundata is unknown.",

There have been only a few reports specifically studying FRE colonization during a plant's growth season (Thippayarugs et al. 1999; Fuchs and Haselwandter 2004; Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2018) . Thus, by examining roots in the beginning of the growth season (spring) and six months later at the end (autumn) we aim to address the question of seasonality. We hypothesized that there are distinct seasonal patterns in FRE on a par with phenological developments in the host plant as well as differences between sites based on local climate variations. Moreover, by studying FRE phenology in the roots of this ancient plant lineage, we can gain further insight into abiotic and environmental drivers of this important fungal group. We also aim to begin isolating factors affecting retention of contracting L. inundata populations, informing conservation and restoration plans.",

However, their ecological role for plant-host fungal preference has not been definitely determined (Mishra et al. 2017; Carvalhais et al. 2019 ). Although we did not compare root colonization cover per root among all 11 sites, if FRE signalling and development resemble those of AMF, we expect the extent of reciprocal nutrient exchange (Smith and Smith 2011), e.g. if correlated with the percentage of the roots colonised at any one time, to be governed locally by host-plant P (Karandashov and Bucher 2005 , Smith et al. 2015 ) and N requirements (Hoysted et al. 2019 . Conversely, the plant may have an excess of photosynthate resources, which it can opportunistically provide to compatible symbionts. This will vary given environmental conditions, competition for surplus resources and 'sink strength' (Walder and van der Heijden 2015) and we expect requirements will certainly shift over the host plant's lifespan (Field et al. 2015b ).",

A recent meta-analysis of temporal changes in AMF and FRE colonization(Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2018a)  found that 75% of the studies detected temporal changes over the growth season. However, the inclusion of FRE as distinguished taxonomically from AMF was not clear.In the single previous mycorrhizal phenology study including L. inundata, more colonization was found in the spring than autumn (Fuchs and Haselwandter 2004), in sharp contradiction to our results. The explanation for this different result is not clear to us but it may relate to a small sample group fortuitously biasing the results, lack of separation between FRE from AMF during analysis, and/or lack of molecular identification of fungi.In a single-site experiment examining fungal colonization of four forb species (Polygonum bistortoides, Gentiana algida, Artemisia scopulorum and Geum rossii) over a three-month alpine growing season,Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2018a)    demonstrated colonization (potentially of FRE, as well as AMF and dark septate endophytes) peaked as the angiosperm fruiting began and AMF vesicles increased as plants produced seeds. Soil temperature and moisture, and plant phenology contributed to root colonization levels, depending on plant species. They also found fungal propagules from the soil colonized new roots within days. The FRE colonization, including vesicles in L. inundata, may also be peaking at the onset of strobilus formation. In fact, all 11 populations had produced strobili by",
