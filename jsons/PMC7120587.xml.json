Recent structural studies of the astrovirus virion using cryo-electron microscopy have yielded important insights into the proteolytic maturation and corresponding conformational changes in the astrovirus virion. Additionally, recent high-resolution X-ray crystallographic studies on human and avian astrovirus capsid spikes have revealed insights into receptor binding, host cell entry, and species specificity. Together, the studies on the astrovirus virion and capsid spike have uncovered striking structural similarities to hepatitis E virus, suggesting that these viruses have a closer phylogenetic relationship than previously recognized. Finally, the high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structure of the astrovirus protease revealed a number of distinctive features that provide insight into its role in nonstructural polyprotein processing events. Overall, astrovirus structural studies provide a foundation for future mutagenesis studies to probe protein functions and roles in the astrovirus life cycle and pathogenesis. Furthermore, these structural studies will have a large impact on the development of antivirals and vaccines targeting astrovirus.",

The capsids of the immature and mature particles are nearly identical at this resolution. The shells are \u223c350 \u00c5 in diameter and \u223c45 \u00c5 thick with features that support organization as T  =  3 icosahedral symmetry, therefore, assembled from 180 protein subunits. They have a solid, chiseled appearance forming triangular plateaus with the edges along the icosahedral twofold axes in close contact (Fig. 3.1, lower). There are depressions at the fivefold and threefold symmetry axes and a groove across the local twofold axes. The highly conserved N-terminal domain has a predicted secondary structure that would be homologous to the canonical \u03b2-sandwich fold in many other icosahedral viruses [23]. Therefore, the HAstV capsid shell is attributed to the conserved domain, which primarily comprises VP34 in the mature virions.\n",

Like astrovirus, HEV is a small, nonenveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome size of about 7.2 kb. At present, it is the sole member of the Hepeviridae family. In addition to the cryo-EM reconstruction, \u00adcrystal structures have also been determined for the HEV T  =  1 subviral particles assembled from recombinant proteins [19, 37]. The HEV structural protein has been described by sequential domains: a positively charged N-terminus likely involved in RNA packaging, a conserved \u03b2-sandwich forming the shell (S-domain), two protruding densities (P1- and P2-domains), and a C-terminal region that must be removed for in vitro assembly (the P1- and P2-domains are also referred to as the M- and P-domains, respectively). The T  =  1 crystal structure of HEV allowed detailed modeling of the protein subunits into the T  =  3 cryo-EM map. It was proposed that the capsid is assembled from dimers around the fivefold axes and across the icosahedral twofold axes. HEV using dimers as building blocks is further supported by the requirement for dimerization of the P2-domain for both assembly and host cell interactions [25, 37].\n",

            "text": "Like HEV, the overall structural organization of HAstV polyprotein can be similarly described, with the astrovirus conserved domain corresponding to the arginine-rich and S-domain of HEV, and the variable domain corresponding to the P1-, P2-, and cleaved C-terminal domains of HEV. Sequence alignment of the two viruses has 21, 13, and 14% identity for the S-, P1-, and P2-domains, respectively [14]. The major noticeable difference between the HAstV and HEV structures is that the astrovirus spikes extend to a greater radius than those of HEV, which has more compact spikes and an outer radius of \u223c190 \u00c5 (Fig. 3.2c, arrow). The HEV atomic model docks exceedingly well into the HAstV cryo-EM density maps without any scaling (Fig. 3.2c). The subunit organization of astrovirus can be inferred by analogy, and Dong et al. used the HEV atomic model to build a corresponding model for HAstV [13]. As with HEV, the spike stoichiometry and orientation suggests that they are dimers with contributions from subunits situated on different trimeric facets (Fig. 3.1, lower left). Using the nomenclature of HEV, AB dimers encircle the fivefold axes, while neighboring C subunits form dimers across the icosahedral twofold axes. In the case of HEV, and perhaps more so for HAstV, this arrangement leads to different interactions for the peripentonal dimers versus the dimers on the twofold axes. The spike bases for the twofold dimers are in much closer proximity than those around the fivefold, which are situated at nearly twice the distance across the local twofold groove. Extrapolating further from the HEV structure, it is likely that there is an underlying difference in the hinge angles between these dimers, which may reflect the presence or absence of RNA in close contact on the interior surface [36].",

The reconstruction of the immature, uncleaved particles has 90 globular, or spike, densities. In the reconstruction of the mature particles, however, only the 30 spike densities located at the icosahedral twofold axes remain visible. Trypsin cleavage of the immature particles produces three products: we presume that VP34 forms the capsid shell and the two different C-terminal products, VP27 and VP25, form the surface spikes. Although a first assumption would be that the trypsin cleavage has removed two-thirds of the spikes from the particles, previously published SDS-PAGE gels show that the amount of VP34 present in infectious particles was comparable to that of VP27 and VP25 [4, 27, 33], indicating that most of the VP27 and VP25, although covalently independent, remain associated with the particle. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the stoichiometry of the spikes may be conserved, and trypsin cleavage results in conformational flexibility so that the density is lost upon image averaging.",

            "text": "Proteolytic cleavage is a common mechanism for activation in both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, including influenza virus [21, 24], coronavirus [15], rotavirus [16], reovirus [7], and alphaviruses [32]. A recurrent theme is that cleavage triggers a conformational change in a surface spike or other cell-attachment domain. In the case of rotavirus, the spike is initially completely unstructured, and therefore not observed by image analysis, until trypsin cleavage, at which point the polypeptides form a stable structure [12, 34]. It is possible that for astroviruses, the reverse takes place, and that fairly stable densities visible before cleavage become completely disordered at some positions. When the virus moves into the stomach of its host and is exposed to protease, the two arrangements of the spikes formed by AB and CC capsid protein dimers are likely to present different cleavage sites, giving rise to the two different C-terminal cleavage products, VP27 and VP25. The peripentonal spikes have dimer contributions that must extend nearly twice the distance of those at the icosahedral twofold axes, which may uncover sites for the additional trimming that generate VP25, and VP27 would be comprise the remaining visible spikes. The spikes located on the icosahedral twofolds are likely to be VP27 homodimers, which have restricted movement just like the spikes in \u00adunprocessed capsid and thus can be visualized in a population-averaged reconstruction. There are several potential ways the conformational change could confer infectivity\u2014by exposing the capsid surface, allowing some variable domains to be flexible, or exposure of binding sites.",

Based on primary sequence analysis, it was hypothesized that VP34 builds up the continuous capsid shell, while VP27 and VP25 form the dimeric projections seen in the cryo-EM reconstruction image [14, 23]. In an attempt to express the projection/spike domain, Dong et al. made five constructs containing residues 394\u2013646, 501\u2013658, 415\u2013628, 501\u2013628, and 415\u2013646, respectively [13]. Of these five constructs, only P2415\u2013646 produced soluble proteins in E. coli, presumably because it encompasses an intact spike domain, and its two ends both terminate in flexible domain linkers. Considering that the N-terminal ends of VP27 and VP25 start from Gln394 and Ser424, respectively [27], P2415\u2013646 is a little longer than VP25 but a bit shorter than VP27 at the N-terminus. P2415\u2013646 exists as a dimer in solution as judged by gel filtration chromatography [13].",

Therefore, the dimer interaction mediated by the projection domain is likely to play an important role in stabilizing the viral capsid. Because the astrovirus projection domain is connected to the capsid shell at its N-terminus, the thinner end of the projection dimer (where both the N- and C-termini are located) should directly abut the capsid outer surface, whereas the opposite, flat end would point away from the capsid (Fig. 3.3a).

In particular, two L3 loops from the two subunits of a dimer reach over to the opposing subunit like two crossing arms, making extensive interactions along their entire length. Sitting on top of the projection domain dimer, L3 also makes close contacts with the L1 and L4 loops from both subunits. A total of 51 residues from each subunit are observed at the dimer interface, among which 29 of the residues are highly conserved. Among the nonconserved interface residues, 12 residues interact with the other subunit via backbone atoms. Except the protruding L3 loop, residues at the dimer interface create a nearly flat surface in between the two molecules that is mostly hydrophobic in nature. The protruding L3 loop, however, contains mostly polar/charged residues and thus predominantly makes hydrogen bonds at the dimer interface. For example, 20 of the 26 intermolecular hydrogen bonds involve residues from the protruding L3 loop. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds are mediated by either main-chain atoms or side-chain atoms of highly conserved residues (i.e., Gln450, Tyr555, Arg558, and Arg572). The highly conserved nature of these inter-subunit hydrogen bonds indicates an important functional role and suggests that they may determine the specificity of dimer interaction.",

Aligning the human astrovirus P2415\u2013646 domain of serotype 8 to that of the other seven serotypes gave pairwise percentage identities ranging from 47% to 57%. It is likely that all human astroviruses use a common receptor for cell internalization, even different astrovirus serotypes might use different cell surface molecules for initial attachment [9]. By calculating the amino acid conservation scores for the P2 domain using the sequences of all eight human astrovirus serotypes, several conserved regions were observed [13]. The most interesting one, which was called the P-site, is located in a shallow groove on top of the P2 spike (Fig. 3.4). This region has a large number of conserved residues (Lys455, Ser 554, Thr575, and Glu610 strictly conserved in all eight serotypes), all with their side chains exposed to solvent. The location of this site also makes it highly accessible to cell receptors without steric hindrance. Another conserved surface patch, the S-site, is located on the side of the P2 spike. This site contains three strictly conserved aromatic residues (Tyr475, Trp604, and Trp606), but two of these (Trp604 and Trp606) have their side chains tucked inside and thus may have been retained for the folding of the protein rather than for ligand recognition. Interestingly, an exposed \u03b2-turn (Thr529\u2013Asn530\u2013Asn531\u2013Arg532) between strands \u03b26 and \u03b27 is also well conserved. This \u03b2-turn and its adjacent regions have the highest B-factors among the entire structure.\n",

Further molecular modeling and docking indicate that the P-site may be able to accommodate a di- or trisaccharide moiety.

The structure of each HEV CP contains three domains, S, P1, and P2. The S domain adopts a typical jelly-roll \u03b2-barrel fold commonly found in other positive-stranded RNA viruses. The P1 domain has a structure of six-stranded \u03b2-barrel decorated with four short \u03b1-helices [19, 37]. The HEV CP P2 domain makes up the dimeric spikes on the viral surface and is responsible for receptor binding and antigenicity determination. The structural alignment generated by the DALI server shows that the HEV capsid P2 domain [19, 25, 37] has a core six-stranded \u03b2-barrel structure similar that of the astrovirus P2415\u2013646 (Fig. 3.5).

Third, there are two extra \u03b2-hairpin insertions in astrovirus, one between \u03b21 and \u03b24 and the other between \u03b27 and \u03b210. Fourth, \u03b26, \u03b27, and \u03b210 in astrovirus CP are much longer than their counterparts in HEV P2. In astrovirus, these three \u03b2-strands form a small protruding knob on each side of the surface spikes. Because of these insertions and also because of its longer \u03b2-strands, the astrovirus P2 domain is substantially larger in size compared to the HEV P2 (232 vs. 143 residues), which could account for the extended radius of the HAstV spikes (Fig. 3.2).",

Therefore, the inclination angle of the \u03b2-barrel with respect to the icosahedral twofold symmetry axis must be similar in astrovirus and HEV, but the azimuthal rotation of the dimeric spike about the icosahedral twofold axis is rather different in these two viruses.

On the other hand, the caliciviruses, another group of small, nonenveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses, also have dimeric surface spikes. According to Dali, calicivirus CP is also related to astrovirus CP in its overall \u00adstructural fold, but the level of similarity is significantly less than that for HEV (Z  =  1.7 vs. Z  =  3.9). In addition, the domain organization of the calicivirus CP is different compared to that of astrovirus and HEV CP. While the three domains of the HEV CP are organized in a linear fashion, the polypeptide of the calicivirus CP winds through the three domains in the order of S  \u2192  P1  \u2192  P2  \u2192  P1 [29]. Therefore, the surface spike of calicivirus is formed effectively by a polypeptide insertion in the P1 domain. In contrast, the spike of both HEV and astrovirus is situated on the CP polypeptide after the P1 domain (Fig. 3.6a). Based on these observations, astrovirus is likely to have more distant phylogenetic relationship to calicivirus compared to HEV, at least when the viral CPs are used for analysis.\n",

In particular, residues 82\u2013266 and 267\u2013407 of the human astrovirus (serotype 8) CP were matched to the S (aa118\u2013313) and P1 (aa314\u2013453) domains of the HEV CP, respectively. Based on this alignment, a homology model of the human astrovirus CP was created with the HEV CP structure as a template [13] (Fig. 3.6). By aligning the S and P1 domains of the astrovirus CP model onto the three quasi-equivalent HEV CP molecules from the T  =  3 EM model [36], a T  =  3 astrovirus capsid \u00adstructure was generated [13]. The astrovirus capsid model closely resembles the cryo-EM reconstruction of astrovirus in terms of particle diameter and the capsid landscape variation. The close resemblance of the two structures further confirms the notion that astroviruses are phylogenetically related to HEV.",

The N-terminal end of VP27 and VP25 starts from Gln394 and Ser424, respectively [27]. Based on the astrovirus capsid model, the N-terminal cleavage site of VP27 (Gln394) was mapped to the unstructured loop right before the last \u03b2-strand in the P1 domain. Therefore, VP27 should be able to remain associated with the viral particle through main-chain H-bonds mediated by this last \u03b2-strand in the P1 domain. The N-terminal cleavage site of VP25, however, is located in an extended linker (the P1\u2013P2 linker) between the P1 and the P2 domain.

Although this particular sequence is not conserved in all astroviruses, they all contain potential caspase cleavage sequences within amino acids 650\u2013700 of their CP polypeptides. Because HEV assembly has only been achieved in vitro with the deletion of \u223c50 C-terminal amino acids, HEV may have a similar cleavage requirement for particle release.

Second, the active site residue Asp489 is oriented away from His461 and does not form the hydrogen bond normally seen in \u00adtrypsin-like proteases. Instead, a water molecule forms the hydrogen bond. The authors note that Asp489 likely undergoes a conformational change during substrate binding, as seen in hepatitis A virus protease [6, 38], although the authors do not rule out the possibility of an atypical catalytic mechanism. Last, the astrovirus protease substrate binding pocket S1 is more shallow than other viral proteases and has a positive electrostatic potential. Consistent with this structural observation, hydrolytic activity assays show that the astrovirus protease S1 pocket has specificity for negatively charged Asp and Glu residues. Furthermore, the hydrolytic activity is dependent on a functional astrovirus protease active site because the Ser551Ala mutant was inactive.",

First, a \u223c125aa C-terminal domain of the viral CP is removed by host caspase following assembly. The exact function of this C-terminal domain is not known but it may facilitate the sorting/trafficking of the viral CP to promote assembly. Additionally, extensive extracellular protease processing of the viral capsid is required for virus infectivity and maturation, which is rather unusual for small, positive-sense RNA viruses. In this chapter, we have primarily focused our discussion on the cryo-EM reconstructions of the immature and mature astrovirus, the crystal structures of the human astrovirus and turkey astrovirus capsid spikes, and the crystal structure of the human astrovirus protease. Altogether, these new findings have led a better understanding of many facets of the astrovirus replication, including astrovirus assembly, virus release, maturation, receptor binding, antibody neutralization, and nonstructural polyprotein processing. Of course, these findings would not be possible without many years of pioneering virological work that is not fully discussed here. We also realize that the ultimate understanding of the astrovirus assembly and maturation will require further characterization of the viral capsid/capsid proteins by structural as well as biochemical, genetic, and cell biology approaches.",

Unlike HEV, which is known to encode both methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities within the 5\u2032 half of its ORF1, no capping enzymes have been identified in the astrovirus nonstructural proteins. Only three enzymes, the viral protease, a viral polymerase, and a putative helicase, have been found in the astrovirus genome. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the astrovirus genome might encode a VPg with sequence similar to the VPgs from Caliciviridae and Potyviridae [1]. We expect that further studies on astrovirus and other small, nonenveloped RNA viruses, both on their capsid and their replication, would help to establish their phylogenetic relationships, which, in turn, would greatly facilitate further structural and functional characterization of these viruses.",
