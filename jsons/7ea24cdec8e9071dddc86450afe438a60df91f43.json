Surface erythrocyte binding and agglutination were seen when diphtheria and tetanus portions of the vaccine were added to erythrocytes from healthy people and patients with vaccine-associated IMHA.I2 Immunoglobulins eluted off erythrocytes from these patients had antigen specificity for the various components of the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine.I2 These findings may support an immune-mediated model, with antibodies formed against erythrocyte membrane-attached vaccine components. In a guinea pig model of IMHA, antibody-coated erythrocyte removal from the circulation was markedly accelerated when the guinea pig's immune system was previously stimulated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin.\" This evidence suggests that immune stimulation and macrophage activation, such as might be induced by vaccination, could exacerbate pre-existing IMHA. It is not known whether the vaccine components induced autoantibody production in the dogs in this study, or whether the macrophages or the immune system were activated by vaccination to destroy red blood cells with pre-existing antibodies on the erythrocyte surface. In drug-induced IMHA, drugs can induce autoantibodies, or can induce antibody production against red blood cells that may require the involvement of the drug in the antibody-erythrocyte binding.3',i4 Although vaccine components are given in small quantities, they contain relatively large amounts of immune reactive antigens and other components that may remain in the body for extended periods of time. Therefore, vaccination can elicit an immune response days to weeks after inoculation. Drug-induced IMHA resolves with drug withdrawal and has a good Vaccine-associated IMHA, in contrast, has a mortality rate and clinical course more closely resembling idiopathic IMHA. 4 The vaccines reported in this study are commonly used canine vaccines (DHLPP, rabies, Borrelia, Bordetella, and coronavirus). They included modified-live viruses, killed viruses, and killed bacterins. Any of these components, as well as the adjuvants used in these vaccines, may stimulate or disrupt the function of the immune system or elicit increased antibody production that could lead to IMHA. Each year hundreds of thousands of dogs are vaccinated with these products. The overall adverse reaction rate reported by manufacturers for canine vaccines is approximately 0.002%. Estimates from the vaccine manufacturers suggest that less than 5 % of these reactions involve immune-mediated disease such as IMHA (personal communications: Hall J, Fort Dodge Animal Health Corp, 1995; Klink B, Rhone Merieux Inc, 1995) . This would place the reported prevalence of vaccineinduced IMHA at less than 0.0001% or 1 per 1 million vaccinated dogs. However, because not all cases are reported to the manufacturers (none of the cases in this retrospective study had been reported) and the association between IMHA and recent vaccination may not have been considered in clinical practice, the prevalence of vaccine-associated IMHA is likely to be underestimated.
