The goals of these human studies were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune potency of the platform. Diverse DNA vaccines for a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic applications were studied, including HIV-1,37 influenza, cancer antigens, hepatitis B, malaria,38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and others.43 Although the initial DNA vaccine studies in humans demonstrated excellent tolerability and safety,15, 43 the immune responses they elicited were much weaker than expected based on the preclinical data. Concerns about the ability of the technology to stimulate robust immune responses led to the development of the prime-boost strategy which sought to take advantage of properties of both DNA as well as recombinant viral vectors when combined resulting in focused immunity to the transgene (see below).44\n",

They reported that DNA priming followed by recombinant poxviral boosting resulted in superior CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity than poxviral vaccination alone. A follow-up study by these same investigators compared the data from an HIV gp120 env protein vaccination protocol where the protein vaccine was administered three times (group 1) versus a second group (group 2) which received four administrations of the immunizations with the HIV poxviral vector followed by two administrations of the HIV protein vaccination, versus a group (group 3) which received three administrations of the immunizations with an HIV env-encoding plasmid vaccine followed by boosting with gp120 protein twice.66 The studies reported significant antibody response differences in the three arms. Group 2 exhibited the lowest neutralizing antibody titers, but a high level of binding antibody responses. Group 1 exhibited high neutralizing titer antibodies as did group 3. Interesting, the DNA prime\u2013protein boost group (group 3) exhibited the highest level of broadly neutralizing titers observed suggesting a unique benefit of the DNA prime in the context of protein boosting.",

The VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP vaccine consisted of a four-construct mixture of plasmids encoding subtype B Gag-Pol-Nef fusion protein and three modified Env constructs from subtypes A, B, and C. Plasmid doses of 4 or 8 mg were studied but these appeared similar. The adenoviral vectors were delivered at 1010 particle units (PU) in a 1-mL volume, in the deltoid and as a single immunization in the prime-boost study. They observed that while each platform was capable of inducing immune responses as a standalone platform,55, 67, 68 when the platforms were combined (DNA prime administered three times followed by Ad5 boost) improved immunogenicity was observed. The sequential DNA/rAd5 administration resulted in 7-fold higher magnitude Env-biased HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and 100-fold greater antibody binding titers measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.",

A focused Phase II study evaluated the regimen of an HIV-1 DNA prime followed by a rAd5 boost, to prevent infection or to reduce viral loads in study participants who became naturally infected after vaccination.75 This study was designed after an earlier study entitled STEP, which tested an rAd5 vector that encoded gag pol and nef antigens of HIV. The STEP trial was ended early because of futility and a possible concern that persons in the vaccine arm acquired HIV infection more often than those in the control arm. The new trial was specifically designed to avoid potential risks observed in the STEP study, such as inclusion of env antigens in the 505 study as part of the vaccine. However, this trial also ended early because of futility,76 supporting the conclusion that this prime-boost approach with these vaccine platforms was not effective. It has been speculated that rAd5 may not be the best genetic vaccine platform for HIV as its strong immune cell activation may work against the vaccine during HIV field challenge. An outcome of this study is a shift to other nonhuman adenoviral vectors, such as chimpanzee adenoviral vectors.77 Overall, the prime boost strategy continues to have a central role in many vaccine efforts targeting diverse difficult pathogens, but as illustrated above, many challenges remain, and there is a major interest in further improving the immune potency of these approaches.",

An important consideration for increasing plasmid-driven immune potency involves sequence optimization.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 96 Bacterial RNA is rich in AU sequences, whereas mammalian DNA is rich in GC. Therefore, the pool of transfer RNAs needed for translation in human cells is favored for sequences enriched in GC. Because of the redundancy in codon usage, unique transcriptional differences exist between bacteria, diverse viruses, parasites, and even host tumor antigens, which may benefit from attention to genetic design. DNA sequences can be codon-optimized to favor the transfer RNA pools available in human cells, allowing the encoded messenger RNA (mRNA) to be more efficiently translated.",

For example, sequences rich in GC are more likely to form secondary structures and slow translation, lowering in vivo protein production. RNA optimization also involves removing internal cis-acting motifs such as TATA boxes, repeat sequences that can cause instability, cryptic splice sites, and unwanted ribosomal binding sites. A combination of these and other gene optimization strategies can have a dramatic positive effect on protein expression and vaccine immunogenicity.110, 111, 112 A recent study of a West Nile virus vaccine DNA using an improved promoter induced relevant antibody responses in most of the 30 trial participants.113 This study extended the findings reported in trials of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Ebola plasmid vaccines, which resulted in low but positive serology induced by the vaccine, with however low T-cell responses suggesting more improvement is still important for this platform to be stand alone.114, 115\n",

            "text": "A major advantage of the DNA platform is the ability to rapidly customize the vaccine antigens with high precision to address specific vaccine design limitations. For example, the diversity in HIV's Env sequence can reach greater than 15% within a subtype and greater than 30% between clades. Similar diversity issues plague influenza, hepatitis C virus, and malaria vaccine development, among others. Therefore, vaccination with a single viral sequence is unlikely to drive the diversity of responses necessary for cross-protection from the variety of sequences circulating in the population. Approaches to overcome these limitations combine computer predictions for immunogen design with synthetic chemistry to generate vaccine antigens that improve on nature. Important approaches include consensus antigen, ancestor gene, and center-of-tree designs116, 117, 118, 119; mosaic antigens120, 121, 122; and epitope string approaches.123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128 All these approaches seek to focus the immune response induced by a synthetic gene cassette to specific epitopes or regions of a native antigen or an antigen predicted by computer analysis to be more conserved or invariant in the population of divergent viruses. Such targeting would, in theory, preferentially expand the most desired T- and B-cell responses that nature would not drive. These strategies seek to maximize cross-reactivity of the T-cell responses induced against divergent strains of the pathogen. Consensus antigens, mosaic antigens, and epitope strings are currently being studied in the clinic for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV, among others. Data from HIV as well as human papillomavirus (HPV) are discussed further below.",

Early studies in humans used doses of 1 mg or less but newer studies use doses of 8 mg, which increase the consistency and frequency of antibody production.114 Formulations with doses as high as 12 mg, together with cytokine expression vectors and electroporation, have stimulated increased T-cell responses143 and are promising approaches.",

An important area for DNA delivery is the formulation of DNA into or on biodegradable polymeric microparticles (see a review105) as well as contained in liposomes.97, 101, 108 Microparticle- and liposome-based DNA vaccine delivery systems are being studied for their utility of delivery and enhanced immunogenicity in several different host and antigenic vaccine platforms in small animals,99, 100, 103, 106 NHPs97, 104 and in humans in cytomegalovirus (CMV) and influenza DNA vaccines. These compounds can have dual roles, facilitating plasmid entry into the cell as well as providing an adjuvant effect. Polyethyleneimine, amine-functionalized polymethacrylates, cationic poly (\u03b2-amino) esters, poloxamers, and polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers are additional examples of molecules that can enhance DNA vaccine immune potency in specific systems.103, 106 The poloxamer CRL1005 has demonstrated improved immune potency in preclinical models for simian HIV vaccines.97, 108 In addition, ongoing studies show that liposome vehicles can improve DNA vaccine-induced immune responses. Studies with liposomes, in general, support an improved, but still modest, impact on antibody responses and lesser impact on T-cell responses. As liposomes have structural versatility with regard to the resulting vesicle surface charge (both cationic and anionic liposomes can be made), size, lipid content, and codelivery with other adjuvants, they offer the ability to be customized for specific DNA applications.99, 100, 103, 104, 105, 106\n",

The major limitations to clinical use of jet injection are the requirement for large amounts of DNA and the DNA degradation from the high-pressure delivery. However, it is a relatively simple technique that has shown improved immune responses when compared with IM injection in experimental model systems. The gene gun uses high pressure to deliver DNA-coated gold nanoparticles to the dermis and has demonstrated high transfection efficiency and enhanced antibody responses in several species including humans.152, 153 In contrast, it has had relatively little effect on improving cellular immunity.",

            "text": "Electroporation (EP) has been used to transfect cells in vitro for 3 decades and has more recently been used in vivo to increase the transfection efficiency of DNA vaccines.17 EP involves applying a small electric field across the site of injection to cause temporary membrane instability and create an electric gradient, which increases plasmid uptake by cells in the field.18, 24 This technique has been studied for 2 decades as a method to improve delivery of chemotherapy drugs to kill specific tumor cells147, 148, 149 and in several animal species (e.g., dogs, pigs, cattle, NHPs) to deliver genes that encode a variety of hormones, cytokines, enzymes, or antigens.146, 150, 151, 152, 156 However, the conditions required for EP were initially considered too harsh for adoption into vaccination strategies. Yet, over the past 10 years, EP technology has developed more benign delivery devices that are computer controlled and capable of enhancing delivery through IM, ID, and microneedle transfection.20, 21 These approaches use lower voltage and are more tolerable. An exciting development is that in large-animal models, delivery of DNA vaccine by EP has led to both increased cellular and humoral immune responses,22, 23 rivaling those seen with viral vectors.157 When these newer EP approaches are combined with other DNA optimization approaches, the magnitude of the immune responses generated by the combined DNA approach has increased more than a log.110, 156, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164 EP technology can also be tailored to a particular DNA vaccine, using devices that control current, voltage, and timing settings. Combinations with molecular adjuvants also look highly promising,136, 165, 166 and delivery to the skin, muscle, and the mucosal has been reported. Data from multiple primate challenge models have demonstrated much improved immunogenicity and efficacy against challenge by such delivery of plasmid vaccines.167, 168\n",

The use of plasmid DNA for in vivo antigen production and mRNA to deliver encoded antigens was first reported more than 2 decades ago.170, 171 Initially, DNA vaccines took center stage because of their ease of production and stability but problems with immunogenicity were soon appreciated. However, RNA-based approaches have reemerged as an important genetic vaccine platform. RNA-based vaccine approaches allow for infinite boosting because they are not subject to neutralization by the host immune response, even in previously seropositive individuals. RNA vaccines are produced, customized in vivo, and processed by the host. They are naturally folded and can be further modified by the endogenous host cell systems. Similar to DNA vaccine approaches the antigens produced in vivo can be presented on endogenous APC and stimulate both CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, mimicking the immune responses induced by live infection. Mixtures of RNAs were also tested.172 However, similar to the poor immunogenicity seen with DNA vaccines, the early studies using RNA vaccines were also plagued by low immunogenicity in small animals, as well as manufacturing issues resulting in low production yields and product instability.",

Based on these data, there was interest in cancer immune therapy using patient-derived cells, which are modified by transfecting them with either mRNA derived from their own cancer cells or antigen-specific synthesized mRNA to focus the immune response. These approaches were tested in pancreatic cancer, neuroblastoma, melanoma, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer, among others. The early studies were well tolerated. Additionally, RNA-based approaches are being investigated for delivery of chimeric T-cell receptors for functionally targeting tumor antigens directly.175, 176 This ex vivo approach is preferred because of difficulties in RNA production and storage, among other difficulties.",

One advance is the ability to stabilize mRNA during production. The second is the existence of more potent self-amplifying RNA vectors based on the alphavirus platform. In a recent study using a synthetic mRNA encoding influenza antigens, optimized for RNA GC content and complexed with protamine, mice or ferrets vaccinated with this formulation seroconverted to influenza antigens and were protected against influenza challenge178 after a single immunization. The formulation was also immunogenic in animals as large as pigs, and while not fully protective after influenza challenge in pigs, the disease was attenuated. mRNA vaccines are now being tested in humans, with a focus on therapy of cancer, particularly prostatic cancer.179, 180, 181, 182 A prostate cancer mRNA vaccine containing \u201cself-adjuvanted\u201d mRNA encoding antigens of relevance to prostate disease, including prostate specific antigen, prostate stem cell antigen, prostate specific membrane antigen, and six transmembrane epithelial antigens of the prostate, was evaluated for immunogenicity and safety in 44 patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. These mRNA-based vaccines contained free and protamine-complexed mRNA to support the stability and delivery of the mRNA. In mice, the vaccine was immunogenic and suggested that these vaccines drove innate immune stimulation that was mediated in part via Toll-like receptor 7 activation. In clinical studies, the mRNA vaccines were administered with five ID injections at a recommended dose of 1280 \u00b5g. Results showed that immune responses could be detected against at least one vaccine antigen in 26 of 33 evaluable patients, with 15 of 33 patients responding to more than one of the vaccine antigens. Treatment-related adverse events were experienced by 39 (89%) patients, including injection-site erythema and injection-site reactions, fatigue (18%), pyrexia (16%), chills (11%), and influenza-like illness (11%). Although most of these reactions were considered mild in nature, additional safety studies are needed. The outcome results were interesting as the immune responders showed a trend toward increased survival compared to the non-immune responders. There was also a trend to better clinical outcome based on induction of more antigenic responses; patients who responded to three antigens had better outcomes than those who responded to only one or two antigens. Antibody responses induced by the vaccine were not as robust as the T-cell responses as only four of the patients showed increased titers to tested vaccine antigens. Additional studies in the mRNA vaccine area will be important to follow.",

This could be a vector issue as the inclusion of env antigens did not impact positively on efficacy in the 505 trial.

Although both cellular and humoral immune responses contribute to anti-Ad5 immunity, it is likely that the Ad5 neutralizing antibodies play a major role in suppressing rAd5-induced immunogenicity, as seen in humans. This preexisting immunity has been shown to reduce the immunogenicity of Ad vaccines in mice,200, 201 rhesus monkeys,202 and potentially in humans,203, 204 but it is not clear that preexisting immunity in humans will completely block vaccine immunogenicity.",

To develop such vectors, investigators have evaluated rAd vectors from low-seroprevalence human adenoviruses, as well as from NHPs. Recombinant Ad vectors from human serotypes have been well described.215, 216, 217 Seroprevalence of the 51 Ad serotypes suggests that the Ad11 and Ad35 subfamilies, as well as adenoviruses from subfamily D, including Ad26, are uncommon in humans,218 and thus may offer advantages over Ad5 as vectors. Novel vectors based on rAd35 and rAd11 have been developed, and preclinical studies suggest that they are resistant to anti-Ad5 immunity in mice.54, 219 Some of the alternative vectors show less-potent antibody responses than seen with rAd5. There also appear to be regional differences in seropositivity to diverse \u201crare\u201d serotype rAd vectors. For example, although the rAd26 and rAd28 B serotypes have shown promise in early clinical trials and their seroprevalence is low in North America, seropositivity to these viruses approaches 80% in parts of Africa,220, 221 complicating development and regulatory issues for such vectors.",

Finally, recombinant Ad vectors have been developed from alternative species, including sheep, pigs, cows, macaques, and chimpanzees.190, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233 In particular such chimp adenoviral vectors appear to be gaining traction for clinical evaluation. Specifically, the Ad5 Ebola vaccine was superseded by a new chimp adenoviral vaccine.234 A chimpanzee-derived replication-defective adenovirus (chAd) vaccine induced uniform protection against acute lethal Ebolavirus challenge in macaques. However, the protection was short lived. When chAd3 was boosted with a MVA Ebola vaccine, much more durable protection against lethal Ebolavirus challenge was generated. In human studies, the vaccine induced antibody responses were detected in 68% of vaccine recipients in the highest dose group studied (5\u00d710\u221210vp) with 100% of vaccinated persons responding in ELISPOT assays.235 Overall, the data were encouraging. Surprisingly, preexisting neutralizing antibodies were observed against chimp adenoviral vectors in sub-Saharan Africa suggesting that at some level chimp adenoviruses or related viruses have crossed into the human population with some frequency. This finding has consequences beyond HIV vaccines as the chAd3-EBO-Z viral vaccine developed by the NIH is among the important new vaccine candidates being studied in the context of the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The impact of preexisting immunity on this vaccine or others being developed will require additional investigation.235, 236\n",

Polyvalent recombinants have been used to immunize experimental animals and have proved useful in a variety of infectious disease models, including rabies, measles, SIV, canine distemper, respiratory syncytial virus, malaria,57, 252 and influenza.253 In addition, these vectors have been studied in a variety of HIV challenge models in animals. Human studies have also been conducted 45, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258 with vaccinia,259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267 NYVAC,268, 269, 270, 271 and ALVAC,268, 269, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276 and have advanced into efficacy studies in humans. The ALVAC-EnvGag/Pol (clade B and AE) was evaluated in combination with gp120 protein boosting in a Phase III study in Thailand and demonstrated a 31% reduction in the frequency of acquisition of HIV infection among vaccinated heterosexual men and women when compared with placebo recipients.277 This study represented a landmark trial, providing a proof of concept that a vaccine could prevent HIV-1 infection, although the degree of efficacy was modest. Although attenuated poxvectors have been evaluated in a variety of human studies, it is clear that developing these vaccines for use in humans has been challenging. In part, because the recombinant transgenes represent a small minority of gene products expressed in this otherwise large vector. Thus, there is no certainty that the immune response will be focused to the foreign transgene rather than to gene products synthesized endogenously by the poxvirus. In addition, as seen with rAd, antivector immunity remains problematic, although to a lesser degree with canarypox vectors.",

However, the difficulties in manufacturing virus in high yields from primary CEFs, as well as their antigenic complexity, reactogenicity and poor immunogenicity, possibly impacts their effect in multiple immunization regimens. A poxviral vaccine was tested in a human malaria challenge model.278 The vaccine expressed a polyprotein insert which consisted of a string of six preerythrocytic antigens designed from Plasmodium falciparum. Following safety assessment of single doses, 15 volunteers received a heterologous prime-boost vaccination regime involving two difference poxvirus malaria subunit vaccines containing the insert, FP9-PP and MVA-PP. Following immunization the subjects underwent malaria sporozoite challenge. The vaccines were safe; however, T-cell interferon-\u03b3 ELISPOT responses were low and there was no vaccine efficacy observed. A novel MVA vaccine expressing the antigen 85A of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated in a placebo-controlled Phase IIb trial in South Africa in infants.279 Infants who had previously received bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination were randomized to receive either the MVA85A or placebo intradermally and then followed for immune responses and protection against tuberculosis. Although the vaccine was safe and the immunogenicity was modest, there was no efficacy against tuberculosis infection or disease. Both of these studies with malaria and tuberculosis suggest that much more potent immune responses will be needed to impact these two infections. Thus, prime-boost strategies are being pursued.",

In these studies, T cells have been induced; however, the poxviral vectors appear to induce modest antibody responses. The first positive efficacy outcome has been reported in a Phase IIb study using a recombinant poxviral vector. Prostvac-V/F is a candidate, anticancer immunotherapy for therapy of prostate cancer which was originally championed by the National Cancer Institute. It was developed for men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Therapy consists of priming with a vaccinia recombinant poxviral vector followed by up to five monthly immunizations with a fowlpox vector. The vectors contain the identical gene inserts. The inserts include a gene sequence encoding a modified immune stimulatory prostate-specific antigen cassette along with additional gene cassettes for three human immunostimulatory molecules (known as TRICOM), leukocyte function\u2013associated antigen-3, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and B7.1. In clinical trials, the treatment generated clear anti\u2013prostate-specific antigen CTL responses in up to 57% of vaccinees, but almost no antibody responses.281 These CTLs were shown to have the ability to lyse tumor targets.282 In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase II clinical trial (NCT00078585), Prostvac-V/F increased overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer by 8.5 months which translated to a 44% reduction in risk of death.283 Bavarian Nordic in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute is currently testing Prostvac with or without a GM-CSF adjuvant in a global, double-blind, randomized, Phase III efficacy trial dubbed PROSPECT (NCT01322490). It will be interesting to clinically evaluate this immune therapeutic vaccine in the context of checkpoint inhibitor therapy as well. Further improvement in poxviral immunogenicity remains important.",

In contrast to the large genome sizes of rAd and vaccinia vectors, AAV's genome sizes are much more limited in size, with an insert size of approximately 5 kb. Like other replication-defective viruses, these particles can be produced in packaging lines that provide complementary structural proteins made constitutively by the cell rather than the virus. A variety of serotypes have been defined,284 and an HIV vaccine expressed in AAV2 has been evaluated in Phase I human studies, with poor immunogenicity results. Alternative serotypes, including AAV1, are currently under development and may be assessed both alone and in prime-boost combinations for efficacy in humans. An entirely unique use of these vectors has also been described recently. Recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors have been studied as a platform to deliver recombinant antibody genes for direct in vivo production of antibodies. This strategy, vector immune prophylaxis, allows previously identified rare neutralizing antibodies to be engineered into an Recombinant adeno-associated virus vector, which, upon infection, results in in vivo antibody production of protective antibodies. Vector immune prophylaxis also allows for production of protective antibodies in vivo that have not been achieved with vaccination.285 Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this delivery strategy in protecting NHPs against SIV,285, 286 humanized mice against HIV,287, 288 and mice and ferrets against influenza.289, 290 The first vector immune prophylaxis approach has reached the clinic to inhibit HIV infection. A similar approach has been described using DNA vectors delivered by EP. This DNA monoclonal antibody delivery approach showed in vivo production of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies,291 as well as antibodies that can protect against Dengue challenge.292 Collectively the vector immune prophylaxis and related platforms are clearly exciting, even though they are early and have many hurdles to overcome. They illustrate how gene vectors are revolutionizing the way we think about traditional vaccination for protection against infectious disease.",

A variety of bacteria are able to replicate at mucosal sites of natural infection, and it has been proposed that attenuation of these microorganisms and modification to facilitate the delivery of antigen might allow the development of improved vaccines to protect against pathogens that enter through the mucosa. Development of live bacterial vectors has therefore focused both on their ability to induce mucosal IgA responses and on cytolytic T-cell responses at mucosal sites. The synthesis of proteins in mammalian cells delivered by bacterial vectors has the potential to induce the cellular immunity that is the goal of many gene-based viral and nonviral vaccines. These approaches have been reviewed in detail elsewhere318, 319, 320 and are summarized briefly here.",

In addition, there are commensal strains such as Streptococcus gordonii, lactobacilli, and staphylococci that have been used for the induction of humoral and cellular responses. For gene-based vaccination, L. monocytogenes has been a particular focus of research. This gram-positive intracellular pathogen has been studied as a model for understanding class I MHC-restricted immune responses. These responses are normally seen against the bacterial proteins or coexpressed antigens. This microorganism uses a specialized system to introduce proteins into cells and facilitate processing and presentation through MHC class I, and different mutations have been used to develop attenuated strains that retain the ability to deliver antigens. Similarly, Salmonella bacterial strains are intracellular pathogens that become restricted to the endosomal compartment of eukaryotic cells, where they are resistant to lysis.321 A variety of mutations have been introduced into Salmonella to generate several different live vaccine carriers, and these vaccine prototypes have undergone further development for vaccine delivery. Among the other bacterial carriers, M. bovis Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) has been a widely used bacterial vaccine; for example, this organism has been used to express HIV antigens.322, 323 In some instances, expression of mammalian genes has required modification of codons more consistent with the host cell type, which has improved immunogenicity.18, 324 At present, however, the ability of such microorganisms to induce cellular immunity at levels similar to adenoviral or poxviral vectors in humans is still under investigation.",

Among the concerns is the possibility of reversion or reactogenicity of these potentially pathogenic bacteria to wild-type forms, the stability of the recombinant bacteria, and the possibility that preexisting immunity from exposure to natural pathogens may limit their infectivity. A variety of host genetic factors can modulate the immune response induced by the bacterial carrier, and variability in the innate immune responses to such pathogens may limit their consistency in vivo. Finally, perhaps the most challenging problem has been the ability to effect a gene transfer from bacteria into mammalian cells. It is likely that very specialized transport pathways are required for the successful implementation of this technology, and if additional improvements will be necessary to improve the efficacy of this approach remains to be established in the clinic.",

Until very recently there were no reported successes in human studies for guidance; rather there were several failures that brought into question the potential of the technology. However, this status is rapidly changing. Some of the oldest of the recombinant vector platforms have been in clinical evaluation for close to 2 decades. Several trials using the poxvirus technology have been studied in efficacy trials. These include canarypox, MVA, and NYVAC, which have been evaluated in various Phase I to III human studies. As the production technology for poxviruses is well researched, and good-manufacturing-practice procedures for amplification of these viruses followed protocols similar to those developed for vaccinia virus, the path toward clinical studies appeared relatively straightforward. Over the past 3 decades efficacy data were elusive, but recently there has been some positive news. The \u201cThai\u201d trail of a canarypox vector engineered to carry HIV antigens in which patients were boosted with gp120 antigen provided a possible glimpse of efficacy in a prime-boost platform study, with approximately 31% protection from infection reported.277 Subsequently, the ProstaVac immune therapy efficacy trial using two different poxviral backbones in prime-boost fashion demonstrated overall increased survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer of 8.5 months. These important results are supportive of potential impact of these vectors in other targets in the future. It is also important to remember that studies of recombinant MVA technology have given rise to a potentially safer next-generation vaccine for smallpox.31\n",
