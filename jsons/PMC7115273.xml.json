Relevant books on culture and health were consulted as well. Leaders from the most important religions affiliated with the World Council of Churches (a fellowship of churches associated in an ecumenical movement to promote Christian unity) and the Muslim World League (an Islamic nongovernmental organization that promotes Islamic unity) were individually consulted to gather knowledge regarding the importance of hygiene, hand hygiene, and alcohol prohibition within the precepts and holy texts of their faiths. A total of 2332 articles were retrieved through the Medline search. Many of the articles referred to \u201cculture\u201d in the microbiological sense and had to be eliminated, together with numerous articles restricted to mental health. Of the remaining articles, only 27 referred to cultural and/or religious aspects influencing health, in particular hygiene, hand hygiene practices, and alcohol prohibition according to the most important religions; these were retained for review.",

The attitude toward hand cleansing in more specific opportunities, called \u201celective hand hygiene practice,\u201d more frequently corresponds to the indications for hand hygiene during health care delivery.2, 8 In some populations, both inherent and elective hand hygiene practices may be deeply influenced by cultural and religious factors, although establishing whether a strong inherent attitude toward hand hygiene directly determines an increased elective behavior has proven difficult. Hand hygiene can be practiced for hygienic reasons, for ritualistic reasons during religious ceremonies, and for symbolic reasons in specific everyday life situations (\nTable 1).",

In general, the indications given by Christ's example refer more to spiritual behavior, but the emphasis on this specific viewpoint does not imply that personal hygiene and body care are not important in the Christian way of life. Similarly, the Buddhist faith has no specific indications regarding hand hygiene in daily life or during ritual occasions, apart from the hygienic act of washing hands after each meal.",

In the Sikh culture, as in Mahayana and Tibetan Buddhism, a specific cultural meaning is given to the habit of folding the hands together as a form of greeting, in prayer, or as a mark of respect. Studies have demonstrated the importance of the role of gestures in teaching and learning, and there is certainly a potential advantage to considering this in the teaching of hand hygiene, particularly in its representation in pictorial images for different cultures.19, 20 In multimodal strategies to promote hand hygiene, posters placed in key points in health care settings have proven to be very effective tools for reminding health care workers to cleanse their hands.2, 8, 21 Efforts to consider specific hand uses and gestures according to local customs in visual posters, including education and promotion material, may help convey the intended message more effectively.

Otherwise, rubbing the hands with an alcohol-based formulation is recommended as the preferred practice for all other hand hygiene indications during patient care, because it is faster, more effective, and better tolerated by the skin. But infection control practitioners find it difficult to precisely define the meaning of \u201cvisibly dirty\u201d and to provide practical examples when teaching hand hygiene. From a transcultural perspective, finding a common understanding of this term is even more difficult; for example, a spot of blood or other proteinaceous material is more difficult to see on very dark skin. Furthermore, in a hot and humid climate, the need to wash the hands with fresh water also may be driven by the feeling of sticky or humid skin.",

Nonetheless, in theory, those religions with an alcohol prohibition in everyday life demonstrate a pragmatic vision that allows acceptance of the most valuable approach in the perspective of optimal patient care delivery. Despite this generally tolerant approach, however, the religious background still may influence some health care workers who are unwilling to use alcohol-based formulations due to either reluctance to come in contact with alcohol or concerns about alcohol ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption.8, 26 Even the designation of a product simply as an \u201calcohol-based formulation\u201d could become an obstacle for the implementation of worldwide recommendations.",

Similarly, cocaine is allowed for use as a local anesthetic, but not as a recreational drug.",

Indeed, hand rub dispensers have been installed in numerous health care settings since 2005.26 This experience demonstrates that alcohol-containing hand rub solutions are indeed finally acceptable to many Muslim health care workers, even within an Islamic kingdom legislated by Sharia (Islamic law), and this may encourage other Muslims to reconsider their attitude (Fig 2\n).",

Whereas insignificant levels of ethanol were measured in the breath and serum of a minority of the participants, isopropanol was not detected. Finally, alcohol smell on the skin may be an additional barrier to the use of hand rubs; further product development should be conducted to eliminate this smell from hand rub preparations.",

Results of these discussions could be summarized in an information leaflet to be produced and distributed locally. It has been suggested that in settings in which the observance of related religious norms is very strict, the term \u201calcohol\u201d be avoided in favor of the adjective \u201cantiseptic\u201d when describing hand rubs. But concealing the true nature of the product by using a nonspecific term may be construed by some as deceptive and considered unethical. Further research is needed before any final recommendation along these lines can be made. Finally, the opportunity to involve patients in a multimodal strategy to promote hand hygiene in health care should be carefully evaluated. Despite its potential value, this intervention may be premature in settings in which religious proscriptions are taken literally; rather, it could be a later step, after the achievement of awareness and compliance among health care workers.",
