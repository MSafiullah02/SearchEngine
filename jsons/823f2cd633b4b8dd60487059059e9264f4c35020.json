Early detection is critical for effective management and prevention of outbreaks. Recent research efforts in developing optimized detection systems often focus on rapid methods for analyzing blood or excrement samples; however, these approaches require that individuals are examined in clinical settings, typically after an outbreak has been established. Wastewater-based epidemiology is a promising methodology for early detection of viral outbreaks at a population level. Analyzing wastewater is equivalent to obtaining and analyzing a community excrement sample. In the determination of whether an outbreak is imminent or already in progress, quantifying viral concentration in raw wastewater is a crucial first step in this process. Waterborne viruses appear to be prime candidates, as they are detectable and quantifiable in both wastewater and human excrement. Non-waterborne viruses have been shown to be detected in human excrement, and some have been reported to be detected in wastewater. Wastewater-based epidemiology therefore has the potential to expand beyond waterborne viruses. Routine monitoring for temporal changes in virus concentration and diversity in community wastewater, in combination with monitoring metabolites and biomarkers for population adjustments, allows early detection of outbreaks (critical moments for the onset of an outbreak). In addition, carefully designed spatial sampling of wastewater will allow detection of locations where an outbreak may begin to develop and spread (critical locations for the onset of an outbreak). Considerations in sampling locations must be taken with regard to the area of investigation, as urban and rural areas may have differences in the respective wastewater systems that can affect viral transport in the water environment. Moreover, to obtain an accurate estimation of disease cases in a population, other factors must be considered such as viral shedding rates, environmental transport and degradation rates, and correlation with reported clinical disease data. Ultimately, there is great opportunity for the use of wastewater-based epidemiology to investigate viral outbreaks within a community. Comprehensive application of the various factors discussed above is crucial for the full potential of this methodology to be realized. Further research could clarify many of these issues and allow for the full development and application of this new epidemiological technique for studying, identifying, and predicting viral outbreaks. His research work involves the investigation and characterization of viral diversity in wastewater and surface waters. His first project utilized next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analyses to compare viral diversity in wastewater effluents between conventional activated sludge and membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment plants. His subsequent project employed these methods in addition to RT-qPCR to investigate viral abundance and diversity in wastewater and its impact on surface water in Uganda. His interest in the field of water resources arises from a lifelong appreciation of wilderness and the outdoors, cultivated while working as a camp counselor in northern Wisconsin.

Her research projects are funded by National Science Foundation, US Environmental Protection Agency, US Geological Survey, US Department of Homeland Security, Water Research Foundation, and Water Environmental Research Foundation. Her latest research project, funded by the National Science Foundation, explores wastewater-based epidemiology methods for early detection and prediction of water-related viral outbreaks. The basic principles of this methodology are described in the article presented in this book. Dr. Xagoraraki is also involved in multiple international projects in Uganda, Mexico, France, and the Republic of Georgia. Dr. Xagoraraki loves to be surrounded by water. She enjoys the beautiful shores of the Great Lakes in Michigan, but to find inspiration and reconnect with her origins, she visits the incredible Aegean Sea in the island of Crete, Greece, where she was born and raised.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}]}
