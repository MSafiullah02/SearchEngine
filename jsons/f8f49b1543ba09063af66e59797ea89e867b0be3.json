However, our lack of understanding of the molecular processes and host cell signaling events underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection hinder therapy development. We employed a SARS-CoV-2 infection system in permissible human cells to 20 study signaling changes by phospho-proteomics. We identified viral protein phosphorylation and defined phosphorylation-driven host cell signaling changes upon infection. Growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling and downstream pathways were activated. Drug-protein network analyses revealed GFR signaling as key pathway targetable by approved drugs. Inhibition of GFR downstream signaling by five 25 compounds prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells, assessed by cytopathic effect, viral dsRNA production, and viral RNA release into the supernatant. This study describes host cell signaling events upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals GFR signaling as central pathway essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication. It provides with novel strategies for COVID-19 treatment. 30",

In people, it causes coronavirus disease 2019 often accompanied by severe respiratory syndrome (Chen et al., 2020) . To conquer the global health crisis triggered by COVID-19, rapidly establishing drugs is 35 required to dampen the disease course and relieve healthcare institutions. Thus, repurposing of already available and (ideally) approved drugs might be essential to rapidly treat COVID-19. Many studies for proposing repurposing of specific drugs have been conducted in the last months, but mostly remain computational without tests in infection models (Smith and Smith, 2020; Wang, 2020) . In addition, they are hindered by the lack of knowledge about the molecular 40 mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the resulting host-cell responses required to allow viral replication. To rationally repurpose drugs, a molecular understanding of the infection and the changes within the host cell pathways is essential. Experimentally identifying viral targets in the cell allows candidate drugs to be selected with high confidence for further testing in the clinics to reduce the risks for patients resulting from tests with drugs lacking in vitro validation. 45",

            "text": "Viral proteins are produced in the host cell and underlie (and often require) post-translational 85 modification (PTM) by host cell enzymes (Wu et al., 2009) . Accordingly, we assessed viral proteins phosphorylated in the host cell. We identified 33 modification sites on 6 different viral proteins ( Figure 1E -J). Possible functions of the observed modifications largely remain unclear due to a lack of understanding of their molecular function and regulation. SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a was phosphorylated on the luminal side of this transmembrane protein ( Figure 1E ) Membrane 90 protein M was phosphorylated at three serines in close proximity, at the C-terminal, cytoplasmic region of the protein ( Figure 1F ), suggesting a high-activity modification surface. SARS-CoV-1 protein 6 was described to accelerates infections in murine systems (Tangudu et al., 2007) . We found a single phosphorylation of the SARS-CoV-2 protein homologue non-structural protein 6 in host cells ( Figure 1G ) Protein 9b was modified at two sites ( Figure 1H ). However, its function in 95 SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Polyprotein 1b is a large 7,096 amino acid protein heavily processed to generate distinct proteins in SARS-CoV-1 (Tangudu et al., 2007) . We found polyprotein 1b to be modified at three residues, two in a region of unknown function and one in the non-structural protein 11 (NSP11) part of the protein ( Figure 1I ). Our data cannot distinguish whether phosphorylation occurred before or after cleavage and whether 100 phosphorylation may affect processing. SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was heavily phosphorylated ( Figure 1J ). Mapping phosphosites to the structure (residues 47 to 173, PDB: 6vyo) revealed a small surface region, suggesting specific regulation and interaction changes ( Figure 1K ). To reveal host kinases potentially phosphorylating viral proteins, we bioinformatically assessed identified phosphorylation motifs using NetPhos 3.1 and GPS5 (Blom et al., 2004; Wang et al., 105 2020) (Table S3 ). Some motifs present in nucleoprotein were predicted to be modified by CMGC kinases. Among several others, casein kinase II (CK2) kinases are part of the CMGC family and have been independently identified as interaction partners of the nucleoprotein, when expressed in cells (Gordon et al., 2020) . Inhibition of CK2 kinases, could be employed to study possible functional interactions between kinase and viral protein. Taken together, we identified extensive changes in phosphorylation of host and viral proteins after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The role of viral protein modifications remain unclear. However, targeting the corresponding host kinases may offer new treatment strategies.",

We filtered the network for drugs and direct targets and found EGFR as one of the central hits, including a number of regulated proteins in the downstream signaling pathway of EGFR ( Figure 3A ). These downstream targets are also regulated by other GFRs and could thus also be explained by their observed activation upon 170 SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 2 ). 28 clinically approved drugs (largely used in cancer therapy) are already available to target EGFR or downstream targets. Indeed, we found a subnetwork of GFR signaling components remodeled ( Figure 3B ). We mapped identified members of GFR signaling and their respective phosphorylation differences upon SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure  3C ) revealing an extensive overall increase in phosphorylation of the whole pathway, including 175 related components for cytoskeleton remodeling and receptor endocytosis. How GFR signaling might regulate SARS-CoV-2 infection is still matter for speculation. However, GFR signaling inhibition might provide a useful approach already implicated in SARS-CoV induced fibrosis therapy and might be a viable strategy to treat COVID-19.",

For 210 SARS-CoV-1, it was shown that modification of viral proteins can lead to regulation of RNA binding of the nucleoprotein (Wu et al., 2009 ) and is needed for viral replication. Although similar effects in SARS-CoV-2 are likely, this remains to be studied in this novel virus.
