ProMED started in 1994 and currently (as of February 2017) reaches over 70,000 subscribers in at least 185 countries. It was one of the earliest electronic surveillance systems using Internet-based data to detect the early signals of SARS at the beginning of the outbreak, before the official report.",

This low cost and high effective surveillance model was later acknowledged by some Chinese public health professionals, and they attempted to apply the model in practice. In the commonly applied early model, surveillance staff manually searched through media reports on mainstream newspapers, radio and TV on a weekly (or monthly) basis, detected possible abnormal signals, and drafted media surveillance reports which were disseminated to public health professionals and agencies. The 2003 SARS epidemic revealed the overall weakness of Chinese public health system. After that event improvement of traditional surveillance systems were well done; however, few efforts were made to explore and develop infectious disease/emergency public health event-based surveillance by leveraging Internet-based information. The early surveillance using Internet-based data model featured manual searches that were not systematic and long cycles, and could not handle the huge amount of Internet-based information and frequent updating, and therefore tended to miss huge quantity of abnormal signals.",

On May 20 and 21, 2008, an Internet user disclosed the problem with Sanlu milk powder he purchased from a superstore in Taishun County, Jiangsu Province in November 2007, with the title: \u201cCan this milk powder be used for emergency relief?!\u201d The milk powder resulted in abnormal urine of his daughter. In June 2008, on an official website of Chinese governmental authority, there were complaints about suspected contamination of milk powder. The above information was present on the Internet, but was beyond the coverage of Chinese traditional notifiable surveillance systems, and was not detected by additional media surveillance carried out by early public health professional agencies.",

In December 2008, the Chinese Ministry of Health (now the National Health and Family Planning Commission) released the Standards for Disease Prevention and Control Performance Evaluation, in which provincial, prefectural and county level CDCs were required to search international and domestic disease information. From then on, public health surveillance using Internet-based information has become an essential task of CDCs at all levels in China.",

Education background, linguistic ability, age and region, and other factors can affect the habit of Internet information distributors in using texts. To avoid major missing of information, while preliminarily incorporating and screening certain type of events, all descriptive words for the type of events should be included whenever possible. Take infectious atypical pneumonia (SARS) as an example: Different people may use different words to describe it with online texts of different types, such as \u201cinfectious atypical pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS\u2026\u201d If not all of these words are searched for, important information on SARS presented on certain web pages may be missed. Nevertheless, if all these words are used, large amount of irrelevant information may be included following preliminary screening, resulting in many white noises and reduction in the efficiency of manual screening. Therefore, the key word database should not only include the complete list of words to be searched for, but also define the corresponding key words for exclusion, in order to minimize white noises. Of course, reduction in white noise relies on in-depth text analytical technique, such as accurately extracting metadata from each piece of information (covering the event type, number of cases and deaths, and the location, etc.), establishing comprehensive scoring system according to metadata, and defining the appropriate thresholds for inclusion and exclusion, thus enabling the ultimate system to automatically report information that comes with practical implications.",

During the human infected swine influenza epidemic in Mexico in 2009 [later evolved into influenza A (H1N1) pandemic], EHEC O104:H4 outbreak in Germany in 2011, Middle East novel coronavirus epidemic in 2012 (later renamed \u201cMERS\u201d), and West Africa Ebola virus disease in 2014, and other infectious diseases that aroused international concerns, surveillance using Internet-based data, compared to other sources of information shared by WHO and other international public health authorities, could more rapidly provide epidemic information. In addition, through initiative retrieval of relevant information from the Internet, more comprehensive information about the situation could be obtained, which were useful for assessing the risk of importation. Two case studies on MERS and Ebola virus disease are described below.(1)\nMERS: On September 24, 2012, through routine surveillance using Internet-based data, China CDC found a piece of information as following: on September 23, 2012 the official website of the WHO reported a case of novel coronavirus (later named \u201cMERS coronavirus\u201d) infected case identified by UK Department of Health; previously, Saudi Arabia also reported a case; the clinical presentations of the two cases primarily included fever, cough, polypnea and dyspnea and other acute serious respiratory tract conditions, both complicated by acute renal failure. The daily information screening and assessment team preliminarily concluded that the disease was a serious emerging infectious disease which might be international spreading, and therefore suggested China CDC to follow up.On the same day, the Deputy Director General of China CDC organized experts to assess the risk, and then proposed the Chinese Ministry of Health to communicate with the WHO through the information exchange mechanism defined in the International Health Regulations (2005), in order to be informed of the latest development; and communicate promptly with other health agencies around the globe to obtain information on virus, epidemic and response; prepare necessary risk communication materials to launch risk communication in a timely manner as needed; the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention of China CDC makes preparations for emergency laboratory testing; China CDC carries out dynamic risk assessment according to further information gained.Subsequently, China CDC continuously tracked the progress of the epidemic according to Internet information. The official websites of the WHO, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, US CDC, ECDC and other health agencies, ProMED, CIDRAP and other third-party professional websites, and news media, etc. have become important sources of information on the disease and related studies for China CDC, and important evidence base to inform the decision of China Ministry of Health to launch joint prevention and control mechanism with the other departments.(2)\nWest Africa Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak: On March 20, 2014, China CDC received an early warning email from GPHIN:According to Reuter news, as indicated by official of Guinea's Health Ministry on March 19, 2014, since February 2014, an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever of unknown cause has killed at least 23 people among 35 cases in Guinea's southeastern forest region. Symptoms appear as diarrhea and vomiting, with a very high fever. Some cases showed relatively heavy bleeding. Most of the victims had been in contact with the deceased or had handled the bodies. Those infected had been isolated and samples had been sent to Senegal and France for further tests. Local staff presumes it was Lassa fever or another form of cholera, and meanwhile is looking for other possible causes, such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever. More than half of the country's 11.4 million people live on less than $1 a day and many lack access to basic medical facilities and qualified medical staff.\nUpon receipt of the information, the daily information screening and assessment team concluded that the mortality of the condition was high, the level of prevalence was beyond expectation, and the cause was unknown and thus it could not be determined whether it was an emerging infectious disease; the event took place in poverty-stricken country with weak healthcare system (and special background), hence higher risks; nevertheless, the information was released from media, with lower reliability, and further follow-up was needed by referring to Internet-based information. On March 24, 2014, the WHO officially released on its website the information on confirmed Ebola virus disease outbreak in Guinea. On March 31, 2014, China CDC learned about the further progress of the epidemic from the Internet, and decided to discuss about the epidemic at the trend evaluation meeting to be held in April 2014 (a regular meeting held on the 4th working day of each month).\n\nSecondly, the gaps in traditional surveillance in China have been bridged: China CDC used to analyze the events concerned in surveillance using Internet-based data in 2013 (Meng et al., 2015), and found that, among the events revealed on the Internet which conformed to the criteria for public health emergency event-based surveillance reporting in China, only 29% were actually reported by the notifiable reporting system; besides, among those events reported by both the Internet and the notifiable reporting system, 20% were first reported on the Internet instead of the regular surveillance system. This means that, for public health surveillance in China, surveillance using Internet-based data can fill in the gaps of the traditional surveillance to some extent, by reporting more events and more rapidly.\nWeaknesses and prospect of surveillance using Internet-based data in China: To develop a more robust Internet-based information automated surveillance system, the first priority is to try to include as many known websites as possible, in order to avoid missing important information. Nowadays, the Internet is developing rapidly, with various types of websites emerging that present huge amount of information. The system development resources of CDCs at China are limited. Therefore, to date the system developed by China CDC covers only a tiny portion of mainstream websites, hence missing substantial information. Text analysis is also limited, and is simply based on screening with simple key words, text comparison and correlation, etc. Therefore, the information automatically presented by the system usually comes with many white noises, resulting in lower efficiency of routine daily manual information screening. To address these two weaknesses, it is advisable to pool the Internet-based information surveillance resources of various departments (e.g., public security, health, food and drug administration) at different administrative levels (national, provincial, city, and county levels) in China, develop an uniform information retrieval platform and text analysis techniques, and then develop subsystems appropriate for the different departments and administrative levels as needed.\n",
