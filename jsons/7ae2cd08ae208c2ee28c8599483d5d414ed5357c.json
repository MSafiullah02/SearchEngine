Important features of mammalian cells include their ability to perform post-translational modifications and to secrete glycoproteins that are correctly folded and contain complex antennary oligosaccharides with terminal sialic acid. These covalent modifications may modulate the clinical efficacy of the protein (e.g., circulatory half-life and biospecificity) or result in properties that are of interest for biochemical characterization-e.g., with respect to structural stabilization, functional groups, and biological role. Mammalian-produced proteins are quality-controlled through a process whereby the progress of incompletely folded, misassembled, and unassembled proteins into the secretory pathway is selectively inhibited (Hurtley and Helenius, 1989) . The correctly processed material progresses and is generally secreted as fully active protein. Another important feature of mammalian cell expression has been the ability to provide proteins bearing sialyl glycoforms closely resembling glycoproteins produced by humans.

The narrowing down of choices is largely due to the need for cell lines that: (1) are capable of continuous growth; (2) can be grown in suspension (in bioreactors); (3) have low risk of adventitious infection by potentially pathogenic viruses; (4) have genetic stability; and (5) can be readily characterized with respect to karyology, morphology, isoenzymes, and gene copy number. The existence of a variety of host-cell systems, the availability of viral or cDNA-based vectors, and the possibility of either stable or transient expression requires that the prospective user define an expression strategy based on ultimate goals. When the researcher's objectives require <1 mg of protein, transient expression in COS-7 cells is the relevant route.

In addition to the need for successful stable integration, a selection method is needed to fish out the stable transformants from the large population of cells that may contain unstable, intracellular heterologous gene copies. This necessitates cotransfection of a gene conferring some unique phenotypic property. Resistance to cytotoxic drugs is the most frequently applied method for selection of stable transformants. Normally, a gene for recessive drug resistance would be cotransfected into a host cell deficient in that particular activity. The most common approach is the use of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which can be used as a selectable marker in DHFR-deficient CHO cells (Kaufman and Sharp, 1982) .

It is likely that integration occurs at random sites. Given that the mammalian-cell genome is large (>10 9 bp), has 20% to 30% of the DNA as single-copy, and has only 0.1% of the genomic DNA containing coding sequences, it is critical to exert selective pressure to screen out the large number of nonproductive clones. Further amplification in the presence of selective pressure is necessary to obtain clones in which multiple copies of the heterologous gene are obtained through coamplification with the dhfr or other selectable marker gene. In this respect it is wise to screen for high producers at moderate levels of methotrexate (<1 \u00b5M) to prevent enrichment of high-copy-number but unstable integrands.

Following selection of these stable-expressing cells by application of selective pressure, less than or equal to approximately 0.1% of the original population will express the foreign protein. It is thus imperative to use selective pressure in the production of the early stable-expressing clones to prevent overgrowth with nonproducing cells. For CHO dhfr \u2212 host-based production, the cells are grown in medium deficient in nucleosides (e.g., \u03b1-MEM medium from Life Technologies), containing serum that has been dialyzed (to remove low-molecular-weight nucleosides such as hypoxanthine), and supplemented with 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5M methotrexate. In deficient medium, the cell's requirement for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides is satisfied by the action of heterologous dihydrofolate reductase, which converts folate from the medium to tetrahydrofolate (FH 4 ). FH 4 and serine are then used by cellular serine hydroxymethyl transferase to provide methylene-FH 4 which can go on to donate C1 units in the reactions required for inosinic acid and thymidine production.

Another significant feature of the ER is that its redox potential is sufficiently high to enable disulfidebond formation (Hwang et al., 1992 circled 2, \u03b1-glucosidase II; circled 3, \u03b1-1,2-mannosidase; circled 4, GlcNAc transferase I; circled 5, \u03b1-mannosidase II; circled 6, GlcNAc transferase II; circled 7, \u03b1-1,6-fucosyl transferase; circled 8, \u03b2-1,4-galactose transferase; and circled 9, \u03b1-2,3-sialyl transferase.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 63, "end": 83, "text": "(Burke et al., 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 276, "end": 304, "text": "(Gething and Sambrook, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 305, "end": 328, "text": "Rothman and Orci, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 329, "end": 352, "text": "Wirth and Hauser, 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 353, "end": 367, "text": "Rothman, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 554, "end": 576, "text": "(Baumann et al., 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 643, "end": 666, "text": "(Lodish and Kong, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 790, "end": 809, "text": "(Hwang et al., 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Production of Recombinant Proteins"}, {"text": "that glutathione is the redox buffer and that the redox potential of the ER is 20 to 100 times more oxidizing than that of the cytosol as indicated by the GSH/GSSG ratios (between 1:1 and 1:3 in the ER as compared to between 30:1 and 100:1 in the cytosol; Hwang et al., 1992) . The ER contains soluble folding enzymes such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and prolyl isomerase, which serve to aid the refolding process. Another group of proteins known as chaperones (Ellis and Hemmingsen, 1989 ) are present in the ER and appear to assist in protein folding and to ensure that incorrectly folded protein is not released from the ER, thus playing a quality-assurance role for newly synthesized protein in the cell. The best-studied chaperone is the glucose response protein BiP (or GRP 78), a member of the hsp70 family of proteins (Munro and Pelham, 1987; Hendershot et al., 1988 ). An ER integral membrane protein called calnexin (Bergeron et al., 1994) also appears to function in quality control of protein folding in the ER and affects the retention of incorrectly folded protein. Calnexin is unrelated to the heat-shock chaperone Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 families. As the protein is folding in the ER, N-linked oligosaccharides are added to the nascent chain via dolichol phosphate. Intramolecular disulfide bonds are formed with the assistance of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and the molecular chaperone BiP/GRP78 associates with the refolding peptide chain. Multiple cycles of BiP binding and release occur in a process that requires ATP. Protein folding occurs with high efficiency and with a half-time on the order of 1 min. Pulse-chase studies of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBVsAg) secretion in mouse fibroblast cells (Huovila et al., 1992) showed that the formation of HBVsAg dimers in the ER occurred rapidly, within 2 min, while formation of higher-order oligomers occurred with a halftime of 2 hr. The study also provided evidence that the rate-limiting step was likely to be passage from the ER into the Golgi, as mature intracellular glycosylated HBV was not detected. The higher-order assembly of subunits or assembly of multimeric proteins begins in the ER and is likely completed in the so-called 15\u00b0c ompartment (named because of accumulation of molecules there at low temperature). This appeared to be the case for HBVsAg (Huovila et al., 1992) . When a monomeric subunit is extensively folded, the BiP dissociates, and for multimeric proteins such as viral membrane proteins, subunit-subunit recognition and assembly occurs prior to transport into the Golgi complex (Doms et al., 1993) . Only correctly folded protein progresses from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Protein may be misfolded as a result of inefficient folding, mutations, heat shock, energy depletion, or addition of exogenous reductants such as dithiothreitol. These misfolded proteins usually form aggregates and typically display permanent and stable association with BiP. Aggregates are eventually degraded unless they are salvaged through a pathway that facilitates refolding from the misfolded protein species under specific conditions-e.g., altered temperature for temperature-sensitive folding mutants or where the ER environment is experimentally altered.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 275, "text": "Hwang et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 470, "end": 497, "text": "(Ellis and Hemmingsen, 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 835, "end": 859, "text": "(Munro and Pelham, 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 860, "end": 883, "text": "Hendershot et al., 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 935, "end": 958, "text": "(Bergeron et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1761, "text": "(Huovila et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2354, "end": 2376, "text": "(Huovila et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2599, "end": 2618, "text": "(Doms et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Production of Recombinant Proteins"}, {"text": "Proteins that have successfully folded in the ER are destined for secretion to the plasma membrane or the intracellular compartments, including the ER itself.

In CHO cells the dominant sialic acid found is N-acetyl neuraminic acid. Transport of the protein through the secretory and endocytic pathways is mediated by small vesicles that bud off from one compartment and fuse to the next compartment (Rothman and Orci, 1992) . The cis Golgi stack (CGN) and trans Golgi stack (TGN) are defined areas of the entire Golgi network. The CGN and TGN constitute the entry and exit faces, respectively, and are involved in sorting and distribution of the protein. The CGN includes the KDEL salvage pathway for ER-based proteins. The TGN is where proteins with differing final destinations-e.g., lysosomes, secretory vesicles, and plasma membrane-diverge. The Golgi consists of stacks of cisternae where carbohydrate-chain trimming and elongation as well as other covalent modifications occur. The mechanism of flow through the Golgi cisternae appears to involve assembly of coated vesicles, which then transfer to the next compartment with concomitant loss of the coat. The loss of coat is linked to GTP-dependent hydrolysis, while subsequent fusion at the destination cisternae is ATP-dependent and also involves an N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive enzyme, Sec18p. The specificity of vesicle targeting involves a docking mechanism based on binding of soluble NEM-sensitive attachment protein (SNAP) to a receptor designated as SNARE.

Nutrients must satisfy the requirements for growth, maintenance of the cell, and expression of products. Additional specific growth factors such as insulin or insulin-like growth factor (IGF) are usually required. Minimal nutritional requirements were first defined in the 1950s (Eagle, 1955) . These early studies showed that thirteen amino acids (Arg, Cys, Gln, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, Tyr, and Val), eight vitamins (biotin, folic acid, niacinamide, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, and thiamine), and various salts and minerals (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, PO 4 , Fe, Zn, Se, and possibly Cu, Mn, Mo, and V, which are usually present as trace contaminants) are required. The commonly used CHO derivatives DXB11 and DG44 have an absolute requirement for proline that results from a genetic deficiency in the conversion of glutamic acid to glutamic \u03b3-semialdehyde. Inorganic ions may function as catalysts or exert physiological effects. Glucose (5 to 20 mM) and glutamine (0.5 to 5 mM) are commonly used to provide the energy source for the cells. These are consumed at a rate proportional to the viable-cell concentration. Cultured mammalian cells do not use the complete tricarboxcylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the glucose-consumption rate is lower than the glutamine consumption rate. Consumption of glucose yields lactate and consumption of glutamine yields ammonia as the metabolic byproduct. Other nutrients are consumed at a rate proportional to the rate of increase in cell density. Yield-based uptake rates for amino acids by CHO DG 44 cells range from 0.1 mM tryptophan/10 9 cells to 0.8 mM arginine/10 9 cells at a specific growth rate (the rate of growth divided by the cell density) of 0.25 to 0.30 days \u22121 (D.

Increases in ammonium ion concentration to 10 mM in the culture medium resulted in substantial growth inhibition in hybridoma cells (McQueen and Bailey, 1990 ) and appeared to inhibit growth in most cell lines. The likely cause of this is the transport of ammonium ion by membrane-bound ion pumps and ultimate acidification of the cytoplasm (Martinelle et al., 1996) . Lower levels of ammonia (\u223c2 mM) may exert influences on glycosylation (Andersen et al., 1994) . One approach to eliminating this potential inhibition of cell growth is through adaptation to a nonammoniagenic medium. This medium would contain glutamate or 2-oxoglutarate in place of glutamine (Hassel and Butler, 1990) . Lactate generated from glucose can also reach growth inhibitory levels at >15 mM. Optimization of medium and perfusion rate may enable reduction in the levels of lactate and ammonia, allowing higher cell density. Lowering the glucose level may reduce the yield of lactate, but concomitant limitation of glycosylation may occur. CO 2 may accumulate in high-density cultures, thereby exerting an inhibitory effect on the culture . Limitations that are due to CO 2 accumulation may be overcome by choosing an optimal sparging strategy. Finally mammalian cells are weaker and larger than bacterial cells and limits to the degree of agitation are important to prevent cell damage and death. Where agitation is used in reactors or in sample handling, cell damage at the gas-liquid interface as well as bubble damage can be reduced by adding low levels-<0.1% (w/v)-of the surfactant pluronic polyol (Murhammer and Goochee, 1990 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 206, "text": "(McQueen and Bailey, 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 390, "end": 415, "text": "(Martinelle et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 488, "end": 511, "text": "(Andersen et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 710, "end": 735, "text": "(Hassel and Butler, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1658, "text": "(Murhammer and Goochee, 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "5.9.13"}, {"text": "Both yeast and E. coli heterologous protein expression are very well defined.

At the present time the mammalian expression systems are not available as turnkey, catalog-based systems. The user must define the components for a particular application.

The ability to transfer foreign DNA into these cells enables a greater understanding of the mammalian cell transcriptional, translational, and post-translational machinery.
