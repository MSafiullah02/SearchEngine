According to the WHO 2 , dengue virus has been transmitted by female mosquitoes-mainly of the species Aedes aegypti (aka yellow fever mosquito) and Aedes albopictus (aka Stegomyia albopicta, Asian tiger mosquito, or forest mosquito)-in recent years. Their incubation period ranges from 4 to 10 days. These mosquitoes are also vectors of other viruses such as chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika. Dengue is widespread throughout the tropics, with local variations in risk influenced by rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and unplanned rapid urbanization. It has outbreaks in more than 100 countries worldwide, and is estimated to infect 50-100 million people yearly. As infected humans are source of contamination for non-infected mosquitoes, the spread of the disease can be very fast. The first symptoms appear 2-7 days after the mosquito bite. There are four dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) with different severities in which symptoms range from severe headaches, fever, muscle and joint pains until plasma leaking, severe bleeding or organ damaged that can lead to death. A person that was infected by one of the virus gets immunized only for the specific one. There are no vaccinations available for dengue. The only way to stop the spread of the disease is preventing the procreation of the mosquito. Among the methods for prevention are the proper covering of water containers or any other material that accumulates water as the female mosquito needs water in order to lay its eggs. Also, during outbreaks the population can wear repellents, clothing that covers skin and install screens at windows and doors. The procreation occurs under some weather conditions (e.g., rainfall, temperature, relative humidity) and the population density.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Due to the relation between weather conditions and the proliferation of the dengue vector mosquito, statistical and machine-learning models can be used for forecasting the number of dengue cases based on weather conditions [11, 12, 21] .

Hence, high frequency of a term (e.g., \"dengue\") could be an indication of an epidemic. Back in 2005 and 2006, there were a high frequency of the search term \"bird flu\" due to the global spread of bird flu, especially in China and Turkey. Models for predicting influenza and dengue were created based on the frequency of terms. Such an idea has been incorporated into platforms such as (i) Google Flu Trends and (ii) Google Dengue Trends 4 , which are no longer publishing current estimates of flu or dengue fever based on search patterns. Despite the positive impacts of their approach, they also observed that external factors (e.g., media influence, language barriers, false positives) may affect the number of searches not correlating with actual cases of diseases. For example, media can drive such scenarios depending on what they publish.
