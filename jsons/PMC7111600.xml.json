To date, we have noticed quite a wide clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and pulmonary infiltrations. A large proportion of reported symptomatic cases, including our patients and many others, followed a similar track of progression. The infection often started with mild or moderate unspecific symptoms, including but not limited to low-grade fever, sore throat, coughing, fatigue, and malaise, similar to the symptoms of a common cold. The initial symptoms would abate or persist for around 3\u20137 days, when high-grade fever developed and respiratory distress became quite prominent. Some of these patients would also have gastrointestinal symptoms during this period. However, if we look at the CT series shown here, which were quite typical of most COVID-19 patients, we would have a very strong impression that most of the lesions started from the periphery, especially the subpleural region when acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed [5].

The third phase is the final recovery phase. This was demonstrated by not only the clinical features but also the laboratory dynamics, including progressive lymphocytopenia and elevated inflammation markers at the time of acceleration. Therefore, strategies against COVID-19 should also be specified according to the course of infection. The best timing of antivirals, if any are used, may lie in the phase before acceleration. When clinical deterioration begins, the first few days of deterioration may present a critical point when potent suppression of the inflammatory cascade could save the patients from fatal immune-mediated injuries, as shown here. Moreover, from the experiences of our patients, if the acceleration of the disease could be stopped, it seemed to work well even if no effective antiviral drugs were given.",

The dose of IVIg was determined based on well-established practice in immune modulation therapy for other diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, etc. [6, 7], with a consideration of potential cardiac or renal impairment in severe COVID-19 patients. None of the 3 patients reported any adverse events. All patients were clinically improved shortly after the administration, with their temperature back to normal in 1\u20132 days and breathing difficulties alleviating in 3\u20135 days. Confounding factors did exist, including the use of different antivirals in 2 of the 3 patients at various time points and a short course of steroids in patient 3. Moreover, in patient 2, valsartan, an angiotensin receptor 1 blocker (AT1R), had been used for treating hypertension. As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the major receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9], there has been a hypothesis that higher expression of ACE2 after being chronically medicated with AT1R may protect SARS-CoV-2-infected patients against acute lung injury rather than putting them at higher risk, though this currently remains unproven [10]. Nevertheless, from the timeline and patterns of disease course in these 3 patients, it is most probable that high-dose IVIg played the leading role in their recovery.",

As a complex preparation, it contains a large number of bioactive moieties, and the entirety of its effects is not yet fully understood. IVIg of higher dose has been a choice of immunomodulatory therapy for autoimmune or inflammatory disease and for prophylaxis and treatment of severe infections, especially in immunocompromised patients [11, 12]. Several theories have been proposed to explain its potential immunomodulatory mechanisms, including Fc-mediated and Fab-mediated approaches [13, 14]. In previous studies of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), IVIg therapy has exhibited various clinical benefits with good tolerance [15\u201317]. Considering its efficacy in improving passive immunity and modulating immune inflammation and the overall safety profile, high-dose IVIg could be considered a promising option at the early stage of clinical deterioration of patents with COVID-19.",

However, this report provides an important therapeutic clue to the current situation of rapid disease spreading. The timing of IVIg administration is critical in practice. Patients might not receive much benefit when systemic damage has already taken place. Currently, a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficiency of high-dose IVIg therapy in severe COVID-19 has been initiated (NCT 04261426), which will provide more evidence for IVIg use in treating such patients.",
