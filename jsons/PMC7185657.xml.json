Exposure to bioaerosols can lead to many respiratory and other adverse health effects, such as infections, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and toxic reactions (Douwes, Thorne, Pearce, & Heederik, 2003). The generation and transmission of some pathogenic microbial species can even cause severe casualties, such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Ksiazek et al., 2003), the H1N1 flu in 2009 (Bautista et al., 2010), H7N9 avian influenza in 2013 (Li et al., 2014), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015 (Zumla, Hui, & Perlman, 2015). For certain highly infectious agents, even very low dose inhalation exposure could constitute a serious threat, such as influenza A virus (Blachere et al., 2009), Francisella tularensis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Cole & Cook, 1998). In addition, the potential bioterrorism attack using highly infectious microbial agents is posing an increasing threat to the public (Jernigan et al., 2002). For detecting these agents, we need to collect as much as possible amount of air. On the other hand, for \"detect-to-warn\" objective, the ideal time was described to be 1 min by National Research Council of the United States of America (National Research Council, 2005), thus the time for air sampling is very limited for certain urgent circumstances. Accordingly, it is of critical importance to develop a detection protocol that is capable of capturing low counts within a very short time period to allow a proper counter-measure to be mounted.",

            "text": "Use of microbial aerosol samplers is usually the first step to assess the presence of bioaerosols and their exposure risks (Yao and Mainelis, 2006aa, Yao and Mainelis, 2006bb). The currently available microbial aerosol samplers can be generally classified into four major types: impaction, impingement, filtration, and electrostatic precipitation (Willeke et al., 1998, Yao and Mainelis, 2006c, Yao and Mainelis, 2007). The impaction-based samplers are widely used in bioaerosol investigations (Xu & Yao, 2011). Previously, Yao and Mainelis (2007) investigated the performances of several commonly used microbial aerosol samplers in both laboratory settings and field tests. One of the important parameter describing the performance of the sampler is the cut-off size, at which the sampler has a collection efficiency of at least 50%. This parameter can be derived experimentally from the sampler's physical collection efficiency curve. For the bioaerosol detection, the cut-off size should be generally below the particle size range of interest (in single particle form) to ensure ideal collection efficiency. Such a particle size is currently assumed to be either 2.5\u201310 \u00b5m aerodynamic diameter (AD), as used in the U.S. Government Biological Integrated Detection System, or 1\u201310 \u00b5m AD, as used in the U.S. Government Joint Biological Point Detection System (Haglund & Mcfarland, 2004). For a typical impactor design, a number of important parameters such as Reynolds number (Re), impactor jet diameter (W), jet-to-late distance (S), jet throat length (T), sampling flow rate (Q) and the number of impactor jets should be considered (Marple & Willeke, 1976).",

            "text": "The widely used bioaerosol collection device BioStage (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA) is a standard impactor with a cut-off size of 0.65 \u00b5m, 400 impactor jets (W = 0.25 mm), an impaction velocity of 24 m/s, and a Reynolds number of about 400, which provides high collection efficiency of most microbial particles present in the air. Therefore, it is recognized as the gold standard bioaerosol sampler (Brachman et al., 1964) and used as the reference sampler in many studies evaluating microbial samplers (Yao & Mainelis, 2006a). However, the flowrate of the BioStage sampler is only 28.3 L/min and it takes at least half an hour to obtain 1 m3 air in addition to requiring an external power source. Previous studies have shown that longer sampling time would introduce more desiccation and particle bounce effects (He and Yao, 2011, Xu and Yao, 2011, Zhen et al., 2009). Also the performance of samplers with low flowrate is easily affected by wind velocity and atmospheric movement in outdoor environments (Xu & Yao, 2013). Although the BioStage impactor has higher physical collection efficiency, it causes damages to the cells being collected due to its high impaction velocity (24 m/s). In certain scenarios, the target microorganisms appear to be in low counts, thus much larger sampling flowrates are required to concentrate several orders of magnitude within the response time (Haglund & Mcfarland, 2004), especially in an emergency situation. Flowrates of 100\u20131000 L/min are generally thought to be practical for the reliable detection of low-concentration biological agents that could be expected from an accidental or intentional release (Haglund & Mcfarland, 2004). For example, a cyclone type sampler with flowrate of 1000 L/min was chosen to detect Legionella in the air during the Legionnaires disease outbreak (Mathieu et al., 2006). In addition, another added feature for a microbial aerosol sampler is to be more portable (An, Mainelis, & Yao, 2004). Compared to the conventional samplers which require vacuum pumps and external power supply, portable samplers, such as the Reuters Centrifugal Sampler (RCS) (Biotest Diagnostics Corp., Denvile, NJ, USA), has the capability to be used in various conditions, for example, in remote areas where the electricity is not available or restricted. Nonetheless, most of these existing battery-powered samplers have sampling flow rates of less than 300 L/min.",

The HighBioTrap also has a very high Reynolds number. If the Eq.

Using the Eq. (2), the Reynolds number of our sampler with a round nozzle of 50 mm width is about 33953. This high Reynolds number indicates that the air flow is in turbulent status. Therefore, the jet-to-plate distance was designed to be 75 mm to minimize the effect of the whirlpool, which correspondingly results in a S/W ratio of 1.5 for the HighBioTrap. Nonetheless, the high flow rate and reasonable impaction velocity is our top priority consideration for the design of the HighBioTrap sampler. Here, we wanted to design a high volume and portable sampler, which requires low pressure drop. Accordingly, the jet nozzle cannot be small otherwise it is rather difficult to make it portable because of the power needed. In general, for Reynolds number between 500 and 3000, the collection efficiency curve is very sharp, like typical \u201cS\u201d. Here, the Reynolds number for our sampler is very large, i.e., 33953, and according to reference (Marple & Willeke, 1976) for large Reynolds number the collection curve tends to be more flat.",

Bacterial suspensions were prepared following the procedure described in a previous study (Yao & Mainelis, 2006a). Before preparing their suspensions, these two bacterial strains were cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates. After the cultivation, bacterial colonies were washed off and harvested with 20 mL sterile DI-water. Stock bacterial suspensions were washed 3 times using a centrifuge (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5804 R, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 7000 rpm for 7 min and a vortex to re-suspended (Vortex Genie 2, Scientific Industries Co., Ltd.). Prior to the aerosolization, the freshly prepared bacterial suspension was diluted using DI water to achieve desired airborne bioaerosol concentration. Here, we measured the aerosolized bacterial aerosol concentration size distributions as shown in Fig S1 (Supporting information). In our work, we used vegetative cells of B. subtilis, however it is possible that some of them could form spores (they should be a small fraction, but we did not measure it). The reported aerodynamic diameter should largely represent those of vegetative cells. In addition to three aerosolized particles, the physical collection efficiency was also determined by indoor air particles.

The aerosol was being generated by flowing N2 into the particle suspension. The test particles were then carried by nitrogen into the test chamber and diluted with the clean air before passing the HighBioTrap sampler. Because the HighBioTrap has a very high sampling flow rate, the aerosol generating N2 flow (2.5 L/min) was not enough to supply the demand. Accordingly, the clean air inside the BioSafety hood was used to compensate. The speed controller was used to adjust the fan speed to keep the working flow rate of the HighBioTrap sampler remaining constantly at 1200 L/min no matter whether there is an agar plate in place or not. In our experimental setup, the fan not only served as a motor to move the air particles to impact onto the plate, but also a mixer to dilute the aerosol with the clean air. Before every sampling process, the sampler is wiped using 75% ethanol and then put the sampler under the ultraviolet radiation for half an hour.",

For the measurement by sampling the same volume of air, the BioStage sampler sampling time was set to be tBioStage = 17.7 min (500 L of air at QBioStage = 28.3 L/min). During the sampling process of BioStage, the HighBioTrap was operated for tHighBioTrap = 25 s (500 L of air at QHighBioTrap = 1200 L/min), and repeat the sampling process 8 times to collect 8 agar plate samples. For sampling the same amount of air, we were testing the performance of each sampler for sampling the same amount of airborne particles in the same environment. This is based on the assumption that given a very short time period the particle concentration won\u2019t change greatly. For each sampling location, the sampling experiments for both samplers were repeated three times within 1 h. For the HighBioTrap sampler, it takes about 3 s to achieve the final flow rate (1200 L/min) and also 3 s to stop the fan when the sampler is turned off. The sampling time of the HighBioTrap is controlled by an integrated electric control unit and the sampling time was counted from the start of the sampler to the time at which the power is being turned. During the first 3 s, the sampler samples at a gradually increasing flow rate, but counted as 1200 L/min, and after turning off the power the fan continues working for another 3 s but with a gradually reducing flow rate. Therefore, the first and last three seconds' sampling compensate each other for the total sampling air volume for the given sampling time The bioaerosol concentration levels were not obtained for the environment during the sampling. There could be some concentration variations during the sampling, however they have occurred to both samplers and could be also averaged out among the three repeats. Here, the conditions of temperature and relative humidity (RH) were not measured at the time of experiments. However, if the conditions have impacts, they will occur to both samplers since the samplers were operated simultaneously. Nonetheless, both of these two environments are indoor environments in the campus building which typically remain at a room temperature of about 25 \u00b0C and a RH value of about 40%.",

In addition, the bacterial community diversities were investigated by using high throughout sequencing to identify the impaction stress of two samplers and their ability of preserving the microbial aerosol culturability.",

            "text": "\nFig. 3 showed physical collection efficiency determined by laboratory tests when sampling aerosolized PS particles, bacterial aerosols (B. subtilis var. niger and P. fluorescens) as well as indoor air particles. As observed in Fig. 3, the cut-off size when sampling aerosolized PS particles is about 2 \u00b5m, which is slightly bigger than the SAS super 180, MAS-100, RCS High Flow, Millipore Air Tester while much smaller than SMA MicroPortable, BioCulture, and Microflow as shown in the Table 1. The HighBioTrap was proposed to collect the most of airborne biological particles, which covers a larger size range from 0.3 \u00b5m to several tens of micrometers. Also, the HighBioTrap sampler was designed to have a high flow rate (> 1000 L/min) to substantially reduce the sampling time. The wider nozzle diameter and longer impaction distance (as shown in Table 1) were adopted in the sampler design in achieving portable and high flow rate sampling strategy. This, however, resulted in a relatively large cutoff size of about 2 \u00b5m compared to 0.65 \u00b5m for the BioStage impactor. But for most of natural bacteria, the aerodynamic size was larger than 3 \u00b5m (Shaffer & Lighthart, 1997) due to aggregation or adhesion to large non-biological particles, which implies acceptable collection efficiency of the HighBioTrap for environmental sampling. As the particle size increased, the collection efficiency increased up to 70% at about 3 \u00b5m but remained the same at 5 \u00b5m. The variances of collection efficiencies were getting larger as the particle size getting lager. When preparing PS suspension used for aerosolization, the particle suspension of each size is diluted to the same concentration of about 108 particles/mL and mixed well, while the lager particles are harder to be aerosolized by the nebulizer. Therefore, the concentration of large particles was lower than the smaller particles as identified by the OPC (not listed here), which resulted in the different variances of collection efficiencies of different particle sizes. The curve seems not to be very sharp as that of the Andersen type impactors discussed by Ranz and Wong (1952), and this also implies poorer cut-off characteristics. The relative flat physical collection efficiency curve was mainly caused by the higher Reynolds number of the air flow in the jet. Previously, the impactors are designed to have a low volume of about several tens of liters per minute and maintain laminar motion as the Reynolds numbers were recommended to be kept from 500 to 3000 (Marple & Willeke, 1976). While the HighBioTrap is designed to have an extreme high flow rate and the air flow is at fierce turbulence with a Reynolds number of 33,953, which would lead to some loss of bigger particles. The Reynolds number effect was previously studied on the basis of potential flow theory (Davies & Aylward, 1951). However, when sampling indoor aerosol particles, the collection efficiencies were observed to be slightly lower as shown in Fig. 3 compared to outdoor air sampling.",

For the outdoor sampling site, the mean count of airborne culturable bacteria as determined by the HighBioTrap was 77 CFU (77 CFU per minute) by sampling 1 min to 153 CFU (31 CFU per minute) by sampling 5 min, which is significantly higher than that determined by the reference sampler, 17\u201337 CFU (17 to 8 CFU per minute) from sampling 1\u20135 min (p < 0.001). Although the cut-off size of the HighBioTrap is larger than that of BioStage as described above, the 42 times higher flow rate of the HighBioTrap, compared to the BioStage, ensures more bacteria collected by the same sampling time and the CFU count ratio is about 300\u2013450%. However, the biological efficiency of the HighBioTrap identified by sampling the same volume air is lower than that of the reference sampler. As shown in Fig. 4, when sampling 500 L air in outdoor sampling site (the 4th floor lab room window site), the HighBioTrap sampler presented about 14 CFU on average, which is significantly lower than 41 CFU identified by the BioStage (p < 0.001). This result also can be obtained from the sampling tests of the same time by converting the CFU count to the bacteria concentration using the Eq. (4) described in \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section (for the BioStage, the concentration result is factor-corrected, while not for the HighBioTrap). The BioStage impactor consistently reported higher concentrations than the HighBioTrap when sampling airborne bacteria. The differences between the bacterial concentrations measured by the samplers were also analyzed by the paired t-tests. All of their p-values were below 0.001, indicating that there was a statistically significant difference between the concentrations measured by the BioStage and the HighBioTrap under all sampling time settings.

The impaction velocity of the BioStage is higher than that of the HighBioTrap, which caused microbial aerosol embedding. In addition, the relative collection efficiency determined by 500 L air sampling test was about 35.0%, significantly improved compared to that obtained using the same time sampling test (ANOVA test, p = 0.036). This is due to the fact that when sampling 500 L, the BioStage took 17.6 min which posed sustained desiccation stress on the agar plate, while the HighBioTrap sampler used only 25 s which thus caused quick desiccation (because of shorter time) and less particle bounce.

This result indicated that the HighBioTrap had relative higher efficiency when sampling particles in outdoor environments. On one hand, the microorganisms in outdoor environment appear in aggregation or adhere to large non-biological particles as discussed above, which improved the actual collection efficiencies. On the other hand, the HighBioTrap sampler is designed to have a flow rate of 1200 l per minute, corresponding to impaction velocity of \u223c10.2 m/s, which makes it more tolerant to the outdoor air conditions, e.g., wind speed and atmospheric movement speed in vertical direction.

Shannon index was widely used for estimating biological species diversity, and higher Shannon index presents higher species diversity. The calculation of the Shannon index can be accessed through the online database (http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Shannon). The Shannon index of the sample collected by the HighBioTrap sampler (5 min for 6 m3 air, and 10 min for 12 m3 air) and the BioStage (5 min for 141.5 L air and 10 min for 283 L air) are 3.35, 3.04, 1.60, and 1.52, respectively. For the HighBioTrap sampler, the culturable bacterial aerosol diversity obtained was higher than those obtained by the BioStage. Although, the higher desiccation effect limited the collection efficiency of the HighBioTrap for an extended sampling, high flow rate would lead to the collection of more microorganisms at the same time, which correspondingly increased the probability of the collection of less frequently occurring species. While for the BioStage, due to its higher sampling stress, e.g., higher impaction velocity (24 m/s) and higher embedding, the culturable bacterial diversity is relative lower, and some species lost the culturability or viability after the sampling process. As shown in the Fig. 6, the predominant species of the sample collected by the HighBioTrap for 5 min are Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, while for the BioStage, the predominant species was only Bacillus (the top 15 species in genus level were listed in Table S1), the species which is more resistant to the environmental stress or impaction stress. Similar to the results obtained by the culture method, the sampling time is an important factor influencing the collection of bacterial aerosols for both methods. Despite that increasing collection time would result in more microorganisms collected by the samplers, an increase in sampling time would introduce a stronger desiccation and particle bounce effect on the microorganisms, which unfortunately reduced the diversity of the sample due to damages to those sensitive species.",

            "text": "When sampling at the indoor site, the bacterial species obtained are different by two samplers. The Shannon index of the sample collected by the HighBioTrap (5 min for 6 m3 air, and 10 for 12 m3 air) and the BioStage (5 min for 141.5 L air and 10 min for 283 L air) are 2.24, 1.24, 2.59, and 2.68, respectively. This indicates when sampling indoor bacterial aerosols, the BioStage can collect more microorganisms and obtain higher bacterial diversity, which might be due to the increasing collection efficiency of the BioStage in the indoor environments as discussed above. This is also due to the dominance of smaller bacteria in indoor environments (Reponen, Willeke, Grinshpun, & Nevalainen, 2011). As seen from Fig. 6(b), when increasing the sampling time, Pseudomonas was shown to be collected more, which indicates the Pseudomonas species was dominant in the environment (the top 15 species in genus level were listed in Table S2). While for the BioStage, increasing sampling time caused the loss of Pseudomonas, which indicated the high sampling stress resulting from the long time sampling, e.g., the impaction injuries, of the BioStage. Although the BioStage impactor has higher physical collection efficiency, it causes damages to the cells being collected due to its high impaction velocity (24 m/s). The biological collection efficiency is a function of the samplers' physical collection efficiency, sampling stress, collection medium surface characteristics and also the target species. The sampler's physical collection efficiency is largely determined by the cutoff size, while the sampling stress includes impaction and desiccation. The collection medium surface determines the particle bounce and the microbial particle embedding, e.g., the agar plate. The target species is also an important factor to consider when selecting a sampler as sensitive microbes are more vulnerable to the sampling stress as discussed. The developed HighBioTrap has a very high sampling flow rate (1200 L/min) compared to the BioStage impactor (28.3 L/min), thus given the same amount of time the HighBioTrap can recover more less-frequently microbial species from the air than the BioStage impactor, thus resulting in higher microbial aerosol diversity. On the other hand, the HighBioTrap also has lower impaction velocity (10.2 m/s) compared to that of the BioStage impactor (it is 24 m/s). Overall, the impaction stress difference between the two samplers might play a lesser role in the culturable diversity difference recovered by two different samplers given the same sampling time compared to the difference in their air volumes collected. Nonetheless, increased sampling time led to more desiccation effects for the HighBioTrap than the BioStage impactor. The HighBioTrap sampler was designed to be mostly used for field sampling in natural environments where microbial aerosol particles often appear to be agglomerates or attach to large non-biological particles. These possibilities certainly allow the HighBioTrap to collect those small biological aerosol particles in nature. In terms of species detection for qualitative analysis, the HighBioTrap has obvious advantages compared to the BioStage impactor.",

            "text": "As part of our continued effort to developing efficient bioaerosol sampling protocols, this study is focused on the development of high flow rate portable sampler. The experimental tests showed that the HighBioTrap has a cutoff size of 2 \u00b5m, and had reasonable biological and physical collection efficiencies compared to the reference sampler, the BioStage impactor. Similar to other studies, the results from this study indicated that sampling time, sampling environment, desiccation and impaction stress are important factors influencing the overall performance of a microbial aerosol sampler. The HighBioTrap developed in this work was shown to report the higher outdoor bacterial aerosol diversity compared to the reference sampler given the same sampling time, which is largely resulting from higher flow rate. High flow rate resulted in collecting less frequently occurring species in short sampling time, and low impaction velocity (~10.2 m/s) preserves more on microbial culturability. In addition to developing the high volume sampler, our data also showed that strong desiccation effects might occur between 3 and 5 min after the sampling. Based on our data and existing literature, we believe that an impaction velocity of around 10 m/s might be a close-to-optimal collection velocity for collecting most environmental bacterial aerosols while maximally preserving their culturability. The developed HighBioTrap sampler could be extremely useful when low level of pathogens is present and also detection response is of great concern. The sampler could be also very useful when analyzing microbial aerosol diversity for a particular environment. In couple with a biosensor, the HighBioTrap is capable of providing rapid detection of target microbial agents in the environment.",
