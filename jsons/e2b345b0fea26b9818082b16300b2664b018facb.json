Their analogs 7a-f,h bearing the pyrrole ring instead of the amino group exhibited moderate activity. The most potent compounds 7a and 7e altered cleavage of the sea urchin eggs at concentration of 50 nmol L -1 . Compound 7e caused the sea urchin embryo spinning suggesting the antitubulin mechanism of action, namely, the ability to destabilize microtubules. Apparently, compound 7a ex hibited similar mechanism of action. Although, compound 7a failed to affect the sea urchin embryo swimming, the arrested eggs acquired tuberculate shape typical of micro tubule destabilizers. 18 The pyrrole ring was shown to be essential for antiproliferative effect, since the related struc tures 6 containing the amino group instead of the pyrrole ring were inactive. It is worth noting that the increase in the number of methoxy groups in the benzene ring (com pounds 7a-d) resulted in reduction of the antimitotic properties. In this respect, triazolylfurazans 7 is distin guished from the known analogs of plant antimitotics com bretastatin and podophyllotoxin interacting with the col chicine site of tubulin. Specifically, trimethoxybenzene According to the data of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of USA, compounds 7a and 7e inhibited cancer cell growth at relatively low concentrations (GI 50 = 389 and 295 nmol L -1 , respectively). These compounds were referred to the biological expert committee of NCI as promising for further studies. Leukemia SR cells (7a), melanoma MDA MB 435 cells (7a and 7e) , and the co lon cancer cells (7e) were the most sensitive to triazolyl furazans 7a and 7e. The \"doze-effect\" curves for seven colon cancer cell lines exposed to compound 7e are given in Fig. 2 .",
