A different species, HRV-C, that shares 53 - 57% homology at the amino acid level with HRV-A and HRV-B, was identified in 2006 in patients with acute LRTIs in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America [13-16]. Since its detection, HRV-C has been reported to be a prominent respiratory pathogen in children, causing up to 5% of LRTIs [17] and found in 42% of children with influenza-like infection (ILI) without identification of another pathogen by conventional means [18]. HRV-C has also been implicated as a frequent cause of asthma exacerbation in children [15]. Recent studies indicate that HRVs, as well as HEVs, show great genetic diversity by recombination [17,19], as has been increasingly reported for the HRV-A/HRV-C recombinants [20].",

HRV-A and HRV-C species accounted for the majority of the HRV viruses (58% and 38%, respectively), and showed, in both cases, a great variety of serotypes, including more than 60 for HRV-A. The relative low percentage of HRV-B detected (4% of total HRVs) could relate to the fact that this virus has been shown to present with no fever [7] and our inclusion criteria required a fever \u226538\u00b0C, and thus, we could have underestimated the presence of this virus in the population. However, others have noted similar compositions of the three HRV species, with HRV-B accounting for only 4-11% of all HRVs recovered from subjects with respiratory complaints [7,17,22,35]. Among HEVs, coxsackieviruses, both A and B, were the most predominant. We also identified low numbers of EV-D68, which has been associated with respiratory disease by others [10], although never in the countries of our study. In addition, we identified two cases of EV-A71, an agent traditionally associated with hand-foot-and-mouth disease, as well as severe neurological and cardiac complications [36,37]. EV-A71 has also been infrequently linked with respiratory disease in Canada [38], Taiwan [39], and Australia [40], although never in Latin America. While the prior reports were associated with focal EV-A71 outbreaks, no outbreak in Peru was reported during our study period. Nevertheless, the fact our surveillance spanned multiple Latin American countries over a one-year period and the only two EV-A71 cases occurred within two weeks of each other in towns separated by a mere 25 kilometers suggests a possible unidentified localized outbreak. Other similarities between our EV-A71 respiratory cases and those of prior reports include age < 5 years and mild symptoms.",

Although an analysis spanning three to five years would have been ideal, we analyzed the temporal distribution of the three HRV species and HEVs by aggregating collection sites by their climatic and geographic similarities. As has been previously described in other continents [13,43], HRVs and HEVs showed a similar \u201cyear-long\u201d temporal distribution throughout Central and South America during the one-year period of collection. We did not detect any seasonality for specific HRV-A or HRV-B species, although HRV-C species seemed to possess opposite seasonal trends on either side of the equator. Others have noted seasonal differences among the individual HRV species, including high rates of HRV-A in April in the U.S. [35] and low rates in summer in China [41], high rates of HRV-B during winter in Australia [40] and China [41], and high rates of HRV-C in October in the U.S. [35] and winter in China [17]; like ours, these studies collected samples for only a one or two-year time span.

Our high prevalence of HRV and HEV identification in young Latin Americans indicates that pharmacotherapy against influenza virus or the common bacterial etiologies of respiratory disease should not be presumptive, but guided by diagnostic confirmation when available in this population. Despite the current limitations of rapid diagnosis and clinical management of HRV or HEV respiratory disease, we hope that surveillance such as ours will provide further impetus for the development of rapid diagnostic methods, vaccines, and antivirals, as well as further elucidation of what populations are most at risk and what types of HRV and HEV species are most worth targeting.",

All participants were 25 years old or younger, had a fever (\u226538\u00b0C), and either a cough or sore throat [50]. Once collected, swabs were placed in viral transport media and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until they were transported on dry ice to the Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6 (NAMRU-6) facilities in Lima, Peru. Every site used an identical case report form. This form collected basic epidemiologic information and symptoms prior to presentation.",
