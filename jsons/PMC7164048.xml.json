Many of these studies have focused on the interactions among adult members of the community, but the study of species associations among earlier life stages, such as larvae and juveniles, may also be important harbingers of phase shifts in ecosystem dynamics. In particular, ichthyoplankton are greatly influenced by dynamic physical processes, including oceanographic features such as bathymetry (Doyle et al., 2002), eddies (Atwood et al., 2010), currents and fronts (Norcross et al., 2010; Siddon et al., 2011), as well as meteorological features such as precipitation and freshwater discharge (Boeing and Duffy\u2010Anderson, 2008), wind variation (Rodriguez et al., 2011), and temperature (Genner et al., 2010), which can lead to shifts in community structure, changes in biotic control, and variable species interactions. The sensitivity of early life stages to these and other forcing phenomena potentially make marine fish larvae important sentinels of regional climate variation and ecosystem change.",

The eastern Bering Sea (EBS) has been shown to respond rapidly to climate (Napp and Hunt, 2001). Increasingly, and in light of recent climate variability, there is concern over the present status of the Bering Sea and the future of its ecosystem health (Grebmeier et al., 2006). Studies that examine processes that might be driving ecosystem regime shifts (Niebauer and Day, 1989; Stabeno et al., 2001, 2007), what the environmental effects are on the biota (Brodeur et al., 1999; Hunt et al., 2002; Kotwicki et al., 2005), what the consequences are for biodiversity and species interactions, and how long effects may be expected to last (Benson and Trites, 2002; Duffy\u2010Anderson et al., 2006) are critical to the evaluation of potential impacts of climate change.",

Winter sea\u2010ice concentration in the EBS has declined since the mid\u20101970s, but some marked fluctuations in yearly mean water column and sea surface temperatures (SST), manifested as alternating periods of variable duration, have been noted and classified as either \u2018warm\u2019 or \u2018cold\u2019 years (Stabeno et al., 2012a). Depth\u2010averaged spring and summer temperatures are closely related to the previous winter's temperatures and ice cover. Variations in depth\u2010averaged temperatures and timing of sea\u2010ice retreat directly influence the timing and location of the spring phytoplankton bloom and the availability, abundance, and species composition of zooplankton, particularly copepods, which are the primary components in the diets of fish larvae and juveniles (Hunt et al., 2011). During the previous decade, an unusual event occurred, characterized by five consecutive \u2018warm\u2019 years (2001\u20132005) followed by a \u2018normal\u2019 or transition year (2006) and four consecutive \u2018cold\u2019 years (2007\u20132010) (Stabeno et al., 2012a). This provides a unique opportunity to study the biological and physical processes of the EBS ecosystem in two different climatic \u2018regimes.\u2019 The temperatures recorded during this recent warm period are thought to be characteristic of those predicted by 2050 under a climate warming scenario (Stabeno et al., 2012b).",

Species composition, relative abundance, and length of larval and juvenile fishes in Bering Sea ichthyoplankton assemblages during summer are of particular interest as this is a period of ontogenetic transition for many species. For example, larvae of winter and spring spawning flatfish species are undergoing transformation and eye migration is nearly complete. Age\u20100 Theragra chalcogramma (walleye pollock), a commercially important gadid fish, form scales and begin to resemble adults in morphology and behavior (Brown et al., 2001), which includes forming schools and feeding at night (Merati and Brodeur, 1996; Sogard and Olla, 1996; Ryer and Olla, 1997, 1998). It is during this critical stage of development that many demersal fish species make the transition from pelagic to benthic habitats and are particularly vulnerable to mortality from predation and other causes (Toole et al., 1993). Survival of age\u20100 T. chalcogramma is linked to biochemical condition prior to onset of their first winter (Siddon et al., 2013; Heintz et al., 2013). Changes in the timing of transitions between early life history stages due to substantial shifts in prevailing environmental conditions may have significant consequences for survival and recruitment of certain species and the structure of species assemblages.",

To accomplish these objectives we adopted a two\u2010step approach. First, we undertook a within\u2010year examination of species assemblages during the most recent years of collection (2001\u20132005, 2007) and made quantitative and qualitative comparisons to assemblage structure from 1996\u20132000.

In July (and sometimes August) of each year (Table 1), a grid of stations on the EBS shelf was occupied, extending mostly eastward and south from the Pribilof Islands (Fig. 1). Conductivity\u2010temperature\u2010depth (CTD) casts were made immediately prior to fish sampling at nearly every station in each year. A modified beam trawl (MBT), with a 5\u2010m2 mouth opening fitted with a 3 \u00d7 2 mm oval mesh net and a 1\u2010mm mesh cod end, was towed obliquely from 200 m (or 10 m off bottom if shallower) to the surface. Net depth was measured using an acoustic netsonde. The MBT was designed to collect late larval and early juvenile stage fishes in the midwater and is similar to the Methot trawl (Methot, 1986). The MBT differs from the Methot trawl in not having a depressor and weight is contained within the tubular frame. A flowmeter was fitted into the mouth of the net frame to determine volume filtered. Samples were preserved in 5% formaldehyde\u2010seawater solution buffered with sodium borate. Because of the large mesh size of the MBT, preflexion and early flexion stage larvae of all species were likely not quantitatively sampled. Supplemental surface and bottom temperature data were obtained from AFSC annual bottom trawl surveys of the EBS shelf in summer (June\u2013August). Only temperature data collected from within the same geographic extent as the present study were used. Field collection methods generally follow those of Duffy\u2010Anderson et al. (2006).",

Removal of rare species was deemed appropriate because these were not likely to contribute significantly to the broader spatial and temporal patterns. Separate hierarchical clustering analyses for species and stations (using abundance as catch per 10 m2) were performed for each year using the Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity coefficient as the distance measure. A hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was used, specifically the flexible beta clustering method with beta = \u22120.25.

Two of these, Sebastes spp. and R. hippoglossoides, are deepwater or slope taxa, the latter being a pleuronectid with a circumpolar distribution that might be considered an indicator species affiliated with colder Arctic water masses (Mecklenberg et al., 2011). The abundance of R. hippoglossoides larvae declined somewhat during the warm period, suggesting a shift in prevailing oceanographic conditions (Fig. 10a). More frequent occurrences during the warm years (2001\u20132005) of larval L. bilineata, a pleuronectid with a more southerly range, may be indicative of a northern range expansion under conditions of rising temperatures (Fig. 10b). It should also be noted, however, that occurrences of adult L. bilineata in AFSC groundfish surveys are limited to only five stations immediately north and east of Unimak Island (Fig. 1) and the individuals collected were relatively small and probably not of spawning age (D. Stevenson, AFSC pers. com.). However, it is possible that larvae originating from adult L. bilineata spawning in the Gulf of Alaska are transported northward through Unimak Pass and onto the southeast Bering Sea shelf, as the prevailing currents are often very strong here with considerable seasonal and interannual variability (Stabeno et al., 2002; Duffy\u2010Anderson et al., 2006). It is not surprising that our 10 most abundant taxa apparently respond differently in terms of larval/juvenile abundance (see Table 7) to environmental influences, as this is most likely related to the evolutionary history of each taxon.",

Accordingly, we hypothesize that, given their sensitivity to environmental forcing, ichthyoplankton can be important early indicators of environmental change in the Bering Sea and potentially other subarctic seas as well. An interesting result derived from the previously published study (Duffy\u2010Anderson et al., 2006) was that assemblages in 1998 were significantly different from other years examined, and that a short\u2010term fluctuation in oceanographic conditions, the unusually strong 1997\u20131998 El Ni\u00f1o, appeared to disrupt predominant species assemblage patterns over the continental shelf, although effects were transitory. Lower larval abundances were also observed during the El Ni\u00f1o, with a return to previous levels the following year. Indeed, unique patterns were observed that appeared to be related to thermal conditions.",

This reduced the number of occurrences of Icelus spp. below the 4% threshold required for inclusion in the analysis. Psychrolutes spp. was included in the 5% group in the initial study, but only occurs in 2.6% of the 1996\u20132000 hauls in our taxonomically updated data set. In addition, Podothecus veternus was one of the agonid species collected in the recent sampling, not P. acipenserinus as previously reported.

It appears from our observations in 2007 that assemblage structure is more cohesive and boundaries between species and station clusters (groups) and oceanographic (thermal) fronts are more distinct than in \u2018warm\u2019 years. During the five consecutive \u2018warm\u2019 years (2001\u20132005), the early ice retreat likely led to low standing stocks of large zooplankton species, which may have limited overwinter survival of age\u20100 T. chalcogramma by depriving them of important energy\u2010rich prey resources in summer and autumn (Hunt et al., 2011). This hypothesis is based on more recent observations determining that cold conditions lead to greater production and availability of large higher\u2010energy\u2010content zooplankton such as the euphausiids Thysanoessa raschii and T. inermis and the copepod Calanus marshallae (Coyle et al., 2011). Although 2007 was the first \u2018cold\u2019 year after a transition (2006, an average year, unsampled) it had the lowest age\u20100 T. chalcogramma abundance over the entire time series. In addition, overall zooplankton availability in 2007 was high, but survival of the age\u20100 T. chalcogramma was low compared with subsequent cold years 2008\u20132010 (Heintz et al., 2013). One possible explanation for this is that the standing stock of larger zooplankton species with high lipid content had not yet fully recovered after several years of poor production to replace the smaller lipid poor species that were very abundant. Overwinter survival is also important for recruitment of these zooplankton species in the following year.",

Differences could be due to variations in larval supply, mortality, advection, and/or availability of nursery habitat, among other things. Moreover, observed trends in larval and juvenile abundance do not necessarily correlate with trends in age\u20101 recruitment estimates (Ianelli et al., 2010), suggesting that other factors also play a role in recruitment. Nevertheless, our results show that the early life history stages of marine fishes do respond to environmental perturbations relatively quickly, in terms of both changes in their abundances and/or changes in their species associations. The data we presented here encompass late larval, transformation, and early juvenile stages, but the influences of gradual environmental change or irregular \u2018disruptions\u2019 on spawning behavior (timing), hatching, and survival of earlier stages must also be considered as there are remnant or linked effects to later stages. Perhaps the most important conclusion from this study is that an 11\u2010yr time series is not long enough to fully understand the underlying mechanisms that influence change in ichthyoplankton assemblages and adult fish populations. As such, ichthyoplankton metrics remain useful harbingers of environmental variability and ecosystem change.",
