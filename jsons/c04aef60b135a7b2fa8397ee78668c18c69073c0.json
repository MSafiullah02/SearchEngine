            "text": "The respiratory epithelium comprises polarized cells at the interface between the environment and airway tissues. Polarized apical and basolateral protein secretions are a feature of airway epithelium homeostasis. Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is a major human pathogen that primarily targets the respiratory epithelium. However, the consequences of hRSV infection on epithelium secretome polarity and content remain poorly understood. To investigate the hRSV-associated apical and basolateral secretomes, a proteomics approach was combined with an ex vivo pediatric human airway epithelial (HAE) model of hRSV infection (data are available via Pro-teomeXchange and can be accessed at https://www.ebi. ac.uk/pride/ with identifier PXD013661). Following infection, a skewing of apical/basolateral abundance ratios was identified for several individual proteins. Novel modulators of neutrophil and lymphocyte activation (CXCL6, CSF3, SECTM1 or CXCL16), and antiviral proteins (BST2 or CEACAM1) were detected in infected, but not in uninfected cultures. Importantly, CXCL6, CXCL16, CSF3 were also detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hRSV-infected infants but not healthy controls. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of CEACAM1 against RSV was confirmed in vitro using BEAS-2B cells. hRSV infection disrupted the polarity of the pediatric respiratory epithelial secretome and was associated with immune modulating proteins (CXCL6, CXCL16, CSF3) never linked with this virus before. In addition, the antiviral activity of CEACAM1 against hRSV had also never been previously characterized. This study, therefore, provides novel insights into RSV pathogenesis and en-dogenous antiviral responses in pediatric airway epithelium.",

Apical secretions contain proteins associated with anti-oxidative, anti-protease, anti-microbial, and anti-inflammatory functions (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) , and provide the first line of defense against inhaled particulates, including bacteria and viruses. Analysis of respiratory secretions by proteomics demonstrated alterations of the protein composition in chronic airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 1 , asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF) (6 -9) . Moreover, proteome modifications were observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) or nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive adults (10) , and in hRSV-infected children (11) , respectively. The respiratory epithelium basolateral side juxtaposes deeper lung tissues. Proteins secreted basolaterally impact on the lung sub-epithelial structures and cells, such as serous/mucous glands, fibroblasts, smooth muscle, blood vessels or immune cells. Thus, alterations of the apical and basolateral airway secretions are likely to reflect pathogenic states and play a key role in disease progression.",

It has a high burden in children \u03fd5 years old, with \u03f334 million new ALRI episodes each year and up to 200,000 deaths (12) . hRSV primarily targets the respiratory epithelium and has been extensively characterized in a model of well-differentiated pediatric airway epithelial cell (HAE) cultures (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . In this system, the provision of an air-liquid interface to confluent human primary nasal or bronchial epithelial cells grown on solid permeable supports drives differentiation into pseudostratified columnar mucociliary epithelium that mimics the morphology, physiology and polarity of human respiratory epithelium in vivo (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . RSV infection of HAE cultures recapitulates many of the features associated with hRSV infection in vivo (reviewed in (21) ). However, the impact of hRSV infection of the airway epithelium on the overall protein secretome is unknown. Therefore, the HAE model provides an ideal platform to address the proteome of airway secretions, thereby providing extensive information on the molecular changes associated with infection. Importantly, HAE cultures provide easily accessible apical and basolateral sides, thereby allowing analysis of airway secretions in both directions, in contrast to NPAs or BALF, which, for practical reasons can only inform changes associated with the apicalfacing epithelial surface.",

In this study, SignalP4.1 (http://www.cbs. dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), an update from SignalP4.0 (30), Phobius (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/) (31), SPOCTOPUS (http://octopus. cbr.su.se/index.php) (32) and TMHMM2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/TMHMM/) (33) were used to identify proteins predicted to carry SPs and/or TMs, and secretomeP2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/SecretomeP/) (34) to distinguish proteins secreted in a nonclassical fashion, all using default settings (35) . SignalP4.1 and TMHMM2.0 only focused on the prediction of SP or TM, respectively, whereas Phobius and SPOCTOPUS combined the prediction of SP and TM (Phobius SP/TM and SPOCTOPUS SP/TM). All five algorithms are trained against specific data sets to discriminate between the type of protein feature or the secretory pathway involved. These programs were used to classify proteins following a majority-decision based method, whereby at least two out of three methods must predict that a protein carries a specific topological feature (supplemental Fig. S3 ). Therefore, all identified proteins in the apical wash and basolateral medium of mock-and hRSV BT2a-infected WD-PBEC cultures were organized accordingly as secreted via a signal peptide, secreted in a non-classical pathway, membrane or intracellular proteins. When required, exosome analysis was performed by searching the Exocarta database (http://www.exocarta.org/) (36) .",

Virus release was detected in apical rinses at 24 hpi and peaked at 96 hpi (Fig. 1A) . hRSV primarily infected ciliated cells but not goblet cells ( Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1 ). There was no obvious CPE observed in cultures from any donor (data not shown). To further extend these findings, the presence of viral proteins was investigated by LC-MS/MS analysis of apical and basolateral samples collected at 96 hpi from mockand hRSV-infected cultures. Five viral proteins were identified by at least two unique peptides, in infected cultures only from all donors. These included the hRSV matrix (M), fusion (F0), phosphoprotein (P), nucleoprotein (N), M2-1 proteins, in order of abundance (Table I) . The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) protein was detected in samples from 2 donors. In general, detection was restricted to the apical side, and confirmed by Western blotting analyses for viral proteins (Fig. 1C) . Unexpectedly, hRSV M protein was detected by LC-MS/MS in the basolateral medium from one donor (Table I) , but was not confirmed by Western blotting. Overall, these findings were consistent with the viral growth kinetics and the strict apical release of virions previously reported for hRSV in HAE models of adult or pediatric origin, and for both nasal and bronchial cells (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) .",

B, At 120 h post-infection (hpi) cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, ciliated, goblet and infected cells were stained with anti-\u2424-tubulin (red), anti-Muc5ac (white) and FITC-conjugated anti-RSV (green) antibodies, respectively. Cultures were examined by fluorescent microscopy at x63 magnification. C, Apical washes and basolateral medium collected at 96 hpi from infected cultures, and pooled samples from mock-infected cultures were analyzed individually by Western blotting (12 l/lane). Ten l/lane of a sucrose-gradient purified hRSV A2 stock was used as control. Immunoblot analyses was carried out using a polyclonal anti-hRSV antibody (upper panel) and monoclonal antibodies specific for the matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein (N), fusion (F) and M2-1 (lower panel), followed by appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for enhanced chemiluminescence detection. from mock-and hRSV-infected WD-PBEC cultures (96 hpi). A total of 959 host proteins were identified by at least 2 unique peptides and in cultures from \u05462 donors (supplemental Table  S6 ). Unexpectedly, based on their predicted topology, intracellular (n \u03ed 437) and membrane (n \u03ed 129) proteins represented more than half the protein pool (Figs. 2A and supplemental Fig. S3) , as opposed to mainly secreted proteins (n \u03ed 257, signal peptide; n \u03ed 136 non-classical pathway), and this was also observed in the apical and basolateral sides separately (supplemental Fig. S4) . A GOCC enrichment analysis (Fisher exact test, Benjamini-hochberg FDR 0.1%) further validated this finding. In control and infected cultures, proteins predicted to be intracellular, membrane or secreted were mostly enriched in proteins assigned to cell parts/cytoplasm, the plasma membrane or the extracellular space/vesicle lumen, respectively, and the converse was true with regards to the depleted proteins (Fig. 2B) . Although intriguing, the detection of many intracellular, membrane and unconventionally secreted proteins in apical and basolateral secretions was in line with other reports (1, 3, 5, 39) . Their presence could be a consequence of cell sloughing, particularly in the apical side during hRSV infection (14 -17) , or of exosomal secretion, which is a feature of differentiated HAE (2) and hRSV-infected undifferentiated epithelial cells from the bronchial and small airway (40) . Indeed, an overlap with a human exosome database (n \u03ed 6516, http://www.exocarta.org/) revealed that 413 intracellular (out of 437), 111 membrane (out of 129) and 119 (out of 136) unconventionally secreted proteins had been identified in previous exosomal data sets (Fig. 2C) . This is consistent with the presence of these proteins in the basolateral secretome, considering the physical separation between cells and medium. were combined and categorized into proteins secreted via a signal peptide or in a non-classical pathway, and cellular proteins with either intracellular or membrane localization.

A hierarchical clustering of the abundance patterns clearly validated this dichotomy ( Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S6A) , confirming a polarized secretome. Interestingly, basic homeostatic processes were distinct between the apical and basolateral secretomes of uninfected cultures, as revealed by a GOBP enrichment analysis performed on unique and enriched proteins (Fisher exact test, p value \u03fd 0.01). The apical secretome was signif-icantly associated with proteins involved in lipid metabolism, o-glycosylation, signaling, transport, regulation of cell activation, calcium/ion homeostasis, response to stimulus, regulation of enzymes activity, sugar metabolism, cellular processes and other BPs (supplemental Fig. S7A and S7B ). In contrast, the basolateral proteins were significantly associated with the regulation of metabolic and cellular processes, the regulation of cell death, cell contraction/movement and various metabolic and other pathways (supplemental Fig. S7C and S7D) .

Altered abundance ratios were also observed for several of the proteins significantly enriched under normal homeostatic conditions (Fig. 4B and supplemental Table S6 ). Moreover, many of those affected proteins were associated with biological processes (BPs) enriched under healthy conditions (supplemental Table S7 ). For instance in the apical side, affected BP groups included calcium/ion homeostasis, lipid or sugar metabolism, signaling, and responses to chemical or mechanical stimuli. Similarly, altered basolateral proteins were implicated mainly in various cellular/ metabolic processes and their regulation, and the regulation of cell death. These data suggested that hRSV perturbed several homeostatic BPs by affecting the protein equilibrium between apical and basolateral sides and, by extension, disrupted normal airway epithelium functions.",

Functional classification showed that most of the 13 undetectable proteins were involved in physiological processes, such as cell communication, signal transduction and transport (Fig. 5B) . Of note, groups of BPs involving calcium/ ion transport and o-glycosylation were affected via the loss of SLC2A1/ATP6V1E1 and MUC13, respectively (supplemental Table S7 ). hRSV-induced proteins were mainly implicated in energy pathways, metabolism, signal transduction, cell communication and immune responses (Fig. 5C ). Of these, 17 proteins were associated with significantly enriched BPs indicative of viral infection: immune processes, response to stimulus, cell migration and the negative regulation of cell differentiation ( Fig. 6 and supplemental Table S9 ). They included several neutrophil (CXCL6, CXCL10, and IL6) and lung T cell (CXCL16) chemoattractants (41), a neutrophil growth factor (CSF3) and 2 proteins with antiviral properties against Influenza or hMPV (BST2 and CEACAM1) (37, 38, 42) . In addition, SECTM1, which is implicated in signal transduction and cell communication (Fig. 5C ), was previously identified as a neutrophil activator (43) . As a major pathological component of hRSV-induced disease is the large infiltration of neutrophils in the lungs (44) , these data are extremely relevant in the context of hRSV pathophysiology.

To determine whether CEACAM1 has antiviral activity against hRSV, BEAS-2B cells were infected with hRSV/eGFP (MOI \u03ed 3) in the presence or absence of serial dilutions of an antibody that blocks CEACAM1 function (37, 38) . BEAS-2B is a more relevant epithelial cell line (compared with A549) to study RSV and has been shown to express CEACAM1 (49, 50) . Anti-CEACAM1 treatment led to a significant increase in fluorescence intensity supplemental Fig. S9A , S9B, and S9C) and percentage of fluorescence coverage of the monolayer (supplemental Fig.  S9D and S9E) which resulted in an accelerated hRSV release at 48 hpi, compared with controls ( Fig. 8A and 8B ). This effect was dependent on the Ab dilution and the time of infection. eGPF intensity and percentage of coverage are surrogates for RSV gene transcription kinetics whereas virus TCID 50 titrations measure replication-competent virus release, and virus transcription evidently occurs before assembly and release. Therefore, peak effects of anti-CEACAM1 treatment on RSV replication at 24 hpi (eGFP intensities and coverage) and at 48 hpi (TCID 50 titrations) is consistent with the relative kinetics of gene transcription and virus release These data are consistent with an antiviral activity of CEACAM1 against hRSV.

NPA use was dictated by appropriate sample availability. However, although the WD-PBEC cultures were derived from tracheobronchial cells, NPA clinical samples were considered appropriate, as evidence suggests that nasal epithelium is an appropriate surrogate for bronchial epithelium in relation to hRSV infection (17) . The concentrations of CXCL6 (Fig. 9A ) and CXCL16 (Fig. 9C) were significantly increased in NPAs from hRSV-positive infants. There was a small but significant correlation between CXCL6 concentrations and viral load (Ct values) in NPAs (Fig. 9B) , suggesting that the release of CXCL6 might be dependent on the kinetic of viral replication. Similarly, CSF3 was detected by Western blotting in most samples from sick children compare with controls ( Fig. 9D-9F) . Furthermore, hRSV matrix protein was detected by Western blotting only in hRSV-positive samples with Ct values \u03fd20 cycles. DISCUSSION The proteome of airway secretions was unknown in the context of an acute respiratory virus infections. This study determined the impact of hRSV on the protein composition of airway epithelium secretions. For this purpose, WD-PBECs were infected with a clinical isolate of hRSV (BT2a), or mock-infected, and the apical and basolateral secretomes were profiled using quantitative proteomics.",

This was primarily evidenced by the altered polarity of secretion of a large panel of proteins (Fig. 4) , encompassing multiple biological processes, and was indicative of a potentially dysfunctional epithelial barrier. Indeed, such epithelial leakage resembles the increased paracellular permeability observed in HAE cultures originating from asthmatic patients (51) or in polarized monolayers with CF defects (52) . In those models, disruption of epithelial tight junction integrity was evident, and was associated with decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased permeability to fluorescently labeled macromolecules. Interestingly, these effects were also noted after hRSV infection in polarized respiratory epithelial cell monolayers (53) , and bronchial, but not nasal, HAE cultures (17, 18) . One consequence of a \"leaky\" epithelium, in the HAE model at least, was to exacerbate an otherwise compartmentalized inflammatory response (54, 55) , by increasing the exposure of sub-epithelial tissues to luminal antigens (allergens and immunogenic ligands).",

            "text": "Furthermore, disordered immune responses is consistent with the exacerbated inflammation of the bronchiolar and alveolar regions observed in severe hRSV-associated pathologies (reviewed in (56)). hRSV-associated inflammation is thought to be Th2-mediated and characterized by a large infiltration of neutrophils in the airways (44), consistent with elevated IL-6, CXCL8, and CXCL10 responses (15, 45, 46) . Altered CXCL6, CSF3, SECTM1, and CXCL16 secretions were, therefore, highly relevant in this context considering their functions as modulators of neutrophil and T cell activity (Fig. 5) . Conversely, the loss of MUC13 secretion following infection was intriguing because it is a transmembrane mucosal protein with pro-inflammatory properties (57) . CSF3 is a neutrophil growth factor, whereas CXCL6 is chemotactic for neutrophils and binds the same receptors as CXCL8 (CXCR1/ CXCR2) (58) . SECTM1 is a membrane/secreted airway epithelium-derived protein that was shown to sustain an amplifying loop of neutrophilic inflammation during pneumococcal pneumonia (43) . CXCL16 is an epithelium-derived chemokine that recruits and activates lung T cells via the CXCR6 receptor (59) . CXCL6 and CXCL16 were particularly noteworthy because of their increased concentrations in NPAs from hRSVpositive children (Fig. 9A and 9C ) and their association with several chronic lung pathologies, such as idiopathic pulmo-nary fibrosis (IPF), CF, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and asthma. In CF and CRS patients, CXCL6 was detected in lung epithelium goblet cells and was a more potent neutrophil chemoattractant than CXCL8, whereas treatment with an anti-CXCL6 antibody reduced neutrophil influx and inflammation in a mouse model of IPF (59 -63) . Similarly, CXCR6 was expressed on lung-infiltrating Th2 cells in a mouse model of asthma (62) and in asthmatic patients (61) . In addition, whereas MUC13 exacerbated the responsiveness of intestinal epithelial cell lines to multiple TLR ligands, leading to increased IL-8 and TNF-\u2423 production (57), its expression was only up-regulated in NPAs from patients with severe hRSVassociated disease, in contrast to milder cases (64) . Overall, our data suggest that CXCL6, CXCL16, CSF3 and, to a lesser extent, SECTM1 and MUC13, may constitute important but previously unidentified drivers/modulators of neutrophil infiltration and recruitment and/or activation of Th2 cells to the lungs during acute hRSV infection. FIG. 9 . Detection of host and viral proteins in NPAs from hRSV-positive children. NPA samples from hRSVA-positive (n \u03ed 6) and hRSVB-positive (n \u03ed 6) infants were analyzed by ELISA and Western blotting and compared with non-infected control. Samples were collected and prepared as per methods. CXCL6 quantities (A) were measured by ELISA, and correlation between CXCL6 concentration and viral load (Ct values) was calculated by linear regression analysis (B). CXCL16 quantities (C) were also measured by ELISA. Eight g protein/lane were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against hRSV M protein and CSF3. Patient numbers are indicated above (See supplemental Table  S10 ) (D, E, F). Whole cell lysate from hRSV A2-infected HEp-2 cells was used as a positive control (\u03e9). Ct values from the diagnostic tests are indicated. Statistical significance was established using a Mann-Whitney test.",

            "text": "In addition to identifying novel hRSV-induced mediators associated with recruitment of immunopathogenic immune cells, this work also highlighted direct cytophysiological and antiviral responses of airway epithelium to hRSV infection. For example, BST2 and CEACAM1, which have known antiviral properties against HIV, influenza virus or hMPV, were specifically induced upon hRSV infection (37, 38, 42) and in the case of CEACAM1 this correlated with previous data in A549 and undifferentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells (49) . Importantly, this is the first description of the involvement of CEACAM1 in anti-hRSV defense (Fig. 8) . Like BST2, CEACAM1 is normally a membrane-associated protein, but its secretion may be explained by soluble isoforms of the protein (48) . Active cleavage of native CEACAM1 from cell surfaces is also possible, especially in such a protease-rich environment. In this study, CEACAM1 was identified as a novel secreted factor with antiviral properties against hRSV in the epithelium environment. Another novel observation was the loss of detection of two membrane transporters, SLC2A2 and ATPV6E6, which are involved in maintaining cation/Ca 2\u03e9 homeostasis ( Fig. 5A and supplemental Table S8 ). Indeed, efficient mucociliary clearance relies essentially on coordinated cilia movement, which is partly controlled by tight regulation of intracellular and extracellular levels of Ca 2\u03e9 (65, 66) . Altering the expression/secretion of these host factors suggests that hRSV might affect Ca 2\u03e9 levels, which in turn could lead to dysregulation of cilia beating. This is consistent with the ability of hRSV to induce cilia beating dyskinesia, at least in the HAE model (18) . A reduced mucociliary clearance may indeed exacerbate hRSVassociated pathologies because it drives the transport of inhaled particles and pathogens trapped in the mucus out of the airways and toward the oropharynx.",
