            "text": "Although gene coevolution has been widely observed within individuals and between different organisms, rarely has this phenomenon been investigated within a phylogenetic framework. The Geraniaceae is an attractive system in which to study plastid-nuclear genome coevolution due to the highly elevated evolutionary rates in plastid genomes. In plants, the plastidencoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is a protein complex composed of subunits encoded by both plastid (rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1, and rpoC2) and nuclear genes (sig1-6). We used transcriptome and genomic data for 27 species of Geraniales in a systematic evaluation of coevolution between genes encoding subunits of the PEP holoenzyme. We detected strong correlations of dN (nonsynonymous substitutions) but not dS (synonymous substitutions) within rpoB/sig1 and rpoC2/sig2, but not for other plastid/nuclear gene pairs, and identified the correlation of dN/dS ratio between rpoB/C1/C2 and sig1/5/6, rpoC1/C2 and sig2, and rpoB/C2 and sig3 genes. Correlated rates between interacting plastid and nuclear sequences across the Geraniales could result from plastid-nuclear genome coevolution. Analyses of coevolved amino acid positions suggest that structurally mediated coevolution is not the major driver of plastid-nuclear coevolution. The detection of strong correlation of evolutionary rates between SIG and RNAP genes suggests a plausible explanation for plastome-genome incompatibility in Geraniaceae.",

Coevolution may be detected within a single organism, such as gene pairs with known physical interactions in Escherichia coli (Pazos and Valencia, 2001) , or between organisms, such as the correlated change of sequences between viral and host genes (Lobo et al., 2009) . The coevolution of genes from organellar and nuclear genomes may be considered an intermediate case, in which the genes of interest are within the same organism but are encoded in different cellular compartments. Given that there is an order of magnitude higher mutation rate in nuclear genomes compared with plastid genomes in plants (Wolfe et al., 1987; Drouin et al., 2008) , the detection of correlation in evolutionary rates, and how that correlation is maintained, presents an interesting area of study.",

If mutual selective pressure exists between two genes, changes to the amino acid sequences encoded in one gene would be expected to cause corresponding changes in the other gene to maintain normal biological activity (Pazos and Valencia, 2008) . Similarly, coevolution between two genes can be evaluated based on the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN), which are nucleotide mutations that cause a change in the amino acid sequences. However, dN is also affected by local rate heterogeneity or local background mutation rates, represented by the rate of synonymous substitutions (dS), which do not result in amino acid changes. The correlation of dS between two genes is more likely due to a shared mutation rate than an indicator of coevolution.",

Because the evolutionary rate of the mammalian mitochondrial genome is much higher than that of the nuclear genome, studies of correlated evolution between organellar and nuclear genomes have focused on proteins of enzyme complexes with subunits encoded in each of these compartments. Using this approach, studies have shown that some nuclear genes that encode products that participate in mitochondrial-localized complexes have a corresponding higher evolutionary rate relative to cytosol targeted nuclear gene products (Willett and Burton, 2004; Osada and Akashi, 2012; Barreto and Burton, 2013; Zhang and Broughton, 2013) .",

Various methods have been developed that incorporate the effects of phylogeny for detecting gene coevolution (Pazos and Valencia, 2008; de Juan et al., 2013; Rao et al., 2014) . The mirror tree method (Pazos and Valencia, 2001) was originally introduced to predict protein-protein interactions, and it quantifies rate correlations by estimating the similarities of corresponding phylogenetic trees. For each gene tree, the evolutionary rates on each branch are extracted to form a rate vector, and Pearson correlation coefficients are calculated between the rate vectors of two genes. Despite its popularity, the original mirror tree method does not effectively account for underlying phylogenetic histories. Different modifications of this method were developed to remove the effects of shared phylogeny by introducing a correction factor (Pazos et al., 2005; Sato et al., 2005) . A more recent likelihood based approach evaluates the coevolution between genes using normalized dN, or dN/dS (Clark and Aquadro, 2010) . In this method, the likelihoods of three models (null, correlated, and free) are calculated and the correlation is quantified as the proportional improvement of the likelihood of the correlated model to the null model, with respect to the maximal possible improvement gained by the free model over the null model.",

Dutheil and Galtier (2007) developed an approach (CoMap) that examines the coevolution of given amino acid sites using the known phylogenetic history. In this method, the ancestral state of a given amino acid site is inferred from the phylogenetic history and the sequence of changes that occur across time (branches on a phylogenetic tree) form a substitution vector. Structurally mediated coevolution of any amino acid site is then evaluated using the substitution vector and a cluster-based approach (Dutheil and Galtier, 2007) . Another approach studies the coevolved amino acids by incorporating a continuous-time Markov process model (Yeang and Haussler, 2007) . Both of these approaches agree well with experimental results; however, the latter approach is computationally demanding and therefore more feasible for studies of small protein domains.",

Studies in Geraniaceae have revealed highly elevated evolutionary rates in the plastid genome, especially in rpoB, rpoC1, and rpoC2 (Guisinger et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2012) , and highly divergent rpoA sequences in the genus Pelargonium (Chumley et al., 2006) . The interaction of SIG and RNAP gene products provides an attractive platform for the study of coevolution between the two genomes. Using transcriptomic and genomic data from 27 species with a well-established phylogenetic framework, the entire sigma factor gene family in Geraniaceae has been characterized and a systematic correlation analysis of evolutionary rates between plastid and nuclear genomes was conducted. Despite an order of magnitude difference in the mutation rate between these two genomes (Wolfe et al., 1987; Drouin et al., 2008) , we detected a correlation of evolutionary rates among 27 species representing the entire family. Furthermore, analyses of interacting amino acid pairs suggest that structurally mediated coevolution plays a minimal role in maintaining the coordination of evolutionary rates. The identification of rate correlations between RNAP and SIG genes suggests a plausible explanation for the observed plastome-genome incompatibility within Pelargonium and possibly other genera of flowering plants.",

Application of the PCA method produced correlations of dN and dS that were similar to those from the average by all method except that correlation of dN was detected between rpl14/rpoA and sig1 ( Figure 4C ). None of the three methods identified correlation of dS between RNAP and SIG genes ( Figures 4A to 4C) , suggesting that the correlation of dN was not due to the effects of background mutation rates.

To examine saturation of synonymous sites, values of dN and dS were plotted and linear/quadratic models were used to fit the data. If dS is saturated, the quadratic model with a concave curve should fit the data better. The two models were compared with the improvement of sum of squares explained by these models (Fares and Wolfe, 2003; Weng et al., 2014) .

Since the b9 subunit of the cyanobacterial ancestor was split in the lineage leading to plants (Shiina et al., 2005) , the relevant residues from the b9 and b99 subunits in plants were combined for comparison with the b9 subunit in E. coli. The interaction sites between SIG and RNAP subunits were predicted by contact map analysis (Sobolev et al., 2005) and by estimation of the physical distance between two interacting residues. More interaction sites were predicted by contact map analysis than by distance estimation (Supplemental Table 7) ; however, few (0 to 20%) of the predicted coevolving amino acid sites overlapped with interaction sites (Supplemental Table 7 ). The analysis of distance distributions across the coevolved amino acid pairs suggested that among the 4223 residue pairs predicted to be involved in structurally mediated coevolution by CoMap, only one pair had a distance of <5 \u00c5. The analyses of structurally mediated coevolution within amino acid pairs showed a minimal overlap between coevolved and interacting amino acid sites (Supplemental Table 7 ), with few of the coevolved residues in close physical proximity (<5 \u00c5; Supplemental Figure 11 ).",

Duplications of SIG genes have been documented in several angiosperms, including maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) (Lerbs-Mache, 2011). These duplicate copies may be functionally diversified to regulate gene expression at different developmental stages or under changing environmental conditions as seen for the duplicated sig1 of maize that is differentially expressed in etiolated leaves (Tan and Troxler, 1999; Lerbs-Mache, 2011) . The pattern of SIG gene duplication in Geraniaceae could have arisen in The entire sequence of each gene was used in this analysis (see Methods). The correlation of dN and dS values were calculated by modifications of the mirror tree method average method (all) (A), average method (separation) (B), and PCA (C). All interaction pairs with a correlation coefficient of higher than 0.6 were considered significant and shown with a blue square. RNAP and SIG genes, highlighted in blue and orange fonts, respectively, show strong correlation of dN but not dS (highlighted in orange shaded box). Little to no correlation of dN between RNAP/SIG genes and the control genes (in black font) was detected. Gene names and cellular locations corresponding to each number are given below the diagram.",

Polyploidy is widespread across Geraniaceae (Widler-Kiefer and Yeo, 1987; Yu and Horn, 1988; Touloumenidou et al., 2007) and has likely contributed to duplication of SIG genes. However, an alternative explanation, that multiple, small-scale gene duplications have occurred (Davis and Petrov, 2004; Li et al., 2006) was supported by the pattern of SIG gene duplications observed in Geraniaceae (Supplemental Figures 2 and 3) . Multiple gene losses were detected in the SIG gene family in Geraniales. While it is possible that these genes are so lowly expressed as to fall below the level of detection, the high depth of coverage in transcriptome sequencing and the fact that the same genes were identified in transcriptomes of closely related species make this unlikely. The Sig4 protein specifically recognizes the promoter of ndhF, which encodes a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase in the plastid (Endo et al., 1999; Favory et al., 2005) . The lack of sig4 transcripts in E. chrysanthum and E. gruinum is plausible given the loss of ndh genes from the plastid genomes of these species (Chris Blazier et al., 2011) . The identification of a sig4 pseudogene in M. villosus also correlates with a recent loss of ndh genes in that species (Weng et al., 2014) . The loss of both sig4 and ndh genes provides an explicit example of coevolution between the plastid and nuclear genomes.",

Studies of coevolution usually focus on protein sequences from multisubunit enzyme complexes. Correlated change of evolutionary rates has been widely observed in various organisms (Campo et al., 2008; Pazos and Valencia, 2008; Lovell and Robertson, 2010) . A previous study showed that nuclear genes encoding subunits of enzyme complexes that assemble in the mitochondria with subunits encoded in the organelle have significantly higher evolutionary rates than genes whose products are targeted to the cytosol (Barreto and Burton, 2013) . Likewise, analyses of coevolution between organellar and nuclear genomes have mainly focused on genes from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes (Zhang and Broughton, 2013; Barreto and Burton, 2013) . A recent study of Silene (Sloan et al., 2014) suggested that coevolution occurred between plastid and nuclear genomes based on the observation of elevated protein sequence divergence in organelle targeted, but not cytosolic, ribosomal proteins for species with fast evolving mitochondrial and plastid genomes. The unusually high substitution rates of genes in the plastid genomes of Geraniaceae (Chumley et al., 2006; Guisinger et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2012 ) provide an attractive system for the study of coevolution. Using both transcriptome and genome data and a well-characterized phylogenetic framework, this systematic analysis revealed the existence of correlation of evolutionary rates, evidence of coevolution between plastid and nuclear genomes at different levels (dN and dN/dS).",

If the first explanation were correct, rate correlations between RNAP and SIG genes could be due to structurally mediated compensatory evolution. However, results suggest that structurally mediated coevolution plays a minor role in maintaining rate correlations between SIG and RNAP subunits and other factors contributing to compensatory evolution could not be excluded. Shared functional constraint is another agent that may be maintaining the observed correlations. Additional study is required to further elucidate the contribution of functional constraints, gene expression, or other factors in the correlation of evolutionary rates of PEP subunits in Geraniaceae.",

Various mechanisms have been proposed for PGI, including impaired interactions between cis-elements and their cognate nuclear factors involved in transcription and/or transcript stability. In Oenothera, perturbations of photosystem II activity, presumed to be caused by changes in transcription of the psbB gene, contributes to PGI (Greiner et al., 2008) . Likewise, steady state RNA levels of three PEP-controlled genes were severely reduced in leaf sections taken from variegated, interspecific hybrids of Zantedeschia (Yao and Cohen, 2000) . The two nuclear genes included in the Zantedeschia study also evidenced low levels of mRNA; expression of cab and rbsS is known to be regulated by retrograde plastid to nuclear signals and would therefore be susceptible to the PGI phenotype (Ruckle et al., 2007) . Correlation of accelerated nucleotide substitution rates between SIG and RNAP genes provides a plausible explanation for PGI in Geraniaceae (Weihe et al., 2009; Greiner et al., 2011) . Specifically, the high evolutionary rates and rate correlation between SIG and RNAP genes within species could lead to interspecific incompatibilities, and such incompatibilities would reduce efficiency or even cause dysfunction of the PEP holoenzyme, impairing the transcription of essential plastid genes. The role of sigma factors in transcription initiation through ciselement binding and polymerase recruitment suggests similarity between the Geraniaceae, Zantedeschia, and Oenothera PGI systems. The correlation of dN/dS was quantified using proportional improvement (Clark and Aquadro, 2010) . Interaction pairs with a proportional improvement of higher than 0.6 were considered significant and shown with a blue square in the figure. RNAP and SIG genes, highlighted in blue and orange fonts, respectively, show strong correlation of dN/dS (highlighted in orange shaded box). Little to no correlation of dN/dS between RNAP/SIG genes and the control genes (in black font) was detected. Gene names corresponding to each number are given below the diagram.",

Specifically, the evolutionary rates, dN or dS, on each branch of a given gene tree were collected to form a rate vector. The rate correlation was quantified using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the rate vectors of different genes. The rate vector of each gene pair was adjusted via vector projection by a correction vector representing the shared phylogenetic effects prior to the comparison. The correction vector was generated with different modifications of the mirror tree method, the average method, and PCA (Sato et al., 2005) . In the average method, the correction vector was determined in two ways, the average by all and the average by separation, in which either the correction vector was defined as the average of rate vectors of all genes or two different correction vectors for nuclear and plastid genes were defined separately, as the average of rate vectors of corresponding gene groups. In PCA, the correction vector was calculated as the first principle component of the rate matrix formed by rate vectors of all genes.",

Specifically, the evolutionary rates and the likelihood of three (correlated, null, and free) models for the estimated rates of each gene pair were evaluated with HYPHY, and the proportional improvement method estimates correlation of dN/dS ratio by calculating the proportional improvement of likelihood of the correlated model over the null model, with respect to the maximal possible improvement gained by the free model over the null model (Clark and Aquadro, 2010) . The remaining interaction pairs (3/450, psbC and psaA, psbC/psaA and nprb7) were analyzed using the same batch script template with modifications so that the likelihoods of the correlation model with different start points (20.8, 1, and 1.3) were optimized separately rather than sequentially.
