            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a common, highly contagious, and acute viral disease of poultry. The disease is caused by a coronavirus known as IB virus (IBV). The virus initiates infection via the respiratory tract and replicates in various types of epithelial cells, including those of the kidney, gonads, and alimentary tract (Villegas, 1998; Saif et al., 2011) . After the identification of the virus, a high diversity among isolates was reported, not only in antigenicity, but also in pathogenicity, and the nature of this virus motivated researchers to develop an efficient way to classify the isolates (Hofstad, 1958; Gelb et al., 1991; Lee et al., 2008) .",

It is based on sequence analysis of the S1 portion of the S protein gene, which encodes the virus-neutralizing epitope and is responsible for viral attachment to cells (Ma et al., 2012) . At least 3 genotypes of IBV have been identified in Korea by S1 sequence analysis (Lim et al., 2012) . The KII type, one of the antigenic clusters of the Korean isolates, has frequently been isolated in field outbreaks and is related to nephropathogenic Chinese IBV strains (e.g., the ch/QXIBV strain; Lee et al., 2008) . The rapid detection of variant isolates is the strongest aspect of the S1 sequence analysis method. However, because the presumed tissue tropism from this system is not always in agreement with the actual tissue tropism (Sapats et al., 1996) , a more detailed understanding of the immunopathogenesis of IB infections is required. Such an understanding will enable scientists to be prepared for the emergence of variants with unusual tissue tropisms (Raj and Jones, 1997) .",

The diversity of this virus has been verified by sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, but this method must be supplemented with further analysis for characterization of the agent. To increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease caused by this virus, we investigated the response of chickens to 2 IBV with different genotypes, KIIa and ChVI. The clinical signs induced by the viruses were observed. In addition, the mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 factor and the serum levels of \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein, which is a major acute phase protein, were measured. The KIIa genotype (Kr/ADL110002/2011) induced clinical signs accompanied by the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a higher viral load. In chickens infected with this isolate, simultaneous peaks in the viral copy number and cytokine production were observed at 7 dpi in the trachea and 9 d postinoculation in the kidney. On the other hand, the chickens infected with the ChVI genotype (Kr/ ADL120003/2012) did not show a response other than a mild upregulation of cytokines at 1 d postinoculation, which appears to indicate the invasion of the virus. In summary, we confirmed a differential innate response following infection with distinct IBV. We hypothesize that an excessive innate response contributes to the scale of the pathophysiologic effect in chickens.",

            "text": "correlation between immunopathogenesis and disease progress is widely accepted in diverse studies. In the case of severe acute respiratory diseases, such as SARS, immunopathogenesis has been suggested to contribute to disease progression, providing the rationale for therapy with corticosteroids (Mu\u00f1oz-Fernandez, 2004) . During H5N1 influenza infection, an excessive cytokine level in the blood and the innate immune response were suggested to play a role in disease progression Peiris et al., 2004) . In poultry, a role for cytokines in disease progression was suggested in Marek's disease, mycoplasmosis, salmonellosis, and coccidiosis (Laurent et al., 2001; Swaggerty et al., 2004; Withanage et al., 2004; Jarosinski et al., 2005; Mohammed et al., 2007) . Especially in IB infections, analyzing the correlation between immunopathogenesis and disease progression appears to be valid and effective, considering that the severity of IB infection depends significantly on host factors such as immune status, age, and breed. In a previous study, the renal disease induced by an IB isolate was reproduced at different scales according to the age of the infected chickens (Dolz et al., 2012) . The discrepancy in pathogenicity among different genetic lines of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens following the same nephropathogenic strain has also been documented (Otsuki et al., 1990; Ignjatovic et al., 2003) .",

Briefly, the isolate of the KIIa genotype (kr/ADL110002/2011) was isolated from kidneys of 3-wk-old broilers suffering from severe nephritis, respiratory signs, and increased mortality (1% per day). According to S1 sequence analysis, this isolate belongs to the KIIa type, which is closely related to the QX-IB strain. The isolate of the ChVI genotype (kr/ ADL120003/2012) was derived from 38-wk-old layers with a slight decrease in egg production. This genotype (ChVI) does not belong to major clusters of Korean IB isolates but appears to be derived from a Chinese strain (Liu et al., 2006) . The virus stock for the challenge study was produced by inoculating field isolates into embryonated SPF chicken eggs via the allantoic cavity and collecting the infectious allantoic fluid 72 h postinoculation. Reverse-transcription (RT) PCR targeting the IBV S1 gene was carried out, and each 630-bp S1 amplicon was sequenced for genotyping by the direct sequencing method. The median embryo infective dose (EID 50 ) was determined by the Reed and Munch formula. The isolates were shown to be free from contamination by other avian pathogens by inoculating 3-wk-old SPF chicks and testing their sera at least 2 wk later using the procedures for the accreditation of SPF flocks. In this preliminary experiment, the chickens inoculated with the isolate kr/ADL110002/2011 showed severe nephritis after prolonged infection (>14 d), whereas no significant clinical symptoms were observed in chickens inoculated with the same dose of the isolate kr/ADL120003/2012.",

The KIIa genotype (kr/ADL110002/2011), which is closely related to the nephropathogenic strain, induced clinical symptoms of depression and a stronger pro-inflammatory response. On the other hand, an active infection of the ChVI genotype isolate kr/ADL120003/2012, which resulted in an increase in serum AGP level at 9 dpi (Table 3) , evoked only a limited range of pro-inflammatory responses. According to the data collected at 9 dpi, the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was temporally associated with clinical signs related to renal damage, such as an increased drinking of water and lesions observed in the kidney, including renal tubular necrosis. These data suggest that excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production contributes to disease severity. In particular, the excessive production of IL-6 in IB infections was already suspected to contribute to the exaggerated disease severity in specific genetic lines (Asif et al., 2007) . Our data have different implications than the results of that study; we have demonstrated that specific IB genotypes induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and that differences in the scale of the induction could contribute to the disease severity induced by IBV of diverse genotypes.",

            "text": "In addition to the IL-6 profiling, it was meaningful to observe the pattern of change in the levels of 2 cy-tokines, IL-1\u03b2 and LITAF, during IB infection because these immune mediators do not act alone in vivo (Perrone et al., 2008) . In chickens, LITAF has been investigated as a substitute for TNF-\u03b1 in viral infections (Ruby et al., 2006; Esnault et al., 2011) , even though its involvement in viral infections was not demonstrated. In mammals, LITAF was reported to regulate TNF-\u03b1 gene expression (Myokai et al., 1999) and to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tang et al., 2005b) . It is still debatable whether LITAF could be used as an indicator during viral infection, but our findings at 9 dpi demonstrate the upregulation of LITAF following IB infection, so a subsequent increase in transcription of TNF-\u03b1 could be anticipated. In mammals, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 are known to have tissue-damaging potential, including inducing apoptosis (Dinarello, 1996; Eizirik, 2001; Hehlgans and M\u00e4nnel, 2002) and local damaging effects on the kidney (van de Kar et al., 1992; Jo et al., 2002; Malaponte et al., 2002) . In this study, these features, which were not previously reported in chickens, suggest that these cytokines may contribute to the pathological changes of renal disease in IB infection.",

However, the kinetics of viral load were not precisely in accord with those of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. In previous studies of influenza viruses, the differential hyper-induction of cytokines was not explained by differences in viral replication kinetics (Chan et al., 2005) , but the accumulation of double- stranded RNA within the H5N1-infected cell appears to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines in the absence of productive virus replication (Chan et al., 2012) . In case of SARS-CoV infection, the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was observed during in vivo studies (Wong et al., 2004) , but a similar finding was not observed in in vitro studies of productively in-fected cells (Tang et al., 2005a) . Instead, the induction of IL-6 was more significant in macrophages primed by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Tseng et al., 2005) . Thiel and Weber (2008) speculated that the pro-inflammatory response appears to be a secondary response of immune activation, not a direct response of cells against viral infection (Thiel and Weber, 2008) .
