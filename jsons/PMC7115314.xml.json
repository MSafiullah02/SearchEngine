The former is usually informed or trained, whereas the latter is generally uninformed or untrained. To appropriately manage diverse disasters in each nation, it is not only critical to work on technological developments, but it is also necessary to address the management process or mechanism at the human level. The basic principle of disaster management is to mitigate or lessen the impact of a disaster through an efficient mobilization of a program where all stakeholders participate, are fully recognized and are involved (Dastous et al., 2008, Jay et al., 2007, Kelley, 2005). Stakeholders are those who directly or indirectly work for the field of disaster management; in this paper, they are the government institutions, business entities, disaster management agencies, mass media, disaster management researchers, and the public, in general.",

Three disasters, with two occurring in Korea, have had major impacts on the nation in a number of ways. First, the March 2011 earthquake with tsunami in neighboring Fukushima, Japan has caused much anxiety and worry to Koreans. Second, the ferry Sewol sinking in the south coast of Korea on April 2015 was a dark day for the nation. Only 172 out of 476 people were rescued due to complicated factors that included the negligence of the ferry captain, the first responders' inadequate performance, the government failures, societal corruption, among others (Hwang, 2015). Third, the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) hit one hospital in Pyungtaek, Korea in May 2015. Because of poor ventilation in the hospital; the lack of information sharing among governments, hospitals, and residents; government's failure to immediately respond; the lack of citizens' disaster awareness; the lack of a national disaster management framework; and others, MERS has spread to many parts of Korea. As a result, 36 people have died of the disease and 186 people have been infected in Korea as of September 30, 2015 (Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS), 2015).",

Vertical relationship is supported fully among disaster management individuals and institutions whereas horizontal relationship is not considered or observed. Consequently, problems worsened as Korea failed to follow best practices of comprehensive emergency and disaster management. Above all, Korea has not acted with awareness that disaster can strike anywhere, may affect anyone and everyone, thus creating a gap in preparedness and response; an important philosophy of \u201cexpecting the unexpected\u201d is ignored (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2001). Until fundamental changes in focus, attitudes, and planning are made, Korea will continue to struggle to deal with the risks related to disasters.",

Because of threat rigidity, individuals or organizations may respond to a unique situation as though it were a familiar one (that is, underestimate or misunderstand the current situation) (Plotnick and Turoff, 2010).

Also, a comprehensive team to include lawyers, architects, emergency managers, and others can be assigned to inspect how each building or critical infrastructure has implemented the Firefight Act or the Basic Act on Emergency and Safety Management. Inclusion of these disparate, but relevant stakeholders will provide for a more robust plan. During disaster mitigation, local meteorologists can be included as they have the capability to quickly distribute information on climate change by utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as satellite photos and maps, mobile phones and applications, and geographical information system.

Professionals (e.g. physicians, trained members of public organizations such as the Red Cross) might volunteer to work with firefighters to search for and treat disaster victims in a timely manner during the phase of disaster response. During recovery, farmers could repair or improve the banks of rice ferries affected by flood or typhoon, while they manage debris around their farms. In addition, local school authorities could offer the use of their school buildings as emergency shelters after fires, earthquakes, or other incidents (Hiltz et al. 2010). Another benefit of opening disaster management to those not usually involved is the possibility of local governments expanding their collaboration with the military in their areas. Mutual aid agreements and utilization of heavy (military) equipment are areas where local governments and the military can be more flexible and create more timely and efficient response.",

As a result, fighting massive wild fires were aided and succeeded with the support of VOST (Denis et al. 2012). Korea and other nations may learn from these examples, not necessarily by pulling together thousands of advisors at one point, if not feasible and needed, but by recognizing and valuing multidisciplinary networking given the prevalence of today's technologies that can enable such collaboration in more effective ways than ever before (Banuls et al. 2013).",

Further, when thinking that the issues of disaster management are complicated and nonlinear ones, it is still difficult to describe who should be cooperating with whom in Korea. However, before, during, and after a disaster, emergency managers with the support of other stakeholders have to play a key role in arranging formal and informal meetings among diverse stakeholders, and thus, contribute to cooperative disaster management. In doing so, emergency managers have to use common language, while respecting each stakeholder's cultural sensitivity (Waugh and Streib, 2006: 134\u2013135).",

One example is that many infrastructures in the United States have been managed independently by various agencies without collaboration among them. Electrical utilities do not collaborate with agencies and experts in the fields of energy, medical services, police, or road networks. Joint planning has not taken place among those stakeholders and so the probability of human injury or death is increased in the event of a disaster, as joint response is not planned. Another example of potential problems that can occur without collaboration are these: if a center is supposed to direct ambulance distribution in the suburbs when there is an emergency, but residents do not call that center and call either the police or fire departments, time will be wasted rerouting the information to the managing center. This time can be critical for saving lives and properties.",

All stakeholders should be able to participate in disaster management in a way that is appropriate for their skills, expertise, and risks.

Several Korean professionals have been historically handling all important decision-making using exclusive management. They have a vested interest in maintaining the status-quo. Similar resistance towards exclusive management may be a problem in other countries as well. Solving this will require education and many discussions to develop support for this paradigm shift.
