The CH\u2010SDLY\u20102\u20102014 and CH\u2010SDLY\u20103\u20102014 strains were first identified from Linyi, Shandong Province in 2014, which were further verified to be subgenotype Gd. This is the first report of Gd subgenotype stains in Northern China. Considering the frequent animal trades between Linyi and South China, the current data indicated that the transportation of animals might be a source of PEDV transmission, and this can provide instructive information for the prevention strategy of exotic PEDV genotype invasion.",

Multiple alignment analysis showed that many amino acid mutations existed in the neutralizing epitopes of the PEDV S protein, which might be the most important reason for the frequent PEDV outbreaks in Shandong Province during 2012\u20132015.",
