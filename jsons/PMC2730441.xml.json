In this paper we assess the global governance of trade and health and focus on the organisations, institutional mechanisms, formal and informal rules, and decision-making processes that collectively manage trade and health issues. We discuss which institutions have the authority and capability to take action on trade and health matters, who participates in and who is excluded from making decisions, and who sets the agenda and defines policy. At present, there are challenges to strengthen the representation of health interests within international trade governance and to ensure trade issues are managed appropriately by health organisations. These deficits need to be addressed before a balanced and coordinated trade and health agenda can be achieved.",

As paper 1 described,4 trade governance is formalised and demanding, whereas global health governance has little structure, a greater diversity of contributors and perspectives, and weaker legal obligations. WHO has limited access to the WTO meetings at which trade issues that could directly affect health are discussed. Thus, WHO has observer status in the committees on sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade, and ad-hoc observer status in the TRIPS and trade in services councils. Observer status allows WHO to contribute to discussions but not be officially involved in making decisions. Since 2000, there has been political deadlock over the issue of observer status, and several WTO bodies have granted this status ad hoc to international organisations, such as WHO, in the interim. Importantly, there are few trade issues deemed to directly affect health, and thus representation by WHO is restricted. Moreover, the restricted sharing of information between health and trade communities, and the scarcity of substantive monitoring and assessment of trade policies from a public-health perspective, remain barriers to coordinated action between the WTO and WHO.",

Sufficient trade restrictions are needed to protect the life and health of people, animals, and plants. But, health provisions need to be appropiately applied so that abuse of the system cannot occur for protectionist reasons. Concerns have been raised about the degree to which action to protect health can be taken before there is complete scientific proof of a risk. Under environmental agreements, the precautionary principle supports action without full scientific evidence if there is risk of substantial adverse health outcomes. However, debate continues in the WTO about the legal status of the principle, the necessary level of scientific evidence, and the use of international standards and risk assessments.",

In many cases, these stricter rules have little flexibility to protect health\u2014eg, the USA and European countries have pushed for stricter intellectual property rights than those under the TRIPS agreement. Since 2001, every trade agreement signed or under negotiation by the USA has increased the terms and scope of intellectual property right protection of pharmaceuticals, including patent terms beyond the 20 years provided for under the WTO. These so-called TRIPS-plus standards are widely criticised for eroding the hard-fought flexibilities recognised by the Doha Declaration.11 Agreed in 2001, the Doha Declaration reaffirmed the flexibilities available to countries under the TRIPS Agreement to support public-health concerns, and clarified their rights to use compulsory licences to access generic drugs.",

Alongside the report was a proposed resolution to the World Health Assembly on a revised drugs strategy that called on member states to \u201censure that public health rather than commercial interests have primacy in pharmaceutical and health policies and to review their options under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to safeguard access to essential drugs.\u201d17 Both the report and resolution were strongly criticised by the pharmaceutical industry and US government,18 instigating a further year of consultation and heated debate.

The complexity of the issues and powerful vested interests involved, and the need for clear political leadership, has hindered the public-health community from having a meaningful role in issues for which trade and health intersect. These challenges must be overcome through a strategic and coordinated approach that would contribute not only to improved protection and promotion of health, but also to the creation of a more sustainable form of economic globalisation.",
