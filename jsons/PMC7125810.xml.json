Although Type B trichothecenes, notably deoxynivalenol (DON), are most commonly encountered (Pestka and Smolinski, 2005), the more highly toxic Type A trichothecenes are also sometimes detectable (Schothorst and van Egmond, 2004). Type A trichothecenes have nearly 10 to 100 times greater toxicity in animal and in vitro models than the Type B group with T-2 toxin being of most concern (Ueno, 1984). T-2 is considered to be the principal etiologic agent in outbreaks of fatal human alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) with clinical signs of this disease being gastrointestinal (GI) tract hemorrhage, bone marrow depletion, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and sepsis (Joffe, 1978). This etiologic linkage is supported by studies in experimental animals (Lutsky et al., 1978).",

In rodents, both i.p. and oral exposure to the toxin induces apoptosis of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, including bone marrow, Peyer's patches, spleen, and thymus (Ihara et al., 1997, Shinozuka et al., 1997a, Shinozuka et al., 1997b, Islam et al., 1998, Nagata et al., 2001). Experimental animals similarly treated with T-2 are more susceptible to systemic infections by Salmonella Typhimurium (Tai and Pestka, 1990, Ziprin and Elissalde, 1990, Kubena et al., 2001), Listeria monocytogenes (Ziprin and McMurray, 1988, Ziprin et al., 1987), Babesia microti (Corrier and Wagner, 1988), Mycobacterium (Kanai and Kondo, 1984, Ziprin and McMurray, 1988), and Herpes simplex virus (Friend et al., 1983). Although the intestine is a principal target in ATA, little is known of T-2\u2032s capacity to suppress the gut mucosal immune response. Assessment of potential xenobiotic modulation of mucosal immune function has lagged behind well-established methods for measuring systemic immunotoxicity (Kawabata et al., 1995, Bondy and Pestka, 2005). In one exception, Cuff et al. (1998) successfully used enteric reovirus (respiratory enteric orphan virus) to assess the suppressive effects of cyclophosphamide on gastrointestinal immune system suggesting that this virus is a valuable model for investigating mucosal immunotoxicity.",

In addition, reoviruses have been extremely useful models for studying many aspects of viral pathogenesis and host immunity (Tyler et al., 2001). Notably, reovirus exposure initiates a self-limited infection in mice in which the virus is cleared from gastrointestinal tract within 7 to 14 days after onset. Immune responses to enteric reovirus infection in murine gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) have been well-characterized relative to: (1) virus-specific intestinal IgA (London et al., 1987, Major and Cuff, 1996, Silvey et al., 2001), (2) serum IgG (Virgin et al., 1988, Major and Cuff, 1996), (3) cell-mediated immunity (London et al., 1987, Cuff et al., 1993), and (4) cytokine production (Fan et al., 1998, Mathers and Cuff, 2004).",

These effects correlated with suppressed Th1 and enhanced Th2 cytokine responses, respectively. The threshold for suppression by DON was 2 mg/kg bw. Given the greater reported toxicity of T-2 over DON (Ueno, 1984) and the inherent differences in the capacity of these two mycotoxins to modulate cytokine gene expression (Ouyang et al., 1995), exposure to even very low concentrations of T-2 might pose a significant hazard to human GI immune function. Here, we tested the hypothesis that T-2 interferes with the gut mucosal immune response to experimental enteric reovirus infection in the mouse. The results suggest that T-2 increased both the extent of GI tract reovirus infection and fecal shedding with as little as 50 \u03bcg/kg of the toxin being suppressive. Impaired gut resistance to reovirus by T-2 corresponded to suppressed immunoglobulin and IFN-\u03b3 responses.",

Reovirus also caused decreases in IL-2 (Fig. 8B) and IL-4 (Fig. 9A) mRNA which were not impacted by T-2. IL-6 mRNA was initially elevated by treatment with T-2 for 2 h without reovirus but did not differ from vehicle-treated controls during the course of reovirus infection (Fig. 9B).

Here, a single T-2 exposure was found to suppress the host response to reovirus as evidenced by the inability to clear the virus from intestine as well as by increased fecal shedding of the virus. Rosen et al. (1960) described an outbreak of T1 reovirus infection among children over a 9-week period. Fecal shedding of the virus occurred for at least 1 week in 54% of the children and lasted at least 2 weeks in an additional 21%. All children with detectable virus in their stools exhibited elevated antibody titers to the virus. Thus, the murine model employed in this study appears to be relevant to human infection from the perspectives of both gut infection kinetics and seroconversion.",

This dose is approximately equivalent to a daily consumption of 350 \u03bcg/kg T-2 in mouse diet. In relation, reported T-2 concentrations in European wheat, maize, barley, and oats have been reported to be as much as 250, 260, 310, and 530 \u03bcg/kg (Canady et al., 2001). The LOEL observed herein for the mouse reovirus model was consistent with findings of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) who identified the lowest observed effect level of 29 \u03bcg/kg bw per day based on changes in white and red blood cell counts identified in a 3-week dietary study in pigs (Canady et al., 2001). JECFA used this LOEL and a safety factor of 500 to derive a provisional maximal tolerable daily intake for T-2 of 60 ng/kg bw per day. It should be further noted that we utilized i.p. exposure in this study to minimize experimental variation. While T-2 distributes rapidly to lymphoid tissue regardless of exposure route (Canady et al., 2001), it will nevertheless be critical to understand how acute and chronic exposure by ingestion to low concentrations of T-2 might impact host resistance to reovirus.",

Reovirus selectively adheres to apical surfaces of M cells of the PP enabling transepithelial transport (Wolf et al., 1981, Helander et al., 2003). Secretory IgA antibodies provide a protective first line via entrapment of virus particles in mucus as well as blocking epithelial cell binding and entry (Phalipon et al., 2002). IgG can also provide protection against reovirus by neutralization and mobilization of factors that mediate clearance (Whitton and Oldstone, 2001). Our observation that T-2 markedly suppressed reovirus-induced Ig responses is of general importance because antibodies provide protective immunity against most viruses (Klasse and Sattentau, 2002).",

Suppression of one or more of these mechanisms could prolong reovirus replication and survival.

Exposure to T-2 has been previously shown to induce apoptotic cell death in PP, thymus, spleen, or bone marrow (Shinozuka et al., 1997a, Shinozuka et al., 1997b, Nagata et al., 2001). Notably, Islam et al. (1998) found that within 6 h after i.p. injection with T-2 doses as low as 0.87 mg/kg, marked DNA fragmentation is observed in the thymus. Using flow cytometry, these investigators further determined that when compared with vehicle controls, CD4+CD8+ double positive subsets were decreased significantly at 24, 48, and 72 h in thymuses of mice treated with 1.75 mg/kg T-2. Furthermore, a significant decrease in CD4+CD8\u2212 thymocytes was also observed at 72 h after T-2 exposure. Nagata et al. (2001) found similar effects in thymus mice orally exposed to T-2 and that these effects extended into the PP. Attenuation in CD4+CD8+ and CD4+CD8\u2212 cell could conceivably impact requisite T helper activity for mounting both IgA and IgG responses. Similarly, alterations in these populations might also contribute to decreased production of IFN-\u03b3. In support of this contention, we previously observed that in vivo DON exposure suppresses reovirus-induced IFN-\u03b3 secretion by CD4+ cells in PP cultures (Li et al., 2005). Additional analysis of the relationship among T-2 dose, differential leukocyte cell death, and suppressed reovirus responses is warranted.",

            "text": "T-2\u2032s effects on mucosal immune response to reovirus differed in several respects from that observed previously for DON (Li et al., 2005). Much lower doses of T-2 (0.05 to 1.75 mg/kg) than DON (2 to 25 mg/kg) impaired reovirus clearance. Furthermore, 10 days after treatment with T-2 at the highest dose, a large amount of residual virus remained in the intestine whereas it was completely cleared in mice at the highest DON dose. Thus, less efficient clearance after T-2 exposure might relate to suppression of the mucosal IgA response. While DON similarly impaired reovirus-induced IFN-\u03b3 and attenuated early mucosal and systemic IgA and IgG responses (1 to 5 days), it later potentiated reovirus-specific IgA in feces, serum, and fragment cultures during later stages of the infection (5 to 10 days). DON-exposed mice also exhibited markedly increased IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA expression in PP which was suggestive of a skewed Th2 response. All three of these cytokines promote proliferation and terminal differentiation of Ig-secreting cells as well as downregulate Th1 responses (Yamamoto et al., 1996, Diehl and Rincon, 2002, Conti et al., 2003, Mathers and Cuff, 2004). The lack of a similarly robust effect on Th 2 cytokines by T-2 suggests inherent differences between these two toxins (and perhaps Type A and Type B trichothecenes) in their capacity to upregulate cytokines during viral infection and might explain the lack of IgA enhancing effect.",

            "text": "Taken together, T-2 impaired clearance of the reovirus and increased its fecal shedding and these effects corresponded to suppression of both reovirus-induced Igs and IFN-\u03b3. Elevated viral load in intestinal tissue is likely to increase inflammation and discomfort to the host during the infection process. Additionally, increased fecal shedding could enhance virus dissemination among individuals. While reovirus was used here primarily as a model, its pathogenic mechanisms and resultant host immune responses are shared with many enteric and respiratory viruses (Nibert et al., 1996). It might be speculated that trichothecene exposure could enable more virulent viruses to establish infections and cause serious diseases. Intriguingly, reovirus T1/L has been found to evoke acute respiratory distress in young mice (Majeski et al., 2003a, Majeski et al., 2003b, London et al., 2002). A human reovirus isolated from a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient has been recently demonstrated to cause SARS-like symptoms in macaques and guinea pigs (He et al., 2005, Liang et al., 2005). Further insight is needed in reovirus and other viral models on the specific mechanisms by which T-2 and other trichothecenes interfere with cytokine- and Ig-regulated viral clearance and how these are impacted by dose, administration route, and duration of toxin exposure.",
