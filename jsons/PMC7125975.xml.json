MERS-CoV then spread to several neighboring countries, mainly Jordan and Qatar (see Fig. 2), and imported cases of the disease were reported throughout the world in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas [2]. By the 16th of October 2018, 2260 confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV had been documented in 27 countries by the World Health Organization (WHO) and were associated with 803 deaths [2]. The vast majority of the cases (73%) were reported in Saudi Arabia and only one widespread outbreak was observed outside of the Arabian peninsula in South Korea in 2015 [3] (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n). Due to the disease's high fatality rate (36%) [2], much effort has been put into understanding the origin and pathophysiology of this novel coronavirus to prevent it from becoming endemic in humans.",

They were held responsible for respiratory infections of moderate severity in humans. Despite these viruses being identified in several reports as causing lower respiratory tract infections, it was generally accepted that coronaviruses were of low pathogenicity until the emergence of SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) in 2002, a virus with a fatality rate estimated at 10%. The SARS outbreak that resulted in more than 8400 cases was finally contained two years later, in 2004, and the virus has not been detected again since [4]. There was renewed interest in coronavirus research following the SARS epidemic, and two novel endemic human coronaviruses were identified, NL63 and HKU1 respectively in 2004 and 2005, but could not be replicated in cell culture. Both of these new viruses were responsible for respiratory infections of moderate seriousness like the coronaviruses 229E and OC43. Great effort has been made to identify coronaviruses in animal populations, both before and after the SARS outbreak, in order to better understand and control the risk of animal-to-human transmission. This resulted in the discovery of coronaviruses in numerous animal species, with a few exceptions such as sheep and goats, fish and non-human primates [5].",

Very shortly afterwards, in September 2012, a second patient was admitted to hospital in the United Kingdom for severe respiratory infection related to a novel coronavirus following travel to the Middle East. The new virus was found to replicate in a tissue culture model and was rapidly isolated and identified for both cases [6], [7]. Retrospectively, other cases of the disease were found to have occurred before the 2 aforementioned cases: in April 2012, an outbreak at Zarqa hospital in Jordan affected the staff of the intensive care unit, with two fatal cases. The respiratory samples collected were later confirmed to be positive for MERS-CoV [8].",

MERS-CoV was very rapidly determined to be genotypically closely related to the betacoronavirus lineage C viruses identified in bats [9]. Based on these findings, and the major role of bats in the genetic diversity and spread of coronaviruses, much of the initial work aiming at finding the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV focused on bats. However, no conclusive evidence demonstrating that bats were the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV in the Arabian peninsula were found, despite the identification of closely related viruses in bats in Sub-Saharan Africa [10], far from the existing outbreaks. Very strong epidemiological links were identified between the human cases and camels and resulted in the isolation in camels of viruses that were directly related to MERS-CoV and that could replicate in cultured human cells [11]. The investigation of dromedary camel serum collections, some of which collected as early as 1983, demonstrated that the virus was already widespread (seropositivity rate > 80%) in the East African countries (Somalia, Sudan and Egypt). These countries export dromedary camels to Arabian countries, but also in Kenya, Nigeria, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Morocco [12], [13], [14]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 5 distinct coronavirus lineages in dromedary camels, including one recombinant lineage that led to the MERS-CoV epidemic in humans [15].",

The virions are then exported via the secretory pathway of the endoplasmic reticulum into the Golgi intermediate compartment and then into the extracellular environment. The M protein drives the packaging process by selecting and organizing the viral envelop components at the assembly sites and interacting with the nucleocapsid to allow budding [20].",

The importance of such cases is difficult to assess [10]. It is therefore difficult to determine whether these cases are due to or take part in human-to-human transmission. Several studies suggest that less than 50% of infected patients transmit the virus to individuals they come into contact with, even at the beginning of an outbreak [10]. The disease therefore seems to spread due to frequent animal-to-human transmission, from camels to humans, with limited subsequent human-to-human transmissions [21]. There are unfortunately exceptions to this observation and local outbreaks caused by human-to-human transmission have been observed on a regular basis, mostly in hospitals. To date, the most poignant example is the outbreak that occurred in South Korea in which the index case caused 185 secondary cases, among whom 30 were care providers, leading to 24 fatalities [3]. This outbreak was characterized by the key role of a few \u201csuper spreaders\u201d, delayed diagnosis, high doctor shopping behavior and the importance of confined spaces (waiting room, hospital room, ambulance). In this example, the resemblance with SARS-CoV's spreading mechanisms is striking, despite lower degrees of transmission to care providers for MERS-CoV [22]. These regular cases of imported-MERS, the most recent was reported in England in August 2018 [23], represent a real threat of local epidemics outside Saudi Arabia and special screening and isolation procedures need to be implemented in units likely to receive patients suspected of MERS-CoV infections.",

The PCR methods used are generally semi-quantitative and some studies suggest a correlation between the amount of virus detected and the severity of the symptoms [26]. Nevertheless, no consensus has been reached yet regarding a threshold level that could actually predicts clinical severity. Targeting the envelop gene upE is recommended with confirmatory testing for ORF 1A or 1B or the N gene. If results diverge, sequencing is sometimes required to obtain conclusive results [27]. Today, an increasing number of commercial tests are becoming available (Altona Diagnostics, Fast Track Diagnostics, Primerdesing Ltd.) some even with a time to results of less than 1 hour (BioFire\u2013bioM\u00e9rieux). Some of these tests are point-of-care, or can be performed in BSL3 facilities or a standard laboratory following sample neutralization in a BSL3 facility.

The death rate is highest among patients admitted to an ICU, ranging from 58% to 90% [49], [53]. In the only cohort study performed in Saudi Arabia, the fatality rate for MERS-CoV patients was of only 10% (8/80). However, the patients of this cohort were younger, had less symptoms, showed less radiological features and only 17% were admitted to an ICU [37]. The findings of the latter study diverge therefore with the situations observed in other hospitals, but are perhaps a better reflection of the infection profile in the general population in which younger subjects are less symptomatic and therefore less frequently admitted to hospital.",

Efficient vaccine development for host animals and humans could play a key role in tilting the balance from potentially-pandemic to MERS-CoV elimination.

In France, with the exception of the first 2 cases, no further cases have been detected. The current strategy is to isolate any suspicious cases as rapidly as possible to contain the infection and prevent local outbreaks as seen in South Korea.
