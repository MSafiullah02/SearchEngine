In fact, when confronted with a feverish child with respiratory symptoms, the single most important management question is whether or not to start antibiotics, which translates into how confident is the treating physician that the child in question does not have a bacterial lower respiratory tract infection.3, 4 Although epidemiological research has repeatedly pointed out that the large majority of lower respiratory infection in pediatric patients are caused by viruses,2 physicians often lack the tools to reliably discriminate between bacterial and viral etiology5, 6, 7 and a large percentage of children presenting with respiratory symptoms and fever are ultimately administered antibiotics.8 The absence of certainty regarding CAP etiology thus prompts an overtreatment with the consequence of increasing the emergence of bacterial resistance.",

The most important concern the fact that we did not collect samples in therapy\u2010naive patients, and this constitutes a veritable source of bias. This issue could have been avoided by collecting urine samples from all therapy\u2010naive children presenting to the emergency department with respiratory symptoms and a fever, and then analyzing only those obtained from children actually enrolled in the study. This will be worth bearing in mind for future metabolomic studies conducted in acute care settings. Another weakness of our study concerns the small number of patients in our two groups, which may limit the validity of our findings. On the other hand, our adoption of stringent enrollment criteria and a conservative diagnostic algorithm ensured that the two groups were etiologically pure, thus enhancing the specificity of our findings. A further potential limitation of this exploratory study lies in the lack of any external validation set against which to test our models, which could only be validated internally by means of a cross\u2010validation and stability selection to ensure the reliability of the findings emerging from the data collected. Though ours is only a preliminary study, the present findings seem to be a promising starting point for the conduction of larger, validated studies.",

Pneumococcal CAP prompts a stronger activation of the HPA axis, a marked organelle dysfunction, a relative increase in cGMP, and a significantly deranged amino acid metabolism. viral CAP, on the other hand, reduces prolidase activity and impairs macrophage activation. If confirmed by further, larger studies, these findings may have practice\u2010changing implications, possibly prompting the use of rapid point\u2010of\u2010care, urine\u2010based multi\u2010sticks for the diagnosis and management of pneumococcal CAP.",
