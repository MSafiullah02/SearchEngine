In cities like Singapore[10], Dubai[11], Milton Keynes[12], Southampton [12] , Amsterdam [13] , Barcelona[14] , Madrid[15] , Stockholm [16] , and in many cities of China [17] , the concept of smart cities have been implemented since long while more and more features are being added with passage of time [18] . The essence of a smart city also highlights challenges such as interoperability, security, and existence of non-standard data formats [19] . Various solutions have been proposed in literature to overcome these issues and even cities are now cooperating with each other to address such problems. For instance, seven US cities namely New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Seattle undertook the initiative for creating database for standardized open data applications [19] .",

Furthermore, the smart city concept can be applied to a smart community lab where citizens (and companies) are engaged and collaborate with the city to identify and solve problems, accelerate the innovation, and generate services created for and by the citizens [21] . The role of IoT is of great interest to smart cities. Gartner Inc [22] forecasts a 21% increase in IoT market for 2020 as compared to 2019 as there would be 5.8 billion IoT devices by end of 2020. On the other hand, smart cameras integrated with artificial intelligence techniques play a huge role in the surveillance systems. A BBC report estimates that for every 30 people on average, there exists one surveillance camera [23] . The United Nations partnerships platform for sustainable development [24] has developed a partnership with stakeholders for promoting exchange of best practices and knowledge transfer on sustainable urban development and the concept of smart city is no exception.",

Since the smart campus concept is mainly focused on infrastructure development, we divide the task into highest, medium, and low priority. We extend our resource allocation approach [1] to smart campuses domain and highlight corresponding solutions from the industry that can fully or partial assist in completing such projects. We understand this work bridges the gap between theoretical models and practical systems and has the potential to be implemented for creating a smart campus. The number of potential initiatives pertaining smart campus are countless, however it is entirely fine to begin with a few initiatives as per an institution's needs. For instance, for campuses located in dry regions with very little rain and high temperature, harvesting solar energy is more appealing than creating infrastructure for collecting and storing rainwater. For larger universities, it might be a priority to start with generic projects such as smart grid which could be a distinguished feature of any smart campus.",

Initially, cell phones were known as smart-phones and consequently any device that was controlled through smart phone was called as smart device. For instance, smart lights, smart toasters, smart washing machines and coffee maker, smart locks, smart shoes, heating, music, and so on. The concept of smart city can be implemented on various levels ranging from a single building to town to even a region [33] . In educational context, smart classrooms, smart stadiums, e-wallet, and smart parking are a few examples. In universities, today students bring several devices to campus, connecting to the network and generate huge data that can be used for offering improved services by the university management. A detailed discussion and definitions of smart grid technologies is prepared by The United States Department of Energy (DOE) [34] . A microgrid is considered a small-scale electrical system powered with renewable energy resources that can operate either in a connected or a disconnected mode to/from the main grid [30] .",

To sketch the smart campus and implement the plan, there is active participation and involvement needed from the govt, academia, industry, and users [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Authors in [36] noticed that the data is often siloed and isolated, and analysis and decision-making is normally based on a single dataset. An extensive research was made in [37] from the perspective of smart campuses where authors concluded that no standard understanding of a smart campus exists. Three patterns were identified in [38] based on the definition of smart campus i.e., (i) technology driven, (ii) based on smart city concepts, and (iii) business process driven initiatives. Many companies are offering solutions under smart cities umbrella such as GE, Intel, AT&T, Microsoft, Amazon, Honeywell, IBM, Google, Cisco, Dell, Ericsson, Qualcomm, Huawei, Verizon, CommScope Inc, and Schneider Electric etc [42] . A smart campus makes use of digital technologies to optimize the maintenance and utilization of the physical infrastructure to reduce overall energy consumptions.",

Many applications have been developed ranging from health-care services to goods delivery to surveillances [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . For instance, half of all-American adults have their images stored in one or more facial-recognition databases, while FBI has had access to 412 million facial images for searches purposes and Facebook can recognize faces with 98 percent accuracy [46] . Facial recognition systems are being used extensively in airports, security gates, mobile phones, classroom, and so forth. However, the facial recognition systems are not 100% accurate and largely depends factors such as camera angle, lighting, outfits, hairstyles, wearing or not wearing glasses etc.",

Ubiquitous computing, VPN, and IoT devices further enhanced the concept of smart campus. The technologies identified for smart campus include RFID, IoT, cloud computing, 3D visualization technology (augmented reality), sensor technology(motion, temperature, light, humidity), mobile technology (include NFC, QR code, GPS), and web service [50] . Various technologies exit for connecting IoT devices such as Bluetooth, LoRa, SigFox, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, 4GLTe , and so forth with different power consumption requirements and data rates. Some of the technologies provide higher data rates than others but consume more power while others may offer longer connectivity range. For instance, both WiFi and SigFox's power consumption is almost the same, hoverer SigFox offers better coverage i.e., connects devices within 3-5Km range through a single base-station [51] . Recently, authors in [52] provided a comprehensive study on communication technologies for the smart campus from communication perspectives and discussed the need for long-distance communication. For the data exchanges among various entities, the merits and demerits of blockchain were highlighted in [53] . In the context of smart campus, IoT devices are expected to be installed at building, stadiums, parks, streets, and so forth. In such applications the power consumption and range play critical role. These devices normally produce data in kilo bytes but the cumulative volume of data could be massive. The generic concept of data analytics is also applicable in the context of smart campus [19] and we integrate this work in our proposed model of smart campus.",

These services were categorized into three domains: Practical life, Academic life and Social life in [56] . University of Twente [57] developed a system to point out existing problems, submit maintenance requests and monitor the repair progresses. Microsoft has a similar solution that points out the location for the maintenance place after receiving the request. The system knows the locations of sensors/devices and user is not bothered to provide such details. Similarly, Saint Louis University has installed 2300 Echo Dots with their application \"SLU\" to provide information about the campus news and activities. Birmingham City University in [58] shared the experience of interwoven intelligence into campuses for improving business-processes, reducing energy consumptions, enhancing the occupant experience and reducing carbon emissions. The works [55] [56] [57] [58] have discussed smart campus in parts as the focus was on improving one or more aspects of smart campus but the need for establishing a generic model for smart campus still exists. A smart campus should be aligned with the concepts of smart city as a university campus in many ways is like a small-scale city.",

The fourth and fifth themes for the smart city was introduced in [56, [69] [70] as (iv) governance (administration), and (v) propagation (replicability, innovation).

We insert abstract diagram for the main themes and sub-themes and their relationship with potential smart project areas. Many initiatives can fall in more than one sub-theme, but we map such sub-themes to the most suitable ones. In figures 2-6, we further classify related areas to sub-themes for obtaining a unified view of smart campus. To avoid lengthy discussion on each subtheme, we only highlight the higher-level details of the figures and sketch them in such a way that relevant applications become apparent immediately and campuses may priorities them as per needs.

The bi-directional communication with IoT based solutions reflects the reporting of live data on the dashboard and hence assist the managers in running operations of the campus smoothly. In addition, the grid provides an insight to the energy usage pattern of the campus. The role of smart grid is so critical that some authors believe that smart grid is a smart campus [30] . It can be seen in Figure- 2 that the smart microgrid integrates power generation and delivery services. The campus is normally low voltage distribution system and offer more opportunities for energy savings. Majority of the devices in a campus are emended and capable of running at various speed as per the load. This situation allows the system to adopt to the load and lower the processors speed at run time when the workload is low and switched off/sleep the unused/unnecessary parts of the system. A closed loop control system facilitates such provisions through microgrid. In Figure-2 , the solid lines show the communication channels where the connection is strong while the dashed lines reflects that the sub-domain are overlapped and can contribute in many aspects. For instance, solar energy assist in making the system which is adaptive to climate changes. It is worth noting that IoT-enabled services constantly communicate with smart grid and exchange data such as power generated in a smart parking and its usage to power lights and other devices installed in the parking lot. Many of the smart infrastructure such as smart parking can harvest solar energy in daytime for equipment's installed in premises and can storage the additional energy to be used at night. Through smart metering systems, smart infrastructure remains in continuous communication with smart grid dashboard that collects such statistics and distribute energy accordingly. With smart campus, all these sub-domains also update the main grid about energy usage and by using artificial intelligence, we can forecast the future demands. With availability of enormous data, we can analyze the available data through deep learning for making more accurate predictions. Various products exist for minoring the carbon emissions. For instance, Everimpact [71] is used for smart monitoring and monetizing carbon emissions in cities. It can also be seen in Figure-2 that monitoring \"noise level\" does not explicitly benefits from the microgrid but implicitly provides statistics to the dashboard to measure the campus resilience to climate changes. The noise level on campus is being monitored and alerts should be issued when the noise level exceeds a threshold level i.e., noise in one classroom can impact the lecture in in another adjacent lecture room. In addition, it can be linked to campus in case of any potential mishap etc. For instance, the system should be able to issue immediate alert to inhabitants when smoke is detected, or any other abnormal situation is encountered. It is worth mentioning that smart microgrid directly facilitate the realization of smart campus from resource utilization, movement, energy savings, informed decision, improved services, and risk mitigations perspectives and a number of projects can be initiated under the umbrella of a smart campus. Majority of the sub-themes show in Figure-2 ",

With rapid innovations, even smart card is becoming obsolete and some campuses have started using services based on face recognition systems. The support for live audio translation in conference rooms/theaters is another example of smart services. Similarly, live data can be fed to the dashboard for making informed decisions. Counting people in-out not only helps in determining classrooms/theatres usages but can also help in emergency situations i.e., know the number of people inside a particular room in case of fire/earthquake etc. Social interactions and networking applications can be fed through appropriate data generated on campus. The main objective of a university campus is providing quality education and facilitating the teaching and learning, so it should be a priority for any campus to have smart and reliable solutions for enhancing teaching and learning in first place. The teaching and learning tools can by combined with physical infrastructure for offering improved services. For instance, attendance system can read data from the classroom smart cameras and mark a student present when recognized by the camera installed in the classroom. Similarity, reports can be generated for the teacher regarding student's engagement in the class and so forth.

The access to the dashboard can be limited to authorized user only and access levels can be defined for various level of management. Figure-4 provides an overview of the sub-themes and assists the management in decision making. Strategic plan of the university should be closely linked with community related services and their input need to be incorporated accordingly to set the future direction of the campus. The information shown in dashboard facilitates the campus management in decision making and devising mechanisms ensuing business continuity. The dashboard can be accessed by various stakeholders and permission/access to the data may be granted as per campus policies and standard operating procedures. While allowing access permissions, preserving user privacy is expected and the access should be granted on need to know basis. Proper logs need to be maintained accordingly for any potential audit and future reference. A clear view of resource usages can assist the campus management in scheduling resource allocation for improved utilization. In Figure-4 , many of the sub-themes might be of the interest to local government and stakeholders i.e., transparency. Similarly, reports will be sent to the parents about students' attendance and performance in class etc. The framework also connects the campus system with city government and public offices. IoT devices can be used to monitor stress level of campus inhabitants as well. The air quality can be monitored on campus and even predictive systems can be built to issue alert when abnormal situations are detected. Many universities have teaching hospitals and the use of IoT and actuators becomes an important aspect for monitoring health of patience and taking timely actions. For instance, with the recent spread of Covid-19, a smart application can help in tracking infected persons and thus reducing the disease spread.",

The same approach can be used to issue community alerts in case of diseases or epidemic and preemptive steps can be taken accordingly. Similarly, inventory management system can track any resource at any time using RFID tags. Library system can issues reminders to students for returning or extending the books borrowed from the library online. It is worth noting that such systems are already in place and are very successful, however, more analysis can be made by using machine learning techniques that learn from the data generated. Such data can help in creating proactive system for security managers and predictive system for the management to anticipate the future needs based on the trends as well as make recommendations. During large campus events, stadium/theatres gates can be closed/opened based on predictive analysis of the crowd flow. Similarly, using artificial intelligence, the traffic flow can be predicted in advance with ample time to divert traffic helping avoiding traffic congestions. The same model can be used at city level. Campus management may use such reports for developing contingency plans to ensure business continuity at various levels of the campus and associated entities. ",

Many universities are located in dispersed buildings and even have subcampuses at remote geographical location so the system must facilitate integration of such scenarios. As shown in Figure-5 , the model is expected to be scalable, reliable and replicable. As discussed in previous subsections, security of the data, infrastructure, and respecting the privacy J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of individuals is a challenge associated with smart technologies and smart campus is no exception. Care should be taken for creating and protecting digital credentials of students, faculty, staff, and so on. The intention of smart campus model is to propose a model that can easily integrated with city government with no/or minimum changes. Adequate security protocols and encryption mechanisms must be in place in a smart campus. Replication and scalability of the model should be done easily with no or minimum deployment costs. Since many of smart campus initiatives can be directly mimicked at city level, the ease of deployment at such level is a must for these projects under smart campus model. While replicating the campus model at other places such as town, city, or another campus, the privacy of users must be respected. Also, the cost of deployment of the smart initiatives should be simple to understand and calculate. Off course, the cost associated with hardware and software licensing will increase when replicated at a wider scale but an insight of potential cost involved would be needed for arranging finances to construct smart projects at city level. Similarly, the data generated should be reliable and the inputs from various sources should be verified before archiving and filtering the data. When deployed at critical infrastructure, redundant hardware is recommended to have a high confidence in the data and eventually overall smart campus system. ",

The sub-themes given in Figure-6 directly contribute to the campus prosperity. In addition to advancement of knowledge in various disciplines, a key performance indicator for the university reputation are the employability of its graduate, research publications, patents, innovation, and entrepreneurship. The smart campus sub-themes coordinate in a seamless fashion to achieve such indicators. Commercializing the ideas generated at campus need a clear business model. The focus of Figure-6 is on enabling digital economy starting from campus and can be scaled to larger spectrum. Since majority of smart campus and smart city projects are new and many investors fear that investments in such smart projects might not result in investment returns. A clear business models can attract investments for the smart campus projects. It is recommended to begin with projects that result in immediate investment returns. For instance, paid smart parking project can be given high priority. These initiatives can result in immediate returns and encourage the investors/governments for the other long terms projects. Sub-themes in Figure-6 are tightly coupled where hiring qualified faculty and students produce quality work and hence results in research publications, employability of students, ideas generation, innovation, commercialization, and eventually campus prosperity and visibility at national and international levels.

            "text": "To support the smart campus model established in previous section, we identify the key initiatives related to each of the campus themes. Table-2 provides a list of potential initiatives and service areas that contribute to the development of smart campus. We understand these projects can be prioritized as per stakeholders needs and the priority order provided in Table-2 is a flexible one, where \uf072 shows a project with no-contribution directly, while reflects contribution of an initiative against resource utilization, energy savings, informed decision, improved services, and risk mitigation. Table-2 is generated through brainstorming sessions, studying ranking systems, availability of relevant technologies to support the initiatives, smart cities literature, and expectations of the community from a university campus. The number and types of initiative are countless under smart campus umbrella. For a smart classroom, face recognition technology can be used for marking student's attendance and monitoring student's behavior. Similarly, noise level can be monitored in a classroom to avoid distracting lectures in progress in nearby classrooms. Even there exists an opportunity to enhance the washroom management system using latest technologies that can issue alert relevant when no activity is monitored when a person is inside for 30 minutes or so. The list for justifications of these initiatives can be a lengthy one but due to space limitations, we only highlight the major goals where these initiatives can contribute significantly. We align these initiatives with the main themes of smart campus. Justification for the corresponding initiatives are also provided. Each initiative can become an independent project with specific milestones, key performance indicators, and subprojects but for convenience we highlight the initiatives at higher level. In Table- 2, initiatives have been justified based on associated benefits against 5 domains (resource utilization, energy savings, informed decision, improved services, and risk mitigation), however, the mapping is flexible and may vary from institution to institution as the boundaries among them hardly exist. For example, the initiative \"people counting (in-out in classroom/building)\" directly contributes to the informed decision but at the same time, this initiative available energy resources and forecasting can help in reducing energy consumption by counting the number of people in the room/building. The same understand can be applied to other initiatives as well and hence virtually any initiative can contribute directly or indirectly to resource utilization, energy savings, informed decision, improved services, and risk mitigation. The potential cost, smartness and the available of hardware/software for deploying these initiatives are given in Table-3 , where various projects are proposed along with hardware/software requirements for supporting such initiatives. It is suggested that initiatives list can be prioritized based on the university needs and strategic objectives. It is more appropriate to start with initiatives where the infrastructure already exists instead of initiatives that needs to develop everything from scratch. In the former case, the additional cost would be due to the integration of smart technologies in the available infrastructure. There also exist situations where upgrading an existing infrastructure might need significant budge, time and resources. Considering such points, we understand prioritizing the initiatives for a smart campus is a subjective term and it totally depends on the institution's strategy and long terms goals. A generic priority order is shown in Table-3, where initiatives are divided into high, medium, and low priority. It is worth mentioning that we provide only generic model, where the priority order and cost are relative terms and depends on the location and resources of a campus. Similarly, in Table-3 , \uf072 is used for lacking, shows availability, while P stands for particle support of hardware/software by the industry at present. Partial intelligence means there exists some intelligence which is due to a set of hard coded rules and no learning is involved. With advancement of technology and with availability of data, devices will become more intelligent and will learn as time progresses. At present, majority of the devices only obey hard coded commands based on various conditions. These devices just follow a predefined set of instructions where intelligence is lacking in majority of smart devices and hence it is recommended to incorporate artificial intelligence-based solutions where possible that can exploit the creation of big data for making such devices more intelligent. There is also a dire need for using artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques for harvesting the data generated on university campus for improved services. In addition, the nature of the projects identified for the smart campus varies and to the best of our knowledge, no single hardware vendor at present can assist a smart campus in implementing all these projects. Considering these issue, compatibility of hardware should be evaluated before arranging hardware from a specific vendor for a project under smart campus umbrella to avoid any potentials issues that may arise during integrations of such initiatives at campus level. Not all current solutions are intelligent and hence we can divide the projects into non-smart, smart, and intelligent categories. Many of initiatives has the potential to be called \"intelligent\" by investing time and money in the existing smart solutions.",
