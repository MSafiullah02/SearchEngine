In this study, we report the results of a survey of codon usage bias of FMD virus (FMDV) representing all seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia 1, SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3). Correspondence analysis, a commonly used multivariate statistical approach, was carried out to analyze synonymous codon usage bias. The analysis showed that the overall extent of codon usage bias in FMDV is low. Furthermore, the good correlation between the frequency of G + C at the synonymous third position of sense codons (GC 3S ) content at silent sites of each sequence and codon usage bias suggested that mutation pressure rather than natural (translational) selection is the most important determinant of the codon bias observed. In addition, other factors, such as the lengths of open reading frame (ORF) and the hydrophobicity of genes also influence the codon usage variation among the genomes of FMDV in a minor way. The result of phylogenetic analyses based on the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values indicated a few obvious phylogenetic incongruities, which suggest that more FMDV genome diversity may exist in nature than is currently indicated.

However, in some prokaryotes with extremely high A + T or G + C contents [2] and human [5] , mutation bias is the major factor accounting for the variation in codon usage.

Up to now, it is unclear how FMDV serotypes might affect codon choice in FMD viruses and we used RSCU [42] , ENC [32] , COA [43, 44] and GC 3S , to measure the synonymous codon usage bias in order to minimize the effects of serotypes on codon bias, which have been successfully used to analyze the variation of codon usage among different viruses species [11, 13, 14, 22, 45, 46] . The analysis revealed that codon usage bias is low in most cases. [14, 22, 47] . In the case of human RNA viruses, the average ENC value also probably lies close to 45 since the distribution of values for [13] individual virus ranges uniformly from just under 38.5 to 58.3 [13] . One possible explanation about why FMDV had had a lower codon usage bias than other RNA viruses [13, 14, 22, 47] is that a low bias is advantageous to viruses that need to replicate efficiently in vertebrate cells, with potentially distinct codon preferences. A general mutational bias, which affects the whole genome would, certainly account for the majority of the codon usage variation. The genome base compositions affected the codon usage in Entamoeba histolytica genome [48] . Although the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome [49] had high GC contents, there was a little evidence that the genome composition shaped the codon usages in this genome. C. elegans showed a weak, but statistically significantly negative correlation between 'G + C' content and gene expression levels [50] . In human RNA viruses, H5N1 virus and SARS Coronavirus, mutation pressure rather than natural (translational) selection is the most important determinant of the codon bias. In this study, the general association between codon usage bias and base composition suggests that mutational pressure, rather than natural (translational) selection is supported by the highly significant correlation between GC 12 and GC 3S (r = 0.432, P \\ 0.05), and the result of ENC-plot (Fig. 2) . The fact that GC content varies in a similar way at all codon positions is usually assumed to be the result of mutational bias. A general mutational bias, which affects the whole genome would certainly account for the majority of the codon usage variation. A similar pattern of codon usage has been reported amongst some RNA viruses [13] . Since mutation rates in RNA viruses are much higher than those in DNA viruses [40] , it is understandable that mutation pressure is the determinant source of codon usage bias in the 40 FMDV strains included in this study. Therefore, mutational bias is the major factor responsible for the variation of synonymous codon usage among ORFs in these virus genomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 170, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 177, "end": 181, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 188, "end": 192, "text": "[43,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 193, "end": 196, "text": "44]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 419, "end": 423, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 424, "end": 427, "text": "13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 428, "end": 431, "text": "14,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 432, "end": 435, "text": "22,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 436, "end": 439, "text": "45,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 440, "end": 443, "text": "46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 512, "end": 516, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 517, "end": 520, "text": "22,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 521, "end": 524, "text": "47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 651, "end": 655, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 719, "end": 723, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 822, "end": 826, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 827, "end": 830, "text": "14,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 831, "end": 834, "text": "22,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 835, "end": 838, "text": "47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1206, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1259, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1512, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2322, "end": 2326, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2411, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1978, "end": 1986, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In Drosophila [51] genome, longer genes had lower codon usage bias.
