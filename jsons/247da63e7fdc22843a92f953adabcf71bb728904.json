Despite the high incidence and prevalence, there are knowledge gaps regarding the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and the optimal treatment of wheezing disorders in preschool children. There is substantial heterogeneity in the spectrum of symptom development, duration, frequency, severity, and response to treatment, as well as the pathophysiology and risk factors behind preschool wheezing [10] . This hinders general preventive efforts and may also result in inadequate treatment. A special consideration with preschool wheezing compared to that of later age-groups is that wheezing is predominantly triggered by viral infections, whereas later in childhood reasons such as allergens or exercise dominate. Approximately one half of all preschoolers wheeze at some point in time, and one third of this group will have asthma later in their life [11] .

As a possible mechanism linking early virus infections to childhood, asthma is supported by findings that variants at the 17q21 asthma locus (including ORMDL3) have been specifically associated with asthma in children who had had HRV wheezing illnesses early in life, connecting genetic susceptibility, HRV infection, and asthma development [4] . Additional evidence linking viral infections to asthma genetics relates to the gene encoding for the HRV receptor (C), CDHR3 on chromosome 7q22. CDHR3 was first identified in a GWAS on severe preschool asthma exacerbations in children [23] , and only later did experimental work lead to the identification of CDHR3 as the virus receptor [24] . Severe bronchiolitis, most often induced by viral infections, has also been evaluated using the GWAS approach.

Epigenetic changes may persist over a number of cell generations and can potentially be transmitted from parents to offspring. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate where and when different genes are active. DNA methylation is one of the regulatory mechanisms, and recent studies have found that genetics, aging, and environmental factors can influence the level of methylation globally or in specific genes, and early-life factors have been particularly studied. There are very strong associations between maternal smoking during pregnancy and DNA methylation changes at birth, as well as later during childhood [27] . Studies on 4-and 8-year-old children show that asthmatics have a lower degree of DNA methylation in certain immune cells than healthy controls, particularly in the eosinophils, which play a critical role in the asthmatic inflammation [28] . However, no association was seen between methylation in identified genes in cord blood and later asthma, which sug-gests that these particular changes were acquired during early childhood. Interestingly, the identified methylation marks were associated with transcriptomics patterns that suggest reduced activity of naive T cells and increased activity of effector and memory CD8 T cells and natural killer cells. This methylation-expression pattern in children with asthma may be due to different environmental factors such as air pollution, tobacco smoke exposure, or viral/bacterial infections, although definite mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

A phenotype encompasses observable traits or characteristics of a condition (e.g., allergic dermatitis or sensitization in allergic versus non-allergic asthma), whereas an endotype refers to an etiological (physiological or pathological) mechanism behind a disease. Persistent childhood wheezing is associated with atopy, and in turn, atopy is one of the strongest risk factors for later asthma and is related to an increased severity of asthma [32] . Atopic children, especially those with multiple sensitization, with asthma tend to be at higher treatment steps and have decreased lung function and more severe asthma in general [33] . In infants, sensitization to egg and milk typically occurs first, later to be followed by sensitization to other foods and airborne allergens. Depending on the geographical region and allergen load, different allergens are associated with asthma and multi-trigger (persistent) wheezing (e.g., mites, cockroaches, grass, or tree pollens) in different countries.

Also, a high blood eosinophil count may be a sign of an increased risk of persistent wheezing and atopy [35] . As such, early eosinophilia, allergic sensitization, and elevated total IgE levels indicate immune responses associated with persistent wheezing, asthma development, and asthma severity [36, 37] .

Tobacco smoke contains numerous harmful chemicals and toxins that may cause damage to developing lungs pre-or postnatally. Maternal smoking has been associated with deficient lung growth and wheezing, thus establishing a link between in utero exposure to tobacco smoke and a later phenotype of wheezing [56] . Secondhand tobacco smoke exposure early in life has been associated with reduced lung function in preschoolers, development of wheezing and asthma, a higher susceptibility to airway infections, and more severe manifestations of respiratory tract illnesses. Exposure to tobacco smoke is harmful due to both its inducing and exacerbating effect and is shown to be linked with more severe wheezing disorders in preschoolers [57] . Children exposed to tobacco smoke before birth and in infancy are also more susceptible to wheezing when exposed to other risk factors like traffic-related air pollutants; thus it seems that smoking may lead to damage and increased vulnerability in preschoolers' lungs [58] . E-cigarettes are electronic vessels that transport nicotine to the lungs in an act called vaping. Instead of combusting tobacco, nicotine and other components are transported to the lungs along with an aerosol from a special e-liquid containing a mixture of propylene glycol, glycerin, and flavorants. This is why e-cigarettes are thought to be less carcinogenic than the typical cigarette [59] . The long-term effects of e-cigarettes are unknown [60] . Furthermore, the effects of passive vaping on children and particularly infants and preschoolers with developing respiratory organs are unknown.

According to recent estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 90% of children worldwide breathe toxic air. Ambient air pollution consists of organic and inorganic liquid and solid particles suspended in air (particulate matter -PM), as well as different gases such as ozone (O 3 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and carbon monoxide (CO), and vapors such as volatile organic carbons (VOCs). The primary sources of ambient air pollutants are fuel combustion from motor vehicles, heat and power generation, industry and agriculture, as well as residential cooking and heating. In addition, natural sources (e.g., dust) also contribute significantly. Air pollutants may induce airway inflammation, increased airway responsiveness, and lung damage, and this is partly due to generation of free radicals and oxidative stress. Studies investigating exhaled nitric oxide support that inflammatory processes may partially account for the observed effects of air pollution exposure on childhood wheezing and asthma. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is an established biomarker of eosinophilic airway inflammation, and several studies show a relation between exposure and increased FeNO levels [67] . Other studies suggest a mixed inflammation response following exposure, including a predominant neutrophil airway inflammation. It is likely that the air pollutant source (traffic, combustion processes, biomass burning, etc.) in combination with host factors (genetics, preexisting conditions, co-exposures, etc.) will influence the type of individual response. Dietary intake has been suggested to modify the negative health effect of exposure. As an example, higher omega-3 intake was recently associated with diminished harmful effect of particle exposure on symptoms and asthma severity in children age 5-12 years, while higher omega-6 intake was associated with an amplified effect [68] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1349, "end": 1353, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2047, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Tobacco Smoke and nicotine exposure"}, {"text": "Young children are considered particularly vulnerable since they are more exposed to air pollutants compared to adults relative to their size, due to higher ventilation per minute, and an immature immune system that cannot optimally handle toxic agents.

The most prominent factor repeating in several models is allergen sensitization. Sensitization at preschool age may predict asthma in general at school age: allergy to cat, dog, mold, or pollen ( Fig. 2.4 ) was highly predictive of later asthma at preschool age both in a secondary healthcare and research setting [8] .

One alternative is that of measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath.
