            "text": "Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a member of the herpesviridae family, which infects pigs with high mortality. This virus disease causes serious reduction to the pig industry and leads to severe financial loss, which requires a better detection system for improving the virus surveillance (Pejsak and Truszczy\u0144ski, 2006). Traditionally, PRV detection is based on direct virus isolation (Pensaert and Kluge, 1989) or detection of antigens by an immunohistological method (Ducatelle et al., 1982). However, both methods are time-consuming, requiring at least 2\u20133 days. PCR has allowed detection of the virus rapidly, but requiring precise instruments and an elaborate method for detection the amplified product (Osorio, 1991, Balasch et al., 1998, Lee et al., 2007).",

Initial experiments were performed to optimize the assay conditions by using different concentration of MgSO4, dNTPs, primers, amplification temperature and reaction time. Among all factors analyzed, Mg2+ had the greatest affect on LAMP; it is possible that Mg2+ affects DNA polymerase activity and primer annealing (Saiki et al., 1998). The LAMP system developed in this study worked well during 60\u201365 \u00b0C, which would be useful for PRV detection in field practice when using a regular laboratory water bath. The results demonstrated that LAMP amplification products could be detected in 0.5 h, faster than PCR, so that diagnosis, including DNA extraction, amplification and product detection could be completed within 1 h after arrival of the samples. It could make the technique far more suitable for practice in the field.",

Alternatively, LAMP products could also be detected by adding intercalating dye Picogreen\u00ae. Positive amplification exhibited a green color while a negative reaction corresponded to an orange color (Dukes et al., 2006). The two visual inspection of LAMP product (Fig. 3(B and C)) are better detection methods as there is no need for gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. Furthermore, it was found that all samples which tested positive/negative by visual inspection were also positive/negative when analyzed by electrophoresis.

Six other viruses were used in the study to confirm the specificity of LAMP; the results showed no DNA amplification in all viruses used, which makes LAMP more attractive for PRV detection in the field. The high specificity of LAMP is most probably attributable to recognition of the target sequence by six independent sequences in the initial stage and by four independent sequences during the second reaction stage (Notomi et al., 2000). A good correlation was obtained between the LAMP and PCR results when using five clinical samples collected from suspect cases of pseudorabies, which demonstrated the value in practice of LAMP.
