Perhaps most immediately clinically accessible is airway driving pressure, defined as plateau pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Airway driving pressure is equivalent mathematically to\nV\nT\nscaled to the individual patient's respiratory system compliance (\nV\nT\n/\nC\nRS\n) (\nFig. 1\n). It was highly correlated with mortality independent of\nV\nT\nin a secondary analysis of multiple ARDS randomized trials.\n22\nAirway driving pressure also appears highly correlated with\nV\nT\nscaled to lung compliance (transpulmonary driving pressure = \nV\nT\n/\nC\nL\n).\n23\nTypical transpulmonary driving pressure is roughly 5 to 10 cm H\n2\nO with normal spontaneous breathing in healthy individuals,\n24\n25\nindicating the usual amount of global stress experienced across the lung in health. However, transpulmonary driving pressure can be substantially higher in patients with ARDS due to changes in compliance of the injured lung.\n21\n26\nTargeting healthy normal driving pressure during ARDS has intuitive appeal for this reason, but its role for enhancing lung protection remains to be tested directly in prospective clinical trials.\n",

First, the success of NIV for ARDS varies based on severity of hypoxemia.\n93\nThe rates of NIV failure double as severity of ARDS increases from mild to moderate or severe, increasing from 22.2 to 42.3 and 47.1%, respectively.\n91\nThis has led some to recommend that NIV in ARDS be restricted to patients with mild\u2013moderate severity, defined as P\na\nO\n2\n/FiO\n2\n\u2265150 mm Hg.\n93\nSecond, NIV failure is associated with worse outcomes,\n94\nwhich may reflect a higher severity of illness or possibly suggest that delays in intubation can be deleterious. Therefore, risk factors associated with NIV failure such as lack of improvement of the P\na\nO\n2\n/FiO\n2\nratio and shock\n84\n95\nshould be considered to optimize patient selection. In parallel, close observation for early signs of failure is needed to prevent delays in endotracheal intubation. A new bedside tool, the HACOR score (heart rate, acidosis, consciousness, oxygenation, and respiratory rate) has been developed and validated to predict NIV failure in hypoxemic patients with high accuracy at 1 hour of NIV to prevent intubation delays.\n96\nFinally, although there are data indicating possible harm with NIV in ARDS, it is important to consider the clinical context. A randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of standard oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and NIV in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure suggested increased mortality in the NIV group.\n97\nHowever, patients in the NIV group received NIV only for 8 hours a day for 2 days. Given that the physiological effects of NIV dissipate quickly after discontinuation, it is unclear if the NIV protocol mediated these findings as opposed to NIV per se.\n",

The astute clinician will carefully consider the patient's clinical features, physiological status, and response to ventilatory support to determine how to optimally ventilate the patient. The overarching goals of optimal ventilator management are to provide appropriate gas exchange while aiming to minimize dynamic stress and strain on the injured lung. This can be accomplished by minimizing tidal volume to the extent clinically permitted, increasing PEEP if improved mechanics and gas exchange suggest benefit, and implementing evidence-based strategies including neuromuscular blockade (discussed in the article by Syed et al on pp. 101\u2013113) and prone positioning (discussed in the article by Gattinoni et al on pp. 94\u2013100). The judicious use of NIV in appropriately selected candidates with mild/moderate ARDS may also be appropriate. HFOV and APRV may be considered as options for rescue therapy in deteriorating patients, although extracorporeal therapies (discussed in the article by Fan et al on pp. 114\u2013128) may take on more importance in this context.",

In the top panel, applying PEEP to the lung increases lung volume but because no additional alveoli are recruited, tidal ventilation is applied to the single alveolar unit and this unit experiences all of the dynamic strain. The amount of strain applied to the lung is determined by the ratio of tidal volume to end-expiratory lung volume (\nV\nT\n/EELV) at a given PEEP and FRC. In this theoretical (and simplified) representation, dynamic strain is approximately one-third in the nonrecruitable lung. In the bottom panel, applying PEEP to the lung increases lung volume and recruits an additional previously collapsed alveolus to participate in tidal ventilation. The same tidal volume is now distributed between two alveolar units, hence decreasing the dynamic strain experienced by each individual unit. This is the mechanism by which lung recruitment from PEEP is thought to decrease dynamic stress and strain. EELV, end-expiratory lung volume; FRC, functional residual capacity; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure.\n",
