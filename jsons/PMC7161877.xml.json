After 0.5 \u03bcL of various concentrations of DTPMPA was placed on each well of the 96\u2010well plate, a 25 \u03bcL solution of 400 nM helicase in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.6) was added to each well. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, ATP hydrolysis reaction was started by addition of another 25 \u03bcL solution containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 4 mM ATP, and 4 nM circular M13 ssDNA in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.6) to each well. The mixture was further reacted for 10 min at 37\u00b0C and the reaction was stopped by adding 200 \u03bcL of AM/MG reagent (0.034% MG, 1.05% AM, and 0.04% Tween 20 in 1 M HCl). The developed color was monitored by measuring at 620 nm and the released Pi was calculated using a standard curve. All experiments were repeated thrice and averaged.",

The base sequences of BHQ\u2010labeled and Fluorescein\u2010labeled DNAs were as follows: 5\u2032\u201020T25 BHQ (5\u2032\u2010T20GAGCGGATTACTATACTACATTAGA(BHQ)\u20103\u2032) and 3\u2032\u20100T25Flu (5\u2032\u2010(Fluorescein)TCTAATGTAGTATAGTAATCCGCTC\u20103\u2032). The dsDNA substrate of helicase was prepared by annealing 5\u2032\u201020T25BHQ and 3\u2032\u20100T25Flu. The 5\u2032\u201020 T25 BHQ was synthesized to have a 20\u2010base dT tail at the 5\u2032\u2010terminus to load the SARS\u2010CoV helicase. After 1 \u03bcL of various concentrations of DTPMPA was placed on each well of the 96\u2010well plate, a 80 \u03bcL solution of 150 nM helicase in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) was added to each well. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, dsDNA unwinding reaction was started by addition of 20 \u03bcL 5\u00d7 reaction solution (5 mM MgCl2, 45 mM ATP, 25 mM DTT, and 100 nM dsDNA substrate in 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]).

Then, 50 \u03bcL of MTT stock solution (2 mg/mL) was suplemented to each well to make a total reaction volume of 250 \u03bcL. The supernatant was removed after 2 h incubation and the formazan crystal in each well was dissolved in 150 \u03bcL dimethyl sulfoxide.
