            "text": "The Mass-type IBV vaccine is the most commonly used vaccine across the globe. There are several genotypes of Mass vaccines commercially available. Among them are Ma5, M41, H52 and H120 vaccines. Vaccine trials in our laboratory comparing two vaccine strains, Ma5 and M41, have shown that Ma5 achieves better protection against challenge than M41 (unpublished results). One hypothesis to partially explain this observation is that the Ma5 S1 protein has greater antigenicity than the M41 S1 protein. In order to test this, we calculated the Jameson-Wolf antigenicity indices (Jameson and Wolf, 1988) for the S1 spike protein at each amino acid position and compared numerical values of the antigenicity scores between the two Mass-type vaccine strains at each amino acid position (Fig. 4\n). The overall difference in antigenicity between Ma5 and other vaccine strains was also obtained by taking the absolute value of the difference in antigenicity score at each amino acid position and calculating the mean. We found that the overall antigenicity indices differed by only 0.0592, 0.0185, and 0.0593 between Ma5 and M41, H52, or H120, respectively. Most of the regions where we found the highest differences in antigenicity indices coincide with hypervariable regions in S1, as expected (Cavanagh et al., 1992) (Fig. 4). The differences in antigenicity indices between Ma5 and M41 were mapped onto their respective predicted tertiary structure (Fig. 5\n). Interestingly, we found that Ma5 had a higher antigenicity index in a region close to the residues critical for binding to host tissues (Fig. 5). There are a number of possible explanations for why the Ma5 vaccine achieves better protection than M41 against challenge including; replication efficiency of the vaccine, ability to induce neutralizing antibodies that closely match challenge strain epitopes, as well as the ability to induce antibodies near the receptor-binding region that presumably would block challenge virus attachment. Our data shows a higher antigenicity index close to the S1 receptor binding region of the Ma5 vaccine potentially leading to attachment blocking antibodies that could contribute to the better protection observed for the Ma5 vaccine.",

            "text": "Ark IBV is the most common serotype isolated in the United States (Jackwood et al., 2005, Nix et al., 2000). Currently, ArkDPI is the only commercially available vaccine against Ark IBV. However, ArkDPI has been shown to replicate poorly in birds (Roh et al., 2013) and to persist within a flock (Jackwood et al., 2009). Re-isolation of ArkDPI vaccine virus from vaccinated birds reveals that certain polymorphisms emerge, particularly in the S1 spike gene (Ammayappan et al., 2009, McKinley et al., 2008, Ndegwa et al., 2014, Nix et al., 2000, Roh et al., 2013, Toro et al., 2012). One of the most common polymorphisms observed in re-isolated ArkDPI is a tyrosine to histidine change at position 43 (Y43H). As mentioned above, amino acid position 43 is one of the residues that are critical for binding to host tissues. A histidine is conserved at position 43 (H43) in many other serotypes of IBV (Fig. 6A). However, position 43 has been substituted with a tyrosine in the reference sequence of the ArkDPI vaccine (GenBank accession ADP06471.2). Upon re-isolation of ArkDPI vaccine virus from chickens, S1 spike sequencing reveals that almost all re-isolated ArkDPI vaccine virus has H43. This suggests that H43 has some impact in the ability of IBV to infect chickens, likely by influencing the binding properties of S1 spike. To examine the impact of Y43H, we submitted the S1 spike of ArkDPI with Y43 or H43 to the I-TASSER server. The predicted tertiary structure revealed that position 43 is buried in the structure of ArkDPI S1 spike with Y43 or H43 (Fig. 6B and C). However, ArkDPI with H43 allowed for a conformational change to expose amino acid residues 38 and 63, which have been implicated in binding to host tracheal tissues. Our binding experiments on host tissues have shown that a tyrosine (Y) at position 43 allows S1 spike to bind strongly to chorioallantoic membrane in embryos, whereas a histidine (H) at the same position allows S1 spike to bind well on mature chicken trachea (Leyson et al., 2016). These findings provided an explanation for the emergence of the Y43H polymorphism in ArkDPI vaccine virus re-isolated from chickens.",
