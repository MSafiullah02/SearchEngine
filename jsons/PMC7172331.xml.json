            "text": "Influenza A, B, and C viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family of RNA viruses, circulate in humans, and cause respiratory illness every year (Wright et al., 2007). Influenza A viruses comprise a number of subtypes, whereas influenza B and C viruses are not divided into subtypes (Wright et al., 2007). Since the late 1980s, two genetically and antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B virus, namely, B/Victoria/2/87-like (B/Victoria lineage) and B/Yamagata/16/88-like (B/Yamagata lineage), have co-circulated (Kanegae et al., 1990, Rota et al., 1990). In Japan, the majority of circulating influenza B viruses during the 2010/2011 influenza season was of the B/Victoria lineage. During the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 seasons, both lineages co-circulated; the B/Victoria lineage was dominant in the 2011/2012 season, whereas the B/Yamagata lineage was dominant in the 2012/2013 season (http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/flunet/en/). The trivalent vaccines currently licensed for use in Japan include only one lineage of the influenza B virus; therefore, it is important to conduct surveillance to know which lineage is predominant at any one time to select a candidate virus for the generation of vaccines.",

The HI test is a conventional method to define the type, subtype, and lineage of clinical isolates; however, it is a time-consuming and complicated process that includes the isolation of viruses from clinical specimens and the preparation of immune sera. Recently, PCR-based assays for the rapid diagnosis of influenza viruses have become the gold standard and many real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays have been reported (Wang and Taubenberger, 2010). Compared with the HI test, rRT-PCR assays have the advantage of being able to be performed rapidly, sensitively, and specifically using purified RNA from clinical specimens without requiring a viral isolation step.",

Fluorescent signals were collected during the annealing and extension steps, and the amplification data were analyzed using Light Cycler\u00ae 480 SW1.5 software according to the manufacturer's instructions. The rRT-PCR assays for typing influenza A and B viruses and subtyping H1pdm and H3 (Nakauchi et al., 2011b) were also performed for the diagnosis of the clinical specimens.",

The standard curves were generated using the average Cp values obtained from the assay performed with six replicates. The correlation coefficients and slope of the standard curves are represented in the graph. The standard curves were made based on the B/NS rRT-PCR assay performed using a synthesized NS gene segment of B/Florida/4/2006 (diamonds) and the B/Vic and B/Yam rRT-PCR assays performed using a synthesized HA gene segment of B/Brisbane/60/2008 (filled circles) and B/Massachusetts/02/2012 (open circles), respectively.",
