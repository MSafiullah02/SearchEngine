Highly pathogenic mononegavirale members such as the Nipah virus interacts with IMP\u03b14 (KPNA3) and IMP\u03b13 (KPNA4) for its viral protein nuclear localization to inhibit the activation of the IRF3-responsive promoter, 17 while Ebolavirus interacts with IMP\u03b15 (KPNA1), IMP\u03b16 (KPNA5) and IMP\u03b17 (KPNA6) to disrupt their interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 for nuclear import, inhibiting IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) production. 18, 19 Similarly, positive-sense RNA poliovirus and rhinovirus are shown to disrupt nucleocytoplasmic trafficking by proteolytic cleavage of specific Nups that inhibit host antiviral defense pathways.

As such, IMP\u03b21 contains 19 tandem HEAT sequence repeats, which binds cargo-IMP-\u03b1 complex through HEAT repeats 7-19, 31 RAN via HEAT repeats 1-3, 6, 7, 13 and 14 32, 33 and FG-Nups via HEAT repeats 5 and 6 for the translocation of cargo through NPCs. 34 Many proteins are also recognized directly by specific NTRs of the IMP-\u03b2 family (TNPO1, TNPO2, TNPO3/IPO12) without the intervention of IMP-\u03b1, and often contain a proline-tyrosine NLS (PY-NLS) motif. 27 Conversely, EXP-1/CRM1, through interaction with NES, and others such as EXP-2/CSE1L, -5, -6, -7, -t and RanBP17 facilitate protein export to the cytoplasm. Finally, the direction of cargo transport is mainly controlled by GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran (RAN) across the nuclear envelope. RAN in the nucleus dissembles NTR-cargo import complexes, releasing the cargo and allowing NTRs to translocate back to the cytoplasm, 35 whereas RAN bound EXP-cargo complexes in the cytoplasm are dissembled when RANGTP is hydrolyzed to RANGDP by GTPase-activating protein 1 -(RANGAP1) and RAN binding proteins. 36 In this study, HCV-host interactors previously identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) analysis are investigated for their effect on IFNB1 transcription in response to SeV infection by gene silencing. Factors with the greatest inhibitory effects are functionally associated with protein transport by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Notably, all candidates were determined to interact with NS3/4A protein, which is well-known for its role in evading the antiviral response. The effects of silencing proteins associated to nucleocytoplasmic trafficking were investigated for IFNB1 production through the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65 TFs upon viral infection. By a microscopy-based high-content screening combined to gene silencing, we identified several proteins that reduce the number of IRF3-and p65-positive nuclei within a 10 hours period post-infection decreasing IFNB1 production. We also identified proteins that delayed, increased or had a differential effect on IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation, and similarly reduced IFNB1 production upon gene knockdown. Depletion of the main import carrier IMP\u03b21 showed the most significant decrease in IFIT1 (ISG56) expression, which correlated with rapid increase of viral protein levels and virus-mediated apoptosis. We found that expression of NS3/4A triggers the cleavage of IMP\u03b21 to evade IFNB1 production in This HCV interactome study led to the identification of selective host interactors to one of the viral proteins Core, NS2, NS3/4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. The biological significance of these host proteins with an RNAi silencing screen further revealed that majority of these interactors are not affecting virus replication. However, HCV replication is often monitored in the RIG-I deficient Huh7.5 cell line such that one cannot assess if the viral-host protein interactions benefit the virus through subversion of the innate immune response resulting in increased viral replication and pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we silenced 132 selective HCV-host interactors ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information) using~5 independent short hairpin RNA (shRNA)expressing lentiviruses, and measured the induction of IFNB1 promoterdriven firefly luciferase upon SeV infection of A549 human lung carcinoma cells and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK)293T cells. We previously showed that SeV infection predominantly activates the RLR pathway in these cells, leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 TFs, induction of IFNB1 mRNA and secretion of IFN-\u03b2 cytokine. 37 In parallel, cells harboring a luciferase gene driven by the nonimmune endogenous elongation factor 1 alpha (EEF1A1) promoter were used to assess the effects of shRNAs on basal transcription. The gene silencing screens revealed 35 modulators of antiviral response in HEK293T cells and 29 modulators in A549 cells (Figure 1 ).

In addition, the need for fast activation upon viral infection must not require a process that is dependent on IMP\u03b13 as its knockdown has no impact on IFNB1 production. Our data also demonstrate that IMP\u03b21 is one of the main import receptor for IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 import upon viral infection (Figure 7) , as previously reported for NF-\u03baB p65. 46 However, other carriers have been identified for NF-\u03baB p65 import including IPO8, 46 which transports this factor in a NLS-independent fashion after stimulation TNF-\u03b1. In our study, knockdown of IPO8 resulted in a decrease IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation during the entire time course of infection and reduction of IFNB1 production ( Figures 4A and S4) , suggesting that an NLS-independent import process for IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 may take place during viral infection. We also identified the import carriers TNPO1 and IPO7 as their knockdown reduces nuclear translocation of both TFs (Figures 4A,B, S4, S5) , which supports the finding of a PY-NLS that is recognized by TNPO1. 52 Finally, knockdown of IPO4, TNPO2 and IPO12 affect irregularly or at later time NF-\u03baB p65 and IRF3 nuclear translocation (Figures 4, S4 and S5) , suggesting a weak if any contribution to these processes in a virus-dependent manner.

Nevertheless, EXP1 was previously shown to bind IRF3 NES, and the use of EXP1 inhibitor leptomycin B further demonstrated an accumulation of IRF3 in the nucleus. 45 Our results support EXP1 as the main carrier for IRF3 export causing nuclear accumulation of IRF3 during the early phase of the infection upon it knockdown (Figures 4 and   S6 ). This is further supported by RANBP3 knockdown, an EXP1 cofactor for protein export, 53,54 which increases nuclear translocation of IRF3 at 8 hours of SeV infection but surprisingly without affecting IFNB1 production ( Figure S6 ). Among all EXP family members, only EXP1 systematically exported NF-\u03baB p65 at all time confirming a previous study. 46 Despite the increased nuclear levels of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65, EXP1 knockdown decreased IFNB1 promoter activity following SeV infection ( Figure S6 ). This may be explained by an effect on cell survival and/or by the fact that residual NF-\u03baB p65 can reassociate with I\u03baB\u03b1 to reduce it transcriptional activity when sequestered in the nucleus. 55, 56 Interestingly, EXP2 knockdown causes a dramatic decrease of nuclear IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 during the entirety of the SeV infection time course leading to a significant reduction of IFNB1 and cell fitness ( Figure S6 ). This is possibly due to its major role for the export of IMP-\u03b1 adaptors to the cytoplasm as a recycling mechanism of import complexes. 57 We also identified NXF1 and NXT1 proteins that significantly reduced nuclear import of IRF3/NF-\u03baB p65 and IFNB1 production ( Figures 4D and S7) . These proteins are exploited by several viruses to promote viral mRNA export and inhibit host mRNA trafficking. 20 Further studies will be required to demonstrate if the diminished amounts of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 proteins translated and able to enter the nucleus are due to the reduced export of their mRNAs to prevent antiviral response. The silencing of RAN, NUTF2 and RCC1 equally affected IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation and IFNB1 production, while only RAN silencing affected cells survival (Figures 4E and S8 ). As NUTF2 is responsible for recycling RANGDP back to the nucleus and RCC1 for exchanging the GDP to GTP, these data confirm that the lack of RANGDP or RANGTP in the nucleus affect nuclear transport with IRF3 being less affected than NF-\u03baB p65. Nevertheless, the silencing of RAN components NUTF2 and RCC1 decreasing IFNB1 production without affecting cell fitness ( Figure S8 ) further corroborate that this process is critical for ensuring proper nucleocytoplasmic transport required for antiviral response.

Briefly, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking genes are silenced in A549 cells cultured in transparent 96-well plates by lentiviruses encoding shRNA for 4 days to allow for the efficient knockdown of the targeted gene. Five independent lentiviruses per gene (1 per well) are used at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. A control shRNA expressing a non-target sequence (shRNA NT) is included in each 96-well plate. Knockdown cells are then infected with SeV for 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 hours, fixed, and permeabilized prior to nuclear labeling with Hoechst and IRF3 or NF-\u03baB p65 immunostaining. Images are captured in 9 pre-determined fields per well, under an Operetta High Content Screening (HCS) microscope. Images are then processed using the Harmony software to delimitate the nuclear region and to measure the fluorescence intensity of IRF3 or NF-\u03baB p65 within the nucleus. For each 96-well plate, a fluorescence cut-off is set to allow the automated discrimination of cells with (green) or without (red) IRF3 or NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear staining (Figure 2A). This information allowed us to calculate the percentage of cells with IRF3 or NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear staining, and to evaluate the effect of each shRNA on SeV infection-induced nuclear translocation of TFs. A representative time-course experiment performed with control shRNA NT-transduced cells showed the nuclear translocation of both TFs over a 10-hour SeV infection (", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "infected with SeV for 8 and 24 hours (Figure 6). Notably, IMP\u03b21 knockdown led to a drastic and rapid increase in SeV protein levels when compared with those of control cells transduced with shRNA NT. This is further accompanied by nearly a complete inhibition of the antiviral response at 8 hours as measured by IFIT1 (ISG56) protein induction. Similar data are observed with HEK293T (Figure S13).These results suggest that IMP\u03b21 is targeted by HCV NS3/4A protein to disrupt IFNB1 production, reminiscent to a similar mechanism employed by HCV to prevent the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and type I IFN signaling. 1 Using 3 independent shRNAs specific to IMP\u03b21, we confirmed that its depletion significantly hindered IFNB1 induction of SeV-infected cells correlating with the reduced nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 when compared with the shRNA NT (Figure 7A). Indeed, we showed that IMP\u03b21 knockdown led to a strong decrease in IRF3 nuclear translocation at 3 and 5 hours post-infection, before returning to normal levels at 8 and 10 hours postinfection. A similar pattern was observed for NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation, although with a less drastic decrease at 3 and 5 hours post-infection, and culminated with increased nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 staining at 8 and 10 hours post-infection compared with that in presence of shRNA NT. In addition, we used caspase-mediated poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) cleavage-that generates 89-and 24-kDa fragments-to assess virus-mediated apoptosis. Correspondingly, we observed that the rapid increase in SeV protein levels of IMP\u03b21-depleted A549 cells was accompanied by an accelerated induction of apoptosis that started 1 hour post-infection instead of 3 hours post-infection in control shRNA NT expressing cells (Figure 7B). Because all proteins associated with nuclear transport interact with NS3/4A, we examined its interaction with the critically important IMP\u03b21 more carefully. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were run to validate the NS3/4A-IMP\u03b21 interaction (Figure 7C). BILN 2061, a potent NS3/4A-specific protease inhibitor (PI), was used as an additional control. 48 Interestingly, aside from the expected interaction, western blot analysis revealed the recognition of an additional IMP\u03b21 fragment only with protease active NS3/4A and in the absence of BILN 2061 PI. An amino acid sequence within IMP\u03b21 Cterminus was found to be concordant with the cleavage consensus of NS3/4A protease. The resulting sizes of predicted fragments agreed with the molecular weights of bands observed in western blot analysis: 97 kDa for full-length IMP\u03b21 vs 89 kDa for cleaved IMP\u03b21 (Figure 7C). The cleavage at this site could rationalize the NS3/4A interaction-mediated prevention of IRF3/NF-\u03baB p65 as well as STAT1 nuclear translocation. 1,49 To assess a role of NS3/4A-mediated cleavage of IMP\u03b21 in subverting IRF3/NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation, we investigated the IFNB1 promoterdriven luciferase upon SeV infection in cells that expressed a NS3/4A protease cleavage-resistant MAVS variant, mutated at Cys-508 for an arginine (MAVS C508R ), 50 and MAVS wild-type (WT) as control. We engineered MAVS KO cells using GeneArt gRNA, Platinum Cas9 nuclease and Lipofectamine CRISPRMAX Cas9 Transfection Reagent from Thermo Fisher Scientific 51 to reduce competition between endogenous and ectopically expressed MAVS proteins. We first demonstrated that expression of NS3/4A completely blocks SeV-mediated IFNB1 production of MAVS KO cells reconstituted with the WT protein, which is completely restored by BILN 2061 PI (Figure 8A). More importantly, NS3/4A is still able to inhibit IFNB1 of SeV-infected cells that are reconstituted with the MAVS C508R variant, blocking up to 70% of the IFNB1-driven luciferase induced by control cells in the absence of active NS3/4A protease. Furthermore, BILN2061 PI restores IFNB1 and IFIT1 induction, correlating with the disappearance of IMP\u03b21cleavage (Figure 8A,B). To confirm this, we constructed an IMP\u03b21 variant that is mutated at multiple residues within the cleavage consensus of NS3/4A protease (D812A, C817S and A818G), including Cys-817 as the major determinant to produce a cleavage resistant IMP\u03b21 (IMP\u03b21 CR ). The expression of IMP\u03b21 CR but not of IMP\u03b21 WT completely restores IFNB1 production of MAVS C508R -reconstituted cells expressing NS3/4A protease upon infection, similar to the treatment with BILN 2061 PI (Figure 8C).

To test this hypothesis, we used a SeV model of infection and RIG-I competent cells, and found that silencing expression of 53 of 132 interactors had a significant effect on IFNB1 production (Figure 1). Moreover, depletion of 12 of these 53 interactors was previously reported to reduce HCV replication in RLR-deficient Huh7.5 cells (Figure S2), providing strong evidence that viruses through host interactions can hijack cellular processes involved in the modulation of innate immune response and additionally contributing to the virus replication life cycle giving a dual growth advantage. The GO term analysis of the 53 interactors revealed enrichment in nuclear protein import and export processes (Table 1). Interestingly, the interactors associated to the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of proteins (IMP\u03b21, TNPO1, EXP1, EXP2 and RAN) exhibit 2 main characteristics-a potential to interact with NS3/4A (Figure S1), and a functional relevance to SeV-induced IFNB1 promoter inhibition (Figure 1). Correspondingly, IMP\u03b21, TNPO1 and RAN decrease HCV replication upon their depletion in the Huh7.5 cell line, 1 confirming the targeting of key players of the nuclear transport cell process to concurrently evade innate immune response and to promote virus replication. To gain mechanistic insight of the modulation of IFNB1 antiviral response by these interactors, we developed a microscopy-based high-content screening assay that directly evaluates the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 over a 10-hour viral infection time course. The assay was validated biochemically using nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation (Figure 2D), and supported by the kinetics of phosphorylation of IRF3 and of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor NFKBIA upon virus-mediated induction of antiviral response.

Moreover, knockdown of the main export carrier EXP1 increased nuclear translocation of TFs, in contrast to EXP2 (CSE1L), with transient and sustained kinetics for IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65, respectively (Figures 4C and S6). Interestingly, IMP\u03b16 and RANBP3 knockdown both caused a delay in IRF3 translocation and a transient decrease in NF-\u03baB p65, suggesting that RANBP3 utilizes IMP\u03b16 as an adaptor (Figures 4C and S6).Figure 5 displayed a decrease of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation for the knockdown of most Nups that are categorized by their localization within the NPC, with the exception of NUPL2 (Figures 5A and S9) and NUP43 (Figures 5Band S10). Specifically, NUPL2 knockdown cells increased IRF3 translocation at very early stages of infection, and correlated with EXP1 knockdown effect, which is expected as NUPL2 promotes EXP1 function.47 Furthermore, NUP43 knockdown cells showed a similar nuclear translocation phenotype for both factors, as seen with IMP\u03b16 and RANBP3 knockdown, suggesting that NUP43 plays a functionally significant role in RANBP3-IMP\u03b16 import complex through the NPC.In parallel to the microscopy-based assay, the effect of silencing each protein was also determined on IFNB1 promoter activity following SeV infection.
