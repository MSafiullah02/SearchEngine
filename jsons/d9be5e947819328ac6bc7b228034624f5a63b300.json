Here we use state-of-the-art deep neural networks over an institution-wide machine intelligence platform for the augmented curation of 15.8 million clinical notes from 30,494 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR diagnostic testing. By contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=635) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg, n=29,859) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia/dysgeusia (37.4-fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2.6-fold), diarrhea (2.2-fold), fever/chills (2.1-fold), respiratory difficulty (1.9-fold), and cough (1.8-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 3.2-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19 (4-7 days prior to typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the realtime synthesis of institutional knowledge captured in EHRs. The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling up curation throughput, with minimal need for retraining underlying neural networks, thus promising EHR-powered early diagnosis for a broad spectrum of diseases.",

Examining the other 325 possible pairwise symptom combinations, excluding the altered sense of smell of taste, reveals other interesting combinatorial signals. The combination of cough and diarrhea is noted to be significant in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients during the week preceding PCR testing; i.e. cough and diarrhea co-occur in 12.4% of COVIDpos patients and in 3.9% of COVIDneg patients, indicating a 3.2-fold amplification of this specific symptom combination (BH corrected p-value = 4.0E-17, Table S1 ).",

Altered sense of taste or smell, cough, diarrhea, fever/chills, and respiratory difficulty were found to be significant discriminators of COVIDpos from COVIDneg patients between 4 to 7 days prior to PCR testing. During that time period, cough is amplified in the COVIDpos patient cohort over the COVIDneg patient cohort with an amplification of 3.9-fold (day -7, p-value = 1.4E-09), 4.33fold (day -6, p-value = 1.8E-12), 2.6-fold (day -5, p-value = 3.9E-04), and 2.2-fold (day -4, p-value = 8.4E-03). The intriguing diminishing odds of cough as a symptom from 7 to 4 days preceding the PCR testing date, suggests this may be a notable temporal pattern. Likewise, diarrhea is amplified in the COVIDpos patient cohort over the COVIDneg patient cohort with an amplification of 3.2-fold (day -7, p-value = 4.1E-04), 3.0-fold (day -6, p-value = 6.3E-04), 1.9-fold (day -5, p-value = 1.0E-01), and 1.2-fold (day -4, p-value = 6.8E-01). Similarly, fever/chills is also enriched in the COVIDpos patient cohort over the COVIDneg patient cohort with 5.1-fold (day -7, p-value = 1.3E-12), 5.1-fold (day -6, p-value = 7.3E-15), 3.1-fold (day -5, pvalue = 2.2E-05), and 2.6-fold (day -4, p-value = 5.7E-04) amplifications. Respiratory difficulty is likewise enriched in day -7 (3.7-fold, p-value = 4E-07), day -6 (3.8-fold, p-value = 2.9E-08), and day -5 (2.7-fold, pvalue = 4.4E-04) among the COVIDpos patient cohort. Temporally subsequent to the enriched odds of diarrhea, cough, fever/chills, and respiratory difficulty, we find that change in appetite/intake is amplified in the COVIDpos cohort over the COVIDneg cohort on day -4 (6.3-fold, p-value = 2.2E-08), day -3 (6.0-fold, pvalue = 5.7E-08), and day -2 (4.6-fold, p-value = 5.9E-06).

Given recent studies implicating the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle 10 , we scouted for human cells that co-express both genes. This co-expression analysis revealed that specific cell types from the small intestine/colon, nasal cavity, respiratory system, pancreas, urinary tract, and gallbladder co-express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 ( Figure  1, Figure S1 ). Notably, multiple small intestine cell types co-express the two genes. These cell types include enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, stem cells, goblet cells, and Paneth cells. In the pancreas, the cell types included ductal cells and acinar cells. The kidney cells co-expressing TMPRSS2 and ACE2 include proximal tubular cells, pelvic epithelial cells and type A intercalated cells. Co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 is also observed in the epithelial cells of the olfactory nasal cavity and the respiratory tract as well as in type II pneumocytes (albeit at comparatively lower level). While the identified tissues showing co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the gastro-intestinal, respiratory, and sensory systems correlate with the clinical  phenotypes of early COVID-19 infection as described above, these insights are conceivably from  normal/healthy tissues. This highlight the need for meticulous bio-banking of COVID-19 patient-derived  biospecimen and their characterization via single cell RNA-seq and other molecular technologies. Primary prevention is the most effective method to minimize spread of contagious infectious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure S2 ). In addition to population-based strategies such as social distancing, there are significant ongoing efforts to develop a prophylactic solution ( Table S2) . As the immunodominant humoral immune response in patients is directed against the SARS-CoV2 spike protein, many vaccines under investigation target this viral protein. It remains to be determined whether anti-spike protein antibodies induced by natural infection or by vaccines induce neutralizing antibody responses. Chloroquine and its analogues have been shown to inhibit virus replication in-vitro 28 . Whether Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine have meaningful effects of SARS-CoV2 replication in patients remains to be understood, and are the subject of clinical trials, both as post-exposure prophylaxis and as treatment (Table  S2) . Hydroxychloroquine was approved by FDA for emergency use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are not eligible for clinical trials on April 7, 2020 based on limited clinical data, but concerns have been raised about toxicity and risk of sudden death 29 .",

Some of the earliest phases of intervention attempt to inhibit the entry/replication of SARS-CoV-2 by modulating critical host targets (e.g. renin angiotensin aldosterone system/RAAS inhibitors, ACE2 analogs, serine protease inhibitors) or directly inhibiting the function of viral proteins (e.g. viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, convalescent plasma, synthetic immunoglobulins) (Box 1, Table  S3 ). In patients with more advanced stages of disease progression, who suffer from respiratory abnormalities, therapeutics are being advanced to target the inflammatory response that can lead to Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS) and is associated with high mortality (Box 1). These include anti-GM-CSF agents, anti-IL-6 agents, JAK inhibitors, and complement inhibitors. Another emerging option for patients at this stage is convalescent plasma, which has shown some clinical benefits in cases of COVID-19 and related viral diseases (SARS-1, MERS) at various stages of severity (Box 1). Administration of convalescent plasma containing active specific antiviral antibodies may prevent or attenuate progression to severe disease. Expanded access to convalescent plasma for treatment of patients with COVID-19 has been approved by the FDA for emergency IND use and is available through a nationwide program led by Mayo Clinic (Box 1).",

In the event of symptom exacerbation, often marked by worsening respiratory distress, medical evaluation is warranted, and possible hospitalization. The mainstay of treatment for COVID-19, remains supportive care, and as needed supplemental oxygen. Experimental therapies intended to block SARS-CoV2 viral entry and inhibit steps in the viral life cycle necessary for viral replication have been proposed at this early stage (Figure 2) .

However, the augmented curation approach described here allows for the active monitoring of all such symptoms as they emerge in the EHR; this may accelerate the identification of novel disease symptomatology. As a case in point, the CDC recently expanded its list of possible symptom indicators of COVID-19 to include new loss of taste or smell, headache, muscle pain, and repeated shaking with chills (www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). As awareness of these symptoms grows, we expect their presence in the EHR to also grow, making statistical enrichment observations, such as those presented here, more robust. Another salient consideration is that as serologybased tests for COVID-19 with high sensitivity and specificity are approved, testing will become more aggressive and \"day 0\" as defined in the present work will likely occur earlier in the COVID-19 illness course. Additionally, as at-home serology-based testing is advanced, capturing symptoms that precede clinical testing will become increasingly important in order to facilitate the continued development and refinement of disease models; EHR-integrated digital health tools may help address this need. Finally, as multiple COVID-19 testing approaches are pursued and patients begin to receive multiple tests of different types, it will be important to leverage EHR curation tools to assess false positive rates of early serology testing and to gain insight into and optimize test sequencing.",

As the anecdotal single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) based co-expression analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on normal human samples conducted here highlights, the rich heterogeneity of cell types constituting various host tissues can be investigated in great detail by scRNA-seq. To correlate patterns of molecular expression from scRNA-seq with EHR-derived phenotypic signals of COVID-19 disease progression, a large-scale bio-banking system has to be created. Such a system will enable deep molecular insights into COVID-19 to be gleaned and triangulated with SARS-CoV-2 tropism and patient outcomes.",
