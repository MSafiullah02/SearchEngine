            "text": "Unfortunately, we have only a few approved agents for other respiratory viruses and the use of these agents is typically limited to specific risk groups like infants and immunocompromised hosts. One challenge in developing both vaccines and therapeutics for non\u2010influenza respiratory viruses is the diversity of these pathogens, representing six major virus families, primarily RNA but also DNA viruses, and numerous serotypes and genotypes. The pathogenesis of these infections ranges broadly depending on the virus, host, and clinical setting, and for many of these illnesses, it remains uncertain to what extent inhibition of viral replication would be associated with clinical benefits. Most of the treatment data regarding antivirals for non\u2010influenza respiratory viruses have been derived from observational studies in immunocompromised hosts, and sometimes, infants, but recent randomized, controlled trials in specific target populations have helped to address the potential value of antiviral interventions. The following commentary, based on a presentations by the author at the 2nd meeting of the International Society of Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses Antiviral Interest Group, Hanoi, November 2012, and at the XVth International Symposium on Respiratory Viral Infections, Rotterdam, March 2013, is a highly selective review of antiviral treatment interventions that show particular promise for specific respiratory viruses. It focuses primarily on clinical reports but also includes some observations from pre\u2010clinical studies.",

In SARS patients, the role of antiviral therapy was supported by finding that viral load was positively correlated with the development of organ dysfunction and death.12 SARS was characterized by protracted virus replication, peaking during the second week of illness, prominent host pro\u2010inflammatory responses, and histologic evidence for diffuse alveolar damage. Few data regarding viral replication patterns and disease pathogenesis are currently available for MERS\u2010CoV infections, although prolonged viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, extrapulmonary virus detection, lung injury, respiratory failure and often renal failure are notable features in reported cases.8, 9, 10, 11\n",

Although corticosteroids were widely used for treating those with progressive SARS\u2010related pneumonia in efforts to reduce excessive pro\u2010inflammatory responses and presumed immune\u2010mediated tissue damage, their benefits were not conclusively demonstrated, and various reports documented increases in the plasma viral loads, opportunistic infections, and both immediate and delayed (e.g., osteonecrosis) side effects.12, 17, 18, 19 In addition, systematic reviews of the observational reports concluded that the common use of multiple agents in combination, varying dose regimens, paucity of studies with systematic data collection, complications from immunosuppressive therapy, and the lack of randomized, controlled trials meant that existing data were inconclusive with regard to putative antivirals and thus inadequate to determine appropriate management of SARS infections.12, 18, 19\n",

One small pediatric study found no correlation between ribavirin administration and plasma SARS RNA levels.23 In SARS patients, ribavirin was associated also with significant toxicities, including hemolytic anemia and metabolic disturbances like hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia.24 One recent in vitro study found that very high ribavirin concentrations were inhibitory for MERS\u2010CoV in Vero and LLC\u2010MK2 cells but that when combined with recombinant human interferon\u2010alfa2b, lower concentrations were inhibitory.25 Consequently, ribavirin's possible role in treating CoV infections remains uncertain.",

Of note, the MERS\u2010CoV has been shown to be readily inhibited by type I and III interferons in human bronchial epithelium ex vivo.30, 31 Such observations are sufficiently encouraging to support controlled studies of systemic interferon in affected patients. In addition, one approved agent for selected parasitic infections, oral nitazoxanide, may have interferon\u2010inducing properties, is inhibitory for various respiratory viruses including influenza and a canine CoV in vitro,32 and has shown promising dose\u2010related activity in a phase 2, placebo\u2010controlled, randomized trial in treating uncomplicated influenza33 Consequently, nitazoxanide would be an interesting agent to test alone and in combination with other antivirals for CoV infections.",

Recombinant and plasma\u2010derived human MBL bind to the S protein through one or more N\u2010linked glycosylation sites and inhibit SARS\u2010CoV replication in susceptible cell lines at concentrations below those observed in the serum of healthy individuals.42 The cell entry inhibitory effect appears to be mediated in part by blocking viral binding to C\u2010type lectins but apparently not to the ACE2 receptor.42 No in vivo therapeutic studies have been reported in SARS, but high doses of recombinant human MBL showed activity in a lethal Ebola virus model in mice.43 Because MBL binds to carbohydrates on the surface of a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza, paramyxoviruses, and coronavirus, and other important pathogens, MBL is a potential therapeutic intervention of general interest.",

However, a recent retrospective analysis of one center's experience concluded that the addition of palivizumab to aerosolized ribavirn did not improve outcomes in RSV\u2010infected HSCT recipients.49a A recent randomized controlled trial comparing two aerosolized ribavirin regimens found that intermittent delivery (2 g over 2 hours every 8 hours) appeared to be more effective in preventing lower respiratory progression than a standard continuous one (6 g over 18 hoursr) and was easier to administer.50 While data on oral ribavirin are very limited, one study suggested favorable outcomes in HSCT recipients with upper respiratory RSV infection when used in combination with IVIg and palivizumab.51 However, a recent retrospective analysis of hematologic malignancy and HSCT patients with RSV or other paramyxovirus infections concluded that oral ribavirin was not clinically effective in preventing mortality.52 In lung transplant recipients with RSV or human metapneumovirus infections, observational studies suggest that ribavirin given intravenously or orally may be beneficial with regard to improving clinical outcomes and recovery of lung function,53, 54 but the uncontrolled nature of these findings precludes firm conclusions. Further controlled studies of oral ribavirin, which is less expensive and easier to administer than aerosolized ribavirin, are warranted in these important patient groups.",

One case series of 13 immunocompromised patients, the majority of whom were HSCT recipients, described its use in severe adenovirus disease.79 All had adenoviremia, and six had disseminated disease involving other organs. Following onset of the adenoviral disease at a median of 75 days post\u2010transplant, they were initially treated with cidofovir, but then switched to CMX001 because of either persistent viral replication or nephrotoxicity.

Past studies of the capsid\u2010binding anti\u2010HRV agent pleconaril showed that early treatment exerted antiviral effects and reduced the duration of uncomplicated HRV colds by about 1 day.81 Symptomatic improvement in pleconaril\u2010treated subjects was related to the drug susceptibility of the infecting HRV, and strains with >10\u2010fold reduced susceptibility emerged in about 11% of recipients.82 However, it was not approved for clinical use largely because of potential drug interaction concerns.

Vapendavir recipients also had significant improvements in secondary outcomes including higher peak expiratory flow rates on day 5, reduced overall use of asthma relief medications, and less frequent HRV RNA detection on day 3 (74% versus 91%).

Recently, 14 days treatment with an inhaled interferon\u2010beta designated SNG001 (Synairgen plc, Southampton, England) was associated with therapeutic efficacy in a phase 2, placebo\u2010controlled RCT of adult asthmatics receiving inhaled corticosteroids who had a history of deterioration with colds(NCT01126177).87 Among 147 enrolled, 134 met the criteria for a cold; HRVs represented 68% of the respiratory viruses detected. Although the trial did not meet its primary endpoint (changes in the shortened Asthma Control Questionnaire) in the overall population, among the subset of \u201cdifficult to treat\u201d asthma patients representing about one\u2010half of those enrolled, inhaled SNG001 was associated with significant improvements in asthma symptoms, 65% fewer moderate exacerbations, improved morning peak expiratory flow rates, and reduced use of relief bronchodilators. While the findings in the oral vapendavir and inhaled interferon\u2010beta studies need to be confirmed in larger trials, the results suggest that early antiviral treatment of colds in asthmatics can moderate asthma exacerbations.",

            "text": "In summary, currently, there are many unmet medical needs and few approved agents for the non\u2010influenza respiratory virus infections. Recent studies have provided encouraging results in serious respiratory viral infections in hospitalized immunocompromised hosts and in outpatient asthmatics with colds. While additional trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of the agents discussed above, these or other selective antivirals offer the opportunity to expand therapeutic studies to other patient populations. One of the challenges in developing more effective therapeutics is the diversity of respiratory viruses and the differences in disease pathogenesis across viruses and patient groups. In addition to DAS181 for PIV, several agents in clinical development for influenza (e.g., favipiravir, nitazoxanide) have in vitro activity against several other respiratory viruses.32, 88 In addition, analogous to work in influenza,89 one forward\u2010looking strategy is understanding how respiratory viruses interact with host cellular pathways during replication and identifying potential viral\u2013host protein interactions to target. For example, one large mRNA gene expression database search identified 67 common pathways among seven different respiratory viruses; of the top five pathways, 53 had differentially expressed genes affected by at least five of the seven viruses.90 Such studies might lead to identifying existing drugs that could be repurposed to target these pathways and eventually to broader spectrum antiviral agents.",
