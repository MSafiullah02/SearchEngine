We do not know who will require increased pressures or FiO2, resulting in sustained lung injuries. We do not know who will breathe asynchronously with the ventilator, thus requiring increasing doses of sedatives. We do not know who will simply die from their underlying illness, despite mechanical ventilation. We do not know who will survive to extubation, only to ultimately succumb to pneumonia or urosepsis while undergoing rehabilitation. All of these unknowns often result in doctors uncomfortable in talking about risks and benefits of intubation with their patients until it is clear that the patient has progressed to a point of needing respiratory support. And there is, inherently, never a right moment to have this conversation.",
