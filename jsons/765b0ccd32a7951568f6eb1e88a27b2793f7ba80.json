Symptoms include a quotidian or double quotidian fever, a peri-febrile cutaneous eruption, polyarthritis and, in severe cases, multiorgan involvement. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-18, interferon (IFN)-g, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor are elevated in patients with AOSD and are thought to have a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease. 1 High index of clinical suspicion and careful investigation are required to make an early diagnosis so that aggressive treatment can be initiated. There is no single diagnostic test for AOSD; rather, the diagnosis is based on sets of clinical and laboratory criteria. Several sets of classification criteria have been published for AOSD. They have all been developed from retrospective data and classify criteria as major or minor. Table 14 .1 compares the most recent Fautrel criteria 3 with the widely used original Yamaguchi's criteria. 2 Diagnosis of AOSD usually necessitates the exclusion of infectious, neoplastic, and other autoimmune diseases. The diseases to exclude have been described in Table 14.2. AOSD management greatly depends on the severity and chronicity of symptoms and the predominant disease pattern, systemic, or arthritic. Initial attacks may be effectively treated with short courses of systemic corticosteroids and may never recur.

The prevalence of RHS in AOSD may be as high as 12%, as suggested by 5 The hallmark of this syndrome is excessive activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages with massive hypercytokinemia with high levels of interleukin-1b, interleukin-6, interferon-g, and TNF-a. This activation cascade produces an overwhelming inflammatory reaction. RHS can occur at any time during the course of AOSD. Moreover, a simultaneous diagnosis of AOSD and RHS is not uncommon. Flares of AOSD and RHS may be clinically indistinguishable, with the exception of a higher frequency of pleuritis and ARDS in RHS. Biological findings are certainly more sensitive in evoking the diagnosis of RHS during flares of AOSD. Leucopenia or thrombocytopenia is uncommon in AOSD and hence can serve as an alert. Raised serum triglyceride level is considered to be a good marker of the hemophagocytic syndrome, 6 but it has not been specifically analyzed in flares of AOSD. The treatment of secondary RHS has included a variety of chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressive agents including corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG). 7 In the absence of controlled studies, case reports and small series have been used for insight in the management of MAS. Treatment with high-dose steroids is effective in most patients. Immunosuppressants may cause a reduction in mortality in patients where RHS was precipitated by an underlying autoimmune process. It has been reported that cyclosporine or etoposide would be effective in steroid-refractory cases. Etanercept has been reported as an alternative for RHS patients refractory to steroids, cyclosporine-A, and IVIG therapy. 8 The similarity in presentations and the high frequency of RHS in patients with AOSD have prompted experts to consider these conditions as the two ends of the spectrum, with classic AOSD being the mild form and RHS with multiorgan involvement the most severe, life-threatening one. A common pathogenetic link, that is, IL18, a pivotal AOSD cytokine, has been suggested in a recent study. A study of 20 patients, with 21 separate hemophagocytic episodes meeting the International Histiocyte Society criteria, showed that serum IL-18 concentrations were significantly higher in the affected population when compared to healthy controls. 9 In addition, investigators observed an imbalance between IL-18 and IL-18-binding peptide (BP is IL18's natural inhibitor), where concentrations of IL-18BP were insufficient to bind the entire amount of circulating IL-18. A paradoxical decrease of natural killer (NK) cell numbers and cytotoxic functions in secondary RHS was also observed. Based on this study, the authors proposed the potential use of exogenous recombinant IL-18BP, in addition to traditional therapy, for the treatment of severe cases of RHS.",

            "text": "The evolution of AOSD from the acute syndrome, where often systemic complaints such as fever and rash predominate, into the chronic articular pattern is a negative prognostic sign. There is less of a chance for spontaneous remission, and the associated polyarthritis can be destructive if left untreated and lead to increased morbidity and disability. Fortunately, in most cases of AOSD, polyarthritis methotrexate (MTX), with or without small doses of oral corticosteroids, can be very effective in controlling the symptoms and preventing radiographic progression. 10 However, MTX refractoriness has been frequently documented and alternative therapies have been sought. In the prebiologic era, alternative DMARDs were tried, alone or in combination. In a small series where cyclosporin-A was tried, remission in 66% of cases and improvement in the other 33% were reported. 11 Sulfasalazine should be avoided in treatment of AOSD as multiple studies proved low efficacy and high drug toxicity (60% vs. 15% of other drugs) related to treatment with sulfasalazine. 12 CD34-selected autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation was attempted in some cases of refractory disease and prolonged remission was achieved after transplantation. 13 Other less studied agents include hydrochloroquine, gold, penicillamin, leflunomide, azathioprine, tacrolimus, and cyclophosphamide. Recent advances in the immunopathogenesis of AOSD and the availability of biologic DMARDs for the treatment of RA has led to their off-label use in refractory AOSD with variable success. In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa, IL-1, and IL-6 were targeted.",

Nonetheless, the clinician should keep in mind that adults with known cardiac involvement may be at a higher risk of developing cardiac decompensation, especially in the acute systemic subgroup of AOSD. Pouchot et al. described series of 23 cases of pericarditis in their 62 cases of AOSD (37%), 3 of which developed tamponade. 19 The optimal treatment for AOSD-associated pericarditis has not been defined due to the rarity of its occurrence and the lack of controlled studies. Individual approach should be used in treatment of patients with pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. In cases of mild pericarditis, NSAIDs alone may suffice. Systemic use of steroids remains controversial. Lietman and Bywaters 20 in their series of patients with pericarditis did not demonstrate efficacy of steroids in altering the course of pericarditis. However, steroids may be useful in the presence of massive effusion, evidence of cardiac compromise, or progression of effusions not responding to NSAIDs. Drainage of pericardial fluid remains the cornerstone of therapy in the presence of significant cardiac compromise.",

The most characteristic paradigm of such severe life-threatening complication with significant morbidity and mortality would be the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS development has been reported in several patients with AOSD, often complicated by multiorgan involvement and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 22, 23 More recently, Sari et al. presented a case of chronic AOSD complicated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) during an acute flare of the disease. 24 It is not known whether the association between AOSD and DAH is coincidental or whether there is a common pathophysiologic link.",

Recently, Chen et al. described high levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) in patients with active untreated AOSD and proposed that elevated serum sICAM-1 level may be a predictor of liver dysfunction in AOSD. Moreover, serum sICAM-1 levels significantly correlated with disease activity and serum ferritin levels which have also been utilized to monitor disease activity in adult Still's. 26 In any case, close monitoring of LFTs is warranted in AOSD patients, especially early in the disease course, since it often parallels disease activity and abnormalities have been shown to respond to successful treatment.",

In 2010, Liu et al. 32 reported a refractory case of AIH during an AOSD relapse, successfully treated with plasma exchange after other treatment options were exhausted. After five plasmapheresis sessions, autoantibody titers were normalized, as well as serum IgG, LDH, and serum ferritin. Furthermore, leukocytosis and LFT abnormalities resolved. This case was in sharp contrast to other AIH cases, reported by the same authors that had fatal outcomes after treatment with systemic corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin alone.

A hypothesis by Elkon in 1982 that a smoldering vasculitis, mediated by non-necrotizing immune complexes, may support the hypothesis that GN is part of the disease. The possibility of a more active renal process can be supported by the significant decrease in proteinuria after anti-inflammatory treatment. In general, aggressive immunosuppression is recommended in patients with proliferative forms of GN, with a high histological score for active lesions and a low score for chronic lesions. Biologic agents, such as TNF-a blockers, have been suggested as an alternative in AOSD-associated GN refractory to standard immunosuppressants. 14 Amyloidosis may be a more common AOSD-related renal complication leading to proteinuria and has been described in several case reports and series.

The majority of the cases can be readily managed after proper diagnosis. However, the disease has been associated with rare but serious complications that are associated with significant morbidity and, even, mortality. The clinician should be aware of such complications and be able to recognize them and refer appropriately for specialized care. Significant advances in our understanding of the disease pathophysiology and the recent availability of targeted biologic treatments have enhanced our ability to intervene therapeutically.",
