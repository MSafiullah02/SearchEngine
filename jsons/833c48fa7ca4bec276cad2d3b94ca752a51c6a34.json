Rates of do-not-intubate orders increased over time from 9% in 2000-2004 to 32% in 2015-2019. Only 12 studies (46%) reported information about do-not-intubate decision-making processes.

A decision to not pursue invasive mechanical ventilation may be reflected in the patient's medical record with a do-not-intubate (DNI) order. Decisions to pursue DNI may occur at any point in a patient's medical course-in the outpatient setting, on the medical ward or emergency department, or when the patient has respiratory failure in the ICU. Such decisions may be revisited when the patient's diagnosis, prognosis, or goals of medical treatment change.",

Placement of DNI orders and thus withholding of invasive mechanical ventilation may facilitate delivery of treatment that is in agreement with patient preferences and goals [5] . Notwithstanding, more than half of all patients with acute respiratory failure who receive noninvasive ventilation and also have a DNI order survive to hospital discharge-often with no worse quality of life compared to those without a DNI order [4] .",

First, 1 in 4 patients who utilize noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula for acute respiratory failure has a DNI order. Second, there is high inter-study variability in published rates of DNI orders, even when [7, [40] [41] [42] . Characteristics of patients, families, physicians, and hospitals (including ethical climates, implementation of advance care planning, as well as availability of ICU beds and ventilators) also play important roles [7, 8, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . A recent global analysis of clinicians' views on ethical aspects of withholding and withdrawing life support showed that although there are important differences between countries and hospitals within a country, the largest differences are accounted for by differences between individual clinicians within a hospital [40] . Increasing rates of DNI orders over the past 20 years may reflect increased focus on high quality end-of-life care, changing ethical climates [55, 56] , or increased recognition of the utility of noninvasive ventilation in patients who are not candidates for intubation. Higher rates of DNI orders in Europe and Asia (compared to North America) could also reflect these same principles (e.g., increased physician anticipation of end-of-life). Patients with DNI orders have variable goals of care (ranging from curative intent to solely symptom relief ). Therefore, it is important to evaluate DNI orders in the context other potential treatment limitations such as DNR orders or orders to stop all life-prolonging treatments such as antibiotics, dialysis, surgery, etc. (\"comfort measures only\"). Shared decision making, a collaborative decision-making process involving both physician and patient/family input, has been endorsed by a panel of experts from 32 countries worldwide [59] . Nevertheless, integration of shared decision making into practice is variable and there are few tools to help clinicians, patients, and families. In some settings, written DNI orders may not accurately reflect patient wishes-as some patients with written DNI orders may actually prefer a trial of intubation as long as the ventilator would be withdrawn if intubation becomes prolonged [60] . Nevertheless, in countries where life support withdrawal may be culturally unacceptable or even illegal, there may be a greater tendency to avoid intubation altogether.",

            "text": "Our manuscript has several limitations. First, there was significant heterogeneity of included studies and we were methodologically unable to perform a multivariate analysis. Second, we could not account for institutional variation in multi-center studies which reported pooled estimates only. Third, data regarding patient/family involvement may be limited as reporting these data was not a primary purpose of many included studies. Fourth, we presented observational data only and did not evaluate the association of DNI status or treatments used on clinical outcomes. Fifth, study results may not generalize to institutions, where such epidemiological studies have not been performed. Sixth, DNI rates may be different in patients who were not receiving noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Seventh, evaluations for characteristics such as patient age and illness severity were based on study population means, as we were unable to perform individual patient data analysis. Eighth, 65% of included studies were of low methodological quality; nevertheless, there were no significant DNI rate differences based on quality. In conclusion, while this manuscript builds on the previous work to categorize DNI-specific variability, significant work remains to explore the non-physiological indications for clinician choice to provide noninvasive oxygenation support to patients in respiratory failure. Future considerations also include evaluating the impact of DNI orders and treatments (e.g., noninvasive ventilation) on short-and long-term outcomes when adjusted for individual patient characteristics, as well as the development and testing of interventions to improve DNI decision making. Truly understanding DNI variability across continents can only be achieved by benchmarking long-term outcomes in patients with and without DNI orders across geographical regions, cultures, and ethical climates. Fig. 2 Rates of do-not-intubate orders in patients with acute respiratory failure according to mean age of study participants. The diamond under each subgroup represents the pooled proportion of patients with do-not-intubate (DNI) orders. The width of the diamond represents the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the pooled proportion. Median age was used when the mean was not available Spain DNI was based on physician assessment of \"age, comorbidities, or poor prognosis. \" DNI status was then \"reported to the family. \"",
