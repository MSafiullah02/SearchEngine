            "text": "blossom bats). In 2006, Calisher et al. [2] updated this comprehensive list of viruses isolated from bats. Many viruses were serendipitously isolated as part of field surveillance work, and for most viruses, bats did not feature in the known epidemiology of the disease that the viruses cause. Among reservoirs for the genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae, bats are well represented. Perhaps it is to be expected that, in the genus in which the type species is the archetypal bat virus, rabies virus, all related viruses (with the exception of Mokola virus) have been isolated from bats. The other families in which bats are well represented as reservoirs include the Flaviviridae and the Bunyaviridae. In the genus Flavivirus, Rio Bravo virus group, all original isolates are from bats. In total, 18 flaviviruses and 12 bunyaviruses have been isolated from bats, but only 7 of these are considered medically important viruses (among flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus; and among bunyaviruses, Hantaan virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Toscana virus), and the role that bats play in the epidemiology of the diseases that they cause is not believed to be significant. Interest in bats was renewed at the end of the 20th century, when during !5 years, 5 new viruses belonging to the order Mononegavirales were discovered (figure 1). All of these viruses appeared to have bats as a reservoir host, and 3 of these, Australian bat lyssavirus, Hendra virus, and Nipah virus, caused serious human disease. Most recently, bats have been identified as the reservoir host of serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus-like coronaviruses [3] (figure 1). Additionally, some researchers speculate that bats may also be the reservoir host for Ebola virus [4] . Here we expand on recent findings about bats and viruses and their relevance to human infections, beginning with a brief history of chiropteran virology.",

During daylight hours, bats were observed approaching animals and trying to bite them. Carini [5] suspected that these bats were involved in the transmission of the rabies virus. Haupt and Rehaag, 2 German veterinarians who were called to investigate the outbreaks, could prove the presence of Negri bodies in the brain of captured bats, and this resulted in the first proven causal link between bats and viral disease [1] . It was not until the rabies virus was isolated from an insectivorous bat in the United States in 1953 that investigators began to focus their attention on this flying mammal as a possible reservoir host for this virus in nature. At this time, investigators also began to consider that bats may be reservoir hosts for other viruses.",

A new paramyxovirus, Hendra virus, was responsible for the deaths of 2 humans and 15 horses during 2 separate outbreaks [7] . After extensive epidemiological investigations, it was determined that fruit bats, namely those belonging to the genus Pteropus, were the most likely reservoir hosts. Shortly thereafter, this new virus was isolated from a number of pteropid bats [8] . During these investigations, a new rhabdovirus, Australian bat lyssavirus, was isolated from a pteropid bat [9] . When another 2 RNA viruses were discovered as part of disease outbreak investigations, authorities immediately looked to bats as possible reservoir hosts. Menangle virus was responsible for a large number of fetal deaths at a commercial piggery, and antibodies capable of neutralizing Menangle virus have been found in pteropid bats [10] . Nipah virus swept through numerous piggeries in Malaysia and killed 1100 people during the period from 1998 through 1999. Local pteropid bats were identified as having antibodies capable of neutralizing Nipah virus, and eventually the virus was isolated from bat excreta in Malaysia [11] . In Bangladesh, 170 people have been killed in annual Nipah virus outbreaks since 2001, and once again, local pteropid bats have been identified as having antibodies capable of neutralizing Nipah virus [12] [13] [14] . The natural history and pathogenesis of Hendra virus and Nipah virus is reviewed by Daszak et al. [15] and Field et al. [16] . During investigations of Nipah virus in Malaysia, 2 previously unrecognized viruses, Tioman virus and Pulau virus, were isolated from bat excreta [17, 18] (figure 1). More recently, although civets were originally implicated in the SARS outbreak in China, the true wildlife reservoir was found to be bats, which are also sold in wet markets [3] . During !10 years, 7 new RNA viruses were isolated from bats in Southeast Asia and Australia. Different species of bats with different geographic ranges were implicated.",

This is clearly demonstrated with the recently emerged paramyxoviruses. To date, Hendra virus, isolated from the Australian species of pteropid bats, has been responsible for disease only in spillover hosts (horses) on the east coast of Australia. All human infections have occurred as a result of exposure to infected horses-thus, the limited geographic distribution of human disease. The Malaysian strain of Nipah virus, isolated from Malaysian species of pteropid bats, has caused disease only in spillover hosts (the major one being pigs) in that country, and, similarly, human infections occurred as a result of exposure to infected pigs. The Bangladesh strain of Nipah virus has caused disease only in spillover hosts (humans) in that region. In all of these examples, if the reservoir host was not afforded the opportunity of coming in contact with the spillover host, human disease would not have ensued.",

The major cause of infectious disease emergence can be linked to human activities [19] . Examples include agricultural expansion into pristine forests, as occurred in Malaysia where Nipah virus emerged; wildlife trade, in which many species of animals are brought together at high density with humans, which led to the emergence of SARS in China; or global travel, during which people can expand the range of a virus by carrying it on planes, which led to the global spread of SARS. If one were to try to predict spillover events, it would be prudent to focus on the geographic range of the reservoir host. Changes in this range may create new opportunities for the virus, particularly if this change results in the reservoir host coming in contact with a suitable spillover host. Bat phylogeny and viral phylogeny may also suggest where we may see new viruses emerge.",

For example, an orthoreovirus (Nelson Bay virus) was recovered from a grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) in eastern Australia [20] . Although no diseases have been associated with this virus, interest has been rekindled by the isolation of 2 related orthoreoviruses from flying foxes in different geographic locations. Pulau virus was isolated in Malaysia from Pteropus hypomelanus, and Broome virus was isolated from Pteropus alecto in northern Australia [18] (Cummins, Lunt, and Wang, personal communication). Although the bat orthoreoviruses are currently not considered to have any zoonotic potential, they are examples of viruses evolving in geographically separated bat populations (figure 2). The phylogeny of these bats and their associated viruses supports the theory of viral coevolution with their chiropteran hosts. This theory is further supported by the isolation of new paramyxoviruses and lyssaviruses isolated from bats in Australia and Southeast Asia (figure 3) and the large number of coronaviruses found in various bats at different locations in China [21, 22] . These patterns of similar-yet distinct-viruses in similar-yet distinct-species of bats preempts the discovery of \"new\" chiropteran viruses. With regard to the lyssaviruses, one can take the example beyond the bat genus level. Although there appears to be little genetic variation among Australian bat lyssavirus isolates within the genus Pteropus throughout Australia, isolates from insectivorous bats (Saccolamus flaviventris) are sufficiently different to group in a second clade [23] . One explanation for this is that when chiropteran divergence took place millions of years ago, each suborder took with it its own variant of Australian bat lyssavirus.",

Although recent work has made progress of understanding bat-virus interactions at the molecular and individual host level, we are still in our infancy when it comes to understanding how these interactions play out at the population and ecosystem levels. Consider the 4 viruses that emerged from pteropid bats within 5 years: Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Menangle virus, and Australian bat lyssavirus. The fact that 4 viruses emerged from 1 host genus within a short period of time strongly suggests that host factors play a role in emergence. However, unraveling the ecological changes that caused emergence requires a detailed understanding of how host biology interacts with the rapidly changing ecosystems on which these bats depend. For bat diseases, this is generally an immense challenge. Bats have historically been underappreciated by both the general public and the scientific community, and therefore, basic data on bat disease ecology and immunology are lacking. Furthermore, bats have incredibly complex population structures and are highly mobile, nocturnal, and often difficult to catch. They also exhibit some unique life-history traits that may influence their interactions with viruses in ways that we do not yet understand. For example, bats are the only mammals that fly, they have very short digestive tracts, they have unusual dietary preferences, and many species hibernate.",

Hendra virus researchers used a modeling framework to show that habitat fragmentation may change the dynamics of Hendra virus infection within Pteropus species, leading to increased risk of emergence among horses and humans [24] . In other cases, observational and epidemiological studies have been able to identify putative causes of emergence. For example, there is evidence that planting fruit trees around piggeries caused increased bat and pig contact in Malaysia, leading to the spillover of Nipah virus to pigs [15] . With this knowledge, appropriate controls can be implemented to prevent future spillover events. In Queensland, Australia, advice to horse owners includes placing horses in paddocks that do not contain trees attractive to bats for either feeding or roosting. In addition, horse feed bins or watering points should not be placed under trees when there is a risk of bats using that tree for feeding, resting, or roosting. ",
