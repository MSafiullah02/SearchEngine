Several blood clots were seen in the lamina propria and in the submucosa, and the parietal layers were dissociated due to edema and inflammatory infiltrates (Figure 1E).

In patients 1 and 2, the presence of micro-thrombi and inflammatory infiltrates seemed to be at the origin of the ischemic event, as the rest of the bowel was strictly normal (i.e. with no sign of generalized low flow). Consequently, questions are raised regarding the natural history of bowel inflammation towards ischemia in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 might also favor a hypercoagulation status, thrombi formation and ischemia, as recently advocated for the etiology of acro-ischemia (3). Mucosal ischemia might further induce a massive spread of the viruses from the bowel epithelium (2) and this could be the cause of the patients\u2019 deterioration. This assumption should be further investigated.",
