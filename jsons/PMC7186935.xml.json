            "text": "The vertebrate immune system has traditionally been divided into innate and adaptive arms. Cells of the innate immune system recognize pathogens and tissue damage through germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)1,2, which sense diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns. The processes activated on engagement of PRRs are rapid, are considered to be non-specific and include responses such as phagocytosis, cell locomotion, killing of pathogens or cells, and cytokine production. These innate immune mechanisms are usually very effective in eliminating invading pathogens. Additionally, dendritic cells (DCs) and specialized T cells and B cells drive adaptive immune responses, which can be concomitantly induced. These lymphocyte-dependent adaptive immune responses are slower to develop but are antigen specific and lead to long-term immunological memory3.",

Greater protection against reinfection \u2014 a de facto immune memory function \u2014 has also been reported in plants and invertebrates9\u201311, which lack an adaptive immune system. This demonstrates that adaptation of host defence can occur on the basis of innate-like immune mechanisms. Moreover, certain infections and vaccinations can induce broad protection against other pathogens through innate immune mechanisms5,12. Conversely, the phenomenon called \u2018LPS tolerance\u2019, which can be induced by low doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other Toll-like receptor ligands, is also an adaptation of cellular responses to an external stimulus, but which leads to a lower inflammatory response to a second stimulation13.",

The secondary response to the subsequent non-specific stimulus can be altered in such a way that the cells respond more or less strongly than to the primary response, conferring context-adjusted and time-adjusted responses. It is important to underline that trained immunity represents the concept of long-term adaptation of innate immune cells rather than a particular transcriptional or functional programme: indeed, different stimuli (for example, \u03b2-glucan, LPS or the bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine) can induce different trained immunity programmes.",

This \u2018on demand\u2019 production of novel and diverse receptors forms the basis for lymphocyte-mediated specific immune memory responses in jawed vertebrates (the gnathostomes)18. An alternative adaptive immune system evolved in jawless vertebrates, in which specific lymphocyte-mediated immune memory is mediated by variable lymphocyte receptors generated via the somatic rearrangement of gene elements encoding leucine-rich repeat motifs19. Both immunoglobulin-based and variable lymphocyte receptor-based adaptive immune processes in highly differentiated immune cells (that is, memory T cells and B cells or gnathostome lymphocytes) induce a recall immune response to the previously encountered pathogen that is both stronger and highly specific to the pathogen, ensuring improved survival of the organism.",

For example, vaccination with the BCG vaccine was shown to protect animals against secondary infections with Candida albicans, Schistosoma mansoni and Mycobacterium tuberculosis30\u201332. The non-specific character of the protection argues against a significant role of adaptive immunity for mediating this type of cross protection and suggests activation of rather non-specific protective innate immune mechanisms. The BCG vaccine also protects against lethal candidiasis in SCID mice, which lack functional T cells and B cells23,33,34. Similarly, a prior mild infection with C. albicans protects against the subsequent exposure to a normally lethal candidiasis infection35 in both athymic mice and in recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1)-deficient mice, further demonstrating the T cell-independent mechanisms of trained immunity36,37. In these studies, the ability of a prior infection to provide protection against infection with unrelated pathogens was dependent on macrophages35 and on proinflammatory cytokine production38. Importantly, a recent study showed that multiple passages of C. albicans through the gut of mice, leading to an adaptation of the fungus towards colonization, results in a stronger capacity to induce trained immunity and improved protection against non-specific infections in a lymphocyte-independent manner39.",

First, an extensive collection of epidemiological data argues that live vaccines such as the BCG vaccine, measles vaccine, smallpox vaccine and oral polio vaccine have beneficial, non-specific protective effects against infections other than the target diseases40\u201347 (for a review, see also ref.48). Subsequently, proof-of-principle trials with the BCG vaccine in adults23,49 and children50,51 demonstrated that this vaccine induces non-specific activation of innate immune cells. Interestingly, both epidemiological and immunological studies have shown that the vaccine effects may last for months, but may also be modified or even reversed when a non-live vaccine is given52,53. Furthermore, BCG vaccination led to protection against microorganisms in models of controlled human infection, such as yellow fever54 or malaria55, and this was associated with an augmented proinflammatory activity of monocytes (Box 1). Second, certain infections, such as malaria, induce a state of hyper-responsiveness that is functionally equivalent to induction of trained immunity56\u201358. Finally, there is evidence that BCG vaccination can induce antitumour immune effects leading to the prevention or treatment of malignancies such as bladder cancer59, melanoma60, leukaemia61 and lymphoma62. Notably, these anticancer effects of BCG seem to be dependent on its capacity to induce trained immunity in monocytes and macrophages63.",

            "text": "The cellular basis of the protection induced by trained immunity during bacterial and fungal infections resides in the functional reprogramming of myeloid cells. Some of the first evidence that macrophages have adaptive features came from investigations of LPS tolerance, which demonstrated that gene-specific chromatin modifications were associated with the silencing of genes coding for inflammatory molecules and the priming of other genes encoding antimicrobial molecules64. Subsequent studies showed that exposure of monocytes or macrophages to C. albicans or the fungal cell wall component \u03b2-glucan enhanced the subsequent response of these myeloid cells to stimulation with unrelated pathogens or pathogen-associated molecular patterns37. Induction of trained immunity in monocytes was accompanied by the alteration of several chromatin marks37,65. In addition to the data from infections with bacterial and fungal pathogens, other studies have shown that monocytes or macrophages can mount trained immune responses following infection with parasites66. Recent work has shown that DCs can also show immune memory responses. In this regard, DCs isolated from mice exposed to the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans displayed strong interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) production and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine responses on subsequent challenge, which is indicative of a memory response67. These effects were dependent on epigenetic changes and were impaired by the treatment of mice with a histone methyltransferase inhibitor67.",

            "text": "Certain viral infections also exert protective effects independently of adaptive immunity. For example, herpesvirus latency increases resistance to the bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis68, with protection achieved through enhanced production of IFN\u03b3 and systemic activation of macrophages. In the past decade, a unique anamnestic response has been described in natural killer (NK) cells during cytomegalovirus infection. Experimental studies demonstrated that mouse and human NK cells possess adaptive immune characteristics following infection with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) or human cytomegalovirus, respectively69\u201373. Mouse NK cells bearing the Ly49H receptor possess antigen specificity for MCMV-encoded glycoprotein m157 (refs74,75), can undergo clonal proliferation (as much as 104-fold expansion from a single NK cell clone)76,77 and persist during the contraction and memory phases similarly to CD8+ T cells78. On reinfection, these memory NK cells undergo a secondary expansion and can more rapidly degranulate and release cytokines, resulting in a more protective immune response against MCMV69,79. In human NK cells, the NKG2C receptor can mediate a similar function through recognition of human cytomegalovirus-encoded UL40 peptides presented on the non-classical MHC molecule HLA-E80,81. Because these adaptive NK cell responses more closely resemble T cell responses than trained immunity in macrophages, yet occur in the absence of RAG-mediated antigen receptor gene rearrangement82, this unique NK cell response may represent an evolutionary bridge between the memory response of T cells and that of myeloid lineage cells78,83.",

Mouse and human NK cells exposed to IL-12 and IL-18 showed more robust production of IFN\u03b3 weeks after initial priming84,85, and transplantation of these cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells has shown efficacy in clinical trials to treat leukaemias86. Even in the adaptive responses of MCMV-specific NK cells, proinflammatory cytokine signals are critical for the formation of robust effector and memory NK cells87\u201389. It was recently found that liver-resident group 1 ILCs (ILC1s) also expand and persist after infection with MCMV, acquiring stable transcriptional, epigenetic and phenotypical changes 1 month after the resolution of systemic infection, and showed enhanced memory responses90. In this setting, both proinflammatory cytokines and antigen specificity (NK1.1 receptor-mediated recognition of MCMV-encoded m12) were critical in driving a memory response in ILC1s90. ILC2s have also been suggested to possess features of immunological memory following stimulation with allergens91, perhaps resembling prior studies of hapten-induced priming of NK cells in delayed hypersensitivity responses92. Anamnestic immunity in NK cells may also play an important role in physiological processes such as pregnancy. A recent study showed that NK cells from women who have been repeatedly pregnant show a particular epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape, with open chromatin around the enhancers of IFNG and VEGFA, improving placentation and supporting vascular sprouting93.",

The discovery of inflammatory memory behaviour in epidermal stem cells is of particular relevance, as tissue stem cells are the cornerstone of regeneration in homeostasis and they reside in distinct microenvironments or niches and exchange signals that define their tasks and their molecular behaviours6,94. Although the rate of cellular replacement during homeostasis is tissue and context specific, even quiescent stem cells are mobilized into action on tissue injury. Similarly, inflammation and infections perturb the niche microenvironment, which can override the normal homeostatic cues and prompt changes in stem cell behaviours. Thus, through their ability to sense and respond to niche signals, stem cells can adjust to and survive stressful situations. Remarkably, stem cells form an enduring epigenetic memory from such encounters, which equips them with the ability to mobilize more rapidly during subsequent assaults6,95.",

Moreover, stem cells are equipped with receptors to sense whether the epithelial barrier is breached and, in turn, actively recruit immune cells to prevent spread of bacteria and to repair the damage7. Although it is still unfolding, the molecular communication avenue between stem cells and immune cells appears to be bidirectional. Stem cells do not merely take instructions but rather they also actively instruct the immune system. In the skin, for example, stem cells can sense when their niche barrier is breached and produce signals to recruit specific immune cell sentinels, even under conditions where the immune system itself has been suppressed7. In turn, recruited immune cells can signal to stem cells to proliferate and patch the barrier. In this way, the coordination is honed to achieve maximal tissue repair. Another cell type that can acquire a trained immunity-like phenotype is the fibroblast. It was demonstrated that IFN\u03b2 treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts led to faster and higher induction of interferon-stimulated genes that correlated with enhanced recruitment of polymerase II to interferon-stimulated gene loci on restimulation99.",

Conceivably, tissues exposed to the outside world, such as the skin, the lungs and the intestine, are prone to encounter immune training-inducing stimuli. This concept was explored in the lung using two models of viral challenge: namely, latent gammaherpesvirus infection and adenovirus infection106,107. The severity of house dust mite-induced asthma was decreased in the lungs of mice that had previously been chronically infected with gammaherpesvirus106. This phenotype was dependent on the long-term generation and maintenance of monocyte-derived regulatory alveolar macrophages that conferred protection against the development of an allergic response in the lung. Conversely, adenovirus infection induced remodelling in alveolar macrophages, which are long-lived tissue-resident cells, such that they retained the information of an inflammatory history and subsequently induced more pronounced antibacterial immunity107. However, in the case of the adenovirus infection, the tissue-specific training phenotype was dependent on the polarization of CD8+ T cells by trained alveolar macrophages and therefore provided a link between trained and adaptive immunity. Together, these two recent studies highlight the importance of tissue-specific training cues, which are likely to occur consecutively over an individual\u2019s lifespan, raising the question of how these training cues contribute to protection against infections and the development of inflammatory diseases and cancer.",

Many studies have demonstrated that stimulation of innate immune cells can leave an \u2018epigenetic scar\u2019 at the level of stimulated genes, changing the long-term responsiveness of the cells that manifests itself as functional trained immunity programmes. Intrinsic to the presence of such an epigenetic scar is the question of how it is selectively directed to specific locations in the genome, either at the promoters of stimulated genes or at distal regulatory elements. Two key epigenetic marks accompany trained immunity: the acquisition of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) marks at distal enhancers (marked with histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me1)) and the consolidation of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks at the promoters of stimulated genes (Fig. 4). Transcription is an inherently stochastic process, which is regulated by several factors, including the random collision of transcription factors with upstream promoter and enhancer DNA regions. However, dynamic loop-mediated regulation and the resulting stochastic responses in gene expression may not be ideal for gene classes that need to respond both immediately and uniformly to external stimuli across cell populations. This suggests that to reduce stochasticity in gene expression, the chromosomal contact between rapidly responding genes may exist in a more stable or preformed state, which strongly implicates the influence of chromosomal looping and TAD structure on this subclass of transcriptional responses. Studies using Hi-C (a method for analysing chromatin interactions) have revealed that several classes of innate immune genes are segregated into TADs and interact within multigene complexes. A recent study demonstrated how TAD structure enables a class of lncRNAs called \u2018immune gene-priming lncRNAs\u2019 (IPLs) to be brought into close proximity with transcriptionally poised innate immune genes, before their transcriptional activation110. IPLs exploit preformed 3D looping contacts to bring the H3K4me3 histone-modifying complex close to the promoters of highly responsive innate immune genes, permitting their epigenetic activation and training. The insertion of an IPL in the mouse preformed chemokine TAD confers these genes with the ability to transcriptionally respond rapidly and robustly (uniformly across all cells in the population) and to be accessible to training by \u03b2-glucan. The latter is a property they previously did not have in the absence of the IPL110. As current studies have investigated the role of IPLs only in \u03b2-glucan-induced trained immunity phenotypes, further studies are warranted to explore these mechanisms in other experimental settings, including the importance of IPLs during in vivo vaccination.",

How the H3K27ac mark is directed to specific distal enhancer marks (carrying H3K4me1 epigenetic marks) remains an important outstanding question. It is clear from mouse HSC data that after BCG exposure, the acquisition of open chromatin as measured by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) begins in HSCs, and acetylation drives the opening of specific TADs32. The specific locations of these marks are, at least partially, preserved through the differentiation of HSCs into different myeloid and lymphoid lineage cells32. It is likely that in terminally differentiated myeloid cells, the H3K4me1 marks established in the HSC lineage continue to be present, and the gain and loss of H3K27ac occurs in response to exposure to LPS tolerization and \u03b2-glucan priming, even though this question remains to be formally analysed and established. The transmission of these marks through DNA replication and the cell cycle is a central conundrum around how trained immunity is stably maintained111.

The metabolite itaconate, the concentration of which is highly upregulated in LPS-activated macrophages, exerts anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the succinate dehydrogenase-mediated oxidation of succinate to fumarate134,135. Itaconate itself acts in an anti-inflammatory fashion in macrophages by supporting the activity of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor NRF2 (ref.136) and the inhibition of LPS-mediated I\u03baB induction. The latter effect of itaconate is independent of NRF2 but requires activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3)137. Of note, itaconate-induced tolerance in human monocytes is counteracted by \u03b2-glucan-induced trained immunity as \u03b2-glucan inhibits the expression of immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) protein, the enzyme responsible for itaconate generation. Consistent with fumarate accumulation in \u03b2-glucan-trained monocytes131, \u03b2-glucan-mediated inhibition of IRG1 results in elevated expression of succinate dehydrogenase138. Thus, \u03b2-glucan-induced trained immunity is associated with enhanced succinate dehydrogenase activity and accumulation of fumarate as well as with reversing the endotoxin tolerance-inducing effects of itaconate, which acts as an antagonist of succinate dehydrogenase.",

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor fluvastatin blocks trained immunity in primary human monocytes131. Interestingly, this is accomplished not by cholesterol biosynthesis but rather by an accumulation of the upstream metabolite mevalonate. Brief exposure to mevalonate can trigger training of monocytes via the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and stimulation of mTOR signalling139. Importantly, enhanced cholesterol synthesis is critical for the \u03b2-glucan-induced training of not only mature myeloid cells but also of their progenitors (haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)). The long-term myelopoiesis bias conferred to HSPCs by \u03b2-glucan-induced training is associated with accumulation of cholesterol esters and lipids with more saturated acyl chains104. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase diminishes \u03b2-glucan-induced HSPC population expansion and myelopoiesis104. The enhanced cholesterol levels that occur in HSPCs as a result of innate training may promote a myelopoiesis bias via upregulation of CD131, the common \u03b2-subunit of the IL-3/GM-CSF receptor104. This is consistent with findings showing that inhibition of cholesterol efflux in HSPCs, due to deficiency in the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1, also enhances CD131 expression and myelopoiesis in the bone marrow140,141.",

This trained immunity phenotype persisted even after the mice had been switched to a standard chow diet for another 4 weeks, despite circulating cholesterol levels and systemic inflammatory markers returning to normal8. Several small proof-of-principle studies in patients suggest that trained immunity also occurs in the setting of dyslipoproteinaemia: monocytes from patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia are characterized by an enhanced cytokine production capacity and enrichment of H3K4me3 on their promoters, which remains present even after 3 months of cholesterol-lowering statin treatment148. Furthermore, circulating monocytes from patients with severe coronary artery atherosclerosis exhibit a trained immune phenotype in terms of enhanced cytokine production capacity and glycolytic metabolism and epigenetic reprogramming at the level of histone methylation149,150.",

On the other hand, there could be negative consequences. Neurodegenerative diseases constitute a significant group of age-related diseases associated with chronic inflammation153. Peripheral application of inflammatory stimuli in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease leads to long-lasting training of microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, which exacerbates cerebral \u03b2-amyloidosis154. The functional changes of microglia are accompanied by activating epigenetic changes at the HIF1A gene locus, consistent with the peripheral trained immunity response129. As a consequence of epigenetic reprogramming, microglia also show changes in transcription and protein expression. Even infections of mice very early in life as a means of immunological training seem to be able to contribute to the impairment of microglial function followed by amyloid-\u03b2-induced synapse damage and cognitive impairment155. Together, these studies suggest that systemic inflammation induces microglia reprogramming, resulting in potentially hyper-responsive \u2018trained\u2019 states of the brain immune system.",

A causal link to the pathophysiology of the small vessels in the brain remains to be determined. The pathophysiology of acute stroke is unaltered by prior peripheral immune stimulation154, which might suggest that chronic rather than acute inflammatory conditions are associated with both trained immunity and the induction of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Accumulating evidence suggests that there is a link between trained immunity and \u2018inflammageing\u2019, the inflammatory condition related to an ageing immune system158. For example, age-related reprogramming of specific innate immune cells might enhance effector mechanisms associated with trained immunity (such as production of IL-8 (ref.159) and CCL1 (ref.160)), thereby leading to hyper-reactivity. Collectively, a better understanding of the dark side of trained immunity in ageing populations might help us to fight inflammageing-related chronic diseases such as dementia in elderly patients.",

Tumour cells can also reprogramme infiltrating innate immune cells to acquire a more anti-inflammatory phenotype that is reminiscent of the immunoparalysis observed in patients with sepsis; for instance, monocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia show low levels of cytokine production, high phagocytic activity and impaired antigen presentation162.

By contrast, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are long-lived cells with self-renewal properties that reside in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the site of haematopoiesis where HSCs continually undergo asymmetric division giving rise to the full repertoire of myeloid and lymphoid cell types. HSCs can directly respond to acute and chronic infections. Although the exact mechanisms of precursor proliferation or differentiation are not well understood, persistent activation of HSCs can result in their exhaustion, leading to devastating effects on the systemic immune compartment. Monocytes derived from trained HSCs migrate to peripheral organs, where they give rise to monocyte-derived macrophages with enhanced effector functions against different types of pathogens.
