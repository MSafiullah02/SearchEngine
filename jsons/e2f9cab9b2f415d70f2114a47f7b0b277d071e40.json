Histological lesions were localized in the ventral horns of the spinal cord and brain stem. The salient features were the severe vacuolar degeneration of neurones and glial cells and the absence of inflammatory cellular infiltrates. The clinical and pathological features of this outbreak indicate that the SCID mouse would be a much improved model for studying the mechanism of poliovirus infection and of virus-induced demyelinating diseases.",

Natural infection results in replication of TMEV in the gastrointestinal mucosa (Olitsky, 1939; Dal Canto and Lipton, 1977; Zurbriggen and Fujinami, 1988) . Rarely (0.01 per cent), this virus infects the CNS where it causes encephalitis resulting in flaccid paralysis of the hind limbs; front legs are sometimes affected. This is the only clinical sign likely to appear during the course of natural infection. (Lipton and Rozhon, 1986; Jacoby, 1988; Anonymous, 1991) .",

Intracerebral infection (IC) of immunocompetent adult mice with TMEV produces a characteristic biphasic CNS disease (Lipton, 1975) . The early CNS lesions caused by TMEV infection, characterized by degeneration of the motor neurones in the ventral horns of the spinal cord (Penney and Wolinsky, 1979) have been used as a model for the study of the pathogen&s of lesions caused by poliovirus in man (Theiler, 1941; Olitsky, 1945; Lipton, 1975; Penney and Wolinsky, 1979; Rodriguez, Leibowitz, Powell and Lampert, 1983; Jubelt and Meagher, 1984) . The later phases of the lesions caused by TMEV infection, with progressive demyelination (Lipton, 1975) have been intensively studied because of their similarities to chronic virus-induced demyelinating diseases of man, such as multiple sclerosis (Lipton, 1975; Lipton and Dal Canto, 1976a; Dal Canto and Lipton, 1977; Yamada, Zurbriggen and Fujinami, 1990) . The athymic (nu/nu) mouse has been widely utilized as a model for T lymphocyte deficiency. Experiments in these mice (Rosenthal et al., 1986) indicated an important role for the immune system in limiting TMEV. When athymic mice are inoculated with TMEV, they develop severe hind limb paralysis at approximately 2 weeks post-infection, with most animals dying within the first month. The CNS lesions differ in several respects from those observed in immunocompetent mice. The neurones of the ventral horn, as well as those of the dorsal horn show spongiform degeneration.",

It is, however, a common feature of infection by many polio viruses in many different conditions Burch, Tsui, Harb and Colcolough, 197 1; Jubelt and Meagher, 1984) . Furthermore, degenerative chromatolysis, as found in the neurones of the brain stem and spinal cord in this outbreak, has not been previously described in lesions caused by TMEV infection in mice.

Consequently, we were only able to study lesions corresponding to the first (acute) phase of the disease during the lytic infection of CNS cells and not those which would develop if mice had survived to a later stage of chronic persistent infection with demyelination. Mild demyelinating changes have also been observed following TMEV infection of nude mice during the phase of lytic infection of neurones and of oligodendrocytes coinciding with scanty lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration (Rosenthal et al., 1986) . In the present outbreak there was evident vacuolar degeneration of glial cells and mild microcystic degenerative changes of the white matter, similar to those described by Lipton (1975) . These changes occurred in the absence of lymphocytic cell infiltration. Levine, Hardwick, Trapp, Crawford, Bollinger and Griffin (1991) have recently discovered that the persistent infection of the CNS of SCID mice with alphavirus can be cleared by treating the mice with specific antibodies from previously immunized congenic CB 17 mice. Purified suspensions of T lymphocytes from similarly sensitized mice did not succeed in clearing the virus. A similar experimental approach applied to TMEV-infected SCID mice should assist in defining the contribution of the different lymphocytic subpopulations in the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases of viral aetiology (Yamada et al., 1990) . SCID mice can be reconstituted by inoculation of mature lymphocytes, bone marrow or liver grafts from normal H2-identical BALB/c mice. These reconstituted models may prove of great value in understanding the role of the different immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of disease.",

When high titre viraemia occurs, encephalitis ensues (Lipton and Rozhon, 1986; Jacoby, 1988) . The mechanisms that determine these events are poorly understood (Zurbriggen and Fujinami, 1988; Brownstein et al., 1989) , but they are thought to resemble those that determine the occurrence of similar lesions during the course of poliovirus infection in man. The use of TMEV-infected immunocompetent or even nude mice as models of human poliomyelitis virus infection is not entirely satisfactory because in both cases intracerebral inoculation is required. Viral administration through this route bypasses all the defence mechanisms that render CNS infection an infrequent event in the natural disease.",

We aiso propose that immunological reconstitution of SCID mice infected with Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus might constitute an improved model for the investigation of mechanisms of virus-induced demyelination in man. Infection of highly sensitive suckling SCID mice, either by gavage or by natural transmission from experimentally infected dams, will offer a useful approach for the study of these mechanisms.",
