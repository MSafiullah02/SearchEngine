The Clinical Center is the hospital component of the NIH intramural research program and supports clinical protocols from each of the various NIH institutes. The Clinical Center is a 240-bed hospital and patients are admitted exclusively under clinical research protocols. DLM has been in operation since 1955 shortly after the opening of the Clinical Center and operates in many ways like a routine clinical laboratory supporting patient care, but it has a co-equal mission of supporting clinical research. As a consequence of the latter mission, DLM has developed many unique programs to support this second mission. Some of the operational issues related to funding of DLM, which is provided through an annual Congressional budget, may not be applicable to laboratories that charge a fee for service and are mandated to operate with a net profit; however, many of the other issues that we address will be applicable to clinical laboratories in academic medical centers.",

Members of the senior staff within DLM provide assistance in deciding optimum utilization of existing clinical laboratory tests and the feasibility of developing new diagnostic or other specialized tests to support a research protocol. Guidance often is offered in the selection of preferred tests when multiple tests could possibly be used. Issues related to the frequency of testing often are discussed also in terms of what is feasible for the clinical laboratory to perform, and also based on the likely rate of change of any given laboratory test. The development of a new test, such as a technique to detect a specific analyte or infectious agent, is determined by the feasibility of having an outside laboratory perform the test versus the technical expertise and resources available within DLM. An advantage of new test development initially focused on a research question is the potential for the future integration of this test into the menu offered for routine patient care. The chief of DLM and/or relevant senior staff members also review all newly approved protocols. This provides an opportunity to determine the impact a new protocol may have on clinical laboratory services and also allows another opportunity for the clinical laboratory to provide advice on laboratory testing in clinical protocols.",

            "text": "Most laboratory information systems and/or hospital information systems are suitable for providing a pathway for test ordering within clinical research protocols. However, to accommodate the testing of stored samples obtained previously from research subjects, a procedure was developed for the investigator to order tests in this setting with the inclusion of the collection date and generation of sample identifiers. There are many other issues to consider in the context of how to best integrate research samples into the regular workload of patient samples. A major issue is what tests should be offered in the regular test menu. Over 400 tests are available to be ordered from DLM via the standard hospital information system ordering system at the NIH. All clinical laboratory tests used in routine patient care are available as well as many specialized tests, which often are used to support research objectives. Over 90% of standard laboratory test volume is done within DLM, with the remainder sent out to various reference laboratories primarily based on low frequency of test requests. Testing not presently available as part of our menu that is requested based on an emerging need is handled by consultation with a senior staff member of DLM. When the requested test is used for patient care, it is managed and funded by DLM, but when used primarily for research DLM only assists the researchers in finding an appropriate testing site. Alternatively, under these circumstances DLM may utilize its onsite testing resources to develop new tests as part of a research collaboration between one of the DLM senior staff and the principal investigator. This may involve performing a new test that has become available on an existing analyzer in the laboratory (but currently not offered) or in some cases this may require the development of a new test method within DLM. Tracking specialized test development for research protocols is an important aspect in identifying how the translational research resources of the clinical laboratory are being utilized in support of specific clinical research protocols among various institutes of the NIH.",

The unique aspects of sample collection and processing for clinical research relates to proper management (specific collection devices, temperature management, etc.) and distribution, as well as tracking blood volume associated with research testing. Although this process generally follows the normal pathway of sample collection, a specialized HIS ordering process has been developed specifically for research testing. This system includes options for type and number of collection vessels, specific instructions in terms of handling the sample(s) and contact information for sample pick-up. Because of workload and space constraints, DLM does not provide processing of patient samples obtained exclusively for research lab testing and also does not provide long-term storage for these samples, which is typically managed by the principal investigator. The exception to this approach is found in the microbiology group that manages long-term storage of selected organisms for later use, and this has proven to be an extraordinarily powerful tool in translational projects within microbiology. DLM does have an IRB-approved protocol that allows anonymized leftover samples (i.e., those that are beyond our routine seven-day holding period) to be accessed by the laboratory for new test development or validation, and by the principal investigator for the protocol under which the patient was admitted.",

Problems can arise when patients are admitted to a protocol based on an assay result done by a different clinical laboratory that show poor correlation with the result performed at the study institution. The lack of harmonization of clinical laboratory results is one of the major problems in the field of diagnostic testing.1 Efforts by several international organizations to develop gold standard reference methods and well-characterized standards for calibration will improve this problem in the future. The current situation makes it necessary for clinical laboratorians to understand the strengths and limitations of the various assays they offer and provide guidance to clinical researchers in the interpretation of the results.",

            "text": "The other problem that the lack of test harmonization creates is the difficulty of changing assays before the completion of a protocol. A clinical laboratory may make changes in their assays for a variety of reasons, including replacement of a discontinued assay or improvement in the accuracy, cost effectiveness, or turnaround time with a new assay. The impact of these changes can be minimized, if the substitute assay is chosen so that it closely matches the results of the previous assay. It also is useful to run both assays in parallel for a short period of time to establish a regression equation relating the two assays. Using such an equation, the investigator can convert the results of one assay to the other, to reduce the increased variance from the multiple assays. It also is important to carefully establish the reference interval of the new assay and to interpret the results in the context of this new range when the two assays differ significantly. In the case of tumor markers, which can often show substantial differences between assays, it may be necessary to offer both assays in parallel for an extended period of time until all the patients are \u201cre-baselined\u201d with the new assay. It is critically important to communicate with the primary investigators in the setting of an assay that is undergoing a change so they understand why the assay is being changed and the potential impact of this on their protocols. Finally, when the clinical laboratory supports a Phase I, II or III clinical trial, it has to establish at the outset that the assays it provides meet FDA recommendations.",

In contrast, ELISA kits are available for a much wider variety of tests and thus this is often the preferred format for developing a new test. It may be necessary, however, to have an automated ELISA workstation that is an open platform, if ELISA testing processes a large number of samples. HPLC is also a versatile technique, particularly for small molecules, such as vitamins and drugs, for which there are no commercial assays. Perhaps the most versatile platform is LC-MS, which can be applied for an even wider variety of tests, because of its superb sensitivity and specificity. It also can be used for the measurement of proteins and peptides, without the need for developing an antibody.2 In the last few years, several types of instruments have been developed for multiplex immunoassays,3 such as the MesoScale electrochemiluminscent plate reader and the Luminex bead-based technology, which can simultaneously measure from a few to a large number of different protein analytes on a relatively small sample volume. These types of assays are particularly well suited for clinical protocols that require the measurement of a large number of different cytokines.",

We also have established a long-term data repository of all clinical data, which goes back more than three decades. A common request of investigators when preparing data for publication is details specific to the assay used and its performance characteristics including precision, reference range, and sensitivity.

Likewise, an expanded non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation program at the NIH prompted DLM to develop lineage-specific chimerism testing to meet the need of monitoring the level of donor engraftment among various hematopoietic elements. This has been further refined to meet the specific need of evaluating donor chimerism at the level of cell subpopulations as well as the requirement to monitor donor chimerism in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation based on two different donor cord bloods administered to one recipient.",

This specialized laboratory is not likely to be available in most clinical laboratory settings. However, with the unique mission of the NIH along with specialized research currently ongoing in the area of bioterrorism being conducted locally at the NIH, military laboratories and Homeland Security laboratories, this facility serves a very specialized need in our setting.

Most routine general chemistry tests designed for human specimens will also work on animal samples.14 The same is true for automated complete blood counting, although an adjustment has to be made for some species.14 Immunoassays designed for human samples, however, frequently do not work well on animal samples, a problem that is particularly true for protein immunoassays.",

In many cases, the introduction of a significant number of research samples also will negatively impact on the overall efficiency of the clinical laboratory operation, particularly due to the extra effort and diligence that is necessary to process samples of these types. However, when compared to creating a separate stand-alone laboratory specifically for managing research samples, integrating these samples into the workload of a routine clinical laboratory is generally the most efficient approach.
