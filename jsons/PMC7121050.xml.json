Recently, based on its ultrastructure and ribosomal RNA phylogenetic analysis, pneumocystis is now believed to be a kind of fungus, with high affinity to the lung tissues. Due to the compromised immunity, 95 % AIDS patients sustain different types of pulmonary infections, of which PCP is the most common life-threatening opportunistic infection with an incidence rate of about 60\u201385 %. About 90\u201395 % patients suffering from AIDS complicated by PCP are adolescents and adults with their CD4 T cell counts being less than 200/\u03bcl. Clinical manifestations of typical PCP are fever, cough (dry cough without phlegm), dyspnea, chest distress and shortness of breath. Dyspnea is shown as progressive difficulty in breathing, which initially occurs after physical activities and develops into difficulty breathing even in resting state. PCP is commonly accompanied by weight loss, fatigue, anemia, general upset and lymphadenectasis. All these symptoms are non-specific, but patients often report subjective feelings of severe symptoms while physical signs are mild. By auscultation, the lungs are normal or with slightly dry, moist rales. These are the clinical findings characteristic to AIDS complicated by PCP. In most patients with PCP, the serum LDH level increases but it is non-specific. In cases of AIDS complicated by PCP, the blood PO2 reduces, commonly being lower than 70 mmHg in patients in the middle and advanced stages. The diagnostic imaging for PCP includes chest X-ray and CT scanning. Due to the low resolution of chest X-ray, its demonstrations are negative for PCP patients in the early stage or only include thickened pulmonary markings and decreased pulmonary transparency. However, CT scanning demonstrates tiny lesions or more detailed changes in lungs. Especially with the application of HRCT, the detection rate of PCP lesions has been greatly improved. It has been internationally reported that nearly 10 % of PCP patients show negative findings by the chest X-ray but with abnormal findings by HRCT. Due to the rapid progression of PCP as well as its complex pathological changes, CT scanning demonstrations are diverse with specificity. According to different pulmonary CT scanning demonstrations in different stages of the illness, PCP is divided into early stage (exudative and infiltrative stage), middle stage (fusion and parenchymal stage) and advanced stage (absorption or fibrosis stage). The early typical manifestations include intrapulmonary multiple miliary nodules, mainly distributed in both middle and lower lung fields. It may be accompanied by enlarged hilar shadow, which should be differentiated from acute miliary tuberculosis.",

Cryptococcal infection often manifests as meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Its pulmonary infection is simple or with accompanying meningitis. The clinical manifestations are the fever, cough, shortness of breath and rarely accompanying chest pain. About 10 % patients with cryptococcal infection have respiratory failure. Cryptococcal pneumonia can occur in any part of the lungs, commonly with multiple foci in both lower lungs. Its imaging demonstrations commonly include increased pulmonary markings, singular or multiple nodules and the fusion of multiple nodules into mass. In 1992, Jones et al. [103] divided the pulmonary lesions into four groups: (1) Primary syndrome composed of subpleural lesions and the involved lymph nodes; (2) Granuloma, which is larger parenchymal granuloma; the granuloma contains large quantity inactive yeast and surrounded by fibrous granulation tissues, which contains large quantity macrophages. (3) Intrapulmonary miliary lesions, the lesions being in miliary size and diffusively distributing; (4) Formation of cavities, with central necrosis of the foci to form cavity; 10\u201316 % patients may have thin wall cavities. The manifestations of bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltration, patchy fusion, nodules, pleurisy, and hilar lymphadenectasis have also been reported. There are also some individual reports of cryptococcal pneumonia with pulmonary mass, singular pleural effusion and pneumothorax. In addition, some cases of cryptococcal infection may show negative pulmonary manifestations. The pathological changes include mainly exudative or granulomatous reaction, infiltrations of macrophages, lymphocytes and multinuclear macrophages in the foci, and rarely found purulent lesions. Chronic granuloma may be accompanied with extensive fibrosis.",

In AIDS patients, aspergillus invades the bronchial wall and the lung tissues after inhaled to cause exudative and necrotic lesions as well as secondary suppurative pneumonia and lung abscess. After the pus fluids and necrotic substances expelled, cavity forms. Sometimes a fungus ball occurs in the cavity. Due to the different types of aspergillus as well as their different targets of invasion and different defense mechanism of the human body, the demonstrations of aspergillus pneumonia are also varying, which can be divided into four types. The first type includes bronchial pneumonia, disseminated aspergillus sepsis, aspergillus ball, and allergic reaction, with clinical manifestations of chills, fever, wheezing, cough, mucous sputum, hemoptysis and chest pain. Hemoptysis is a serious symptom of pulmonary aspergillosis, which can be the main reason of death. By chest X-ray, there are pulmonary infiltration and cavity lesion that is a round shadow with clear boundary, movable with posture. In the cases with bronchial occlusion, the fluid in the cavity shows liquid level, and sometimes in air crescent sign, based on which neoplasm can be excluded. Aspergillus infection secondary to the cavity is the specific demonstration for the imaging diagnosis of aspergillosis.",

            "text": "Penicillium marneffei is a new species of penicillium genus, which was discovered in 1956 [104], with a distribution in Southeast Asia and southern China. Rhizomys is its natural host. As an conditional pathogen, people with compromised immunity are susceptible to Penicilliosis marneffei (PSM). Penicillium marneffei can spread through the contaminated soil by faeces of Rhizomys, and infect people via the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract and skin defects. PSM is believed to be one of the most common opportunistic infections in AIDS patients of Southeast Asia, and its incidence is still increasing. The clinical manifestations include long-term fever, progressive weight loss, cough and expectoration, skin rash, anemia, and lymphadenectasis. The pathological process of PM pneumonia is that PM yeast phase pigment with a strong hydrophobicity promotes the conidium of the mould phase and the cells of the yeast phase to adhere to the alveolar macrophages and macrophages in other parts, which enlarge the organs with abundant mononuclear macrophages, such as lymphadenectasis. Macrophagic granuloma may occur, with multinucleated cytomegalic responses. Kudeken et al. [13] conducted a study on PM infected but immunocompetent rats, which demonstrated that PM can cause fatal high inflammatory responses after complex CD4 T cells mediation. But in AIDS patients with PM pulmonary infections, due to the serious insufficiency of the CD4 T cells, the phagocytosis of macrophages is obviously weakened, with less exudative changes but commonly proliferative changes to cause only non-reactive necrotic inflammation with cavity formation. Zhang et al. [105] studies a group of cases, with imaging characteristic demonstrations of clustering cavities in the irregularly thick wall, reflecting its pathological features of mainly proliferation and necrotic cavities. The clustering may be related to the spreading of PM along the bronchi. The pulmonary puncture for biopsy demonstrates that microscopically tissue culture at a temperature of 25 \u00b0C may find mycelium branches and septa as well as the string of microspores or growth of hyphae in broom liked appearance.",

It can parasitize in the mocous of skin, oral cavity, intestinal tract and vagina of the human being. Candida albicans cannot cause disease in immunocompetent people but is pathogenic in immunocompromised population. After its invasion into the tissues, it turns into mycelia and multiplies in large quantity with great toxicity. It also has the ability to fight against phagocytosis. Clinically, its infection is characterized by a chronic onset and clinical symptoms of low and moderate grade fever but rarely high fever, cough, shortness of breath, cyanosis, irritation or dysphoria. The pulmonary signs include weakened breathing sounds by auscultation and obvious moist rales of lungs. The serious cases may have symptoms of systemic poisoning. The illness is prolonged and repeated during its whole progression. By diagnostic imaging demonstrations, it can be divided into the following types: (1) Bronchitis type, with chest X-ray demonstrations of increased pulmonary markings in lower fields of both lungs; (2) Pneumonia type, commonly with accompanying extrapulmonary lesions. The lesions are mainly located in the middle and lower lung fields and lesions in the lower lung field are more common. The apex is generally not involved. The lesions are recurring one after another. A small number of patients may sustain complications of exudative pleurisy. (3) Disseminated type, with miliary shadows, diffuse nodular shadows or multiple small abscesses. The lesions often involve the middle and lower lungs. Chest X-ray demonstrates thickened pulmonary markings and accompanying spots, small flakes and large flakes of parenchyma shadows, in manifestations of bronchial pneumonia. In some serious cases, the foci may fuse together and enlarge to involve the entire lobe. CT scanning demonstrates pulmonary nodules and few have ground glass liked changes of the lungs. Pathological changes include acute inflammatory lesions in the lungs, alveolar exudation and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Acute disseminated lesions often cause multiple small abscesses, central caseous necrosis, spores and hyphae in and around the lesions.",

It is often isolated from the soil with abundant contents of birds or bats faeces and spreads along with chickens, birds, dogs, cats, and mice. When the conidia and mycelial fragments of histoplasmosis are inhaled, most can be expelled by the defense mechanism of the human body. Granulomas may form, but in immunocompromised patients, it may cause disseminated histoplasmosis. When the CD4 T cell count in AIDS patients is less than 150/\u03bcl, histoplasma capsulatum infection of lungs may occur. Histoplasma capsulatum pneumonia has a higher incidence in South America, Africa and India. In the slight cases, the clinical manifestations are similar to symptoms of the cold, with low-grade fever, cough, and general upset. In the serious cases, there are symptoms of influenza, including chills, high fever, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue and poor appetite. In the cases of acute cavity, thin-walled cavity may form within a month. Complications may be pericarditis, arthritis, skin nodules, rash fibrous mediastinitis and mediastinal granuloma. Diagnostic imaging demonstrations are non-specific, with scattering pulmonary acinus exudation, multiple nodules in a diameter of about 3 mm with accompanying thickened septa, and formation of granulomas with accompanying calcification.

The WHO reported that there are 88,000 newly infected patients of TB each year and 8.4 % of them are caused by AIDS. It is estimated that each year in 1,000 HIV infected patients, 35\u2013162 sustain active TB, and there is a great risk of active TB progressed from the latent tuberculosis infection. HIV infected patients with tuberculosis are commonly young and middle aged adults, with more male patients than female patients. Tuberculosis can occur at any stage of AIDS and at any level of CD4 T cell counts. It has been internationally reported that HIV infection complicated by TB has no specific imaging demonstrations. It has an acute onset, with an incidence of acute onset 2.5 times as high as that in non-HIV infected patients. The lesions are morphologically diverse, which are different from non-HIV infected patients with TB. HIV infection complicated by TB has commonly an acute onset, while TB in non-HIV infected patients is commonly secondary to other lesions, with cavities, fibrosis, pleural thickening and calcification. A study conducted in China has demonstrated that for AIDS complicated by TB, the acute cases mainly have military and exudative lesions, with an incidence of 33 and 49 % respectively; while the incidence of chronic cases including cavity, fibrosis and calcification is declining, being 11, 11 and 2 respectively. A later occurrence of tuberculosis in HIV infected patients indicates a more seriously immunocompromised immunity, with less typical clinical manifestations and imaging demonstrations. When the CD4 T cell count level is above 350\u2013400/\u03bcl, the systemic symptoms are fever, chills, night sweating, fatigue, poor appetite and weight loss. Respiratory symptoms are cough, expectoration, hemoptysis, chest pain and dyspnea. It manifests as primary tuberculosis, with its foci distributing in the middle and lower lungs, involving multiple lobes and segments. When the CD4 T cell count decrease, the impact of TB increase including the occurrence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and disseminated disease. When the CD4 T cell count drops below 200/\u03bcl, pulmonary tuberculosis manifests as acute onset (such as miliary tuberculosis) or extrapulmonary tuberculosis (such as ileocecal tuberculosis) and peripheral lymph nodes tuberculosis. Its difference from the clinical manifestations of non-HIV infected patients is as the following: (1) More common pulmonary infiltration with multiple involvements and rare cavities; (2) Higher incidence of dissemination (87\u201396 %) commonly along with blood flow and higher incidence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (60\u201370 %); (3) More common lymph node tuberculosis, such as hilar, mediastinal and extrapleural lymphadenectasis; (4) Lower positive rate of tuberculin test (PPD); (5) More patients with no expectoration, with sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli staining is negative; (6) Higher incidence of resistant strains, high recurrence rate, and higher mortality (Table 17.1).\n",

The incidence rate of bacterial pneumonia (BP) is 3\u20135 %. BP has a larger range of impact on HIV infected patients than on non-HIV infected groups. Repeated episode of BP is considered to be the first manifestations of latent HIV infection. Therefore, for those individuals who have recurrent pneumonia without other risk factors, they should be alert to HIV infection. The common pathogenic bacteria include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodococcus equi, Haemophilus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. As non-HIV infected patients, the most common pathogens of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Legionella and Klebsiella are also common. Many factors, such as the reduced T lymphocytes in HIV infected patients, manufacturing disorders of neutrophils, mononuclear cells and cytokines, and dysfunctional B lymphocytes, provide chances for opportunistic bacterial infections. In addition, the application of broad-spectrum antibiotics also increases the chance of opportunistic infections. BP can occur in any stage of HIV and at any level of CD4 T cell count. When the CD4 T cell count decreases, the incidence of BP also increases. The clinical manifestations of HIV infected patients are the same as non-HIV infected patients, with acute onset (3\u20135 days), high fever (39\u201340 \u00b0C), chills, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, purulent sputum (bloody or rusty).

After structure analysis of the cell wall, it was found to be different from Corynebacterium, and therefore it is classified into Rhodococcus. Rhodococcus equi is generally considered as the pathogens of horses, pigs and cattle. Human rhodococcus equi infection is rare. But in recent years, due to an increase in patients with immunodeficiency syndrome, reports of rhodococcus equi induced human respiratory infection and sepsis are increasing. Rhodococcus equi is an intracellular facultative parasitic bacterium. Its optimum temperature for growth is 30 \u00b0C, and suitable temperature for its growth is 10\u201340 \u00b0C. The acid-fast staining for rhodococcus equi shows uncertain results. Due to its various morphology, it is commonly mistaken as diphtheroids bacilli, Bacillus or Micrococcus. On sheep blood agar plate, the bacterium can have synergistic hemolysis with staphylococcus aureus, mononuclear Listeria and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Toxicity mechanisms of Rhodococcus equi has been recently discovered the existence of toxic plasmid, which provides a new idea for the full understanding of its pathogenesis. Clinical symptoms are usually cough, orange red sputum, high fever and other symptoms. E Marchiori et al. in 2005 studied five cases of AIDS complicated by Rhodococcus equi pulmonary infection. All the patients had a case history of cough and fever history for 1\u20132 months with accompanying shortness of breath and chest pain. Li et al. in 2009 [106] studied a group of 13 cases. All patients had fever, with a body temperature being 38\u201340 \u00b0C, cough, orange red sputum. The typical clinical manifestations of the disease are fever, dyspnea and chest pain. Other symptoms such as weight loss, diarrhea and joint pain are not representative. Based on the course of the disease, the diagnostic imaging demonstrations of Rhodococcus equi pulmonary infection can be divided into early stage, showing round liked flaky blurry shadows surrounding unilateral hilum that has blurry boundary; middle stage (parenchymal change), showing central sphere liked high density shadow surrounding unilateral hilum, in parenchymal changes and with clear boundary; advanced stage (necrosis) showing secondary cavity of the pulmonary mass, possibly with hydropneumothorax and pleurisy. The imaging demonstrations are characteristic, but lack of specificity. And it should be differentiated from pulmonary tumors. The pathological changes include the most commonly chronic suppurative bronchopneumonia and extensive pulmonary abscesses. The histopathology demonstrates massive bleeding in alveolar space, large quantity erythrocytes, intact cellular wall and large quantity epithelial cells. The predominant pathological changes may also be fibroblasts, with parenchymal changes of lung tissue and thickened alveolar septa.

Moskowitz et al. [32] reported that among the direct causes of death in AIDS patients, 19 % is due to pulmonary cytomegalovirus infection. Because of the lack of typical clinical manifestations and sensitive examinations for its early diagnosis, the definitive diagnosis rate of cytomegalovirus pneumonia is only 13\u201324 % before autopsy. The clinical manifestations of CMV infection are non-specific. The systemic symptoms are fever, soreness of joints and muscles. Respiratory symptoms are paroxysmal dry cough, progressive shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing during activities. Pulmonary CMV infection may develop secondary fungal infection or be complicated by bacterial, fungal, and Pneumocystis carinii infections. The cytomegalovirus can widely spread in the organs and tissues of the infected patients, and the infections can directly lead to the damage of infected host cells. In addition, the virus can also cause pathogenic effects via immune pathological mechanism. Some scholars classified CMV pneumonia into diffuse, miliary necrosis and cytomegalic. Diffuse and cytomegalic CMV pneumonia are often accompanied by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which is more common in the diffuse type of CMV pneumonia but less common in cytomegalic type of CMV pneumonia. The pathological basis of diffuse small nodules in lungs is hemorrhagic necrosis. Sometimes CMV infection is concurrent with other infections in the lungs, and even co-infects one cell. Pulmonary parenchymal changes indicate bacterial and fungal infections, such as findings of inclusion bodies in the cells, commonly known as Eagle\u2019s Eye sign. The imaging demonstrations of cytomegalovirus pneumonia are diverse. Some studies summarize that the lungs commonly have manifestations of diffuse interstitial infiltration or alveolar infiltration, with ground glass liked changes, pulmonary parenchymal changes, grid liked changes, thickend bronchial wall, bronchiectasis, pulmonary nodules or masses. The principal changes include the early lesions of ground glass liked changes and advanced lesions of pulmonary masses.",

The lungs are the major target of invasion. The diagnostic imaging demonstrates hilar lymphadenectasis and its surrounding nodular infiltration, bilateral interstitial changes, and pleural effusion that are its typical X-ray demonstration. Early pathological changes are similar to those of common angioma; with gathering of capillaries into groups containing histocytes engulfed hemosiderin and orderly arranged vascular endothelial cells. It further progression see active proliferation of endothelial cells and fibroblasts, increased nuclear mitosis with anaplasia, and scattered lymphocytes and histocytes between blood vessels. In the advanced stage, occlusion and necrosis of the vascular lumen can be found.

Lipid can cause the infiltration of human monocytes, epithelial cells and lymphocytes to form tuberculous nodules.

It has been estimated that there are globally about 42 million HIV infected patients, of which more than 25 % sustains active tuberculosis. Most of these patients are in Africa and some developing countries of Asia, with insufficient health care resources. The clinical manifestations of tuberculosis in AIDS patients are affected by the degree of immunosuppression. The imaging findings in the cases with slight immunosuppression are similar to those of secondary tuberculosis in healthy hosts. The disease mainly involves the posterior apical segment of the upper lobe to show focal parenchymal areas and nodular shadows. About 20 % patients may have cavities and 10 % patients may have lymphadenectasis. The imaging demonstrations in the cases with serious immunosuppression are similar to those in the cases with primary tuberculosis, with characteristic abnormal manifestations of hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenectasis and parenchymal changes of the air chambers. CT scanning demonstrates enlarged nodules with low density. Enhanced scanning demonstrates marginal enhancement of the lymph nodes. The incidence of military tuberculosis in AIDS patients is increasing due to reduced thymic T lymphocytes in AIDS patients and the defects of delayed allergic responses, which result in the formation of granulomas and impaired functions to kill bacilli and confine the lesions.",

            "text": "Rhodococcus equi was firstly discovered in 1923 and was nominated as corynebacterium equi. After structure analysis of the cell wall, it was found that the bacterium is quite different from Corynebacterium, and therefore classified as Rhodococcus. Rhodococcus equi is generally believed to be the pathogen for horses, pigs and cattle. Human Rhodococcus equi infection is rare. But in recent years, due to an increase of patients with immunodeficiency syndrome, reports on human respiratory tract infection and sepsis caused by Rhodococcus equi are increasing. In sheep blood agar, Rhodococcus equi may have synergistic hemolysis with staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, which is characteristically rhodococcus equi. Studies by E Marchiori et al. [30] in 2005 revealed that all the 5 cases of AIDS complicated by Rhodococcus equi pulmonary infection have cough and fever lasting for 1\u20132 months, with accompanying shortness of breath and chest pain. All the 13 cases, studied by Li et al. in 2009 [106], have fever with a body temperature of 38\u201340 \u00b0C and cough. There are symptoms or signs of orange red sputum in 10 cases, hemoptysis in 4 cases, dyspnea in 11 cases, lung moist rales in 13 cases, emaciation in 6 cases, poor appetite in 6 cases, diarrhea in 2 cases, joint pain in 1 case, oral candidal infections in 13 cases, oral herpes in 4 cases, chest pain in 4 cases, no obvious symptoms in 1 case and hepatitis B in 3 cases. In the studies of the horse infected with Rhodococcus equi, Professor CHEN [108] found that it is characterized by chest X-ray demonstrations of abscesses in different sizes in the lungs and significant alveolar fusion in the lesion site. Its basic pathological changes are chronic suppurative bronchopneumonia and extensive pulmonary abscesses. The imaging demonstrations are commonly subacute pneumonia, often with cavities. Among the 13 cases of AIDS patients, studied by Li et al. in 2009 [106], 9 cases have central type sphere liked shadows with increased density distributed in the unilateral hilar region, accounting for 70 %. The largest shadow is in size of 5 \u00d7 6 cm, which is centrally dense and peripherally blurry, in a halo sign. The imaging findings are similar to those of lung tumor; with exudative infiltration and large flaky or sphere shaped mass shadow in the right hilar region in 4 cases, infiltration and large patchy or sphere shaped mass shadow in the outer zone of the right lung in 1 case, exudative infiltration and large flaky or sphere shaped mass shadow in left hilar region in 4 cases, diffuse atelectasis in the left lung in 1 cases, partial atelectasis in 5 cases, singular pulmonary abscess cavity in 9 cases, multiple honeycomb liked cavity in 1 case, cavity shadow in the right lung in 6 cases, complicated by fluid level in 4 cases, cavity in the left lung in 3 cases, complicated by fluid level in 1 case, flakey shadows in bilateral hilar regions in 1 case, left pleural effusion in 3 cases and mediastinal lymphadenectasis in 2 cases. Exudative inflammation often occurs around the abscess cavity, possibly with small quantity pleural effusion and/or thickened and adhesive pleura. In the study of 5 cases AIDS complicated by pulmonary Rhodococcus equi infection, conducted by E Marchiori et al. [30] in 2005, CT scanning demonstrates 3 cases with fusion of centrilobular nodules and tree buds sign around the parenchymal changes, among which one case has the lesions in the both lower lobes. Donisi investigated 12 patients with HIV positive complicated by Rhodococcus equi infection and found its mortality rate is 58 % [37]. Harvey reported 11 cases of HIV positive complicated by Rhodococcus equi infection, with 6 cases of death, accounting for 54.5 % [38]. The study of 13 cases of AIDS complicated by Rhodococcus equi infection, conducted by Li et al. [106] found its mortality rate of 7 %. The very different mortality of the two groups may be closely related to the regional economic and medical conditions as well as the administration of antibacterial and HAART therapies. In the study of the AIDS complicated by Rhodococcus equi pulmonary infection, conducted by E Marchiori et al. in 2005 [30], the CD4 T cell count is below 50/\u03bcl. In the study of AIDS complicated by Rhodococcus equi pulmonary infection conducted by Donisi et al. in 1996 [37], CD4 T cell count is 47.7/\u03bcl. The 13 cases of AIDS complicated by Rhodococcus equi infection studied by Li et al. in 2009 [106] showed a CT4 T cell count of lower than 49/\u03bcl. All the results are in consistency. In conclusion, AIDS complicated by pulmonary Rhodococcus equi infection is mainly subacute inflammation. There are exudation around the unilateral hilum as well as centrally dense and peripherally blurry sphere shaped mass shadows, with secondary cavities and parenchyma changes and even pleural effusion. All of these are characteristic imaging demonstrations.",

            "text": "Aspergillus commonly violates bronchus and lung, with involvements of rhinal sinuses, external auditory canal, eye and skin. Otherwise, it disseminates to organs of the body along with blood flow. The early lesions are diffuse infiltrative and exudative changes. And advanced lesions are necrosis, pyogenesis or granuloma. Large quantity hyphae can be found in the lesions. The hyphae penetrate the blood vessels to cause vasculitis, perivascular inflammation and thrombosis. And thrombosis can cause ischemia and necrosis of the tissue. According to the pathological changes and imaging findings, it can be divided into three major types: vascular invasion type, bronchopneumonia type and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis type. (1) The vascular invasion type is the result caused by toxins released in the process of aspergillus spreading extensively from the primary focus to the lungs. Vascular infiltration of the pulmonary parenchyma and coagulative necrosis are believed to be the cause of vascular occlusion and pulmonary infarction. (2) Bronchopneumonia type is acute bronchitis caused by inhalation of Aspergillus spores. In the cases of hyphae invasion into the lung tissues, extensive infiltrative pneumonia or focal granuloma are resulted in. It can also cause necrosis, pyogenesis and multiple small abscesses. Spherical pulmonary aspergillosis is often secondary to bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, carcinous cavity and other lung diseases. Mycelia multiply and gather in the cavities of the lungs to form a spherical mass with fibrin and mucosal cells, which are called aspergillar glomera, which do not invade the lung tissue. (3) Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis type is the proliferation and germination of inhaled Aspergillus spore in the airway, often showing obvious related mucosal lesions and eventually resulting in bronchiectasis (Fig. 17.64a\u2013c).\n\n",

The infection is often caused by inhaled aspergillus fumigatus in the environment. Vascular invasion type of pulmonary aspergillosis usually has multiple lesions and nodular changes. Generally in pathology, the center of nodule presents typical pale color; commonly with fibrous ring surrounding the nodules resulted from hemorrhage and/or lung parenchymal changes. Histologically, they are characterized by coagulative necrosis of the lung tissues, infiltration of large quantity hyphae in the necrotic tissue, pulmonary vascular infiltration, but usually without responses of vasculitis and thrombosis. The enzymes released by neutrophile granulocytes can cause the separation of necrotic tissue from its adjacent lung tissues to form necrotic mass in the cavities. Airway invasion type of pulmonary aspergillosis, also called aspergillus bronchopneumonia, accounts for 15\u201330 % of invasive aspergillosis. The most common imaging findings are unilateral/bilateral flaky parenchymal changes, centrilobular small nodules and branches liked linear shadows (tree buds sign). Histologically, it is characterized by necrosis and infiltration of neutrophil granulocytes. The lesions surround the bronchiole and the bronchiole. The invasion of the pulmonary artery can cause bleeding of the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis rarely has lesions, with no unknown pathogenesis, which is generally believed to be related to type I and type II allergic reactions. It usually shows obvious asthma related mucosal lesions. Hyphae generated by aspergillus fumigatus can induce the production of mucus and additional mucosal lesions, eventually leading to bronchiectasis. Dilatate bronchial lumen is filled with mucus or with absence of epithelium, which is replaced by a granulomatous inflammatory infiltration. The most common imaging manifestations are migratory flocculent, branched Y shaped and V shaped (fingertip sign) shadows in the pulmonary parenchyma, which are related to the infiltration of eosinophils. Pathologically, bronchial cystic dilatation in the pulmonary segment and sub-segment occurs, with large quantity eosinophils in the bronchial mucus and scattered broken aspergillus hyphae. In combination with the case history, the diagnosis can be defined.",

In immunocompetent patients, the nodular granuloma caused by the pathogen is similar to those of other pulmonary fungal infections. In patients with serious immunosuppression, wide tissue infiltration of the pathogens may occur in the lungs. A series of imaging demonstrations of pulmonary cryptococcus infection includes reticular or reticulated nodular interstitium. Other less common demonstrations are ground-glass liked shadows, parenchymal changes of air cavity and miliary nodules. The pathogenic fungi can be found mainly in the pulmonary interstitium. Imaging findings include singular or multiple nodules or masses, parenchymal changes of lung lobes and lung segments with clear or unclear boundaries in size of 1\u201310 cm.

At different culture temperatures, it shows conversion of biphasic forms: fungal phase at 25 \u00b0C and yeast phase at 37 \u00b0C. The fungal phase is the hyphae of many cells, with certain biological morphology, such as penicillus, conidiophore, chain liked conidiospore and chains between spores. The yeast phase shows unicellular or bicellular form. In the growth process of PM, large quantity bright rosy or dark rosy pigments are produced, which is characteristically PM. The pigment of yeast phase is secondary metabolites of cells with strong hydrophobicity, which can promote the adhesion of conidiums in fungal phase and cells in yeast phase to the alveolar macrophages and other cells surface in the human body. The pigment monoclonal antibody (MAb) can interrupt the pathological process of adhesion. In addition, this pigment can determine the expression of cluster-encoding genes Mbr through diffusion and penetration of drugs to the cell membrane, thus preventing the penetration of hydrophilic antifungal drugs, such as fluconazole. That is to say, it improves the natural antifungal resistance level of PM. The soluble components of the pigment in fungal phase can trigger the generation of anti-conidium antibody (only IgG) in animals to prevent its spreading in the body. The phenomenon proves that, in terms of tissue invasion, fungal phase is less powerful than yeast phase. Conidium in fungal phase is the carrier of pathogen while the cells in yeast phase are the real pathogenic factors.",

Vascular reactions and exudation of neutrophil leukocytes and body fluids is less than abscesses induced by common purulent bacteria. The clinical manifestation is confined suppurative inflammation.

The thickness of the nucleocapsid is about 100 nm, which is composed of 162 capsomeres. The nucleocapsid contains the core of the virus DNA. The virion gains the phospholipid rich viral envelope when it passes through the nuclear envelope. The nucleocapsid gemmates after it passes through the nuclear membrane and is released to the cell surface. The nucleocapsid can also be released outside the cells or gains its access into the neighbour cells for further reproduction. Herpes simplex virus replicates itself in the cell nucleus to produce histopathologic changes of herpes virus replication, with visible Cowdry A type intranuclear inclusions. The pathogenesis process of herpes simplex virus infection in the body can be divided into five stages: initial skin mucosa infection, acute ganglia infection, latent infections, re-activation, and recurrent infections in susceptible hosts. Patients infected by herpes simplex virus can produce IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies to fight directly against virus protein, which may play a role in changing the severity of the infection. Interferon also participates in the control of herpes simplex infection by inhibiting the virus or regulating the defense mechanism. Genetic factors may be also related to the herpes virus infection. Cellular immunity can confine the infection. Herpes virus cannot reproduce in the alveolar macrophages of human body, which is also the reason why herpes virus is less than cytomegalovirus in lungs. Currently, it is believed that herpes simplex virus is an important pathogen of respiratory infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Localized herpes simplex viral pneumonia occurs due to the direct spreading of virus in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Diffuse herpes simplex viral pneumonia is caused by the virus spread from the reproductive organs lesions or oral lesions (most possibly blood borne).

The vast majority of them have the morphology of the B cells, and most are related to Epstein-Barr viral genome. Its occurrence is at a CD4 T cell count being lower than 100/\u03bcl. Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma tend to occur in the early stage of AIDS, with a CD4 T cell count being above 200/\u03bcl. The most common imaging demonstrations include singular or multiple nodules. The singular lesions have a scattering distribution, with clear boundaries. The smooth nodules should be diagnosed as HIV/AIDS related lymphoma. The larger mass sometimes may have cavities in it. Interstitial infiltration with no masses or nodules is rare. Another rare manifestation of HIV/AIDS related B cell lymphoma is pleural, pericardial or abdominal cavity effusion without scattered masses, which is known as coelom-derived or primary exudative lymphoma.",

Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma can be found in any stage of HIV infection, which may occur at even normal level of CD4 T cell count. However, it mostly occurs at a CD4 T cell count being lower than 2,200 \u00d7 106/L. The results of epidemiological studies and the fact of HHV-8 being isolated from Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma tissues have demonstrated that Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma is closely related to HHV-8 infection. As a result, HHV-8 is known as Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma related herpes virus. In patients with HIV/AIDS related Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, its serologic positive rate is 100 %. Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma cells can produce IL-6, during which IL-6 plays a role as an autocrine factor to maintain the cell growth, paracrine cytokines, stimulate proliferation of other interstitial cells and induct the vascular growth. Therefore, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma is a kind of tumor with abundant blood vessels. Before the application of HARRT, the incidence of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma in male homosexuals is 21 %. After the clinical application of HARRT treatment, the incidence is decreasing. In addition to HHV-8, some studies indicated that most patients with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma have HIA-DR5 alleles, suggesting a possible relationship between Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and the heredity.",

Early pathological manifestations are chronic inflammation or granulomatous inflammation, with formation of new vascular and lymphatic vessels and accompanying edema and bleeding. The findings of large and protruding endothelial cells in granuloma tissue with accompanying erythrocytic exudation and hemosiderin particles have great significance for the early diagnosis. The pathological changes in the advanced stage are significant proliferation of the endothelial cells, and proliferation of fibroblasts around capillaries. In the advanced stage, the lesions are often accompanied by extensive connective tissue hyperplasia, which presents difficulty for its differentiation from common sarcoma. When it is difficult to define the diagnosis by light microscopy, immunohistochemical examinations can be used to define the diagnosis. The pathological changes are characterized by lesions confined to the epithelial lamina propria, gathering of spindle cells with mild heteromorphism around many lacuna vasorum with irregular lumen, erythrocytic exudation and hemosiderin sedimentation. The atypical lacuna vasorum can be compressed by proliferative spindle cells to be absent. Vascular endothelial cells and peripheral spindle cells may have mitotic phase in the advanced stage, with increased heteromorphism cells. The inflammatory cells are mainly plasma cells, with acidophilic corpuscles and PAS staining positive, which can assist the pathological diagnosis.",

CT scanning demonstrations include mass shadows intruding into the bronchial lumen, irregular and thickened bronchial wall, and stenosis or obstruction of bronchial lumen. The cases of peripheral type lung cancer have manifestations of nodular or mass shadows around the lung fields, lobulation or incisura with fine and short spikes. The cases of diffuse bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma have manifestations of infiltrative pathological changes, diffuse scattered nodules and small flake shadows, fusion of them into large flaky shadows, similar to those of pneumonia. CT scanning with high resolution can define early lung cancer. Enhanced scanning can define hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis. MR imaging is less favorable in demonstrating lesions in the lung parenchyma than CT scanning. Molecular imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography (18FDG-PET-CT) can demonstrate the increased and thick stained metabolites.\n",
