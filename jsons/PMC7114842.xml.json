For a very small number of pathogens that are truly transmissible via the airborne route, or where aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) involving infectious body fluids are being undertaken, a respirator will be required.

Inward leakage can result from penetration through the material matrix of the face piece or through any gap between the face piece and the wearer's face (see Appendix 1 \u2018fit testing\u2019). FFP3 offers the highest level of protection. Although most of the evidence base supporting the use of FFP respirators in the prevention of airborne transmission of infection is based upon N95/FFP2 devices, FFP3 is the only FFP class acceptable to HSE for use against infectious aerosols in health care in the UK (Appendix 3). In the USA, N95 (approximately equivalent to FFP2) is acceptable, as is the case in a number of other countries.",

However, the degree of protection offered by immunization against different agents is variable, and the durability of protection may wane over time.
