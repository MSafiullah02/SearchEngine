(2) Diploid cell strain, being limited within about 50 generations, can be applied for laboratory use. But the cells may be subjected to aging and death after several generations.

Hatest or immunological assays may be applied to examine proliferation of the virus. Negative findings in CPE or other laboratory tests may be induced by small quantity of viruses in the specimen that is undetectable even if proliferation of the virus does occur.

One type is applied to detect and localize the antigen or antibody in tissues and cells, which is known as immunohistochemistry or immunoenzymatic staining. The other type is applied to detect soluble antigen or antibody in various body fluids, which is known as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA). After preparation of specimen, immunoenzymatic staining is performed with the following procedures: inhibition of the endogenous enzymes and the following immunoenzymatic staining for examination. Its basic principle and procedures are the same as those of fluorescence antibody method, only with enzyme to replace fluorescein as the marker and emergence of colored substances in the substrate as positive. Routine immunoenzymatic staining can be further categorized in to direct and indirect staining. Direct staining is performed to label specific antibody with enzyme for direct detection of parasite or its antigen. After fixation of the specimen containing parasite or its antigen, the inside endogenous enzymes are firstly inhibited. After that, enzyme labelled antibody is directly added for its binding to the antigen in the specimen, followed by addition of substrate for coloration and microscopic examination. Indirect staining is performed by processing of the tissues or cells containing parasite or its antigen with specific antibody for binding of the antigen to the antibody. The unbinding components are cleansed and eliminated, followed by addition of enzyme labelled antibody for formation of antigen-antibody-enzyme-labeled-antibody complex. Finally, the substrate is added for coloration and microscopic examination. Although with additional one step, the indirect staining shows higher specificity and has gained wider application. The second enzyme labelled antibody can be replaced by staphylococcal protein A (SPA) or biotin-avidin system, which has also be successfully applied to detect many antigens and antibodys. Meanwhile, both specificity and sensitivity of the staining have been increased by varying degrees. ELIZA can be further categorized into solid-phase ELISA and homogeneous ELISA. Solid-phase ELISA is to chemically or physically link antigen or antibody to a solid phase carrier to prepare an immunosorbent for immunoenzymatic assay. ELIZA is the most widely used solid phase immunoenzymatic assay. Homogeneous ELISA is applied to directly detect antigen or antibody in the solution with no isolation of the free enzyme marker from the binding enzyme marker and no use of solid phase carrier.

The principle of glutaraldehyde labeling is the covalent binding of its aldehyde group to amidogen of immunoglobulin. Namely, one of the two active aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde binds to amidogen of enzyme molecules, while the other binds to amidogen of immunoglobulin to form enzyme-glutaraldehyde-immunoglobulin complex. Sodium periodate labeling is mainly used to label HRP. Its advantages include high labeling rate and small quantity of unlabeled antibody.

Thus the ribosome can successfully remain on 3\u2032 terminal of mRNA to connect protein and mRNA together. PCR extension is commonly performed for several times during transformation of gene fragment.The necessary gene fragments and intervening sequences are amplified respectively.Primer 4 and Primer 5 are used for connecting PCR to connect target gene and introns. Primer 5 contains SD sequence and Primer 4 contains 3\u2032 terminal stem-loop structure sequence.The PCR product undergoes PCR extension again, with Primer 6 containing T7 initiator sequence and 5\u2032 terminal stem-loop structure sequence as well as the same downstream product. The 5\u2032 terminal is connected with T7 initiator, stem-loop structure and SD sequence, while 3\u2032 terminal integrates with intervening sequences and contains 3\u2032 terminal stem-loop structure.\n",

For instances, in addition to the mesenteric vein, schistosome may also grow in lungs, brain and other body parts to cause ectopic damages; protozoa parasitizing in blood or blood cells may spread to any part of human body along with blood flow to cause multiple organ damages or systematic extensive lesions, such protozoa as plasmodium, Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma; parasites residing in the intestinal tract generally are confined to the digestive system to cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but the larvae of a notable proportion of intestinal nematodes may migrate inside the body via the blood flow, such as roundworm, hookworm and strongyloides stercoralis.

The parasite examinations are generally categorized into etiological examination, immunoassay and molecular biological examination, all of them have diverse specific methods and are of different values in identifying different species of parasite. For helminthic infections, successful detection of eggs, larva and/or imago in various clinical specimens, especially intestinal specimens, can define the diagnosis. For instances, by direct stool smearing or microscopic observation, the finding of roundworm, whipworm and hookworm eggs can define the diagnosis. As for the protozoa, because their polypides are minute ranging from only 1.5 \u03bcm (microsporidia) to 80 \u03bcm (balantidium coli), and some even grow within cells, the definitive diagnosis requires smearing and staining, or even special staining. For some parasites, the species can be defined by biochemical and molecular biological techniques. For instances, plasmodium infection can be defined by microscopic examination after blood collection, blood smearing and staining. As for the microsporidia, a definitive diagnosis requires electronic microscopy or molecular biological examination such as PCR. Different approaches in examining the same specimen show different sensitivity and specificity to the polypide.
