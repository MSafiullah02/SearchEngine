This technique has also frequently been referred to by various other names, including gel-permeation , gel-exclusion , size-exclusion , and molecular-sieve chromatography. The basic principle of gel fi ltration is quite straightforward. Molecules are partitioned between a mobile phase and a stationary phase (comprising a porous matrix of defi ned porosity) as a function of their relative sizes. A column constructed of such a matrix, typically in bead form, will have two measurable liquid volumes, the external volume, consisting of the liquid between the beads, and the internal volume, consisting of the liquid within the beads. The external volume is usually referred to as the void volume ( V 0 ), while the sum of the external and internal volumes is the total volume ( V t ). Following sample application, molecules larger than the pores of the stationary phase matrix will be excluded from the internal volume within the beads and will, therefore, migrate quite rapidly through the column, emerging at V 0 , while molecules both smaller than the matrix pores, as well as those intermediate in size, will equilibrate with both the external and internal liquid volumes, causing them to migrate much more slowly and emerge at a volume ( V e ) greater than V 0 . Molecules are, therefore, eluted in order of decreasing molecular size. The elution volume, V e , of a particular molecule depends on the fraction of the stationary phase available to it for diffusion. This can be represented by the constant K d or K av (also referred to as the partition coeffi cient ).

This is defi ned as the diameter of the spherical volume (hydrodynamic volume) created by a molecule as it rapidly tumbles in solution. When performing gel-fi ltration chromatography, one generally assumes that all of the molecules within a mixture have the same symmetrical shape, so that the order of elution will be one of decreasing molecular weight. Whereas this is an acceptable assumption in most cases, one must bear in mind that the operative molecule dimension during gel fi ltration is the hydrodynamic volume and, as such, an asymmetrical molecule will appear to elute with an abnormally high molecular weight compared with a symmetrical molecule of similar molecular mass. When separating out proteins, for example, the usual assumption is that all of the proteins in the mixture are globular.

Each of these materials has advantages and disadvantages. Dextran may be greatly improved as a support material by means of enhanced cross-linking and its \"swelling\" may be controlled by the surrounding ionic milieu. With agarose, this \"swelling\" is nearly independent of ionic strength and pH but high binding capacities may be obtained with synthesis of highly porous agarose particles. Polyacrylamide-based matrices have a swelling behavior similar to dextrans while cellulose has a hydrophilic surface (which is good for reducing nonspecifi c hydrophobic interactions ). Although cellulose is relatively inexpensive, it requires extra crosslinking for stability. Acrylate-copolymer supports are stable across a wide range of pH values.

They are also stable to repeated autoclaving and to exposure to abrasive chemicals and detergents (such as SDS, urea, and guanidine hydrochloride). These types of media are typically available both as small beads, which are optimal for micropreparative and analytical runs, as well as larger beads which are more suitable for larger scale preparative work. The high rigidity of the Superdex media allows for viscous eluents to be run at relatively high fl ow rates . Nonspecifi c interactions are negligible when using buffers with ionic strengths in the range 0.15-1.5 M.

Silica gel, made from sodium silicate, is a granular, vitreous, porous mineral that can be processed into either granular or beaded form.

As a chromatographic material, silica has the advantage that it has a larger pore volume and narrower pore size distribution. Hence, it often gives sharper peaks and better resolution in certain cases. However, larger pore size silica particles may be brittle and fragile, and subject to collapse at high pressures. In addition, only a limited range of pH values may be utilized with these media. Because silica dissolves quite readily above pH values of 7-8, it is not possible to exceed pH 7.5 in eluents used with silica columns. In general, silica has been found to give the best results for the separation of small proteins, ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 Da.
