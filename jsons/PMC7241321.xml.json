There are approximately 7.2 million horses in the United States (US) of America and humans associated with these animals make up a large and economically diverse industry that contributes significantly to the US economy [5]. However, the vitality of the equine industry also depends on the health and wellness of those animals, and therefore keeping the equine industry accurately informed during a disease outbreak is imperative. For example, equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) is a widespread, viral pathogen that can manifest as respiratory disease, abortion, or myeloencephalopathy, and therefore poses a major economic threat to the equine industry worldwide [6]. In the Netherlands, when the media hype around 4 minor cases of EHV-1-associated myeloencephalopathy (EHM) became a social media-fueled frenzy, the resulting cancellation of competitions and a \u201cvoluntary\u201d standstill of all equine activity had a significant economic impact [7].",

Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), on the other hand, is a viral disease spread by black flies and other insect vectors that cause infection in equids, ruminants, swine, and New World camelids; infection results in vesicular lesions that rapidly progress to ulcerative lesions [9]. While VSV is rarely life-threatening to horses or cattle, the quarantine imposed to limit the spread of the disease and the economic impact of the disease is felt within the equine industry at many levels [10]. The 2014 VS outbreak was the worst VS outbreak in the US since 2005, with 490 VSV-affected premises in 8 states, and 370 of those in Colorado [10]. Unfortunately, these numbers were exceeded in 2019, with 1,140 VSV-affected premises again across 8 states, with more than half of the affected premises in Colorado [11].",

Extension agents are often a critical centerpiece for dissemination of knowledge in the community [13] and animal disease emergency preparedness plans articulate the use of both Extension and non-governmental veterinarians to facilitate communication and implementation of government-organized disease management strategies [14]. As the affective aspects of information seeking behavior change from everyday use to a crisis event [15], it is critical to recognize that crisis communications are unique in that they include the dialogue that occurs between an organization, including its acting agents, and its public prior to, during, and after the \u201ccrisis\u201d or negative event [16]. Social media has also dramatically changed the way in which individuals seek, share, and consume information [17] such that content that goes \u201cviral\u201d on social media may not originate from an organization, nor even be related to a real event, but it is able to evoke high arousal emotions (e.g. fear or joy), as well as dominance, or feelings of control, that stem from broadcasting the content [18]. During the 2012 EHM outbreak in the Netherlands, the topic \u201cherpes virus neurology\u201d was visited more than 90,000 times/day [7] as members of the public and equine industry sought information about the disease. Scientific literacy among adults is limited and as is their inability to recognize misinformation in social media environments [19] therefore, it is imperative that information-seeking behaviors of the public are understood by government agencies, Extension agents, and veterinarians to maximize effective crisis communication during a disease outbreak.",

The study reported herein was conducted following the 2014 VS outbreak to learn how perceptions of accuracy and availability of news sources affect how members of the Colorado equine industry seek both everyday information as well as information during an equine disease outbreak. Some underlying hypotheses were that the surveyed members of the Colorado equine industry would select resources related to equine disease outbreaks based on their availability and accuracy and that younger industry members (age < 30 years) would rely more heavily on social media for all types of information. The identification of why Colorado equine industry members access information from specific sources would allow animal health and Extension professionals to tailor their online presence to accommodate the communication needs of the Colorado equine industry.",

For questions 2 and 3, survey participants were asked to rate their confidence in the accuracy or availability, respectively, of the news sources provided in question 1 using a 7-point likert scale (1 = not at all, 7 = totally trust or available). Survey responses for questions 1-4, 6, and 8 were then curated into larger categories prior to statistical analyses. Participants were allowed to select as many roles in the equine industry as applied. Industry roles that were not categorized included Competitive riders, Pleasure riders, and Horse owners. Veterinarians, farriers, horse trainers, and horse breeders were included in a role category of Equine professionals, while students and industry professionals were categorized as an Other role. If a participant listed multiple roles, then they were categorized based on the role presumed to provide the greatest professional training or knowledge related to equine disease. For example, a veterinarian/competitive rider was categorized as an equine professional and a competitive rider/horse owner was categorized as a competitive rider.",

Traditional print sources (The Horse, Chronicles of the Horse, EQUUS) and online resources (WebMD for Pets) that rely on advertising or subscription were categorized with television (TV), radio, and newspaper as Traditional or for-Profit sources. Resources related to CSU or the state of Colorado, or Extension were categorized as State; whereas resources related to the practice of equine medicine (Equine Disease Communication Center, Gluck Quarterly Report) or dissemination of information from veterinary organizations (American Association of Equine Practitioners Resources for Horse Owners), including the participant\u2019s veterinarian, were categorized as Veterinary. The authors acknowledge that overlap of these categories may exist in the participant responses. For example, the participant\u2019s veterinarian may have been a CSU employee, or the survey participant considered the CSU Veterinary Extension to be associated with CSU resources. Additionally, social media can be a gateway [31] to traditional, state, veterinary, or other resources with a social media presence. Furthermore, many traditional news sources, including local newspapers, radio and TV stations, now also have an online and social media presence [32].",

The study design may also result in some overlap in news sources for everyday news as many traditional news sources have an online presence and online news sources may be accessed from a social media site. Nonetheless, the preference for younger survey participants to seek everyday news from social media, regardless of whether they later use an online source, is not surprising given the generational divide in social media use worldwide [36]. Additionally, age and news source affect the ratings individuals give for accuracy and availability of everyday sources. While social media sources were viewed as less trustworthy, older survey participants found social media news sources to be significantly less available than traditional or online sources (Figure 2). The study participant\u2019s role in the equine industry did not influence perceptions of accuracy for everyday news. In the event of a disease outbreak, industry role was a significant factor in selection of news sources, whereas age was not, with 69.9% of the respondents preferring state or veterinary resources. Although perceptions of accuracy significantly affect where individuals gather equine disease information, neither accuracy nor availability affects the reason why individuals gather everyday information. Lastly, there is a significant association between where individuals decide to seek information first in the event of an equine disease outbreak, and whether they consider the accuracy or availability of the information source to be more important (Figure 3).",

            "text": "To some extent, participant age and perceptions of source accuracy and availability all influence where and why individuals access disease information. In a similar study of the information seeking preferences of beef producers in Oklahoma, their veterinarian was their preferred source for animal health related issues or during a crisis, with a high degree of trust in state, federal and local Extension resources [37]. These individuals also listed TV and the Internet as secondary resources during a crisis event, and nearly half preferred receiving information on an agriculturally related crisis via a county Extension publication [37]. Other studies that have evaluated information-seeking preferences among members of the equine industry have also demonstrated veterinarians to be a preferred source of information [20,[23], [24], [25],27]. Of note, more than 90% of competitive riders in the US prefer obtaining horse health information from their veterinarians, but more than 80% of these individuals still use the internet to obtain this information [25]. Surveys of equine care-givers in the Midwest demonstrate that 77% of respondents seek information from their veterinarian, whereas only 7% will seek out an Extension specialist, even though veterinarians and Extension specialists are among their most trusted resources [24]. Interestingly, Extension specialists were not reported to be a source of information during an equine disease outbreak in this study. Extension in Colorado is facilitated by CSU; given the study design it is possible that Veterinary Extension resources in Colorado were viewed by the survey participants as a CSU-related resource in the survey responses rather than as Extension. However, at the time of this study it is also possible that members of the Colorado equine industry related CSU Extension with more general animal health information needs and not necessarily information related to an equine disease outbreak.",

Additionally, the eXtension Foundation has expanded the resources available to Extension agents by providing a central point for collaboration. Topics in equine welfare or care are primarily included in surveys reporting Extension program needs [20,29,46] or information-seeking behaviors of the equine industry [24,25,27]. While online learning tools such as webinars [47] or websites with timely topics in equine care [48] have had a positive impact, they have focused on animal care or emergency preparedness, not actual crisis event communication. In response to the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Extension programs provided specific recommendations for equine facilities to execute social distancing recommendations as well as access to additional resources [49,50]. Future studies evaluating the information-seeking behaviors of the Colorado equine industry may also demonstrate Extension to be a preferred resource during a crisis event.",

A significant limitation of this study is that it utilized a voluntary response sample with an online survey distributed via internet dependent means such as email and social media. Nonetheless, our data suggest that people value the accuracy of state and veterinary resources, but at the time that the survey was conducted the industry did not perceive these resources to be available. The results of this study were shared in 2017 with the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) State Veterinarian\u2019s Office (SVO) and qualitative information regarding CDA strategies for disseminating information was obtained. The CDA Animal Health Division website (https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/aganimals) has \u201cFAQ\u201d links to \u201cCurrent Disease Outbreaks in the US\u201d and a direct link to the Equine Disease Communication Center (http://www.equinediseasecc.org/alerts/outbreaks). The CDA-SVO also has a social media presence via the Colorado Department of Agriculture Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/coloradoag/). This page shares disease information through condensed news releases and short informational messages. This state resource is designed to stop rumors, connect with the industry, and disseminate accurate veterinary information, while also allowing the CDA to gather information about what is going on in the industry. In relation to Colorado VSV cases, the CDA-SVO Facebook page was initially used in 2014, but mainly to put out periodic news releases to give factual data on VSV cases, including current updates on the CDA-SVO\u2019s response and resources for horse owners. In 2015, the CDA-SVO enhanced their use of social media and their Facebook page became a resource to a quell rumors and to provide real time answers to specific questions by the public. In addition, the Facebook page directed individuals and veterinarians to call the CDA for more information. In conjunction with the Facebook page, the CDA website was also used to quell rumors that were discovered on Facebook, provide general scientific/factual information about the disease, and give weekly updates on the incident and the animal health emergency response that was being conducted. During the 2019 VSV outbreak was the first time the CDA-SVO used their Facebook page to communicate with the public regarding statistics and VSV information, including dissemination of a dedicated webpage for Colorado VSV cases. In addition to weekly updates via Facebook, changes in statutes allowed USDA accredited veterinarians to conduct VSV investigations and the CDA-VSO Facebook page was used to communicate guidelines for VSV sample submissions for said veterinarians. Conducted in 2016, this survey demonstrated that the Colorado equine industry members considered the availability of state resources to be relatively low, which is consistent with the limited online or social media presence during the 2014 VS outbreak. The evolution of the CDA-SVO social media and online communication from the 2014 to 2019 outbreaks demonstrates their dedication to the accurate spread of information during a disease outbreak.",

These two constructs appear not to affect the reason why they access the information. Nearly 70% of the survey participants prefer a state or veterinary resource during a disease outbreak, a selection driven by accuracy of the information to be obtained from that source. On the other hand, use of other news sources is driven by availability of these sources. Animal health and Extension professionals may consider either strategies that improve the availability or public visibility of state and/or veterinary resources, or they could focus on providing accurate information via a social media platform. Regardless of the method of information transmission, we must all ensure that younger generations are equipped to identify misinformation so that social media can remain a positive avenue for the exchange of information in the equine industry.",
