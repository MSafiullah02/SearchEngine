            "text": "Three different, mutually non-exclusive modes of influenza transmission have been identified and discussed so far: droplet, airborne and contact transmission.1, 2, 3, 4 Droplet transmission requires the infectious case to directly spray large droplets by coughing or sneezing onto conjunctiva or mucous membranes of a susceptible host. Airborne transmission through droplet nuclei does not require face-to-face contact with the infectious case. Droplet nuclei settle from the air slowly, are respirable and can thus transmit the virus directly into the alveolar region. Contact transmission occurs either indirectly through contact with secretions on fomites or directly such as through physical touch between an infected individual and a susceptible host.1, 5 We need to emphasize that there is no unique and generally agreed-upon classification of airborne droplets, for example, concerning the aerodynamic diameter d\na which defines the cut-off size between droplet nuclei and large droplets. Definitions and classifications differ between medicine and aerosol science and depend on explanatory interest. When evaluating airborne transmission, a cut-off point of 5 \u03bcm is commonly chosen.1 We, however, propose a (post-evaporation) value of 10 \u03bcm because droplets of this size can remain airborne for several minutes. The settling time for a 10-\u03bcm particle from a height of 1.5 m is 491 s; the settling time then drops rapidly with increasing particle size.6 In the following we only use the terms droplet nuclei and large droplets; Table 1\nand Fig. 1\nsummarize the concepts, terms and interrelationships important for the description of transmission modes.",

            "text": "One factor contributing to the relative importance of each of the three transmission modes is the inactivation of influenza A viruses in different environmental media. Sometimes, viruses in transmission are described as being \u201coutside of their natural habitat\u201d17 (p. 457); transmission, however, is an integral part of the \u201clife\u201d cycle of viruses and thus shaped by natural selection.22 A full understanding of transmission modes requires a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms on several different levels of organization, from virion structure to aspects of human behavior and social organization. We consider these latter aspects if necessary, but focus on the characteristics of transport medium and their consequences for virus inactivation. The empirical study of these issues is never easy, but especially challenging for aerosols. The size distribution of respiratory aerosols, their size changes after expulsion2 and subsequent inhalation,23 the pathogen concentration and the mechanisms of virus inactivation are factors that are very difficult to study empirically. Environmental persistence is key parameter, because it can place strict limits on the impact of a transmission pathway. Despite its probable relevance, and possibly because of the empirical challenges, the issue of environmental persistence and mode of transmission of influenza A has remained a comparatively neglected topic. Charles V. Chapin claimed in 1910 that communicable respiratory infections are transmitted by means of large droplets over short distances or through contact with contaminated surfaces.24 This claim has remained dominant ever since. The paradigm of droplet and contact transmission experienced a temporary challenge through the pioneering work of William F. Wells, who produced experimental evidence for the existence of droplet nuclei as a means of airborne transmission of respiratory diseases. The airborne route of infection and influenza virus inactivation in aerosols was quite intensely researched from the late 1930s to the early 1980s,25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 received some still contested epidemiological support,45 but then failed to attract noteworthy attention for many years. Outside the community of influenza researchers the topic of airborne transmission and virus inactivation remained of some interest46; a review concluded that airborne transmission is possible for numerous types of viruses.47 In influenza research, the airborne route only recently has regained significant and controversial interest.3, 4, 48, 49 There appears to be agreement that airborne transmission is at least possible, but there is strong disagreement about importance. There are a number of reasons for this renewed attention to the airborne transmission route, for example the need to consider and develop non-pharmaceutical interventions in case of a pandemic14, 15 or emerging diseases such as SARS where the transmission mode remained controversial and uncertain for some time and it subsequently turned out that airborne transmission was feasible.50 These developments, and the threat of bioterrorism,51 have reopened and revitalized the debate about the transmission modes of influenza.",

Tropism of human influenza A virus is determined by the binding to glycolipids or glycans that contain terminal sialyl-galactosyl residues with a 2-6 linkage, Sia\u03b12-6. Avian viruses bind to Sia\u03b12-3. Another important determinant of tropism is the specificity of the protease cleavage site on the HA protein, which in human and avian low-pathogenicity viruses can be cleaved only by trypsin-like proteases present in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. In highly pathogenic avian viruses this site has mutated and can be cleaved by proteases found in many tissues. A number of recent studies attempting to define distribution and targets of human and avian influenza viruses have resulted in a range of sometimes conflicting results.61, 62, 63 These discrepancies make it particularly difficult to identify unambiguously the range of potential target cells of influenza virus contained in aerosol particles of different sizes. A precautionary approach suggests that both upper and lower respiratory tract down to the alveoli should be regarded as targets.",

Several investigators found that aerosolized influenza virus survives well at low RH and is inactivated quickly at medium and high RH.28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34 Other researchers identified a distinct survival minimum at middle RH and an increase in survival at high RH30 or at both low and high RH.43 Low temperatures increase survival at each level of RH.33\nTable 2\nsummarizes the range of daily inactivation rates (first-order rate constants) for influenza viruses if the value could be estimated from the data or graphs provided. Some studies only provide maximum survival times and insufficient information on initial titer and it is thus impossible to estimate inactivation rates. Maximum survival times vary between 1 h (80% RH) and 24 h (20% RH).29 Comparing the survival of human, avian, swine and equine influenza A viruses in aerosols, it was found that equine and avian influenza viruses survive much longer in the airborne state (24\u201336 h) than human influenza viruses (9\u201318 h).39, 41 These experiments suffer from a number of serious problems that severely limit their value; they were performed at 75% RH, virus preparations were not quantified with any degree of precision and human influenza viruses were grown in embryonated eggs at the suboptimal temperature of 37 \u00b0C.",

            "text": "Many studies addressing the topic of RH and influenza A virus inactivation were motivated by the strong seasonality of inter-pandemic influenza in higher latitudes. The experimental results cited above imply that low RH in heated indoor environments in winter support influenza virus survival; a predominantly indoor living mode during this time of year facilitates transmission and the outbreak of epidemics. It has been suggested that enveloped viruses in general show this pattern of RH- and temperature-dependence.75 Several recent epidemiological studies on influenza in the tropical regions put into doubt this generalization. In the city of Pune in Western India, the highest numbers of influenza A isolates are identified in the rainy months from July to September76 and in Dakar, Senegal, influenza incidence peaks during the hot and rainy season.77 In North-East Brazil, peak periods of influenza A and B also occurred during the rainy season.78 In equatorial Brazil, peak influenza activity coincides with periods of high humidity, whereas colder temperatures are associated with increased viral activity in subtropical regions of Brazil.79 However, epidemics also occurred in these countries outside of the rainy season80, 81 and there is no correlation between rainfall and influenza virus activity.82 The findings on influenza in tropical regions thus do not offer a clear-cut picture of seasonality, but they strongly suggest that the seasonal timing of outbreaks is not driven exclusively by the RH-dependence of virus inactivation in aerosols.31 A recent hypothesis states that in the tropics contact transmission might predominate, whereas in temperate climate airborne transmission prevails48: in conditions of high humidity exhaled respiratory droplets will grow and thus settle quickly on surfaces and become available for contact transmission. This explanation fails to convince. It is realistic to assume that the size distribution of expelled respiratory droplets is created at 100% RH at the moment of expulsion. Even at a high RH of 80% respiratory droplets quickly decrease in diameter.7 Water droplets with a diameter of 1 \u03bcm evaporate within a few milliseconds, even at high RH. Droplets with a diameter of 100 \u03bcm survive up to 1 min at high RH. The time dependent equation for the droplet diameter d(t) after an expiratory event shows that the droplet diameter at time t converges to its initial value d\n0 as the relative humidity increases.2 The presence of nonvolatile solutes in the expulsed material does not significantly change these patterns. After a cough or sneeze, there will be more large droplets at high RH than at low RH available to settle on surfaces, but there will also remain plenty of airborne fine droplets in both situations. It seems therefore unlikely that a change to a high RH can tip the balance so that contact transmission becomes dominant over airborne transmission. A recent paper49 modifies the earlier hypothesis and argues that transmission by contact is insensitive to RH and temperature with the result that influenza can occur throughout the year in the tropics. However, no data are provided on the inactivation of virus on surfaces as a function of temperature or RH. We are aware of only one study that investigates the outcome of drying on glass slides on the infectivity of influenza A virus.83 At 20% RH and 20 \u00b0C they found an inactivation rate of 38 day\u22121, at 84% RH and 20 \u00b0C an inactivation rate of 77 day\u22121. These data suggest that inactivation on non-porous surfaces is sensitive to RH. However, the suggestion that differences in inactivation-dependencies in aerosols and on surfaces may lead to changes in transmission regimes is interesting and merits comprehensive experimental scrutiny.",

The airborne environment is hostile to microorganisms owing to desiccation, radiation, ozone and pollutants. An influenza virus can be inactivated by damaging the RNA, the protein coat or the lipid bilayer and the associated glycoproteins. Only inactivation of viral RNA through UV radiation represents a straightforward mechanism of inactivation. Decreasing temperature increases the lipid ordering of the envelope and thus perhaps the stability of influenza A.94 The effect of RH on influenza virus suggests a crucial role of water in inactivation processes. Water is essential in the formation and maintenance of the bilayer structure of the viral envelope. Perhaps this integrity is guaranteed at low to medium RH. The inactivation of suspended virus by shaking is correlated with the generation of a continuously renewing air\u2013water interface.95 Because of their hydrophobic nature, lipid-containing viruses tend to accumulate at the surface of droplets and there they might be subjected to surface forces that destroy the lipid bilayer.",

At low RH and low to moderately high temperature (up to 25 \u00b0C) and if not exposed to UV radiation and pollutants, influenza A viruses may remain alive and infectious for a considerable time in the airborne state. Taking into account that the airborne infectious dose ID50 (the dose that infects 50% of the exposed persons) is in the range of only 0.6\u20133.0 TissueCultureID50,37 transmission through fine droplets becomes even more plausible. Droplet transmission is usually considered to be the most important transmission mode, but transmission through this pathway is most likely a rare event.96 Inactivation is unlikely to be a limiting factor for droplet transmission, but calculations based on the aerodynamics of large droplets show that even a close cough is unlikely to cause infection, whereas a close, unprotected, horizontally directed sneeze may be potent enough to cause droplet transmission.96 It remains unknown how common such an event is, but such sneezes are probably quite rare in adults. Droplet transmission through is also constrained by the infectious dose: The nasal infectious dose is in the range of 100\u20131000 TCID50\n97, 98; we could find no estimates for the ocular infectious dose of influenza A. The human conjunctival epithelium does not express the Sia\u03b12-6 but rather the Sia\u03b12-399 so human influenza viruses cannot infect the epithelium; it remains to be seen whether viruses inoculated in the eye could find their way to the nasal mucosa through the lacrymal ducts in sufficient amount to initiate an infection.

At 35\u201340% RH, typical for indoor environments, influenza A virus survives for more than 24\u201348 h on stainless steel and plastic surfaces, but drops to undetectable levels after 8\u201312 h on porous surfaces such as paper tissue, pajamas or paper.105 Transfer of viable influenza A virus from paper tissue to hands was only possible for 15 min, but transfer from stainless steel to hands for 24 h. The first-order inactivation rates of viruses on porous surfaces are approximately 24 day\u22121 and 2.9 day\u22121 on stainless steel; the latter value is an order of magnitude lower than the value reported for glass surfaces.83 After the transfer to hands from both surface types, viable virus fell to low titers within 5 min; first-order inactivation rates on hands range from 1300 to 2100 day\u22121; high spontaneous decay of influenza A virus on skin was also found in another study.106 On Swiss banknotes influenza A viruses of the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have very low inactivation rates.107 H1N1 shows a low inactivation rate of approximately 0.05 day\u22121. The surprising finding is that influenza A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2) showed no significant inactivation whatsoever after 10 days. Nasal mucus has a strong survival enhancing effect, probably mediated in part through stabilization by proteins and salts.43 This might explain why influenza A virus can be detected on a wide range of fomites in homes and day care centers.108\n",

If people are not directly observed, nose-picking and eye-rubbing occur at a rate of approximately 0.4 h\u22121; if people are facing each other the rate is 10 times smaller.111 These data suggest that the importance of contact transmission will depend on the environmental context. The significance of environmental context, i.e. type of surfaces and presence of observers, will interact with physiological mechanisms. As already mentioned above, the nasal infectious dose ID50 is in the range of 100\u20131000 TCID50, whereas the airborne ID50 is in the range of 0.6\u20133.0 TCID50. Still, given these differences in ID50 it is difficult to judge intuitively which mode of transmission will prevail in a setting like a crowded train, cinema or theatre.

These results imply that avian influenza viruses can under circumstances of low salinity and low temperatures persist many weeks in water.

For Myobacterium tuberculosis a risk of 0.79% is calculated for 1 h of exposure (assuming an inactivation rate of 2.77 day\u22121). This estimate relies on the assumption that one bacterium may be enough to cause an infection; estimates of the minimum infective dose for tuberculosis range from 1 to 5 bacili.131 For influenza, the airborne infectious dose (ID50, see above) is approximately 0.67 TCID50 for virus reaching the respiratory epithelium.96 It is not clear how many virions correspond to one unit of TCID50; reported ratios of TCID50 to number of virions are 1:100, 1:400 and 1:650.132, 133, 134 A rough calculation based on volumes of droplets and virions suggests that between 103 and 107 virions fit into droplets with diameters between 1 and 10 \u03bcm; these numbers do not take into account virus inactivation or packing and thus give an upper limit for the number of infective virions per droplet. These estimates, however, show that a dose of 0.67 TCID50 could easily fit into one droplet. Therefore the risk calculated for M. tuberculosis might furnish us at least with a reasonable estimate of the order of magnitude of the risk for airborne infection of influenza. A second, more detailed, approach presents an integrated model of the different modes of transmission, which provides a quantification of the rates of pathogen transfer at different steps of the transmission pathways.19 In addition, also the pathogen dose and infection risk to a health care worker (HCW) in a scenario, in which the HCW attends a patient with a transmissible respiratory disease, is estimated. The model considers inhalation of aerosol, respiratory droplet spray and contact transmission via surfaces. For close contact events, the authors calculate the infection risk per cough, given that the HCW is at close range at the moment of the patient's cough. For estimating the risk through contact transmission it is assumed that the HCW spends 15 min in the vicinity of the patient. In their scenario, the infection risk due to droplet spray is 50-fold greater than infection risk due to respirable pathogens (0.021 vs. 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22124). The infection risk due to hand contact with mucous membranes is 0.029. The calculated risks will depend very much on the specific pathogen. One assumption is, for example, that inactivation rates are the same for aerosols, on porous and non-porous inanimate surfaces and on hands. For influenza, such an assumption would certainly overestimate the risk of infection through contact transmission because virus survival on hands is very low.",

A number of reasons seem to be responsible for this state of affairs. First, this reflects lack of profound interest \u2013 influenza was rarely perceived to be a critical threat to public health and the dogma of large droplet transmission was only rarely challenged. The risk perception concerning influenza has, though, undoubtedly changed in the past few years. Second, there are serious methodological difficulties studying transmission of influenza. Quick and accurate diagnosis of early stages of influenza was always hard and this renders detailed epidemiological studies of outbreak and transmission dynamics challenging. Many epidemiological studies in closed communities (health care settings, schools, etc.) still analyze respiratory illness based on symptoms and do not differentiate between the causes. Third, there is a lack of knowledge concerning fundamental biological and physical parameters affecting transmission pathways and disciplinary boundaries impeding the transfer, reception and acceptance of information. Inactivation of influenza A virus in different environmental media and the dynamic processes determining the fate of aerosols expelled by coughs or sneezes are two critical factors potentially affecting the epidemiology of the disease. There is an undisputable need for more information concerning the inactivation of influenza viruses: quite a number of studies investigated the survival of the influenza virus in different media, but most of the studies are several decades old. In contrast, the physical dynamics of aerosols are in fact well-known,2 but the complexities are often not appreciated in the biomedical literature on influenza. And fourth, influenza can probably be transmitted via all three pathways. Thus it is perhaps not surprising that no single mode can be blamed for most infections. However, given the need to formulate robust and efficient non-pharmaceutical control measures in case of a new pandemic, more quantitative estimates for the importance of the different transmission modes are called for.",

These findings, in combination with theoretical and empirical findings from aerosol science show that, to phrase it carefully, airborne transmission of influenza cannot be dismissed. To phrase it more boldly, under some circumstances, airborne transmission may even be dominant. Let us quickly summarize the findings on virus inactivation and aerosol dynamics. Aerosolized influenza viruses are stable at low RH and low to moderately high temperatures. Conflicting experimental evidence and the epidemiology of influenza in tropical regions cast some doubt on the finding that high RH significantly decreases virus survival. The inactivation rate constants found in these studies can differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols these rates are in the order of 1\u2013102, on hands in the order of 103. The lowest inactivation rates \u2013 in the order of 10\u22121\u201310\u22122 \u2013 are reported for avian influenza viruses in cool water with low salinity. Half-life of influenza A viruses in aerosols can thus range from 1 to 16 h. Assuming a well-mixed room setting and given the low airborne infectious dose it seems likely that virus inactivation will not critically constrain airborne transmission via fine droplets. High inactivation rates on hands, however, may limit contact transmission.",

            "text": "It still remains very difficult to assess the relative importance of transmission through large droplets vs. droplet nuclei because very different mechanisms are at play in the two cases. Droplet transmission requires the direct deposition of large droplets on the mucosa of a susceptible person and only mechanisms that occur immediately after expulsion (<1 s) in a restricted space around the event matter. Therefore, virus inactivation and gravitational settling of particles do not play a major role. In order for droplet transmission to occur infected and susceptible persons have to be in close contact (several tens of cm apart), of comparable height and the sneeze or cough has to be directed in the \u201cright\u201d direction. The stopping distances of expelled particles provide another telling illustration of the complexities involved in droplet transmission: particles smaller than 488 \u03bcm (cough) or 232 \u03bcm (sneeze) will not travel further than 60 cm.96 In contrast, contact transmission via fomites and airborne transmission via fine droplets will depend on mechanisms that occur at different spatial scales and over longer time-periods: the size distribution of expelled particles equilibrates nearly instantaneously through very rapid evaporation,2 large particles settle quickly on surfaces and fine particles can remain airborne for considerable time. The risk of infection will thus depend on the interaction of virus inactivation, infectious dose and on behavioral parameters. There is insufficient information to quantify reliably the risk of influenza A infection via fomites or through the airborne route, but reported values for virus inactivation and infectious dose make it plausible that transmission through both pathways can occur. However, transmission through fomites probably depends far more on flexible, context-dependent behaviors than airborne transmission. It is also important to note, that influenza virus can show unexpectedly high stability on some non-biological surfaces.107\n",

Wearing simple face masks significantly reduced the risk of infection from SARS-CoV.139, 140 N95 masks are even more effective.141 If these findings are relevant for influenza is unknown.

It is beyond the scope of this review to go into details of the biochemistry and biophysics of lipid membranes, but a few points deserve mentioning. It has long been known that the lipid composition of the viral and cellular membrane can differ significantly.144 On the other hand, various strains of the influenza A virus have different fatty acid compositions even if they are derived from the same cell type.145 It remains to be convincingly shown in which way the lipids and other components of the host cell play a role in determining the phenotype and thus the phenotype\u2013environment interaction of enveloped viruses.",
