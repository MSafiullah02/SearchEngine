After initial full\u2010scan screening, the potential metabolites identified can be further confirmed along with possible sites of biotransformation identified by performing precursor ion scan, product\u2010ion scan, as well as neutral loss scan. The disadvantage of this approach is that a single MS/MS experiment is usually insufficient for localizing the site of biotransformation. An ITMS is then an attractive choice since it can be used to narrow down the site of biotransformation by studying the fragmentation patterns from the MSn experiments.13\n",

Arbidol and its metabolites have some common fragmentation patterns as a result of the homolytic bond cleavage. This cleavage will form odd\u2010electron ions with the loss of a radical. The arbidol fragmentation sequence is first to lose dimethylamine (45 Da), followed by the loss of acetaldehyde (44 Da), and then the phenylthio radical (109 Da). This fragmentation sequence is also observed from N\u2010demethylarbidol (N1), sulfonylarbidol (N2\u20102), and N\u2010demethylsulfonylarbidol (M3\u20102). However, for sulfinylarbidol (M1\u20102) and N\u2010demethylsulfinylarbidol (M2\u20102), the fragmentation sequence is reversed so that the phenylsulfiny radical (125 Da) was lost first, followed by the loss of dimethylamine (45 Da), and then acetaldehyde (44 Da).
