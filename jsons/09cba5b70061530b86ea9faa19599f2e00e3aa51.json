IEDB services is one of the computational methods; the output of this study showed that S glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein, and S and E protein modified sequences of MERS-CoV might be considered as a protective immunogenic with high conservancy because they can elect both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses when reacting with B-cell, T-helper cell, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte.

Population coverage analysis showed that the putative helper T-cell epitopes and CTL epitopes could cover most of the world population in more than 60 geographical regions.
