An outbreak of EV-D68 was shown to be the cause of the increased incidence of respiratory infections. Because EV-D68 was not detected by our routine respiratory panel at that time, we added an enterovirus PCR into our routine screening panel of 14 respiratory viruses (Influenza A, Influenza B, parainfluenzavirus 1\u20134, coronaviruses OC43, NL63 and 229E, adenovirus, bocavirus, RSV-A, RSV-B and human metapneumovirus). Moreover, we expanded our testing by routinely sequencing all enterovirus and rhinovirus strains to identify virus strains and to chart outbreaks and transmission patterns. Adding to this sequencing strategy, we included noroviruses as well as parechoviruses. Nationally, a structure called TYPENED was available through the Dutch National Institute of Health (RIVM) [3]. Furthermore, by using our regional sequencing and epidemiological strategy, called REGIOTYPE, we were able to speed up the flow of information from our region, including hospitals and Public Health Services covering the (not densely populated) Northern part of the Netherlands. The aim of this REGIOTYPE strategy is to provide a rapid sequencing service for the whole region. This not only completes our diagnostics with sequencing data, but as clinical data are fed back into our database, we create a source of information which serves to obtain more insights in epidemiology patterns.",

The ECDC rapid risk assessment attributes the low level of reporting of EV-D68 to the low number of laboratories which routinely screen respiratory samples for EV-D68. Subsequently, only a small number of EV-D68 cases (11) are observed in the Netherlands during the enterovirus \u2018peak season\u2019 in 2014, through both the entero-surveillance and the ILI/ARI surveillance networks [5]. However, we are observing an increase in infections caused by EV-D68 in our tertiary care hospital since May 2014, similar to the outbreak in the USA and Canada. To improve the specific diagnostics for EV-68, we developed a specific real-time PCR method.",

In the 2009\u20132010 upsurge, a number of children became severely ill. Moreover, it was then shown that 21% of the cases were hospital acquired, which highlights the need for testing of not only patients with severe respiratory disease, but also patients with mild symptoms, who may spread the virus.

From QCMD quality assurance data, it is known that the respiratory virus testing performed in a number of laboratories failed to detect EV-D68 (Dr. Paul Wallace, personal communication, QCMD, Glasgow, United Kingdom).",

Although no exact data exists on underdiagnoses as yet, it is our experience that clinicians, at least in the Netherlands, are discouraged from performing diagnostic tests for patients presenting with probable viral illnesses because of financial constraints. And if testing is done, only influenza virus and RSV are preferably tested.",

Further epidemiological information is needed on a larger scale than currently available to determine the circulation for this virus. The implicit risk of focusing on a limited number of viruses for diagnostic purposes, or not performing virological diagnostics at all, is contestable. Patients with an underlying disease, whether children, transplant patients, or patient with a chronic respiratory condition, are not getting optimal care if the diagnostic options are limited or even absent. Therefore, a diagnostic stewardship program should be discussed asides antimicrobial stewardship and an infection control programs, which are currently being introduced in many hospitals [9]. We have documented upsurges of EV-D68 associated with sometimes severe morbidity twice in the last 5 years, i.e. in 2009/2010 and in 2014. It can be anticipated that the virus will reappear regularly and therefore diagnostic assays, whether LDTs or commercial assays, should be able to detect this virus. The EV-D68 specific assay we describe in this paper, may be used for this purpose.",

EV-D68 is associated with at times severe respiratory illness. Adequate surveillance for viruses like EV-D68 which can cause severe respiratory illnesses, is therefore desirable for University Medical Centers and Reference Centers. A collaborative approach effort between the diagnostic and reference laboratories could be taken to achieve this. The EV-D68 specific assay we present in this paper may aid in the assessment of the real prevalence of this virus in our population, both in children and adults.",
