            "text": "Acronyms represent a significant and idiosyncratic part of our everyday vocabulary. The demands of a highly technical society have dramatically increased the proportion of acronyms encountered in everyday language. Acronyms are nowadays regularly found in scientific and nonscientific journals (e.g., DNA, EEG, CD-ROM, DVD, radar, sonar, VAT, CPI, OXO, NATO, NHS, etc.) and are actively used in text messages and e-mail communications (e.g., lol, MYOB, BW, etc.). The practice of abbreviating complex words is not new (e.g., INRI is an acronym that dates back to Roman times); however, their use has been relatively sparse until the second world war, when the formation of new acronyms escalated, since they were a convenient way of accelerating and encrypting communication. As an indication of the breathtaking expansion of acronyms in the language, the first edition (1960) of the Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations Dictionary (AIAD) comprised 12,000 headwords, while the 16th edition (1992) included more than 520,000 headwords. The AIAD dictionary has been recognized as one of the most important books of reference by the American Library Association (1985), and its 43rd edition has just been made available to the public in June 2010. Strictly speaking, the term acronym refers to pronounceable abbreviations formed with the initial letters of a compound term, while initialism is the name for the same type of abbreviations that are \u201cunpronounceable.\u201d Despite this original distinction, the label initialism is rarely used, while acronym has extended its meaning to pronounceable and unpronounceable abbreviations. It is in this extended sense that the term acronym is going to be used here.",

            "text": "A distinctive characteristic of acronyms is that their configuration does not obey orthographic and/or phonological rules. They are often formed by a sequence of illegal letter strings that can become highly familiar to the language user (e.g., ABC, BBC, CNN, FBI, fm, HIV, KFC, pm, TV, USB, etc.). Due to this peculiar illegality, acronyms have recently been used in the study of two influential models of reading aloud: the triangle model and the dual-route cascade model (Laszlo & Federmeier, 2007b). An important discrepancy between these two models lies in the relative relevance given to the frequency of the word in contrast to its regularity when it is read aloud. One of the models under investigation in Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b) was the connectionist triangle model (Harm & Seidenberg, 2004; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989). The model proposes a single processing system for reading all known words, irrespective of their frequency and regularity, and all unknown/novel words. This is achieved by means of a learning mechanism that extracts the statistically more reliable (frequent) spelling\u2013sound relationships in English. Importantly, orthographic and/or phonological rules are redundant in the model, and therefore, they have not been specifically implemented. The other model investigated is the nonconnectionist dual-route cascade model (Coltheart, Curtis, Atkins, & Haller, 1993; Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001). It proposes two reading routes or procedures: a lexical route and a nonlexical route. The lexical route entails direct connections between the mental representations of the written form of the word and the spoken form of the word and, also, detoured connections between written and spoken word forms with their corresponding conceptual representations in the semantic system. The nonlexical route converts letters into sounds applying the orthographic and phonologic rules of the language. The latter route is indispensable for reading novel words and nonwords, since no mental representation for them has been formed. Nonlexical processing will also give the correct pronunciation of regular words, although this is not the only reading pathway available to them. Correct reading of irregular words, however, needs to be accomplished via the lexical route, since these words do not stick to the pronunciation rules of the language.",

            "text": "Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b) tested these models by looking at the differential N400 repetition effect found for words (hat) and pseudowords (e.g., dawk) but not for orthographically illegal nonwords (mdtp). They argued that according to the dual-route model, the sensitivity of the N400 component to the repetition of legal letter strings, for both words and pseudowords (Deacon, Dynowska, Ritter, & Grose-Fifer, 2004; Rugg, 1990), could only reflect the performance of the nonlexical pathway, since this is the only route available for reading novel items such as the pseudowords. In consequence, no repetition effects in the N400 should be observed when acronyms are read, since their irregularity precludes the use of the nonlexical route. It is important to note that it is not clear how the predicted and reported absence of repetition effects for illegal letter strings fits into the argument, since illegal letter strings also make use of the nonlexical pathway. Connectionist models, alternatively, would predict repetition effects in the N400 for words, pseudowords, and acronyms, since the same process underpins the recognition of any type of letter string. Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b) found N400 repetition effects for words, pseudowords, and acronyms, but not for illegal nonwords. They concluded that this outcome could be accommodated only by the connectionist account for oral reading. However, Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b) failed to notice that pseudowords\u2014in particular, pseudohomophones and those pseudowords extracted from high-frequency words\u2014can generate activation in the lexical pathway (Coltheart, 2007). The lexical route will not produce the correct reading of pseudowords but can be, nevertheless, stimulated. Taking this into account, their results can be perfectly explained by the dual-route model through the activation of the lexical route by words, acronyms, and pseudowords. This explanation also reconciles better with the lexico-semantic processing found to be associated with the N400 component (Sheehan, Namy, & Mills, 2007; van Elk, van Schie, & Bekkering, 2010). Equivalent N400 amplitudes were found for words and acronyms in a subsequent study (Laszlo & Federmeier, 2008) in which the N400 sentence anomaly paradigm was used. The authors concluded that this pattern of results is not reconcilable with the dual-route model.",

Gibson, Bishop, Schiff, and Smith (1964), for example, investigated the relative contribution that meaningfulness and pronounceability had in the WSE. They devised two experimental conditions: one formed by meaningful but unpronounceable trigrams (these were all acronyms), and the other by meaningless but pronounceable trigrams (these were all pseudowords). They showed an advantage for acronyms in word recognition memory and recall, suggesting that meaning, rather than pronounceability, had a more powerful influence in these processes. Similar results were reported by Henderson (1974), who also manipulated meaning and pronounceability using acronyms and pseudowords. He found that participants were faster at judging pairs of items as being the same (e.g., FBI\u2013FBI; BLI\u2013BLI) or different (e.g., FBI\u2013IMB; BLI\u2013LSF) if a meaningful item or acronym was in the pair. A number of later studies have replicated the influence of meaning in the WSE, using acronyms in their experimental sets (Laszlo & Federmeier, 2007a; Noice & Hock, 1987; Staller & Lappin, 1981).",

            "text": "In sum, acronyms have been an integral part of experimental manipulations in a number of studies of word recognition and reading (Gibson et al., 1964; Henderson, 1974). The main reason for the use of acronyms has been their unusual combination of meaning and pronunciation, especially because the latter does not obey the standard spelling-to-sound correspondences of the language in use. The orthographic irregularity of acronyms, thus, has been paired with that of illegal letter strings, while their meaning and familiarity have been considered as equivalent to that of other words in the language. Although their meaning and peculiar pronounceability are indeed acronym characteristics, these might have been overemphasized to the detriment of other factors also known to be relevant in oral reading and word recognition processes. First, for example, not all acronyms comprise only consonants or all vowels, and those that do can be read by the application of a particular rule (i.e., letter naming). This rule might make acronyms somehow \u201cregular\u201d and different from other illegal letter strings. Second, acronyms tend to be items that are acquired during adulthood, and there is abundant evidence showing that late learned words are processed slower than early acquired words (for reviews, see Johnston & Barry, 2006; Juhasz, 2005). Third, acronyms are related to a more restricted number of familiar meanings than are conventional words, and words with few meanings tend to be processed more slowly than words with many meanings (Azuma & Van Orden, 1997; Ferraro & Hansen, 2002; Hino & Lupker, 1996; Klepousniotou & Baum, 2007). Another important difference is that orthographic and phonological length is often uncorrelated in acronyms. In contrast to conventional words, an acronym can often be orthographically short but phonologically long (e.g., HIV has only three letters but five sounds, ai-ch-eye-v-ee\n). Finally, the number of orthographic neighbors associated to acronyms is generally much lower than those found in standard words. Orthographic neighborhood refers to all the words that can be formed by changing one letter from a target word while keeping constant the rest. Evidence shows that words with few orthographic neighbors take longer to be recognized (Alameda & Cuetos, 2000; Andrews, 1992; Perea, Acha, & Fraga, 2008; Whitney & Lavidor, 2005). All these properties (e.g., a late age of acquisition, short letter length, low number of meanings, etc.) make acronyms a very idiosyncratic material, possibly more than ever thought. More important, sets of acronyms and familiar words merely matched in letter length might not be easily comparable, and results from previous studies (Laszlo & Federmeier, 2007a, 2007b, 2008) could have been confounded with a number of uncontrolled variables.",

Acronyms have generally been viewed as some kind of irregular word or even as a sort of \u201cnonword with meaning.\u201d However, the question of whether acronyms are processed as irregular words has never been tested. In order to address this question, the authors contrasted acronym-naming times against a number of lexical and semantic factors known to be relevant when mainstream words are read and manifestly overlooked in previous studies involving acronyms. The study is important since acronyms appear to be an effective material in the investigation of word recognition and reading aloud. Interestingly, in most word recognition and naming studies in which no acronyms but conventional words are used, a careful selection of the material is carried out to ensure that only the factor under investigation varies, while intercorrelated variables are controlled for. Normative data have proven useful in these studies of word recognition and production, yet there is a complete absence of norms for acronyms. This is in spite of the fact that acronyms are not only useful material to facilitate the experimental manipulations in word-processing research, but also a topic of scientific inquiry. Thus, a number of studies (Besner, Davelaar, Alcott, & Parry, 1984; Coltheart, 1978) have been concerned with the lexicality of acronyms, and attempts have been made to clarify whether acronyms enjoy the cognitive status of a word or a nonword. In the latest of these studies, Brysbaert, Speybroeck, and Vanderelst (2009) found that acronyms produced an associative priming effect equivalent to that generated by conventional words, and importantly, this effect was independent of case presentation. Brysbaert et al. (2009) concluded that acronyms are lexicalized items integrated in our mental lexicon.",

The present norms will provide researchers with an inclusive database to enable appropriate experimental control in future research. The factors considered were age of acquisition (AoA), bigram frequency, trigram frequency, imageability, number of orthographic neighbors, number of letters, number of phonemes, number of syllables, acronyms\u2019 print-to-pronunciation pattern, word frequency, word familiarity, and voicing.

The fact that acronyms are orthographically illegal does not necessarily mean that they are processed as irregular words. A major proportion of acronyms are pronounced by naming each constituent letter aloud, which endows acronyms with some kind of regularity that is a long way away from the sporadic grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences characteristic of irregular words. The potential regularity or irregularity of acronyms will be tested by contrasting the impact that a series of factors has on acronym naming and recognition speed and accuracy. Thus, for example, reduced or no AoA effects have been found when regular words are named. Robust AoA effects in acronym reading will indicate similarities between those processes governing acronym naming and irregular word naming.

According to this hypothesis, AoA is the result of arbitrary connections created between two representations in the learning process. Object naming is a good example of this type of unpredictable links, because there is no information in the shape or intrinsic meaning of the object that could possible predict its name. Conversely, when the mapping established between representations is consistent, AoA effects would not be noticeable, since late acquired material will benefit from the regularities extracted from the early acquired material. Research carried out on object and word naming supports the arbitrary mappings hypothesis, showing larger AoA effects in object than word naming, since the nature of the connections between orthography and phonology is more or less consistent in alphabetic languages (Brysbaert & Ghyselinck, 2006; Ghyselinck, Lewis, & Brysbaert, 2004).",

This was supported by the fact that concrete words were rated as more imageable than abstract words (Paivio, 1965). Subsequent research has shown that highly imageable words are better recognized and memorised than low imageable words in tasks of lexical decision and cued and free recall (Balota, Cortese, Sergent-Marshall, Spieler, & Yap, 2004; Kennet, McGuire, Willis, & Schaie, 2000; Paivio 1965). The dual-code hypothesis (Paivio, 1971, 1991) accounts for the imageability effect, arguing that abstract words activate verbal codes, while concrete words activate verbal and imagery codes. The hypothesis states that the assistance of the imagery system facilitates the processing of concrete words.",

Patients with better accuracy at naming abstract words also occur, although these cases have been reported less frequently (Papagno, Capasso, Zerboni, & Miceli, 2007; Reilly, Grossman, & McCawley, 2006). The influence of imageability in unimpaired oral reading, however, is uncertain. Strain, Patterson, and Seidenberg (1995) argued that the imageability influence shown in patients implies a relationship with reading. In Experiments 2 and 3, they found significant interactions between imageability and consistency for low-frequency words. This meant that significant longer times were required to read low-imageability and inconsistent words. In their view, translation from orthography to phonology is fast and efficient for words with regular/consistent spelling patterns (regardless of their frequency or imageability values) because orthography-to-phonology correspondences are assisted by the regular/consistent connections established by high-frequency words. However, low-frequency inconsistent words (e.g., dread, mischief) generate slow naming times, because neither the regularity of the word nor its frequency can aid in their pronunciation. As a consequence, the intervention of semantic information facilitates the reading processes of those inconsistent and low-frequency words with richer semantic representations or high imageability.",

One of the fundamental questions under examination is how the system distinguishes the word to be recognized (e.g., word) from a set of similar candidates (e.g., ward, wore, warm, war). One way in which the lexical similarity of a word has been operationalized is counting the number of words formed by changing one letter from the given word while keeping constant the position and identity of the rest of the letters (Coltheart, Davelaar, Jonasson, & Besner, 1977). For example, the word peace produces four neighbors: peach, pence, pease\n, and place. It is often referred to as N, and it is the more commonly used measure in studies of lexical similarity. A common finding in word naming is that words with high N are named faster than words with low N (Andrews, 1989, 1992; Mathey, 2001; Sears, Hino, & Lupker, 1999).",

            "text": "The word\u2019s orthographic body is a structural characteristic of words that correlates with word rhyme, and N and has led to the suggestion of a late locus for the N-effect. In English, a great proportion of neighbors result from changing the first letter of the word. As a consequence, high-N words tend to share their orthographic body, and in addition, this orthographic body usually rhymes. This relationship between N, orthography, and phonology introduces the possibility that N-effects might be the consequence of phonological, rather than orthographic, computation. Adelman and Brown (2007) tested this hypothesis by analyzing the results from four existing megastudies of word recognition in English (Balota et al., 2000; Balota & Spieler, 1998; Spieler & Balota, 1997; Seidenberg & Waters, 1989). They conducted a series of regression analyses in which they included phonographic neighborhood, which refers to the number of words formed by changing one letter and phoneme from a given word, as a predictor variable. Other variables included in their analysis were word frequency, orthographic neighborhood size, first phoneme, number of letters, word regularity, number of friends, number of enemies, and rime consistency ratio. The results showed a significant facilitation of number of phonographic neighbors over and above the effects of regularity and rime consistency. Number of orthographic neighbors did not reliably predict reaction times in any of the four sets analyzed (apart from a small impact in the Seidenberg and Waters\u2019s, 1989, data). Adelman and Brown (2007) concluded that neighborhood effects cannot be accounted for by orthographic processing only; instead, the conversion of print to sound is the more likely source of the effect.",

Number of syllables, like number of letters, also interacts with word frequency, with more pronounced length effects reported for multisyllabic low-frequency words (Ferrand, 2000; Jared & Seidenberg, 1990). Theoretically, length effects have been conceptualized as indicators of serial processing. Taking the dual-route model as the theoretical framework, the reported interaction between word length and frequency could be explained as the result of the rapid, parallel processing of high-frequency words via the lexical pathway (irrespective of word length) but the slow processing of low-frequency words by the same lexical route. The slowness in the lexical processing of low-frequency words makes the activity of the sublexical route more apparent, showing facilitation when short words are processed (Balota et al., 2004; Coltheart et al., 2001).",

He grouped the written representation of sounds into graphemes (letter or combination of letters equivalent to one sound) and established two types of grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences: major for those occurring with higher frequency and minor for those occurring with lower frequency. As an illustrative example of Venezky\u2019s taxonomy, the pronunciation of ea as in seal was described as a major correspondence, while the pronunciations for ea in steak or bread were minor correspondences. Adhering to Venezky\u2019s classification, Coltheart (1978) proposed a ruled-based mechanism for coding phonological information, known as the grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences (GPC) system. The application of the rules governing major correspondences, or the GPC system, allows the correct pronunciation of all the English regular words. However, a different but parallel lexical mechanism is required to allow for correct pronunciation of irregular words (those whose graphemes are converted to phonemic correspondences not embedded in the GPC system). The lexical and sublexical GPC mechanisms (also referred as routes) will produce the correct pronunciation for all regular words and nonwords. However, these two routes generate conflicting pronunciations for irregular words. The resolution of the conflict takes time, and this slows down responses. A common finding supporting the existence of these two routes for reading is that regular words are processed faster and more accurately than irregular words (Baron & Strawson, 1976; Gough & Cosky, 1977; Parkin, 1982; Stanovich & Bauer, 1978; Waters & Seidenberg, 1985).",

For example, the word body ade, as in wade, is pronounced in the same way in all similarly spelled words (e.g., bade and fade) and is, hence, described as consistent. In contrast, save is pronounced differently from have and is, therefore, an example of an inconsistent word. In Experiments 1 and 2, Glushko demonstrated that pseudowords created from words with irregular pronunciations (such as heaf from the irregular word deaf) were named slower than pseudowords based on words with regular spelling-to-sound correspondences (e.g., hean from dean). Glushko argued that the longer production latency for heaf over hean was the result of the eaf ending stemming from a group of exception words (e.g., deaf, leaf).",

Glushko argued that consistent words are named faster because the activation of neighboring nodes facilitates their processing. Cortese and Simpson (2000) and Jared (2002) also varied GPC regularity and word body consistency orthogonally in tests of word naming. Both studies indicated that consistency had an impact on production latency over and above any effects of regularity, as well as on the number of errors made by participants. These findings support the position that a hard and fast rule system might be insufficient for the conversion of words from print to sound. A rule system such as the grapheme\u2013phoneme correspondences can only split words into two halves\u2014those that follow the rules and those that violate them.",

Statistical valuations of frequency derived from corpora of written language have been commonly considered the objective measure of frequency. However, it has been observed that frequency norms generated from corpus of printed frequency might not be truly representative of the language in use (Brysbaert & New, 2009; Gernsbacher, 1984). This is because written language is edited, more diverse than spoken language, and fixed to the linguistic style of its time. Other sources of criticism come from the sample bias associated to statistical estimations. This bias is more pronounced in small corpuses where low-frequency words, in particular, lose discriminatory power (Burgress & Livesay, 1998; Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002). Brysbaert and New conducted a study looking at traditional and more contemporary frequency norms. They found that the bias for low-frequency words represents a concern only on corpuses sized below 16 million words. Brysbaert and New compared the predictive power of word frequency as obtained from six different frequency norms on word recognition times (as available from Balota et al., 2004). They showed that norms available from Internet discussion groups (Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL); Lund & Burgress, 1996) and subtitles (SUBTLEXus; Brysbaert & New, 2009) showed the highest correlations with word-processing variables.",

In order to obtain frequency ratings, participants are asked to estimate how many times they encounter and/or use a particular word. This measure of frequency is normally considered to be subjective and is often used interchangeably with the concept of word familiarity. In this study, a rated estimation of the subjective frequency/familiarity of a list of acronyms is presented along with a printed frequency measure for each acronym. Frequency corpuses tend to underrate the frequency of acronyms because they either avoid the inclusion of abbreviations (Zeno, Ivens, Millard, & Duvvuri, 1995) or are based on language samples where acronyms are scarcely represented (e.g. from subtitles SUBTLEXus). For this reason, acronyms\u2019 printed frequency was calculated using three Internet search engines (www.altavista.com; www.google.co.uk; www.bing.com), as suggested by Blair, Urland, and Ma\u2019s (2002) method. That is, each acronym was entered into the search function, and the number of hits returned was recorded as the measure of the acronym frequency. The validity of this method was provided by Blair et al. They compared frequency estimations based on two commonly used corpuses (i.e., the Ku\u010dera & Francis [1967] corpus and the Celex database [Baayen, Piepenbrock, & Gulikers, 1995]) with frequency calculations based on the number of hits returned by four Internet search engines (i.e., Alta Vista, Northern Light, Excite, and Yahoo). Frequencies from the search engines were collected at two points in time, with an interval of 6 months between them. Results showed high correlations between the frequency values provided by corpuses of written text and those generated by the search engines (e.g., Alta Vista frequencies correlated .81 with Ku\u010dera and Francis and .76 with Celex [Baayen et al., 1995]) and high test\u2013retest reliabilities (r = .92). These correlations were based in a word sample of 382 words.",

The simple threshold voice key recorded the moment at which an amplitude value exceeded a predetermined threshold, and the integrative voice key was sensitive to the amplitude and, also, to the duration of the signal. Onset complexity had two levels that were operationalized as (1) words with two-phoneme onsets (e.g., /s/ followed by /p/ or /t/, as in spat or step) and (2) words with just one phoneme onset (e.g., /s/ as in sat). Results showed that the simple threshold voice key was triggered at the onset of voicing, which did not coincide with the real word\u2019s onset, since all the words used started with the voiceless phoneme /s/.",

The procedure requires the transformation of each phonetic feature into a dummy variable that is then considered in the analyses (Balota et al., 2004; Treiman, Mullennix, Bijeljac-Babic, & Richmond-Welty, 1995). However, taking into account the phonetic features of the first phoneme of a word might not be enough, since voice key biases have been reported to emerge not only from the initial phoneme, but also from other consonants and vowels in the acoustic onset (Kessler, Treiman, & Mullennix, 2002; Rastle & Davis, 2002). Taking initial phoneme features plus complex consonant onsets into account requires adding an important number of variables (i.e., from 10 onward). These added variables do not pose a problem in multiple regression analyses comprising large number of stimuli (e.g., 2,428 words in Balota et al. [2004] and 1,329 words in Treiman et al. [1995]). However, ten or more new variables could be an excessive addition of factors in studies with a relatively small number of different stimuli.",

Semantic responses included those referring to the full term for the acronym, as well as semantic-related information (e.g., BBC\u2013television).

However, they do not show the same pattern of correlations with the number of syllables, the number of orthographic neighbors, and imageability. All three printed frequencies correlate positively with the number of letters and negatively with the number of phonemes, meaning that high-frequency acronyms tend to have more letters but fewer phonemes.

This lack of correlation is unusual in studies using common words (see Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002, 2004). This atypical relationship might reflect the fact that a number of newly introduced acronyms refer to technological devices, programs, organizations, and so forth that are becoming part of everyday live and language (e.g., DVD, GPS). The recent introduction of some of these acronyms means that they are learned late in life, despite their high frequency of appearance in print. AoA ratings showed significant and negative correlations with imageability and rated frequency, meaning that the later acquired the acronym, the lower its imageability and perceived frequency. These inverse relations of AoA with imageability and rated frequency have typically been found in studies using mainstream words (Morrison, Chappell, & Ellis, 1997; Stadthagen-Gonzalez & Davis, 2006). A linear correlation was found between rated frequencies and AoA ( r = \u2212.18, p < .05; see Table 2), suggesting that the printed frequency estimations used in the present study overrated the perceived frequency of some acronyms\u2014in particular, those at the higher end in the AoA scale. Thus, a number of late acquired acronyms appeared with greater printed than rated frequencies (e.g., PSP [play station personal], TFT [Thin Film Transition], MBA [Masters in Business Administration]).",

The particular technique used here to analyze the data is known as the multilevel or hierarchical model (Miles & Shevlin, 2001). Multilevel models are linear regressions in which variation of groups can be modeled at different levels (Gelman & Hill, 2007). For the purpose of this study, the data were structured hierarchically with a three-level hierarchy: one corresponding to the participants, and the other two to the predictor variables. One of the advantages of this model over classical regression is that it allows an examination of the predictive power of independent variables while accounting for systematic unexplained variation among the group of participants. For the purpose of all the analyses reported here, acronym-naming times were log transformed to reduce skew. The software used in all analyses was SPSS (16.0).",

The curvilinear relationships of two predictors (i.e., imageability and number of letters) with reaction times violated the regression assumption of linearity. The quadratic term of imageability and number of letters was introduced into the analysis as a procedure that tackles this problem (Kline, 2005). In these cases, variable Y (i.e., reaction times) is regressed on both X (i.e., imageability) and X\n2 (i.e., imageability2). The presence of the squared variable adds a curvature to the regression line, and its regression coefficient indicates the influence of the quadratic aspect of imageability on reaction times.",

The main effect of number of orthographic neighbors was significant only when the bigram frequency was in the analyses.

However, some correlations conflicted with what is normally found with mainstream words. For example, the negative correlations found between letter length and syllable length and, between letter length and number of phonemes show an inverse relationship between orthographic and phonological length not present in mainstream words. For the acronyms studied here, as orthographic length increased, phonological length decreased. This is possibly the result of the variety of print-to-pronunciation patterns observed in acronyms. Short acronyms tend to be pronounced naming each of their constituent letters (e.g., DVD), but long acronyms are more likely to include vowels and be pronounced following grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences (e.g., SCUBA).",

From the phonological measures of word length, only number of phonemes had an influence on reaction times. Bigram frequency affected reaction times and accuracy, while trigram frequency made a significant contribution to naming times only. Studies of standard word naming have struggled to find bigram frequency effects once other variables such as N, onsets, and rimes are taken into account (Andrews, 1992; Bowey, 1990; Strain & Herdman, 1999). The fact that a particular variable does not show an effect on a particular behavior (e.g., reaction time or accuracy) does not mean that the processes associated to that behavior are free from its influence. Although bigram frequency effects are not commonly found in measures of word-naming performance, its influence has been detected when measuring brain activity (Binder, Medler, Westbury, Liebenthal, & Buchanan, 2006; Hauk, Davis, Ford, Pulverm\u00fcller & Marslen-Wilson, 2006; Hauk, Patterson et al., 2006). The number of orthographic neighbors (N) exerted an influence in acronym-naming times (analyses with bigram frequency) and accuracy. This result can only support Andrews\u2019s (1989) proposal of an early origin for the N-effect as a product of the interaction between letter and lexical units. This is because the translation from letters to sounds in acronyms does not correspond, in the great majority of the cases, to that of the neighboring words in relation to single phonemes or rhyme units (e.g., EEG and leg, peg, beg, egg).",

The regression lines plotted in Fig. 3 showed that high-frequency unambiguous acronyms and high-frequency ambiguous typical acronyms were named faster than their low-frequency counterparts. However, high-frequency ambiguous and atypical acronyms were named slower than low-frequency ambiguous and atypical acronyms. This reversed frequency effect is interpreted as a result of the reading context. In the context of naming acronyms (pronouncing most of them by naming each letter aloud), reading aloud acronyms following grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences is slowed down because this pronunciation mechanism conflicts with a letter-by-letter naming mechanism more frequently used in this particular task context. The higher the frequency of the acronym pronounced following grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences, the greater the conflict and the time needed to resolve it. The same kind of argument can be applied to the significant interaction found between AoA and ambiguous typical acronyms. Figure 2 shows the usual difference between naming early and late acquired typical acronyms, with faster naming for early learned acronyms than for later learned acronyms. However, early learned ambiguous atypical acronyms are named much slower than late acquired ambiguous atypical acronyms. As with printed frequency, the \u201creversed\u201d AoA effect might be due to a conflict between pronunciation mechanisms. This conflict is not normally encountered, since naming acronyms is infrequent in comparison with naming mainstream words.4\n",

It might be the case that acronym reading requires a mechanism for reading in which letters are processed individually. There is a precedent for this claim in the literature concerning letter-by-letter dyslexics. As Howard (1991) noted, patients with acquired dyslexia will often name each letter of a written word in turn before producing a whole-word pronunciation. It has been argued that this strategy is used because there is an obstacle to processing the letters of a word in parallel. In cases where letter naming is preserved while whole-word recognition is impaired, it is possible to argue that there are disparate routes for the two processes. It could be that rather than this capability developing to overcome a specific deficit, the mechanism is available to all readers. In normal readers, the letter-naming rule system is applied only when it is necessary or efficient to do so, such as in acronym reading. Letter-by-letter readers may be forced to rely on this system in all instances. Further evidence for this claim could be provided in future research by using acronyms as stimuli in examinations of impaired reading performance, particularly in cases where the lexico-semantic system is specifically affected or in designs tailored to preclude lexical reading.",
