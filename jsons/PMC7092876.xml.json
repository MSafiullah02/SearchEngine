            "text": "CHIKV belongs to the genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, which encodes a 12-kb positive-sense RNA genome including two open reading frames (ORFs) [4]. One ORF encodes four nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4) that are involved in genome replication. The other ORF encodes structural proteins including capsid, E3, E2, 6 K, transframe (TF), and E1. Alphavirus TF is generated from 6 K by \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF) [5,6]. TF is not essential for virus replication, although disrupting TF production decreases virus particle release. Recently, we demonstrated that CHIKV nsP1 is palmitoylated. Mutations that prevented nsP1 palmitoylation reduced the CHIKV infection [7]. TF from Sindbis virus (SINV) was reported to be palmitoylated [8]. However, whether CHIKV TF is palmitoylated remains unexplored.",

Previously, PPIs between nonstructural proteins of CHIKV have been reported [15]. However, the complete CHIKV intraviral interactome remains to be elucidated. In this study, we constructed the CHIKV intraviral interactome based on immunoprecipitation method. CHIKV TF was identified to be palmitoylated and homo-oligomerized.

In agreement with our prediction, HAM reduced the monomeric TF size on SDS-PAGE but not 6 K, confirming the palmitoylation of TF (Fig. 4B). We next treated TF-expressing 293T cells with a palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP and analyzed the protein lysates for oligomerization of TF wild type protein or TF-C/A mutant by Western blot. 2-BP increased the higher molecular weight (MW) signal corresponding to the oligomeric TF and reduced the lower MW signal corresponding to the monomeric of TF. However, the oligomerization level of TF-C/A remained the same in the presence of 2-BP (Fig.e 3A and 4C).
