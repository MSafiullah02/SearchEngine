For example, human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the causative agents of epithelial hyperplasia of the skin and genital tract [1]. Persistent infection of HPV can result in malignant lesions, the most common being cervical cancer, which had caused an estimated 0.6 million new cases in 2018 and contributed to more than 0.3 billion deaths [2]. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the major causes of hepatitis and can progress to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually liver cancer (the seventh most common human cancer worldwide) [2]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which accounts for approximately 1.5 million deaths per year worldwide [3]. Unfortunately, for many viral illnesses, there are no effective and specific treatments. Therefore, a better understanding of how viral infections are controlled or promoted by the host may shed light on better clinical care approaches and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

The initial sensing of an invading virus by pattern recognition receptors of the host innate immune system induces the production of interferons (IFN) and other proinflammatory cytokines as a part of the early host antiviral response phase. Afterwards, both the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and B-cell production of neutralizing antibodies ultimately mounts an effective and specific antiviral response for optimal viral clearance. However, despite the essential need for viral control and clearance, the intensity of the antiviral immune response must be delicately regulated to avoid excessive inflammation and associated tissue damage during both acute and chronic viral infections [6,7].",

            "text": "Interleukin (IL)-17 was discovered in the 1990s and has since emerged as a remarkably pleiotropic cytokine that contributes in unique ways to the host immune response. IL-17 can be produced by a wide range of immune cell populations, such as Th17 cells [8], CD8+ T cells [9], \u03b3\u03b4T cells [10], natural killer (NK) cells [11], natural killer T (NKT) cells [12], mast cells [13], neutrophils [14] and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) [15]. IL-17 plays a key role in the maintenance of tissue integrity and the generation of protective immune responses to infectious microorganisms, especially at epithelial barrier sites [16]. The proinflammatory properties of IL-17 also make it a crucial mediator of inflammation and immunopathology [16]. The surprisingly diverse functions of IL-17 have made it among the more favourable immunotherapeutic target candidates for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, including cancers [17], autoimmune diseases [18] and infectious diseases [19]. Research is also being done on IL-17 in the regulation of viral infections, where it plays varied and crucial roles. Intriguingly, a body of literature indicates that while IL-17 is a critical player in host defence by substantially suppressing viral infections, it has also been strongly implicated in the promotion of viral infection and related illness. Herein, we focus on the beneficial and detrimental effects of IL-17 during viral infections, as well as infection-induced tissue pathology. We also focus on elucidating relevant mechanisms underlying these observations. In addition, we further highlight the translational significance of IL-17-targeted immunotherapies as promising therapeutic options for the treatment of viral infections and resulting tissue pathology.",

            "text": "It is well known that Th1 cells are crucial for the development of antiviral immunity against genital infection by herpes simplex virus (HSV). In brief, either CD4+ T-cell deletion or IFN-\u03b3 blockade results in significantly compromised protection against lethal HSV challenge [20], while enhanced Th1 immune responses or Th1-cytokine administration reduces both the morbidity and mortality of mice following HSV challenge [21,22]. The seminal work of Kaushic and colleagues demonstrated that IL-17 is crucial for the generation of efficient Th1 immune responses in mice following intravaginal HSV-2 infection. In their observations, IL-17 is primarily secreted by vaginal Th17 cells, which are induced through IL-1\u03b2 produced by CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) [23]. IL-17-deficient mice failed to mount a protective Th1 immune response and were more prone to genital HSV-2 challenge [23]. Interestingly, it appears that the promotion of antiviral Th1 cell immunity by IL-17 is more pronounced following HSV-2 reexposure or rechallenge in mice [24]. In IL-17A-knockout mice, the lack of IL-17A production resulted in higher viral shedding, more severe morbidity and mortality, and significantly compromised Th1 immune responses, with subsequently fewer IFN-\u03b3-expressing CD4+ tissue-resident memory T cells observed in the female genital tract [24]. In comparison, IL-17 did not play a significant role during primary HSV-2 infection [24].",

            "text": "Using a murine model of West Nile virus infection, Acharya et al. [30] found that IL-17-deficient mice exhibited a higher viral burden, as well as a lower survival rate. Both of these responses were paired with reduced CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity characterized by a lower expression of cytotoxic-mediator genes (i.e. Perforin-1, Granzymes and FasL) [30]. Of note, treatment with recombinant IL-17 significantly recovered the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells from IL-17-deficient mice [30]. It appears that the effect of IL-17 on CD8+ T cells is direct, as the expression of cytotoxic-mediator genes of sorted splenic CD8+ T cells could be directly induced by addition of recombinant IL-17 in vitro [30]. Consistent with this finding, Hou et al. [31,32] found that IL-17 was crucial for priming hepatic CD8+ T cells since IL-17 neutralization or IL-17RA-knockout resulted in significantly decreased CTL counts and compromised CTL effector functions in adenovirus-infected mice. In their subsequent work, they also showed that IL-17 production was IL-7 dependent, as IL-7R blockade resulted in a markedly decreased number of IL-17-producing cells following viral infection [31]. In addition, potent type I IFN signalling induced by adenovirus infection was primarily responsible for hepatic IL-7 induction [31]. IL-17 was also shown to be partly responsible for the clustering and activation of CD8+ T cells in the spleen following vaccinia virus infection, thereby contributing to host defence against viral infection [33].",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence reveals that B cells are critically involved in the host's control of multiple viruses [41]. The protective role of B cells during viral infection is largely mediated through an effective humoral immune response that includes both the production of natural antibodies at infection onset and isotype-switched virus-specific antibodies at a later phase of infection [42\u201345]. Although several studies have investigated the role of IL-17 in the induction and maintenance of effective humoral immunity in various settings [46\u201349], studies regarding the effect of IL-17 in modulating antiviral B-cell activities have been very limited. In 2011, the pioneering work of Wang et al. [50] showed that following H5N1 influenza virus infection, IL-17 is critical for recruitment of B cells to the lung. This phenomenon is partly mediated through the induction of CXC-chemokine ligand (CXCL)13, a potent chemoattractant for CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR)5-expressing B cells [50] (figure 1a). Further work by the same group revealed an intriguing function of IL-17 to promote the migration and differentiation of B1a cells, a subset of B cells that are the major source of natural immunoglobulin (Ig)M [42,51]. During H1N1 influenza infection, the deficiency of IL-17 was shown to result in significantly compromised B1a cell-derived antibody production in the lung that coincided with defective viral clearance. Mechanistically, IL-17 was shown to be essential for the induction of B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein (Blimp)-1 expression and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) activation of pulmonary B1a cells. This response leads to the plasmacytic differentiation of these cells and eventually the production of natural IgM [42] (figure 1a).\n",

While the mechanisms for overcoming multiple viral infections by Tc1 cells have been clearly demonstrated, mechanisms for the suppression of viral infections by Tc17 cells have not been fully elucidated. In response to being challenged with lethal doses of influenza infection, the number of Tc17 cells in the lung increased sharply and was shown to play a host beneficial role, since the neutralization of IL-17 resulted in higher morbidity and mortality of the infected mice [53]. However, the majority of Tc17 cells displayed no cytolytic activity, while the protection conferred by these cells coincided with an influx of neutrophils into the lung [53]. Consistent with this observation, following the infection of HSV in mice, IL-17 appears to be responsible for reduced viral load partly by strengthening inflammatory responses that promote neutrophil migration into the lung [54]. Following vaccinia virus infection, adoptively transferred Tc17 cells can acquire strong cytotoxic potential in vivo, as shown by their increased FasL expression levels that correlate with effective viral clearance [55].",

These changes result in increased microbial translocation from the GI tract, further contributing to the systemic dissemination of microbial constituents, pathological immune activation and progressive disease development [61]. In an effort to characterize immunological alterations in the GI tract during SIV infection, Klatt et al. [62] found that damaged epithelial integrity was associated with markedly reduced IL-17 production. Further investigation revealed a loss of IL-17-producing cells due to the depletion of CD103+ DCs, which have been shown to both express genes favourable to IL-17 production and induce the differentiation of IL-17A- and RORc-expressing cells upon coculture with naive T cells in vitro [62]. Consistent with this finding, Reeves et al. [63] demonstrated that a subset of mucosal NKp44+ NK cells (which secrete IL-17A and IL-22 and are involved in the maintenance of gut integrity) were depleted and exhibited an aberrant functional profile of elevated IFN-\u03b3 production and decreased IL-17A production. This phenomenon is believed to be caused by increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 production after SIV infection [63].",

Huang et al. [64] found that neonates failed to develop an IL-17 response during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and exhibited more severe lung inflammation and pathology than adult mice. To examine the function of IL-17 during RSV infection, they found that exogenous IL-17 administration to RSV-challenged neonatal mice led to a decreased lung inflammation profile, while IL-17 neutralization in adults caused increased inflammation and airway mucus [64]. Consistent with this finding, in SIV-infected rhesus macaques, the percentage of mucosal Th17 cells is negatively correlated with plasma SIV levels, with Th1 cell number predominating over that of Th17 cells in highly viraemic animals [40]. Moreover, during and after antiretroviral therapy, Th17 cell function and frequency were negatively associated with both systemic inflammation and virus persistence [65]. Similar findings were obtained for Tc17 cells in HIV patients receiving antiretroviral therapies [66]. In these patients, persistent immune activation was still evident, despite effective viral suppression, and was associated with a low frequency of CD161+ Tc17 cells exhibiting severely compromised IL-17 secretory ability. Importantly, this Tc17 cell dysfunction could be partially recovered after anti-inflammatory agent treatment [66].",

Similarly, regulatory T (Treg) cells have been suggested to play a protective role in promoting lung tissue integrity and repair through IL-33-mediated production of the growth factor amphiregulin [69\u201372]. Guo et al. [73] reported that IL-17-producing \u03b3\u03b4T cells functioned as crucial immune regulators following the infection of neonatal mice with influenza. Although the activation of this cell subset did not affect viral clearance or IFN-\u03b3 production, IL-17 secretion stimulated IL-33 production by lung epithelial cells. In turn, IL-33 production further facilitated lung infiltration of ILC2s and Treg cells, both of which are important sources of amphiregulin that is necessary for tissue repair (figure 1b). Importantly, neonates lacking IL-17-producing \u03b3\u03b4T cells or IL-33 production showed more serious morbidity and mortality. This response is of particular interest due to previously observed influenza-affected children profiles. In these children, the concentrations of IL-17A, IL-33 and amphiregulin in the nasal aspirates were shown to correlate with one another, with higher IL-17 levels correlating with better clinical prognosis [73].",

[74,75] found that IL-17 plays a vital role in protecting permissive cells from virus-induced apoptosis, as well as through the desensitization of CTL killing of these cells. The underlying mechanism involves the induction of antiapoptotic proteins (i.e. Bcl-xL and Bcl-2) by IL-17, consistent with the reported growth-promoting effect of this cytokine in several other models [78,79]. Nevertheless, in this model, the development of pathogenic IL-17-producing cells is driven by the production of excessively high levels of IL-6 following viral infection. The concerted action of these two cytokines suppresses apoptosis of the permissive cells more efficiently than either cytokine alone to ultimately support viral persistence.",

For example, in the presence of Th17-polarizing cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-23 and TGF-\u03b2, HIV infection of T cells is significantly increased in vitro [39,55]. Meanwhile, during acute HIV/SIV infection in vivo, Th17 cells are rapidly and preferentially depleted from gut-associated lymphoid tissues as a typical form of HIV pathology [29,55]. The mechanisms underlying the preferential infection of Th17 cells by HIV/SIV may involve a higher expression of HIV-binding proteins CXCR4, \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, C\u2013C chemokine receptor type (CCR)5 and CD4, as well as a lower expression of HIV-inhibitory chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b2 by these cells [29,78]. Recently, the work of Christensen-Quick and colleagues [39] has shed more light on this phenomenon. In their observations, Th17 cells produce more viral capsid protein following HIV infection and could even support infection with replication-defective HIV vectors possessing pseudotype envelopes [39]. In addition, Th17 cells were shown to express lower levels of HIV-suppressive RNase 6, a key determinant for enhanced intracellular viral replication and production in these cells [39].",

During RSV infection, it has been observed that increased IL-17 level is usually associated with more severe tissue pathology and higher mortality after infection [89,90]. Mechanistically, IL-17 can boost the production of several chemokines (i.e. IL-8 and CXCL1) by airway epithelial cells that lead to the excessive accumulation of neutrophils, thereby generating a strong inflammatory response and thus leading to airway tissue injury [77,90,91]. Accordingly, IL-17 gene deletion or IL-17 protein blockade can significantly decrease the extent of local inflammation and ameliorate tissue damage [77,92,93]. Consistent with these findings, a significant increase in IL-17 level has been observed during human influenza infection, as well as in relevant mouse models [94]. Intriguingly, mucosal pre-exposure to Th17-inducing adjuvants before influenza infection results in increased infiltration of neutrophils, more severe lung inflammation and increased morbidity upon subsequent infection [95]. In addition, IL-17RA, which is a common receptor of IL-17A and IL-17F, is critical for neutrophil migration and lung injury after influenza infection [96].",

[12] found that the increased morbidity and mortality of aged mice was caused by a rapid increase in IL-17 level (primarily produced by hepatic NKT cells) during the infection. This stimulated the activation of hepatic neutrophils that subsequently contributed to hepatocyte necrosis and virus-induced death [12]. In addition, serum IL-17 levels have been observed to be significantly higher in patients infected by dengue virus. Notably, IL-17 appears to be involved in more severe cases of infection, although the exact role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of dengue virus infection remains unknown [97].This finding was corroborated by an independent investigation, which confirmed that the increased levels of IL-17, mostly produced by hepatic \u03b3\u03b4T cells, were accompanied by neutrophil accumulation in the liver that contributed to disease progression during dengue virus infection of mice [98]. Importantly, IL-17R deletion or IL-17-neutralizing monoclonal antibody treatment resulted in substantial protection of the infected mice from virus-induced tissue pathology and mortality [98]. Consistent with these findings, increased IL-17-associated tissue damage has also been highlighted in patients with HIV infection. In these patients, the percentage of IL-17-producing cells is significantly higher than in non-infected subjects, with IL-17 level positively correlating with markers of neutrophil activation, another typical feature of HIV pathology [99].",

            "text": "Fibrosis is a consequence of chronic injury of a target tissue characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and a typical feature of many chronic diseases [100,101]. The progression of fibrosis usually results in the distortion of normal target tissue architecture via pathologic tissue remodelling and fibrous scar formation. This in turn creates fundamental changes in organ function and can even result in organ failure [100,101]. Viruses may induce tissue damage by promoting fibrosis development, as is particularly true for chronic HBV or HCV infections, whereby inappropriate activation of IL-17-producing cells plays a critical role in maintaining fibrogenic pathways and disease progression. Abundant evidence suggests a potential correlation between IL-17-producing cells (i.e. Tc17 cells or Th17 cells) or IL-17 levels and a more severe disease stage of HBV or HCV progression [102\u2013106], while mechanistic studies have shown a causal link between IL-17 production and the development of liver fibrosis. For example, IL-17 expression has been observed to be specifically localized to portal areas and fibrotic septa in patients with HBV or HCV infection [107]. Interestingly, most of these IL-17-expressing cells are neutrophils, with the number of these cells showing a strong positive correlation with liver fibrosis stage [107]. More specifically, the work of Wang et al. [108] has highlighted a critical role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the induction of liver damage after HBV infection. In HBV-infected patients, IL-23 production by DCs and macrophages stimulates the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells, the primary source of IL-17 in HBV-infected livers. At the same time, IL-17R is highly expressed on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), one of the most important collagen-producing cell types in the liver (figure 2). Another study found that the production of Th17 differentiation cytokines (i.e. TGF-\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-21) by hepatic DCs could also be stimulated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) released from HCV-infected hepatocytes, with substantial levels of TSLP detected in fibrotic liver tissues of patients with chronic HCV [109] (figure 2).\n",

Their results demonstrated that mice after syngeneic bone marrow reconstitution and concurrent gammaherpesvirus infection exhibited skewed differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells. By producing IL-17A, these Th17 cells directly induced the activation and production of ECM by lung mesenchymal cells [110]. Mechanistically, deficiency of Notch ligand DLL4 in lung CD103+ and CD11b+ DCs was shown to be responsible for the pathologic Th17 responses [111]. Notably, restored Notch signalling or IL-17 neutralization attenuated fibrosis and pneumonitis in these mice [110,111].",

The lineage determination of naive CD4+ T cells is governed predominantly by the cytokines present in the microenvironment [113]. Intriguingly, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 is not only indispensable for the development of iTregs but is also a potent inducer of Th17 cells, with the balance between Treg and Th17 cell differentiation depending on the overall cytokine milieu. More specifically, a lower concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in the presence of several other proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-21 and IL-23, may promote a Th17 response, while a higher concentration in combination with IL-2 appears to promote an iTreg response [114,115]. Therefore, the abnormal expansion of Th17 cells may potentially antagonize the development of Treg cells, resulting in insufficient immune regulation, persistent immune activation and consequently greater degrees of immunopathology, all of which are particularly relevant to several types of viral infections.",

Th17 frequency has been shown to positively correlate with levels of liver stiffness, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin levels and prothrombin time, while Treg cell frequency negatively correlated with liver stiffness [117,119,120].

Consistent with this finding, Gao et al. [123] using a rat model of RSV bronchiolitis observed higher Th17 cell percentages and IL-17 and IL-23 concentrations but significantly reduced overall Treg cell percentages and IL-10 levels. In other work, Li et al. observed a significantly reduced percentage of Treg cells in children suffering from RSV infection, with concomitantly decreased IL-10 levels compared with healthy controls. In addition, the concentration of IL-17 and the frequency of Th17 cells were significantly increased in these patients [124]. When galectin-9, a specific inhibitor of Th1 and Th17 immune responses, was administered to RSV-infected mice, significantly decreased viral load and diminished lung pathology were observed that mainly resulted from the suppression of both Th17 differentiation and the induction of Treg cell expansion [125]. Similarly, in a murine model of human metapneumovirus infection, IL-17 deletion resulted in an increased percentage of lung-infiltrating Treg cells and reduction in Th1 and Th2 cells in the lung [93].",

            "text": "Patients with RSV infection usually develop severe bronchiolitis that is ascribed to a potent Th2 immune response in the respiratory tract. This notion is supported by the finding that IL-4 and IL-4 receptor \u03b1 polymorphisms are associated with severe RSV bronchiolitis [126], and high levels of both Th2-associated transcriptional factors and cytokines have been detected in patients with more severe manifestations [127\u2013131]. Mounting evidence has shown that IL-17A can induce the differentiation of Th2 cells [132,133], as is observed in RSV infections. Several murine models have shown that IL-17 and IL-13 are usually simultaneously produced after RSV infection, implicating a concurrent Th17 and Th2 response. The underlying molecular mechanisms have implicated a critical role for the IL-27/STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) signalling pathway in enhancing Th17 and Th2 responses, as both IL-27 receptor-deficient and STAT1-deficient mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of IL-17 and Th2-associated cytokines [92,134]. Importantly, IL-17 neutralization in both mouse models resulted in improved disease outcomes and reduced Th2 cytokine production, as observed in several other independent studies [77,122,135]. Intriguingly, Monick et al. [136] observed that IL-4 and IL-13 could potently stimulate the production of Th2 cell chemoattractant CCL17 by lung epithelial cells after RSV infection, suggesting a positive feedback loop for Th2 cell generation after RSV infection.",

            "text": "Although IL-17R is expressed universally in the body, the subsequent signalling pathway mediated by IL-17/IL-17R relies greatly on both the specific cell types present and on the tissue microenvironment. For example, IL-17 stimulates the expression of Csf2 (encoding granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)) in NK cells to foster the differentiation and proliferation of Kupffer cells [74,75], thus endowing this cell subset with competence to control systemic candidiasis. Alternatively, in lung epithelium, IL-17/IL-17R signalling stimulates the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and induces the expression of IL-8, IL-6 and CXCL5 to facilitate neutrophil recruitment [140,141]. In yet another scenario involving intestinal epithelial cells, IL-17 signalling through an Act-1 pathway induces the production of occludin [76] and mucin [142], which are crucial for maintenance of gut tissue integrity. Moreover, in the liver IL-17 can directly activate the STAT3 signalling of HSCs to induce the production of collagen type I, thus contributing to hepatic fibrosis [74], while also exhibiting direct mitogenic stimulation of hepatocytes and liver progenitor cells to promote their proliferation [143,144]. However, despite their IL-17R expression, liver endothelial cells do not respond to IL-17 stimulation [74]. Moreover, IL-17 can stimulate the proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of bone mesenchymal progenitor cells to promote bone formation after injury [145]. Cell type- and tissue microenvironment-dependent IL-17/IL-17R signalling pathways may hold clues to understanding the diverse functions of IL-17.",

            "text": "In most viral infections, tissue inflammation is not driven by IL-17 alone, but by the concerted actions of IL-17 and many other proinflammatory and immunoregulatory signals. Thus, the final immunological response and subsequent severity of viral infections are highly dependent on the collective effect of these signals, a view that may explain the protective and pathogenic functions of IL-17 in different settings of inflammation. Th17 and Treg cells are both activated and function in opposition regarding RSV clinical pathology and viral clearance. Th17 cells have been reported to stimulate the chemotaxis of neutrophils into the infected lungs [77,90,91], induce a Th2 skewed immune response [77,122,135] and dampen CTL activity through negative regulation of effector cytokines and cytolytic-associated gene expression [77]. Conversely, Treg cells are involved in both inhibition of excessive immune responses and promotion of the early recruitment of virus-specific CD8+ T cells [146,147]. Thus, a delicate balance of Th17/Treg ratio is crucial to fine-tune the inflammatory response in the lung after RSV infection. If this balance is maintained properly, the pathologic effects of IL-17 can be held in check, and its beneficial functions (i.e. maintaining the integrity of lung epithelium) will far outweigh its pathogenic effects. In fact, in addition to RSV infections, this phenomenon has also been demonstrated in many other viral and non-viral infections [7,148,149] and even in several non-infectious diseases [150].",

On the other hand, Tc17 cells, which show no such attributes and which express FasL, are involved in inhibiting the pathogenic inflammation brought about by HIV infection [55,66,79]. Similarly, following influenza infection of the lung, the presence of Th17 cells exacerbates pathology, while the number of Tc17 cells is negatively associated with morbidity and mortality [53,95]. In comparison, IL-17A-producing \u03b3\u03b4T cells in the lung can upregulate expression of IL-33 and amphiregulin, thereby promoting lung repair following influenza infection [73]. Thus, the diverse functions of IL-17 in viral infections may be attributed to the unique effector functions of different IL-17-producing cell subsets.",

            "text": "Leflunomide is an immunosuppressive drug that inhibits mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, blocking de novo pyrimidine synthesis and cell proliferation particularly in activated lymphocytes [3,142]. In addition, higher concentrations of leflunomide may also inhibit protein kinase activity and the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway in B and T lymphocytes [4,151]. In fact, leflunomide has shown effective antiviral activity towards cytomegalovirus [7], herpesvirus [8,10] and HIV-1 [9] and has also been used for treatment of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy [15]. Although the detailed mechanisms underlying its antiviral effects are not completely understood, accumulating evidence indicates that suppression of IL-17 production may be partly involved. For instance, treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes with leflunomide resulted in the activation of these cells that was accompanied by decreased production of IL-17 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, two cytokines that usually functionally synergize to initiate proinflammatory responses [11]. In addition, A771726, an active leflunomide metabolite, significantly inhibited the production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, two crucial stimulators for the differentiation of IL-17-producing cells [13]. Meanwhile, murine-based in vivo evidence has confirmed that A771726 treatment resulted in attenuated STAT3 activity in CD4+ T cells and reduced Th17 cell numbers [14]. Until now, the antiviral effect of leflunomide has not been evaluated in clinical trials in patients with viral infections, but its suppressive effect on IL-17 production has already been tested in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [152]. Notably, leflunomide\u2013methotrexate combination therapy in these patients significantly decreased circulating Th17 cells and the plasma levels of IL-17 and was associated with ameliorated RA symptoms [152].",

A wide range of agents has been tested for therapeutic efficacy in treating fibrosis by targeting IL-17 in these patients. Vitamin D has been shown to suppress the differentiation and expansion of Th17 cells and to promote Treg cell differentiation [153]. In patients with chronic HBV or HCV, vitamin D level negatively correlated with the severity of liver fibrosis, viral load and adverse clinical outcomes [16\u201318,154]. In patients with chronic HCV or decompensated liver cirrhosis, vitamin D supplementation significantly alleviated liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, improved disease progression and resulted in higher survival rates [155\u2013157]. Rapamycin is another agent that reduces liver fibrosis by antagonizing the effect of IL-17 through possible abrogation of the IL-6-induced Th17 response during acute-on-CHB liver failure [158]. Meanwhile, other studies have shown that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation also shows efficacy in ameliorating liver fibrosis and improving liver function in patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis, with the modulation of Treg/Th17 balance partly accounting for the beneficial effect in these patients [159,160].",

These features make it difficult to evaluate whether the benefits of a given targeted therapy would outweigh the potential risks, thus greatly hindering the application of IL-17-targeted therapies. However, in certain cases, targeting of the downstream signalling in lieu of direct manipulation of IL-17 may avoid unnecessary side effects and serve as an effective alternative therapeutic strategy in the future [155].

Several agents that can downregulate IL-17 activities can effectively suppress certain types of viral infections and limit tissue pathology.
