            "text": "Abstract\u00d0Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C proteinase is a picornaviral cysteine proteinase that is essential for cleavage of the initially synthesized viral polyprotein precursor to mature fragments and is therefore required for viral replication in vivo. Since the enzyme generally recognizes peptide substrates with l-glutamine at the P 1 site, four types of analogues having an azaglutamine residue were chemically synthesized: hydrazo-o-nitrophenylsulfenamides A (e.g. 16); frame-shifted hydrazo-o-nitrophenylsulfenamides B (e.g. 25\u00b128); the azaglutamine sulfonamides C (e.g. 7, 8, 11, 12); and haloacetyl azaglutamine analogues 2 and 3. Testing of these compounds for inhibition of the HAV 3C proteinase employed a C24S mutant in which the non-essential surface cysteine was replaced with serine and which displays identical catalytic parameters to the wild-type enzyme. Sulfenamide 16 (type A) showed no sig-ni\u00aecant inhibition. Sulfenamide 27 (type B) had an IC 50 of ca 100 mM and gave time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme due to disul\u00aede bond formation with the active site cysteine thiol, as demonstrated by electrospray mass spectrometry. Sulfonamide 8 (type C) was a weak competitive inhibitor with an IC 50 of approximately 75 mM. The haloacetyl azaglutamine analogues 2 and 3 were time-dependent irreversible inactivators of HAV 3C proteinase with rate constants k obs /[I] of 680 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 and 870 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 , respectively, and were shown to alkylate the active site thiol. #",

            "text": "The family of picornaviruses has more than 200 known members, divided into six genera, and contains pathogens such as poliovirus, human rhinovirus (HRV), encephalornyocarditis virus, foot and mouth disease virus and hepatitis A virus (HAV). 1\u00b14 These viruses possess a positive single-stranded RNA genome whose translation in mammalian cells produces a large protein product. The co-and post-translational processing of this initial polyprotein relies on highly speci\u00aec and organized cleavage by viral cysteine proteinases, which are attractive targets for development of therapeutic agents. 4,5 Among these, the 3C cysteine proteinases have been the subject of extensive structural investigation, with crystal structures reported for HAV 3C, 6, 7 HRV 3C, 8 and poliovirus 3C proteins. 9 Analogous 3C proteinases have also been detected in human and avian coronaviruses. 10, 11 These essential viral enzymes are especially appealing as targets for pharmaceutical intervention because their unique active site geometry 1 makes them highly speci\u00aec in their choice of substrates and cleavage sites that are absent in non-infected mammalian cells. In addition, the active site residues appear to be relatively invariant in rhinovirus, where large numbers of serotypes (>100) make vaccine development dicult. 12 Structurally the 3C proteinases have topologies that resemble the two domain b-barrel fold of the chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases. 1,5\u00b18 The active site cysteine (Cys-172 in HAV 3C) is in close proximity to a histidine residue (His-44 in HAV 3C) that acts as a general base to form the nucleophilic thiolate anion. Substrate recognition, by analogy to the chymotrypsin family, is believed to involve anti-parallel binding of the backbone of the peptide to the proteinase and the interaction of the side chains with the enzyme in several key subsites. Hydrogen-bonding between the carbonyl oxygen of the side chain of the P 1 glutamine of the substrate (or peptidic inhibitor) and a histidine at the S 1 subsite (His-191 in HAV 3C) is probably one of the key recognition events (1, 5\u00b18). The wild type HAV 3C has 219 amino acids with a molecular weight of 24 kilodaltons and exists as an active monomer. For peptide substrates mimicking the 2B/2C junction of the large precursor polyprotein, the k cat of this enzyme is typically about 1.8 s \u00c01 with a K m of 2.1 mM at a pH of 7.5. 5 In the search for therapeutic leads, enzyme inhibition studies on HAV 3C and HRV 3C proteins have employed a large variety of compounds, including peptide aldehydes, 13\u00b115 peptide\u00afuoromethyl ketones, 16 b-lactams, 17 isatins, 18 homophthalimides, 19 vinylogous esters and sulfones, 12, 20, 21 and halomethyl carbonyl compounds. 22, 23 Some of these compounds do show in vitro antiviral activity in cell culture, 12,15,16,18\u00b121 but toxicity can be a problem for substances that are generally reactive with thiols. 18 In the present study we examine a number of sulfurcontaining azaglutamine derivatives as potential inhibitors of HAV 3C proteinase. Incorporation of hydrazino functionality into peptide backbones (azapeptides) is well-established for generation of proteinase inhibitors, 24, 25 including cysteine proteinases. 26 Recently such analogues have been shown to act as active site titrants for cysteine proteinase, 27 and certain symmetrical bishydrazides are extremely potent nanomolar inhibitors of cathepsin K, a cysteine proteinase involved in boneremodeling. 28, 29 In one study on HRV 3C proteinase, an N-bromoacetyl azaglutamine dipeptide analogue 1 was shown to have an IC 50 of approximately 48 nM and to be a time-dependent irreversible inactivator with a k inact /K i value >2500 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 . 22 However, in this case the inhibitory activity depends on the highly reactive bromoacetyl moiety, which is likely to react non-speci-\u00aecally with a variety of thiols present in mammalian cells. The amide character of sulfenamides and the use of aryl sulfenamides as amino acid protecting groups which are removable by thiols under acidic conditions (Scheme 1), 30\u00b132 suggested that such functionality could display suciently low intrinsic reactivity and still form a disul\u00aede with the active site thiol (Cys-172) of HAV 3C cysteine proteinase. Thus sulfenamide azaglutamine analogues of type A and B, as well as sulfonamide derivatives C, were synthesized and investigated for inhibition of this enzyme. Although the sulfonamides C would not be expected to react with the active site cysteine, they have some potential to bind to active site residues, and they also provide a new sulfur-containing aza analogue motif for investigation. The haloacetyl azaglutamine analogues 2 and 3 were also prepared for comparison. In each case the side chain amide functionality bears two methyls since such groups are wellaccepted by the HAV 3C enzyme and hinder interactions with possible reactive intermediates, especially at the P 1 carbonyl site. 13, 16, 33 Results and Discussion Synthesis and testing of peptidosulfonamides C Examination of structure C indicates that condensation of the known a-bromoketone 4 34,35 with the anion derived from sulfonamide 5 or 6 of b-alanine dimethylamide using the procedure of Jones 36 would aord the dipeptide analogues 7 or 8, respectively (Scheme 2). The required sulfonamides are readily available by deprotection of N-Boc-b-alanine dimethylamide 37 followed by reaction with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride. As expected, the condensation 36 with the bromoketone proceeds readily, and can be followed by hydrogenolysis to remove the Cbz group in quantitative yield and form the corresponding amino compounds 9 and 10. Studies on sequence recognition by HAV 3C proteinase using model peptides suggests that the P 4 residue should be a hydrophobic amino acid such as l-leucine, and that the P 2 and P 3 residues can be l-alanine. 38 This idea is supported by Scheme 1. inhibition of the enzyme at nanomolar levels by aldehyde and\u00afuoromethylketone peptide analogues that have such sequences. 13, 16 Thus coupling of 9 or 10 to Nacetyl-l-leucinyl-l-alanine proceeds readily with ethyl chloroformate to generate the target tetrapeptide azaglutamine sulfonamide derivatives 11 and 12.",

Not only is there no detectable reaction with the inhibitor, but the level of competitive binding at the active site is also very low. Presumably the aromatic sulfenamide moiety is too bulky to be easily accommodated in the enzyme site which binds the P 1 H substrate residue.

However, these substances still give only modest levels of inhibition with IC 50 values of 0.4 to 0.5 mM, with the exception of the tetrapeptide analogue 27, which has an initial IC 50 of ca 100 mM. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the C24S HAV 3C enzyme inhibited with 27 for a prolonged period (!3 h) does show formation of an enzyme-nitrophenyl disul\u00aede, with the protein molecular ion peak shifting to higher mass by 1541 units (\u00c0H+C 6 H 4 NO 2 S). The relatively poor competition with substrate may again be due to unfavorable interactions of the aromatic portion of the inhibitor with the enzyme active site. Although the sulfenamide azapeptides are not as potent inhibitors of HAV 3C proteinase as the peptidic aldehydes 13\u00b115 or\u00afuoromethyl ketone, 16 they represent new structural types that are reasonably accessible and stable, and may be useful for inhibition of other cysteine proteinases.

Electrospray mass spectrometry of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes show addition of 470 mass units to the molecular ion and suggest that in each case there is displacement of halogen by the active site thiol of Cys-172. This is in accord with the reaction of HAV 3C with a tetrapeptide\u00afuoromethyl ketone which has been studied by NMR spectrometry, 16 as well as with the displacement of halogen from iodoacetyl peptides by the active site thiol. 23, 40 Our compounds are somewhat less active against the HAV 3C enzyme than 1 is with the HRV 3C proteinase (k inact / K i value>2500 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 ). 22 The reasons for this are uncertain, but most likely re\u00afect dierences between the proximal subsite interactions (P 1 and P 2 ) between the two enzymes with their cognate inhibitors. Possibly the presence of two methyl groups in the glutamine analogue side chain also has some eect. Moreover, it is clear that recognition of the peptide moiety in inhibitors 2 and 3 is crucial because the inherently more reactive compound, N-iodoacetamide, has a second order rate constant for inactivation of only about 3.1 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 . 23 In conclusion, the present work provides synthetic access to four types of aza amino acid peptide analogues. Although some show no binding (structural type A) or only weak initial inhibitory activity (structural types B and C) toward the hepatitis A virus 3C proteinase, the haloacetyl azaglutamine tetrapeptides 2 and 3 as well as the sulfenamide azaglutamine derivative 27 irreversibly react with the active site thiol (Cys-172). It is not unreasonable to expect that such substrate analogues may be more potent and useful for other types of cysteine proteinases.
