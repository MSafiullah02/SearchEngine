            "text": "In the current context of rapid anthropogenically induced landscape modification across primate habitat countries, improving our knowledge about the capacity of primates to adapt is crucial [Corlett, 2011]. As anthropogenic activities cause the proportion of secondary forests to increase at the expense of primary forests, primate habitats are facing structural and dynamic changes [Pan et al., 2011], which can affect forest composition and species abundance [Wright, 2005]. As a consequence, most primate species are forced to cope with large shifts in ecological conditions and associated food resources [Fahrig, 2003; Fischer & Lindenmayer, 2007; Marsh et al., 2013]. An increasing number of studies are addressing the impact of habitat fragmentation on primates [reviewed in Marsh & Chapman, 2013], demonstrating, in feeding ecology, varying dietary adjustments such as reduced frugivory [Cercopithecus cephus and nictitans: Tutin, 1999], food diversification [Ateles geoffroyi: Chaves & Stoner, 2012], increased reliance on low\u2010quality food items [Eulemur collaris: Donati et al., 2011], or on fallback resources [Propithecus diadema: Irwin 2008; Irwin et al., 2014; Pan troglodytes: Chancellor et al., 2012] and even incorporation of human cultivated items in the diet [Pan troglodytes: Chancellor et al., 2012; McLennan 2013]. Studying feeding ecology in fragments provides the opportunity to examine the plasticity of primate foraging behaviour [Boyle & Smith, 2010b; Chancellor et al., 2012] and to gain a better understanding of the resilience of primates living in these environments [Marsh & Chapman, 2013]. In addition, such studies are essential to formulate more species\u2010specific conservation measures [Boyle & Smith, 2010a;Chapman et al., 2007; Marsh, 2003; Marsh & Chapman, 2013; Onderdonk & Chapman, 2000].",

            "text": "Bonobos, like chimpanzees, may be particularly vulnerable to fragmented environments and shifts in ecological conditions because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Indeed, both species are known to maintain their frugivorous habits even in periods of fruit scarcity [White & Lanjouw, 1992; Wrangham et al., 1998], through various adaptive responses such as: (i) flexibility in ranging and grouping patterns according to the spatio\u2010temporal fluctuations of food patches [chimpanzee: Hashimoto et al., 2003; Itoh & Nishida, 2007; Lehmann et al., 2007; bonobos: Mulavwa et al., 2008], (ii) increase in the types of habitats used when fruit availability is low [chimpanzee: Basabose, 2005; Chancellor et al., 2012; bonobos: Mulavwa et al., 2010] and, (iii) for chimpanzees, a shift to consumption of fallback foods of lower quality, but which are more abundant [Conklin\u2010Brittain et al., 1998; Watts et al., 2012; Wrangham et al., 1991]. Since habitat fragmentation may lead to even more pronounced periods of fruit scarcity, studying the effect of fragmentation on feeding ecology is essential but still limited for chimpanzees [Chancellor et al., 2012; McLennan, 2013; Tutin, 1999] and almost unknown for bonobos [but see Thompson, 1997]. The discovery of bonobos also inhabiting fragmented environments, i.e., in forest\u2010savannah mosaics, was only made in the late 1990s. This particular bonobo habitat has still received very little attention [Serckx, 2014; Thompson, 1997, 2001] although it is a particularly interesting place in which to study bonobo dietary plasticity, given its large spatio\u2010temporal variation in resource availability [Serckx et al., 2014].",

            "text": "Identifying the fallback foods (FBF) of primates living in fragmented environments is important because their exploitation may allow primates to subsist in higher densities than otherwise possible [Marshall et al., 2009]. In contrast to preferred foods that are consumed disproportionately relative to their abundance in the habitat [Marshall & Wrangham, 2007], FBFs are defined as the resources consumed when the abundance of preferred foods decline [Harrison & Marshall, 2011; Marshall & Wrangham, 2007; Marshall et al., 2009]. FBFs are also typically lower in energy than preferred foods [Conklin\u2010Brittain et al., 1998; Doran\u2010Sheehy et al., 2009; Irwin et al., 2014; Wrangham et al., 1998]. Two major publications presented an overview of the topic of fallback foods. Authors pointed out that we should distinguish between \u201cstaple\u201d and \u201cfiller\u201d FBFs because their roles differ in the diet and they have distinct evolutionary effects [Lambert, 2007; Marshall & Wrangham, 2007]. Staple FBFs are available and consumed throughout the year, may seasonally constitute up to 100% of the diet at a given time and are typically low\u2010quality foods. Filler FBFs never constitute 100% of the diet, may be completely avoided when preferred foods are available but are usually high\u2010quality items. Chimpanzees typically use FBFs as filler foods [Harrison & Marshall, 2011; Lambert, 2007; Marshall & Wrangham, 2007], with variation in the types of the FBFs across sites [figs: Wrangham et al., 1993; insects: Yamagiwa & Basabose, 2009; bark cambium: Chancellor et al., 2012]. However, the classification of bonobos as staple or filler FBF consumers remains unclear because their FBFs have not yet been well identified [Harrison & Marshall, 2011; Marshall et al., 2009; Yamagiwa & Basabose, 2009]. Some studies have shown that bonobos switch to terrestrial herbaceous vegetation (THV) during times of fruit shortage [Conklin\u2010Brittain et al., 2001], but bonobos consumed THV of high quality [Malenky & Wrangham, 1994], which makes their classification as FBFs ambiguous [Marshall et al., 2009]. Similarly, figs were reported to be more intensively consumed when the availability of other fruits decline [Hohmann et al., 2006], but it is still unclear whether figs represent FBFs for bonobos or not [Harrison & Marshall, 2011]. Harrison and Marshall [2011] concluded that bonobo consumption of FBFs is either very high or very low and that we need detailed comparisons of potential FBF use versus availability of preferred foods to define in which category of FBF consumers we should classify bonobos. Since studies have suggested that filler and staple FBFs have different effects on ape socio\u2010ecology (i.e., the abundance of FBFs will influence primate carrying capacity in its habitat and thus the maximal group size as well as group cohesion, with cascading effects on social dynamics) [Marshall & Wrangham, 2007], identifying the bonobo fallback strategy might be important to improve our understanding of the differences in the evolution of socio\u2010ecology within the African Apes.",

WWF trackers who daily followed the bonobos for the purpose of habituation located nesting sites. After collection, we stored the feces in plastic bags for examination within 48 hr. We weighed each sample and washed it through 1\u2010mm mesh sieves. We recorded fecal contents per food category: (i) fruits with large seeds, i.e., seeds larger than 2 mm which may be easily counted in the fecal remains (including seeds, skin and pulp remains), (ii) fruits with small and uncountable seeds (smaller than 2 mm), such as Ficus sp. or Musanga cecropioides (seeds, skin and pulp remains), (iii) foliage (fiber, digested fragments of leaves and flowers), (iv) fragments of insects or other animal matter and (v) other items (soil, small branches, mushrooms or undefined items). We visually estimated the percentage of each category within 5% intervals, based on its volume in the fecal material [Basabose, 2002]. We identified cleaned fruit seeds to the species level and counted large seeds. Non\u2010fruit plant items were identified and described as accurately as possible.",

Over a period of 26 months, from May 2011 to June 2013, we monitored all trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 10 cm within 14 plots randomly located in the Nkala Forest (each plot measuring 0.04 ha, 0.56 ha in total). This represented a total of 346 trees belonging to 77 species. In May 2012, we added 8 additional plots (five 1 ha plots and three 0.25 ha plots, 5.75 ha in total) to improve our representation of fruiting trees. Our sample size increased by 2239 trees representing 32 additional species (14 monitored months). Every two weeks, we visited each of the plots and recorded which trees were fruiting by inspecting their crowns and counting the fruits on the ground [Basabose & Yamagiwa, 2002]. We then calculated an index of fruit availability (FAI). Fruit species considered for this index were derived by selecting tree species (i) eaten by bonobos (this study, Kano and Mulavwa 1992 Beaune et al., 2013) or (ii) producing fleshy fruits [Tailfer, 1989; Wilks & Issembe, 2000; Djoufack et al., 2007] (Supplementary Appendix 1, Table I). We used each tree basal area to estimate the canopy volume (Strier, 1989 cited in Basabose, 2002) and calculated the monthly fruit availability index (FAI) as: FAIm=\u2211pki\u00d7bak where p is the proportion of trees of species k bearing fruits during the plot visit i and ba is the basal area (in square meters per hectare) of species k in the forest. We assigned for each date of fecal sampling collection the closest recorded FAI.",

We used a generalized linear model with a negative binomial error structure and log link function. To model the number of species consumed daily and to account for differences in daily sampling efforts, we incorporated the sum of all species observed per feces each day as the response and we included an offset term to control for the variation of sampled feces (the daily number of feces log transformed). We included the sine and cosine of the date, converted to a circular variable, to estimate seasonal patterns. We introduced a temporal autocorrelation term to account for the difference in sample size collection according to time. For this, we used the average of the residuals of all other sampled days derived from the full model and weighted by distance as an additional predictor. The weight function had the shape of a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero (maximal weight at distance equals zero) and a standard deviation chosen such that the likelihood of the full model with the derived variable (autocorrelation term) included was maximized [F\u00fcrtbauer et al., 2011]. After running the model, we checked various model diagnostics [Field, 2005; Quinn & Keough, 2002]. Dfbetas and variance inflation factors did not reveal any issues (Supplementary Appendix 1, Table II and Table III). As the data showed some potentially influential cases of leverage, we used a subset of the data for the analysis (n = 254).

We tested whether non\u2010preferred fruits of tree species, important herb and liana species and unidentified fibers (i.e., residuals of THV and Marantaceae) should be considered as FBFs, by performing, for each species, a generalized linear model (GLM). We used GLMs with a negative binomial error structure and log link function for species present in more than one quarter of fecal samples. Because these models became unstable for less\u2010consumed species, we used GLMs with binomial error structure and logit link function for the other important species. Only the response (n = 2,230) changed depending on GLM types. For negative binomial models, we used, for important fruit species, the seed abundance in feces as the response. We calculated seed abundance as the total number of seeds of the given species divided by the wet weight of the fecal sample and multiplied by 100 to obtain a standardized measure of the relative amount of seeds consumed per fruit species per fecal sample [Moscovice et al., 2007]. For unidentified fibers and small\u2010seed species, we used the volume proportion in the feces as the response. For binomial models, we used the presence/absence of the species as the response. To test whether the consumption of the given species was related to the consumption of preferred foods, we incorporated as predictors the seed abundance of preferred foods. Since FBFs are consumed when availability of preferred species declines, we included FAI of preferred foods as a predictor. We also incorporated the global FAI as a predictor to test the influence of fruit tree availability on important fruit consumption. To account for temporal autocorrelation, we used the average of residuals of all other fecal samples derived from the full model and weighted (with the same function as for the previous models) by temporal distance as an additional predictor. Prior to running the models, we checked that correlations between predictors were not an issue with a Spearman test and that all predictors had a symmetrical distribution. Predictors of seed abundance were log\u2010transformed and FAI of preferred foods was square\u2010root transformed. All predictors were z\u2010transformed to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one to achieve more easily interpretable coefficients [Schielzeth, 2010]. After running the models, we checked various model diagnostics [Field, 2005; Quinn & Keough, 2002]. Dfbetas did not reveal any issues. Since the VIFs were too high for FAI of preferred foods and Dialium sp. abundance because of their high correlation (Spearman, rs = 0.56), we decided to remove Dialium sp. from the model. VIFs did not reveal any issues in the new models, and we removed potentially influential cases of leverage (Supplementary Appendix 3, Tables I and II). To check the overall effect of preferred food consumption and availability, we compared the deviance of the full model with that of a null model comprising only the autocorrelation term, using a likelihood ratio test. We further tested the effect of preferred food consumption by comparing the deviance of the full model with that of a reduced model comprising only the FAIs and the autocorrelation term, using likelihood ratio tests. We considered the species was a FBF when we found significant negative correlations (i) between its consumption and preferred food consumption (i.e., the comparison between the full and reduced model is significant and predictor estimates are negative) and (ii) between its consumption and FAI of preferred foods (i.e., the estimate of FAI of preferred foods is significantly negative).",

Unidentified fruit species were all occurring less than 10% of sampled days (Table IV in Supplementary Appendix 1). Sixteen fruit species were classified as important (Table I). The data collection period was sufficient to identify all the important species but probably not all the consumed species (Fig. 2A). Fruits constituted the majority of species identified in fecal samples (100% of presence in fecal samples; feces mean volume: 95.2%; Table V in Supplementary Appendix 1); of these, one species, Musanga cecropioides was particularly frequent (55% of all feces). Foliage was much less common in the feces (31% of feces; feces mean volume: 4.1%), but one species, Haumania liebrechtsiana, was particularly common on trails (55% of food remain samples). Animal matter and other items were rarely found (0.1% and 7.5% of feces, respectively). The presence of fruits of M. cecropioides in feces was negatively correlated with the presence of other fruit species (Spearman, rs = \u2212 0.92, P < 0.0001; Table V in Supplementary Appendix 1). The FAI was slightly positively correlated with the proportion of fruits in feces (Spearman, rs = 0.28, P < 0.0001) and slightly negatively correlated with the proportion of Musanga cecropioides fruits (Spearman, rs = \u2212 0.24, P < 0.0001, Fig. 2B). FAI was also slightly positively correlated with the number of daily consumed fruit species (Spearman, rs = \u2212 0.14, P < 0.0001). We found a daily mean of 2.8 \u00b1 SD 1.2 fruit species in fecal samples, showing significant seasonal variation (comparison between full and null model, X2 = 17.65, df =  2, P < 0.001), with a peak between January and March (Fig. 2C).",

Four of the eight important tree species (M. cecropioides, Dialium sp., Polyalthia suaveolens, and Piptostigma fasciculatum) were identified as preferred fruits (Table I). We decided to consider Cordia platythyrsa and Pancovia laurentii as preferred foods too. Indeed, these two species were never observed bearing fruits during our phenology surveys. In addition, the tree abundance survey conducted at the study site [Serckx et al., 2014] indicates that Cordia platythyrsa is rare in the forest (Table I in Supplementary Appendix 1). Pancovia laurentii was more common but mainly present at small DBH size (mean DBH: 16.35 cm), i.e., trees being probably too young to bear fruits. Since bonobos consume both species regularly, this suggests a high preference for these species despite their low fruit availability. In the case of M. cecropioides, we were not confident in its classification as a preferred food because we probably largely underestimated their fruit availability, due to the fact that the forest plots we used for phenology surveys were never situated in edge forests or disturbed areas, while the species is essentially observed in these habitat types. Consequently, we probably did not follow the appropriate trees to estimate species fruit availability. We thus decided to test whether the species should rather not be considered as a FBF. We found that M. cecropioides fruit consumption was clearly negatively correlated to fruit availability and abundance of other preferred fruits (Table II), indicating its role as a FBF. We further investigated the role of non\u2010preferred tree species, liana and herb fruit species. Four other fruit species came out as FBFs: Uapaca sp, the Marantaceae M. leucantha and two liana species: Landolphia sp1 and Landolphia sp2 (Table II, Fig. 5).",

Of these, sixteen fruit species were predominantly consumed (called important fruits). Fecal analyses suggested that bonobos were highly frugivorous (95% of feces volume was fruits), but we may have underestimated fiber consumption due to an artefact of our methodology (mesh sieve size of 1 mm). Our investigations revealed a seasonal pattern of consumption for 12 out of the 16 most important fruit species. Four species were identified as preferred fruits, and five species as FBFs (Table I). The consumption of the fruits of M. cecropioides and M. leucantha was especially important and we suggest that their role as FBFs may help explain the bonobo foraging strategy and perhaps also its cohesiveness in such a forest\u2010savannah ecosystem.",

Thompson [1997] already identified the importance of non\u2010tree species in another bonobo population living in forest\u2010savannah mosaics, where diet was composed of only 53% of forest fruit trees, but of numerous herb species and 3 savannah species. Unfortunately, we did not collect fruit availability data for these types of plants, preventing us from investigating their role as preferred foods in the bonobo diet. Our results showed, however, that 3 of the 8 species might be considered as FBFs (2 lianas: Landolphia sp1, Landolphia sp2, and 1 Marantaceae: M. leucantha). In addition, savannah fruit species have been found to be poor\u2010sugar species compared to fruits from trees [Thompson, 2003] while the importance of sugars in food selection by great apes has already been widely demonstrated [Hohmann et al., 2006, 2010; Reynolds et al., 1998; Remis, 2002; Rothman et al., 2011]. Both points suggest that these species are most probably FBFs or non\u2010preferred foods, but their consumption may enable bonobos to remain highly frugivorous in forest\u2010savannah mosaics.",

This finding suggests that bonobos prefer to remain in mature forests, as already observed for nesting site preference [Serckx et al., 2014], but need to extend their range of forest use to other habitat types in periods of fruit scarcity. This pattern has already been observed in the Kalinzu forest (Uganda), where chimpanzees favour Musanga\u2010dominated secondary forest when fruit availability in mixed mature forest decreases [Furuichi et al., 2001] or in Wamba (DRC), where bonobos increase their swamp forest use when the abundance of specific fruits typical in this habitat increases [Mulavwa et al., 2010]. Chancellor [2012] even observed that chimpanzees living in forest fragments of Rwanda increasingly use forest edges when fruit availability declines, to be close to maize fields for crop\u2010raiding. We never found cultivated items in fecal samples. However, this does not mean bonobos never consume crops, as local populations mainly cultivate non\u2010fruit species within forest fields (Serckx, data not shown), of which remains are difficult to observe in fecal samples. In fact, local people already complain that bonobos periodically degrade sugar cane fields. Even if crop\u2010raiding does not seem to be a current problem in the region, as observed in some chimpanzee populations [Chancellor et al., 2012; Humle & Matsuzawa, 2004; McLennan, 2013], the regular use of disturbed habitats may lead to future human\u2010bonobo conflicts, increasing the risk of poaching and injuries from snares for bonobos and also favouring zoonotic disease transmission [K\u00f6ndgen et al., 2008; Leendertz et al., 2006].",

While the role of Musanga spp. as FBF was already identified in various chimpanzee populations [Furuichi et al., 2001; Yamakoshi, 1998] and for other primates of Central Africa [Thomas, 1991], it was never the case, to our knowledge, for fruits of M. leucantha. An increasing number of studies have shown that abundant FBFs may be a key factor determining primate carrying capacity [Chancellor et al., 2012; Furuichi et al., 2001; Hanya & Chapman, 2013; Marshall et al., 2009; Oates et al., 1990; Thomas, 1991]. For example, the consumption of Dombeya torrido allows chimpanzee densities to remain high in forest fragments of Rwanda despite their small and degraded habitats [Chancellor et al., 2012]. Musanga spp. abundance has been suggested to play a role in chimpanzee density of Kalinzu forest [Furuichi et al., 2001] and in Cercopithecus biomass in the Ituri forest (DRC) [Thomas, 1991]. It is thus possible that the importance of M. cecropioides and M. leucantha in bonobo diet partially explains the similar density we found between forest\u2010savannah mosaics and dense forest populations [Serckx et al., 2014]. Further studies comparing bonobo density in different forest fragments according to M. cecropioides and M. leucantha abundance are needed however to confirm this hypothesis.",

Applying these concepts, it has been shown that gorillas can be considered as staple FBF consumers and chimpanzees as filler FBF consumers, but the classification of bonobos remains unclear [Harrison & Marshall, 2011; Marshall et al., 2009; Yamagiwa & Basabose, 2009]. Studies have demonstrated that gorillas usually form cohesive groups irrespective of fruit abundance but that frugivory and patchy distribution of fruits force them to extend their daily path length [Yamagiwa & Basabose, 2009]. Interestingly, we found a similar pattern for bonobos. First, bonobo cohesiveness at night was independent of fruit availability [Serckx et al., 2014]. Second, WWF trackers have reported that bonobos frequently cross their entire home range in one day to reach particular food trees (pers. comm. Paulin Ebabu). Direct observations are needed to confirm these observations. However, such behaviours, combined with the importance of abundant FBFs in their diet, suggest that bonobos, or at least the populations living in forest\u2010savannah mosaics, might be considered as staple FBF consumers.",

Identifying fallback resources is essential to develop appropriate conservation measures in environments where wildlife and humans share habitats [Marshall et al., 2009]. In addition, we found that bonobos are highly dependent on non\u2010tree species for feeding while numerous potentially consumed tree species are available within their home range. We also observed that the important fruits could be separated into six groups of associated foods in their diet. Both these results deserve further investigation to gain a better understanding of bonobo food species selection in forest\u2010savannah mosaics. In particular, additional studies on bonobo nutritional ecology [Felton et al., 2009; Irwin et al., 2014; Raubenheimer et al., 2009] will help to address such questions and may also be helpful in the development of targeted conservation strategies [Chapman et al., 2004; Felton et al., 2010].",
