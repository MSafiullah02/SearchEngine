Influenza viruses which are classified by their core proteins (i.e. A, B or C) and belong to the family orthomyxoviridae, cause predominantly respiratory disease in humans. Influenza type A and B account for > 50% of viral pneumonia in adults whereas influenza C infections generally cause mild respiratory disease and are not thought to cause epidemics [3]. The close contact between humans and animals in tropical areas may enhance the genetic reassortment of influenza viruses which when disseminated into the human population may result in pandemics [4]. Other important respiratory viruses in the tropics that can cause severe pneumonia are Influenza A H1N1, avian influenza viruses (H5N1, H7N9), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5], [6]. Standard, droplet and contact precautions are recommended for these selected acute respiratory infections and whenever possible patients should be placed in airborne infection isolation rooms.",

Currently two classes of antiviral drugs are available for the treatment and prevention of influenza: the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and the adamantines (amantadine and rimantadine) [15]. The adamantines block M2 protein channels and inhibit the uncoating of the influenza virus after it enters the host cells. They are only active against influenza A not B viruses and due to a marked increase in resistant isolates, many countries do not recommend that they be used except in combination with neuraminidase inhibitors in selected case.

In adults, the dose of oseltamivir is 75 mg orally twice daily; inhalational zanamivir is 10 mg (two inhalations) twice daily; and peramivir is 600 mg IV once daily. In patients with severe influenza, there are insufficient data to recommend the use of inhaled zanamivir or IV peramivir as empirical therapy. As such empirical treatment with oseltamivir should be started as soon as possible for all hospitalised cases associated with severe disease, and for confirmed and probable outpatient cases. Early therapy (especially within 48 h of illness onset) can shorten the duration of the symptoms in high-risk patients and reduce secondary complications associated with influenza. The recommended duration of antiviral therapy is five days for uncomplicated disease. In severely ill hospitalised or immunocompromised patients, longer courses of treatment (e.g. 10 days) should be considered. In these circumstances, a higher dose of oseltamivir has been recommended by some experts (150 mg twice daily) in adults with normal renal function. However, oral oseltamivir has been reported to be adequately absorbed in critically ill patients and higher dosing may not provide additional clinical benefit. In obese patients, studies have demonstrated adequate exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate (active metabolite of oseltamivir) with the 75 mg twice daily dosing regimen. Limited data suggest that oseltamivir administered by oro/naso-gastric tube is well absorbed in critically ill patients, including in those on continuous renal replacement therapy and ECMO [16].",

It is possible that novel influenza A viruses may become resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir during treatment but remain susceptible to zanamivir. In resistant infection, zanamivir is the preferred agent and can be delivered by inhalation or by the intravenous route. Corticosteroid treatment is controversial with some reports showing benefit and others harm. In all cases of severe influenza whatever the type bacterial coinfection is possible and as such, appropriate antimicrobial treatment directed toward those organisms causing bacterial acute community acquired pneumonia, and mechanical ventilation as required can reduce the mortality rate. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been utilised in some patients with ARDS and one study showed a possible mortality benefit in patients who were referred to a specialised ECMO centre [17].",
