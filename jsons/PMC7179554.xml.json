The family is comprised of two genera, Coronavirus and Torovirus, that share similarities in morphology, genome organization and genome expression [3]. The coronavirus genome consists of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA molecule that is 20-30 kb in size [3, 4]. Virions are enveloped, pleomorphic, 80-220 nm in diameter, and have club-shaped surface projections approximately 20 nm in length [3, 4]. Three major structural proteins are known, the surface (S) glycoprotein (90-180 kD), an intermembrane matrix (M) protein (20-35 kD), and a nucleocapsid (N) protein (50-60 kD) [3, 4].",

Mammalian coronaviruses were shown to comprise antigenic groups 1 and 2, whereas avian coronaviruses, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCV), comprised groups 3 and 4, respectively [1, 2, 5, 6]. IBV and TCV were determined to be antigenically distinct from each other and mammalian coronaviruses based on IEM, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus-neutralization (VN) studies [7, 8]; however, subsequent antigenic and genomic analyses have questioned these taxonomic groupings. Studies done by Dea et al. [9] and later by Verbeek and Tijssen [10] indicated that TCV and bovine coronavirus (BCV), a mammalian group 2 coronavirus, were closely related based on antigenic and nucleotide sequence analyses. In contrast to the findings of these studies, antigenic analyses by Guy et al. [11] indicated that the avian coronaviruses, IBV and TCV, are closely related and comprise a single antigenic group within the coronavirus genus [11].",

The source of template RNA was examined by isopycnic centrifugation of TCV (NC95) in a sucrose gradient, followed by gradient fractionation, nucleic acid extraction, and RT-PCR amplification of individual gradient fractions. Gradient fractions which yielded positive RT-PCR products had densities of 1.113 g/cm3 and 1.14 to 1.20 g/cm3. Coronaviruses have a buoyant density in sucrose of approximately 1.15-1.19 g/cm3 [3]. Thus, the material used for RNA extraction and RT-PCR banded at densities consistent with that of coronaviruses. The nature of the material that banded at a density of 1.113 g/cm3 and produced a positive RT-PCR product has not been determined; however, this material likely resulted from virion degradation and release of viral RNA during sedimentation in sucrose.",
