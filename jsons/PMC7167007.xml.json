            "text": "Stroke is a global health concern that leads to permanent disability in approximately 30% of survivors (Weinstein, Koerner, & M\u00f6ller, 2010). It has devastating complications arising from either a sudden loss of blood supply to the brain (ischemic stroke) or rupturing of blood vessels in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke) (Deb, Sharma, & Hassan, 2010). Stroke leads to the induction of inflammatory cascade via migration of activated microglia to the ischemic core, worsening its outcomes (Perera et al., 2006). The narrow therapeutic window and insufficiency to recover or protect the dying neurons are certain limitations of current treatment strategies for stroke, so there is an urgent need for an alternative approach (Fann et al., 2013; Kaur et al., 2018). The limitation to improve the aggravated inflammatory condition by currently used thrombolytic agents necessitates newer treatment options for stroke (Carroll, 2009). Interferon\u2010\u03b2 is known to have immunomodulatory and anti\u2010inflammatory properties and can be explored for improving conditions after stroke (Dhib\u2010Jalbut & Marks, 2010). IFN\u2010\u03b2 plays a role as an anti\u2010inflammatory agent through several immune cascades. IFN\u2010\u03b2 significantly helps in obviating neuro\u2010inflammatory conditions of the central nervous system and improves the pathogenesis of many neurological conditions. A report suggested its role in decreasing neuronal cell death and increasing functional recovery attenuating inflammation after stroke onset (Kuo et al., 2016).",

IFN\u2010\u03b2 drives innate immunity, acting in response to pathogenic attack or injury via activation of both pro\u2010and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines.

            "text": "Neurodegeneration is mostly triggered by numerous inflammatory mediators that can lead to neurological pathologies including ischemic stroke (Zipp & Aktas, 2006). Inflammation is initiated by the release of various inflammatory mediators; activation of intravascular leukocytes helps in the infiltration of immune cells in the CNS (Anrather & Iadecola, 2016; Kieseier, 2011). Immune cells migration across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) causes breakdown of the BBB due to the release of numerous cytotoxic agents like cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase, nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to demyelination and axonal injury which are common outcomes of neurodegeneration (Kuo et al., 2016). Although the damage caused to neurons is not reparable, immunomodulatory therapies have been reported to decrease inflammation (Markowitz, 2007). IFN\u2010\u03b2, a polypeptide produced by fibroblasts, attaches to its specific receptor and initiates a complex transcriptional reaction producing a pharmacological response at the site of injury. Markowitz reported that IFN\u2010\u03b2 helps in suppressing antigen presentation, decreasing T cell proliferation, and altering cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase expression (Kieseier, 2011; Markowitz, 2007).",

A systemic application of IFN\u2010\u03b2 may reduce the increased cell count of inflammatory cells across the BBB and help raise nerve growth factor (NGF) levels, ultimately resulting in a dramatic increase in the survival of neurons (Kieseier, 2011). IFN\u2010\u03b2 may also help in raising the CD56bright natural killer cell count: these cells produce anti\u2010inflammatory mediators very efficiently and have the capacity to mitigate neuronal inflammation in the peripheral blood circulation. With various mechanistic approaches, IFN\u2010\u03b2 manifests to be clinically relevant by reducing lesions, decreasing the risk of sustained disability progression, and decreasing brain atrophy (Kieseier, 2011).",

Immune cell therapies are highly explored in not only preclinical but also clinical settings for various acute injuries related with the CNS, including stroke (Bang, 2016; George & Steinberg, 2015).

IFN\u2010\u03b2 directly affects T cells and inhibits adhesion of molecules like intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM) to the BBB and passage through the same (Dhib\u2010Jalbut & Marks, 2010). B cells secrete inflammatory mediators that are responsible for stimulating plasma cells to produce immunoglobulins (IGs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Dalakas, 2008). B cell activating factor (BAFF), belonging to the TNF family, is upregulated in the blood (Krumbholz et al., 2008) and is crucial for maintaining B cells level at the inflammation site and can aggravate local inflammation by facilitating B cell survival (Krumbholz et al., 2005). IFN\u2010\u03b2 modulates B\u2010cell function which can alter antigen presentation. Expression of MHC II on B cells is reduced post\u2010therapy with the help of IFN\u2010\u03b2 through a decrease in CD80 expression that inhibits antigen presentation to CD8+T cells (Gen\u00e7, Dona, & Reder, 1997; Jiang et al., 1995). IFN\u2010\u03b2 treatment results in the upregulation of CD86 expressing B cells and contributes to the reduction of type 1 T helper (Th1) cell secretion of inflammatory cytokines (Huang, Ito, Dangond, & Dhib\u2010Jalbut, 2013). Levels of BAFF are also upregulated in blood leukocytes and serum with IFN\u2010\u03b2 therapy, showing elevated B cell function (Krumbholz et al., 2008). With the correct combination of stimuli, it can lead to increased B cell secretion of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines like IL\u20108 and IL\u201010, suggesting that IFN\u2010\u03b2 can increase CD4 and CD8 regulatory T cells along with regulatory B cells (Meinl, Krumbholz, & Hohlfeld, 2006).",

These events are responsible for causing microvascular injury, BBB dysfunction, and elicit inflammation after ischemia. Events of such kind worsen the primary injury and may result in severe cerebral damage. The extent of permanent cerebral damage relies upon different factors such as ischemic duration, infarct volume, along with the auto\u2010repairing capability of the brain (Dirnagl, Iadecola, & Moskowitz, 1999; Lakhan et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Since the discovery of IFNs, IFN has progressed from a poorly understood antiviral substance to being FDA\u2010approved for the treatment of five disorders (Baron et al., 1991). We have discussed the various mechanisms of IFN\u2010\u03b2 and its therapeutic potential. However, certain side effects limit the use of IFN\u2010\u03b2 (Pestka, 2007). Although IFN\u2010\u03b2 is usually safe and well tolerated, it causes certain adverse effects. IFNs not only cause local adverse events but systemic adverse reactions as well (Kolb\u2010M\u00e4urer, Goebeler, & M\u00e4urer, 2015). After treatment with IFN\u2010\u03b2, patients have exhibited fatigue, myalgia, headache, malaise, and joint pain (Pestka, 2007). Depression has been reported in patients with no prior psychiatric history following IFN\u2010\u03b2 therapy (Fragoso et al., 2010). Reduced doses of IFN\u2010\u03b2 have elicited severe depression and altered tolerability, resulting in discontinuation of treatment (Asnis & De La Garza II, 2005). Few studies have demonstrated that endogenous molecules like melatonin, a potent antioxidant and a regulator of circadian rhythm, maybe helpful in mitigating the depressive symptoms associated with IFN\u2010\u03b2 (Hansen, Danielsen, Hageman, Rosenberg, & G\u00f6genur, 2014). Also, it has been reported that therapy of IFN\u2010\u03b2 in combination with L\u2010methyl folate or S\u2010adenosyl methionine has varying degrees of outcomes in monotherapy or augmentation therapy for depression (Franscina Pinto & Andrade, 2016). However, till date, no studies have been examined in therapeutic treatment of the IFN\u2010\u03b2\u2010related depressive disorder and should, therefore, be appraised as a possibility in future studies. Thus, IFN\u2010\u03b2 therapy may serve as a substantial therapy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke if the side effects of IFN\u2010\u03b2 can be reduced and prevented.",

IFN\u2010\u03b2 may play protective and multiphasic roles after ischemic stroke. This review focused on the neuroprotective role of IFN\u2010\u03b2 in ischemic stroke.

With these preclinical findings, IFN\u2010\u03b2 has entered the clinical level as a therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke.

IFN\u2010\u03b2 helps in suppressing overexpressed inflammatory cytokines and ultimately helps in reducing the brain infarct in ischemic brain. (b) After an ischemic injury on the ipsilateral side of the hemisphere, there are increased expressions of IBA1 (specifically expressed in microglial cells (MGs), helps in MG regulation) in the cortex. Increased IBA1 results in the transformation of resting MGs to reactive MGs. Reactive MGs influence release of inflammatory cytokines, for example, IL\u20106, IL\u20104, IL\u20101B, IL\u201023p9, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 leads to cytotoxicity which in turn results in infarct formation in the brain at the injury site. IFN\u2010\u03b2 inhibits upregulated IBA1 expression in the cortex of ipsilateral side and reduces the MG activation in the ischemic brain [Colour figure can be viewed at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com]",

            "text": "Figure 3: Mechanism of action of IFN\u2010\u03b2. (a) Ischemic injury followed by reperfusion. Within hours of ischemia, upregulation of adhesion molecules expression (e.g., ICAM\u20101, VCAM\u20101, and E\u2010selectin,) on the brain endothelial surface. These upregulated adhesion molecules increase the influx of inflammatory cells (e.g., monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, and T cells) to the ischemic brain, causing Infarct formation. IFN\u2010\u03b2 reduces the upregulated adhesion molecule expression (e.g., ICAM\u20101, VCAM\u20101, and E\u2010selectin) and helps in reducing the infarct formation by decreasing inflammatory cell influx into the brain. (b) After ischemic injury, resting microglial cells are activated and increase the release of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP\u20109), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20101 (MCP\u20101), interleukin 1B (IL\u20101B), IL\u20108 which facilitate inflammatory cellinfiltration (monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, and T cells) at the injury site in the brain. Increased infiltration of inflammatory cells compromises the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) integrity and leads to secondary brain injury, responsible for increased infarct area in the brain. IFN\u2010\u03b2 impairs the ischemia\u2010induced chemokine (C\u2010C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), Chemokine (C\u2010X\u2010C motif) ligand 3 (CXCL3), and MMP\u20109 expressions and helps to reduce brain infarct. (c) Ischemic injury is followed with reperfusion. Reperfusion increases the peripheral immune cell infiltration (CD45hiCD11b+, CD11b+Ly6G+, CD4+, \u03b3\u03b4 T Cells) at brain injury and leads to BBB compromise; it leads to BBB disruption and secondary brain injury, results in infarct formation in the brain. IFN\u2010\u03b2 lowers the number of infiltrating cells that is, CD45hiCD11b+, CD11b+Ly6G+, CD4+, \u03b3\u03b4 T Cells in ipsilateral side of the brain and shows a protective role in ischemic stroke by decreasing BBB disruption [Colour figure can be viewed at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com]",
