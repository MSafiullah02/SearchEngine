This research was conducted in and around the first Women's March of 2017. We wanted to know: What were marchers' prior histories of political activism prior to the election? If this was their first time participating in such a manner, how did the election and its early political fallout inspire marchers to attend? 2) What plans did marchers have for political activism after the march? 3) What can be learned from these participants about the current state of political activism in our current era? A total of 788 individuals had taken part in the online survey. Among the participants, 45% marched on Washington, and 55% participated in the march in their local cities. We found that issues of gender equality were of great concern to many of the marchers. In particular, issues related to economic and social equity, including salary. These findings are interesting as they speak to the broader implications of gender equality. And, as the past few years have demonstrated, these issues continue to be of concern.",

I was scared. My college students were contacting me. They were scared. One student said to me, \"How am I going to live in the world now?\" I cried in the airport. That evening, at the hotel restaurant I witnessed a female server describe to another female server how she had just been grabbed by her genitals by an intoxicated man. \"It's open season,\" I thought. . . . (Marcher/Author 1) Three hundred thousand plus pink hats were the omnipresent symbol for the Women's March on Washington, in Washington, D.C., on January 21, 2017, the day after the inauguration of President Donald J. Trump. Most hand-made, these hats were a grassroots provocation in response to Trump's profane comment about grabbing women by their genitals. Using language that attempts to make sexual assault permissible is not acceptable-and that was just one of the messages of the march held round the world. and Bob Bland soon combined their efforts, which led to thousands of people signing up via social media to march. The founders from the start worked to ensure that the movement was intersectional and inclusive.",

Sounding good on its face, it ultimately served to separate people from coming together as a collective because there are not necessarily any shared collective goals. The second script is the post-feminist myth: that the goals of feminism have already been achieved, and thus feminism is no longer necessary.

Frame analysis is a process to understand how people view situations, and interpret or process information. According to Snow (1986) , there are four different types of frames: frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension, and frame transformation. Of these, frame transformation is most relevant to this study. Frame transformation involves completely changing the rhetoric of the current state of affairs, and creating new values that have not been previously considered J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Clark, Prentiss Dantzler, & Nickels, 2018) . The literature on social movements explains how different activists can gain more influence than others, mobilize others differently, and frame their movements differently, involving innovation, agency, and strategy (Ganz, 2000) . When faced with new challenges, activist leaders use their knowledge to create unique solutions in order to inspire engagement (Ganz, 2000) . According to Ganz (2002): Organizers motivate action by deepening people's understanding of who they are, what they want, and why. Mobilizing feel-ings of anger, courage, hopefulness, self worth, community and urgency, they challenge feelings of fear, despair, self doubt, isolation, and apathy that inhibit action. They help people articulate their values as a shared story of challenges they face, why they must face them, and why others should help--rooted in who they are, where they've been, where they want to go. (p. 16) According to Han (2016), organizational context has a strong influence on individual choice to engage in activism; that is, the choice to participate in political activism may result from inspiring social interactions between current and potential activists. We theorize that after the 2016 election, people from around the world were more motivated to speak out, whether virtually or in-peron, to protest the ableist, racist, sexist, and homophobic rhetoric of the new president, and that many of these people were inspired to engage from online interactions with the organizers of The Women's March via social media. In sum, according to Han (2016), activism is crucial in making democracy work, and it is on the rise as technology changes how we do activism.",

I was accustomed to my preferred candidates losing, but this time it was different. It was personal. It was an affront. It was an attack. Attending the march made me feel there was some kind of hope. Helping students register to vote was also an affirming act for me. (Marcher/author) Since the Women's March on Washington in 2017, an almost innumerable amount of concerning events have taken place at the hand of the Trump Administration. Despite advances in the public discourse over issues of sexual violence (re: the -Me Too,\u2016 and -Time's Up\u2016 movements), women's experiences and credibility seem to still up for debate. This issue was particularly evident in the hearings for the successful Trump nominee for Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh. As the world watched, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified with the candor and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f specificity of a professor of psychology who had experienced sexual trauma, and understood the neurological implications of such events. Yet, while the particular function and forum for her testimony was unique, her experiences were not. Sexual assault and harassment continue to be a reality for the vast majority of women, many of whom live and study on college campuses (Brown, 2018) . In the end, Dr. Blasey Ford's testimony was deafened by Judge Kavanaugh's overwhelming privilege. It would be interesting to revisit the questions posed to the participants at the Women's March on Washington with these same participants. Are we feeling less passionate or more emboldened by the actions of the president and others in power?",

First, the largest portion of participants reported protest and dissent as their reasons to march (63.2%), followed by issues other than gender (43.6%) and gender issues (40.9%). Similarly, a striking portion of participants reported showing protest and dissent as what they hoped to accomplish (81.3%). Of the seven areas (including no response), only four showed much response in participants' concerns for the 2016 electiongender issues (43.7%), issues other than gender (28.5%), protest and dissent (26.9%), and no response (15.9%). While it is encouraging that very few responses indicated that they expected to accomplish nothing for each of the three questions, it is worth noting that more than a fifth of the participants provided no response to the question of why they marched (21.4%). Because participant responses in each of these three main questions could have more than one coded response, it is also important to examine each area for participants' strongest category. Unlike in Figure 1, in Figure 2, each distribution for each question totals 100%. This figure is otherwise constructed in the same manner as Figure 1.
