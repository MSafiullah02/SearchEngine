The mortality rate for epidemics of this disease can reach levels as high as 24% to 50%.9, 10 The unusual susceptibility of newborns to this syndrome may be explained by their unique host status. Most neonates have not acquired a normal intestinal flora or specific immunity. In infants in special care nurseries, this situation is compounded by severe underlying conditions, such as prematurity or congenital cardiac or pulmonary disease. The consequences of diarrhea in the newborn are unusually severe, partially because they have poorly developed homeostatic mechanisms with limited water and electrolyte reserves. Nosocomial transmission often occurs because the newborn nurseries may be crowded with susceptible infants.11 In addition, delays in recognizing a nursery outbreak may occur because infants may not develop diarrhea until after they have been discharged from the hospital.",

Early signs, such as failure to gain weight or a slight weight loss and abdominal distention, may be subtle. The disease may progress to more severe signs of dehydration and shock with depressed sensorium, drowsiness, coma, sunken eyes, circumoral cyanosis, and grayish discoloration of the skin. Shock without hyperpnea often occurs in this setting despite the development of severe acidosis. Poorly nourished infants may develop severe hypokalemia, hyponatremic dehydration, and/or paradoxic edema. Although this illness can be quite severe during outbreaks, some studies have also reported a milder form of this illness with much lower morbidity and mortality.14, 15\n",

Early and late onset of complications may include otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia, peritonitis, and renal vein or cerebral sinus thrombosis. Several potentially life-threatening processes may mimic this infantile diarrhea syndrome. So-called parenteral diarrhea refers to the well-recognized but poorly understood tendency for systemic infections or localized infections elsewhere (e.g., otitis, meningitis) to be manifested clinically with diarrhea. Likewise, a strangulated hernia, intussusception, or torsion of an ovary or testis may be manifested by abdominal pain or diarrhea.",

For example, an outbreak of diarrheal illness was described in which multiple serotypes of different organisms (E. coli, Klebsiella, and Citrobacter) were found to be transiently enterotoxigenic.36 This observation suggests the transmission of enterotoxigenic potential between susceptible strains, likely by certain plasmids37 or by bacteriophages.38 Another report of sporadic diarrhea among infants and children in Africa showed that several enteric organisms other than E. coli may produce an enterotoxin under certain conditions.39 This finding is relevant to other situations as well, as typified by an outbreak of watery diarrhea occurring on a cruise ship and found to be caused by enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli, as well as Klebsiella spp. and Citrobacter spp.40 Many other well-known bacterial causes of diarrhea, such as shigellosis41 and epidemic salmonellosis, may also spread readily in the newborn nursery setting.42, 43 Viral causes of epidemic infantile diarrhea include, but are not limited to, specific types of echoviruses,44 coxsackieviruses,45 adenoviruses,46 and rotaviruses.47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 For example, echovirus 18 was isolated from 10 of 12 infants who had watery noninflammatory diarrhea in a nursery for premature infants. The virus was also isolated from two nurses, one of whom was implicated in the spread of the agent to five babies in another ward.44 Hospital acquisition of rotaviruses is common among newborns, and clinical syndromes range from asymptomatic or mild disease to a moderately severe epidemic type of outbreak.53 In addition to being clearly implicated as a potential cause of epidemic outbreaks of nosocomial neonatal diarrhea,50, 51, 52 rotaviruses can also be the cause of cases of sporadic infantile diarrhea occurring after the neonatal period.",

The Cleveland family studies of Dingle and co-workers132 showed that enteritis was second only to upper respiratory infection as a cause of illness in homes. Gastrointestinal illnesses were most common between the ages of 1 and 10 years, when approximately two illnesses occurred per person per year. The peak season for these gastrointestinal illnesses was November through February, with June being the month of lowest frequency. Most illnesses lasted 1 to 3 days; 20% occurred with respiratory symptoms, and 20% involved only diarrhea.",

With the increased infection-to-case ratio of El Tor cholera, the seventh pandemic swept most of the continents of the Eastern Hemisphere, including Asia, Africa, and the Mediterranean portions of Europe.184 Isolated cases have also occurred in the United States.185, 186 Outbreaks have been related to contaminated mineral water187 and to undercooked shellfish.188, 189 Beginning in Madras, India, in late 1992 and rapidly spreading to Calcutta and Bangladesh in 1993, a new strain of non-O1 Vibrio cholerae\u2014O139, called Bengal\u2014is causing epidemic cholera gravis and may represent the beginning of an eighth pandemic.190, 191, 192, 193, 194 Severe, watery diarrhea in a patient residing in, or having recently traveled to, an endemic area should raise the suspicion of cholera. The disease can be so fulminant as to cause hypovolemic shock and death from the outpouring of fluid into the upper portion of the small bowel before the first diarrheal stool occurs.195 As discussed in detail in Chapter 216, the entire dehydrating syndrome of cholera appears to be related to the activation of intestinal adenylate cyclase by the potent cholera enterotoxin.76, 77, 196, 197 To make the diagnosis of cholera bacteriologically, stool specimens should be cultured onto thiosulfate citrate bile salts\u2013sucrose agar. Of prime importance in therapy is fluid replacement, accomplished either intravenously with isotonic fluids or orally with glucose-electrolyte solutions.",

In 1956, De and associates198 demonstrated that E. coli isolated from adults and children with this syndrome caused fluid accumulation similar to that seen with V. cholerae infection in ligated rabbit ileal loops. In the early 1960s, Trabulsi,199 working in S\u00e3o Paulo, reported similar findings with \u201ctoxigenic\u201d E. coli. Since then, a variety of investigators have shown that many cases of \u201cacute undifferentiated diarrhea\u201d in adults were caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli strains that usually were not of the classically recognized pathogenic serotypes.200, 201, 202, 203 The toxic material present in the culture filtrate of these E. coli strains was demonstrated to be heat labile and nondialyzable. Subsequent studies demonstrated two types of enterotoxin produced by ETEC, namely LT and heat-stable enterotoxin (ST).204 Like cholera toxin, the E. coli LT activates mucosal adenylate cyclase.60, 61, 62 and is antigenically and mechanistically similar to cholera toxin in many ways. In contrast, ST activates guanylate cyclase,205, 206, 207 has an earlier onset of action,204 has greater tissue specificity,207 and has a much lower molecular weight than LT.208 I The role of yet a different type of enterotoxin, STb, which causes secretion in piglets without altering intestinal cyclic adenosine monophosphate or cyclic guanosine monophosphate remains unclear in humans at present.209, 210, 211\n",

In one study, astrovirus, picobirnavirus, calicivirus, and adenovirus were found in 6% to 12% of HIV-positive patients with diarrhea.280 Other common enteric infections include esophagitis or stomatitis with Candida or herpes simplex virus.

ART has decreased the incidence of several important opportunistic infections, including certain causes of gastroenteritis. Of particular note, there has been a dramatic decline in the incidence of tissue-invasive infections caused by cytomegalovirus, including luminal gastrointestinal disease.274, 283, 284 The treatment regimens available for many organisms causing infectious gastroenteritis in HIV-infected patients are less than satisfactory, but significant advances continue to be made. In addition to developing more effective treatments, an effort to judiciously adhere to safe food and water guidelines in higher-risk patients can provide significant help in preventing many types of serious enteric infections.285\n",

The first suggestion that an infectious bacterial process was likely came from the effective reduction in the attack rate achieved by the use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents.211, 335, 340, 343 Studies by Kean319 suggested that certain EPEC serotypes might be involved in up to one third of the cases. The involvement of E. coli was further confirmed in an outbreak of traveler's diarrhea among British troops in Aden, where E. coli O148 was identified in 54% of the British troops with diarrhea.336\n",

Neoplastic and endocrine causes of diarrhea include carcinoid tumors, Werner's syndrome (multiple endocrine adenomatosis), Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma), \u201cpancreatic cholera\u201d syndromes, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, and thyrotoxicosis. Patients with partial mechanical bowel obstruction or pellagra may also have chronic diarrhea. Milder forms of inflammatory bowel disease as well as irritable bowel disease can also be associated with a variety of types of chronic diarrhea. Although a thorough search for an infectious cause of any form of chronic diarrhea is usually warranted, most often the specific diagnosis of one of these etiologies usually requires referral to gastroenterologist.",
