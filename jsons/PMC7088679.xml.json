            "text": "There is a strong presumption in modern industrialized democracies, endorsed by most scientists, in favor of minimal government interference in the content of basic scientific research (Baltimore 2005). An example of this presumption is National Security Decision Document 189 issued by U.S. President Reagan in 1985, and adhered to by every U.S. Administration since, which states that it is the government\u2019s policy that, \u201cto the maximum extent possible, the products of fundamental research [shall] remain unrestricted\u201d (National Security Decision Directive 1985). As John Marburger, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the George W. Bush administration trenchantly summarized this common view, \u201c[w]here the marketplace of ideas is regulated, the quality of thought diminishes, and science suffers\u201d (Marburger 2003). Under this traditional paradigm, science is regulated by scientists rather than lawmakers: \u201cThe central reality\u2026is that the scientific community in America today is a self-governing republic. Scientists, not governments or voters, decide what is good and what is bad in science\u201d (Goldberg 1994).",

            "text": "In recent years, the regulatory immunity of basic scientific research has come under increasing attack. These challenges to the \u201chands off\u201d approach to basic science stem from several sources. One key determinant is the enormous power of the knowledge and technologies that could be unleashed as a result of scientific research in emerging fields such as genomics, biotechnology, synthetic biology, cognitive science and nanotechnology. While these emerging technologies have the potential for many benefits, they also tend to be dual-use, capable of both good and pernicious applications. Unlike potentially dangerous dual use research of the past such as nuclear research, these new types of research can be undertaken with relatively little equipment and infrastructure, and thus are much less subject to centralized control and monitoring than has been the case in the past (Atlas 2005). As the possible risks of pernicious applications of these new emerging technologies increase with the power, availability and access to the technology, the progress of scientific research may reach a point where the results of that research could have devastating consequences, possibly even risking the continued existence of the species (so called \u201cexistential\u201d or \u201ccatastrophic\u201d risks) (Bostrom 2002; Posner 2004). This is the argument for foregoing the risks along with the benefits by prohibiting the research altogether (Jonas 1984). As Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, wrote in his influential article published in Wired magazine, \u201cif our own extinction is a likely, or even possible, outcome of our technological development, shouldn\u2019t we proceed with great caution?\u201d (Joy 2000). Such catastrophic risks have only become apparent in recent decades, and create a new and compelling case for restricting some types of scientific research (Atkinson 1978; Rees 2003).",

            "text": "A second and related concern is based on a type of technological determinism, and embodies the fear that if the research community develops a technology with potentially destructive applications, someone somewhere will eventually and inevitably use it in such a mode. In a speech to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003, George Poste, Director of the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, warned: \u201cIf you actually look at the history of the assimilation of technological advance into the calculus of military affairs, you cannot find a historical precedent in which dramatic new technologies that redress military inferiority are not deployed\u201d (Quoted in Williams 2006). Thus, it may be prudent to never let the genie out of the bottle in the first place. For example, shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York City, the New York Times printed a discussion amongst several technology experts about the implications of those attacks for technology. One expert stated that 9/11 demonstrated that humans were capable of unimaginable evil, and thus the species might be better off foregoing new powerful technologies such as nanotechnology that could potentially be used in future, even-more-terrible terrorist acts (Kolata 2001).",

            "text": "Unfortunately, many of the technologies that may be used for malevolent purposes are initially developed for the purpose of peaceful commercial applications. An example is the development and use of bioengineered weapons. As Brian Rappert, an international expert on codes of conduct at the University of Exeter, pointed out (Rappert 2003), knowledge and techniques gained from genetics, genomics, chemistry, and bio-informatics have increased rapidly, and are quickly becoming widely commercialized. With this increase in commercialization comes an increased risk that these technologies will be used for malevolent purposes. Some specific examples include (Fraser and Dando 2001):Survivability of a particular organism in various harsh environmental conditions can be improved through gene splicing, which could make eradication of that organism much more difficult.Pathogenic bacterial agents can be made resistant to current antibiotics. Reports regarding the Soviet weapons program indicate that it is possible to engineer the causal agent of plague to be resistant to several antibiotics (Barnaby 1997).Genes responsible for an organism\u2019s pathogenicity can be transferred into non-pathogenic bacteria, causing the newly engineered bacteria to exhibit pathogenic qualities. Further, the transfer of pathogenic genes into an already pathogenic organism can result in an organism with increased virulence.Pathogenic bacteria can be modified to produce greater quantities of toxins.Pathogenic bacteria can be genetically engineered to hide telltale signatures, used for identification, which can then be followed by an appropriate method of eradication. It has been reported that Russian scientists were able to produce a strain of anthrax that rendered anthrax detection tests ineffective.\n",

            "text": "A third reason for increasing calls for restricting some research, closely related to the second reason above, relates to several recent high-profile incidents involving publication of scientific studies that many scientists and non-scientists believe should not have been undertaken or at least not published, undermining confidence in scientific self-regulation and restraint as an effective control on dangerous science. These incidents have created growing interest and pressure for more formal and mandatory limits on scientific inquiry that may have dangerous applications. A prominent example is the publication of an Australian study in which mousepox virus was unintentionally modified to circumvent vaccine immunity (Jackson et al. 2001), a result that could potentially be used to genetically engineer a more dangerous human virus (e.g., smallpox) (Stephenson 2001). Other examples of controversial studies include the publication of the genetic sequences of the poliovirus (Cello et al. 2002; Wimmer 2006) and the 1918 influenza virus (Kurzweil 2005; Tumpey et al. 2005), a published study showing how terrorists could contaminate the milk supply with botulinum toxin (Alberts 2005; Wein and Liu 2005), and studies involving implantation of human embryonic cells into primates (Greene et al. 2005; Ourednik et al. 2001). The failure of scientific self-restraint to forgo such ethically problematic studies, along with the increasing commercialization of basic science, has convinced some critics that scientists are too self-interested and permissive to have sole discretion on what studies are done. As one critic, Sue Mayer of Genewatch in the United Kingdom, recently stated with respect to experiments involving the synthesis of novel life forms, \u201c[s]cientists creating new life forms cannot be allowed to act as judge and jury\u2026Public debate and policing is needed\u201d (Sample 2006).",

These scientific developments are seen as intruding on fundamental beliefs about \u201cwhat it means to be human,\u201d and create fears of Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World becoming a reality. For example, biotechnology research has been described as having the potential \u201cto change human nature and therefore the way that we think of ourselves as a species\u201d (Fukuyama 2002). A loose network of individuals and groups from both the left and right of the political spectrum, including pro-life Christians, environmentalists concerned with the sanctity of nature, and people concerned about the potential return of eugenics, have proposed banning technologies such as in vitro fertilization, stem cell research, transgenic crops, and human cloning based on ethical and moral concerns (Fukuyama 2002; Jasanoff 2005). Some jurisdictions have already banned certain types of scientific research as a result of such concerns. For example, Germany and France were among the first nations to ban research that could lead to human reproductive cloning. Germany, taking a strict stance, banned all genetic research on human embryos in 1990, and France adopted legislation which severely restricted the use of frozen embryos in medical research (effectively banning human reproductive cloning) in June of 2001.",

In the scientific exuberance of post-World War II, science was seen as both pure and beneficial, the stepping stone to progress that would make life more enjoyable, convenient and healthy. Today, the view of science is more jaded, with growing emphasis in the popular media and public opinion on the sinister side of science, a potentially dangerous undertaking that can be manipulated to serve the narrow, self-interested perspective of powerful interests that fund research. For example, according to a survey conducted by Virginia Commonwealth University in 2004, while 90% of American respondents agreed that \u201cdevelopments in science have helped make society better,\u201d 61% of respondents agreed that \u201cscientific research these days doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to the moral values of society\u201d (VCU Center for Public Policy 2004). A study by the National Science Foundation found that while 84% of Americans are positive overall about the prospects of science, more than half of respondents nevertheless agreed that \u201cscientific research these days doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to the moral values of society\u201d and that \u201cscientific research has created as many problems for society as it has solutions\u201d (NSF 2006).",

We need institutions with real enforcement powers\u201d (Fukuyama 2002). The U.S. House of Representatives responded to such calls by passing legislation in 2001 and again in 2003 that would have criminalized the creation of embryonic stem cells even for therapeutic uses, because it involves destruction of an embryo, but both bills died in the Senate without being enacted (H.R. 534 2003). With recent changes in the composition of Congress, federal legislative efforts to criminalize embryonic stem cell research have stalled, and indeed the momentum is in favor of expanding funding for it. Nevertheless, a substantial minority of both chambers of Congress currently supports a criminal ban on embryonic stem cell research, and such efforts could be resurrected in the future if the balance of power again shifts. Meanwhile, most of the efforts to ban such research have passed to the states. For example, a coalition of organizations attempted (unsuccessfully) to put an initiative on the ballot in the state of Missouri for the 2008 election to preemptively ban most human engineering (Elliot Institute 2009).",

Legislators unfamiliar with complex scientific issues are likely to include errors or ambiguities in legislation that may not become apparent until well after enactment. For example, in response to the public outcry about the cloning of Dolly, many state legislators enacted poorly defined and structured legislation that inadvertently had the effect of criminalizing virtually all genomic and biotechnology research (by prohibiting cloning of any person, cell or molecule) or having natural monozygotic twins (by prohibiting creation of genetically identical individuals) (Greely 1998). Legislation to ban human cloning has been introduced in at least twenty-six states with at least 14 different definitions of human cloning being used (Greely 1998; See NCSL 2008). In five states (Indiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and New York), proposed legislation defined human cloning as the \u201cgrowing or creation of a human being from a single cell or cells of a genetically identical human being through asexual reproduction\u201d (Greely 1998). The definition used in those bills applies more directly to botanical rather than human cloning, in which a cutting from a parent plant is used to create genetically identical offspring. This definition does not, however, prohibit cloning via somatic cell nuclear transfer, as was intended. Beyond that, the language of this bill appears to criminalize the creation of monozygotic twins, surely not what the legislators intended.",

Thus, banning certain areas of scientific research may make the world more, not less, dangerous (Freitas 2006). Similarly, while embryonic stem cell research is morally objectionable to many people because it involves the destruction of human embryos, advances in embryonic research have produced promising breakthroughs that may permit the isolation of embryonic stem cells without the need to destroy embryos, thus alleviating many of the ethical objections to such technologies (Devolder 2006; President\u2019s Council on Bioethics 2005).",

The Delaney Clause prohibited any food additive that was \u201cfound to induce cancer in man, or, after tests, found to induce cancer in animals.\u201d At the time the clause was enacted, carcinogens were viewed as relatively rare substances that could be completely eliminated from the human diet. Soon thereafter, though, evolving scientific knowledge suggested that at least half of all chemicals could cause some form of cancer in animal tests at very high doses, and that almost every food additive and most \u201cnatural\u201d foods contained some level of potential carcinogens at trace levels. Regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) attempted to circumvent the harsh, extreme language of the Delaney Clause by suggesting that additives with trivial cancer risks should be exempted, but were repeatedly rejected by the courts that insisted only Congressional action could change the outdated assumptions underlying the Delaney Clause (Merrill 1988).

Any issue involving science, ethics and policy is likely to become a \u201cpolitical football\u201d in the regulatory venue, which can produce an outcome that is partisan, unpredictable, or overly broad (Wolf 1997). One example is the effort by many members of Congress in 2001 and subsequent years to hold hostage proposed legislation to prohibit reproductive cloning, a ban which is almost universally supported, unless and until a more controversial ban on therapeutic cloning is also enacted simultaneously. Another example is the lengthy delay of the FDA to approve over-the-counter sales of the \u201cmorning after\u201d birth-control pill based apparently on ideological and political reasons. Perhaps because of the potential for partisanship, courts have been very skeptical of legislators relying on general ethical and moral concerns as a legitimate rational for restricting the rights of others (Irwin 2005).

The first motivation applies to \u201cdual-use\u201d research that has both constructive and destructive applications. This research in and of itself is not morally objectionable, but because the research results could potentially be used inadvertently or deliberately to harm society, some would argue that the research should not be conducted at all, even at the cost of sacrificing the potentially beneficial uses of the research. A prototypical example is research involving the smallpox vaccine, which could be used to better understand and protect against a future smallpox outbreak, but also could be used by terrorists to launch a more deadly bioterrorism attack.",

For dual-use research, there is generally little disagreement that the beneficial uses of a technology are desirable and the destructive uses are not. The controversy is about the relative likelihood and weighing of the constructive and destructive applications, and how risk adverse society should be to the destructive applications. For morally objectionable research, on the other hand, the debate tends to focus instead on whether the very conduct of the research is moral or not. Of course these distinctions are not absolute, but they do suggest that different approaches may be needed for addressing the two categories of controversial research.",

            "text": "One obvious option for addressing dual-use research is that instead of trying to block the science altogether, society could seek to manage and control the undesirable applications of the knowledge while allowing the beneficial applications. In other words, society could regulate scientific knowledge in the same way other potentially harmful products such as automobiles, firearms and dynamite are regulated. As one prominent scientist recently wrote, \u201cAlthough some controls on technology may be sensible, the research lab isn\u2019t the place to put them: it\u2019s just too difficult to predict which scientific discovery will later lead to good applications or bad ones\u2026The scientist\u2019s job is to shine light in the darkness, and if we occasionally burn our fingers on the candle, so be it\u201d (Anderson 2006). The NRC report, Biotechnology Research in an Age of Terrorism, concluded that \u201cthe key issue\u201d with respect to dual-use research \u201cis whether the risks associated with misuse can be reduced while still enabling critical research to go forward\u201d (National Research Council (NRC) 2003). The report provides a series of recommendations involving education, oversight, and reporting to achieve this objective. Nevertheless, there may be some technologies whose potential misuse would be so likely and pernicious that allowing the technology to be developed unfettered and then trying to control its misuse may not be acceptable. And of course, this approach will not work for morally objectionable research, where it is the research itself rather then the potential applications that is problematic.",

            "text": "Another approach for dual-use research is to restrict the publication of scientific results rather than prohibiting the science from being undertaken. For example, research on sequencing the genome of a pathogenic organism could be conducted and relevant findings reported, without publishing the entire sequence of the genome that could potentially be used by terrorists to create or modify the organism using the sequence data (Kurzweil and Joy 2005). This approach would allow society to still obtain the benefits of dual use research, while minimizing risks of maleficent uses of that same knowledge by restricting dissemination of the information to those with appropriate credentials and/or a need to know. Some research institutions, scientific societies and journals have already put in place policies to restrict publication in certain extreme circumstances (Bhattacharjee 2006; Congressional Research Service 2006) and the National Scientific Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) has been charged with recommending whether some types of federally-funded research should be subject to publication restrictions (Fox 2005). The NSABB released a draft report in 2007 recommending that dual use research \u201cof concern\u201d be reviewed prior to publication, and in rare cases where the risks of disclosure exceed the benefits, the publication should be restricted by either: (i) adding information that explains the context of the research; (ii) modifying the manuscript to delete sensitive material; (iii) delaying publication; (iv) limiting distribution of publications to qualified experts or those who \u201cneed to know,\u201d; or (v) foregoing any communication and publication (NSABB 2007).",

Legal restrictions that allow the research to proceed but within certain limits, such as the protection of human subjects or research animals, are already in place to channel research in more morally acceptable directions, and indeed to prohibit the most reprehensible research. Various types of \u201cinformal constraints\u201d including peer pressure exerted through \u201cunspoken rules\u201d shared by a research community, the fear of social sanctions such as [or] like the potential for stirring up controversy by activist groups or journalists, and the researcher\u2019s own moral standards all play a role in constraining controversial scientific research (Kempner et al. 2005). Another important tool is the adoption of consensus codes and guidelines (Jones 2007; Somerville and Atlas 2005). Self-regulation has the benefit of being more flexible and adaptive to changing or unforeseen contexts (Malakoff and Enserink 2003). Scientists are generally very cognizant of their professional reputation and standing among their peers, and responsible scientists are likely to adhere to codes and guidelines promulgated by credible scientific institutions such as the National Academy of Sciences (Epstein 2001; Goldberg 1994). Recent examples of such scientific self-regulatory initiatives include the code of practice recommended for stem cell research by the NRC, which discourages certain types of research such as putting human embryonic stem cells in primate brains (National Research Council (NRC) 2005), and the oversight framework for synthetic biology suggested by a group of leading scientific and industry experts in that field (Bugl et al. 2007). Such non-legalistic codes and guidelines can help create what Gerald Epstein describes as a \u201cculture of responsibility\u201d in the scientific community (Fox 2005).",

As Daniel Sarewitz observed:We know that scientists negotiate not only with nature to advance knowledge, but with each other, with their funders, with politicians, corporate executives, various publics. We know that the directions and velocities of science reflect decisions made by people, and decisions emerge within a context. We know that context is strongly embodied by the institutions where science is conducted and planned. \u2026[I]t seems unavoidable to me that responsibility must be located in the processes by which decisions about science are made and implemented in the institutions of public science, rather than in the motives and norms of individuals who conduct science (Sarewitz 2006).\n",

Further, it has been noted that researchers vary in interpretation of what constitutes ethical research behavior, which has resulted in a call for development of ethical guidelines by scientific societies to prevent scientific misconduct and the \u201cnormalization of deviance\u201d by scientists (AAAS 2000).

Specifically, major scientific organizations and most individual scientists have recognized the importance of public trust and risk perceptions of the public, and have responded by getting involved in the discussion of how to best inform the public, how to make decisions regarding scientific research comply with the desires and concerns of the public (AAAS 2007; Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy 1995), and which types of scientific misconduct should be punishable (Korenman et al. 1998). An evaluation of scientist focus group responses has suggested that scientists value honesty, integrity, service, sharing, openness, mentoring, and meticulous work habits. The data also suggested that scientist participants perceived that the greatest harm from public disclosure of scientist misconduct is a loss of public trust and funding (Wenger et al. 1997). Generally, there is a strong awareness by scientists that their freedom from content-based regulation and restrictions depends in large part on their own actions in ensuring that they and their colleagues proceed in an ethical and socially responsible manner (Atkinson 1978), an awareness which has resulted in growing interest and support of many scientific leaders and societies for scientific codes of ethics in an attempt to foster research integrity (Atlas 2002; Somerville and Atlas 2005).
