All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethics Review Committees of Animal Experiments of International Medical Center of Japan. Aliquots of 100 \u03bcg of purified proteins/animal were used for vaccination of rabbits or KM mice [23], transgenic animals that produce fully human antibodies, with Freund's adjuvant (Difco Laboratories). To produce human monoclonal antibodies, the spleen cells from KM mice vaccinated with the S791 fragment were fused with the mouse myeloma cell line SP2/O-Ag14, and hybridomas were screened for their ability to bind to recombinant S791 protein by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described elsewhere [23]. Mass production of 5H10 was performed in fed-batch culture of CHO cells, as described elsewhere [25]. Epitope mapping of mAbs was performed using a set of overlapping peptides (>70% purity) spanning the entire sequence of the S791 protein, each consisting of 15 amino acids overlapping the next peptide by 5 amino acids, as described elsewhere [24].",

The neutralizing activities of mAbs against SARS-CoV Frankfurt01 were determined by plaque reduction assay. Monolayers of Vero E6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum in 6-well plates at 37\u00b0C with 5% carbon dioxide. Samples (100 mL) of 5H10 were incubated with an equal volume of SARS-CoV suspension (containing 200 plaque-forming units of virus) in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Samples of the incubated mixture were used to infect Vero E6 monolayers. After adsorption for 1 h, the cultures were overlaid with 1% methylcellulose-containing media and incubated for 6\u20138 days at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then fixed with 20% formalin, stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 0.1 M citric acid, and irradiated with UV light for 1 h. After drying, the numbers of virus plaques were counted. The neutralizing titer was defined as the reciprocal dilution of serum causing a 50% reduction in the plaque count, compared with the negative control. In the neutralization assay against SARS-CoV PUMC01, cell monolayers were stained with 100 \u03bcL of 0.15% neutral red (Sigma) in DMEM for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing, 100 \u03bcL of acid alcohol (1% acetic acid in 50% ethanol) was added to each well. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance of neutral red-stained plates was read at 450 nm.",

In contrast, 5H10 reacted with a peptide corresponding to amino acid positions 791 to 805 of the S protein (PLKPTKRSFIEDLLF) (data not shown). The latter peptide was identical to that recognized by the serum samples from convalescing patients with SARS in Vietnam [9]. Furthermore, the amino acid R797 is the trypsin proteolytic site to enhance fusion of the virus [8]. Among the 3 mAbs, only 5H10 showed in vitro SARS-CoV neutralizing activity, and the 50% effective concentration was 5 \u03bcg/mL (Supplemental Fig. 1d).

After cell\u2013cell fusion mediated by S and ACE2, the dual-luciferase reporter system was activated and the amount of cell\u2013cell fusion could be quantified. Because treatment with trypsin enhances cell\u2013cell fusion via cleavage of a site located in the S791 region [10, 27], fusion efficiency of the cells treated with EDTA only was compared with that of cells treated with EDTA and trypsin in the presence or absence of 5H10 (Figure 1a). When S-expressing cells were detached from culture dishes by treatment with trypsin in addition to EDTA, cellular fusion reflected by relative fluorescence was significantly increased in comparison with detachment by EDTA only. Cell fusion was strongly inhibited by 5H10 but not human IgG when cells were treated with the antibodies after detachment from the dishes. In contrast, 5H10 did not show inhibition of cell fusion when added before detachment from the dishes.",

Addition of 5H10 during trypsin treatment did not significantly affect generation of the 90-kDa fragment.

This sequence is highly conserved among not only SARS-CoV strains from patients but also among CoV strains in general [28] and contains a critical cleavage site, which induces exposure of the fusion peptide on cleavage [10, 28]. 5H10 inhibited cell-cell fusion mediated by the interaction between S and ACE2 even in the presence of trypsin, although the inhibition was not effective if cells were treated with 5H10 before detachment by trypsin in addition to EDTA. Indeed, 5H10 did not efficiently inhibit the cleavage and reacted with cleaved S. Our observations suggested that 5H10 prevents viral fusion and entry into the host cells but not viral attachment to the host cells or cleavage of S. Antibodies recognizing epitopes located in the ACE2-binding domain induced antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV entry into the host cells when the amino acid sequences of the S proteins were changed [13, 14]. Our results indicated that targeting of the S protein region involved in mediating viral fusion would provide a feasible strategy to produce neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, which is robust to mutation of the virus. Because synergistic effects of combinations of mAbs directed toward the ACE2 binding domain of S have been reported [15, 29], 5H10 directed toward the S cleavage site may serve as an alternative combination to provide stronger synergistic effects.",
