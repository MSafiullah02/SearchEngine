The world is becoming a global community, and a public health event in one geographic region or nation often affects the health and economy beyond that region, sometimes even globally. China has 34 provincial-level administrative regions and 2856 counties, which are covered by urban and rural health systems. The urban health system comprises hospitals of three different levels, disease control and prevention centers, and health authorities, while the rural health system includes county hospitals, health and epidemic prevention stations, and maternal and child health stations. As China has one fourth of the global population and has close ties with other countries through travel and trade, public health events in the country can have an important impact on distant populations in other countries, and the control of infectious diseases in China implies the control of infectious diseases in the world to a large extent.1 China is a major contributor to the spread and control of infectious diseases in the world. For example, the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) arose in 2002 in Guangdong, China, and was transmitted to Hong Kong, and then to other countries.2 The goose/Guangdong/1/1996 H5N1 virus found in a goose farm in southern China in 1996 is considered the precursor of the currently circulating highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses in more than 60 countries.3\n",

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is transmitted by the mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus in northern China, and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus in southern China.34 Water birds, especially herons and egrets are the main animal reservoirs, and pigs are important amplifier hosts, from which JEV can be transmitted to humans and other vertebrates by the bites of mosquitoes.35\n",
