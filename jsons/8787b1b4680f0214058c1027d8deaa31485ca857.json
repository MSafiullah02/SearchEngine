            "text": "Spinal epidural empyema (SEE) is an accumulation of purulent material in the epidural space of the vertebral canal that causes spinal cord dysfunction due to mechanical compression and inflammation. In human SEE, most infections are bacterial with a minority of abscesses caused by mycobacteria, fungi or parasites (Reihsaus et al. 2000) . Human SEE is a rare medical emergency and accounts for 0\u20222 to 2/10,000 hospital admissions (Grieve et al. 2000) . It is even more rarely reported in animals, the majority have been in dogs (Remedios et al. 1996 , Jerram & Dewey 1998 , Cherrone et al. 2002 , Nykamp et al. 2003 , Lavely et al. 2006 , Cross et al. 2008 , Sutton et al. 2010 , Monteiro et al. 2016 ) and it has also been reported in two cats (Granger et al. 2007 , Maeta et al. 2010 . Clinical signs in dogs and cats are comparable to those in humans, varying from fever, spinal hyperaesthesia to spinal cord dysfunction (Hanigan et al. 1990 , Rigamonti et al. 1999 , Grieve et al. 2000 , Reihsaus et al. 2000 , Curry Jr et al. 2005 , Duarte & Vaccaro 2013 . Routes of infection include haematogenous spread, contiguous infections from adjacent tissues, direct inoculation and migration of foreign bodies or aberrant parasites (Reihsaus et al. 2000 , Curry Jr et al. 2005 , Barrs et al. 2007 , Monteiro et al. 2016 . Rapid progression of clinical signs is possible and delayed diagnosis and treatment may result in permanent neurological dysfunction and higher mortality. In humans surgical decompression combined with antimicrobial therapy has been the treatment of choice although there have been reports of successful treatment with antibiotics alone in selected patients (Rigamonti et al. 1999 , Grieve et al. 2000 , Soehle & Wallenfang 2002 , Curry Jr et al. 2005 , Duarte & Vaccaro 2013 . Here we describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatments and outcomes of four cats with SEE diagnosed in a private clinic from 2010 to 2016. The clinic received about 17,000 feline cases during this period, of which around 550 were neurological. The prevalence of spinal epidural empyema was therefore 0\u202202% of all feline patients and 0\u20227% of the neurologically affected cats.",

Diagnosis of SEE is greatly facilitated by the increased (CT, MRI) . In humans, the combination of back pain and abnormal inflammation parameters (e.g. leukocytosis, accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is considered characteristic of SEE. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the imaging modality of choice over conventional radiography or CT-myelography as this provides a 91% sensitivity in diagnosing SEE in human patients, helps to identify alternative lesions and avoids lumbar or cerebellomedullary cisternal puncture during myelography, thus minimising the risk of iatrogenic intrathecal contamination (Reihsaus et al. 2000 , Curry Jr et al. 2005 . In humans, the characteristics of SEE MR images include hyperintense extradural lesion on T2-weighted images, generalised or ring contrast enhancement after iv injection of gadolinium-based agent on T1-weighted images, changes in adjacent tissue such as discospondylitis, epaxial muscle changes and sinus tracts (Rigamonti et al. 1999 , Reihsaus et al. 2000 , Curry Jr et al. 2005 , Duarte & Vaccaro 2013 . Similar MR changes were reported in canine SEE cases (Holloway et al. 2009 , Carrera et al. 2011 ) and hyperintensity within the spinal cord grey matter at the site of the lesion was reported in all five dogs in one case series (De Stefani et al. 2008) . Nevertheless, there are no reliable MRI changes that would differentiate SEE from a possible neoplasm. Histopathological examination of the abnormal tissue remains crucial to reach a definitive diagnosis.",

Myelography located the extradural compression but did not provide information on the extradural material, the spinal cord itself and the surrounding tissue. Low-field MRI was performed in Case 4 and high-field MRI in Case 3. In both cases, extradural lesions appeared as mixed-or high-signal material in T2-weighted images and showed diffuse strong contrast enhancement, comparable with MR features in humans and dogs. These changes were not apparent on survey radiography. Therefore MRI is considered superior in diagnosing SEE to myelography.",

CSF was collected in three cases in this study and the results were non-specific. With the increased availability of high-field MRI, a standardised diagnostic procedure for SEE should be recommended to include MRI (T2-weighted, T1-weighted with postcontrast sequences), urine and blood bacterial culture and sensitivity testing.

In Case 1, at the time of surgery and tissue collection no bacterial culture was submitted because feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was suspected and antibiotics were given before sample collection. The cat subsequently had negative PCR for coronavirus and continued to improve following treatment, making FIP extremely unlikely. For human and dog SEE the most frequently isolated causative bacteria are Staphyloccocus and Streptococcus species , Rigamonti et al. 1999 , Grieve et al. 2000 , Reihsaus et al. 2000 , Cherrone et al. 2002 , Soehle & Wallenfang 2002 , Curry Jr et al. 2005 , Duarte & Vaccaro 2013 . In the cervical SEE reported in one cat, Pasteurella multocida was cultured (Granger et al. 2007 ). However there was negative yield on culture in the other cat despite a large amount of bacteria identified on cytological examination of the epidural tissue (Maeta et al. 2010) . In a recent literature review of human SEE, no microbiological diagnosis was identified despite blood and intraoperative cultures in 13% of patients (Suppiah et al. 2016) . In another study of human SEE, the early use of antibiotics before culture and insufficient tissue for bacteria culture were suggested reasons leading to 24\u20224% cases with an unidentified causative pathogen and up to 50% of negative blood cultures (Ma & Kim 2012) . Histopathological examination revealing an inflammatory extradural lesion is highly diagnostic of SEE (Cases 1, 2 and 3). Real-time PCR for bacterial species DNA, performed on EDTA anti-coagulated plasma and freshly excised portions of the extradural lesion may be more sensitive in reaching a definitive diagnosis (Cross et al. 2008) .",
