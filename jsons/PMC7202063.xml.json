            "text": "The Beira antelope Dorcatragus megalotis was first described in 1894 (von Menges, 1894). However, little appears to have been known about the biology and life history of this remarkable small antelope species; for example, in a renowned paper on the behaviour of antelopes, Jarman (1974) did not know how to classify the social behaviour of this species. Detailed descriptions of the biology of Beira antelope have only occurred very recently (2008, 2005). Beira antelope originate from East Africa; their area of distribution is the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden to the Horn of Africa in the east, to the borders of Somalia, Ethiopia and Djibouti in the west, and to the Marmar Mountains in north\u2010eastern Ethiopia (2008, 1998, 1999). Their typical habitat is arid mountain with sparse vegetation, where they inhabit altitudes of up to 2000 m in small, territorial groups (Giotto et al., 2008; C. Hammer, pers. obs). Beira antelope belong to the Neotragini, the dwarf antelopes, and are considered related to the Steenbok Raphicerus campestris and grysbok (Raphicerus spp), the dikdiks (Madoqua spp) and the Oribi Ourebia ourebi. The scientific name Dorcatragus megalotis is of Greek origin and means \u2018big\u2010eared antelope\u2019 (Huffman, 2009).",

Most animals died because of malnutrition, heat, and parasitic and infectious diseases. From before 1999, no detailed records exist about the number of imported animals and their fate. In March 1999, 25 Beira antelope were captured during an expedition to Somalia (in the area of Hargeisa) and flown to Qatar. At this time, 1.3 (\u2642.\u2640) animals were still alive at AWWP from previous expeditions. By July 1999, only 2.6 adult animals were still alive and these represent the founding stock for the current AWWP population: the only ex situ population to date. Descriptions presented here are based on observations of this population and on free\u2010ranging animals during a field trip to Djibouti in 2003.",

The most recent estimates are based on field observations from 2004 in Djibouti (2008, 2009), where the political situation has stabilized since 1997 so that field observations are possible. The Beira antelope is classified as Vulnerable (2008, 2009). Protected areas or in situ programmes do not exist to date. Since 1997, there is a general hunting ban in Djibouti that also benefits the Beira antelope.",

A certain seasonality appears evident in the captive population (Fig. 1) but, generally, Beira belong to those antelopes that appear to lose their naturally seasonal breeding pattern when kept in captivity (Piening Schuler, Hammer, Clauss & Hammer, 2009). Most \u2640\u2640 mate quickly after birth and, hence, have the next calf c. 6\u00b75 months later. Only primiparous \u2640\u2640 at AWWP have a longer first interbirth interval of 10\u201312 months, whereas this interval is 6\u00b75\u20138 months in multiparous dams.",

First signs of labour are usually observed 90 minutes before birth. The actual expulsion usually lasts 20 minutes. As in other ruminants, anterior presentation of the calf, with forelegs and head appearing first, is the norm. Mothers often get into tactile contact with the calf while the latter is still in the birth canal. Usually, mothers start cleaning their young directly after birth. Beira antelope calves are fully developed and precocious. They try to stand immediately after birth. Calves usually reach a standing position 20\u201340 minutes after birth and start searching for their mother's udder, which usually does not take longer than another 10 minutes. Beira antelope calves are hiders (remain hidden and separated from their mother except during nursing periods) and are visited by their mothers for nursing only. The placenta is usually ejected 30\u201360 minutes after birth and directly ingested by the mother; however, only partial consumption or complete neglect of the placenta also occurred at AWWP.",

The house is equipped with air conditioning, which is considered essential at temperatures above 35 \u00b0C. Animals have permanent access to the outdoor enclosure and the house. As the antelope did not use bedding material this is no longer offered except in cases of illness or exceptional cold. In these cases, infrared heaters are installed indoors and are regularly used by the animals. In the colder months (December to March), animals are locked indoors overnight and houses are heated with electric heaters. Ambient temperature is maintained at 20 \u00b0C.",

The amount of food taken from this growing vegetation is minimal as compared with the diet offered. Note that the diet offered comprises a large proportion of browse (Table 2). Food is offered twice daily (Table 3). Browse twigs and fresh lucerne are hung from fences or mesh protecting vegetation in the enclosure; the other feeds are given in elevated food bowls of varying height that are distributed around the enclosure (an important measure for limiting access to food by rats and mice). A high number of these bowls and their distribution across the enclosure encourages the animals to spend more time foraging and allows individuals of lower status to access food at the same time as the dominant animals. Apart from the mineral licks and the minerals available via the compound feeds, an additional mineral mix is fed to the animals, either mixed into the fruits and vegetables, or dissolved in water and sprayed onto the browse.",

Main symptoms are nasal discharge, coughing and eye infections, with arthritis in some individuals. During necropsy, fibrinous pleuropneumonia, kidney abnormalities and amyloidosis are evident. We know today that the cause of FPPS is a mycoplasma infection (Nagy et al., 2008), most likely without the involvement of a viral infection (Lechenne et al., 2009). Because the infectious agent has not been identified, a prophylactic vaccination is not possible. Attempts to hand\u2010raise neonates isolated immediately from their mothers to establish an infection\u2010free population (Piening Schuler, Hammer & Hammer, 2009) have been unsuccessful to date; however, because these animals were cooperative they were easy to treat. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The syndrome led to a crash of the captive population (Fig. 7). The most recent neonates are left with their mothers but are treated continuously with antibiotics during their first 2 months of life. To date, these animals do not show any symptoms.
