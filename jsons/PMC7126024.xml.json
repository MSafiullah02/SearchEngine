The 5-trifluoromethoxy (3c), 5-amino (3d) and 5-acetylamino (3e) analogs were less active or inactive in the three cell lines. These data suggested that strong electron withdrawing, or hydrophilic, or large groups are not favored at the 5-position. The 4-chloro analog 3f was >2-fold more potent than 2a in all the three cell lines, indicating that a small group at the 4-postion might increase potency. Combination of substitutions at both the 4- and 5-positions led to the 4-bromo-5-methyl analog 3g that was highly potent with an EC50 value of 0.24 \u03bcM in HCT116 cells, >40-fold more potent than 2a. The 4,5-dichloro analog 3h also was highly active. Interestingly, 5-methyl-4-phenyl analog 3i was inactive up to 20 \u03bcM, indicating that a large group is not tolerated at 4-position. 5,6-Di-substituted analogs (3j and 3k) and 5,7-di-substituted analogs (3l and 3m) were found to have low activity or inactive, suggesting that substitutions at the 6- and 7-positions may not be preferred.",
