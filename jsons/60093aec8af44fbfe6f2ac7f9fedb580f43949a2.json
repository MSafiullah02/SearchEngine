Six cynomolgus monkeys were inoculated with the HKU39849 isolate of SARS-CoV via four routes. After intranasal inoculation, the virus was isolated from respiratory swabs on days 2-7 postinoculation (p.i.) and virus genome was detected in intestinal tissues on day 7 p.i. Virus was not detected after intragastric inoculation. After intravenous inoculation, infectious virus was isolated from rectal swabs, and virus antigen was detected in intestinal cells on day 14 p.i. After intratracheal (i.t.) inoculation, virus antigen-positive alveolar cells and macrophages were found in lung and infectious virus was detected in lymphoid and intestinal tissues. The peribronchial lymph nodes showed evidence of an immune response. Lung tissue and \u2044 or fluid and \u2044 or the peribronchial lymph node of the intratracheally inoculated animals had high TNF-a, IL-8 and IL-12 levels. SARS lung lesions are only generated in monkeys by i.t. inoculation. The virus appears to spread into and perhaps via the intestinal and lymphatic systems. It has been suggested previously that viraemia may cause intestinal infections in SARS patients.",

Fever, myalgia, coughing and a sore throat characterize the first week and are followed in the second week by frequent recurrence of fever, diarrhoea and hypoxaemia. Half of the patients show chest radiographic abnormalities. IgG seroconversion to SARS-CoV occurs on days 10-15 and correlates with decreased viral loads. Some patients show clinical worsening at this stage. Researchers have suggested that immunopathological damage from an over-exuberant host response, not uncontrolled viral replication, causes the lung damage at this stage (Nicholls et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003a; Wong et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2004) .",

These monkeys also develop a human SARS-like pneumonia Kuiken et al. 2003; Rowe et al. 2004; Greenough et al. 2005) . However, only minimal disease is observed 14 days after infection, and some researchers concluded that the monkey model may be of limited utility in the study of SARS and the development of effective therapies (McAuliffe et al. 2004; Rowe et al. 2004) . Nevertheless, these animal models may still be useful for understanding early events of SARS-CoV infection in vivo. Consequently, we here inoculated cynomolgus monkeys with SARS-CoV via the i.n., i.t., intravenous (i.v.) or intragastric (i.g.) routes and determined their clinical, pathological and virological profiles. We found that only the i.t. route induced lung infection and pathology, and that from the primary infection site the virus can spread through the body to and perhaps via the intestinal and lymphatic systems.",

Virus-positive cells in its lung and SARS-CoV antigen in its alveolar macrophages and type I and type II alveolar epithelia were revealed (Figure 3e ,f). Moreover, virus was isolated from its lung tissue (10 4.5 TCID 50 \u2044 ml in 10% homogenate) and bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid (10 2.5 TCID 50 \u2044 ml). With regard to other tissues, infectious virus and \u2044 or virus genome was detected in the peribronchial and mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and small and large intestine of #4589 (Table 2) . Moreover, its peribronchial lymph node evinced oedema and histiocytes in the sinus (Figure 3g ,h). That infectious virus was detected in the colon and lymph nodes of #4589 (Table 2) suggests that the virus may spread to lymphoid and gastrointestinal tissues after its initial replication in the lung.",

After i.v. inoculation, #4593 again failed to show infectious virus and \u2044 or viral genome in swabs over the 7 days before its sacrifice (Figure 1e and 2e) . The only postmortem tissue with the SARS-CoV genome was the spleen, and infectious virus was not detected anywhere (Table 2) .

On day 7 p.i., a few repairing columnar epithelial cells in the nasal cavity were seen in #4591 (i.n. with 10 6 TCID 50 ) (a, HE; \u00b7100). SARS-CoV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of these cells by using a high-sensitivity IHC technique as described in the Materials and methods [b, Catalysed Signal Amplification (CSA); \u00b7100].

Syncytia (asterisk) and enlarged type 2 pneumocytes (arrowheads) were seen in the bronchiole lumen of #4589 (e, HE; \u00b7100). SARS-CoV antigen-positive cells in the lung of #4589 were alveolar macrophages and probably type 2 pneumocytes (arrowheads) (f, IHC; \u00b7100). The peribronchial lymph node of #4589 (i.t. with 10 8 TCID 50 ) had an enlarged sinus with histiocyte proliferation and oedema and its germinal centre was unclear (g, HE; \u00b725, h, HE; \u00b7100). Focal repairing fibroplasias were observed in the lower lobe of the lung of #4590 on day 21 p.i. (i, HE; \u00b75). The alveolar wall was thick with proliferating fibroblasts (j, HE; \u00b7100). In the peribronchial lymph node of #4590 (i.t. with 10 8 TCID 50 ), B-cell proliferation and follicular hyperplasia were observed (k, HE; \u00b725; l, HE; \u00b7100). No histopathological changes were seen in the lung of #4593 (i.v. with 10 8 TCID 50 ) on day 7 p.i. (m, HE; \u00b75, n, HE; \u00b7100). In the peribronchial lymph node of #4593 (i.v. with 10 8 TCID 50 ), the germinal centre was unclear and strong T-cell proliferation was detected (o, HE; \u00b725; p, HE; \u00b7100). No histopathological changes were observed in the rectal mucosa of #4594 (i.v. with 10 8 TCID 50 ) (q, HE; \u00b7100) but SARS-CoV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of these cells by using the CSA method (r, CSA; \u00b7100).

However, none of the monkeys developed SARS-like signs and symptoms, regardless of the inoculation route. Virus infection, replication and elimination occurred in the respiratory tracts during the 2-week period after inoculation (#4590, #4592 and #4594). The different virological, histopahtological, and immunological results of the two animals in each group (between #4589 and #4590, #4591 and #4592) depended on when the animals were sacrificed after inoculation. These results support previous reports in which monkeys were used for respiratory inoculation Kuiken et al. 2003; McAuliffe et al. 2004; Rowe et al. 2004; Greenough et al. 2005; Qin et al. 2005) . Thus, the model is useful for studying early events in SARS-CoV infection and replication. Additionally, these infected animals showed distinct virological responses depending on Figure 5 Levels of cytokines in lung wash fluid and in lung and peribronchial lymph node tissue homogenates obtained from inoculated monkeys.

These results suggest that these responses play an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV infection. In the i.t.-inoculated animals, the initial infection of the respiratory system was followed by infection of the lymphatic and intestinal tissues. Similarly, the i.n.-inoculated animals had infectious virus in their nasal swabs, stomach and deep cervical lymph node, while the i.v.-inoculated animals had infectious virus in their faeces. Thus, after SARS-CoV infection of the respiratory tract, the virus replicates in the nasal cavity epithelium or alveolar epithelium of the lower respiratory tract. The replicated virus is then excreted continuously for several days by the throat or nasal mucosa, after which the virus infects the intestinal and lymphatic systems. Although gastric acid may inactivate the enveloped virus, the infectious virus was nevertheless detected in the intestinal tract of the monkeys regardless of the route of inoculation (Table 2 ). Thus, it is possible that SARS-CoV viraemia may lead to infection in the intestinal mucosa and replication there that results in the excretion of virus into the faeces. As the infectious virus was also detected in the lymphoid system of the i.t. and i.n. inoculated monkeys (Table 2) , it may be the lymphatic system may also play an important role in the spread of the virus within the host.",

Significantly, the i.t.-inoculated monkeys had high IL-8 and TNF-a levels in the lung and peribronchial lymph node that were probably elicited by activated alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Thus, IL-8 \u2044 TNF-a-producing immunological responses may eliminate the virus from the respiratory tract early in infection. T-cells may also play important roles in preventing virus spreading, as all day 7-sacrificed monkeys had higher levels of the T-cell cytokines IL-2 and IFN-c in the lung wash than the animals sacrificed later. Molecules like IL-2, IFN-c IL-8 and TNF-a may also be partly responsible for the lung lesions in the i.t.-inoculated monkeys, as has been postulated for human SARS (Ware & Matthay 2000) .",
