When threats emanate from this transboundary space, national governments are often surprised and discover that existing crisis management arrangements do not suffice. This article describes the political and administrative challenges that accompany transboundary crises. It argues that arrangements and processes that work reasonably well for \"bounded\" crises are unlikely to work in the case of transboundary crises. It formulates an agenda for political debate and academic research. The bottom line is that we need to rethink traditional crisis management arrangements in order to prepare for these increasingly common type of threats.",

By decoupling from modernity, many crises simply cannot happen. The choice for decoupling does not come free, however. Withdrawal entails a decoupling from the benefits that complex systems generate. It is a costly affair, as economists are fond to explain. But this rational argumentation collides with the growing unease about the negative effects of modern systems. In times of uncertainty, the call for entrenchment behind hard borders may not be evidence based, but it is intuitively convincing and politically attractive.

It may well be that certain types are more politically or analytically challenging. The research challenge is to find out how characteristics relate to preparatory and management efforts.

Hard to chart: The root causes of a crisis that originated in another country or sector are difficult to comprehend. Causes are unclear, possible consequences seem uncertain, and escalation is unpredictable. When it is all over and the report on the crisis is written, it may become clear what happened (and how it could have been avoided). But during the crisis, it is extremely difficult to establish the most basic developments. The Transboundary Crisis brings rude surprises. 4. Multiple actors, conflicting responsibilities: The Transboundary Crisis does not fall neatly into a defined domain, with a clear division of tasks and responsibilities. The Transboundary Crisis challenges multiple actors with various responsibilities. It is not clear which actor is responsible for what or who has the capacities to perform certain tasks. The Transboundary Crisis blurs the organizational boundaries that normally facilitate an effective response. 5. No ready-made solutions: For most policy issues, possible solutions exist. They may be controversial or taken for granted. But it is usually clear what the discussion is or should be about. The Transboundary Crisis defies easy or conventional solutions.

Consider the cyber domain: It is rarely clear who or what is behind a cyber disruption; it is often even less clear who can do what to protect a critical system against a cyber attack.",
