New coronavirus nucleic acid testing (NAT) by real-time fluorescent RT-PCR was positive. His CT image revealed multiple ground glass opacities bilaterally, typical of COVID-19. On admission, the patient's arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 93% at rest. He did not have a history of smoking and any underlying medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His complete blood count showed leukocytes 6.44x10 9 /L (normal range 3.5-9.5x10 9 /L), neutrophils 5.55x10 9 /L (normal range 1.8-6.3x10 9 /L), lymphocyte 0.71x10 9 /L (normal range 1.1-3.2x10 9 /L), blood platelet 110x10 9 /L (normal range 125-350x10 9 /L).

CT image revealed multiple ground-glass opacities with parenchymal consolidation, pneumothorax on the right, Spontaneous rupture of a subpleural bulla is the cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. 3 Risk factors that contribute to the development of spontaneous pneumothorax include tobacco smoking, age, thin stature, male sex, low body mass index, prolonged cough, strenuous exercise and some diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum, usually a rare condition, refers to alveolar rupture due to an increase in intrathoracic pressure, followed by air dissection through the bronchovascular sheath into the mediastinum. 4 Subcutaneous emphysema occurs when air gets into tissues under the skin, with pneumothorax often being the cause.",

This case is a reminder that acute deterioration with rapid oxygen desaturation in a COVID-19 patient could indicate pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The best management of such cases remains unknown. In this case, we administered steroid therapy as we assumed a cytokine storm and the patient slowly improved and survived. However, the timing and the efficacy of steroid therapy in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia still remains elusive. With now more than 1.6 million COVID-19 cases globally, better data as a result of the WHO Solidarity trial 5 should become available soon.",
