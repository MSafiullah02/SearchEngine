Zsidisin 2003; Zsidisin et al. 2004; Zsidisin et al. 2000; Vidal a. Goetschalckx, 2000) . Companies traditionally use multiple sources for material procurement and/or hold safety stocks to avoid vulnerability. However, these strategies can negatively impact the supply chain performance, leading to higher purchase and logistics costs. The aim of this chapter is to illustrate how the implementation of the supply chain risk management concept can be improved by using a neural network approach.",

The occurrence of new risks such as uncertain demand, the increasing vulnerability of supply chains due to trends such as globalization, saturation of markets or terrorist attacks have forced companies to establish new concepts for risk assessment. It is therefore necessary to define a \"manageable\" security/risk level which is ultimately a socalled trade-off between supply chain costs, security and performance (e.g. taking on responsibility in the case of disruptions in supply chains). Thus the supply chain management concept has to be enhanced by methods of complexity and risk management. Figure 1 illustrates the trade-off between supply chain costs and supply chain security. Teufel a. Erat 2001, p. 216) In recent years, the notion of the term \"risk\" has been given greater attention in research on supply chain management both by academics and practitioners. It is worth mentioning that 100% security or a 0% probability of risk occurrence is not possible in real-life supply chain scenarios. The goal is to determine a \"manageable\" security/risk level (denoted point Opt in Fig. 1 ).",

In 2000, for example, a fire damaged the plant of Nokia's and Ericsson's main supplier, which delivers mobile phone components. For illustration, we classify this specific event \"Plant fire\" by means of our morphological box for disruption classification (see Table 2 ). In recent years, the so-called risk map (risk portfolio) is often used to assess risks in supply chains. Figure 5 illustrates such a risk map, containing four types of risk responses (action steps) with regard to the likelihood of risk occurrence and the risk impact: 1) Risk acceptance: Risks that occur very seldom and that have a small impact can be accepted. 2) Risk assurance (transfer): Certain risks can be transferred to assurance companies. 3) Make or buy (outsourcing): Risk management activities can be conducted by the company itself or can be outsourced to third-party logistics providers. 4) Activity: Risk can be mitigated by avoiding or reducing risky activities as well as by reducing and preventing risks (e.g. training and education of employees). The overall process of managing risks in supply chains is illustrated in Figure 6 . The risk strategy (1), the development of security guidelines and risk metrics (2) as well as the following factors strongly influence the supply chain risk management system (3) and the implementation, planning and scheduling of action steps (4):",

To determine the critical paths for each node and for each link in a supply network, a vector of risk metrics (see Table 3 ) has to be calculated. Nodes or edges (transport paths) are critical if their risk level is higher than a threshold value (e.g. risk level > 0.75), predefined in the risk strategy phase. For example, neural networks can be applied to calculate the probability of risk occurrence between the nodes of the supply network or at a specific node, as illustrated in Table 4 , taking various risk metrics as input vectors. In Table 4 , values with a risk level (probability of disruption occurrence) > 0.5 are highlighted in bold. In our example in Figure 7 and Table 4 , a critical path can be determined between Producer 2-1, Supplier 3-1 and Logistics provider 4-1, because the risk level for each node and link is > 0.5. After identifying and visualizing critical nodes and edges in supply networks, appropriate action steps have to be considered (e.g. acceptance, avoidance, reduction, prevention, transfer (assurance), make or buy). For this purpose, nodes and edges can be transformed and visualized into the risk map (cf. section 3) using the probability of risk (disruption) occurrence and the risk impact (both values estimated by means of neural networks (cf. next section) as the x-and y-axis.",

The first neural network model (perceptron) was developed by Rosenblatt in the late 1950s (Wassermann 1989). Since then, neural networks have been applied to various classification and prediction problems, for example in time series forecasting, stock market prediction, supply chain planning and pattern recognition (Bishop 1995; Bansal et al. 1998; Chiu a. Lin 2004; Vellidoa et al. 1999) . Neural networks that are inspired by biological nervous systems can be described as a directed, weighted graph consisting of three or more layers: one input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer (see Fig. 8 ). The arcs represent the weighted connections between the processing elements (nodes). The nodes of the neural network are called neurons, which operate in parallel. w ij is the weight of the connection between neuron i and neuron j. Figure 9 illustrates the three-step information processing sequence inside a neuron. Fig. 9 . Information processing in neurons (Wilbert 1996, p. 52) All inputs, which themselves are also outputs of previous neurons, are multiplied with the associated weights and aggregated to a single value net j , as shown in equation (1.1). This value net j is passed on to the activation function, as shown in equation (1.2). Commonly used types of activation and output functions, respectively, include linear, quadratic or sigmoid functions. The new activation state of a neuron is a result based on the previous state and the net input. In the last step, the newly calculated activation state is used to compute the final output o j , as shown in equation (1.3) . The input layer contains a number of elements that pass weighted inputs to the neurons of the hidden layer, according to the connection weights. Inputs to the neurons in our problem are risk metrics, as listed in Table 3 . The neurons in the hidden layer process their inputs and propagate their outputs to the output layer, which produces the network's response. Outputs in our case are the probability of risk occurrence or the risk impact calculated in the intervals [0, 1]. Commonly, neural networks are trained so that a particular input leads to a specific target output. This adjusting (training) process is called supervised learning. Training means adjusting the values of the connections (weights) between the neurons.",

These parts were delivered by two distribution centers, two local trans-shipment centers and an original equipment manufacturer. The selection of suppliers depends on their availability. Transport of helicopter parts is possible both by air and via seaway. Figure 10 illustrates the above-described supply network. In our experiments we anticipate the risk of orders by one node of the supply network via a specific transport way (airway, seaway).

The MSE is the sum of the squared differences between the desired output and the actual output of the output neurons averaged over all training exemplars. A small value (e.g. close to zero) indicates that the network has learned well and is suited to the classification problem. Risk metrics as outlined in Table 3 are coded and represented in Excel spreadsheets. Figure 11 shows an excerpt from such an Excel spreadsheet. Each row describes one input vector (risk profile).

For the hidden layers we applied sigmoid activation functions (see the first three columns in Table 5 ). Additionally, we chose an indifferent window by means of the following rule to improve classification accuracy: If output value > 0.75 then disruption will occur, else no disruption will occur at a supply network node/link. Correct classification means a disruption has occurred at a specific link or node in our simulation and the neural network has anticipated this disruption correctly (e.g. output value > 0.75). Correct classification also means that no disruption has occurred and the neural network has also diagnosed this case correctly. The test data (last column of table 3) are unknown and have not been presented as input vectors for the neural networks before. Thus, the classification rate is not as good as with training data. Our neural network training process was not as time-consuming as often claimed in the literature (in our experiments, it took less than ten minutes for 318 training data sets). Performance of the neural networks was also very good. Trained neural networks generate an output in less than 3 seconds when an unknown input vector with risk metrics is given as input for the input layer. Many other application scenarios of neural networks for supply chain risk management can also be considered. We are currently estimating suppliers' delivery times by means of neural networks and are ranking suppliers based on several supplier metrics (e.g. delivery costs, delivery time, etc.). Table 6 summarizes the pros and cons of our proposed neural network approach for supply chain risk management. ",

On the other hand, too few nodes reduce classification accuracy Correlations (interdependencies) between risk metrics (indicators) are difficult to detect by supply chain decision-makers. For this reason, a rule-based approach in supply chain risk management is not the first choice. Instead, neural networks are capable of learning from past disruptions and are more flexible than static ifthen rules (e.g. if delivery time is > 2 hours then\u2026). By applying our neural network approach supply network members can \u2022 understand the supply risk that exists, \u2022 proactively assess the probability and impact of supply risk in advance, \u2022 reactively learn from disruptions that occurred in the past and can thus improve their supply chain risk management system.",

The winner, an MLP with three hidden layers and 75 neurons per hidden layer, exhibited reasonable generalization capability. When exposed to new data sets (unknown risk profiles), it classified 86.6% on average correctly. Today, the automatic observation and management of disruptions and other irregularities in supply networks is generally limited to single supply chain members. The neural network approach presented in this chapter is intended to integrate data from single members so that all members can assess and visualize risk profiles.",
