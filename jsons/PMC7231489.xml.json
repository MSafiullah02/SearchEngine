As well as the described pulmonary thrombotic complications, a series of early circuit occlusions has been encountered in patients on hemofiltration as a consequence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome from SARS-CoV-2.",

Management has been dictated primarily by the severity of the organ dysfunction. A conservative approach with the prescription of therapeutic low-molecular-weight-heparin with subsequent conversion to a direct-acting oral anticoagulant has been an effective strategy.",
