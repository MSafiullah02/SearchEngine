            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a form of non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, due to alveolar injury secondary to an inflammatory process, that can be either pulmonary or systemic in origin. This syndrome presents as acute hypoxaemia with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging, which are not wholly due to heart failure. As a syndrome, it is characterised by the presence of several criteria. Since the original description by Ashbaugh and colleagues in 1967,1 four definitions have been used to determine the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (table\n).2, 3, 4, 5\n",

            "text": "The American European Consensus Conference definition,3 which was published in 1994, was the first agreed and widely used definition. However, it had numerous limitations across all four diagnostic criteria (panel\n), and, as a result, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine engaged in a consensus process to generate an improved definition for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The Berlin definition,5 which was published in 2012, was validated in over 4000 patients' data: on the basis of hypoxaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome is classified as mild (ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2] of 200\u2013\u2264300 mm Hg), moderate (PaO2/FiO2 100\u2013\u2264200 mm Hg), or severe (PaO2/FiO2 \u2264100 mm Hg). The most important updates to the definition are the stipulation of a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, (PEEP can increase oxygenation, which is a key criterion of the syndrome\u2014this update was to establish a minimum standard for mechanical ventilation); the acknowledgment that acute respiratory distress syndrome can be diagnosed in the presence of cardiac failure; a requirement for new respiratory failure, or worsening of chronic respiratory disease, within 7 days; and the inclusion of chest CT as an alternative form of imaging for the demonstration of lung infiltrates.PanelProblems with the AECC definition and subsequent Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome\nAcuity\n\n\u2022AECC: not specified\u2022Berlin: almost all patients meet criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome within a week15\n\n\nOxygenation\n\n\u2022AECC: no minimum requirement for PEEP, which can strongly modify oxygenation;16 differences in ratio of the PaO2 to the FiO2 across differing PEEP and FiO2\n16\n\u2022Berlin: level of PEEP not considered in determining severity17\n\n\nRadiography\n\n\u2022AECC: poor interobserver agreement on interpretation of chest radiographs, even between experts;18, 19 no standardised set of chest radiographs for comparison or education; difficult to differentiate hydrostatic from permeability pulmonary oedema on chest radiographs;20 consolidation might be visible on CT, but not by chest radiography21\n\n\nHeart failure\n\n\u2022AECC: unvalidated use of high pulmonary artery occlusion pressure to exclude alveolar injury as the cause of, or as a contributor to, pulmonary oedema in acute respiratory distress syndrome;22 poor medical and nursing knowledge of the correct interpretation of pulmonary artery catheter data;23, 24 high interobserver variability in interpretation of pulmonary artery catheter tracings;25 poor interobserver agreement on the clinical identification of left atrial hypertension\n\nAutopsy or biopsy studies\n\n\u2022Both: around 50% of patients meeting the definitions of acute respiratory distress syndrome do not have diffuse alveolar damage;8, 12, 14, 26 prevalence of diffuse alveolar damage decreases with rising PaO2/FiO2 ratio;13 only 75% of severely hypoxaemic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome have diffuse alveolar damage13\n\n\nDuration\n\n\u2022Both: patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome persisting <24 h have much better outcomes than do those with ARDS persisting >24 h27\n\n\nAcute lung injury term\n\n\u2022AECC: inconsistency with the use of the term acute lung injury, which has been used to refer to either patients with mild hypoxaemia only (PaO2 >200 mm Hg) or as an umbrella term for all those meeting the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome,5 including moderate and severe hypoxaemia\n\nRecognition\n\n\u2022Both: many clinicians fail to recognise acute respiratory distress syndrome6\n\nAECC=American European Consensus Conference.

In a randomised controlled trial45 of 150 critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, ventilation with 10 mL rather than 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight was associated with a five-times increase in the odds of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. This finding has been substantiated in a further randomised controlled trial48 in 400 patients at risk of pulmonary complications undergoing general anaesthesia for major abdominal surgery. A non-lung-protective ventilatory strategy of 10\u201312 mL/kg tidal volume ventilation with no PEEP was compared with lung-protective ventilation of 6\u20138 mL/kg tidal volume with PEEP of 6\u20138 cm H2O plus a recruitment manoeuvre every 30 min.

Alveolar vascular damage also occurs, with increased permeability coexisting with altered vasomotor tone (both vasoconstriction and vasodilation) and microthrombi. Pulmonary hypertension results, increasing right ventricular afterload. This right ventricular dysfunction can be further exacerbated by mechanical ventilation and fluid overload.

Volume-limited and pressure-limited ventilation can cause hypercapnic acidosis, and the overall clinical effect of protective ventilation and hypercapnia is uncertain.84 Hypercapnic acidosis could provide protective effects in the setting of high-tidal-volume ventilation, but a beneficial effect is not noted in patients receiving lung-protective ventilation.85\n",

These advantages should be weighed against the effects of raised intrathoracic pressure\u2014namely, decreased venous return and increased right ventricular afterload.86 Numerous methods of setting the PEEP level have been described, including most recently oesophageal balloon manometry.87 In the lung-protective era, four randomised controlled trials87, 88, 89, 90 have been done to answer the question of whether higher or lower pressure is superior, with a suggestion that higher PEEP could be beneficial.

Although 6 mL/kg tidal volume is recognised as low-tidal-volume ventilation, it is the normal tidal volume of most mammalian species.94 As the available functional lung volume falls in acute respiratory distress syndrome as a result of collapse and consolidation, perhaps the delivered tidal volume should also decrease. Although evidence suggests that targeting of driving pressure is prudent, whether driving pressure relates causally to outcome remains to be established in a prospective, randomised controlled trial. This concept is being investigated in the setting of studies of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal to facilitate very-low-tidal-volume or ultra-protective ventilation.95 Although these data for driving pressure are post hoc, observational in nature, and necessitate confirmation in a prospective study, an upper limit for driving pressure of 15 cm H2O could be appropriate in the interim.",

The authors of a 2015 Cochrane review, summarising three randomised controlled trials consisting of 1089 patients in total, concluded that evidence was insufficient to promote the use of either volume-controlled or pressure-controlled ventilation over the other.99 Airway-pressure-release ventilation is used for its ability to maintain a high mean airway pressure\u2014and thus maintain alveolar recruitment\u2014while permitting spontaneous ventilation. Unfortunately, the evidence base is limited by suboptimum control groups in the studies done and concerns about possible high tidal volume and mean airway pressure.100 Non-invasive ventilation can be tried in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome. A small study101 of 40 patients showed reduced requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation and a non-significant reduction in mortality with this approach. This result should be tempered by those of a much larger meta-analysis of 540 patients, documenting failure of non-invasive ventilation in almost 50% of patients.102 The advent of high-flow nasal oxygen allows for simpler, more tolerable respiratory support. In an observational study, 18 (40%) of 45 patients with moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (mean PaO2/FiO2 137 mm Hg) treated with high-flow nasal oxygen required invasive mechanical ventilation.103 As with non-invasive ventilation, more severe illness was associated with an increasing likelihood of treatment failure.",

Although prolonged prone positioning's association with physiological improvement was increasingly recognised,109 in these studies prone ventilation was of short duration. Additionally, subsequent meta-analyses110, 111 suggested benefit specifically in the most hypoxaemic patients receiving lung-protective ventilation. The PROSEVA study112 was designed to address these shortcomings. 466 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (which was defined as a PaO2 of less than 150 mm Hg while being ventilated with an FiO2 of 0\u00b76 or greater) who were receiving lung-protective ventilation were randomly assigned to either the supine position or daily prone position sessions lasting at least 16 h. Prone position ventilation was associated with reduced 28 day mortality compared with supine ventilation (32\u00b78% vs 16\u00b70%, p<0\u00b7001; HR 0\u00b744, 95% CI 0\u00b729\u20130\u00b767).

At present, the evidence base for these interventions is sparse, consisting of case series, observational cohort studies, and one randomised controlled trial. In the CESAR study,114 rather than directly assessing ECMO in refractory hypoxaemia, investigators compared management at a referring centre with management at a tertiary centre capable of providing ECMO in 180 patients. The cohort managed at the ECMO centre had a higher rate of survival without disability at 6 months than did those managed at referring centres (63% vs 47%; RR 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b705\u20130\u00b797; p=0\u00b703), although only 75% of the group received ECMO. Two observational studies, one from Australia and New Zealand115 and one from the UK,116 also showed high rates of survival with ECMO in patients with influenza A (H1N1) with refractory hypoxaemia on maximum ventilatory support. However, ECMO is a scarce and expensive resource that is often available only at specialist centres (figure 4) and associated with well recognised complications, including bleeding, vascular damage, and risks from interhospital transfer. Despite widespread and growing use worldwide, at present there is an absence of level one evidence for its efficacy.

However, in the large randomised controlled ALBIOS trial,135 in which investigators examined a strategy of albumin administration to maintain plasma albumin concentrations higher than 30 g/L in patients with sepsis and septic shock, beneficial effects on respiratory sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were not associated with higher plasma albumin concentrations, although a specified subgroup analysis was not done for this outcome.

A subsequent small phase 2 study of fish oils in 90 patients again failed to demonstrate benefit in this population.140 A meta-analysis145 supported a lack of efficacy associated with fish oil supplementation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and a consensus paper summarising current nutritional evidence did not support the administration of pharmaconutrients.146\n",

There are many reasons for this failure, but arguably the most important is the limitation of the current definitions of acute respiratory distress syndrome in terms of the identification of patients expressing the biological target under investigation. In approximately half of patients who meet diagnostic criteria and subsequently undergo post-mortem examination, the pathognomonic finding of diffuse alveolar damage is not present.6, 7, 8, 9, 13 These patients could have a mixture of coexisting conditions. In most positive trials so far, the improved outcome was a result of less injurious mechanical ventilation in the intervention group. All mechanically ventilated patients are at risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, and thus the limitation of recruiting a heterogeneous cohort based on the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome is minimised. However, when a therapy aimed at a specific biological target is investigated, such heterogeneity assumes greater importance and reduces the ability to detect any possible effect.",
