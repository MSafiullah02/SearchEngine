            "text": "Enolase was originally characterized as an enzyme involved in glycolytic metabolism catalyzing the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate into phosphoenolpyruvate. In mammals, there are three isoforms of enolase, called \u03b1-ENO1, \u03b2-ENO3 and \u03b3-ENO2 (Redlitz et al., 1995). The \u03b1-enolase is a major form of enolase present in the early stages of embryonic development; it is expressed ubiquitously in various types of tissue, whereas \u03b3-ENO2 and \u03b2-ENO3 are exclusively found in neuron and muscle cells (Antikainen et al., 2007, Chang et al., 2006). By using an alternative translation start codon, ENO1 can be translated into c-myc promoter binding protein 1 (MBP-1), which is preferentially localized in cell nuclei (Feo et al., 2000). Both ENO1 and MBP-1 proteins are known to be negative regulators for c-myc expression.",

            "text": "Recently, it was reported that \u03b1-enolase is a multifunctional protein which exhibits enzymatic, structural, and receptor functions (Chang et al., 2006, Lee et al., 2003). In addition to its glycolytic function, \u03b1-enolase has been found to play an important role in several biological and pathophysiological processes (Sirover, 1996, Sirover, 1999). In particular, several studies have found \u03b1-enolase to play important roles in tumorigenesis. For example, Redlitz et al. (1995) found \u03b1-enolase on the cell surface, functioning as one of the plasminogen receptors which may play a role in tumor invasion. Up-regulation of \u03b1-enolase has also been reported in several highly tumorigenic or metastatic cell lines (Chang et al., 2006, Ito et al., 2007, Peebles et al., 2003, Wu et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2000). \u03b1-Enolase over-expression has been correlated with tumorigenicity in several types of cancer, which suggests its pathophysiologic role in cancer formation (Altenberg and Greulich, 2004). Furthermore, an autoantigen of \u03b1-enolase was identified in non-small cell lung cancer and its over-expression was highly correlated with poor survival outcomes (Chang et al., 2006). In addition to its roles in cancer, \u03b1-enolase has been implicated in numerous diseases, including autoimmune disorders, ischaemia and bacterial infection (Antikainen et al., 2007, Bogdanos et al., 2004, Gitlits et al., 2001, Jiang et al., 1997, Kinloch et al., 2005, Saulot et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Generation of monoclonal antibodies with high specificity to various target antigens through traditional hybridoma technology is an expensive and tedious process (Groves and Morris, 2000). In recent years, a phage display system which is more cost and time effective involving the in vitro cloning of antibody heavy and light genes, has been extensively used to identify and isolate monoclonal antibodies from recombinant antibody repertories (Barbas et al., 1991, Winter et al., 1994). Smaller recombinant engineered antibody fragments, e.g. antigen-binding fragment (Fab) or single-chain variable fragment (scFv), are now emerging as new applications in diagnosis and therapy for the biotechnology market. ScFv molecules in which the VH and VL domains are joined with a flexible polypeptide linker usually retain the specific, monovalent antigen-binding affinity of the parent IgG, while showing improved pharmacokinetics for tissue penetration (Holliger and Hudson, 2005). Among all the animals suitable for antigen immunization, domestic chicken is the most feasible and available host for scFv antibody library construction to screen efficient binders against various pathogen infections for diagnostic applications (Fehrsen et al., 2005, Finlay et al., 2006, Park et al., 2005). From the aforementioned studies, \u03b1-enolase might serve as a potential target for diagnostic or therapeutic application clinically. Accordingly, in the present study, we generated and characterized the anti-\u03b1-enolase polyclonal IgY antibodies in chicken and monoclonal scFv antibodies by a phage display system using ELISA, Western blotting, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining.",

The PE089 cell line was originally obtained from effusion tumor cells of a 36-year-old patient with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, which was kindly provided by Dr. Neng-Yao Shih from National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan, Taiwan. The resultant PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEX-KG vector at EcoRI and NcoI sites and transformed into the E. coli BL-21 (DE3) strain for expression.

Individual clones were grown in 5 ml LB medium containing ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml) at 37\u00b0C overnight. The bacterial culture was diluted 10-fold in the same LB medium and further grown until the OD600 reached between 0.6 and 1.0. To induce GST-fused or His-fused \u03b1-enolase protein expression, isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM in the culture. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 2 ml of 1\u00d7 PBS containing 1% Triton x-100 and lysed by three cycles of freezing (\u221270 \u00b0C) and thawing (37 \u00b0C).

Two hundred milligrams of spleen were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and placed in 2 ml Trizol solution for RNA extraction using the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, USA). Ten micrograms of total RNA was reversely transcribed into the first-strand cDNA using a SuperScript RT kit (Invitrogen, USA). After amplification using chicken-specific primers (Andris-Widhopf et al., 2000), PCR products of heavy and light chain variable (VH and VL) regions were subjected to a second round of PCR with a short- or long-linker (Andris-Widhopf et al., 2000) to form full-length scFv fragments, which were further digested with SfiI and cloned into the pComb3X vector. Recombinant DNAs were transformed into E. coli XL-1 blue strain by electroporation. Recombinant phage production was initiated by the addition of VCS-M13 helper phage, precipitated with 4% polyethylglycol 8000 and 3% NaCl (w/v), and finally re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Then, 1011 plaque-forming units (pfu) of recombinant phages from the scFv antibody library were added to wells pre-coated with \u03b1-enolase protein (0.5 \u03bcg/well), and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. After removing unbound phages, bound phages were eluted with 0.1 M HCl/glycine (pH 2.2)/0.1% BSA, neutralized with 2 M Tris base buffer and used to infect the XL-1 blue strain. The amplified phages were precipitated and recovered as described above for the next round of selection. The panning procedure was repeated three or four times. A panel of clones were randomly selected and grown from the final panning process. After 0.5 mM IPTG induction for 6 h, bacterial cells were collected and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing and/or sonication. The supernatants were analyzed for their scFv antibody expression and binding reactivity to \u03b1-enolase using Western blotting and ELISA. ScFv antibodies expressed in TOP 10F\u2032 E. coli (Invitrogen, a nonsuppressor strain) and purified using Ni2+-charged sepharose as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, UK) were also prepared in flow cytometric and immunofluoresence analyses.",

The cell morphology and distribution under light microscopy are included in the most left panel for comparison. Taken together, the results provided further evidence to show that phage display technology might be a better alternative over hybridoma protocol for the cloning and generation of scFv antibodies against specific antigens.",

The recombinant \u03b1-enolase proteins were successfully expressed in E. coli and purified to a great extent of homogeneity as shown in Fig. 1. A specific humoral response in immunized chickens was steadily observed after a 2nd booster injection. The polyclonal IgY antibodies from the 4th immunization showed a strong reactivity to \u03b1-enolase antigen using a 1:16,000 dilution. Moreover, the high titer of anti-\u03b1-enolase IgY antibodies was continuously detected 4 months after final immunization (data not shown). Taken together, our data indicated that \u03b1-enolase protein is highly immunogenic in experimental chicken, and this system has been applied to elicit polyclonal IgY antibodies with high specificity against numerous genetically distinctive antigens (Chalghoumi et al., 2008, Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002, Shin et al., 2002).",

As is often encountered in protein expression studies, the expressed levels and stability in our characterized scFv clones containing evolutionarily close immunoglobulin genes were also unpredictable and various (Graves et al., 2008, Jana and Deb, 2005). As shown in Fig. 4, EnL1, EnL3 and EnL9 scFv antibodies were barely detected as determined on Western blots as compared to EnL5, EnL6 and EnL7 clones. Indeed, the amount of expressed scFv antibodies of EnL5, EnL6 and EnL7 was clearly visualized on Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE (data not shown). These 3 clones exhibited identical protein expression patterns, suggesting they might be derived from one parental clone. This speculation was further supported by subsequent sequence analysis on the heavy and light chain variable genes of these clones. We did not detect any scFv antibodies expressed in clone EnL8 or EnL10 under identical conditions. Combined with the fact that all the immunoglobulin genes are highly conserved as mentioned earlier, our data indicate that the levels of their expression as scFv molecules in E. coli cells vary tremendously from clone to clone.",

We have constructed several immune antibody libraries from the spleen of chicken immunized with \u03b1-enolase by this novel technology. Of these antibody libraries, two, one constructed with a short-linker (6 \u00d7 104\n clones) and the other with a long-linker (3.5 \u00d7 105\n clones), were panned against recombinant human \u03b1-enolase. Several specific scFv antibodies with high binding activity, as represented by clones EnL2 and EnL5, were obtained from the long-linker containing library. On the contrast, the scFv antibodies characterized in the short-linker containing library are of low affinity and specificity. Our pilot studies demonstrated that the specific anti-\u03b1-enolase scFv antibody clones could not be readily detected in the original library constructed with a short-linker in a plaque lift assay (data not shown), suggesting the heavy and light variable genes specific for \u03b1-enolase might not be amplified, cloned, expressed or displayed on the surface of M13 viral particles. However, the reasons for such results are not exactly known.",

Sequence analysis data indicated all the clones contained heavy and light chain variable genes derived from the chicken germline in which 3 clones (EnL5, EnL6 and EnL7) use the same heavy and light genes for their scFv antibody expression Together with the finding that the ratio of recombinant clones with full-length of scFv gene inserts increased from 67% to 100% during the panning cycles, the data supported very strongly that mono-specific anti-\u03b1-enolase with high affinity could be steadily generated using phage display antibody technology. Notably, high mutation rates ranging from 14.3% to 100% were found in CDR regions of both VL and VH genes; in particular the entire CDR3 region of VH genes of chicken germline was substituted by amino acids with various length and sequences in all the characterized clones (Fig. 5). It was previously reported that somatic hypermutations to increase antibody affinity occurred more frequently in the CDR than FR regions of the rearranged V genes (Gearhart and Bogenhagen, 1983). Thus, all EnL clones in the study accumulated more mutations in their CDR regions as a result of affinity selection of B cells.",
