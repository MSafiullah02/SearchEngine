Whole blood donations were separated into red cells, platelets, and plasma, while virus testing usually consisted of serological assays for either viral antigens or antibodies in the donor. The viral safety of blood, already high in the more affluent parts of the world, potentially took a quantum leap with the development of rapid, automatable genome amplification assays on the one hand, and pathogen inactivation techniques on the other. Meantime, there was a search to find a way of avoiding human blood transfusion altogether, by developing alternative ways of transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. This chapter outlines the rapid change in these fields in the last two decades, and attempts to set these into the context of policy making for national blood supplies.",

Innovation in this area was originally driven by military requirements for a long shelf life battlefield solution that would need neither refrigeration nor matching with the recipient. The publicity surrounding transfusion-transmitted infections since the 1980s (HIV, hepatitis B and C, West Nile virus [WNV] , and now prions) provided a new impetus to these developments. Now many countries face chronic blood shortages. In developed countries, this is primarily because of an imbalance between the blood requirements of an aging population and a diminishing donor base, whereas in the developing world, lack of infrastructure to collect, test, and store blood safely is a major issue. So the need for alternatives to human blood remains.",

Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that a \"one size fits all\" solution will not work, and that the specification of a product for transfusion dependent patients could differ from what is needed for acute hemorrhage.

Peripheral vasoconstriction is mediated by autonomic reflexes. At less than 50% blood loss, fluid shifts into circulation to maintain blood volume, so hematocrit and viscosity fall. This reduces the shear forces exerted on the endothelium, resulting in a reduction of production and release of natural vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin. Peripheral resistance therefore rises further, and tissue blood flow slows even more, until a point is reached when oxygen supply is insufficient for tissue demands. Then anaerobic respiration takes over, leading to buildup of CO 2 and lactic acid. Once established, this state of metabolic acidosis is difficult to treat.",

In the absence of 2,3 DPG, the oxygen dissociation curve of free hemoglobin is left shifted when compared to hemoglobin in red cells. Early investigators considered this as a potentially useful characteristic, but this increase in oxygen affinity means that oxygen does not readily off-load from the carrier to the tissues. Strategies taken to reverse this shift include pyridoxylation, site-directed mutagenesis, polymerization, and internal crosslinking, all discussed later. A completely different approach is to use bovine hemoglobin, which, although having 90% sequence homology with human hemoglobin, responds allosterically to chloride ion rather than to 2,3 DPG. Therefore, at physiological chloride concentrations, its oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve resembles that of human hemoglobin within red cells. 3.

This product can transport oxygen to the tissues effectively, and even in low doses can raise arterial pressure and lower cardiac index. It was reported to be life saving in a case of severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and has been licensed in South Africa for orthopedic surgery. Currently, a trial is proposed in which Hemopure is used in cardiac surgery to improve tissue oxygenation by diffusion through an atheromatous obstruction in coronary arteries.

In addition, to prevent \u03b1 \u03b2-dimerization and renal toxicity, and to increase the half-life, the product was made using one duplicated, tandemly fused \u03b1-globin gene, resulting in end-to-end fusion of the two \u03b1globin-subunits.

However, a human hemoglobin solution designated pyridoxal hemoglobin polyoxyethylene developed by Apex Bioscience is in phase IIc trial in shock. Encapsulation To prevent the renal toxicity and short halflife associated with free hemoglobin, attempts have been made to enclose hemoglobin in liposomes consisting of synthetic lipids in various combinations. Phosphotidylcholine has been used to produce bilamellar spheres loaded with a hemoglobin solution, whereas the addition of cholesterol increases elasticity and halflife. In theory, the oxygen affinity could be modulated by the inclusion of 2,3 DPG, whereas methemoglobin reductase could be added to prevent oxidation. However, there are technical difficulties in controlling the size of the liposomes, and it is not yet clear what effects the clearance of large amounts of phosphotidylcholine would have on the reticuloendothelial system.

This property of free hemoglobin contributes to the hypertensive properties of some solutions. 2. The realization that diffusion of cell-free oxygenated hemoglobin can be harmful, as it leads to constriction of precapillary arterioles and thus reduces tissue perfusion. Significant amounts of oxygen leave the circulation at the precapillary arteriolar stage. These vessels are rich in nerve endings, and appear to be extremely sensitive to oxygen. The so-called facilitated diffusion of oxygen that is bound to the free hemoglobin can be limited by increasing both the diameter of the hemoglobin molecule itself and the viscosity of the solution. Modified hemoglobin molecules of different radii have varying vasoactive properties, even though their interaction with NO is the same. Widespread prearteriolar vasoconstriction in the presence of a normal blood volume leads to hypertension; conversely vasoconstriction with an inadequate blood volume results in shock, volume depletion and ultimately collapse of the nonmuscular capillary walls, which rely on vascular pressure to keep them open. To overcome this undesirable side effect, oxygen availability from the hemoglobin substitute should be less than that from natural red cells. Oxygen availability to the precapillary arterioles can be limited by increasing the oxygen affinity of the molecule and decreasing its concentration in the solution. 3. Production of vasodilators stimulated by shear forces on the endothelium can be maintained by having a solution of fairly high viscosity. At rest, therefore (though not during exercise), the maintenance of microvascular blood flow, vascular volume and acid-base balance are more important than oxygen carrying capacity. These observations change the r r theoretical requirements of an oxygen carrier (Table 91-3) .

This inherent lack of sensitivity was overcome in different ways: one was extreme sensitivity of assays with the attached toll on specificity, the other was concentration of targets by various methods, the most popular being ultracentrifugation. When NAT targeted viruses such as HCV or HIV that replicate very rapidly to viral load above 10 5 copies/mL, pooling did not substantially affect screening efficacy, although most national blood transfusion organizations progressively reduced the number of samples per pool from 96 to 48, 24, and 16. The lower viral load observed with HBV and WNV during the infectious window period led blood services to reduce further pool size to 8 or 10 samples. Ultimately, individual donation NAT already implemented by some blood organizations will likely become the rule, particularly with the relative decrease in costs introduced by multiplexing.",

However, before implementation, several criteria need to be met. The emerging virus should be pathogenic, transmissible by transfusion, in relatively low prevalence, and infectious/persistent for a long enough period of time. The recent severe acute respiratory system, SARS, infection epidemic falls into the first category; although no evidence of transfusion transmission has been provided. The second category includes GB virus-C, TT virus, and SEN virus. The first virus is of low prevalence but no evidence of pathogenicity has been found, whereas the other two, which are in the same family of human circoviridae, are ubiquitous and with no identified pathogenicity. most promising generation of such compounds targets nucleic acids directly, which are altered and made unable to replicate. In addition to having the potential to inactivate viral and bacterial nucleic acids, compounds such as Psoralens (S59), Inactine, and Riboflavin can inactivate parasites and leucocytes, particularly lymphocytes responsible for transfusion-associated graft-vs-host disease, a universally fatal complication. These follow other chemicals such as methylene blue or solvent detergent-based methods already in use. Because solvent/detergent is effective by disrupting viral (and possibly bacterial) membranes, the spectrum of activity is limited to enveloped viruses. Among the compounds listed in Table 91 -5, Solvent detergent and methylene blue can only be used in fresh frozen plasma as it disrupts cell membranes. Clinical use of Amotosalen has been started in some European countries, following CE marking. Published randomized trial results indicate efficacy of the system, and although there is a systematic reduction of platelet yield compared to standard products, this difference did not seem to affect clinical efficacy in preventing bleeding. In vitro and in animals, no evidence of oncogenic or other toxicities have been found in shortand long-term studies. However, clinical trials of two different pathogen reduction systems for red cells (S303 and Inactine) have both been suspended following development of red cell alloantibodies.

Among the many methods developed to detect bacterial contamination, the most effective practiced method is culture, with detection either by accumulation of CO 2 or consumption of O 2 . These methods are very sensitive, but require a period of natural bacterial growth to amplify the number of bacteria to a detectable level. This procedure takes time (at least 24 h), a major handicap for a product whose shelf life is only 5 d. Molecular methods including an amplification step can overcome this drawback but the diversity of bacterial genome makes it difficult to cover a large spectrum of organisms. Methods targeting the 16S ribosomal (r)RNA have been proposed, whereas others use a universal bacterial rRNA probe. To date, despite a sensitivity of 6-500 organisms/100 \u03bcL, these methods do not cover a sufficiently large spectrum of bacteria and are considered expensive and labor intensive. Considerable development is needed before molecular methods can be considered as suitable replacement for methods involving culture.",

Rules of donor exclusion according to place of origin or traveling have been implemented, but the yield is poor and the number of undeserved donor deferrals high. Various methods have been proposed to distinguish between donors presenting with and without a real risk of transmission. In the case of malaria, antibody detection identifies individuals who have been infected in the past but are not necessarily infectious, whereas antigen detection or thick blood smear are not sufficiently sensitive and, for the latter, discouragingly labor intensive. Genomic amplification methods have therefore been developed using nested PCR or quantitative PCR to detect one parasite per 100 \u03bcL of whole blood.
