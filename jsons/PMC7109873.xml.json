However, the duration of shedding from the 2 sites seems to be different: analysis based on the diagnostic yield of specimens taken at different times [9] has shown that virus shedding from the gastrointestinal tract persists longer than does that from the respiratory tract.

The functions of these ORFs remain unknown. An earlier report on the SARS-CoV genome [13] predicted that ORFs 9, 10, and 11 would code for proteins comprising 44, 39, and 84 aa, respectively. That report also noted that ORF 9 was comparable to a putative sterol-C5 desaturase and a Clostridium perfringens protein but that ORF 10 was not comparable to any known proteins listed in public databases. The structure predicted for ORFs 9 and 10 was a single transmembrane helix, and that for ORF 11 was a soluble protein; the latter showed a slight match to the human coronavirus S glycoprotein precursor [13]. More recently, Li et al. [14] have suggested that ORF 10 may play a role by impairing the oxidoreductase system in the mitochondria of SARS-CoV\u2013infected host cells, and those authors therefore have hypothesized that the clinical effects of SARS-CoV infection in humans may be due to a direct cytopathic effect of the virus, rather than to virus-induced immunopathological damage. A study of 33 complete SARS-CoV genomes [15] found that ORF 10 had the highest point-mutation rate, a rate that was higher than that in parts of the replicase, S, and N genes; because this high mutation rate has also been reported for a similar region (ORF 10\u2032) in the SL-CoVs recently isolated from 3 species of horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) [4], ORF 10 seems to be present in human and other mammalian SARS-CoV and SL-CoV species, although its function remains unknown. In both the human and civet-cat host, it is unclear whether the reported deletions in the various ORFs of the SARS-CoV genome have any significant clinical consequence; however, at least 1 of them, the 29-nt deletion, was considered to be a marker of a human-host origin when it was found in SARS-CoV isolated from a pig [16]. Therefore, at present, the region covered by ORFs 10 and 11 would seem to be useful as a genetic marker of a possible animal origin of SARS-CoV, rather than as a therapeutic or vaccine target\u2014in contrast to its structural counterparts, such as the S gene (ORF 2) [17]",
