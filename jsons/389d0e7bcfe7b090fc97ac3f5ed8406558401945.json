The sample is then rapidly chilled on ice, for 1 min. The sample is then spun down, and 4 l 5X first-strand buffer, 1 l 10 mM dNTP, and 1 l 100 mM DTT are added and mixed gently by pipetting up and down. The samples are then incubated for 1 min at 55 \u2022 C, and 1 l RNaseOUT (40 U/l) and 2 l Superscript III (200 U/l) are added to each sample, and the samples are rapidly put back into the thermocycler used for RT. The RT is performed at 55 \u2022 C, for 80 min, followed by enzyme inactivation at 70 \u2022 C and cooling at 4 \u2022 C thereafter (see Note 7). 2. The samples from reverse transcription are centrifuged for 20 sec at 1538 \u00d7 g to collect all droplets, and incubated at 37 \u2022 C in a thermocycler. A 1-l RNase mix is then added to each sample (see Note 8) and mixed gently by pipetting up and down, and the samples are put back into the thermocycler for further incubation for 30 min at 37 \u2022 C. When the incubation is finished, the samples are spun down and cooled. 3. The newly synthesized cDNA is purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the following modifications: all mixing steps are performed gently, and the sample is eluted in 30 l RNase/DNase-free water prewarmed at 65 \u2022 C. The cDNA amount is measured spectrophotometrically on a NanoDrop. 4. Cytosine residues are added to the 3'-ends of purified cDNA, in order to make a homopolymeric (C) tail to serve as a handle for semispecific amplification with a specially designed anchor primer. The tailing is performed as follows: 10 l of the purified cDNA is added to 6.5 l RNase/DNase-free water, 5 l 5X tailing buffer, and 2.5 l 2 mM dCTP. In order to avoid secondary structure in the cDNA that might impair the tailing, a short denaturation step is performed at 94 \u2022 C for 3 min. The sample is then immediately chilled on ice and spun down. One l TdT (15 U/l) is then added, and the tailing reaction is performed at 37 \u2022 C for 10 min, followed by an enzyme inactivation step at 65 \u2022 C for 10 min. The sample is then spun down and cooled on ice. 5. The 5 -RACE PCR is performed as follows (see Note 9): 5 l tailed sample is added to 45 l PCR mix consisting of 34.5 l RNase/DNase-free water, 5 l 10X BD Advantage 2 PCR buffer, 1 l dNTP (10 mM), 1 l coronavirus-specific reverse primer (25 M), 2.5 l abridged anchor primer (10 M), and 1 l BD Advantage polymerase mix.

The cycling is followed by a step at 68 \u2022 C for 7 min and cooling to 4 \u2022 C thereafter. 6. Prior to sequencing reaction, the PCR product, appearing as a weak smear on a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, is purified directly using the QIAquick PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a final elution volume of 30 l (see Note 11). Cycle sequencing is performed using BigDye Terminator version 3.1, for long PCR product sequencing, with the following reagents: 4 l BigDye Terminator mix, 1.3 l coronavirus-specific reverse primer 2 (2.5 M), and 4.7 l PCR product.

            "text": "1. In addition to coronaviruses, this procedure has been successfully applied to amplify and sequence novel astrovirus and picornavirus genomes, and potentially all polyadenylated viral genomes harboring s2m can be identified and characterized with this procedure. However, when used on biological samples that do not contain s2m-harboring viruses, nonspecific amplification of host cell ribosomal RNA is obtained on some occasions. 2. We have generally used 1 l anchored oligo(dT) 18 (25 M) in the RT, but 1 l Invitrogens anchored oligo(dT) 20 (2.5 g/l, corresponding to ca. 350 M), or Invitrogens standard oligo(dT) 20 (50 M), has also been used successfully as a reverse primer. 3. The obtained PCR products often give a smear on visualization on agarose gel, owing to serial mispriming of the anchored oligo(dT) primer on the 3 poly(A) tail, leading to long-range accumulation of As in the PCR products that can be observed upon sequencing. However, if amplification is successful, all PCR products, regardless of the number of terminal As, have the same start at s2m, as the s2m-core primer is highly specific, and the PCR product smear can be sequenced using s2m-core or s2m-coreseq primer. 4. As several of the viruses harboring s2m do terminate the genome with GC(A)n, AV12 (2.5 M) can often be used for sequencing the opposite strand. If low signal intensity is obtained for the sequences, the following modifications can be made in the cycle sequencing program: lowering the annealing temperature to 50 \u2022 C and/or adding 5-10 cycles in the cycle sequencing reaction. 5. Once a specific reverse primer can be designed as described in Section 3.2, an alternative strategy to 5 -RACE/primer walking is to amplify directly a long PCR product using upstream primers in conserved family-specific motifs, e.g., in the polymerase gene. This will be achieved more easily with viruses that have small genomes, such as astrovirus and picornavirus, especially when the polymerase is encoded toward the 3 -end of the genome, rather than with coronaviruses that have a large genome. In our laboratory, we were able to get sequence information by using the sense 2Bm primer designed by Stephensen et al. in 1999 (7) toward the coronavirus specific primer at the 3 -end of the coronavirus genome. However, the PCR product yield was low, and only short sequence stretches could be obtained in this way. 6. The RT in the 5 -RACE procedure is laborious, as no mix containing all the reagents is prepared in advance, but, rather, primer and enzymes are added individually to each sample. In addition, the 5 -RACE procedure described in the Invitrogen handbook suggests that the RNase treatment of the sample be performed on freshly synthesized cDNA, that has not been frozen. This is why the initial RT step described in Section 3.1, performed in order to check novel coronavirus genomes for the presence of s2m, makes use of a simpler RT protocol. 7. An increased amount of the Superscript III reverse transcriptase (400 U per reaction instead of the normally 200 U) is used for long-range cDNA synthesis in the 5 -RACE strategy. In addition, this enzyme allows the reaction to be performed at a temperature as high as 55 \u2022 C, which minimizes secondary structures in RNA and is RNase H negative, which increases the yield of full-length cDNAs. 8. It is important to degrade the template RNA from the newly synthesized cDNA, to avoid hybrid renaturation prior to the tailing step. The RNase mix consists of both RNase H to hydrolyze RNA bound to cDNA, and RNase T1 to hydrolyze free RNA molecules. 9. The 5 -RACE PCR is semispecific, using an anchor primer as sense primer, which amplifies the poly(C)-tailed template, and a newly designed coronavirusspecific reverse primer. Even if care has been taken throughout the whole procedure to avoid synthesis of short cDNAs from template RNA, there might be some shorter cDNA molecules that will be more easily amplified in PCRs. It is therefore important to use a PCR enzyme with a proofreading activity, in order to get PCR products from the longer cDNA molecules as well. 10. The long elongation step is chosen to allow amplification of longer cDNAs. 11. As cDNA molecules of different lengths are generated during RT, the 5 -RACE PCR products will be of different lengths, so the 5 -RACE abridged anchor primer cannot be used in cycle sequencing. As all the 5 -RACE PCR products have aligned 3 -ends, the coronavirus-specific 5 -RACE reverse PCR primer or, preferably for increased specificity, a primer slightly upstream of this PCR primer is used in cycle sequencing. 12. Using this procedure, one should obtain at least 500 nucleotides, which would allow the design of new primers both in sense direction for sequence verification and reverse direction for acquisition of new sequence data toward the 5 -end of the genome in a primer walking strategy. The new primers can be used directly in step 5 of the 5 -RACE procedure, if all the steps have been optimized for longrange cDNA synthesis. However, usually no more than 2000-3000 nucleotides are efficiently sequenced from the initial 5 -RACE-RT, and the whole 5 -RACE procedure has to be repeated with a primer for cDNA synthesis as upstream as possible.",
