Thus, empirical antibiotics are frequently necessary. The Australian and New Zealand guidelines for bronchiectasis recommend amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate as the first-line empirical oral antibiotic therapy for non-severe exacerbations in children.11 European guidelines do not name the antibiotics but refer to a paper that recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate.10, 12 Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate is active against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, the three bacterial pathogens detected most often in high densities in the lower airways of children with bronchiectasis.13 However, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate requires multiple dosing per day and can cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Oral azithromycin is attractive as an alternative first-line therapy because of its long half-life, which means it can be taken less frequently, and is well-tolerated by children. In disadvantaged communities, twice-daily dosing of antibiotics such as amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate is not always feasible, and might result in children with exacerbations receiving suboptimal treatment, risking continuing symptoms and antibiotic resistance. Three randomised controlled trials14 did not show that azithromycin was superior to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate for treating paediatric community-acquired pneumonia. However, azithromycin is still used in some settings as first-line treatment of acute exacerbations in children with underlying bronchiectasis.15\n",

We repeated these searches on Jan 8, 2018. We used the terms \u201cbronchiectasis\u201d and \u201ccontrolled trials\u201d. We then searched using keywords \u201cantibiotics\u201d, \u201cbronchiectasis\u201d, and \u201cexacerbation\u201d in the same databases. Our searches were restricted to reports in English. We found six randomised controlled trials of antibiotic treatment of exacerbations in adults, of which only one was placebo-controlled. The remaining five compared two different antibiotics, none of which were macrolides, and three were open-label. All involved small numbers of patients (range 18\u201343) and none was in children. During the study, studies on the long-term use of macrolides in adults and children with bronchiectasis were published, but there are still no strong data on antibiotics in acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children.\nAdded value of this study\nTo our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial comparing amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate with azithromycin for treating exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis. It shows that, within a 20% margin, azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate for resolving symptoms at 21 days when treating acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis, but takes significantly longer to resolve.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nAlthough azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin-clavulanate for treating non-severe acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children, the exacerbation might take significantly longer to resolve, and the risk of inducing macrolide resistance should be considered. Although azithromycin might be used cautiously for some patients, such as those with penicillin hypersensitivity or for whom less frequent dosing might improve adherence, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate remains the first choice empirical antibiotic.\n",

The size of the non-inferiority margin was chosen by the respiratory physicians in the study and determined by what, in their view, was a clinically acceptable loss of efficacy compensated for by azithromycin's dosing profile and potential for increased treatment adherence from daily supervised use in remote and rural settings. The resolution percentage was informed by a pilot study of 15 children treated with oral amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate for a non-severe exacerbation in which 12 (80%) children had their symptoms resolved by day 21. To achieve 90% power with a one-sided \u03b1 of 0\u00b7025, we would require a sample size of 170 children (85 per arm). Because the primary outcome was to be captured in all randomly assigned participants, we did not account for attrition in the sample size calculations. We defined azithromycin to be non-inferior to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the risk difference in proportions of children whose exacerbation resolved was greater than \u221220\u00b70%.",

            "text": "Notwithstanding the novelty of our study, it has several limitations. There were unequal numbers of patients in the two treatment groups, probably as a result of block randomisation and site-specific stratification based on age and cause, leading to 16 concurrent randomisation lists. Nevertheless, the groups were evenly matched. Second, the optimum antibiotic doses for treating bronchiectasis exacerbations are unknown. The commonly used dose for the 7:1 formulation of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate available in Australia and New Zealand of 45 mg/kg per day is efficacious for treating children with protracted bacterial bronchitis;29 hence, the pragmatic dosing chosen for the study. However, 80 mg/kg per day of amoxicillin is recommended for treating childhood pneumonia in settings of antibiotic resistance.30 Similarly, without studies comparing different doses of azithromycin to treat lower respiratory tract infections or bronchiectasis exacerbations, we used the commonly recommended 5 mg/kg per day regimen, which corresponded with total weekly dosing of 30\u201335 mg/kg used successfully in a trial17 of long-term azithromycin to reduce exacerbation frequency in children with bronchiectasis. Third, the time to next exacerbation was based on parental recall of symptoms. Although some exacerbations might not have been recorded, there is no reason to believe that this would have been unevenly distributed between treatment groups. Fourth, only children not requiring hospital admission for an exacerbation were randomly assigned, which could explain such favourable resolution rates (77%). However, enrolling children deemed unwell enough to need intravenous antibiotics to an oral antibiotic trial is ethically unacceptable. Last, because most children are unable to expectorate, deep nasal swabs were collected as described previously.17 Although such specimens reflect poorly the lower airway microbiology, knowing nasopharyngeal carriage is more important from a community perspective because this is the principal reservoir for spreading antibiotic-resistant bacteria.25\n",

The compromise when using azithromycin instead of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate is that the exacerbation may last as much as 4 days longer, and the potential risks of inducing macrolide resistance should also be considered. Azithromycin should therefore be regarded only as an alternative treatment for bronchiectasis exacerbations in children with penicillin hypersensitivity or if there is a high-risk of poor adherence with multiple daily dosing and directly observed therapy is possible. Further randomised controlled trials in other populations of patients with bronchiectasis are needed to validate the results of the present study. Until these data are available, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate remains the empirical first-line therapy of choice for treating non-severe exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children.",
