The observations that transmission is increased in women who were symptomatic or who had more advanced AIDS27 and that zidovudine therapy given during pregnancy reduces perinatal transmission3 suggest that viral burden is an important factor in vertical transmission; however, the effects of maternal nutritional status, micronutrient deficiency, or acute infection on viral replication are difficult to evaluate. In addition, most HIV-infected women in Africa, Asia, and South America breast-feed their infants. This additional means by which infants can possibly become infected complicates assessment of factors contributing to transmission. In Africa, the percentage of postnatal transmission is approximately 50%.36 Nevertheless, the morbidity and mortality caused by formula feeding in countries where potable water is a premium and safe infant formula is not readily available seem to be greater than the risk of acquiring HIV-1 from breast milk. The current recommendation is for the HIV-exposed infant to have formula feeding if and only if safe formula exists in the community. For most of the developing world, this is not a reality.",

In the gastrointestinal tract, HIV-infected lymphocytes could migrate from the lymphoid aggregates through the mesenteric nodes, the thoracic duct, and into the circulation. Following selection by receptors on high endothelial venules, these infected cells then migrate home to the lamina propria, whereby in situ hybridization isolated HIV-infected cells can be identified (Fig 1)\n. Most evidence supports the hypothesis that deterioration of mucosal immune function results in bacterial overgrowth; increased production of bacterial products, such as endotoxin; activation of mucosal lymphocytes with increased cytokine production; and probable interaction between immunoregulatory elements and epithelial cell function (Fig. 2)\n. Although the reasons for early development of lactose intolerance and malabsorption are not known, substances involved in immune regulation also may interact with intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in dysfunction. HIV also may have a role in the genesis of intestinal dysfunction, but data are not available. Clearly, enteric infections begin to occur at the time when immune function is deteriorating (Fig.3)\n. The contribution of chronic intestinal infection to immune dysfunction, malabsorption, and malnutrition suggests that all of these factors are interrelated (Fig.4).\n",

In studies from Africa, if an HIV-infected mother is symptomatic or dies, her HIV-infected infant is at increased risk for chronic diarrhea partially because of the resulting reliance on formula.31 Chronic diarrhea in the HIV-infected child is an important prognostic variable for predicting malnutrition and death. Because of the availability of safe formula in North America and Europe, the relationship between maternal health and infant survival is not as obvious. Nevertheless, a chronically ill mother has an obvious negative impact on infant growth and development, particularly if no additional support is available, such as respite and day care programs designed to enrich infants' psychosocial development and nutritional status.",

When oral lesions are present, coexistent esophagitis should be suspected. In contrast, if the mouth is free of lesions, esophagitis cannot be ruled out. Candida and cytomegalovirus are the most common infectious agents causing esophagitis. Dysphagia and odynophagia in HIV-infected children are more commonly associated with Candida than with cytomegalovirus. Children who are taking H2 antagonists seem to be at increased risk for developing Candida esophagitis. Medications, such as zidovudine, have been reported to cause esophageal ulceration if, when swallowed, they do not reach the stomach.6 Treatment for specific causes of oral or esophageal lesions is summarized in Table 3\n",

In Figure 4, the interrelationship between malabsorption, malnutrition, immune deficiency, and enteric infection is depicted. Enteric infection results in intestinal injury and malabsorption, which, if not compensated by additional nutrient support, results in nutritional deficiency. The development of malnutrition causes immune deficiency, which is characterized by a defect in T-cell function that is similar to the defect caused by HIV disease. Defective T-cell function results in increased susceptibility to enteric infection, and the circle is completed. HIV can interact at any of the stages of this cycle. In theory, intestinal absorption can be altered by modifying enterocyte function through immune modulators. By increasing apoptosis, HIV could cause premature senescence of enterocytes and decrease brushborder expression of disaccharidases and peptidases. Some of these same agents, such as the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, are upregulated by HIV infection, affect intermediate metabolism, and cause malnutrition by increasing nutrient requirements. The effects of HIV on the immune system are well known and result in immunocompromise and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infection. Similar immunoregulatory abnormalities probably occur in the mucosal immune system, resulting in enteric infection. Thus, HIV interacts at many levels to potentiate the development of malabsorption, malnutrition, immune deficiency, and enteric infection.",

Cryptosporidium parvum causes an acute, self-limited diarrheal illness in the immunocompetent host, but in the immunodeficient child with HIV disease, the infection causes a secretory diarrhea that is chronic and debilitating. The organism usually can be identified in the stool by immunofluorescent techniques or by Kinyoun carbolfuchsin stain.7 In HIV-infected children in the United States, the incidence of cryptosporidiosis is lower than that reported in Africa and South America.2, 4, 33\nCryptosporidium can infect the small intestine, colon, gallbladder, biliary tract, and pancreatic duct. No therapy is consistently effective in eradicating the organism, but octreotide is reported to decrease stool output.26 Reports of the beneficial effects of hyperimmune bovine colostrum suggest that this form of passive immunotherapy may be effective in HIV-infected individuals.35 Other enteric parasitic infections, including Isospora belli and Microsporidium, are rarely identified in HIV-infected children; however, Blastocystis hominis, a protozoan whose role as an enteric pathogen is still debated, may be more prevalent in HIV-infected children with diarrhea than in HIV-negative children.3\n",

Gastrointestinal bleeding is unusual in HIV-infected children, but, when present, it may be caused by focal ulcerations in the colon, stomach, small intestine, or esophagus from cytomegalovirus-induced disease. Merely culturing cytomegalovirus from the intestinal mucosa does not establish a link between diarrhea and the infection. Histologic evidence of mucosal injury is necessary.

In addition, pancreatitis in the HIV-infected child is a serious and debilitating illness. Not only do these children experience crampy abdominal pain, but the association with meals results in decreased caloric intake and increases the potential for malnutrition. Lipase seems to be an early and sensitive marker for pancreatitis in the pediatric population.18 Medications such as ddI and ddC are associated with pancreatitis, which may develop following many months of therapy.39 Other medications including pentamidine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and dapsone have been implicated as causes of pancreatitis in children. The development of pancreatitis is an ominous event, and in one published study, the mean survival of children with pancreatitis was 8 months following the diagnosis.18 Because of the guarded outcome, decisions to perform additional diagnostic tests should be made after much discussion with the health care team. If a dilated pancreatic duct is identified by ultrasonography, the indication for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be based on quality-of-life issues.
