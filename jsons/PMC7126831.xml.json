Importantly, although no cases of SARS have been reported since 2004, the virus has not been eradicated and reservoirs of SARS-like viruses exist among bat populations.2\n",

Replication is mediated by the replicase polyprotein, which is translated directly from the viral genome, and is processed by corona viral proteases present in the replicase polyprotein. Two cysteine proteases that reside within the polyprotein, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), each catalyze their own release and liberation of the other nonstructural proteins from the polyprotein. These processes are there by mandatory for virus-mediated RNA replication. PLpro serves other roles because it is not only responsible for processing the viral polyprotein but can also cleave ubiquitin chains and effect deISGylation (ISGlyation is involved in immune response to viruses).3 Since these roles serve as virulence factors which are required for infectivity, PLpro is considered to be an attractive target for antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "Compound 1 was isolated as a yellow oil with molecular formula C25H30O7 established by the [M+] ion at 442.1991 (Calcd 442.1992) in the HREIMS. 1H and 13C NMR data in conjunction with DEPT experiments indicated the presence of 25 carbon atoms, consisting of the following functional groups: 6 methylenes (sp3), 1 methine (sp3), 4 methines (sp2), 3 methyls and 11 quarternary carbons (Table 1\n). The analysis of degrees of unsaturation indicated a tetracyclic skeleton with two aromatic rings. According to its 13C and 1H NMR spectra, compound 1 was found to contain an sp3 methylene (diastereotopic protons: HA\n\u03b4\nH 3.12, dd and HB\n\u03b4\nH 2.74, dd) in the \u03b1-position of the carbonyl group and an oxygenated methine (\u03b4\nH 5.37 dd). The overall NMR characteristics suggested that 1 bears a flavanone backbone. The only notable feature was that H-5\u2032 and H-6\u2032 had the same chemical shift (\u03b4\nH 6.88) and thus were an apparent singlet (an A2 system). HMQC analysis verified that these two protons were in fact on non-equivalent carbons. The remaining proton within this ring, H-2\u2032, was also a singlet and had a chemical shift of \u03b4\nH 7.04. The only arrangement of the ring consistent with three inequivalent proton-substituted carbons and all coupling constants 0 Hz is the proposed structure (3\u2032,5\u2032-disubstitution would lead to a reduction in carbon number due to symmetry and a 2\u2032,3\u2032-disubstitution must lead to ortho coupling between all three peaks). A characteristic hydrogen bonded proton signal of the C-5 (\u03b4\nC 162.7) hydroxyl group was observed at \u03b4\nH 12.47. This is consistent with C-5OH forming a H-bond to the isolated proton at C-8 (A ring, \u03b4\nH 6.03). The connectivity of the C ring was affirmed by COSY correlations of C-2H and C-3H2. HMBC correlation of C-2H with aromatic ring B (principally C-1\u2032) proved the position of the B ring relative to the C ring. The presence of the stereogenic center C-2 is responsible for the chemical inequivalence of the two methylene protons at C-3. HMBC correlation of the ketone function (\u03b4\nC 197.7) with C-3H2 indicated that these two groups were juxtaposed. A weak cross peak between C-3H2 and C4a confirmed that rings A and C were fused. The presence of a 2-hydroxy-2-methylpentyl moiety was deduced from proton coupling networks across H-5\u2032\u2032/H-6\u2032\u2032/H-7\u2032\u2032 in the COSY spectrum and also HMBC correlations between H-7\u2032\u2032/C-8\u2032\u2032, C-9\u2032\u2032 and C-10\u2032\u2032. The presence of two methylene functions at C-1\u2032\u2032 and C-2\u2032\u2032 was confirmed from both a COSY connectivity between 2H-1\u2032\u2032, \u03b4\nH 2.65 and 2H-2\u2032\u2032, \u03b4\nH 1.67 as well as an HMBC correlation of H-2\u2032\u2032 with oxygenated quarternary carbon (C-3\u2032\u2032, \u03b4\nC 73.0). Finally, the geranyl-derived side chain was unveiled to be a 2-methyl-2-(4-hydroxy-4-methylphentyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety by HMBC correlation of C-3\u2032\u2032 with H-2\u2032\u2032, H-4\u2032\u2032 and H-5\u2032\u2032. HMBC correlation of H1\u2032\u2032 with C-5 (\u03b4 162.7), C-6 (\u03b4\nC 110.7) and C-7 (\u03b4\nC 165.6) affirmed the cyclization of this side chain with C-6 and C-7 (Fig. 2\n). The absolute stereochemistry of 1 was elucidated as S on the basis of CD data (a positive absorption at 328 nm and a negative absorption at 288 nm).6 Thus, using the above obtained spectral data, compound 1 was identified as (2S)-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-8-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-8-methyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydropyrano[3,2-g]chromen-4(6H)-one and named tomentin A.",

The difference was the appearance of a 3 proton singlet at \u03b4\nH 3.70, corresponding to methylation of one of the hydroxy groups within the pendant 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ring (B ring). Given the broad spectral similarities between this species and compound 1, we focus on the position of the methyl group. The strongest HMBC correlation for the arylic OCH3 was to a quaternary carbon at 149.4 ppm (C-4\u2032). Correlations were also observed from C-5\u2032H to C-4\u2032 and OCH3 implying that the methoxy group is in the para position to the alkyl substituent.

In conjunction with the mass spectrometric data, the B ring showed characteristics of a trioxygenated arene (R1\n = R2\n = OCH3;R3\n = OH). Since H-2\u2032 and H-6\u2032 were nonequivalent, the position of the lone aromatic hydroxy group must be on C-5\u2032.

HMBC correlation of \u03b4\nH 3.87 with \u03b4\nC 149.2 and \u03b4\nC 146.7 further confirmed that these two OCH3 groups were placed on C-3\u2032 and C-4\u2032, respectively (Fig. 2). 3\u2019s absolute stereochemistry was elucidated as S on the basis of CD data (a positive absorption at 333 nm and a negative absorption at 296 nm).6 Thus, compound 3 was identified as (2S)-5-hydroxy-2-(5-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-8-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-8-methyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydropyrano[3,2-g]chromen-4(6H)-one and named tomentin C.",

Based upon complete assignment of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of this compound using 1D and 2D techniques, closely resembled compound 3 (Table 2). However the 1H NMR clearly showed a 2H singlet at \u03b4\nH 6.73. This corresponding to two arylic CHs in the B ring. Thus 4 is a regioisomer of 3 where the methoxy groups occupy the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 positions on the B ring. Consistent with this symmetrical arrangement within the B ring, C-3\u2032 and C-5\u2032 had identical 13C NMR chemical shifts at \u03b4\nC 148.9 (Fig. 2). CD analysis showed that the absolute stereochemistry of 4 was S (a positive absorption at 331 nm and a negative absorption at 294 nm).6 Thus, compound 4 was identified as (2S)-5-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-8-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-8-methyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydropyrano[3,2-g]chromen-4(6H)-one and named tomentin D.",

Thus this compound contained 11 degrees of unsaturation. 1H and 13C NMR data together with DEPT experiments indicated the presence of 26 carbon atoms, consisting of the following functional groups: 5 methylenes (sp3), 2 methine (sp3), 4 methines (sp2), 4 methyls and 11 quarternary carbons (Table 2). The difference between this species and 1\u20134 was the appearance of one more oxygenated methine (\u03b4\nH 4.68) and disappearance of diastereotopic protons that were present in compounds 1\u20134. The overall NMR characteristic suggested that 5 bears a dihydroflavonol backbone. The B ring was confirmed to be a 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl function as seen in compound 1. This is clear from ortho-coupled protons (\u03b4\nH 6.89 for H-5\u2032 and \u03b4\nH 7.06 for H-6\u2032) and a singlet at \u03b4\nH 7.22 (H-2\u2032) and HMBC correlations of C-3\u2032 (\u03b4\nC 148.6) with OCH3 (\u03b4\nH 3.89) (Fig. 2). The emergence of o-coupling (which was not observed in the compounds above) in this compound stems from the fact that H-5\u2032 and H-6\u2032 no longer have coincidental chemical shifts and thus are not an A2 system. The large coupling constant between H-2 and H-3 [J\n = 11.6 Hz] indicate a trans-diaxial arrangement of these two protons. This agrees with the fact that dihydroflavonols are found in nature only in the 2,3-trans configuration. The absolute stereochemistry of 5 was elucidated as 2R, 3R on the basis of CD data (a positive absorption at 332 nm and a negative absorption at 295 nm).6 Thus, compound 5 was identified as (2R,3R)-3,5-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-8-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-8-methyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydropyrano[3,2-g]chromen-4(6H)-one and named tomentin E.",

            "text": "To investigate the relative inhibitory potency of the twelve isolated compounds (1\u201312) against SARS-CoV PLpro, we measured SARS-CoV PLpro activity in the presence or absence of test compounds using a fluorogenic assay. The SARS-CoV PLpro (residues 1541\u20131855, corresponding to the protease domain)10 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel affinity, ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The apparent Michaelis constant (K\nm\n = 52 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcM) was determined by plotting the initial rates normalized to enzyme concentration (52 nm) versus substrate concentration (1\u2013104 \u03bcM), and fitting the hyperbolic data by non-linear regression using the Michaelis\u2013Menten mode in Sigma Plot (Fig. 3\nA). In SARS-CoV PLpro inhibition assays, all of the compounds tested displayed dose dependent inhibition (IC50 5.0\u201314.4 \u03bcM, Table 3\n). The inhibition of SARS-CoV PLpro by 2, the most potent flavonoid (K\ni\n = 3.5 \u03bcM), is illustrated in Fig. 3 B, C and D, representatively. Plots of residual enzyme activity versus enzyme concentration at different concentrations of compound 2 gave a family straight lines with a y axis intercept of 0; this indicates that 2 is a reversible inhibitor (Fig. 3B). The enzyme inhibition properties of target compounds were modeled using double-reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon analysis). The result show a series of lines, which intersect to the left of the vertical axis and above the horizontal axis (Fig. 3C). This implies that increasing inhibitor concentration leads to a decrease in V\nmax and an increase in K\nm, indicating that compound 2 was a mixed-type inhibitor (Fig. 3D). Thus the inhibitor binds to an allosteric site on the enzyme. The K\ni values of all compounds were measured by Dixon plot (Table 3).",

We set out to validate the medicinally used plant, Paulownia tomentosa, as a rich source of inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro. We chose to screen for inhibitors of this protease because it is a promising drug target since the enzyme is required for numerous processes in the viral life cycle. Our search led us to previously undisclosed natural products, which bear an unusual 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran motif. This structural arrangement was found to be more effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV PLpro enzyme than the parent compounds that were cyclization precursors. This clearly underscores the importance of unearthing new or rare architectures from natural products. These novel natural products may be of general interest to the drug industry and natural product chemists.",

The gene was ligated into a PCR-TOPO (Invitrogen, USA) and the inserted gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing with T7 forward and T7 terminal reverse primers. Then, the correct gene fragment was transferred into a pPRoEx HT expression vector (Invitrogen, USA) and transformed into DH5\u03b1 competent cells. The expression plasmid was constructed to carry a His6-tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site at the N-terminus. Correct clones of the PLpro in the pPRoEX HT vector were identified and verified by PCR, restriction digestion with BamHI and XhoI and sequencing. The plasmid pPRoEx HT harbouring the PLpro gene was transformed into an E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) for protein expression. A 10 ml aliquot of an overnight culture was seeded into 1000 ml of fresh LB (Luria-Bertani) medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin and cells were grown to OD600 nm of 0.6 at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were cooled down in ice for 30 min and protein expression was induced for 5 h with 0.4 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 30 \u00b0C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 6 min at 4 \u00b0C. The harvested cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was used directly for purification or stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.",

The column was washed first with 20 column volumes of binding buffer and then with 2 column volumes of washing buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole). The recombinant PLpro proteins were eluted with the elution buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and 300 mM imidazole). The PLpro eluted from the nickel column was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography using a salt gradient with a SOURCE 15Q column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 and 2 mM DTT. The PLpro was finally purified by size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. The fractions containing PLpro were pooled, exchanged into 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0 and 10 mM DTT and concentrated to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-30, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA). The protein purity was examined by SDS\u2013PAGE and native-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford method (Bradford, 1976) using bovine serum albumin as the standard.

The substrate contains the five C-terminal residues of human ubiquitin with a C-terminal 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) group. Hydrolysis of the AMC-peptide bond dramatically increases the fluorescence of AMC, allowing conversion to be accurately determined. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 250 \u03bcL, which contained the following components: 20 mM Tris-buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT, 52 \u03bcM Z-RLRGG-AMC, 2% DMSO, and varying concentrations of inhibitor (0\u2013200 \u03bcM).
