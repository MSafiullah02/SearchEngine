A public health emergency of international concern was declared by the World Health Organization, at the end of January, based on human-to-human spread of the virus and the extensive movement of people within and from China during the intense Chinese New Year travel period. (Chen, Liu, & Guo, 2020) . Based on genetic properties, 2019-nCoV belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus. In a positive sign of research collaboration, 2019-nCoV sequences are being shared to enable analysis to generate insights into this novel pathogen (https ://gisaid.org/CoV2020).",

They also have a close phylogenic relationship with bat coronaviruses, which might indicate a bat origin of the viruses (Chan et al, 2020). However, intermediate hosts-such as bamboo rat and badger-might be important in the transmission cycle since several early 2019-nCoV cases were vendors in the market where they could have been exposed to wild animals that are sold in this market. Epidemiologic analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan has indicated that most (55%) with onset before January 1 were linked to this market in Wuhan, compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases .",

By analysing the released 2019-nCoV sequences and comparing among different animal species with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis, the authors suggested that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for 2019-nCoV through recombination within spike glycoprotein. Currently, there is no report of 2019-nCoV having been isolated from animal species, but this is a topic of much speculation. (95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.9) and 2.68 (95% credible interval 2.47-2.86) Wu et al., 2020) . Although these are less than that estimated for SARS (3.0), it highlights the challenge for control given that spread to major, densely populated Chinese cities has already occurred Wu et al., 2020) , and the strain on resources with an estimated epidemic doubling time of 6.4 days (95% credible interval 5.8-7.1) . It can be assumed that what began as a point source epidemic in Wuhan quickly has become an extended propagating pandemic. Of concern are super-spreading events, which are yet to be identified .",

With the increased number of human infection cases and extended geographical distribution, human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV was confirmed(Chan et al., 2020).Although the viruses were successfully isolated from cells, the exact infection mechanisms remain unclear. The computational remodelling of 2019-nCoV S-protein, the virus protein binding to host receptors, revealed its high tendency to interact with human ACE2 receptor(Xu et al., 2020), which could explain the high efficiency of transmission via respiratory droplets between close contacts.The numbers of reported 2019-nCoV infections have increased rapidly, and many countries have reported infections for the first time. This indicates the disease has broad geographical, security and political implications. Whilst the control of an infectious respiratory disease relies on established principles of early detection, isolation, hygiene and social distancing, we face many gaps in our knowledge of this new pathogen such as its source, immunity in exposed individuals, the potential for vaccine development and the accuracy of diagnosis. How this pathogen emerged and the drivers of that emergence will be the subject of intense research in the months and years to come. With the examples of SARS and MERS-in which wildlife such as bats have been identified as a reservoir-2019-",
