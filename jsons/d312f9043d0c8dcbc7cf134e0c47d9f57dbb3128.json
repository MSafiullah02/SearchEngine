We have been nimble, moving quickly from ideas to application and practice. Volunteer workforces and non-clinical staff have stepped up to support areas with critical needs. Education for hospital staff, communities and the media, has been part of the effort to limit transmission chains, including keeping individuals with mild symptoms at home and out of emergency rooms and clinics. Many of us are following best practices by meeting virtually to share and disseminate knowledge across our institutions. Collaborative research ideas and protocols are abundant.
