Our hypotheses were: 1) prior warmup exercise would increase aerobic energy production and decrease the rate of muscle glycogen degradation and the anaerobic contribution to energy production during subsequent sprint exercise, and 2) higher intensity warmup exercise would further enhance the aerobic energy contribution to total energy expenditure. Six fit Standardbred horses exercised at 115% VO 2max until fatigued (sprint exercise [SPR]), after each of three protocols: 1) no warm-up (NoWU); 2) 10 min of trotting at 50% VO 2max (LoWU); and 3) 7 min at 50% VO 2max followed by 45s intervals at 80, 90, and 100% VO 2max (HiWU). Respiratory gas exchange (VO 2 , VCO 2 ) and accumulated O 2 deficit (AOD) were measured during warmup and SPR. Mixed venous blood samples were obtained before and after warmup, and post SPR. Middle gluteal muscle samples for measurement of metabolite concentrations (ATP, PCr, G-6-P, muscle lactate [La mu ], glycogen) and calculation of the rate of ATP provision from anaerobic pathways were collected before and immediately after SPR.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 3 diets with variable soluble CHO and fat content and the effect of variable exercise intensity (gallop, canter, or trot) on plasma CK and plasma lactate (PL) concentration in TB horses with RER. Five TB with RER and 3 healthy TB were used. Diagnosis was established by the intermittent occurrence of exercise associated muscle cramping accompanied by elevated CK and abnormal caffeine contracture tests. Diets were formulated to meet (21.4 Mcal DE/day for low CHO and fat diets) or exceed daily requirements (28.8 Mcal DE/day for high CHO diet). Diets were fed in a crossover design for 3 week blocks. Horses exercised on a treadmill Mon. through Fri. Max speed on Mon. and Fri. was 11 m/s (6% slope), on Tue. and Thu. 9 m/s and on Wed. 4.5 m/s. Venous blood was obtained before, after and 4 h after exercise. Data was analyzed using an analysis of variance. RER horses had higher pre, but not post exercise, PL compared to controls. PL and CK were not correlated in RER horses (r 2 \u03ed 0.01). There was no effect of diet or exercise intensity on CK in controls. RER horses consuming the high CHO diet had a greater increase in CK compared to the low CHO or fat diets (mean \u03ee sem,High CHO 561 \u03ee 109 U/l, low CHO 95 \u03ee 109 U/l, p\u03ed 0.002, fat 273 \u03ee 106 U/l, p\u03ed 0.06). RER horses exercised at the trot or canter had significantly greater increases in CK compared to galloped RER horses (Canter 384 \u03ee 96 U/l, Trot 439 \u03ee 126 U/l, Gallop 106 \u03ee 97 U/l, p\u03ed 0.04). RER horses fed the high CHO diet and trotted had the greatest post exercise CK (1226 \u03ee 168 U/l). Therefore, in TB horses susceptible to RER, diets high in CHO, formulated to exceed daily requirements, increase episodes of rhabdomyolysis. However rhabdomyolysis was not associated with high PL and occurred at speeds below the lactate threshold.",

Data were obtained for all cases of LDA, RDA, and AV in beef cattle admitted to the TAMU-VTH from 1/1/88 to 11/1/98. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for breed and sex were computed. There were 14 AV's, 4 RDA's and 1 LDA. The LDA occurred in a 13-mon-old Brahman bull presented for abdominal distension of 3 days' and the bull survived. There were 7 Brahmans, 5 crossbreeds, 3 Beefmasters, 2 Brangus and 1 Santa Gertrudis with RDA or AV. Twelve were males. The median age was 10 mon(range, 1 to 72 mon) . Brahman cattle were more likely to develop RDA or AV than were other beef cattle (OR \u03ed8.4 ; CI 95 \u03ed 3.8-18.5). Males were more likely to develop RDA or AV than were females (OR \u03ed3.6; CI 95 \u03ed 1.4-9.0). Abdominal distention was observed in 11, heart rate \u0546100 bpm in 14, and the abomasum was palpable on all of which a rectal examination was performed. Leukocytosis (7/10), neutrophilia (7/10), hyperglycemia (9/9), azotemia (9/9), hypochloremia (12/13) and hypokalemia (8/13) were frequent laboratory findings. Twelve of 18 survived, but 3 had ruptured abomasa at surgery. The duration of signs before examination in beef cattle was longer(median duration \u03ed 3 days), but the survival rate in those without abomasal rupture was similar to that of dairy cattle.

College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI. During 1997-98, 67 Michigan horses were confirmed to have equine Cushings disease on the basis of characteristic clinical signs and the results of either a dexamethasone suppression test (DST), a thyrotropin (TRH) stimulaton test, or an elevated serum insulin concentration (\u03fe300 pmol/l). Presenting complaints included hirsuitism, hyperhidrosis, and muscle wasting. A substantial number (52%) had chronic laminitis as the major clinical problem. Changes in endocrine test results were compared after 6 months in horses that were either untreated (NT) or treated with pergolide (P, 2 ug/kg PO, q 24 h) or cyproheptidine (C, 1.2 mg/kg 3/4 PO, q 24 h). Ten horses had died or were euthanatized within the first 6 months with 70% attributable to complications of Cushings disease. As of the start of 1999, 6 month evaluations had been completed for 19 horses and were pending for 19 horses. 19 horses failed to remain on treatment for 6 months or had incomplete follow-up testing. Preliminary results (Table) support that treatment of equine Cushings disease warrants pursuit and that reversal of abnormal endocrine test results (DST/TRH) appears to be better with pergolide (6/9 \u03ed 67%) than with cyproheptidine (2/6 \u03ed 33%). In addition to being more problematic in terms of sample collection and handling when used under field conditions, preliminary results suggest that measurement of plasma ACTH concentration may be the least reliable diagnostic test for equine Cushings disease. Equine RAO is characterized by the development of clinical signs of airway obstruction and an airspace neutrophilia following exposure of susceptible horses to mouldy forage. We investigated the functional state of blood and airspace neutrophils (PMN) from RAO susceptible horses after a 5 h hay/straw challenge.",

The interaction between reactive oxygen species, proteases and antiproteases in the microenvironment of the pulmonary epithelium may play a role in the pathogenesis of equine RAO. Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) occurs frequently in racehorses. Exercising horses develop severe pulmonary capillary hypertension, and the ensuing high transmural pulmonary capillary pressure contributes to the stress failure of pulmonary capillaries, resulting in EIPH. Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous vasodilator substance, which plays an important role in modulating the pulmonary vascular tone. Thus, in the present study, we investigated whether IV administration of nitroglycerin-a known NO donor, would attenuate the exercise-induced pulmonary capillary hypertension, and thereby, affect the incidence of EIPH in strenuously exercising racehorses. Five healthy, sound, exercise-trained Thoroughbred horses were studied at rest and during incremental treadmill exercise performed at 6, 8 and 14.2m/s on a 5% uphill grade in the control (no medications) and nitroglycerin (20g/kg/min, IV) experiments. Galloping at 14.2m/s on a 5% uphill grade elicited maximal heart rate (212 \u03ee 2 beats/min), and the horses could not sustain this workload for \u03fe90s. The nitroglycerin dosage for our experiments was selected based on separate trials in standing horses where it was demonstrated that maximal pulmonary/systemic hemodynamic effects of IV nitroglycerin are elicited at 5g/kg/min, and that increasing the dose 4-fold (to 20g/kg/min) did not cause any ill effects. In control experiments, exercise resulted in a significant (P\u03fd0.05) progressive increase in right atrial as well as pulmonary arterial, capillary and wedge pressures, and all horses experienced EIPH. Nitroglycerin infusion significantly (P\u03fd0.05) decreased the right atrial and pulmonary vascular pressures of standing horses while heart rate increased significantly. In the nitroglycerin-infusion experiments, exercise at 6 and 8m/s also resulted in a progressive significant (P\u03fd0.05) rise in the right atrial as well as pulmonary arterial, capillary and wedge pressures, but these values were found to be significantly (P\u03fd0.05) less than in the control experiments. However, this did not occur during galloping at 14.2m/s on a 5% uphill grade, when right atrial and pulmonary arterial, capillary and wedge pressures approached values observed in the control experiments, and all horses experienced EIPH. Thus, while IV nitroglycerin significantly attenuated the exercise-induced pulmonary capillary hypertension at sub-maximal workloads, attenuation did not occur during high-intensity exertion and the incidence of EIPH remained unaffected. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of glucose infusion on glucose kinetics in horses during exercise. We hypothesized that increased blood glucose availability would suppress the exercise-induced increment in hepatic glucose production (HGP) but increase whole-body disposal of blood glucose. In random order, 6 Standardbred horses completed two exercise trials consisting of running on a treadmill for 90 min at 34 \u03ee 1% of peak oxygen uptake. In one trial (Glu) glucose was infused for the duration of exercise at a mean rate of 34.9 \u03ee 1.1 mol/kg/min, while in the other trial (Con) an equivalent volume of saline was infused. In both trials, a primed constant-rate infusion of the stable isotopically-labeled tracer [6,6-2 H]glucose was given for measurement of glucose kinetics. Blood samples for determination of plasma glucose concentrations and isotopic enrichment (GCMS analysis) were collected at regular intervals. The rates of appearance (R a ) and disappearance (R d ) of glucose were determined by using a one-pool non-steady-state kinetic model. In Con, glucose R a was assumed to reflect HGP, whereas in Glu HGP was calculated as the difference between the measured total R a and the rate of glucose infusion.",

In Con, HGP increased from 6.3 \u03ee 1.5 mol/kg/min at rest to 29.6 \u03ee 2.5 mol/kg/min after 90 min of exercise. In Glu, there was complete suppression of the increase in HGP during the first 45 min of exercise. Although HGP increased during the remainder of exercise in Glu, values were 50-60% lower when compared to Con. During exercise, glucose R d increased in both trials. However, between 30 and 90 min of exercise, values were 50-75% higher (P\u03fd0.001) in Glu than in Con. These results indicate that: 1) exogenous glucose infusion suppresses the exercise-associated increase in HGP in horses during low-intensity exercise; and 2) increased glucose availability enhances utilization of plasma glucose during exercise, as reflected by the higher values for glucose R d in Glu. Importantly, these data demonstrate the utility of the stable-isotope tracer method for determination of glucose flux in horses during exercise. Multiple logistic regression models available in the literature to predict outcome of cows with a definitive diagnosis of right abomasal displacement or abomasal volvulus (RDA/AV) were evaluated using data from the veterinary teaching hospital (VTH) of the FMV Saint-Hyacinthe. A retrospective study was conducted on the medical records of cows admitted to the VTH from 1989 to 1994 with RDA/AV (n\u03ed295). It was followed by a prospective study conducted on 131 RDA/AV cases admitted to the VTH from 1995 to 1998.",

Primary influenza virus infection (Group 3) produced identical IgG sub-isotype responses, but also generated a nasal IgA response. DNA vaccination was associated with lymphoproliferative responses in PBLs and inguinal LNLs, while influenza virus infection was associated with responses in PBLs, and hilar LNLs. The inguinal LNL lymphoproliferative responses in IL-6/HA DNA vaccinates (Group 2) were higher than in the HA DNA vaccinates (Group 1). Examination of cytokine production profiles indicates that these protective immune responses subsequent to DNA vaccination, or infection, are associated with different regional regulatory mechanisms. Our ability to design novel strategies to prevent infectious disease in the young calf is restricted by our limited understanding of how non-immunoglobulin maternal factors contribute to the immune system of the newborn. There is indirect evidence in cattle that maternal immune cells and antigen-specific immune cell responses are transferred to the calf. The aim of this study was to provide definitive genetic evidence for the transfer of cells from the cow to the newborn calf. This was achieved by using a sensitive and specific PCR-based assay to search calf immune tissues for maternal cells. The non-inherited allele of the bovine MHC BoLA-DRB3 gene was selected as a genetic marker for maternal cells since this is a highly polymorphic gene and therefore likely to be different between dam and calf. Genomic DNA was isolated from the PBMCs of ten Holstein cow-calf pairs. The BoLA-DRB3 genotype of each individual was determined using a technique combining PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and automated sequencing. Four cow-calf pairs in which the non-inherited maternal BoLA-DRB3 allele (NIMDA) differed from the calf BoLA-DRB3 alleles were selected for study. Calves were fed 2 liters of fresh colostrum from their dam within 6 hours of birth, and maintained on commercial milk replacer. Calves were euthanized at 48-60 hours of age and multiple tissues collected at necropsy. Enriched lymphocyte populations were harvested from the intestinal epithelium, lamina propria, and Peyer's patches. The cow and calf BoLA-DRB3 alleles were aligned and PCR NIMDA-specific primers designed. Using these primers the maternal allele was successfully amplified from intraepithelial lymphocytes (2/4 calves), Peyer's patch (3/4 calves), mesenteric lymph node (2/4 calves), spleen (2/4 calves), and precolostral PBMCs (3/4 calves). The distribution of the NIM-DA varied between calves. Further studies using NIMDA-specific primers and NIMDA-specific DNA probes for in situ PCR on tissue sections of intestine and lymph nodes showed a homogeneous population of NIMDA-positive cells scattered throughout lymph node cortices and Peyer's patches. No positive cells were observed in sections using control primers and probes. These findings provide evidence for the transfer of maternal cells from the cow to the newborn calf. The presence of viable maternal immune cells in calf lymphoid tissues would suggest a role in calf immune system function or development. Clostridium difficile is associated with enterocolitis in adult horses and foals. Difficulty in isolating this organism through culture has likely led to it being overlooked in many cases. C.difficile exerts its effects through the production of exotoxins, but since non-toxigenic strains occur, definitive diagnosis requires identification of either toxins in feces, or the ability of isolates to produce toxins. This study evaluates the association of C.difficile with equine enterocolitis and examines the discepancy between bacterial culture and toxin identification.",

Survival time under these conditions varied from less than one to 46 days. The persistence of toxins was evaluated as well. 3 toxin positive fecal samples stored at 4 0 C were repeatedly tested and toxin was detected for greater than 30 days. Further, 4 toxigenic strains were grown in cooked meat broth (CMB) medium to induce toxin production. Toxin persisted in CMB and in feces stored at 4 0 C for greater than 30 days. The variability in survival of the organism when compared to the persistence of toxin and the rarity of toxin in healthy horses suggests that a diagnosis of C.difficile enterocolitis can be made in the absence of successful culture of the organism. Although the term laminitis indicates an inflammatory process, there are, to our knowledge, no previous reports of the involvement of inflammatory mediators in the onset of equine laminitis. In fact, the role of inflammation in early laminitis has been questioned due to the paucity of white blood cells in the laminitic digit. We investigated the gene expression of the pivotal inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) by cellular components of the palmar digital vasculature and laminar tissue in the early stages of laminitis. Horses were anesthetized 2-3 hours after administration of black walnut extract (BW, n\u03ed5) or placebo (n\u03ed3); the time point was dictated by the onset of neutropenia in the BW horses. Hemodynamic measurements were performed in one front foot while the digital vessels and laminar tissue in the opposite foot were fixed via formalin perfusion prior to tissue collection. In situ hybridization using equine-specific riboprobes for IL-1b was performed. Whereas no IL-1b message was apparent in control laminar tissues, there was marked IL-1b expression by endothelial cells of laminar capillaries in laminitic equine digits. No expression of IL-1b was noted in the palmar digital vessels, nor in the digital arterioles or venules. These results suggest a role of inflammation in the early laminitic disease process. Importantly, we have demonstrated gene expression of IL-1b by cell components of the laminar capillary wall, suggesting that the inflammatory process may be a local phenomenon within the laminitic digit.",

            "text": "These results suggest a role for plasmid encoded products in downregulating INF-\u2425 production as part of the pathogenesis of R. equi infection in foals. Introduction of DNA encoding a single antigen stimulates a highly specific immune response to the expressed protein. In the case of antigens for which cloned genes are available, this enables direct vaccination without the need for purification of recombinant protein. This approach offers considerable advantages for generating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to recently cloned molecules, including equine cytokines. There are currently few monoclonal antibodies recognizing equine cytokines, and the availability of these reagents would provide a potent and novel means of characterizing equine immune responses. A study was performed to generate mABs to equine interleukin 2 (eq IL-2), employing biolistic DNA vaccination techniques to immunize mice. The eq IL-2 gene was subcloned into a suitable plasmid vector, coated onto gold beads, and administered percutaneously to the abdominal skin of Balb/c mice using a PowderJect-XR gene gun; 7.5g of plasmid DNA was given to each mouse on three occasions. Mice with the greatest immune response to eq IL-2 were selected by ELISA using supernatant from a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line expressing recombinant equine IL-2 (rEq IL-2) as the capture antigen. Fusion of splenocytes to NS-1 myeloma cells was performed. A paired ELISA was developed to select hybridomas. CHO cell supernatants were used as capture antigens to identify hybridomas. Positive hybridomas were cloned twice by limiting dilution. Functional assays were performed by evaluating the ability of anti-eq IL-2 mABs to block ConA-stimulated lymphocyte proliferations. Antibody specificity was confirmed with immunoblot assays and by affinity purification of equine IL-2. Development of eq IL-2 ELISA and ELISPOT detection systems was also undertaken. Overall this approach to mAb production, and these specific anti-IL-2 reagents, represent potent tools for examining equine immune responses. Viable larvae of infective L3 stage Haemonchus contortus were utilized to generate cell populations for in-vitro propagation in a tissue culture environment. A variety of laboratory strategies were applied to validate the identify of H. contortus-derived cell populations including biochemical profile analysis for detecting the expression of phosphorylhydrolase, and aminopeptidase-M (ApM, zinc-metaloprotease) like activity utilizing enzyme-specific substrates (e.g. nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP), leucine-para-nitroanaline (leucine-pNA)). Significance of these experimental finding are directly related to the known expression of both phosphorylhydrolase, and ApM like biochemical activity by cell types populating the luminal surface of the nematode digestive system.",

Endoscopic biopsies of gastric mucosa were tested for urease activity and evaluated by cytology for the presence of spiral organisms consistent with Helicobacter spp. Fecal cytology was evaluated for the presence of spore-forming rods, spirochetes, and leukocytes. Fecal material was cultured for Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter jejuni. We assessed feces also for Cryptosporidium parvum using IFA and PCR; for Giardia by ELISA and IFA; for C. perfringens enterotoxin by ELISA; for enteric viruses by electron microscopy; and for enteric parasites by zinc sulfate flotation. In addition, serum was collected for feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity (fTLI), cobalamin, and folate concentration determinations.

The effect of reduced frequency of administration of misoprostol on its ability to prevent aspirin-induced gastric injury was evaluated. Twenty-four randomsource dogs were divided into 4 groups which received aspirin and misoprostol as follows: Group I, 25 mg/kg aspirin PO TID and placebo PO TID; Group II, 25 mg/kg aspirin PO TID and misoprostol 3 ug/kg PO TID; Group III, 25 mg/ kg aspirin PO TID, misoprostol 3 ug/kg PO BID and placebo PO QD; and Group IV, 25 mg/kg aspirin PO TID, misoprostol 3 ug/kg PO QD and placebo PO BID for 28 days. Groups were stratified for Helicobacter status based on results of 'CLO test'. Gastroscopy was performed on days 9, 5, 14 and 28. Each region of the stomach was evaluated separately and visible lesions were scored on a scale of 1 (submucosal hemorrhage) to 11 (perforating ulcer). Median total score for each group was compared at each day using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Median total score within each group between days was compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test.",

Results further revealed substantial fermentation of the remaining markers, which may result in bias interpretation of data from previous intestinal permeability studies. The purpose of this retrospective study was to characterize imaging findings in cats with confirmed upper gastrointestinal inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to relate these findings to clinical signs and histologic changes. Medical records for 33 cats with a clinical and histopathologic diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal IBD were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs, clinicopathologic findings, radiographic and ultrasonographic findings, and results of endoscopic examination. Histologic findings were reviewed and characterized by severity and type of inflammatory infiltrate.",

Colonoscopy appears to be a safe procedure. Apoptotic cell death accompanies cholestatic hepatic disease. Since cholestatic disorders are associated with increased serum and tissue bile acid concentrations and bile acids are known hepatotoxins, it is likely that bile acids contribute to the ongoing pathology in many chronic hepatopathies. We and others have demonstrated that hydrophobic bile acids induce apoptosis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures and have used this in vitro model to study the mechanisms associated with bile acid induced hepatotoxicity. Since hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to protect neuronal and gastric epithelial cells from apoptosis, we explored the role of HGF in modulating bile acid induced hepatocyte apoptosis. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion and plated on cover slips or tissue culture flasks coated with Type I collagen in Minimal Eagles Medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum. Four hours after plating, experiments were initiated by adding 50 um glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) and hepatocytes evaluated by Hoechst staining for morphologic evidence of apoptosis (chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation). The effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on GCDC induced apoptosis was evaluated by pretreating cultures for 15 minutes with 50 ng/ml of HGF or EGF prior to the addition of the bile acid. Treatment with GCDC alone induced apoptosis in 29.7\u03ee 3.2 % of hepatocytes. HGF significantly reduced the amount of GCDC induced apoptosis by 60.2 \u03ee 7.8 % while EGF had little effect (19.1 \u03ee 8.9% reduction in apoptosis). The protective effect of HGF was prevented in the presence of 50 uM wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositol-3-OH kinase. HGF mediated cytoprotection was accompanied by phosphosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) as determined on immunblots of cell extracts with phosphospecific antibodies. Pretreatment with 50 uM wortmannin prevented HGF mediated activation of PKB. HGF mediated protection against bile acid induced apoptosis in rat hepataocytes may involve sequential activation of PI3K and PKB. Since HGF is produced by nonparenchymal cells in the liver, we hypothesize that it exerts a paracrine effect on hepatocytes to promote cell survival. The effects of a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) on gastric emptying were evaluated utilizing scintigraphy in 13 cats (complete block design). In order to differentiate between administration route (ingestion vs infusion) and the presence of the gastrostomy tube (present or not present), gastric emptying was compared between three combinations: 1) no G-tube, food ingested; 2) G-tube present, food infused; 3) G-tube present, food ingested. Thirteen cats were accommodated to a commercial canned diet (CNM-CV Purina Inc.) for 2 weeks. The diet was labeled with 99m Tc-disofenin. After ingestion, gastric images were taken at 12 intervals for 5 hours.",

Therefore, it can be recommended that liver parameters be evaluated at least 6 weeks after discontinuation of PB, and significantly abnormal findings should lead the clinician to re-evaluate the dog for hepatotoxicity or other primary liver disease. In addition, TT4 and FT4 decreases resolved 1 and 5 weeks after withdrawal, respectively. In dogs with suspected hypothyroidism, it is recommended that thyroid values be evaluated at least 6 weeks following cessation of PB. Feline hyperesthesia syndrome is a commonly recognized but poorly understood disorder characterized by paroxysmal agitation, focal spasms of the thoracolumbar epaxial muscles, vocalization, biting of the caudal trunk and pelvic limbs, and exaggerated tail movements. Pharmacological therapy including prednisone, amitriptyline, phenobarbital, carnitine, and coenzyme-Q 10 is often unrewarding. Five cats with compatible signs underwent a battery of tests which included a complete neurological examination, a CBC, biochemistry profile, spinal radiographs, electromyography (EMG), and histological, histochemical, and immunocytochemical evaluation of fresh frozen muscle biopsy specimens. Infectious disease screening tests (FeLV, FIV, Toxoplasma gondii (n\u03ed4) and Feline syncytia-forming virus (FSV) (n\u03ed1), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (n\u03ed3) and electroencephalography (n\u03ed1) were performed. Four of five cats had a chronic, intermittent to progressive clinical course over a 1 to 2 year period before presentation. All cats were between 5 and 8 years of age with no apparent sex predilection. No neurological deficits were detected in any of the cats; however, zones of apparent hyperpathia were present in thoracolumbar epaxial muscles in 4 cats. Hematological and biochemical parameters were within normal limits with the exception of elevated globulin levels in 2 cats. Spinal radiographs were normal in all cats. Spontaneous EMG activity was found in a multifocal distribution within thoracolumbar epaxial muscles. The majority of spontaneous activity was found in the mid-thoracic segments and consisted of fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, complex repetitive discharges, and trains of giant motor unit potentials. No abnormalities were found in appendicular muscles. Infectious disease testing, CSF analysis, and electroencephalography were unremarkable in those cats tested with the exception of a positive FSV titer (1: 16) in 1 cat. Epaxial muscle biopsies (5/5) contained numerous rimmed vacuoles, the contents of which were positively labeled with monoclonal antibodies against paired helical filaments and \u2424-amyloid. Vacuoles were not observed in muscles from 10 unaffected cats. The rimmed vacuoles and antibody labeling patterns are similar to that described in inclusion body myositis/myopathy in humans. Dogs in status epilepticus often need to be heavily sedated or anesthetized to halt seizure activity. Such measures preclude the administration of oral anticonvulsants. In those patients already receiving an adequate dose of phenobarbital, the ability to safely and effectively administer a loading dose of potassium bromide (KBr) intrarectally may allow for improved short and long-term seizure control. The purpose of this study was to determine the peak drug concentrations and bioavailability of an intrarectal KBr loading dose in dogs, as well as to evaluate the safety and potential side-effects of a 24-hour intrarectal loading protocol. Four normal adult female-spayed hound dogs, weighing an average of 22.3 kg (range: 19.1-26 kg), were used in a two-way crossover design. Each dog was administered a loading dose (600 mg/kg) of sterile KBr solution (concentration 250 mg/ml) over 24 hours, via six intrarectal (IR) boluses (100 mg/ kg, q 4h). Serum samples for bromide and potassium (K \u03e9 ) concentrations were obtained every 2 hours during the loading period, and weekly thereafter for bromide, until the concentrations were below the limit of quantitation. At this point, two dogs were re-loaded over 24 hours as a continuous rate intravenous infusion. The gold chloride method was used to determine serum bromide concentrations. The average serum bromide concentration after IR loading was 0.92 mg/ml (range: 0.81-1.11 mg/ml), and after IV loading was 1.18 mg/ml (range: 1.13-1.22 mg/ml). The average peak serum K \u03e9 concentration during KBr loading was 5.87 mEq/L (range: 5.5-6.8 mEq/L) and 5.7 mEq/L (range: 5.6-5.8 mEq/ L) for IR and IV loading, respectively (normal range: 3.5-5.5 mEq/L). Mean half-life (t 1/2 ) of IR KBr was 488.8 hours, or 20.4 days. A side-effect of both IR and IV KBr loading was mild sedation, and of IR loading was transient diarrhea. Preliminary bioavailability (F) of intrarectally administered bromide was calculated in 2 dogs (F\u03edAUC {rectal}/ AUC {intravenous}) to be 57.7 %. Results indicate that KBr is well absorbed rectally and that a 24-hour intrarectal loading protocol is safe to administer in normal dogs. Periodic monitoring of serum phenobarbital (PB) concentrations (PBC) in epileptic dogs is important because seizure control correlates best with serum PBC and not dosage. It has been recommended that serum PBC be measured at either trough (zero hour) or peak (three to six hours post dosing) times, but this can be inconvenient due to the difficulty in scheduling around a set dosing interval. The purpose of this study was to evaluate trough and peak serum PBC in epileptic dogs to determine whether there are significant differences in serum PBC occurring throughout a dosing interval.",

The pathological and clinical features of the disease are similar to the human disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and have been well described, but biochemical data on a large number of affected animals has not been reported. This retrospective study characterize the pattern of laboratory findings and relevant histopathological changes in a large number of dogs with inherited HCSMA. We reviewed medical records of 54 affected dogs (January 1993-December 1998) including 43 affected adult dogs (mean age 5.6 years) heterozygous (HTZs) for HCSMA and 11 affected ho ozygote (HMZs) pup (mean age 13 wks). Laboratory data included complete blood counts, serum chemistries, CSF analysis, T3 and T4 measurements, urinalysis, and necropsy findings. Serum levels of vitamin E were measured in 7 HMZs and 14 HTZs. Except for the the clinical signs of HCSMA, all animals were normal on physical examination, were ambulatory and were able to eat and drink. A mild regenerative anemia was identified in 43% of the HTZs and 77% of the HMZs. Other abnormalities included increases (2.6-fold) in AST (SGOT), and ALP in \u03f315% of the HTZs. Hypoglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia were present in \u03f332% of the HTZs. Serum levels of vitamin E in the HMZs were significantly lower (P\u03ed0.001) than the HTZs or the age matched controls. Histologically, the livers of both HTZs and HMZs were generally unremarkable except for only rare, micronodular inflammatory foci. A few crypts were mildly dilated in the small intestine of several HTZs. Denervation muscle atrophy was present in all dogs; focal muscle necrosis was observed in several older HTZs.",

We interpreted the anemia as reduced erythropoiesis, possibly related to chronic disease. The mild liver lesions may be associated with the elevation in AST (SGOT) and ALP. Additional sources of increased AST could include skeletal muscle and RBCs. The cause of low serum levels of albumin and immunoglobulins is unclear, because there was no significant intestinal pathology, renal protein loss, or nutritional deficit. Low levels of the antioxidant vitamin E in HCSMA are consistent with similar findings reported in equine motor neuron disease, and suggest a role for oxidant injury in HCSMA. The significance of the abnormal laboratory findings in a limited number of dogs with HCSMA warrant further study to elucidate their potential association with the disease process. Fourteen miniature wirehaired dachshunds (MWHD) were evaluated for repetitive muscle contractions (twitching), seizures and hypnic jerks. Age of onset ranged from 6 to 13 years of age (median 7 years) and 5 males and 9 females were affected. Neurological examination was normal except for the observed twitching, and neither muscle atrophy, weakness or exercise intolerance were evident. Twitching occurred spontaneously (11/14) and could be elicited by sudden movements in the visual field (14/14), sudden changes in light intensity (10/ 14), and sudden noise (7/14). The seizures included impaired consciousness, extended or paddling limbs, foaming at the mouth, vocalizing and urinating. Occasionally the seizures followed a violent train of twitching (3/12). Hypnic jerks occurred at rest or when asleep. Laboratory evaluations including complete blood counts, serum chemistry profiles, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were within normal limits.",

Fresh frozen and formalin fixed biopsies from the triceps and vastus lateralis muscles were evaluated from 7 affected dogs. In muscles from 5 of 7 dogs, intense periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive, diastase resistant inclusions (polyglucosan bodies) were present beneath the sarcolemma and between myofibrils. Ultrastructurally, glycogen particles, dense granular material and filamentous aggregates were present in subsarcolemmal spaces. A peripheral nerve specimen was available from one dog and showed similar polyglucosan bodies in the axoplasm of myelinated fibers. Filamentous accumulations of PAS positive, diastase resistant material may be associated with phosphofructokinase deficiency, branching enzyme deficiency, polyglucosan body disease, polysaccharide storage myopathy, and Lafora disease. The clinical presentation of progressive myoclonic epilepsy with the absence of muscle weakness, the lack of hypoglycemia or liver disease, and the presence of polyglucosan bodies within the muscle biopsies is consistent with a diagnosis of Lafora disease in the MWHD. The underlying metabolic abnormality in Lafora disease is as yet unknown. The clinical presentation, muscle immunohistochemistry, and immunophenotype of invading myocytotoxic T lymphocytes were evaluated in 7 young Newfoundlands with a newly recognized breed associated polymyositis. Age of disease onset, sex distribution of affected dogs, frequency of specific clinical signs, and serum biochemical abnormalities were collectively evaluated. Fresh frozen muscle biopsies were examined with histochemical stains as well as with the immunoreagent SPA-HRPO.

The above sarcolemmal staining strongly suggests an immune-mediated etiology against a component of the sarcolemmal membrane itself. Myelography is currently the preferred means of diagnosing canine intervertebral disc disease. However, myelograms can cause worsening of neurological signs and seizures. The aim of this study was to describe the computed tomographic (CT) appearance of acute intervertebral disc herniations in dogs, and to compare the relative accuracy of myelography and CT at localizing herniated disc material. Twenty dogs with acute intervertebral disc herniations causing paraparesis were used. The dogs were imaged using a third generation CT scanner. Based on the neurological examination, transverse scans were acquired at 3mm intervals between T10 and L4, or L3 and S3. Following the CT scans, lumbar myelograms were performed by subarachnoid injection of iohexol. Hemilaminectomies were then performed to decompress the spinal cord based on the CT and myelographic appearance. The CT scans and myelograms were randomized and 6 clinicians with differing levels of clinical experience identified the position of herniated disc material in each case. The CT and myelographic findings were compared with the surgical findings.",

Inborn errors of metabolism are caused by genetic defects resulting in abnormal synthesis, metabolism, transport or storage of biochemical compounds. In people, over 100 neurometabolic disorders have been identified, most of which are inborn errors of organic acid (OA) or amino acid (AA) metabolism. Although quantification of urinary OA is optimal for diagnosis of most metabolic disorders, determination of CSF OA and AA may be necessary for diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders involving abnormalities of CNS oxidative metabolism. Ratios of lactate to pyruvate and 3-OH butyrate to acetoacetate have been used for evaluation of the redox couple NAD\u03e9/NADH in the blood. Elevated blood alanine concentration is also an indicator of disordered pyruvate metabolism. The object of this study was to establish reference ranges for CSF OA and AA (including alanine), and CSF lactate/pyruvate and 3-OHbutyrate/acetoacetate ratios in healthy dogs under general anesthesia and 10 minutes after death.",

No significant difference was found between the OA and AA levels of the dogs under anesthesia and following euthanasia. The lactate/pyruvate ratios differed significantly from the ratios of a group of clinically normal dogs studied at the University of Georgia, and substantially from the ratios reported for canine blood. The 3-OH butyrate/acetoacetate ratios and alanine levels were not significantly different from those of the University of Georgia dogs. Therefore, 3-OH butyrate/acetoacetate ratios and alanine concentration may be more reliable than lactate/pyruvate ratios in detecting disorders of CNS metabolism in the dog. The purpose of this study is to determine if Degenerative Myelopathy (DM) of German Shepherd dogs could be caused by a defect in the gene that encodes the canine hepatic alpha (\u2423) tocopherol transfer protein (\u2423TTP). This protein is responsible for the binding and transfer of \u2423tocopherol between biological membranes and for maintaining plasma Vitamin E levels and it has been detected solely in hepatocytes. There is conflicting evidence in the literature regarding Vitamin E levels in dogs with DM; levels have been low in serum or tissue in some studies but have been normal in others. We decided to determine whether or not a genetic defect might cause impaired utilization of \u2423tocopherol in liver cells of dogs with DM, similar to that seen in humans with familial Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency (AVED). This disease is caused by defects in the human \u2423TTP gene and there are distinct similarities in clinical signs and progression to DM. The \u2423TTP mRNA is expressed at high levels in liver and at low levels in lung, retina, heart, kidney, skin and other tissues. We therefore isolated total RNA from the liver of a normal dog. The RNA was reverse transcribed and then amplified using degenerate primers. Primer selection was based on the cDNA sequences for human and rat \u2423TTP. Products were sequenced directly in both directions. We were able to identify about 600 base pairs of the 3' end of the canine \u2423TTP coding region, which represents 72 % of the whole protein. The homology of the determined amino acid sequence for canine \u2423TTP was 95 % between dog and human and 90 % between dog and rat. Almost all genetic defects causing AVED in humans lie within the region for which we now have sequence data for canine \u2423TTP. We are now conducting reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of canine \u2423TTP on liver RNA isolated from 10 dogs with histologically confirmed DM. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). However, excessive extracellular levels of glutamate are neurotoxic, and glutamate is incriminated as a mediator of secondary tissue damage following acute CNS injury. The aim of this study was to measure the concentration of glutamate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from dogs with acute and chronic compressive thoracolumbar spinal cord injuries due to intervertebral disc herniation. CSF samples were taken from the cerebellomedullary cistern (CMC) and lumbar subarachnoid space from 8 normal dogs, 13 dogs with acute spinal cord injuries and 11 dogs with chronic spinal cord compression. The samples were frozen at \u03ea80\u040aC for subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of glutamate concentration. HPLC was performed on derivatized CSF samples using ultraviolet detection. CSF glutamate concentrations in dogs with spinal cord injuries were compared with those of the normal dogs using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test.",

However, dogs with severe, acute thoracolumbar disc herniations had significantly elevated glutamate concentrations in their lumbar CSF when compared with the control dogs (p\u03fd0.01). Moreover, the severity of their clinical signs was directly related to the glutamate concentration (r s \u03ed0.6, p\u03ed0.011). Dogs with chronic compressive thoracolumbar lesions also had significantly elevated lumbar CSF glutamate concentrations when compared to the control dogs (p\u03fd0.01).

Therapeutic strategies to counter excitotoxic damage may therefore be useful in the management of such conditions and to correlate the glutamate concentration with injury severity.

Serum PTH and phosphorus concentrations returned to within the normal range in all dogs within 24 hours of the injection (the second injection in the dog that received 2). Five dogs were hypocalcemic 2-5 days post injection. One dog required transient calcium and vitamin D supplementation. No dog displayed any adverse reactions to the injections or any other side effects. All dogs were closely monitored for 6-12 months.

Total clearance, half-life, bioavailability and elimination of troglitazone by non-renal clearance mechanisms is comparable to that reported in human and animal studies. However, steadystate volume of distribution was somewhat lower in cats. PEI has been used successfully, with few adverse effects, for the treatment of people with solitary thyroid adenomas as well as for those with primary hyperparathyroidism and a variety of non-endocrine tumors. The ethanol injection causes necrosis of the tissue. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PEI for the treatment of bilateral hyperthyroidism in cats. Six cats (4 female), between the ages of 11 and 16 years (median 11 years) were included in the study. For inclusion, each cat must have met the following criteria: clinical signs typical of hyperthyroidism, increased serum total (tT4) and free T4 (fT4), bilateral thyroid enlargement demonstrated with radioactive pertechnetate scan and cervical ultrasound, no previous treatment and no concurrent illness unrelated to the hyperthyroidism. The tT4 concentrations were 3.1, 6.0, 6.9, 9.4, 9.4, 15.4 (ref. range 0.8-2.6 ) and the volume of the larger thyroid lobe in each cat was 0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, 0.2 cm 3 , respectively (normal\u03ed0.06cm 3 ). Each cat was anesthetized (15-25 min) while a 27 gauge needle was directed into both thyroid lobes (1 cat) or the larger thyroid lobe (5 cats) with ultrasound guidance. 100% ethanol was slowly injected until there was visual evidence of complete infiltration (target dose-\u00bd thyroid volume). tT4 and fT4 were monitored daily for 5 days, then every 2 weeks. Ionized calcium was also monitored daily for 5 days following the injection and results remained within the reference range. The first cat died within 12 hours of having both thyroid lobes injected, thus the remaining 5 cats had only the larger lobe treated initially. tT4 and fT4 decreased into the reference range within 72 hours post-injection in all cats. At the time of writing this report, 4 of 5 cats remain euthyroid (2 cats at 6 weeks, 1 cat at 4 weeks, 1 cat at 2 weeks). Recurrence of hyperthyroidism (T4\u03ed5.0, fT4\u03ed4.16, bilateral 99 T c uptake) occurred in one cat 2 weeks post injection. Injection of the contralateral lobe did not result in permanent euthyroidism and failure of the initial injection is suspected. Transient dysphonia (2/5 cats), Horner's Syndrome (2/5 cats) and mild gagging (2/5 cats) were noted, each sign dissipating within 2-4 weeks. A transient laryngeal paralysis that resolved after 2 weeks, was detected with ultrasound in one cat. These preliminary results suggest that staged PEI may be safe and effective for the treatment of bilateral hyperthyroidism in cats. This study describes a population of cats with a histologic diagnosis of thyroid adenomatous hyperplasia (TAH) with normal serum thyroxine concentrations and the absence of clinical hyperthyroidism.",

The data suggests that pamidronate disodium is a useful adjunct in the treatment of hypercalcemia secondary to ingestion of calcipotriene in dogs. The objective of this report is to describe the clinical syndrome seen with ingestions of calcipotriene in dogs. Data from over 50 cases of accidental canine Dovonex (calcipotriene) exposures was collected over the phone from animal owners and veterinarians. Dovonex contains 0.005% calcipotriene, a potent vitamin D 3 analogue, and is used for the treatment of psoriasis in humans. Rodent studies appear to greatly underestimate the toxicity of calcipotriene to dogs. Our data suggests that ingestions of 40-60 g calcipotriene/kg body weight or greater have resulted in severe hypercalcemia (\u03fe16 mg/dl), and calcium x phosphorus products of \u03fe130. Approximately 50% of cases developed serum calcium concentrations of \u03fe14 mg/dl, 30% had phosphorus concentrations between 7.4 and 12.3 mg/dl, and 30% had BUN concentrations between 45-148 mg/dl.

The prolonged half-life of calcipotriene necessitates monitoring and treatment for weeks. Dovonex exposure should be considered as a differential in cases of acute, severe hypercalcemia. The nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug carprofen and thyroxine (T4) are highly bound by serum proteins. We postulated that carprofen would influence thyroid fuynction tests in dogs. For this study, 21 healthy dogs, 13 males and 8 females, weighing from 14-43 kg, were treated with 2.2-3.3 mg/kg q12h of carprofen (Rimadyl) orally. Serum samples were drawn before and at 2 and 5 weeks of treatment. Serum total T4 (TT4) and TSH were measured by immunoassay. Free T4 (FT4) was measured by modified equilibrium dialysis (Nichols). The following results were obtained: Carprofen caused mild but significant depression of serum TT4 and TSH, with 4 dogs falling below the normal range (11 nM) and 3 having undetectable TSH values. Although there was a trend for FT4 to fall and FFT4 to rise, these changes were not significant. We propose the following mechanism: 1) carprofen initially displaced T4 from serum and cellular binding sites resulting in an initial elevation of FT4; 2) TSH secretion was inhibited by negative feedback; 3) T4 secretion was reduced until FT4 returned to pretreatment values. TSH remained low possibly because the pituitary intracellular FT4 remained elevated despite a normal serum FT4. In summary, dogs on carprofen therapy should ideally be assessed for hypothyroidism with FT4 by dialysis and TSH measurements.",

Thrombocytopenia is a rare but well recognized side effect of methimazole (Tapazole) treatment in cats. Methimazole has also been implicated in producing a bleeding tendency in cats with a normal platelet count. Because of that, some have recommended not using methimazole to make cats euthyroid prior to surgery, in the belief that this bleeding tendency would increase the bleeding associated with surgery and therefore surgical risk. In this study, we investigated for hemostatic abnormalities caused by the administration of methimazole to cats with hyperthyroidism. Thirteen hyperthyroid cats were evaluated before and again after 3-4 weeks after treatment with methimazole (5-15 mg/day). Parameters evaluated included serum total and free T4, platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin clotting time, and buccal mucosal bleeding time. After treatment, the median serum concentrations of total and free T4 fell to within reference range. Median platelet count was normal before treatment and increased slightly after treatment but the change was not significant; no cat became thrombocytopenic. All coagulation parameters were normal in all cats, both before treatment and after methimazole administration. The pretreatment buccal mucosal bleeding times (range, 30-90 sec) was similar to the feline reference range (60-120 sec). After treatment, buccal mucosal bleeding times tended to increase slightly (range, 45-65 sec), but the values did not rise above reference range limits and the change was not significant.",

The drug does indeed cause thrombocytopenia in a few cats and may produce an undefined bleeding tendency in other cats (even less commonly); but methimazole does not appear to induce a bleeding tendency in all cats treated. However, if a bleed tendency associated with methimazole is suspected, determination of a buccal mucosal bleeding time prior to surgery may be justified. Two commercially available L-thyroxine products (H\u03edHeska, D\u03edDaniels) were compared. Oral dosages were given at 22 ug/kg b.i.d. and IV at 10 ug/kg to 6 radio-thyroidectomized male beagles. Oral medication was given for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to obtaining samples. Repeatability of serum TT4 concentrations over a 5 day period was also determined at times 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hrs after dosing. Total thyroxine was assayed using an RIA validated for canine serum. Data analyses were performed using model independent approaches by computer (PC NonLin) and manual methods. IV kinetic analyses found T 1/2 beta (terminal T1/2) to be 19.9\u03ee8.4 hrs, Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) to be 0.44\u03ee0.11 L/kg, and total body clearance (Cl) to be 0.018\u03ee0.007 L/hr/kg. Oral kinetic analyses revealed no significant differences between H and D with the exception of Cmax (P\u03fd0.05, See table). Relative bioavailability based on AUC (H/D) was 0.87 with no significant difference found between products. Comparison of coefficient of variance for repeatability of L-thyroxine concentrations between H and D indicated no significant differences. This study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of available glucose measuring devices as commonly used in dogs. Comparisons were made between blood glucose results obtained from each device and those obtained on the same sample using a standard dry chemistry laboratory unit (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics vitros 500) as the gold standard via a simple linear regression. To estimate the difference between glucose values obtained from each device and from dry chemistry, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the median difference were calculated.",

Fasting plasma concentrations of homocysteine and vitamins B 6 , B 12 , and folate were measured in 29 cats with ATE and cardiomyopathy [ATE group; diagnosed by typical physical examination findings of ATE and either an echocardiogram (echo), necropsy, or both], 27 cats with cardiomyopathy and no history of ATE (CM group; diagnosed by echo), and 29 healthy cats (based on a normal physical examination and echo). Mean vitamin B 12 concentration was significantly lower in ATE cats (866\u03ee367 pg/ml) and CM cats (939\u03ee389 pg/ml) compared to healthy controls (1650\u03ee700 pg/ml; p\u03fd0.001). In addition, mean vitamin B 6 concentration was significantly lower in ATE cats (3247\u03ee1215 pmol/ml) and CM cats (3200\u03ee906 pmol/ml) compared to healthy cats (4380\u03ee1302 pmol/ml; p\u03ed0.005). No differences were found between groups in folate or homocysteine concentrations. There was a negative correlation between vitamins B 6 (p\u03fd0.005), B 12 (p\u03fd0.001), and folate (p\u03ed0.059) and echocardiographic left atrial size. Although homocysteine and B vitamin concentrations were not correlated with medication type or dosage, they were correlated negatively with age. Multivariate analysis revealed that vitamin B 12 concentration was the only significant predictor of left atrial size. The results of this study suggest that, although homocysteine and B vitamins do not appear to play a role in ATE, B vitamin concentrations appear to be altered in feline cardiomyopathy and may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Percutaneous occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is an established therapeutic modality in human medicine. Small case reports and abstracts have suggested that this technique is applicable in dogs with PDA. Transarterial ductal occlusion was attempted in 43 dogs between January 1994 and December 1998. Three of the dogs had undergone unsuccessful attempts at surgical correction prior to attempted occlusion. There were 36 females and 7 males with a mean age of 13\u03ee 16 months and a mean weight of 7.6 \u03ee.5.8 (range 2.1-25) kg. Following selective angiography and morphologic classification of ductal anatomy, occlusion was performed using 1-7 standard 0.038 Gianturco vascular occlusion coils (Cook Inc., Bloomington, Indiana).",

The minimal ductal diameter of the dogs that could not be occluded was significantly greater (5.4 \u03ee 2.5mm) than that of the dogs that could be occluded (2.5\u03ee 0.9mm). Additionally 4 of the 6 dogs that could not be occluded had type III ductal morphology. All three dogs which had previously undergone surgery were successfully occluded. Two dogs required a second procedure. Twenty two dogs had complete occlusion based on post-deployment angiography. The remaining 15 dogs had trivial residual flow. Complications included pulmonary embolization (4), partial aortic deployment (1), aortic embolization (4) and arterial hemmorrhage with hematoma formation (1). Coils in the pulmonary artery were left in place. All coils that embolized into the aorta were retrieved witout complication using a Nitinol gooseneck snare catheter (MicroVena, Inc). There were no fatalities. We conclude that percuatneous tranarterial ductal occlusion using Gianturco vascular occlusion coils is a viable therapy for PDA in dogs. The structure and function of the heart are determined by the interaction between the extracellular matrix (ECM), specific cell receptors (integrins), the cytoskeleton and intrinsic genetic regulation of cell function. Structurally, integrins mediate the attachment of the cardiac myocyte to the ECM and transmit the mechanical contraction force from the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Integrins also transfer mechanical and chemical information from the extracellular matrix into the cells and modulate cell phenotype-specific expression and gene transcription. We tested the hypothesis that the interaction between myocardial integrins and the ECM is altered during the ventricular remodeling which occurs in volume overload associated with mitral regurgitation.",

Increased cardiac myocyte adhesion was noted at the initiation of MR (MR-2wk) when transmural wall stress is high and collagen remodeling is most active.

Boxers are afflicted with an inherited ventricular arrhythmia (VA) that causes syncope and sudden death. The purpose of this study was to determine the morphology of spontaneous VA in Boxers using 12 lead ECGs and to compare this morphology to pace mapping in dogs of similar somatotypic conformation. A standardized 12 lead ECG was recorded from 22 Boxers with spontaneous VA. Pace mapping was performed in 7 other dogs under general anesthesia. The left ventricle (LV) was accessed via the femoral artery and the right ventricle (RV) was accessed via the femoral and jugular veins using 8.5Fr introducers. The distal two electrodes of a steerable 7Fr quadrapolar electrophysiologic catheter (1-mm interelectrode spacing) were used for pacing. The following 7 intracardiac sites were paced from the LV: apex, mid-septum, outflow tract, caudal basilar region below mitral valve; and from the RV: apex, mid-septum, and outflow tract (RVOT). The pacing cycle length was constant at 333 ms for 30 seconds. Twelve lead ECGs were recorded. The amplitude of the positive and negative deflections of the premature QRS complexes were measured in the Boxers to determine the polarity of each lead during VA. Similarly, measurements from all pacing sites in all leads were done to determine the site that most closely templated the most common morphology of the VA from the Boxers. Of the 22 VA from the Boxers, a positive QRS morphology was present in 18 (82%) dogs in the caudal leads (II, III, aVF) and 19 (86%) dogs in the left precordial leads (V2-V6). Lead I was positive in 12 (55%) and V1 was positive in 15 (68%). The terminal and delayed forces in V1 were negative in 9 of 22 (41%) dogs with positive caudal leads. The transition lead (earliest precordial lead with R/S ratio \u03fe 1) was V2 in 6 of 22 (27%) dogs and V3 in 1 dog with positive caudal leads. The paced sites that approximated the spontaneous VA were the RV mid-septum and RVOT. Circumferential pace mapping in 2 dogs did not allow further regionalization in the RVOT to the septum or free wall. In conclusion, spontaneous VA in the Boxer predominately has a positive morphology in leads that correspond to a site of origin from the basilar RV. Although specific mapping in the Boxer is required to identify the site of VA origin, these findings suggest that exploration of the basilar RV for disease is required. While elevated plasma homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia) is now recognized as an independent risk factor in human thrombovascular diseases, this has not been evaluated in cats.

By the time clinical disease occurs loss of renal functional mass may be so extensive that end-stage uremia rapidly develops. Thus, earlier indices of CRF would allow diet or other therapies to be instituted prior to generalized progression. Thirty dogs with naturally occurring CRF and 16 age-matched control dogs were evaluated as part of a two-center study. The CRF dogs were subdivided into early vs moderate CRF based on serum creatinine concentrations (Cr) and glomerular filtration rates (GFR). Sera and free-catch urine samples were obtained after withholding food overnight. Serum biochemistry profiles, concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitriol, and urine concentrations of microprotein, creatinine, and eicosanoids (PGE 2 and TxB 2 ), were analyzed. Comparisons were performed using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA at p\u03fd0.05. Calcitriol and albumin concentrations were not significantly different in any group. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and PTH concentrations were different only between control and moderate CRF dogs. However, urine PGE 2 /Creatinine, (PG/Cr) urine protein/creatinine (Pr/Cr) ratios, and BUN were different from controls in both CRF dog groups. Most notable was a \u03fe4-fold decrease in urine PG/Cr in affected dogs in both the mild (1084 pg/mg)and moderate (666 pg/mg) CRF groups (control\u03ed4374 pg/mg). Regression analysis indicated strong inverse correlation (r 2 \u03ed0.54, p\u03fd0.0001)between log(urine PG/Cr) and Cr. An inverse correlation between log(GFR) and Cr and direct relationship between log(urine PG/Cr) and GFR were also found. Correlations with BUN or urine Pr/Cr were not strong due to high variability. Strong correlation between urine PG/Cr and dogs with early CRF along with large numerical differences between normal and affected dogs suggests this measurement may help identify geriatric and canine populations with early CRF. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that cats with partial nephrectomy exhibit glomerular hypertension (Am J Physiol 269:R1008, 1995), an adaptive change that has been associated with progressive renal injury in laboratory rodents and dogs. In human beings (N Engl J Med 334:939, 1996) , laboratory rodents (J Clin Invest 77:1993 , 1986 , and diabetic dogs (Kidney Int 46:161, 1994) , a renoprotective effect of inhibition of converting enzyme has been causally linked to reductions in glomerular capillary pressure. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, benazepril, would lower glomerular capillary pressure in cats with induced chronic renal insufficiency.",

We conclude that benazepril treatment reduced glomerular capillary pressure and systemic arterial blood pressure while sustaining or increasing renal plasma flow and GFR in cats with chronic renal insufficiency. A blinded, multicenter, prospective clinical trial assessed the effects of enalapril (EN) versus standard care in dogs with naturally occurring, idiopathic glomerulonephropathy (GN). Twenty-nine adult dogs with membranous (16) and membranoproliferative (13) GN were identified for study.

These results suggest that EN treatment is beneficial in dogs with naturally occurring idiopathic GN. Systemic arterial hypertension is thought to be a common complicating factor in feline chronic renal failure (CRF). If this is translated into glomerular capillary hypertension, it may contribute to progressive loss of functioning nephrons. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of hypertension in cases of feline CRF and to compare urine protein excretion in hypertensive and normotensive cats with similar degrees of renal dysfunction.",

The high osmolality of normal feline urine is an important defence mechanism preventing bacterial colonization of the urinary tract.

Four adult cats with ADPKD and four age-matched, healthy control cats were studied. All cats were instrumented with a radiotelemetry device for 24-hour hemodynamic monitoring. Renal function was assessed by measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), renal blood flow (RBF), filtration fraction (FF), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr). GFR was determined by 3H inulin clearance and RBF by 14C-tetraethylammonium bromide clearance. Plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (Aldo), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured. All evaluations were performed at baseline and repeated after 7 days of amlodipine therapy at a dose of 0.625mg/cat.

However, some animals with normal or mildly elevated blood pressure may develop higher pressure values. Sustained hypertension (\u03fe180 mmHg) is common in dogs with CRF and may lead to important clinical consequences. Clinical recognition of hypertension in CRF is important as SHT appears to significantly decrease survival time in CRF patients. A double blind, crossover, placebo controlled study was done in intact adult dogs (n\u03ed8) to determine if SAMe, an important methyl and GSH donor, can attenuate adverse effects of high dose chronic prednisone (Pred) therapy. A pilot study in 4 adult dogs, determined that co-administration of Pred (1-3 mg/ kg/ day) and SAMe (20 mg/kg/day minimum dose) did not affect bioavailability or pharmacokinetics of either substance (24 hrs, 21 to 42 days).",

We examined the medical records of in 14 dogs with ultrasonographically identified gallbladder (GB) mucoceles and recorded the clinical, biochemical and histological findings and treatment outcome. In all dogs abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged GB with either a kiwi or stellate like bile pattern. Eight breeds were represented with an increased incidence in Cocker Spaniels (4/14). Body weight and age ranged from 6 to 36 kg (median:12 kg) and 4 to 17 years (median: 9.5 yrs), respectively. Clinical signs included: vomiting (12/14), anorexia (11/14), lethargy (9/14), polyuria/polydipsia (5/14), diarrhea (2/14) and a history of diabetes mellitus (2/14). Physical exam findings included: abdominal pain (6/13), icterus (6/13), hyperthermia (4/13) and a palpable abdominal mass (1/13). Serum biochemical evaluation showed increased alkaline phosphatase (13/14, median 11.6X, range 1-55X), alanine aminotransferase (11/14, median 6.5X, range 1-101X), \u2425-glutamyl transpeptidase (11/13, median 4.7X, range 1-66.7X) and bilirubin (11/13, median 7.6X, range 1-74X). GB histopathology in 10/14 dogs confirmed the presence of a mucocele and identified mucosal hyperplasia (10/10), mural necrosis (9/10) and suppurative cholecystitis (5/10). Three dogs without GB biopsies had macroscopic evidence of a mucocele and GB wall necrosis. Surgery was done in 10 dogs (9 cholecystectomies and 1 cholecystotomy). Acute GB rupture was identified in 3 dogs and a previous rupture suspected in 4 dogs on histopathology and/or by the presence of GB wall adhesions at surgery. Aerobic bacterial cultures of bile were positive in 6/ 9 dogs. Four dogs died in the immediate post-operative period from bile peritonitis (2), pneumonia(1) and an unrelated cardiomyopathy (1). The other 6 dogs were alive and well at least 2 months post-operatively. Two dogs died of GB rupture pior to surgical intervention. One dog was euthanized due to chronic renal failure. One dog treated medically (choleretics and antibiotics) was asymptomatic for 1 year. Identification of the characteristic kiwi or stellate pattern to bile in the GB accurately identified the presence of a GB mucocele. In dogs with biochemical evidence of hepatobiliary disease, GB mucoceles were frequently associated with mural necrosis (12/13) and/or cholecystitis (9/13). These findings suggest that when GB mucoceles are identified by ultrasound, a combination of surgery (cholecystectomy) and medical treatment (antibiotics) should be contemplated. Fine needle aspiration with cytology has been frequently advocated as a diagnostic tool for the evaluation of liver disease. The correlation of cytology to histopathology, however has not been evaluated in dogs and cats with liver disease. This retrospective study was performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic cytology when compared to the histologic diagnosis.",

The greatest correlation was observed in cases of hepatic neoplasia (44%). Unexpected hepatotoxicity was associated with the administration of stanozolol (Winstrol-V; 1-4 mg/cat/day PO) in 16/21 cats enrolled in two separate studies. One study was evaluating the effects of stanozolol in a colony of 18 research cats (12 healthy, 6 with naturally occurring chronic renal failure), and the other study was evaluating the clinical response of client-owned cats with severe gingivitis/stomatitis to stanozolol. The cats in the chronic renal failure study (RF) were divided into two groups and received stanozolol (25 mg IM on day one, followed by 2 mg stanozolol PO q12h) or placebo for four weeks, followed by a two-week washout period, after which the groups were reversed. In the gingivitis-stomatitis study (GS), cats were administered 1 mg stanozolol PO q24h. Most cats in the RF study stopped eating or had a significantly reduced food intake within 7-10 days of initiating stanozolol administration. Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was significantly elevated in 14/18 RF cats when tested during and up to two weeks after stanozolol administration. Serum alkaline phosphatase activity (SAP) was mildly increased in only 3 cats. Four cats in the RF study had ALT \u03fe1000 U/L after only two weeks of stanozolol administration and were removed from the study. All 4 of these cats had coagulopathies consistent with vitamin-K antagonism, and 3 were hyperbilirubinemic. Administration of vitamin K resolved the coagulopathy in 3 cats within 48 hours. All cats survived and liver enzymes were normal in all cats tested more than 4 weeks after discontinuing stanozolol. In the GS cats, 2/3 developed evidence of severe hepatic failure 2-3 months after initiating stanozolol therapy. Anorexia was present for one week and one month, respectively, when the cats presented for reevaluation. Both cats were hyperbilirubinemic, and coagulopathies were present in both. Serum ALT was elevated in one cat, but normal in the other. SAP was elevated in both cats. The cat with the most severe hyperbilirubinemia did not survive. Histopathologic evaluation of liver biopsies from 3 cats in the RF study and both cats in the GS study demonstrated severe, diffuse, centrilobular hepatic lipidosis and cholestasis, without evidence of significant hepatocellular necrosis. The use of stanozolol in cats is not recommended until additional toxicity studies can be performed.",

In response to a single cryo infusion (12 UvWF/ kg), plasma vWF:Ag peaked at \u00bd h., and returned to baseline at 24 h. post infusion. Shortening of BT was readily demonstrated in type 1 and 2 vWD dogs at a dosage range of 5.6 to 11.5 UvWF/kg. Transfusion of up to 22 UvWF/kg did not shorten BT in type 3 vWD dogs. Preoperative dosages of 14 to 30 UvWF/ kg induced plasma vWF:Ag response of 19 to 63%, sufficient for normal intraoperative hemostasis in all dogs. Postoperative transfusion to sustain plasma vWF:Ag \u054610% maintained hemostasis for 48 hr post-op. In most cases, dosages of 5.5 to 9 UvWF/kg were sufficient to stop cutaneous or mucosal bleeds. No adverse reactions were observed after cryo transfusion. These studies indicate that cryo is safe and highly effective for treating vWD. The BT is useful for diagnosis but does not accurately predict surgical hemostasis, and BT response differs for vWD subtypes. Optimizing treatment regimens to balance cost and efficacy will require specific measurement of vWF to determine cryo potency and patient response.

The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical features of cats with well differentiated lymphocytic gastrointestinal lymphoma, and to determine response to therapy and prognostic factors. Sixty-five cats with gastrointestinal lymphoma were evaluated at the Veterinary Specialty Hospital of San Diego (VSHSD) between 1988 and 1996. Of these, 39 cats were determined to have well differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma. Cats with a histologic diagnosis with biopsy obtained endoscopically (97%) or surgically (3%) were considered for study. All biopsies were reviewed by a single pathologist (JLC). The most common clinical signs were vomiting (87%), weight loss (79%), anorexia (53%), diarrhea (53%), and lethargy (47%). Nine percent had neither vomiting nor diarrhea. An abdominal mass was palpated in 26% of cats while 32% had thickened gastrointestinal loops. Twenty-six cats were treated, 23 of whom were given prednisone and chlorambucil. Fourteen (61%) achieved complete remission (CR). The disease-free interval (DFI) of those who achieved CR ranged from 5.75 to 24 months (median 15.5 months, 6 cats still in CR). The overall survival ranged from 0.33 to 25 months (median 12 months), and the median survival of those who achieved CR was 17.5 months. There was no significant difference in DFI or survival due to age, sex, breed, palpable abdominal mass, retroviral status, hypoalbuminemia, or localization of tumor. In conclusion, cats with well differentiated lymphocytic gastrointestinal lymphoma treated with a relatively simple protocol have a higher CR rate and overall survival times than in cats previously reported with poorly differentiated gastrointestinal lymphoma treated with more complex protocols. Endoscopic biopsy was highly useful for obtaining a diagnosis, and may result in early detection of gastrointestinal lymphoma in cats. Due to the limited accessibility of the nervous system, the treatment of brain tumors via gene therapy offers unique possibilities. Previous studies using stereotactic injections of viral vectors only induced focal transduction. Since viral particle size permits blood brain barrier passage, we hypothesized that delivery of an adenoviral vector by selective arterial catherization would permit significant tumor transduction in vivo with minimal side effects to the patient.",

Alterations in cisplatin accumulation in cells resulting in resistance is multifactorial. A decrease in drug influx, an increase drug efflux, or modifications in ion transport mechanisms have been observed in cisplatin resistant cell lines by others. The objective of research was to investigate the HCO 3 \u03ea /Cl \u03ea exchange inhibitor SITS (4-acetamido-4\u0408; isothiocyanostilbene-2,2\u0408-disulfonic acid). Our hypothesis to be tested was that a high intracellular chloride ion concentration (via SITS exposure) lowers the concentration of the cytotoxic aquated cisplatin species resulting in cisplatin resistance. Using a canine osteosarcoma cell line established in our laboratory, we exposed cells to cisplatin with or without concomitant exposure to SITS. Cell survival was determined using the Cell Titer 96 AQ ueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay. In COS31 cisplatin sensitive cells cultured in the presence of SITS in chloride-containing medium, sensitivity to cisplatin significantly decreased after only one exposure to cisplatin. At fixed concentrations of cisplatin, sensitivity to cisplatin significantly decreased as the concentration of SITS exposure increased. Cisplatin undergoes activation to its toxic form when the chloride ligands are replaced by water, thereby forming a charged electrophile, which reacts with DNA and other nucleophilic sites. It has been proposed that a high extracellular chloride concentration favors the native form of cisplatin and a low chloride concentration within the cell shifts the equilibrium to the aquated cytotoxic form of cisplatin. The data presented indicates that inhibiting HCO 3 -/Clexchange with SITS leads to a dose-dependent form of cisplatin resistance. Our laboratory findings would suggest that the level of one ion or inhibiting an ion transport system could lead to a cascade of effects within the cell, which may ultimately lead to drug resistance.",

L-asparaginase is an enzyme that inhibits protein synthesis by the depletion of sources of L-asparagine, which is necessary for transformed lymphoid cells to proliferate. Canine lymphoma is a predominantly B-cell tumor with widespread disease; without treatment, dogs with lymphoma usually survive 1-2 months. Previously untreated dogs with lymphoma will respond to L-asparaginase therapy. A prospective study evaluated the use of L-asparaginase as single agent therapy in dogs with lymphoma that relapsed following single agent Adriamycin chemotherapy (30 mg/m 2 , five 3 week cycles). Dogs were given 10,000 IU/m 2 (5,000 IU/ml) as an intramuscular injection 15 minutes following premedication (Benadryl, 1 mg/kg) once every 4 weeks. Dogs achieving either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) following treatment initiation were continued on L-asparaginase every 4 weeks thereafter until relapse. Eighteen dogs were treated. Eleven dogs (61.1%) achieved a complete remission (CR) with a median time to relapse of 24 weeks, four dogs (22.2%) achieved a partial remission (PR) with a median time to progressive disease (PD) of 6 weeks, and three dogs (16.7%) did not respond (NR) to therapy. The asparaginase was well tolerated and no toxicoses were observed (allergic reactions, urticarial reactions). Others have reported that more than 90% of dogs with previously untreated lymphoma achieve a CR or PR with L-asparaginase therapy with a median time to relapse of 30 weeks. In our study, 83.3% achieved a CR or PR using Lasparaginase therapy with an overall median time to relapse of 21 weeks. We concluded that single agent L-asparaginase should be considered in the treatment of dogs with relapsing lymphoma. The major cause of treatment failure in cancer patients is tumour invasion and metastasis. The inability of local therapy to eradicate metastatic cancer presents a challenge in the therapy of residual or metastatic disease. Laser immunotherapy is a novel cancer treatment utilizing local selective chromophore-enhanced photothermal laser treatment to reduce tumour burden and expose tumour antigens while the immunoadjuvant concomitantly stimulates a systemic anti-tumour immune response against the remaining cells of the tumour. Laser immunotherapy employs: (1) an infrared laser (805 nm); (2) a photosensitizer (indocyanine green [ICG]); and (3) an immunoadjuvant (glycated chitosan gel [GCG] ). The purpose of this study was to investigate immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic cancer (e.g. feline vaccinosarcoma) utilizing the Dunning R3327-MatLu rat prostatic cancer model. Twenty-five (3 groups) Copenhagen rats were injected subcutaneously in the left flank with 10 6 MatLu cells. Laser immunotherapy was performed on day 13 (Group I \u03ed early) or on day 33 (Group II \u03edlate) with intratumour injection (200 L) of the photosensitizer (0.25% ICG) and immunoadjuvant (1% GCG) solution followed by noninvasive laser irradiation (10 minutes at 2W).

In 6 cats, PT and PTT were measured and were elevated in 2 and 6 cats, respectively. Antithrombin III was low in the 1 cat in which it was measured. Thoracic radiographs were available for review in 14 cats and common findings included pleural effusion (8), uneven vascular diameter between lung lobes (7), noncircumscribed pulmonary consolidations (6), enlargement and blunting of caudal pulmonary arteries (5), oligemia in the periphery of 1 or more lung lobes (4), atelectasis (3), and single well-demarcated thoracic masses (3). One cat had a normal thoracic radiograph. PTE was suspected antemortem in only 4 cats. Histologic lesions were classified according to the location of the thrombus (venous, 8; capillary, 9; arterial, 20) ; distribution (focal, 6; multifocal, 14; diffuse, 9); and chronicity (peracute, 1; acute, 13; subacute, 7; chronic, 8). Underlying conditions identified at necropsy included cardiac disease (18), neoplasia (10), DIC (5), protein-losing enteropathy (4), protein-losing nephropathy (4) , IMHA (2), sepsis (2), and trauma (1). Two cats had long term (\u03fe30 days) dialysis catheters placed and in both, blood clots were visualized antemortem at the tip of the catheter or in the right atrium. Diseases that may have predisposed cats to developing PTE were identified in 14 cats (47%). PTE was the direct cause of death in 4 cats, a contributor to death in 17 cats, and an incidental finding in 8 cats. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) are inflammatory mediators derived from the lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid. LTC4 and LTD4 within the lung can increase mucous secretion, increase vascular permeability, impair mucociliary clearance, and cause bronchoconstriction. Leukotrienes have been suggested to be important mediators in many forms of bronchial asthma in people. Agents that inhibit lipoxygenase or block the leukotriene receptors have been recently added to the therapeutic options available for human asthmatics. LTE4 is the stable end product of both LTC4 and LTD4 metabolism. LTE4 is excreted in the urine and urine levels may be used as an indicator of lipoxygenase activity in the patient. The potential ex vivo generation of mediators in urine samples from urinary tract disease patients remains a poorly defined area. Studies in people have revealed substantially elevated urinary LTE4 levels in many types of asthmatic patients. A report of urinary LTE4 levels in a feline model has noted a 2-3 fold increase in urinary LTE4 following the induction of allergic bronchitis.",

Urine samples were collected via cystocentesis from cats with the clinical diagnosis of bronchitis (n\u03ed16), LUTD in the form of urinary tract infection or cystic calculi (n\u03ed6), and normal cats (n\u03ed4). Urinary LTE4 levels (pg/ml) were determined by use of a commercially available ELISA assay (Oxford Biomedical Research, Inc., Oxford, MI). Urinary LTE4 levels are referenced to urine creatinine concentration (mg/ml) measured using a modified kinetic Jaffe method. Mean urinary LTE4/creatinine (pg/mg) ratios (mean\u03eeSD) for the bronchitic, normal, and LUTD-afflicted populations were 31.5 \u03ee 53.9, 33.8 \u03ee 13.5, and 57.7 \u03ee 98.9 respectively. No statistically significant difference (p\u03fd0.05) between the means was present. Our results suggest that the pathophysiology of feline allergic bronchitis may differ from human asthma and experimentally-induced feline eosinophilic lower airway disease in the degree of lipoxygenase activity contributing to clinical signs. Further study appears warranted before anti-leukotriene therapies could be recommended for treatment of this condition in cats.",

In conclusion, BWBP derived variables effectively characterized lower airway obstruction and its immediate reversal by treatment with a beta-2 agonist. Using BWBP, a rapid diagnosis of lower airway obstruction and its subsequent reversal may be made in cats with asthma.

This study determined MCCR in normal anesthetized cats and found that it was not influenced by the administration of theophylline. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in dogs is generally performed through a bronchoscope, limiting accessibility to clinicians with specialized equipment. To increase availability of this procedure, a non-bronchoscopic technique was developed. A 122 cm, 16 FR Levin type polyvinyl stomach tube (Sherwood Medical Co., St. Louis, MO) was modified using sterile technique. The distal fenestrations were cut off and the end tapered. The proximal end was shortened by 40-55 cm. Nine dogs (9-26kg) were anesthetized by injection, placed in dorsal recumbency, and intubated. The BAL tube was passed through the tracheal tube into the airways until resistance was felt, then slightly retracted, rotated, and readvanced to insure a snug fit. Radiographs showed the tube to be in the right (7/ 9) or left (2/9) caudal lobe. A 25 ml bolus of saline was infused by syringe, followed by 5 ml of air. Suction was applied immediately using the same syringe. This procedure was repeated 4 times for a total volume of 125 ml. Fluid retrieved from boluses 2&3 and 4&5 were combined for analysis. Oxygen was provided for 10 min following BAL. Oxygen saturation was measured by pulse oximetry 1,3,5,10,15, and 20 min post-BAL. Thoracic radiographs were taken 48 hr post-BAL.",

Affected cats were identified by a computer search of the NYSCVM database, using the hospital's diagnostic codes for the following conditions: pulmonary thromboembolism, lung infarction due to thrombosis, thrombosis of the pulmonary artery, and lung thrombosis. Twenty-eight cases were identified using these search parameters; of these, 17 cases were suitable for inclusion in the study. No sex predilection for was detected in affected cats (47% male vs. 53% female). The median age at the time of death was 11 years (range 10 months to 18 years; n\u03ed15). However, the age distribution was bimodal (peaks centered at 0-2 and 10-12 years of age). The median body weight was 3.8 kg. (range 2.3 to 5.2 kg.; n\u03ed15). PTE occurred in association with another disorder in most cats (95%). In \u03f375% of cases, PTE was associated with a common feline disorder: neoplasm (n\u03ed6), pancreatitis (n\u03ed2), anemia (n\u03ed2), cardiac disease (n\u03ed1), FIP (n\u03ed1), and hepatic lipidosis (n\u03ed1). Other disorders associated with PTE included: glomerular nephritis, pneumonia, and encephalitis. Respiratory distress that immediately preceded death was recorded in the medical record of 63% of cats with PTE. In cats with primary cardiac or pulmonary disease and in anemic cats, respiratory distress was usually attributed to progression of the known pathology; in the remaining cats that had dyspnea, the onset of respiratory distress was generally attributed to the complications of severe multisystemic illness. However, PTE was not suspected as the cause of dyspnea in any of the cats included in this study. In those cats with confirmed PTE but without significant cardiac or pulmonary disease, the clinical signs of PTE were similar to those reported for other species: an acute onset of tachypnea and dyspnea which fails to improve with oxygen therapy. Thoracic radiographs were normal or had non-specific changes such as prominent interstitial and alveolar markings, pulmonary edema, and vascular changes. We conclude that PTE occurs in the cat but is rare. In this study, PTE was found in association with a variety of common feline disorders and complicated the clinical management and, in some instances, directly caused the death of affected cats. It appears from the findings outlined here that the same criteria used to raise the clinical suspicion for PTE in the dog can also be applied to the cat.",

A high energy density level in the food has also been described as a factor predisposing to obesity in humans and laboratory animals. This study was conducted to compare the effects of dietary fat and energy density of the diet on body weight (BW) and body composition changes following gonadectomy in cats compared to intact controls.",

Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) concerns cholesterol movements from peripheral cells via plasma towards the liver, the only organ in which elimination of cholesterol from the body is possible, by transformation into biliary acids. RCT is initiated by efflux of unesterified cholesterol from cells into HDL (containing apolipoprotein A-I) following by esterification in these lipoproteins (LP). Movements towards the liver involve two possible mechanisms: direct uptake of HDL (or HDL cholesteryl esters) and/or cholesteryl esters, or exchanges with VLDL and LDL (containing apolipoprotein B100) and uptake by the liver of these LP.

Diets containing 20 carbon n-3 fatty acids increase membrane fluidity even at a P/S ratio of 1.0. It is not the dietary P/S ratio or total PUFA, but rather the contribution of long chain n-3 fatty acids, which increases membrane fluidity and improve phagocytosis.

The LSO group also had significant, but to a lesser degree, incorporation of 20:5 and 22:5, but no 22:6 was observed. We conclude that 18 and 20 carbon n-3 fatty acid are differentially incorporated into the cell membrane at the same n-6/n-3 ratio, resulting in a differential reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators. Thus, it is the type (18 vs. 20 carbon) and amount of n-3 fatty acids and not simply the n-6/n-3 ratio that differentially modifies membrane composition and cellular function.

This pilot study was conducted to determine if insoluble dietary fiber had an effect on fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and if the presence of fiber altered fecal nitrogen excretion. Twelve neutered, healthy, adult, mixed breed cats were allocated into 2 dietary groups of 6 cats, fed individually in a randomized cross-over design. Cats were provided food based on individual caloric needs for weight maintenance. Body weight was monitored weekly and food consumption was recorded daily. Initially all cats were fed a maintanence diet (MD) (1% fiber) for 2 weeks, then cats were divided into the test groups and fed either a moderate fiber (MF) diet (9% insoluble fiber) or a high fiber (HF) diet (17% insoluble fiber) for 2 weeks. At the end of each period, feces were collected for 48 hr to determine fecal output, and after this, fecal samples were collected immediately upon defecation, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u03ea80\u040aC until analyzed. Samples were extracted and analyzed for SCFA concentration by gas chromatography. Total fecal nitrogen was determined by the Leco Analysis System after converting the samples to vapor in a high temperature oven. The cats consumed all diets readily and maintained their body weights throughout the study. Cats consuming the MF & HF diets had significantly higher concentrations of acetate and propionate, but not butyrate or total SCFA than cats consuming MD. No differences were found between MF & HF, although cats consuming the HF diet tended to have a higher SCFA conc. As expected, cats consuming the HF diets also produced the most feces (P \u03fd 0.05) compared to the MF or MD cats. Fecal nitrogen (FN) values increased (P \u03fd 0.05) in the cats consuming diets containing more insoluble fiber, but were not significantly different between the MF and HF diets. The increase in FN correlated with: 1) the increase in fecal dry weight (p \u03ed 0.009, r \u03ed 0.472), 2) the total SCFA concentrations (p \u03ed 0.0039, r\u03ed 0.417), and 3) the dietary protein concentration (p \u03ed 0.0026, r \u03ed 0.434). These data support previous in vitro work showing that the colonic microflora in cats can ferment insoluble fiber to SCFA, which may influence colonic health. Further, increased nitrogen in the feces of cats consuming insoluble fiber is important, because it may suggest reduced dietary protein digestibility. Alternatively, increased FN excretion could be due to the increased SCFA (and concurrent production of hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and water) that ''traps'' ammonia in the feces as ammonium ion. Each year a number of dogs participating in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race develop myopathies. The objective of this study was to determine the role of vitamin E in limiting the extent of this muscle damage by investigating the hypothesis that dogs with higher prerace plasma vitamin E concentrations would perform better and experience less muscle damage than dogs with lower vitamin E concentrations.",

Total VFA concentrations and the distribution of individual VFAs in the proximal and distal colon were comparable to those reported in the forestomach of ruminants and in the large intestines of other animals. Small intestinal VFA concentrations in the cats were higher than those found in other species; this is consistent with recent reports that normal cats harbor high numbers of small intestinal bacteria. Luminal pH varied throughout the intestines of the cats in a pattern similar to that reported in other species. Although VFA concentrations in the cats were high, the total VFA amounts were very low due to the small gastrointestinal tract volume, and little metabolic energy is probably provided by VFAs in cats. VFAs are likely to have local beneficial effects, however, as reported in other species. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) refers to a group of isomers of linoleic acid. In growing mice, rats, and chickens, consumption of CLA decreases body fat content 57-70%, 23%, and 22%, respectively. CLA supplementation to adult mice resulted in significantly less body fat (\u03ea46%) and more lean body mass (\u03e99%) when compared with non-supplemented mice. Therefore, CLA may be useful in weight reduction programs in cats or dogs. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the influence of CLA supplementation on body composition in healthy adult cats.",

            "text": "DISCUSSION CLA consumption by healthy adult cats did not apparently influence body composition. Several possible explanations exist. Cats have decreased delta-6-desaturase activity; therefore, they may metabolize CLA differently from other species. Adult cats were studied, and CLA consumption may influence body composition to a greater degree in growing animals. It is possible that consumption of a greater quantity of CLA or a longer study period may have resulted in changes in body composition. Lastly, a difference may have been observed if a greater number of cats had been studied. CONCLUSION Although CLA consumption by rats, mice, chickens, and human beings is associated with alteration in body composition (less adipose tissue and greater lean body mass), it did not influence body composition in these healthy adult cats. Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) DNA has been detected in the majority of sarcoids examined to date. These studies have focused on cases located primarily in the Northeast region of the United States, and Europe (primarily Switzerland). The majority of tumors in these studies have bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) DNA found in them with a much smaller percentage having BPV-2 type DNA. In all studies to date viral DNA was detected in tumor tissue alone, and was absent from normal equine skin and other tissues tested.",

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen equine tissue samples for the presence of viral DNA. One hundred fifty four tissue samples from 60 horses were collected and analyzed for the presence of BPV-1 or BPV-2. Tissue samples were collected from tumors (sarcoids) and from normal skin at close and distant proximity to the tumor sites. Tissues were harvested, immediately fixed in 10% formaldehyde routinely processed and paraffin embedded. A 50-micron section was used for DNA extraction. Primers known to amplify a 280 base pair region of the E5 early gene of both BPV-1 and BPV-2 were used to detect viral DNA. Restriction enzyme cleavage patterns of the amplified fragment was then performed to determine papillomavirus types. Negative controls included three equine warts, skin from three unaffected horses, a cutaneous melanoma, cutaneous lymphoma, and a cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, swabs were taken of the skin of one affected horse to determine if viral shedding from the tumor site could contaminate the surface of normal skin. A bovine fibropapilloma was used as a positive control. 91 out of 98 equine sarcoids were positive for bovine papillomaviral DNA. 7 of the positive samples were sequenced and shown to match 100% with expected sequence patterns for BPV-1 and BPV-2. Approximately 50% of the tumors examined in this study had restriction enzyme patterns consistent with BPV-2. Twenty-nine of the 43 samples of normal skin taken from affected horses were positive for papillomavirus DNA.",

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a clinically important disease in both humans and domestic cats, manifested by cardiac hypertrophy and myocyte disarray which can result in heart failure and sudden death. The disease is familial in humans, resulting from mutations in genes that determine the structure and function of cardiac contractile proteins. Recent observations indicate that HCM in the cat is also familial, supporting the hypothesis that human and feline HCM share related molecular pathogenesis. We propose to test this hypothesis using complementary mutation screening of candidate genes and gene mapping approaches.

Mild lesions may not compromise quality of life or longevity, but moderate to severe lesions often lead to syncope, exertional weakness, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.

            "text": "This study documents the progressive nature of SAS in some Newfoundlands during the first year of life. The degree of disease progression is sufficient in some dogs to affect prognosis and therapeutic decisions. The syndrome of gastric distention and volvulus (GDV) occurs commonly in large breed dogs and may prove fatal in approximately 20% of cases. Approximately 43% of these cases develop cardiac arrhythmias that may contribute to mortality. Most of these arrhythmias are ventricular in origin and ventricular fibrillation (VF) may be the mechanism of death. This study designed an iatrogenic model of gastric distention (GD) to investigate (1) the prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) during acute GD and its recovery, (2) if programmed electrical stimulation (PES) may uncover tendency to VF, (3) if the QTc of the electrocardiogram (ECG) predicts tendency to VF, and (4) if hemodynamic changes predate VF. Eleven healthy beagles, anesthetized with morphine and alpha-chloralose, and instrumented so that vascular pressures, cardiac output, and PES could be recorded, were used. Five were unperturbed, while acute gastric distention to a pressure of 30mmHg for 1.5 hours was produced in six others. The results were (1) No dogs with GD developed spontaneously occurring arrhythmias. (2) Ventricular fibrillation was produced in no dogs by conventional PES, but in all dogs (p\u03fd0.05) with GD and none of the controls, using accelerated ventricular pacing. (3) The QTc of the ECG did not change in dogs with GD, but it shortened in (p\u03fd0.05) in controls. (4) There were no hemodynamic changes that achieved statistical significance. In conclusion, dogs with acute GD have a tendency for VF which may be uncovered by a robust protocol of PES. There are no hemodynamic prodromata of VF. Future studies will be conducted using various specific autonomic probes to determine the putative mechanism for the vulnerability to arrhythmia with GD. Arterial thromboembolism is a common sequalae to cardiomyopathy in cats. A safe and effective method to prevent thrombus formation and subsequent embolization does not currently exist. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has been used in humans as long-term prophalaxis for individuals at risk of thromboembolic conditions. The purpose of this study was to document the effects of dalteparin sodium (Fragmin) on laboratory values in cats. In humans, the therapeutic range for anti-Xa is 0.3-0.7 IU/ml. Eight healthy cats were studied. Cats were divided into two groups randomly. Each cat had a normal physical examination and a CBC, platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and anti-Xa activity prior to study admission. Group 1 received a single subcutaneous injection of dalteparin sodium at 200 IU/kg once daily for 5 days, while Group 2 received 100 IU/kg once daily for 5 days. Blood samples were collected for analysis prior to study admission and then 4 hours after the final dose on the fifth day. One cat in Group 2 had additional samples for anti-Xa activity at 2, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-injection. Samples were processed using routine laboratory methods. Values were compared using a t-test with a p value of \u03fd0.05 considered significant.",

No clear association between change in CK and hormonal supplement was apparent in the 5 TB or 2 ER susceptible horses apart from a tendency to lower CK with estradiol in normal horses. Muscle glycogen concentrations on the hay-only diet were unaffected by estradiol supplementation but mean concentrations were 50-60 mg/ kg dw lower at all time points with progesterone supplementation.

The Syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) is a rare disorder in dogs characterised by hypo-osmolality and persistent arginine vasopressin (AVP) production, in the absence of hypovolemia and/or hypotension. Polydipsia is the presenting clinical sign common to all previously reported cases of canine SIADH.

Under physiologic conditions, a rise in intracellular free calcium ([Ca 2\u03e9 ] i ) is the trigger for insulin release from pancreatic \u2424 cells. Norepinephrine (NE), a potent inhibitor of insulin release, acts in part by lowering [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i . We investigated the mechanisms by which NE lowers [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i using indo-1 microfluorimetry to measure [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i in single HIT-T15 cells, a hamster-derived \u2424 cell line. The possibility that NE directly inhibits calcium influx via voltage-dependent Ca 2\u03e9 channels (VDCC) was tested using a depolarizing concentration of potassium chloride (KCL) to open VDCC. We found no effect of NE (10M) on [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i in the presence of 35 or 20 mM KCL or in cells depolarized by the incremental addition of 3 to 5 mM KCL. In the event that NE interacts with VDCC only in the presence of glucose (GLU), we depolarized cells using 20 mM KCL in the presence of diazoxide (DIAZ) and 10 mM GLU. Again, NE had no effect on [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i . We next examined the possibility that NE lowers [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i by direct activation of KATP channels.

Over 50% of TgAA positive samples were from dogs \u03fd\u03ed5 years of age while it took until 8 years of age to obtain \u03fe50% of samples from dogs with idiopathic hypothyroidism. This supports the hypothesis that idiopathic hypothyroidism may be a sequelae of autoimmune thyroiditis. Eight breeds with significantly higher ( This study was undertaken to 1) identify clinical signs associated with subclinical thyroiditis (SCThyr; normal T4 and TSH with thyroid hormone antibody (THAA)) and subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHypoT4; normal T4, increased TSH), 2) assess the effect of THAA status on the clinical presentation of hypothyroidism (HypoT4) and 3) evaluate some signs which often initiate thyroid investigation. The lab records of 58,322 cases in which clinicians had checked at least one of 32 pre-printed clinical signs on the request form were reviewed. These were categorized based on T4, TSH and THAA results into: healthy (Norm); antibody positive (\u03e9ve) and negative (\u03eave) HypoT4; SCThyr; \u03e9ve-SCHypoT4 and \u03eaveSCHypoT4. Chi-square analysis compared rates of each sign to its reference in the Norm group. A p-value of 0.05 inferred statistical significance and odds ratios of \u03fe 1.10 or \u03fd 0.91 arbitrarily inferred biological significance. In the SCThyr group, obesity was more common than in Norm cases, but crusts, dermatitis-moist, dermatitis-erythema, hyper-pigmentation, lichenification, pyoderma, papule and pruritis were under-represented. Lethargy was more frequent in both SCHypoT4 groups but \u03e9veSCHypoT4 had less pruritis, otitis, pyoderma, crusts, and seizures and more obesity and diarrhea, than Norm dogs. The -veSCHypoT4 group had more hyperpigmentation, seborrhea, crusts, hyperkeratosis, lichenification and acanthosis. Comparison between the two HypoT4 groups indicated more obesity and lethargy in the \u03e9ve group but less abrasions, acanthosis, crusts, dermatitis-moist, dermatitis-erythema, hyperkeratosis, infertility, lichenification, polydipsia, polyuria, pyoderma, pruritis, seborrhea and weight loss. Between the two SCHypoT4 groups there was more obesity, lethargy and diarrhea in the \u03e9ve group but less crusts, otitis, pyoderma, pruritis and seborrhea. In conclusion, subtle differences in clinical presentation between the antibody \u03e9ve and -ve dogs with thyroid disease are limited to higher rates of obesity and lethargy, and fewer cutaneous manifestations in the antibody positive dogs. None of the 32 signs in this study could be used to help identify suspect cases of subclinical thyroiditis. In addition, despite being common initiating signs for thyroid investigation, infertility, otitis and seizures were not overrepresented in any disease group suggesting that there are much more common causes for these signs other than thyroid disease or dysfunction. Summer pasture-associated pulmonary disease (SPAOPD) is a recurrent seasonal disease observed in horses residing on pasture in southeastern region of United States. It is a naturally-acquired progressive, obstructive pulmonary disease of the small airways characterized by coughing and pronounced abdominal lift at the end of exhalation. The clinical signs, laboratory and histopathologic findings were studied in 8 adult horses affected with SPAOPD and compared to 6 adult horses without evidence of respiratory disease. The clinical score was calculated by assessing the nostril flare and abdominal lift. The change in pleural pressure (\u232cPpl) was measured indirectly by an esophageal balloon during tidal breathing. Cytology and bacterial culture were performed on bronchoalveoar fluid (BALF) collected via fiberoptic endoscopy. Light microscopy of pulmonary parenchyma was performed on samples collected via percutaneous lung biopsy and at postmortem from each lung lobe.",

Both SARD and HAC are well recognized syndromes in dogs. An association between the two has been suggested in the literature and amongst veterinary practitioners. The purpose of this study was to determine prevalence of HAC in dogs diagnosed with SARD at our hospital. For inclusion, dogs must have been diagnosed with SARD between 1/1/1990 and 12/31/1998. Records of each dog were evaluated for: 1) any owner or clinician observations suggestive of HAC: polyuria (PU), polydipsia (PD), polyphagia (PP), or nonpruritic hair loss (NPHL); 2) a serum biochemistry profile and urinalysis (UA) with changes typical of HAC: urine specific gravity (SG) \u05451.020, BUN \u054520mg/dl, or increases in SAP, ALT or cholesterol (CHOL). All dogs with an abnormality consistent with HAC must have undergone at least 1 of 3 screening tests for HAC: ACTH stimulation; low dose dexamethasone; urine cortisol:creatinine. 44 dogs (3-14 yrs old; mean: 8.1 yrs; 30 females) were diagnosed with SARD. 16/44 dogs had at least one abnormality consistent with HAC. 15 dogs were thought to be PU/ PD, 11 PP, 1 had NPHL, 9 had low SG, 10 had decreased BUN. Increases in SAP, ALT & CHOL were documented in 10, 9, and 5 dogs, respectively. 8 of the 16 dogs (18% of 44; 50% of dogs with suspect HAC) had at least one screening test result consistent with the diagnosis of HAC suggesting that owners of dogs with SARD be carefully questioned regarding signs of HAC and that all dogs with SARD be evaluated with at least a serum biochemistry profile and UA.",

Since a rise in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2\u03e9 ] i ) is an important stimulus for insulin release, we investigated the role of calbindin in Ca 2\u03e9 -mediated insulin release. Methods: Two experimental systems were used: 1) pancreatic islets isolated from mice that lack the gene for calbindin production [knockout mice (KO)] and 2) a calbindin overexpression system using a transfected mouse pancreatic \u2424 cell line HC-13 cells). Fluorimetry was used to measure cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2\u03e9 ] i ) and insulin was measured using a standard RIA. Depending on the experiment, either potassium chloride, which causes insulin release via cell depolarization, or glucose was used as the stimulus for insulin release. Results: Potassium chloride (KCl) caused a larger increase in peak [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i in islets from KO mice than in control islets from wild type mice (WT) that had normal production of calbindin (1260 nM vs 670 nM, respectively; p \u03fd 0.05). The greater increase in [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i in KO islets was accompanied by an altered pattern of KCl-induced insulin release. Although the 1st phase of insulin release was the same in both types of islets, the 2nd phase of insulin release was sustained in islets from KO mice relative to WT islets, as measured by the time required for rate of insulin release to fall to 25% of the peak rate (45 min. in KO vs 29 min. in WT; p \u03fd 0.05). In experiments using HC-13 cells, we found that calbindin overexpression lowered the resting [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i (180 nM vs 215 nM in controls) and markedly inhibited KCl-induced changes in [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i (225 nM vs 820 nM in controls). Calbindin overexpression also decreased KCl -stimulated insulin release by 80 to 95% from control levels. In another series of experiments, [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i and insulin release were measured in glucosestimulated islets. In these studies, glucose elicited greater insulin release from KO islets than from WT islets. Even though the glucose-induced rise in [Ca 2\u03e9 ] i was the same for both KO Fecal occult blood testing may be necessary to detect gastrointestinal hemorrhage, before melena becomes visible. However, dietary contents can influence these tests, so it was the purpose of this study to evaluate various diets in a guaiac based (HemoFEC, Boehringer) and o-tolidine (Hemotest, Bayer) based test kit.",

This reflects the difficulty in accessing the myenteric plexus in the adult horse. Neurons were grown successfully in culture for 5 days and there is the potential to make this period longer. Three main cell types were evident in dissociated culture: neurons, enteric glia and fibroblasts. Neurons appeared to be bedded down in clumps and non-neuronal cells proliferated markedly after 2-3 days in culture. Double labelling experiments revealed that the enteric glial cells are very similar to the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system. This is the first report of equine enteric neurons being grown in tissue culture. The difficulties in accessing and harvesting these neurons in the equine intestine mean that further work is necessary in order to produce a repeatable, quantifiable in vitro model. Magnesium (Mg), an important intracellular cation, has numerous physiologic roles, but the most critical ones are associated with production and utilization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), function of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, and regulation of intracellular calcium. Hypomagnesemia has been reported to be common in critically ill human patients. Hypomagnesemia often accompanies other electrolyte abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to survey a population of 75 horses suffering from gastrointestinal disease to determine the incidence of plasma magnesium abnormalities.

In 1997-98, approximately 434 roadkill or trapped opossums were collected in Florida. Opossums weighed from 0.2 to 4.5 kg (mean 1.9 kg) and were equally divided between genders. Feces and gut scrapings were examined for sporocysts by flotation on Sheather's solution, then intestinal sporocysts were harvested from positive animals. Sporocysts were cleaned, counted, and characterized on the basis of 6 genomic DNA sequences that previously have been shown to distinguish S. neurona from S. falcatula. Isolates were either S. neurona, S. falcatula, or dissimilar to both. The last category included 3 distinct Sarcocystis genotypes (species?).",

Canine erythrocyte (RBC) survival times range from 86 to 122 days as measured by a variety of RBC labeling techniques. Recently, greyhound RBC survival times measured by in vitro biotinylation were reported to be 53.6 \u03ee 6.5 days as compared to 104.3 \u03ee 2.2 days for non-greyhound control dogs (AJVR, 57(5):739-42, 1996) .

Dams of 6 test foals showed at least a threefold increase in serum neutralizing anti-rotavirus antibody titers to rotavirus 2-3 weeks after their foals were challenged; this pattern was not seen in the dams of control foals. Two test foals experienced a fourfold rise in serum neutralizing anti-rotavirus antibody titers 3-4 weeks following challenge with rotavirus.

There were no significant differences in plasma leptin concentration in 17 female cats compared with 11 male cats with RMR (2.5 \u03ee 1.5 ng/ml Human Equivalent (HE) vs 2.1\u03ee 0.9 ng/ml HE, p\u03ed0.46) indicating that gender is not a major determinant of leptin concentration in cats. Leptin concentrations in 28 cats with RMR were not significantly different than that of the 10 healthy cats (2.3 \u03ee 1.3 ng/ml HE vs 2.4 \u03ee 0.4 ng/ ml HE, p \u03ed 0.84). Leptin concentrations in 13 cats with naturally occurring CRF were significantly higher than that of the 10 healthy cats (8.5 \u03ee 7.3 ng/ml HE vs 2.4 \u03ee 0.4 ng/ml HE, p\u03fd0.05). Furthermore there was a strong positive correlation between plasma leptin and serum creatinine concentration in 13 cats with naturally occurring CRF (R 2 \u03ed0.84, p\u03fd0.0001, leptin \u03ed 0.15 \u03e9 2.2 creatinine). Gel filtration chromatographic evaluation of plasma from 2 cats with naturally occurring CRF verified that most (81.1, 83.4%) of the observed immunoreactivity was from leptin and not products of leptin degradation or nonspecific crossreactivity of the RIA antisera. Some (13.7, 18.8%) immunoreactivity was found in fractions that would contain proteins of relative molecular weight greater than albumin, possibly leptin bound to a feline form of the soluble leptin receptor. While the mechanism of accumulation of leptin in feline CRF appears to be independent of decrements in glomerular filtration rate, hyperleptinemia could contribute to uremic anorexia and poor nutritional status commonly seen in spontaneous feline CRF. The retina and central nervous system of mammals are highly enriched in long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) including arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3). Human milk contains DHA and AA at levels high enough for their rapid accumulation in developing nervous tissues. Infant formulas provide 18 carbon precursors of LCPUFA but these appear to be inefficiently converted and the need for LCPUFA supplementation to reflect human milk remains controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate fatty acid (FA) profiles of total milk lipid extracts from dogs with emphasis on their LCPUFA content and compare them with plasma phospholipid (PL) and diet FA. Milk samples were obtained from four nursing, hereditary nephritis carrier female dogs as follows: Dog A, during weeks 1 and 2 of lactation; dog B, during week 2; dog C, during week 1 and 4; and dog D at week 5. In this way preliminary longitudinal data was also obtained in two animals over time. Diets were a mixture of premium canned and dry puppy growth products. Plasma samples were obtained from dog B at week 2 and dog C at week 4. Total lipids were extracted from all samples, phospholipids were fractionated from sera, and FA methyl esters were prepared and subjected to capillary gas chromatography. Total milk fat was determined gravimetrically.",

Mean plasma vitamin E decreased significantly in both groups after day 1 of exercise: group S (75.3 ug/ml vs. 61.1 ug/ml), (p\u03fd0.001) and control group (44.3 ug/ml vs.35.3 ug/ml), (p\u03ed0.04), however there was no further decrease. Plasma CK activity increased significantly following exercise in both groups (see figure) however there was no significant difference in CK activity at any time between the groups. Supplementation with dietary anti-oxidants increased plasma vitamin E, but not vitamin C concentrations but did not attenuate exercise-induced muscle damage in these sled dogs. Prolonged exercise, food and water deprivation, and acute enterocolitis can all produce substantial depletion of body fluid and electrolyte stores. Treatment of these problems, especially equine colitis, often requires large (and expensive) amounts of intravenous fluids. We recently demonstrated that administration of a mixture of NaCl and KCl, as a hypertonic oral paste, attenuated body weight loss by increasing voluntary water in horses performing 60 km of endurance exercise on a treadmill. Thus, we hypothesized that oral electrolyte pastes would enhance voluntary water intake in dehydrated horses and that the composition of electrolytes would further influence the rehydration process. After overnight dehydration (4-5% body weight loss) was induced by furosemide administration and withholding of water; voluntary water intake and plasma electrolyte concentrations were determined every 6 hours for 36 hours after administration of 3 oral paste doses of NaCl (total dose of 0.5 g/kg), KCl (total dose of 0.5 g/kg), a mixture of NaCl and KCl (total dose of 0.25 g/kg of each salt), or water (no electrolyte control) in 6 horses. Administration of NaCl or a mix of NaCl and KCl resulted in greater (p \u03fd0.01) voluntary water intake and body weight recovery during the first 18 hours of the rehydration period in comparison to KCl or water administration. Although plasma electrolyte concentrations remained within normal reference ranges, sodium and potassium concentrations were greatest with NaCl and KCl treatments, respectively. In addition, no adverse effects of electrolyte administration in the form of hypertonic oral pastes were observed. In conclusion, administration of oral electrolyte pastes improved rehydration of furosemide-dehydrated horses and the degree of rehydration was influenced by composition of the electrolytes administered. Thus, use of oral electrolyte pastes, in combination with intravenous fluid therapy, could reduce the cost of treatment of horses with severe fluid and electrolyte depletion.

Greyhound trainers believe that thin dogs run faster. This experiment was designed to determine if this was true. Nine racing greyhounds (2-5 years old, 23-33 kg, both sexes) were offered once daily free choice for 30 min a dry diet containing 27% metabolizable energy (ME) protein, 36%ME fat and 27%ME nitrogen free extract for 9 weeks until body weight and food intake had stabilized. Dogs were then randomly assigned to receive either free choice food or 85% of the free choice amount for 9 weeks. Dogs were then crossed over: restricted fed dogs were fed free choice and free choice fed dogs were fed 85% of this free choice amount for 9 weeks. Dogs were weighed weekly and food intake was measured daily. Food intake and body weight stabilized after the first 4 weeks of each diet period. Dogs were exercised twice daily for 15 min in a paddock and raced on an oval sand track over 500 m twice weekly. Race times were measured with a photo-finish camera. Race times, body weights and food intake were compared over the last 5 weeks of each diet period. Total body water was measured by deuterium dilution on a rest day, and blood gases, lactate, CBC and chemistries were measured, before and after racing, during the final (9th) week of each diet period. When food intake was mildly restricted, race times were shorter (32.1\u03ee0.4 vs. 32.5\u03ee0.6 secs; p\u05450.03)), ME intake was less (137\u03ee11 vs. 155\u03ee17 kcal/kg 0.75 ; p\u05450.0001), dogs were lighter (28.2\u03ee2.9 vs. 29.9\u03ee3.3 kg; p\u05450.0001) and there were fewer segmented neutrophils (2194\u03ee794 vs. 2772\u03ee553/L; p\u05450.005). There was no effect on total body water (71\u03ee6 vs. 67\u03ee3%; \u2424\u05450.2) or other blood parameters. In conclusion, greyhounds run markedly (0.4 sec or 0.2 m.sec \u03ea1 ) faster over 500 m when food intake is mildly restricted. This is equivalent to 6 m over 500 m. Intraperitoneal (IP) nutrition has been previously reported to successfully maintain dogs. The principal objective of this study was to determine the inflammatory response of the peritoneum to IP administration of nutrient solutions. Twelve healthy adult dogs were given 20% of resting energy requirements via the peritoneal cavity using a once daily, repeat-puncture technique for four days. Four dogs received a 10% dextrose solution, four dogs a 5% amino acid solution, and four dogs a 10% lipid emulsion. The remaining caloric requirements were given orally. On day 1, a baseline diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) was performed. On days 2, 3, and 4, prior to nutrient infusion, a DPL was repeated. The DPL fluid was analysed for total white cell count (TWCC) and differential. Comparisons between groups were made using ANOVA. Twice daily each dog was assessed for abdominal pain, body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, mucous membrane colour, pulse quality, and capillary refill time.",

The presence of telomerase enzyme activity in a body cavity effusion is a sensitive and specific marker for the presence of neoplasia in humans. Previous reports also indicate that telomerase activity can be detected in samples of effusions collected from dogs with neoplasia. The purpose of this study was to determine if telomerase activity is a specific feature of malignant effusions in canine and feline veterinary patients. Effusion samples were collected from client-owned animals presented to the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Center. Inclusion in the study required that routine fluid analysis, including cytology, be performed, and that a definitive diagnosis be reached through standard diagnostic tests or necropsy. A total of 42 cases were included in the study. In each case, a sample was collected into a serum tube and centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet, which was frozen at \u03ea80\u040aC until the telomerase assay could be performed. Storage time for samples had no evident impact on ability to detect telomerase activity. Each sample was assayed in tow independent experiments to determine the presence or absence of telomerase activity using a commercially available kit (Trap-eze kit; Oncor, Inc.). For telomerase negative samples, a further experiment was performed to rule out the presence of an inhibitor of telomerase activity. In no case was significant inhibition of telomerase activity detected.",

Decreases in CDV titers were not statistically significant. However, the finding of a two-fold or greater decrease in CDV titers in two dogs followed 36 and 73 days warrants further investigation in a greater number of dogs for a more lengthy study period. Strong epidemiologic evidence exists for an association between the administration of feline inactivated vaccines (primarily feline leukemia and rabies virus vaccines) and subsequent soft tissue sarcoma development at injection sites. Although additional epidemiologic evidence also suggests that postvaccinal sarcomas develop in areas of inflammation at vaccine injection sites, the studies have thus fair failed to identify a specific brand of vaccine responsible for tumor development. Inflammation is considered by many to be a necessary antecedent to tumor production at vaccine sites in cats. All currently available subcutaneously administered rabies vaccines are adjuvanted and produce injection site reactions. A new nonadjuvanted canarypox rabies vector vaccine has recently been approved for use in dogs and cats in the United States. This study evaluated the injection site reactions of five nonadjuvanted feline vaccine combination products, four of which contained the new canarypox rabies vector fraction in a rodent model that has previously been shown to mimic the local inflammatory response as observed in cats after the subcutaneous administration of feline vaccines.",

Polysorbate 80 is known to have potent histamine releasing properties in the dog (Masini et al., Agents Actions 16(6):470, 1985) , which has limited the use of Etoposide in veterinary oncology. Histamine release in the dog produces a dose-limiting effect due to hypotension, cutaneous urticaria and pruritus (Ogilvie et al., Am. J. Vet. Res. 49(8):1367 -1370 , 1988 ). These effects have not been sufficiently controlled previously with premedications to allow administration of an effective myelosuppressive dose of Etoposide (Hohenhaus and Matus, J. Vet. Internal Med. 4:239-241, 1990) . A pretreatment regimen was evaluated for use in controlling vehicle-associated clinical signs during Etoposide administration. The regimen consisting of prednisone, prednisolone, diphenhydramine and famotodine was used in a 12 dog study. Approximately 12 hours prior to the first Etoposide dose, animals were premedicated with prednisone (1 mg/kg) orally. Immediately prior to Etoposide administration on the first and second day of dosing, animals were premedicated with diphenhydramine (2 mg/ kg, IM), famotidine (0.5 mg/kg, IV) and prednisolone acetate (1 mg/kg, IM). Immediately prior to Etoposide administration on the third, fourth and fifth day of dosing, animals were premedicated with diphenhydramine (2 mg/kg, IM) and famotidine (0.5 mg/kg, IV).",

Dose administration was accomplished by the use of a Walkmed ambulatory pump. The high dose of Etoposide (60 mg/m 2 over 2 hours daily for 5 days) caused lymphopenia (50.3-69.4 % decrease), reticulocytopenia (64.9-88.1 % decrease), slight thrombocytopenia (19.6-25.5 % decrease), and neutropenia (49-54 % decrease). This pretreatment regimen controlled the adverse reactions sufficiently to allow administration of a myelosuppressive dose. The plasma exposure (AUC) of Etoposide increased with dose and there was no significant difference in exposure between the first and last day of dosing indicating that this pretreatment regimen did not interfere with pharmacokinetics. This pretreatment regimen allows increased exposure to water insoluble oncolytic compounds and histamine releasing excipients in the vehicle. The pharmacokinetic disposition of a drug depends to some degree on the duration of time over which the drug is given as well as the total dose. It is likely that different dosing regimes (infusion rates) for the same total dose of drug may result in varied toxicity and efficacy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate doxorubicin pharmacokinetic disposition and toxicoses in a large number of normal and tumor-bearing dogs of varying body weights given a single dose of doxorubicin calculated at varying body weights given at varying infusion durations (10-60 minutes). A single doxorubicin dose (0.75-1.5 mg/ kg; 25-35 mg/m 2 ) was delivered at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 0.9% saline as a 10-, 15-, 20-, or 60-minute infusion. Plasma samples were collected from each dog over a 3-hour period, centrifuged immediately, and analyzed using previously described methods in our laboratory for doxorubicin pharmacologic analysis.",

Infusion rate positively correlated with the intercept of the distribution phase, A (R\u03ed0.62, p\u03ed0.001), half-life of the elimination phase, t 1/2 (R\u03ed0.41, p\u03ed0.002), area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, AUC (R\u03ed0.65, p\u03ed0.0001), and hematopoietic toxicity (R\u03ed0.34, p\u03ed0.01). As expected, clearance inversely correlated with hematopoietic toxicity (R\u03ed \u03ea0.28, p\u03ed0.04). A faster infusion rate resulted in greater hematopoietic toxicity and a characteristic pharmacokinetic profile. Greater toxicity is likely due to higher and more prolonged doxorubicin levels in blood and bone marrow. The results of this study show the importance of normalizing dosage regimes by infusion rate rather than by infusion duration when considering dose-response phenomena in veterinary patients. Aggressive surgical removal with adequate margins is the treatment of choice for perianal adenocarcinomas in the dog. Recurrent disease is difficult to resect.

Carrier phenotype is most commonly frame overo, but can vary widely in the amount of white patterning. Augmentation of frame patterning occurs in some carriers such as extremely white calico overos. Suppression of frame patterning is less common (breeding stock), as is fusion with another prominent white patterns (tobiano, sabino overo or splashed white overo). The variation in incidence of the OLWS mutation within overo phenotypes is evidence of the genetic diversity of overo patterning and suggests the presence of other genes that affect white patterning. We believe that frame, calico, splashed white and sabino are distinct overo patterns. Other overo and overo blend white patterns are probably produced by combinations of factors to which the OLWS mutation can contribute, but is not essential. Activated coagulation time (ACT) is used to assess the coagulation of whole blood via contact activation. Because ACT testing is simple, inexpensive, and rapid, it is often recommended as an in-clinic hemostatic screen for congenital or acquired disorders involving the intrinsic and/or common coagulation pathways.

MV is the most consistent single parameter to monitor in a patient over time. Larger number of horses are needed to see if the resistive/non-resistive categories are consistent over a larger population. If so, it could suggest a fundamental difference in downstream resistance characteristics of forelimb arteries in normal horses. It has been assumed that, for some drugs, disposition may differ between pregnant and nonpregnant animals, which may necessitate a change in dose rate. We hypothesized that volume of distribution may be larger, or clearance faster, for aminoglycoside antibiotics in pregnant mares vs nonpregnant mares, which would result in lower plasma concentration. To examine this hypothesis, we administered gentamicin sulfate to seven Thoroughbred and Quarterhorse mares on two occasions, followed by plasma drug gentamicin assay and pharmacokinetic analysis. The first dose was administered 1-4 weeks before parturition (mean weight 578 kg) and the second dose was administered in the period 1-4 weeks after parturition (mean weight 518 kg). The dose administered at each time was approximately 6.6 mg/kg, IV. Plasma gentamicin concentrations were determined using fluorescence polarization immunoassay and pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a two-compartment model. The plasma concentration vs time profiles were similar, and total area-under-the-curve was almost identical for mares at late gestation vs early lactation. Mean volume of distribution at steady-state was 0.153 (\u03ee 0.02) and 0.156 (\u03ee0.03) L/kg, systemic clearance was 1.06 (\u03ee 0.17) and 1.11 (\u03ee 0.17) mL/kg/min, and mean elimination half-life was 2.2 and 2.1 hr, for pregnant and nonpregnant mares, respectively. We concluded that there were no differences in drug distribution and clearance between pregnant and nonpregnant mares. Plasma gentamicin was also assayed in plasma of newborn foals after an injection of 6.6 mg/kg to three of the mares within 60 min of parturition. Gentamicin was undetectable in plasma samples from these foals. We conclude that gentamicin distribution does not change in pregnancy, and apparently does not cross the placenta of mares at term. Chloramphenicol has been used for treating a variety of bacterial infections in dogs and cats, but because of decreased availability of some dose forms, there has been interest in substituting florfenicol, which is pharmacologically similar. Florfenicol (Nuflor) is registered for use in cattle, but pharmacokinetics for dogs and cats has not been reported. This study was conducted to determine the disposition of florfenicol in order to examine its potential as a therapeutic agent in dogs and cats. The NCCLS quality control ranges of MIC for florfenicol are 2-8 mcg/ml. Florfenicol 300 mg/ml solution was administered IM and SC to four dogs at a dose of 20 mg/kg, and a 100 mg/ml solution was administered to 6 cats IV, IM, and oral at a dose of 22 mg/kg. Florfenicol plasma concentrations were determined with high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). In dogs after IM injection, florfenicol mean peak plasma concentrations were 2.2 mcg/ ml and mean elimination half-life was 4.6 hr. Concentrations were above a MIC of 2.0 mcg/ml for less than 2 hours. After SC administration, florfenicol was absorbed poorly and inconsistently with peak concentrations less than 1.0 mcg/ ml in all dogs. By contrast, the 100 mg/ml solution in cats was absorbed well from both IM and oral routes, with peak concentrations of 19 mcg/ml and 22 mcg/ml, respectively. Absorption was high from both routes (96% and 89% from IM and oral, respectively). IV elimination half-life was 3.75 hr and volume of distribution was 0.6 L/kg. The half-life was 3.4 hr and 4.7 hr for IM and oral dose, respectively. In cats, the 100 mg/ml florfenicol formulation produced concentrations above 2 mcg/ml for 12 hr and 18 hr, after IM, and oral doses, respectively, and concentrations were maintained above an MIC of 8.0 mcg/ml for 10 hr and 6 hr after IM and oral doses, respectively. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the SC and IM pharmacokinetics of oxytetracycline approved for IM use (OXY shot LA) with those of another oxytetracycline product approved for SC use (BioMycin); and (2) to compare SC and IM pharmacokinetics of these long-acting oxytetracycline products. Each of the products was administered to 6 cattle IM and SC, using a crossover design, and blood samples were collected at frequent intervals thereafter. Concentrations of oxytetracycline in serum were determined by microbiological assay and pharmacokinetic values were calculated using a model-independent approach.",

Tilmicosin has anti-inflammatory activity that reduces the damage to the lung associated with bacterial infections. The use of bacterial infection as a model to study the anti-inflammatory activity of a drug may alter cellular morphology of BALF cells suggesting a mode of drug action. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) cell populations in calves were studied after saline lavage. Cell numbers, recovery, differential cytology and chemotaxis were determined. After 2 treatments (Tx; Tilmicosin 15 mg/kg) or nothing (Control) the calves were re-lavaged and the same parameters determined. Treatment with tilmicosin did not alter the differential cytologic features (PMN control: 27 \u03ee 11; PMN Tx: 34 \u03ee 13; Macophage control: 53 \u03ee 30; Macrophage Tx: 64 \u03ee 12) or the chemotactic index when compared to control (PMN control:2.9 \u03ee 2.1; PMN Tx: 5.5 \u03ee 5.3; Macrophage control: 4.6 \u03ee 6.4; Macrophage Tx: 7.4 \u03ee 10.9). Unlike traditional macrolides (erythromycin), tilmicosin modulates inflammation by mechanisms that do not appear to involve the ability of cells to migrate into the lung associated with mild inflammatory stimuli. The differential cytology did not suggest that apoptosis was a predominant feature of the neutrophil obtained from the lungs of calves treated with tilmicosin. The temporal variations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis and variations due to separate aliquots and lung sites were studied in 5 horses with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in 5 horses free of respiratory disease (controls). Horses were stabled in dusty conditions before (five months) and throughout experimental period. Bronchoalveolar lavage were performed as a standard method described in literature. In study 1, BALF were collected from the right lung monthly in February, March and April. In study 2, BALF analyses were performed using 2 incremental instillation of 250 ml of isotonic saline in the same bronchial site during the first monthly evaluation. In study 3, BALF were collected from both lungs and compared. BALF analysis included return volume, total count cells and differential cytologic evaluation. In study 1, COPD affected horses had significantly (p \u03fd 0.05) more neutrophils and epithelial cells, and had lower return volume and lymphocytes counts than control horses. Although not significant, there were individual variations for neutrophils in BALF in COPD affected horses throughout monthly evaluation. In study 2, the second aliquot of BALF obtained from COPD affected horses and from control horses, had signiticant less neutrophils than in the first one. In study 3, no significant difference were found in cytology and cell count from BAL fluid obtained from both lungs, in both COPD affected horses and in control horses. In studies 1, 2 and 3, COPD affected horses had neutrophils percentage \u03fe 10% and the number of neutrophils and the volume return remained significantly different between groups over time. Result of this study suggest that despite temporal effects and variations due to separate aliquots, BAL fluid analysis of COPD affected horses are consistently different from thoses of control horses.

Two dogs had adverse gastrointestinal side effects. After the loading bolus and during continuous infusion of ceftazidime, mean serum drug concentration exceeded 16g/ml (2 times MIC) in all dogs. The mean serum concentration at steady-state was 22g/ml. No adverse effects were observed. Due to the short elimination half-life and observed adverse effects, it was concluded that subcutaneous administration of ceftazidime is likely to be unsatisfactory in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infection in dogs. We predict that administration of ceftazidime as a loading bolus (4.4mg/kg, IV) and continuous infusion (4.1mg/kg/hr, IV), will be effective in the treatment of dogs with P. aeruginosa infections which are resistant to, or in dogs which experience toxicity from, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones",

Our hypothesis was that adding the preservative to the BAL fluid would be beneficial in preserving the samples for future analysis when compared to control samples taken concurrently and maintained without preservative. The Saccomanno fluid is methanol based and is used in human medicine primarily for transport and preservation of bronchial brush samples. This fluid is reported to increases diagnostic cell yield, decrease obscuring mucus, maintain cellular integrity, and limit cellular degeneration when compared to samples prepared with no preservative.BAL samples were collected using standard technique, and were then split into a study group (Saccomanno fluid added) and a control group (no additions). Samples were analyzed (total nucleated cell counts [TNCC] and cytocentrifuge differential [CYTO] counts) immediately following collection and then every 24 hours for 5 days. Comparison of the study (Saccomanno) samples to the control (non-treated) samples found that TNCC decreased daily in all samples but were not different between groups, while on CYTO there were more ruptured cells identified on the non-treated samples when compared to the treated samples, suggesting cellular deterioration of the untreated samples. While additional samples are continuing to be obtained, it appears that Saccomanno cell transport fluid media immediately added to canine bronchoalveolar lavage samples will improve cellular preservation over time when compared to similar samples not maintained in Saccomanno fluid. This should be helpful in maintaining the quality of BAL samples when transported and not processed immediately. Summer pasture-associated obstructive pulmonary disease (SPAOPD) is a recurrent seasonal obstructive pulmonary disease observed in horses residing on pasture the in southeastern region of United States. In order to identify environmental factors associated with the occurrence of SPAOPD in horses residing in Louisiana a population of 21 SPAOPD-affected horses and 8 non-affected horses were studied. The horses were evaluated clinically to determine if there was a correlation between changes in clinical signs and changes in selected climatic factors during the period of 1992 through 1994. The daily assessment included the nostril flare, abdominal lift and respiratory rate. The clinical score was calculated based on the nostril flare and abdominal lift.",

The SPAOPD-affected horses kept at pasture had a clear seasonal onset of clinical signs during late spring, especially the month of May. The clinical signs persisted until late autumn, i.e., November. The daily clinical scores and respiratory rates were positively correlated with measurements of temperature (maximum temperature and dew point temperature) in all 21 SPAOPD-affected horses. However, the degree of correlation estimated in this exploratory data suggests that mere fluctuations in daily temperature or dew point temperature are unlikely to be the sole determinants of clinical severity.The seasonal occurrence of SPAOPD and the correlation with elevations in temperature and humidity, both conditions that are conducive to mold growth and increased vegetation, are consistent with the concept that the disease may be due to a hyperresponsiveness to mold spores and/or pollens.",

OPC is a well-differentiated tumor of alveolar type II or nonciliated bronchiolar (Clara) cells that occasionally metastasizes to regional lymph nodes. Affected sheep are typically adults and present with tachypnea and coughing that worsen with exercise and bilateral nasal discharge. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe the clinicopathologic and histopathologic findings in 5 cats presented to the Teaching Hospital from 1988-1995 with a proliferative, pulmonary disease resembling OPC. No gender or breed predilections (mean age\u03ed9.6 years) were evident. Owner complaints included a 6-10 month history of progressive weight loss and a 2-week to 5.5-month history of lower respiratory signs (dyspnea (3/5), cough (3/5), tachypnea (2/5), wheezing (2/5)). In all cats, clinical signs had improved temporarily with various combinations of antibiotics with corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and diuretics. On physical examination, tachypnea (range\u03ed55-130 BPM) was the most frequent finding. Dyspnea (2/5), harsh lung sounds (2/5), cachexia (3/5), dehydration (2/5), and respiratory stridor with a serous nasal discharge (1/5) also were noted. No significant hematologic or biochemical abnormalities were observed. All cats were FeLV and FIV seronegative. Thoracic radiographs revealed a diffuse interstitial-nodular pattern with multifocal bronchoalveolar infiltrates. Lung aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytologies revealed mild to moderate nonseptic inflammation. Microbial cultures from the deep lung did not yield clinically significant bacterial or fungal growth.Gross and histologic features of lung tissue revealed striking similarities to OPC. Affected lung was pale tan and firm with multifocal white punctate foci scattered over the pleural surface. Lung parenchyma contained multiple unencapsulated, coalescing nodules containing dilated alveolar spaces lined by variably differentiating cuboidal cells resembling type II alveolar cells and columnar bronchiolar cells with patchy fibrosis. Alveolar histiocytosis, lymphocytic interstitial inflammation, and smooth muscle hypertrophy along terminal airways were common features. Hilar lymph node metastasis was found in 1 cat. Electron microscopy of lung tissue (1 cat) revealed a proliferating cell population with features suggestive of alveolar type II epithelial cells. No microbial organisms were identified by special stains.As with OPC, the prognosis for untreated feline pulmonary carcinomatosis (FPC) was poor. Four cats died or were euthanatized due to progressive disease within 4 days of diagnosis; while one cat survived 5 months with symptomatic therapy.",
