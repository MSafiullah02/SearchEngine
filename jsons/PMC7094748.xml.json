However, regional differences exist, with more B strains found in Europe and Asia. Influenza B is more common in long-term care facilities, schools, or other institutions.",

However, viral shedding peaks at 48 h of illness and declines thereafter. Thus, PCR testing of a lower respiratory tract sample for FRI with ARDS may be more beneficial. Additionally, subtyping of a suspected case of influenza-related FRI with ARDS requires virus isolation that should be sent to a public health laboratory.",

Adult infections are manifested predominately by upper respiratory tract symptoms, but some patients will have lower respiratory tract infections, including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchospasm, and acute respiratory failure and ARDS (Table 1).43\n46\n47 Lower respiratory tract disease usually occurs with primary infection in children but can occur with recurrent infections into adulthood. The elderly and immunocompromised, particularly bone marrow transplant patients, are at highest risk of respiratory failure. Diagnosis is by clinical findings during an epidemic period with rapid antigen assays, viral isolation, or RT-PCR detection.48 Treatment for bronchospasm includes bronchodilators and steroids, with ribavirin for severe and high-risk cases.49 However, one recent randomized control trial50 evaluated children < 12 months of age with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis in which the majority of cases (> 60%) were caused by RSV; the results showed that a single dose of dexamethasone did not alter admission rates, length of stay, and respiratory status. Overall, 15% of patients with infections are admitted to the ICU, and the mortality rate can be surprisingly high, at 10% of all cases in the elderly.42\n43\n45\n",

Pneumonia develops with primary infection, occurs rarely in children, and progresses to respiratory failure and ARDS.58\n59\n60\n61\n62 Pneumonia is the most frequent serious complication of VZV infection in adults, with an incidence of approximately 20% in primary VZV. Risk factors for pneumonia with respiratory failure and ARDS include pregnancy, smoking, and immunosuppression.63\n64 Pneumonia and respiratory failure develop slowly, usually a few days after the onset of rash, and are signaled by tachypnea and hypoxia.56\n58\n61\n62 Additional complications include encephalitis, hepatitis, and secondary skin and soft-tissue infections.58\n59\n60\n61\n62 The overall mortality rate for VZV pneumonia remains high at 30%; in patients requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, the mortality rate approaches 50%. Clinical examination yields the diagnosis in many cases because vesicular rash accompanies any pulmonary disease. Confirmation of diagnosis is done by viral isolation and culture, immunosorbent assay, or pathologic findings on biopsy. Treatment including acyclovir and corticosteroids has been shown to lessen hospital and ICU stay but not alter the mortality rate.59\n65 The routine use of the vaccine has altered typical presentation, with some children having breakthrough infections after only a single dose.66 These infections usually are less severe, produce < 50 lesions on average, and rarely present with pneumonia, but immunity appears to wane after 5 years. Recent recommendations66 call for a second booster dose of the vaccine within 5 years of the first.",

One study69 suggests that > 45% of cases of respiratory disease come from adults > 65 years old, causing approximately 5% of all respiratory infections. However, the extent of respiratory disease in adults is unknown and largely comes from population-based studies, not prospective cohort studies. Adult symptoms appear to include a self-limited cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea, but immunocompromised adults can have lower respiratory tract infection with respiratory failure.68\n69\n70 Progression, however, does appear rare, and no cases have been described in immunocompetent adults, and the only significant risk for progression to respiratory failure appears to be transplantation. Diagnosis is difficult because no reliable commercial assays are available, so detection is largely done by PCR on respiratory specimens. Viral culture can be easily obtained as well, but identification usually is done by public health laboratories. Treatment is supportive, especially since most cases are self limited.68\n69\n70 The mortality rate for infection with respiratory failure and ARDS is unknown, but deaths in bone marrow transplant patients have been reported.70 Transmission is largely unknown because no formal studies exist, but contact and droplet transmission is suspected.68 Although the extent and spectrum of hMPV disease is largely unknown, any suspected case in an adult with ARDS and respiratory failure should have respiratory samples sent to the public health laboratory for further investigation.",

Resolution can also occur rapidly. Notably, thrombocytopenia with a immunoblast-predominant leukocytosis and an elevated hematocrit are characteristic of the early cardiopulmonary phase.76 Diagnosis is by serologic testing of IgM in early disease and IgG in later disease through public health laboratories. Clinical contact with rodents in an endemic area with leukocytosis, elevated hematocrit, and thrombocytopenia should prompt consideration of the diagnosis. Treatment is mainly supportive, with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation being used in some patients71\n73; ribaviron has been effective in hemmorhagic fever renal syndrome but not HPS. The mortality rate remains at approximately 20%.",

Other cases may be more difficult, requiring further epidemiologic and diagnostic testing. Recent guidelines4 have suggested that testing for viral pathogens be performed in patients with clinical and epidemiologic findings suggestive of viral illness, as well as placing them in droplet or airborne isolation depending on the suspected pathogen. However, many of these viral pathogens are highly contagious emerging infections or in fact may be novel strain.7\n35 Often these patients will not be isolated and tested for these pathogens on hospital admission, and they will additionally undergo higher-risk aerosolizing procedures (Table 2) that will increase the likelihood for disease transmission. This puts both HCWs and other patients at risk for acquiring disease, as experienced during the SARS epidemic. Therefore, a standardized approach, with early isolation and testing of these cases, can reduce the likelihood of disease transmission of an emerging pathogen within the ICU.",

All patients with FRI and respiratory failure should immediately be isolated on arrival to the health-care system, and subsequently undergo initial diagnostic testing, including pretreatment Gram stain, respiratory culture, and urine antigen testing for Legionella. If an etiologic agent is identified on initial screening and clinical findings (ie, Gram-positive diplococci with a lobar pneumonia on radiography), targeted treatment and ICU admission are performed. Further isolation of the patient can be discontinued at this point, depending on the identified organism. However, if an agent is not easily identified as often seen with viral causes of FRIs, the patients should remain in isolation and further diagnostic testing should be performed. Isolation should most likely be droplet, but based on specific epidemiologic clues airborne isolation may be instituted (Table 1).20 Many cases of viral pneumonia in the ICU are suspected based on certain at-risk groups, epidemiologic clues, and specific clinical findings. If these are present, testing should target these pathogens, but viral culture and isolation should be performed to rule out other agents as well. If a certain viral pathogen, such as avian influenza or SARS, is suspected based on these clues, hospital infection control, infectious diseases, microbiology, and the public health officials should be notified immediately. Although bronchoscopy generates aerosols and can increase transmission risk, it should not be avoided in these cases because viral isolation and etiology becomes important from a public health perspective and transmission risk is low when the appropriate PPE is used. Isolation of the virus from a nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate is highest early in disease course, but by the time the patient has disease developed in the lower respiratory tract with respiratory failure, a lower respiratory sample by bronchoscopy may provide the highest yield. In addition to more specific testing, a sample should be sent for viral culture, which provides a viral isolate for further testing, subtyping, and resistance analysis if ever indicated (unless avian influenza is suspected, since this requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory). Patient isolation should remain until a diagnosis is established or the patient improves, remaining afebrile for at least 48 h. Any change in isolation status should involve an infection control and infectious disease specialist.",

Public health involvement will allow a broader viral testing, including additional agents, subtyping, and resistance testing. If the agent is a novel or emerging pathogen, as seen with SARS or avian influenza, early public health involvement will allow for rapid laboratory testing, epidemiologic investigation, case definition, and community prevention. Finally, public health also has a broader view of the disease burden within the region.
