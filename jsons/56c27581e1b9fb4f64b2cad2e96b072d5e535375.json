In 1918, Toronto's MOH Charles Hastings was the acknowledged leader of efforts to contain the disease, care for the sick, and develop an effective vaccine, because neither a federal health department nor an international body like WHO existed. During the SARS outbreak, Hastings's successor, Sheela Basrur, discovered that nearly a decade of underfunding and new policy foci such as health promotion had left the department vulnerable when faced with a potential epidemic. Lack of cooperation by provincial and federal authorities added further difficulties to the challenge of organizing contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation for suspected and probable cases and providing information and reassurance to the multi-ethnic population. With growing concern about a flu pandemic, the lessons of the past provide a foundation for future communicable disease control activities.",

            "text": "(SARS) in Mount Sinai Hospital in April 2003 exemplifies the fear and concern that outbreaks of infectious disease provoke in the families of frontline workers. 1 For historians, both the role of the media in highlighting the dangers of an epidemic outbreak and the response of health authorities recalled nineteenth-and twentieth-century reactions to cholera, typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, bubonic plague, and poliomyelitis rather than HIV/AIDS. 2 But what part was Toronto's Health Department to play in an international health crisis? As the SARS outbreak once again demonstrated, local public health organizations are the foundation for concerted community efforts to manage disease and control public panic. 3 By comparing and contrasting the way in which public health authorities in Toronto managed the 1918 influenza pandemic and SARS in 2003, we can see how a century of medical advances had conditioned the public and health care professionals to expect prompt control of communicable diseases, speedy development of a prophylactic vaccine, and effective exchange of information at the provincial, national, and international levels. But both outbreaks also demonstrated the power of negative ethnic and class stereotyping, the impact of the media in both educating and frightening the public, and the high cost in terms of human lives and devastation of the local and national economies. 4 In 1918 and 1919, the worldwide influenza pandemic is estimated to have killed between 20 and 40 million people. For European and North American nations who were just coming to the end of World War I, with its toll of 6 to 9 million dead and wounded, the flu seemed to be the fourth horseman of the apocalypse. 5 War, famine, pestilence, and death challenged Canadians, Americans, and their allies and foes both to respond to the immediate threat and to institute more formal national and international organizations to ensure that future pandemics were controlled before they could spread beyond their countries of origin. The great pandemic also gave further impetus to biomedical research that resulted in the discovery of the causative virus by British researchers in 1933. 6 As research continued, however, the complexity of influenza strains became apparent. But did public perceptions of the disease change? Was it seen as a 4. In her study The Gospel of Germs: Men, Women, and the Microbe in American Life (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998), Nancy Tomes presents a convincing argument about the impact of the \"germ\" theory on American attitudes to infectious disease and demonstrates how various groups adapted new behavior patterns and beliefs as a result. More recently, in \"Epidemic Entertainments: Disease and Popular Culture in Early-Twentieth-Century America,\" Am. Lit. Hist., 2002, 14, 625-52, she examines how contemporary problems such as the AIDS, Ebola, and West Nile viruses have been used by the media to create a climate of fear that prompts citizens to ignore significant public health threats by focusing on exotic and unlikely \"risks.\" But her focus is on the way that advertising agencies used scientific discoveries in the mid-twentieth century to sell products by claiming to educate consumers in basic health principles. The use of radio and film for similar purposes is also analyzed to demonstrate the way that science becomes part of popular discourse and is, in turn, modified by popular perceptions. killer or simply as an annual nuisance that appeared in North America every fall and winter, after it had completed its attacks on the Southern Hemisphere and Australasia? In 2003, the question for many epidemiologists and health authorities was whether SARS was the feared new version of the 1918 strain or another type of disease. 7 Lack of a readily available diagnostic test or specific symptomatology significantly hampered health authorities' response to the 2003 outbreak and prompted some officials to seek historical precedents for their containment efforts.",

Using Toronto as a case study to examine the reaction of citizens and their health departments to influenza in 1918 and SARS in 2003 provides an opportunity to probe into the changing role of local health departments and their staffs in two key crises. In 1918, Toronto was a bastion of white Anglo-Saxon Protestantism, with less than 10% of its population of neither Canadian nor British origin. The city had undergone a wave of physical expansion through the amalgamation of newly developed suburbs prior to 1914 and was the focal point for industry and commerce in Ontario. As the provincial capital, it not only housed the legislature, the Provincial Board of Health, the principal university, and the leading medical facilities, but also administered a budget equivalent to that of the provincial government. Overshadowing these characteristics was Toronto's fervent support of the war effort; it was the most imperialistic of Canadian cities in 1914, and for four long years, its 490,000 citizens provided volunteers for the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), the Canadian Army Medical Corps (CAMC), and field hospitals in France, Britain, and Canada. Civilians played their part and turned out munitions, food supplies, and clothing; bought war bonds; and planted victory gardens. 8 The arrival of a virulent strain of influenza with the returning soldiers added further stress to the final days of the conflict and challenged existing public health staff to organize to combat disease with limited numbers, limited medico-scientific knowledge, and limited resources.",

From 1945 on, the city had been a magnet for successive waves of refugees and immigrants seeking a better life for their children. By the 1980s, Toronto was the dominant economic engine for the nation. 9 But as the federal and provincial governments adopted Thatcherite and Reaganite economic policies, the city lost much needed funding for its aging infrastructure and services. This did not bode well for Toronto's Health Department, which relied on municipal taxes as well as provincial grants. Furthermore, in 1997 the province updated the mandatory programs that local health units were expected to provide, and then changed the tax base to limit business taxes that Toronto had used to fund innovative health and education programs. 10 Was Toronto ready for a possible pandemic?",

Indeed, one of the most striking differences between the two outbreaks was the administrative complexity created by the presence of competing provincial and federal authorities in 2003. 11 In 1918, Canada did not have a federal health department, provincial health departments were very small, and no international health agency 9.

Health, education, and social services were allocated to the provinces, while the federal government was responsible for national economic policy, the military, criminal law, agriculture, immigration, and only minor health duties such as immigrant inspection, quarantine, and the care of sick mariners and aboriginals. equivalent to the World Health Organization (WHO) existed. 12 By comparing and contrasting the abilities of the two local medical health officers-Drs. Charles Hastings and Sheela Basrur-to coordinate disease control efforts, develop and maintain sufficient capacity to respond to outbreaks, and communicate effectively with fellow citizens, the media, and external authorities, we will be able to gauge the impact of their activities during these crises. The parallels and differences in the two outbreaks demonstrate how the lessons of the past need to be deeply ingrained in both collective memory and public policy if present and future challenges are to be met with courage and effectiveness. 20-22, 93-96. had to be supported with economic arguments that demonstrated that spending on public health administration was an investment, not an expense. 16 Starting with a staff of three public health nurses in 1910, Hastings moved quickly to expand the health education component of his staff's work and in 1914 created a Division of Public Health Nurses. Based in district offices shared with either the police force or social agencies, the public health nurses quickly became \"guides, philosophers and friends\" for the women and children in their areas. Using a generalized system that stressed health education rather than curative services, Toronto's Department of Public Health (DPH) devoted great attention to forging links with more than 200 local voluntary groups through the Neighbourhood Workers' Association (NWA). 17 This reciprocal relationship intensified during World War I as many families received coordinated assistance from the DPH and NWA as a greater emphasis on \"scientific\" social service developed. 18 Thus the concept of teamwork was well understood and widely shared when warnings about a flu epidemic began to arise in the spring and summer of 1918.",

The federal government was responsible for military cases, but provincial medical officers and their municipal counterparts knew that they would be fighting the outbreak with limited resources since so many doctors, nurses, and inspectors were serving in the armed forces. On 19 September, the Toronto World reported cases in a military camp in Ontario. For Toronto's medical officer and its Local Board of Health (LBH), this presented a challenge, because influenza was not a reportable disease under the 1912 Ontario Public Health Act, and most doctors were hoping that the outbreak would be similar to the one in 1889-90 that had attacked primarily the elderly and apparently provided some immunity to those who survived. 20 These hopes were soon dashed. Military doctors were well aware that the flu was killing soldiers between the ages of twenty and thirty-nine with great rapidity. 21 When the disease spread into the community, it devastated the workforce, made entire families ill, and left orphans and the elderly in its wake. But what could be done to stop it? Communicable disease control was one of the main functions of municipal and provincial health departments in Canada during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but in the past it had created opposition and imposed economic hardship on those who were quarantined in their homes or sent to municipal isolation hospitals. 22 Should these conventional tactics be used against the flu?",

Articles in the October issue of the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) and personal contact with health authorities in the United States made it clear to Hastings, who was president of the American Public Health Association (APHA) in 1918, and his provincial counterpart, Dr. John W. S. McCullough, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer, that there was much disagreement about the benefits of these approaches. 24 Indeed, McCullough conducted a survey of provincial and state health officers on the merits of quarantine and isolation and found that the majority had concluded that \"these measures are impracticable.\" 25 But Mayor Thomas L. Church, the press, and most of the public expected such actions, and in cities such as Milwaukee, they were apparently effective. 26 In Toronto, however, quarantine and isolation were not implemented because the disease toll escalated so quickly as to render it ineffective on a case-by-case basis.",

When the disease first appeared in Toronto, the MOH and military authorities appealed for calm, provided a detailed description of the symptoms, strongly recommended resting in bed, and exhorted the sick to call for medical assistance. 28 The first civilian casualty was a schoolgirl who died in Toronto General Hospital on 29 September 1918. In spite of growing public pressure for isolation and quarantine, Hastings did not issue the order, because the bulk of cases were military men in the 24. The Provincial Board of Health of Ontario, \"Spanish Influenza,\" Pub. Health J., 1918, 9, 478 . This item is followed on pages 482-85 by an article reprinted from Chicago papers of 3 October 1918. Chicago's Health Commissioner, John Dill Robertson, provided citizens with information from Surgeon-General Blue of the U.S. Public Health Service that focused on the origin of the disease, its symptoms, and treatment. An editorial on page 495, entitled \"Influenza,\" reminded Pub. Health J. readers that there was ongoing controversy over Pfeiffer's bacillus as the cause of influenza and noted that the Connaught Laboratories of the University of Toronto were undertaking to study whether the causative agent was a filterable virus or B. influenzae and if a prophylactic vaccine were possible. base camp located in the city. But the child's death was a prelude to a typically rapid increase in cases and deaths; within a week, more than 10,000 students and staff out of the 66,000 students and 1,630 teachers were sick. 29 The impact on the city's hospitals was immediate and overwhelming. By 8 October, the Toronto Western Hospital was full, and half the nurses at the Grace Hospital were ill. 30 Toronto General, the city's newest and largest facility, had almost 50% of its 676 patients ill with flu by mid-October; eighty nurses fell ill, and three died. 31 As a result, surgery was canceled except for emergency operations. Similar problems beset the 350-bed St. Michael's Hospital, but the situation was further compounded by the absence of medical staff on duty overseas. The sisters of St. Joseph used student nurses, their own teaching staff, and teaching sisters from Loretto Abbey to keep the hospital functioning during the epidemic. 32 With a population of roughly 490,000 and the fear that 40% or more of the population would become ill if the European and American experience was repeated in Toronto, the MOH and his provincial counterpart moved swiftly to create additional hospital accommodation and train volunteers to care for the sick. Two hotels were commandeered and turned into emergency hospitals. To staff them, the province issued a call for an Ontario Emergency Volunteer Health Auxiliary that provided training to create a volunteer group known as the Sisters of Service. 33 Women's groups, teachers, and other women whose jobs were eliminated when their workplaces were closed attended the three-lecture course on the care of the sick and the sickroom. 34 Willing volunteers were then assigned to one of the six health department district offices or to the temporary hospitals. But as the staff at Central Neighborhood House, a settlement in one of Toronto's slum areas, noted, few of the Sisters of Service were willing to serve in their part of the city. 35 This was especially problematic for the poor and non-English-speaking immigrants because \"the assistance of neighbours, usually freely rendered during illness, was negligible owing to the contagious nature of malady . . .,\" and this required settlement house workers to provide nursing, housekeeping, and child care during the epidemic. 36 Nevertheless, volunteer work was vital, as the public health nurses (PHNs) were working \"to the point of exhaustion\" dealing with the rapid increase in sick families. Early in the outbreak, the MOH informed the Globe that the nurses were focusing their entire attention on assisting the sick, and that various inspectors had been put on twenty-four-hour duty to provide food, fuel, and other necessities to stricken families. 37 According to the anonymous author of an in-house history of the Public Health Nursing Division: \"As much hourly nursing care as could possibly be arranged was given, but it did not begin to cover the need. There were very few days that the nurses did not come into the district offices and relate some unbelievably harrowing stories.\" 38 As the epidemic progressed, Health Department staff also caught the disease, and by 23 October, 54 of 319 staff were ill, including twenty-two nurses and four doctors. 39 To deal with the growing demand for nursing care and for food, fuel, and \"bedding, night clothing, towels and even pneumonia jackets,\" the DPH turned to the Neighbourhood Workers' Association. Using Toronto's newspapers to publicize these needs, the NWA appealed to Torontonians' patriotism and civic spirit by informing readers that any and all donations of soup, money, or volunteer time would be gratefully received and that the former would be delivered to stricken homes by Boy Scouts. 40 depots to receive these items were set up throughout the city as Torontonians rallied to care for the sick.",

Whether these were included in the city's tally is unclear. But the impact of the epidemic was profound. The newspapers contained short items noting the deaths of many specific individuals, advertisements apologizing for delays in delivering bread and milk, news stories describing board-of-health meetings and the actions that resulted from its deliberations, and hortatory calls for more volunteers. The World also printed an impassioned plea arguing the benefits of gauze masks and asking that \"[E]verybody Wear A Mask To Work On Saturday Morning.\" 46 Neither Hastings nor McCullough felt that wearing masks in public was warranted, with the result that Ontarians were not required to use them as were their counterparts in Alberta and several U.S. states.",

The municipal firefighters and policemen took sick, as did trainmen and Bell Canada employees. The cold rainy weather added further stress to the epidemic when coal became difficult to obtain and fuel supplies for the sick and for industry diminished. 47 In a society that lacked unemployment insurance, the task of responding to the needs of the sick and their families fell on a populace that had already donated its time, effort, and money to winning the war and buying victory bonds. Nevertheless, the Toronto Board of Trade created an Influenza Fund and worked with the NWA and other community groups to distribute the proceeds. 48 By the beginning of November, the situation began to ease. The schools were supposed to open on 5 November, but the fuel shortage postponed the reopening for a week. Sporting events resumed, hospitals began to report empty beds, and on 11 November the Armistice was signed. 49 The celebrations that this unleashed may have contributed to another wave of the flu, but for Charles Hastings, the 1918 epidemic revealed a crucial lesson: We require the centralization of authority. Whether that be a public health service, a local government board, a department of health, a ministry of health or a secretary of health, it matters little, but all authority should be centralized under one department, if we are going to have efficient results. Every human body may be a battlefield against these invisible foes. Consequently, every individual must be trained a fighter, and though we march apart, we must fight together under one command. 50",

The ravages of the flu epidemic were cited as one of the factors justifying the extension of federal involvement in an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 51 But the real impact was at the provincial and municipal levels. In Toronto, Hastings and his staff had demonstrated the benefits of a well-organized department that had made links to other municipal services, local hospitals, and non-governmental organizations. Their experience enabled them to move quickly to take command in a crisis situation. The role of provincial authorities was somewhat more complex. As Chief Medical Officer (MO), Lieutenant-Colonel John W. S. McCullough had responsibility for all parts of the province that lacked permanent public health staff, but he was also deeply involved with his military duties. The solution was to allow Hastings and his staff to demonstrate effective community engagement and then to use this model for the rest of the province. 52 When standard disease control measures proved ineffective at stemming the rising numbers of cases, Hastings turned to prevention.

Most civilian and military health officers pinned their hopes for controlling the epidemic on either a preventive or a prophylactic vaccine. In 1914 the Connaught Laboratories had opened in Toronto to produce diphtheria antitoxin, but it quickly became the main supplier of vaccines for the war effort. 53 During the flu epidemic, Dr. R. D. Defries, the acting director, undertook the production and testing of flu vaccine using eighteen strains of the New York source and additional ones from Canadian soldiers at the base hospital. Although he was impressed by the impact of the vaccine on \"desperate cases,\" he was alert to growing evidence that the vaccine was ineffective because researchers were unable to demonstrate that the Pfeiffer bacillus was the cause of the disease and indeed had begun to argue that it was a filterable virus instead. 54 Defries later argued that \"[T]he preparation and trial of vaccine was fully warranted by the existent knowledge of the disease and its etiology,\" while Hastings commented in November 1919 that during the flu epidemic the medical profession was \"severely censured for not having discovered a vaccine,\" indicating that the public too expected science to provide a preventive for the disease. 55 But as many of the reports published in Canadian and American medical journals indicated, there was little clinical evidence that preventive or prophylactic vaccination made a difference. 56 And what about the citizens? One of the most striking features of the outbreak was the extent to which Torontonians of all social classes suffered and yet sought to help each other. The middle class and well-to-do volunteered themselves and their cars to take food, medical and nursing supplies, and doctors and visiting nurses to their patients. 57 Workers tried to maintain essential services while their customers faced a final round of privation prior to the end of the war. Teachers, homemakers, and nursing, medical, and dental students volunteered their services in hospitals and in the community. Settlement workers noted that the poor were so severely affected that they were unable to provide assistance to their neighbors-a breach of customary practice. And various immigrant groups were presented with additional challenges, as the information provided in pamphlets and local newspapers had to be translated into languages they understood. As the anonymous scribe who wrote about public health nursing noted: \"The epidemic lasted approximately two months and it was an unforgettable experience for us all.\" 58 For the health authorities who had directed local and provincial or state efforts during the epidemic, the influenza outbreak provided a challenge to their authority and expertise that led figures such as Sir George Newman and Victor C. Vaughan to lament the inability of officials to either control or prevent the disease. 59 At the rescheduled annual APHA meeting in Chicago in December 1918, a committee was formed to prepare \"A Working Program against Influenza,\" which was published in the January 1919 issue of the APHA journal. This comprehensive review of the strengths and weaknesses of the efforts to combat the disease justified its prescription for action by noting that health agencies \"must act in light of present knowledge,\" even if that knowledge is limited or flawed. 60 But it is clear that there were many variables that affected the progress of the disease, and that finding the cause and an effective vaccine was high on the medical community's agenda. For local health officers, however, the extent of public cooperation during Ironically, the support that Toronto's Health Department had received in 1918 proved limited. As the city returned to \"normalcy\" in 1919, the mayor and Board of Control recommended budget cuts to municipal services, including the Health Department. The effective organizing and yeoman services that staff had performed during the flu epidemic were forgotten or ignored when a mild form of smallpox appeared in October 1919. Anti-vaccination groups organized rallies attended by some city council members who objected to Hastings's dynamic leadership and his demand that mandatory vaccination be instituted. This well-established preventive measure was condemned as \"German Born Compulsion\" and rejected as antithetical to the principles of liberty and democracy for which the war had just been fought. Were the anti-vaccinationists reflecting concern at the inability of the medical profession to prevent the flu epidemic through immunization, or was their opposition to compulsory vaccination a postwar rejection of the social and moral authority of Progressive experts and their domination of the war effort? 65",

            "text": "From 1919 to 2003, municipal and provincial health departments continued to be legally responsible for control of communicable disease. But with the development of vaccines against childhood diseases, the eradication of smallpox, and the use of antibiotics to treat tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases, the war on disease appeared to be won. As attention and staff interest shifted to behavior modification and encouraging community development, the financial resources and personnel devoted to disease surveillance, infection control, and isolation/quarantine diminished. 66 Instead of TB sanatoriums, preventive measures, and mass chest screening and tuberculin testing, for example, the Communicable Disease Control (CDC) unit in Toronto was using directly observed therapy against a resurgence of tuberculosis in the late 1990s. 67 But would this client-specific approach prove effective against a future pandemic? What role would municipal health departments be expected to play in the event of such outbreaks? Experts and pundits began to warn about the possibility of a worldwide pandemic of influenza during the 1970s and 1980s, in the wake of the 1957 and 1968-69 of tuberculosis, followed by human deaths from avian flu, was coupled with growing concern about environmental degradation. 68 In Ontario, the 2000 pathogenic outbreak of E.coli as a result of water contamination in Walkerton demonstrated the price that communities paid for failing to maintain basic services. A commission chaired by Justice Frank O'Connor highlighted the effect of provincial government cuts to the Ministry of the Environment and noted that it had failed to share vital information with local and provincial health authorities. 69 During the Harris regime from 1995 to 2002, the provincial government pursued tax cuts and reorganization of provincial services that focused on downloading duties to municipalities and regional governments. Convinced that Toronto and its surrounding cities-Scarborough, North York, the Borough of York, East York, and Etobicoke-were duplicating services, the province compelled them to amalgamate in 1997. This meant that the Toronto Health Department had to incorporate staff from the other five municipalities, determine whether its programs and services were appropriate to the new city, and try to find economies that would assist the new city's budget committee in dealing with its declining revenues. 70 The new MOH, Dr. Sheela Basrur, was a graduate of the University of Toronto (M.D. 1982, MHSc. 1987) who had been the MOH of the East York Health Unit, which had approximately fifty employees. In 1998 she became the leader of over 1,800 staff, serving a population that was significantly different from its historical roots. 71 In addition to expanding in terms of territory, the new city had a multi-ethnic population that included 14.7% East and Southeast Asians, 10.8% South Asians, 1.9% West Asians, 2.6% Africans, 6% Caribbeans, 19% North Americans, 27.4% British, and 1% Aboriginals. 72 Fortunately, Toronto Health had been hiring community workers from the various ethnic groups since the 1980s in recognition of the need to provide culturally sensitive approaches to health education and preventive services. But would Toronto Public Health, as the new entity was known, be able to maintain its national and international reputation for innovative community-responsive public health services in the face of the province's mandatory programs and limited funding? The 1995 election of the Progressive Conservatives led by Mike Harris compounded the financial difficulties already facing Toronto Public Health as a result of the recession of the early 1990s. The Harris regime was committed to cutting government spending and staff, dismantling publicly owned utilities, remaking the public education system, downloading as many social service and welfare activities as possible, and privatizing certain environmental and health services. For TPH, staff cuts, program closures, and the pressure to reorganize and redefine future goals meant focusing on children, families, and specific \"high-risk\" groups such as HIV/AIDS victims and street people rather than expanding CDC activities. 73 In addition, the city's many acute-care hospitals and long-term-care facilities were struggling to maintain service levels because of funding shortfalls and declining numbers of staff. A widespread flu outbreak in the winter of 2002 had resulted in the deaths of several citizens who had not received prompt assistance in overcrowded emergency wards. As a result, the province introduced mass flu vaccinations in the fall of 2002. The immunization program was offered free to citizens through public clinics or their family physicians. But would this voluntary program be sufficient to protect Torontonians from the feared pandemic? Health Canada had been attempting to develop a national flu pandemic program, but Ontario was not supportive, preferring to develop its own approach, since the Harris Conservatives were engaged in an ongoing conflict with the Chr\u00e9tien Liberals over which level of government had the authority to design Health to alert them to this possible problem. By 13 March, however, the tuberculosis test was negative, more people were sick, and infection-control experts at other Toronto hospitals were working with TPH to identify the new disease. On 12 March, the World Health Organization had issued a Global Alert announcing outbreaks of atypical pneumonia in Hong Kong and Hanoi, and this enabled TPH and Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious-disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital, to identify the mystery illness. 76 \"In consultation with provincial and federal health officials, TPH held a press conference on March 14, activated its emergency response plan, established a public information hotline and assigned staff full-time to the outbreak investigation.\" 77 This succinct statement fails to convey the sense of crisis that existed as all three levels of health authorities discovered the weakened state of communicable disease control measures. For more than fifty years, TPH had not imposed quarantine on its citizens, and although the provincial Health Promotion and Protection Act contained provisions to do so, TPH staff lacked recent experience. Even more challenging was the lack of knowledge regarding the disease itself. What was its cause? How was it spread? Where was it most likely to be contracted? What was the incubation period? How should it be treated? Who should be responsible for informing the public, provincial and federal authorities, and the WHO about suspected and probable cases?",

The situation was further complicated because of international air travel and the growing demand for preventive precautions at Pearson International Airport, located in Mississauga, outside the bounds of TPH's jurisdiction.",

In addition to its printed materials, the TPH website posted descriptions of the symptoms as well as guidelines on hand-washing and quarantine procedures in fourteen languages. More than 200 staff did daily double shifts from 8 A.M. to 11 P.M. on the SARS Hotline, which received over 300,000 calls during the outbreak, 47,567 in a single day. Although staff worked diligently, they were aware that the fragmentary information they provided early in the outbreak caused frustration for many callers. As Justice Campbell commented: \"The problem was not lack of dedication and effort, but the fact that it was impossible in the middle of a rapidly expanding crisis to create the necessary infrastructure.\" 79 Nevertheless, in recognition of the ethnic diversity of the city and the origins of the outbreak, TPH worked closely with the Chinese community, which had created a Community Coalition Concerned about SARS. This group trained Chinese-, Mandarin-, and Cantonese-speaking volunteers to staff a 6180 hotline (the numbers sound like the Chinese word for \"I'm willing to help you\"), produced and distributed Chinese-language SARS material, did promotional activities for hard-hit Chinese businesses, and raised research money for SARS studies. 80 During the course of the outbreak, TPH's Case Management Team was involved in 2,000 investigations that required consultation with infectious-disease specialists because the symptoms were atypical and no diagnostic test was available, even though the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was established by British Columbia's Michael Smith Genomic Sciences Centre on 12 April. 81 The lack of clear diagnostic criteria complicated control procedures because TPH staff and their clinical colleagues were aware of the stigma attached to the disease and of the danger of missing a case. To compound their difficulties, technology failed at this critical moment. When the outbreak started, the only available diseasereporting system was a fourteen-year-old DOS-based one known as RDIS (Reportable Disease Information System). It was quickly apparent that this disease-specific program would not work, and TPH turned to paper files with Post-it notes to keep track of cases and their contacts. Within two weeks Excel spreadsheets were also in use, but at no point was the technology sufficiently flexible to provide the type of information and analysis that would have enabled a clearer picture to emerge. 82 The challenge of contact tracing and quarantine supervision was immense, as over 23,300 people were identified as contacts in each of the two waves of the disease and 13,374 spent ten days isolated in their homes. While they were in quarantine, staff from TPH phoned once or twice a day to see if they had any symptoms and to find out if emergency food supplies from the Salvation Army or Canadian Red Cross were required. In spite of frustration caused by having to review their situation with each TPH staff member who contacted them, very few Torontonians refused to comply with voluntary quarantine procedures. Only twenty-seven isolation orders were issued during the outbreak. 2004, 2, 265-72 , in which Torontonians and health care personnel who had been quarantined reported that they had complied with quarantine requests \"to reduce the risk of transmission to others,\" to protect community health, and because they saw it as their \"civic duty.\" Fear of legal consequences had little influence in the decision to undergo the hardship that ten days in isolation imposed.",

As in 1918, this resulted in the cancellation of all surgical procedures, limited emergency access, and the cancellation of appointments and elective procedures. All visitors were banned, including families seeking to care for dying relatives. Four days later, this draconian measure was applied to the province in general to protect health care workers and to prevent the spread of SARS into the general population. 86 By the middle of April, the number of new cases was declining and health authorities began to think that the worst was over. 87 85. Chapter 2 of Learning from SARS describes the \"Quest for containment\" between 8 April and 23 April, 10-12, and notes that the media highlighted each story about possible community spread, leaving the impression that TPH and provincial authorities were not doing their jobs effectively. Provincial officials and hospital spokespeople had issued daily reports on the number of actual, probable, and suspected cases and provided the media with information to calm public anxieties over the Easter and Passover holidays. As in 1918, religious groups were asked to use common sense and to avoid shaking hands, kissing, sharing common communion cups, and organizing large gatherings, including funerals. But as post-outbreak studies indicated, the mixed messages that the daily briefings provided did not convince external observers that the situation was under control. 88 April the ban was lifted, but the international publicity and the continuing cancellation of conferences and conventions meant that Toronto's economy was suffering greatly. 91 The loss of jobs in the tourism and hospitality industries added to the stress, and the civic and provincial governments turned to marketing campaigns in an effort to reassure Torontonians and visitors that the city was safe to visit. During late April and early May, staff from North York General Hospital sought advice from TPH regarding possible SARS cases in the psychiatric ward and among elderly post-operative orthopedic patients. Since none of these people could be linked epidemiologically to previous cases, the situation remained in flux until an ICU nurse from North York General was admitted to the Toronto Western Hospital with SARS. In the interim, possible SARS patients had been transferred to St. John's Rehabilitation Hospital and the Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care. 92 The province announced publicly that a second wave of the disease had appeared on 23 May, and the criticisms of all the flaws and failures that external critics had been making about the city's inability to control the disease increased in volume. Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien had already appointed a national commission led by Dr. David Naylor, then Dean of Medicine at the University of Toronto, to investigate the outbreak, and now the Ontario Minister of Health, Tony Clement, announced the creation of an expert panel on SARS and infectious disease chaired by Dr. David Walker, Dean of Medicine at Queen's University in Kingston. And finally, on 10 June, Ontario's then-Premier, Ernie Eves, named Justice Archie Campbell to head a judicial commission to take testimony from patients, families, health care workers, and their representatives. These reviews made SARS one of the most intensively studied disease outbreaks in Canadian history, and the Naylor, Walker, and Campbell reports all stressed the lack of coordination, capacity, and communication that bedeviled federal/provincial/municipal relations in Ontario during the crisis.",

Although TPH staff had worked with the seventy-eight long-term-care facilities in the city to ensure that their infection control practices were effective, they had not provided the same level of service to acute care hospitals, because of budget cuts and because there were supposed to be infection control officers and committees in place. 97 As a result, the trust that enabled Hastings and McCullough to rely on their academic and hospitalbased colleagues for curative services did not exist, and TPH moved to create effective relationships with Toronto hospitals by establishing a communicable diseases hospital liaison unit. This was fully funded by the province from June 2003 to March 2004, with a commitment for 50% funding thereafter. But as the Toronto Star reported, city bureaucrats think that unless the province pays the entire cost, the city should scrap the unit. Not surprisingly, TPH has argued that this unit is a critical part of future disease control efforts if a seamless transition from preventive to curative services is to be provided. 98 In both outbreaks, communication was a vital part of the MOH's role. In October 1918, Hastings responded promptly to press queries, relying on his well-established ties with various newspapers to ensure that a message of calmness and fortitude was presented. The extent of the epidemic meant that many reporters, typesetters, and delivery boys were among the ill, with the result that the official view was rarely questioned. As well, stories about the final days of the First World War occupied many readers' attention. In 2003, the local press was initially very supportive and provided excellent summaries of existing knowledge regarding symptoms and where to seek help. 99 The nightly news included the daily press conferences attended by senior provincial officials, local infectious-disease specialists, and Dr. Basrur. Her calmness throughout the crisis had an impact, according to one Toronto hospital's administrative assistant: \"When the medical officer of health gets on TV and says everything is ok, we believe her.\" 100 Unfortunately, the information provided by hospital-based specialists and provincial authorities seemed to contradict the MOH's steady confidence in her staff and their activities. 101 As the Naylor, Walker, and Campbell reports suggest, this approach was ultimately perceived as indicating a lack of leadership and a possible attempt at covering up the extent of the outbreak. In retrospect, a single spokesperson would have been advisable, but there was little that any of the officials could do to overcome the voracious appetite of the media for information.",

Gallant as these attempts to jump-start Toronto's economy and promote solidarity with potential voters were, they did not mask the underlying tension between the two levels of government. TPH was caught in the middle because it was the body that had to help people qualify for federal employment insurance, provide food and other necessities while they were in quarantine, and respond to all the calls for information that flooded the hotline. Perhaps the most difficult ones to deal with were those asking for assistance in avoiding ethnic stigmatization. With its origins in China, SARS provided critics of Canadian immigration policy with a platform from which to vent their concerns. But the April outbreak among a charismatic Filipino religious group meant that they too were treated with hostility and fear. 103 As previously noted, nineteenth-and twentieth-century epidemics were replete with racist critiques directed against the presumed human vectors of diseases such as cholera, typhus, and plague. Even AIDS prompted a similar response because of the high morbidity rate within the Haitian community. 104 But one of the striking features of the SARS outbreak was the uniform condemnation of racist epithets by politicians, reporters, and concerned members of the public.",

Each of the official reports commented on the sense of \"fear, anger, guilt and confusion\" that health care professionals felt as they tried to protect themselves and their families from the disease and from the fear evinced by their fellow citizens. Even more perturbing was the rift that appeared when provincial public health experts suggested that some of the in-hospital transmission occurred because of lack of hand washing, lack of proper use of N95 masks, and lack of common sense about staying home if symptomatic. 105 A team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta was invited to Toronto to adjudicate this dispute, but well after the outbreak was over, it was revealed that very few of the N95 masks had been properly fitted. Little wonder that hospital-based nurses who appeared before each of the commissions of inquiry were vehement in their criticism of the way the outbreak was handled. 106 For these frontline workers, the SARS outbreak demonstrated once again the gap between theory and practice in clinical settings and the continuing hierarchy that privileged medical rather than nursing and other staff.

SARS was an unknown virus whose incubation period, degree of virulence, symptomatology, treatment, and sequelae were determined through experience and monitoring events in Hong Kong, Singapore, Hanoi, and other stricken centers. 107 In both instances, local public health agencies were the principal agents of the state because they provided the organization and staff to conduct casefinding home visits, arrange contact tracing and quarantine measures, and organize hospital accommodations for the seriously ill. These standard disease-control measures were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the 1918 epidemic, but the volunteer efforts of many citizens meant that the supportive care needed to prevent flu sufferers from succumbing to pneumonia and other sequelae was available. In 2003, the unity of purpose that had linked Toronto's Health Department, city hospitals, and the Neighbourhood Workers' Association no longer existed. The hospital sector dominated much of the press coverage, and the cleavage between provincial officials and nurses' unions became widely known as a result. 108 \"Name, blame, shame\" replaced the deference to authority that had marked early twentieth-century news reports. Nevertheless, the work of TPH staff was recognized by international experts, and on 12 July 2004, Mayor David Miller presented Dr. Barbara Yaffe, the acting MOH, and frontline staff with the Canadian Public Health Association Certificate of Merit Award for \"their exceptional contribution in managing the SARS crisis\" by \"controlling the outbreak and implementing one of the largest quarantines in modern history.\" 109 Such recognition from peers and colleagues across the country is welcome confirmation that in spite of all the flaws and failures, Toronto Public Health fulfilled its obligations. And in his second interim report, Justice Campbell argued for the primacy of local and provincial medical officers, stating that they \"must have the lead role in public health emergency mitigation, management, recovery, coordination and risk communication.\" 110",

The 1918 flu epidemic was cited by epidemiologists and historians as a possible parallel, largely, one suspects, because it has recently been the subject of renewed research and because it was worldwide. 111 But was there perhaps another reason? Were reporters and newscasters seeking reassurance that all would be well and that civilization would survive? In the western media, attention was divided between the war in Iraq and the SARS outbreak. In the twenty-first century, death in combat seems somehow more comprehensible than death from disease. But as environmental degradation proceeds and species-jumping viruses and bacteria multiply, the certainties that pervaded twentieth-century western medicine are beginning to fade. In their place is increasing respect for the ability of microorganisms to mutate and a determination to use all available scientific tools to combat threats to human health. To date, three vaccines have been developed against SARS; the Sino-European project on SARS Diagnostics and Antivirals has reported that cinanserin, a drug for schizophrenia, is a useful therapy; and Dr. Josef Penninger's research team has demonstrated that the protein ACE2 can be used to combat the fluid buildup that killed SARS patients. 112 Clarifying the clinical picture and finding effective medications may remove the fear that epidemic diseases create, but, as this review of disease control activities has demonstrated, age-old methods such as case identification, contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation are the first stage of containment and hopefully eradication. Toronto's experiences in 1918 and 2003 demonstrate \"the power of public health\" as the bedrock of disease control efforts.",

Dr. Sheela Basrur has been appointed the new Chief Medical Officer of Health, and the powers of the position have been expanded to enable future planning and better coordination. 113 Does this signal the senior governments' recognition of the crucial importance of prevention? Has the balance of power within the biomedical world shifted, or will the SARS outbreak fade from memory as quickly as the events of 1918?

Indeed, one of the results of the epidemic was the conversion of the Canadian Red Cross war effort into peacetime service that included funding the development of public health nursing programs at Canadian universities and supporting nurses to attend them. 63 In May 1919, the Canadian Public Health Association, the Ontario Health Officers Association, and the Ontario Medical Association all met together in the Physics Building at the University of Toronto. On the morning of 26 May, the delegates heard papers on the new federal department of health by Dr. Michael Steele, Member of Parliament, and state health insurance by Dr. Charles Hastings, and then in the afternoon, there was a symposium on influenza that featured speakers such as Drs. Wade Hampton Frost of the United States Public Health Service, Augustus Wadsworth of the New York State Laboratory, and John McCullough.64  Clearly the flu epidemic had influenced both clinical and preventive medicine in terms of organizational structure, administrative process, and scientific research.

Under the dynamic direction of Dr. Charles J. Hastings, Toronto's Medical Officer of Health from 1910 to 1929, Ontario's capital became a showplace for modern methods of public health administration and preventive activity. 14 Between 1910 and 1917, Hastings spearheaded the introduction of pasteurized milk, well-baby clinics, municipal housekeepers, and health education by public health nurses based on successful examples found in leading British and American cities. 15 He quickly became a spokesman for progressive public health activists, arguing that \"one reason why advances in preventive medicine have been so slow is that prevention lacks dramatic interest\" and that, as a result, appeals to humanitarianism12.

What does this type of analysis tell us about how society reacts to disease threats? And how can the lessons of these traumatic experiences be integrated into future planning? In comparing and contrasting the Toronto Health Department's response to pandemic influenza in 1918 and SARS in 2003, three main areas of comparison emerge: coordination, capacity, and communication. In 1918, Charles Hastings was indisputably in charge of the city's efforts to stem the flu because there were no senior agencies to provide direction from either Ottawa or Geneva. Nearly ninety years later, Sheela Basrur had a similar role and responsibilities under the Health Protection and Promotion Act, but she was not recognized as the dominant leader because the disease had national and international implications, and therefore Health Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, and the province's emergency measures and public safety unit all participated in determining how the outbreak would be handled. As the Naylor, Walker, and Campbell reports make clear, Basrur and her staff worked twenty-hour days to contain SARS. They were assisted by volunteers from other Ontario health departments, other provinces, and the United States, but found that in contrast to the close, collegial links that Hastings and his staff had with Toronto hospitals and provincial authorities, there was conflict and confusion over activities95.
