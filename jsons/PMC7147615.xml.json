The predominant HAdV genotypes detected in association with clinical presentation differ among different countries and may change over time.16 Currently in Switzerland, the knowledge on the molecular epidemiology and clinical presentation of HAdV infection is lacking. This study presents the molecular epidemiology of HAdV and associated clinical findings based on a retrospective observational study from laboratory confirmed HAdV cases collected between 1998 and 2017, at the Institute for Infectious Disease (IFIK), following referral of specimens by clinicians from the largest hospitals and other regional clinics in Bern. Since outbreaks of HAdV have been reported in various countries,10,15,17-19 we therefore hypothesized that a thorough epidemiological analysis of the Bern HAdV clinical bio-bank, including genotyping and comparison to strains involved in international outbreaks, would provide information on potential outbreaks of HAdV that occurred in the last 20 years in Switzerland and how the epidemiological situation compares to that seen elsewhere in Europe during the studied period. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report HAdV epidemiology from a large clinical dataset over a 20-year period from patients of any age with positive HAdV infection. Overall, the study sheds light on epidemiological trends, risk factors for infection, and molecular epidemiology of HAdV circulating genotypes.",

An increased number of HAdV positive cases occurred in years 2009 and 2010, with 110 and 112 cases, respectively (Figure 1A). A heat map of the monthly incidence showed that HAdV appeared to occur throughout the year. Although the data showed no clear seasonality, a pattern reminiscent of HAdV outbreaks was observed particularly in January 2010 (n = 24), July 2009 (n = 33), and March 1998 (n = 24). The mean expected incidence of HAdV cases per month from 1998 to 2017 was 5.43 cases (95% CI, 1.86\u201312.26 cases). Therefore, HAdV incidence of \u226513 cases was defined as significantly higher number than the mean expected incidence (Figure 1B).",

Although long-term epidemiological trends demonstrated no clear seasonality, a pattern reminiscent of recurring outbreaks was evidenced with high number of HAdV cases observed in January 2010, July 2009 and March 1998 as compared to other months or years during the study period. Genotyping of samples from years 2010 and 2009 identified HAdV8 as predominant genotype causing HAdV infection among young adults, middle-aged and elderly, and HAdV1 and HAdV2 as predominant genotypes causing HAdV infection among young children. Although HAdV infections are known to fluctuate over time, increased cases of HAdV infections were evidenced among young children every 4 years. This study is the first to report such recurring pattern. Previously, Heo and colleagues23 showed that cases of HAdV respiratory infection are common during winter and spring. A study by Yao and colleagues concluded that HAdV prevalence may be related to age and season.24 Our findings suggest that increased HAdV infection in Switzerland was related to age, but to a lesser extent to a particular season, as HAdV infections occurred throughout the year. Also when detected, HAdV was predominantly found among those aged \u22644 years. HAdV is therefore confirmed to be an important pathogen in clinical practice, mainly in the paediatric population.",

In the same line of evidence, most HAdV infections in immunocompromised hosts are known to be associated with HAdV species C genotypes 1 and 2.14,29 Our study focused on molecular typing of HAdV positive samples collected between 1998 and 2017 among young children \u22644 years in order to identify the genotypes associated with an increase of cases of HAdV infection among this age category every 4 years. Various genotypes were identified to be causing HAdV infections, among which HAdV1 and HAdV2 genotypes were predominantly detected in the years with reoccurring peaks.

In our study, we noticed that, besides these genotypes, other HAdV genotypes were identified in those presenting with gastrointestinal infection (Figure 5B), a finding that is similar to what was reported by Kumthip and colleagues.39 In addition, it is known that specific HAdV species have distinct tissue tropism which may determine the clinical presentation.40",

As such, targeting other regions of the HAdV genomes such as fiber, penton base, and/or DNA polymerase genes may provide further information on differences among circulating HAdV genotypes, may help clarify the HAdV genotypes and also identify recombination events.",

First, our reported trends likely underestimate the true burden of HAdV infections in both the hospitalized patients and in the community, as samples sent for laboratory diagnostic testing to the IFIK rely on request by physicians, when an adenovirus infection is suspected. Second, samples were tested using different diagnostic methods for HAdV and some methods are known to be less sensitive for HAdV detection than others.46 Therefore, there is a chance that this could have also affected the results of our study. Third, some of the clinical information was missing, hence restricting interpretation of trends in HAdV clinical presentation associated with circulating genotypes. In addition, clinical information was obtained from electronic clinical records provided to the IFIK diagnostic department and could not be improved in most of the cases. Fourth, several HAdV positive samples could not be genotyped due to unavailability/lack of sample material. Although the missing information was not systematic for a particular age group, sample type or year, the unavailable information might have biased our results and therefore, the reported HAdV genotypes might not be fully representative of circulating HAdV genotypes in a given year. In addition, a complete quantitative description of the main genotype (s) causing an increase in HAdV infection every 4 years among young children could not be reached due to this lack of samples.",

Patients of various age categories were identified to be infected, with peak years in 2009 and 2010. In these 2 years, HAdV8 was identified as the predominant genotypes and was associated with HAdV infections among young adults, middle aged and the elderly, whilst HAdV2 and HAdV1 genotypes were identified to be predominantly causing HAdV infection among young children. The findings support that variation in the clinical presentation and epidemiology of HAdV genotypes exists, and may present unexpected patterns when long-term records are examined. By uncovering HAdV molecular epidemiology and its clinical presentations in our 20-year observation study, we have highlighted the existence of differences in HAdV infections among various age categories and circulating HAdV genotypes. Future work will be performed to sequence the whole genomes of representative HAdV isolates to assess the recombination potential in our strain collection.",
