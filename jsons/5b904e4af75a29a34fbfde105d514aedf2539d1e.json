The causative agent of the outbreak was identified by the WHO as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), producing the disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The virus is closely related (96.3%) to bat coronavirus RaTG13, based on phylogenetic analysis. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed even from asymptomatic carriers. The virus has spread to at least 200 countries, and more than 1,700,000 confirmed cases and 111,600 deaths have been recorded, with massive global increases in the number of cases daily. Therefore, the WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases. In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread. To date, there are no available vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs to treat the virus. There are many knowledge gaps about the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, leading to misinformation. Therefore, in this review, we provide recent information about the COVID-19 pandemic. This review also provides insights for the control of pathogenic infections in humans such as SARS-CoV-2 infection and future spillovers.",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are one of the largest groups of viruses that belong to the order Nidovirales, suborder Cornidovirineae, and family Coronaviridae. Coronaviridae is classified into two subfamilies, namely, Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae. Letovirinae includes the Alphaletovirus genus, while Orthocoronaviridae is further classified on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and genome structure into four genera: Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV), Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3CoV), and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4CoV), which contain 17, 12, 2, and 7 unique species, respectively (ICTV 2018). The most recent classification of the Coronaviridae is shown in Table 1 . Corona in Latin means crown, and this name was attributed to the virus due to the presence of spike projections from the virus envelope that give it the shape of a crown under the electron microscope; Nido means nest and refers to the ability of the viruses of this order to make a nested set of subgenomic mRNA [25, 35] .",

A human coronavirus (HCoV) was first isolated in 1960 from hospitalized patients who suffered from common cold symptoms and was named B814 [36] . So far, the seven different HCoVs that infect humans are 229E, NL63, which belong to \u03b1 CoVs, and HKU1, OC43, SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV-2, which belong to \u03b2CoVs. In 2002-2003, a pandemic caused by SARS-CoV (lineage B \u03b2CoV) originated in China [37] . In the Middle East, MERS-CoV (lineage C \u03b2CoV) emerged in 2012 [27] . In 2019, a newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, closely related to bat SARS-related CoVs, was clustered with lineage B \u03b2CoV. Chan et al. [13] demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 represents a distinct lineage in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (previously, lineage 2b of \u03b2CoV) [38] . Additionally, other coronaviruses have caused pandemic diseases in domestic and wild mammals and birds, leading to high mortality rates and severe economic losses. These viruses include IBV in chickens [40] , Beluga whale coronavirus SW1 (BWCoV-SW1) [41] , bat coronaviruses CDPHE15 and HKU10 (ICTV 2018), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), TGEV, and sudden acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS-CoV) [42] .",

As of 14 April 2020, there are a total of 7655 complete genomes from 67 countries in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database [43] (Table 2) . A reference genome is now available in the NCBI genome database (29,903 nucleotide, Reference Sequence: NC_045512.3) [44] . To date, there are a total of 875 sequences including one RefSeq sequence and 768 complete genomes at NCBI. SARS-CoV-2 is a monopartite, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA virus with a genome size of 29,903 nucleotides, making it the second-largest known RNA genome. The virus genome consists of two untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5 and 3 ends and 11 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode 27 proteins (Table 3) . The first ORF (ORF1/ab) constitutes about two-thirds of the virus genome, encoding 16 non-structural proteins (NSPS), while the remaining third of the genome encodes 4 structural proteins and at least 6 accessory proteins. The structural proteins are spike glycoprotein (S), matrix protein (M), envelope protein (E), and nucleocapsid protein (N), while the accessory proteins are orf3a, orf6, orf7a, orf7b, orf8, and orf10, as shown in Figure 1 [2, 13, 38, 45] . The 5\u2032UTR and 3\u2032UTR of SARS CoV-2 are comprised of 265 and 229 nucleotides, respectively. Orf1ab is 21,290 nucleotides and encodes either replicase proteins pp1a of 4405 amino acids (aa) (nsp1-nsp11) or pp1ab of 7096 aa (nsp1-nsp16), according to ribosomal frameshift. Of these proteins, (1) nsp1 suppresses the antiviral host response, (2) nsp3 is a papain-like protease, (3) nsp5 is a 3CLpro (3C-like protease domain), (4) nsp7 makes a complex with nsp8 to form a primase, (5) nsp9 is responsible for RNA/DNA binding activity, (6) nsp12 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), (7) nsp13 is confirmed as a helicase, (8) nsp14 is a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease (ExoN), 9) nsp15 is a poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease (XendoU). The remaining nsps are involved in transcription and replication of the viral genome [13, 46, 47] .",

The analysis of the receptor-binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed similar binding affinities [60] . Wu et al. [2] found a total of 27 amino acid substitutions in the S protein but not in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly interacts with hACE2, which may affect host tropism. These 27 substituted residues were distributed as follows: 17 in the S1 subunit [6 in the RBD and 6 in the subdomain (SD)] and 10 in the S2 subunit. Wan et al. [58] reported similarity in the spike protein RBD, including RBM, of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, in addition to the presence of several residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBM that favor the interaction with human ACE2. These results agree with the genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2, according to which the S2 subunit of the spike protein shares 99% identity with those of two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVZXC21 and ZC45) and of human SARS-CoV [13] . While the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit was conserved, the S1 subunit shares an overall 70% identity with those of bat and human SARS-CoV. The RBD core domain of S1 is highly conserved, with most of the amino acid differences located in the external subdomain that is responsible for the direct interaction with host receptors [13] . Investigators have also reported the presence of a polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Differences in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the high contagious nature of this virus suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved via natural selection for binding to human ACE2 receptor [61] .",

One week later (13 April 2020), the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 increased 1.7 times (up to 524,514 confirmed cases), and the number of deaths increased 2.5 times (up to 20,444 deaths) in the USA alone. The number of confirmed cases, deaths, and infected countries are shown in Table 4 . ",

            "text": "The origins of more than 75% of coronavirus infections are considered zoonotic, i.e., animals are the main source of the outbreaks. For example, SARS-CoV was transmitted from palm civets to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Bats are currently considered a reservoir for all human coronaviruses, as mentioned above [5, 71] . Many coronaviruses are circulating in animals but have not yet infected humans. The type of animal that SARS-CoV-2 originated from is still unclear. At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, many patients were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. After retrospectively studying case reports, the number of patients that did not have exposure to animal markets has risen, indicating person-to-person spread was also occurring at that time [66] . SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to bat coronaviruses and SARS-CoV [8] . A group of researchers reported early in the outbreak that the novel SARS-CoV-2 has the highest similarity of codon usage bias with snakes [72, 73] ; however, this method to determine initial host origins is dubious. Interestingly, researchers also reported one amino acid difference in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of Pangolin-CoV compared to that of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins might play a role as an intermediate host (Xiao et al., data currently under review). Another group of researchers reported that the virus originated from bats based on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, which is 96% identical to bat coronavirus RaTG13. There were speculations that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory-engineered CoV and leaked directly from a laboratory in Wuhan where a bat CoV (RaTG13) was recently reported. However, there is no evidence to support this allegation [74] . Recently, a group of researchers found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks but efficiently in ferrets and cats [75] . Scientists are still trying to find the main source of the disease outbreak and identify the definitive intermediate hosts.",

Some of SARS-CoV-2 patients have runny nose, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [84] . People can be infected without showing symptoms, which allows the virus to spread more effectively from person to person. Complications can occur due to COVID-19 leading to severe infections, such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs), kidney failure, and death [8] . The mild phase of the disease can last up to 2 weeks, while severe or critical disease lasts approximately 3 to 6 weeks (this analysis was conducted on 55,924 confirmed cases). Additionally, the time from the disease onset to the development of severe disease is one week, while the time from the onset of symptoms to death ranges from 2 to 8 weeks [82] .",

Using artificial intelligence models in the future may be useful in mass screening, to allow risk prioritization and help to minimize turnaround time [90] . Pan et al. [91] conducted a retrospective study to elaborate the time course of lung changes during recovery from infection. They described findings using international standard nomenclatures such as ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and crazy paving patterns. They established a semi-quantitative scoring system of 5 grades to quantify the degree of involvement based on an area ranging from 0% to >75%. The total score ranged from 0 to 25 (max), and involvement was subpleural, random, or diffuse. They found that in early stages (0-4 days after the onset of symptoms), GGO was the main finding in lower lung lobes; in progressive stages (5-8 days), the progression of lung disease involved three patterns of ground-glass, consolidation, and crazy paving, while in peak stages (9-13 days) , dense consolidation became the prevalent feature; in absorption stages (>14 days), GGO was detected with no crazy paving and resolution of consolidations [91] . More than 75% of SARS-CoV-2-affected patients suffered from bilateral lung involvement, and 71% have multilobe involvement. CT examinations of 21 patients showed 29% consolidation and 86% GGO in the chest [8, 9, 92, 93] . Another study examined 51 cases by CT and reported that 77% showed pure GGO, 75% exhibited GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickness, 59% had GGO with consolidation, while 55% revealed pure consolidation. Bilateral lung involvement was reported in 86% of cases; in 80% of the cases the posterior part of the lung was involved, while in 86%, the periphery was involved [94] .",

The use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids, IL-6 antagonist, janus kinase inhibitors (JAK), and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine in SARS-CoV-2 patients is a dilemma, especially in patients suffering from an impaired immune system. Balancing the risk-benefit ratio is a critical issue. Corticosteroids may delay the elimination of the virus and increase the risk of secondary infection. In addition, drugs targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines can only inhibit specific inflammatory factors and thus may not be very effective in curbing the cytokine storm (excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines). Moreover, some anti-inflammatory drugs such as JAK block INF-\u03b1 production, which is important in fighting the virus [102] .",

Why does the virus cause severe disease and mortality in the elderly or those with co-morbidities, while it is milder in children? Are aerosol, saliva, feces, urine, and foodborne the only routes of transmission? What are the other unknown routes of transmission?",

It is now a global pandemic, with 1,773,084 confirmed cases, 111,652 deaths, and 467,074 recoveries (as of 13 April 2020). The virus has the potential for rapid and extensive spread between people and countries. There are a lot of misleading information and knowledge gaps on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reviewed the latest updates about different aspects including epidemiology, source of infection, transmission dynamics, zoonotic potential, virus characteristics, and discovery of novel strategies for disease control to avoid spillover of infection in the future. Bats play an important role in the transmission of the infection to humans. Coronaviruses are genetically diverse and have a high tendency towards frequent genetic mutations and gene recombination, which increases the risk of interspecies transmission. Information about the incubation period can help in establishing an effective quarantine for asymptomatic carriers, thus preventing the virus spread. From our perspectives and based on the currently available information about the virus and its epidemiology, the control of the SARS-CoV-2 requires an effective and global disease coordination effort including multidisciplinary research efforts (One-Health approach) through collaboration between governments, epidemiologists, virologists, health authorities, veterinarians, and physicians. At this stage of the disease outbreak, developing vaccines is crucial to limit the spread of the infection.",
