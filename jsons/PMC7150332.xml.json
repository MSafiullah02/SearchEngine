Following transmission, the virus starts to multiply and after an incubation period clinical symptoms appear with simultaneous shedding of infectious virus. Virus-specific antibodies appear somewhat later (from some days to weeks, called a window period). When the virus-specific antibody production reaches the level of detection, at first immunoglobulin M(IgM) antibodies and some days later immunoglobulin G(IgG) antibodies appear, and the amount of infectious virus starts to decrease. If this is the first encounter with this particular virus, that is, a primary immune response, IgG antibody levels can stay at a relatively low level, whereas in a later contact with the same antigen, that is, in secondary response, IgG levels increase rapidly and reach high levels while IgM response may not be detectable at all. Antibodies are usually investigated from serum samples taken at acute and convalescent phase of the infection.

The double-stranded DNA is first heat-denaturated and separated into single strands. The specific target fragment of DNA strand is then amplified (Figure 3\n) by pairs of target-specific oligonucleotide primers, each of which hybridize to one strand of double-stranded DNA. The hybridized primers act as an origin for heat-stable polymerase enzyme and a complementary strand is synthesized via sequential addition of deoxyribonucleotides. After annealing of the primers, extension of the DNA fragment will start. These cycles are repeated 35\u201340 times, each cycle resulting in an exponentially increasing numbers of copies.",

Several kit applications for detecting viral nucleic acids and antigens or virus-specific antibodies already exist. Microarrays based on random PCR amplification can be used to detect a variety of viruses belonging to different families. Screening of some other infection markers can be also included in the same test format. Microarrays are not widely used for clinical purposes because of limited sensitivity and the difficulties of developing analytical instruments suitable for diagnostic laboratories. Another line of development is the increasing number of POC tests, which may form an important part of future diagnostic testing of infectious diseases.",
