Although this selection cannot be explained by any known viral infection, it may reflect antiviral response to some extinct highly deadly infection. Previously, we showed that transient transfection of an expression construct that generates IFN-\u03bb4 protein induced interferon signaling, with activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and generation of antiviral response in HepG2, a human hepatoma cell line (Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013). However, the function of IFN-\u03bb4 and its role in impaired HCV clearance remained unclear. Here, we further explored this question by performing additional functional analyses of IFN-\u03bb4 transiently and stably overexpressed in human hepatic cells\u2014fresh primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells.",

Cell-permeant Halo-tag ligands (TMR red or Oregon green; Promega) were added to live cells (1:2,000 for 15 min), and live imaging was performed using a LSM700 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) fitted with a temperature and CO2-controlled chamber. When applicable, nuclei were visualized using fluorescent Hoechst 33342 dye (Life Technologies). For cell death analysis, live cells were imaged using inverted oil lens at 40\u00d7 magnification, with 6 s scanning per minute per field of view for 18 h, generating 1,080 images per field; 6 fields were imaged in sequence using stage-positioning software. Each field of view had at least 10 transfected cells. Signs of cell death were scored visually by counting membrane rupture events in the videos representing the 18-h imaging periods.

High levels of IP-10 have been associated with inflammation and pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection (Harvey and others 2003; Lagging and others 2006). We measured the levels of IP-10 in culture media of PHHs and HepG2 transfected with different constructs. In PHHs, IP-10 was detectable in the media from samples transfected with IFNL4-Halo and IFNL3-Halo (Fig. 3B), while it was undetectable in HepG2 cells transfected with IFNL4-Halo (data not shown), in accordance with a much lower CXCL10 mRNA expression observed in HepG2 compared with PHHs (Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S3). Importantly, the \u03b1-IFN-\u03bb4 antibody added to the shared media strongly decreased mRNA expression of ISGs, including CXCL10, in nonexpressing transwell PHHs (Fig. 3A) and the amount of IP-10 secreted to the shared media (Fig. 3A, B).",

Cell rupture events over the course of 18 h of imaging were significantly more frequent in IFN-\u03bb4+ compared with control-Halo+ HepG2 cells (Fig. 5C). Flow cytometry analysis showed that necrotic cells (defined as Annexin V+ and Live/Dead+) were significantly more common in cells transfected with IFNL4-Halo compared with p131-Halo (a nonfunctional protein isoform of IFN-\u03bb4), IFNL3-Halo, and control-Halo constructs (Fig. 5D, E). Transfection efficiency was comparable for all these constructs (Fig. 5G, but could not be determined for the secreted IFNL3-Halo), and thus could not explain the observed differences in cell death. We also evaluated cell death in PHHs transiently transfected with IFNL4-Halo or control-Halo constructs. In general, in PHHs, cell death rates were very high even in untransfected cells and similar for both constructs (data not shown), possibly due to physiologically high baseline cell death rates in primary cells unrelated to the effect of IFN-\u03bb4.",

The \u03b1-IFN-\u03bb4 antibody treatment attenuated IFN-\u03bb4-induced cell death (Fig. 9A), while it increased proliferation (Fig. 9B) and improved cell viability (Fig. 9C). Since the antibody is not expected to enter the cells and can only block the secreted protein, these results indicate that the observed cell death and decreased viability and proliferation are caused by the secreted IFN-\u03bb4. Interestingly, this effect was localized to IFN-\u03bb4-expressing cells and was undetectable in nonexpressing bystander cells in the transwell assays (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, the effect of IFN-\u03bb4 may be concentration dependent and primarily affecting the IFN-\u03bb4-expressing cells.",

At this point, we are unable to determine the mechanism of IFN-\u03bb4-induced cell death. Although we did not detect activation of caspase-3 by IFN-\u03bb4, therapeutic anti-tumor mechanisms of interferons have been related to cell growth arrest and induction of caspase-3-independent apoptosis via the p53 pathway (Vogelstein and others 2000; Takaoka and others 2003; Takaoka and Taniguchi 2003), and this pathway should be tested for IFN-\u03bb4 as well. The effect of IFN-\u03bb4 on activation of interferon signaling and cell death might be complex and intertwined, and further studies are warranted.",

On the other hand, the increased pretreatment expression levels of these ISGs have been associated with refractoriness to IFN-\u03b1 therapy (Dill and others 2011), especially in carriers of the IFNL4-rs368234815-\u0394G or rs12979860-T alleles (Urban and others 2010; Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013). This could be because IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb4 compete for induction of the same set of ISGs, and, once activated by IFN-\u03bb4, these ISGs do not respond to IFN-\u03b1. The fact that despite having lower pretreatment HCV levels, individuals with rs368234815-\u0394G allele are more likely to develop chronic HCV and fail IFN-\u03b1-based treatment, suggests that either negative effects of IFN-\u03bb4 outweigh its positive effect on lowering HCV viral load or antiviral effects induced by IFN-\u03bb4 are insufficient for complete viral clearance.",

The observed effects might differ from the physiologic conditions in the HCV-infected hepatic cells in the complex whole-organ environment by the magnitude, duration, and efficiency of IFN-\u03bb4 induction. We also did not address the mechanism of intracellular retention and the function of the nonsecreted IFN-\u03bb4. However, we provide a comprehensive functional analysis of IFN-\u03bb4, a novel human interferon, and suggest its role in activation of interferon signaling, inhibition of cell proliferation, and induction of cell death in human hepatic cells.",
