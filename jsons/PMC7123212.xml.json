Current consensus acknowledges the occurrence of two opposite host reactions to severe infection with proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory features [2]. In sepsis, the normally careful inflammatory balance is disturbed, and hyperinflammation together with immune suppression ensue. This dysregulated immune response to infection is associated with a failure to return to homeostasis and harms the host, resulting in the life-threatening condition called sepsis [3]. While insights in the pathogenesis of sepsis have rapidly grown, this complex syndrome is not yet fully understood, and our increased understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying sepsis has thus far failed to improve health outcome. This chapter provides a brief overview of the pathogenesis of sepsis (Fig. 3.1).\n",

All invading microorganisms with a sufficient load and virulence can cause sepsis. However, several pathogens are well known for their impressive arsenal to attack the host. In a point-prevalence study entailing 14,000 intensive care unit (ICU) patients in 75 countries, 62% of positive isolates were gram-negative bacteria, versus 47% gram-positive and 19% fungal [4]. The most common gram-negative isolates in sepsis patients are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the most frequent gram-positive organisms are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae [5, 6]. The incidence of fungal infections as the cause of sepsis is rising, which is problematic due to the associated increased mortality. The most common site of infection is the respiratory tract with 63.5% of the culture-positive infections in the ICU, followed by abdominal infections (19.6%), bloodstream infections (15.1%), renal or urinary tract infections (14.3%), skin infections (6.6%), catheter-related infections (4.7%), infections of the central nervous system (2.9%), and others [4].",

            "text": "The host can recognize molecular components of invading pathogens, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), with specific receptors. Examples of key bacterial PAMPs are lipopolysaccharide (LPS, also known as endotoxin, a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria), peptidoglycan, lipopeptides (constituents of many pathogens), lipoteichoic acid (a cell wall component of gram-positive bacteria), flagellin (factor in the mobility of bacteria), and bacterial DNA [7]. In the early response to infection, pathogens or more specifically PAMPs are recognized by a limited number of specialized host receptors, known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRR-mediated pathogen recognition is an important defense mechanism of the host against invading pathogens and results in upregulation of inflammatory gene transcription and initiation of innate immunity [2, 7, 8]. However, if the innate immune system fails to eradicate the pathogen, overstimulation of PRRs by a growing bacterial load can result in dysregulation of the host response, which then no longer benefits the host but causes tissue injury, organ dysfunction, and progression to sepsis. A contributing factor herein is that PRRs can also be stimulated by endogenous molecules released by injured cells, so-called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs or alarmins) [9]. Examples of DAMPs are heat shock proteins, fibrinogen, hyaluronic acid, and high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1) [9]. Thus, PRRs recognize molecular components of both the pathogen (PAMPs) and the host (DAMPs), resulting in a vicious cycle and perpetuation of inflammation. Four main PRR families have been identified: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) [7, 8].",

They are expressed both extracellularly (TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6) and intracellularly (TLR3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) in endosomes and lysosomes. Ten different TLRs have so far been identified in humans (TLR1\u201310); 12 are found in mice (TRL1\u20139, TLR11, TLR12, TLR13) [10]. TLRs are activated by a broad range of ligands presented by bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, and the host itself. The signaling pathways of TLRs run via four adaptor proteins, namely, myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), TIR domain-containing adaptor protein-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF), and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM). This signaling eventually leads to the translocation of nuclear factor (NF-\u03baB) into the nucleus which starts the transcoding of genes and is crucial for early activation of the immune system [8]. As an example of TLR signaling, TLR4 is stimulated through its ligand LPS, the virulence factor of gram-negative bacteria. It activates both the MyD88- and the TIRAP-dependent pathways for early-phase activation of NF-\u03baB and results in late-phase activation of NF-\u03baB via the TRIF-dependent pathway [7]. TLR3 is stimulated by dsRNA derived from viruses or virus-infected cells and activates the TRIF-dependent pathway [8].",

A close collaboration between the complement system and other proinflammatory stimuli such as cytokines is necessary: the complement system tags dangerous cells or pathogens, and phagocytic cells can respond more properly after activation by proinflammatory mediators. This teamwork is dysregulated in sepsis resulting in inefficient use of the complement system. The complement system contributes directly to the activation of the immune system by the release of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Anaphylatoxins are proinflammatory molecules that activate surrounding cells when they reach a threshold concentration, can lead to the recruitment of other immune cells (macrophages, basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells), and can activate endothelial and epithelial cells and platelets [17, 18]. The harmful role of C5a in sepsis has been linked to neutrophil dysfunction, apoptosis of lymphoid cells, exacerbation of systemic inflammation, cardiomyopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and complications associated with multiple organ failure [19]. Several experimental sepsis studies have highlighted the beneficial effect of blockage of C5a signaling on outcome [20]. As such, C5a is considered a potential therapeutic target in sepsis.",

Coagulation abnormalities can range from mild to clinically relevant fulminant coagulopathies. DIC is the most severe manifestation of disturbed hemostasis with microvascular thrombosis and, through consumption of clotting factors and platelets, simultaneous hemorrhage [22]. The most important initiator of coagulation in sepsis is tissue factor (TF). Indeed, inhibition of TF prevents DIC and improves survival in experimental sepsis [21]. TF is predominantly produced by macrophages and monocytes, and its expression is enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines, exemplifying the close interaction between inflammation and coagulation [23]. Furthermore, TF can reside in micro particles that are formed by hematopoietic and endothelial cells. These micro particles play a significant role in both coagulation and inflammation [24].",

The physiological function of the protein C system has been supported by investigations in which interventions inhibiting this pathway resulted in severe coagulopathy and death in otherwise nonlethal infection models. During the early stages of inflammation, plasminogen activators are released to help break down fibrin.

In healthy hosts endothelium generates APC from protein C through an interaction between thrombin and thrombomodulin (a receptor expressed by endothelial cells); formation of APC by the thrombomodulin-thrombin complex is accelerated by the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). APC inactivates coagulation cofactors Va and VIIIa by proteolysis, thereby inhibiting coagulation.

In sepsis there is a relative deficiency of ADAMTS13 leading to ultra-large von Willebrand multimers at injured sites, contributing to overwhelming platelet adhesion and microvascular thrombosis and possibly eventually multiple organ dysfunction.

During sepsis massive apoptosis leads to depletion of immune cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B cells. This depletion is seen in lymphoid organs and body sites, such as the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue [36, 39]. T regulatory (Treg) cells are more resistant to sepsis-induced apoptosis which, combined with the substantial apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B cells, lead to a more immune suppressive phenotype. Furthermore, surviving CD4+ and CD8+ T cells shift from a Th1 proinflammatory phenotype to the more immune suppressive Th2 phenotype. Inhibition of lymphocyte apoptosis was associated with better outcomes in various experimental sepsis models, suggesting a causal relationship between lymphocyte apoptosis and sepsis mortality [2, 36]. A recently identified potential therapeutic target in sepsis is the programmed cell death 1 (PD1)\u2013PD1 ligand (PDL1) pathway. Patients with sepsis showed enhanced expression of PD1 on CD4+ T cells together with increased expression of PDL1 on macrophages and endothelial cells [39]. Enhanced PD1\u2013PDL1 interaction is expected to impair T-cell function, and in mice inhibition of this pathway conferred protection against lethality following experimentally induced sepsis [40]. Clinical trials seeking to inhibit PD1\u2013PDL1 signaling in sepsis patients are under way.",

            "text": "Epigenetic regulation of gene function likely plays a significant role in the host response to infection through suppression of proinflammatory gene expression and/or activation of anti-inflammatory genes, thereby contributing to immune suppression [41]. Protein expression can be regulated both at the pre- and posttranscriptional level. Pretranscriptional regulation takes place on chromatin, the complex formed by the DNA double helix packaged by histones. The gene loci on chromatin can be organized in transcriptionally active \u201ceuchromatin\u201d or transcriptionally silent \u201cheterochromatin.\u201d The chromatin activation state is regulated by histone modifications due to acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation. For example, acetylation of lysine residues within histones usually facilitates transcription [41]. \u201cEndotoxin tolerance\u201d in monocytes has been linked to reduced expression of marks of open chromatin such as histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) [42], and \u201cendotoxin tolerant\u201d macrophages showed enhanced levels of the repressive histone modification H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9m2) at the promoter sites of the genes encoding the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1\u03b2 [43]. One mechanism by which microbial stimuli induce epigenetic gene regulation is through increased expression of the histone lysine demethylase KDM6B via NF-\u03baB activation [44]. KDM6B primes genes for transcription, and it is postulated that this promotes IL-4 maturation. The latter is a potent cytokine to counteract various proinflammatory cytokines and contributes to immune suppression. This IL-4/KDM6B axis appears to be one of the important pathways in the epigenetic regulation of macrophage activation [41]. The immune suppressive effects of sepsis can remain for months, perhaps even longer. It is hypothesized that epigenetic imprints occur both on mature immune cells in the periphery and progenitor cells in the bone marrow, thereby contributing to this long-lasting immune suppression [41].",

A shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (the so-called Warburg effect) is important for cells to generate an inflammatory response upon stimulation by LPS, and a failure to do so may render cells relatively unresponsive. As such, a disturbed balance in cellular metabolic processes has been implicated in the altered phenotype of monocytes in sepsis, although the underlying mechanisms seem to be more intricate than mere shifts between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. In contrast to LPS (which induces a classical Warburg effect), other bacterial stimuli were found to induce a rise in both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in monocytes [46]. Similarly, the deficits of monocyte metabolism in sepsis patients with immune suppression do not only involve glycolysis but include a broad inhibition of metabolic processes including glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation [47].",

The normally careful inflammatory balance is disturbed, and this dysregulation is associated with a failure to return to homeostasis. Hyperinflammation and immune suppression ensue, to an extent that is detrimental to the host. (b) Once a pathogen has succeeded to cross the mucosal barrier of the host, it can cause sepsis depending on its load and virulence. The host defense system can recognize molecular components of invading pathogens (PAMPs) with specialized receptors (PRRs). Stimulation of PRRs has proinflammatory and immune suppressive consequences. It leads to activation of target genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines (leukocyte activation), inefficient use of the complement system, activation of the coagulation system, and concurrent downregulation of anticoagulant mechanisms and necrotic cell death. This starts a vicious cycle with further progression to sepsis, due to the release of endogenous molecules by injured cells (DAMPs or alarmins), which can further stimulate PRRs. Immune suppression is characterized by massive apoptosis and thereby depletion of immune cells, reprogramming of monocytes and macrophages to a state of a decreased capacity to release proinflammatory cytokines and a disturbed balance in cellular metabolic processes. (c) Sepsis is by definition a disease with organ failure. The clinical manifestation can be heterogeneous. Clinicians use physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging techniques to determine the severity and origin of organ failure. Antimicrobial treatment is aimed to eliminate the causative pathogen, where supportive care is aimed to restore organ function.
