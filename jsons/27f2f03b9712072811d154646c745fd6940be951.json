Importantly, despite generally lower air pollution concentrations, the High-income super region had the highest share of total economic cost borne by the elderly population (from 67% to 72%), followed by the Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia super regions (from 56% to 60%). In comparison, given its much younger age distribution, only 24% of the total cost in the Sub-Saharan Africa super region was borne by the older population. The share of the health economic cost on the older population increased over time in most countries due to rapid population ageing ( Figures 2C  & 2D ). The proportion of economic cost related to the older population was higher in countries with relatively lower population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations as there was an overall negative correlation between PM2.5 levels and the national proportion of those older than 60 years (Appendix Figure 3a) . For example, Japan experienced the highest proportion of the health economic cost (from 70% to 83%) in the elderly from 2000 to 2016, followed by Italy (from 76% to 81%), Spain (from 71% to 77%) and Germany (from 70% to 76%) where the population weighted PM2.5 concentration was under 20 \u00b5g/m 3 .",

We decomposed the change in health cost attributable to ambient PM2.5 pollution from 2000 to 2016 by country and region into five major contributors-population growth, population ageing, age-specific mortality, the exposure level of ambient PM2.5 and the growth of GDP per capita (see appendix for detail method, pp 2-3). Globally, the effects of population ageing offset 52% of the benefits gained from mortality reduction over the 17-year period. Figure 5 shows the relative and absolute contribution of the five driving factors of the rise in the health cost of ambient PM2.5 in the total population ( Figure  5A ) and the older population ( Figure 5B ) in the GBD super regions. Among all driving factors, the increase in GDP per capita was the dominant contributor to the rapid growth of health cost over the study period in the South-East Asian regions ( Figure 5A-5B ). In the High-income super region, the change in age-specific mortality played a key role in reducing the health cost, lowering it by 28.5% between 2000 and 2016 ( Figure 5A ). However, the growth of health cost due to population ageing offset 90% of the benefits of avoided deaths due to the reduction of mortality in the High-income super region ( Figure 5A ).

This substantial variation was mainly due to differences in GDP per capita and annual PM2.5 concentration across countries worldwide. In 2016, the global health economic cost estimated by country-specific valuation measures (i.e., constant VSL, age-adjusted VSL, constant VSLY and age-adjusted VSLY) peaked at regions with PM2.5 concentrations of 14.5 \u00b5g/m 3 (Figures 6A, 6B, 6D, 6E ). Applying these four valuation measures, we also found that 50% of global health economic cost occurred in regions where PM2.5 was below 25 \u00b5g/m 3 . In contrast, if a global average age-adjusted VSLY measure is applied, half of the all-age health economic cost occurred in regions where ambient PM2.5 was below 41.5 \u00b5g/m 3 . For the constant VSL, the share of economic cost among the ageing population was 77%, while the share dropped to 60% when the age-adjusted VSL was used. In comparison, the older population's share of economic costs was 61% and 59% when we applied an age-invariant VSLY and an age-specific VSLY, respectively. Figure 5a (in appendix pp 6) shows that the United States, Japan and Russia, where a VSL was relatively higher due to the higher GDP per capita, had the highest health cost among the regions with PM2.5 levels below 25 \u00b5g/m 3 . In contrast, China and India had the highest health costs in the regions where annual PM2.5 was 25 \u00b5g/m 3 to 125 \u00b5g/m 3 , whereas these countries had a relatively lower VSL.",

Compared with an age-invariant VSL, which is used in most previous studies, the health economic cost of PM2.5 pollution using an age-adjusted VSLY measure considers three major effects that influence VSLY over one's lifetime: the change of remaining life expectancy, life quality and wealth weights. After the adjustment of VSLY by age, we obtained a set of VSL estimates that varied with age in an inverted-U shape that peaks at 40-50 years old (appendix pp 11), which is consistent with previous studies. Shepard and Zeckhauser (1984) illustrated in a \"Robinson Crusoe\" analysis that VSL increases with age among young adults, peaks at age 40, and then continuously drops when they get older.

            "text": "Despite the advancements to estimating the health cost of air pollution made in this study, limitations remain. First, we applied methods that require a series of global and historical data inputs, which are measured with uncertainty. Although the satellite-based estimates are generally somewhat lower than the ground monitoring data, the PM2.5 estimates used in this study show a highly consistency (R 2 =0.81) with ground measurements. 61 In addition, uncertainties in the population spatial distribution typically increase by the disaggregation of the age categories. Second, the exposure-response functions applied in this study also introduced uncertainties. Our estimates of economic costs caused by NCD+LRI were 40% higher than the total of five specific diseases in the older population using the GEMM. Due to the limited number of available cohort studies, the GEMM assumes that the prevalence of deaths for the additional causes, such as chronic kidney disease and dementia, 62, 63 is similar in all countries compared to the countries that are included in the 41 cohort studies. Including more cohort studies from highly-polluted countries and additional exposure-response functions for other NCDs in the GEMM will reduce the uncertainties in the estimates of deaths attributable to PM2.5 pollution. We also suggest that the exposure-response relationships of other NCDs should be further investigated to improve the estimates of health cost in additional NCDs. For example, the 2017 GBD Study included type 2 diabetes as another specific cause of disease, while the 2019 GBD study incorporated the estimates of deaths mediated by the impact of air pollution on birthweight and short gestation. Adding additional causes of disease related to PM2.5 might reduce the share of the health impacts of the older population relative to the total impact over all ages. In addition, as the GEMM is based on adult cohort mortality analyses, it may underestimate the overall impact of air pollution and specifically impacts on infant mortality and morbidity impacts on younger age groups. 64 Third, uncertainties embedded in the age-adjusted VSLY. We translated the VSL or VSLY of all countries worldwide based on the VSL database of OECD countries, because national studies are limited. However, this database might underestimate the VSL in the United States and even other higher-income countries. For example, Viscusi (2018) estimated that the VSL in the US is US$10 million based on a hedonic wage approach, which is much higher than the benefit-transfer estimate (US$ 4.5 million in the US) used in this study. If we adopt a VSL of US$ 10 million in the US, the health cost of PM2.5 in the US will be US$1.02 trillion (0.81, 1.22). Estimates of the income elasticity for VSL also varies across countries. Therefore, a benefit-transfer method induces uncertainties in VSL and VSLY estimates in countries. In this study, we applied an ageinvariant value of income elasticity within two groups of countries: low-income and highincome countries. To limit these uncertainties, we considered a wide range of elasticities between 0.6 and 1.4, which covers the estimates of elasticity reported in most previous studies. 40, 44 We acknowledge that elasticities are different across countries, but we believe our uncertainty assessment captured most of the bias caused by the variation of income elasticity in the VSL estimates. To adjust VSLY by age, we adopted a global average wealth weights by age due to limited statistical data at national level. More country-level wealth data by age will improve the robustness of the estimates in this study.",

The health economic cost estimated by the age-adjusted VSLY measure provides further information for national and local government to design pollution control strategies and allocate healthcare resources by populations' ages. Additional non-communicable disease, not previously considered, represent a large share of the total health economic costs, thus the benefits of pollution reduction might exceed previous estimates. If substantial pollution reduction, especially in highly-polluted and highly-aged countries, is not achieved, ambient air pollution will lead to rapid increases in health economic cost related to mortality, which might induce substantial burden on national healthcare systems. In addition, improved health care targeted towards older individuals and providing opportunities to reduce exposures can be helpful to reduce the health cost of ambient air pollution. Given that many of the measures that will protect people from air pollution are the same ones necessary to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, this study provides a rationale for measures that will improve health across generations through both improved air quality and reduced health impacts related to climate change as the century progresses.",

Although the wealth of people at old age decreased slightly, it remains to be higher than most of the younger age population. Correlation between population ageing and PM2.5 concentration We regressed the population ageing rates (proportion of population aged 60 years and older over the total population) with population-weighted PM2.5 concentration using a generalized additive model. Figure 3a shows that the ageing rates decreased continuously with an increase of population-weighed PM2.5 concentration, which represents an overall decreasing trend of population ageing with an incremental population weighted PM2.5 concentration. 8. Health economic cost distribution with PM2.5 concentration Figure 5a indicates the dramatic difference of health economic burden distribution with PM2.5 concentration by selected countries and the rest of the world. For high-income countries, such as the United States, Japan and Russia, the health cost mainly incurred in regions with PM2.5 concentrations below 25 \u00b5g/m 3 . By contrast, China and India suffered major economic loss with pollution concentrations between 25 \u00b5g/m 3 and 100 \u00b5g/m 3 .",

The lower-middle income countries suffered the highest premature deaths and YLLs, whereas the health economic cost related to such health impacts were lower than the loss in high-income countries.

The Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania region suffered 49% of global costs caused by COPD, followed by South Asia where it accounted for 21%. For lung cancer, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania and high-income regions experienced 47% and 36% of global health costs. High-income regions accounted for the highest proportion of total health costs caused by NCD-LRI and LRI. Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania suffered the largest proportion of global health economic cost due to lung cancer, stroke and COPD. 11. Cumulative health economic cost by valuation measure Figure 10a illustrates the cumulative health economic burden distribution with respect to PM2.5 concentrations using five valuation measures. The age-invariant measure generates the highest estimates of economic cost related to PM2.5 pollution. With a global average age-adjusted VSLY measure, the estimates of economic burden grew substantially compared with country-& age-adjusted VSLY measure, which indicates that the most health damage happened in lower income countries.

Cumulative health economic cost variations by age and measure To further compare the differences in estimates, we disaggregated the health economic burden distribution by different age groups using five valuation measures. It shows that the economic burden difference among the population younger than 60 years old was relatively consistent. However, the gap became larger at 60 and older, and especially large above 85. Specifically, the health economic burden valued by age-invariant VSL was 4.3 times the loss estimated by age-adjusted VSLY on the population aged 85 and higher. Figure 11a The comparison of cumulative economic burden distribution with PM2.5 concentration by age using five valuation measures. Figure 12a illustrates the effect of age on VSL over a life cycle period. In the age-adjusted VSL/VSLY measures, there were two inverted U-shape patterns after 20 years old, which shows that the VSL peaked at 40-50 years old (Figure 11a) , which is consistent with previous studies 4 . Since people younger than 20 years old generally have little cumulative wealth and there is no such data available for the analysis, we assumed the wealth weights are similar to their parents' wealth weights. For example, the wealth weight for people at 0-5 years old matched with wealth data of their parents aged around 25-30 years old. Therefore, the inverted U-shape pattern before 20 years old is due to the inverted relationship between age and VSL in the population at working age. Many empirical wagerisk studies revealed an inverted U-shaped pattern of age-VSL relationship 5, 6 . However, the hedonic wage models only revealed the WTP for mortality risk reduction during one's working age, i.e., in a rough range of 18 to 62 years old 4 . Due to limited studies reported the age-VSL relationship for people under 20 years old, we assumed that people under 20 years old have the same wealth as that of their parents. ",

Unlike previous studies that adopted an age-165invariant VSL or VSLY to estimate the health cost of air pollution, we developed an age-166 adjusted measure of VSLY that incorporates the effects of variations in life expectancy, wealth 167distribution and life quality over the lifecycle. By accounting for these factors, our 168 methodology provides an improved measure for the value of mortality abatement. Additionally, 169we used the global exposure mortality model (GEMM) to describe the relationship between 170 pollution exposure and mortality. Compared to prior studies that apply integrated exposure-Given general trends in population aging, our results suggest that the economic 184 health costs of ambient air pollution will continue to rise in the immediate future. Although air 185 quality management is needed globally, it is especially urgent for highly-polluted and highly-186 aged countries. In addition, targeting health care and preventative interventions towards older 187 individuals, such as by providing them with at-home air filtration systems, can partially 188 mitigate the health costs of ambient air pollution. Understanding the health effects of air 189 pollution across the age distribution has important implications for assessing the aggregate 190costs of other age-differential health risks, such as the outbreak of COVID-19. Since the 191 outbreak is particularly dangerous for the elderly with preexisting health conditions, air 192 pollution might exaggerate the health risks of the epidemic. The methodology developed in 193 this study is applicable for evaluating the health economic costs of the epidemic. Further 194 investigation on the indirect health cost of COVID-19 due to the previous exposure of air 195 pollution might provide more incentives for air pollution control.",
