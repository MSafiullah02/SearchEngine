The elevation of CRP in isolation or in combination with other markers may reveal bacterial or viral infections. Our study explored the relationship between CRP and COVID-19 and found that patients with CRP > 41.8 mg/L were more likely to develop severe disease.",

PCT levels are increased by bacterial infections and relatively low with viral infections and, therefore, can be used to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections [16]. The higher PCT levels in the SG suggest that severe COVID-19 patients may have concomitant bacterial infections. It should be noted that the optimal cut-off value of PCT was 0.07 ng/mL and did not exceed the normal range (0\u20130.5 ng/mL), and this result may be due to the small sample size (eight patients). Therefore, the validity of PCT as an independent factor to predict the severity of COVID-19 needs to be further studied using a larger sample size.",
