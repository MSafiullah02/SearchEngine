Pan et al analyzed the epidemiological features of HPIV infection in 1,229 cases with severe acute respiratory infection in Beijing and found the highest yield rate in children under 5 years old. 3 Outbreaks of HPIV in household, nursing home, and daycare facilities have been described.

Methods Suspected cases were the children with an influenza-like illness during June 20 to 26, 2018. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and screened to determine the presence of respiratory pathogens by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The HN and F gene sequences of HPIV-positive samples were further amplified and sequenced to confirm the HPIV genotype and identify genetic characteristics. A phylogenetic tree, based on the HN and F genes, was reconstructed by maximum likelihood method. Results Fourteen children in the outbreak were diagnosed as upper respiratory tract infection. The most common symptom was cough (10/14), followed by rhinorrhea (5/14), sore throat (4/14), headache (1/14), and abdominal pain (1/14) . Eight patients were positive for HPIV1 and negative for other pathogens. Phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the eight strains from the year 2018 in our study located in the clade 2.3. Two specific substitutions (N333S and I509M) in the amino acids of the F protein and two substitutions (V19A and L436I) in the HN protein were different from other strains in the clade 2. Conclusion HPIV1 was attributed to the outbreak, which may be related to the genetic variations of HPIV1.",

All the pediatric patients went to hospital at the day of disease onset and 12 pediatric patients were diagnosed with URTI and 1 was diagnosed as URTI with tonsillitis. Detailed information about the pediatric patients is shown in \u25baTable 1. There were six boys and eight girls. All the patients had a maximum temperature of !37.5\u00b0C and 10 had a fever of !38.0\u00b0C. The most common symptoms were cough (10/14), followed by rhinorrhea (5/14), sore throat (4/ 14), headache (1/14), and abdominal pain (1/14). Among the 10 patients who had full blood counts performed, the white blood cell count was normal (4-10 \u00c2 10 9 /L) in five, high (!10 \u00c2 10 9 /L) in three, and low (<4 \u00c2 10 9 /L) in two.

We observed two specific substitutions in the amino acids of the F protein and HN protein, respectively, which revealed genetic variability. 18 This strain caused the out-break that may be related to the genetic variations of the strain from other strains. Whether the outbreak is associated with the four specific substitutions at these sites requires further study. From the phylogenetic tree of HPIV1 based on the complete HN and F gene, the HPIV1 sequences revealed the temporal characteristic. Meanwhile, the spatial spread may lead to the disorder in the temporal clusters, such as the eight strains in 2018 from our study located in the clade 2.3. In the same cluster, the sequences also revealed the spatial characteristic. However, we did not get the strains from China in GenBank.
