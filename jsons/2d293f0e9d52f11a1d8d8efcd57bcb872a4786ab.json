The aims of these recommendations are to outline: (1) essential practical steps to approaching procedures, as well as outpatient and inpatient care of EP patients, with relevant examples, (2) successful strategies to minimize exposure risk to patients and clinical staff while also balancing resource utilization, (3) challenges related to redeployment and restructuring of clinical and support staff, and (4) considerations regarding continued collaboration with clinical and administrative colleagues to implement these changes.

The exponentially rising New York City COVID-19 caseload and the preceding experiences in China, Italy, and Washington state demonstrated a stark reminder that a catastrophe like a pandemic may potentially overwhelm even the most advanced health systems. In 2009, during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the Institute of Medicine detailed \"crisis standards of care,\" defined as a \"substantial change in the usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver\u2026 justified by specific circumstances and\u2026 in recognition that crisis operations will be in effect for a sustained period.\" 1 All medical departments in New York City instituted their respective crisis and contingency protocols while trying to maintain the highest possible quality of care for the upcoming months. In Lombardy, Italy, the unique organizational issues of an interventional cardiology department in treating patients during the pandemic crisis were recently described, including recommendations for patient riskstratification, cardiologist team reassignment, interhospital collaboration, and safety considerations. 2 With regard to electrophysiology (EP) services, the surge in COVID-19 activity in New York City presented multiple challenges, requiring considerable \"ramp down\" and structural reorganization specific to the field of EP, as many services do not remain idle during this time period. We describe the changes in usual operations implemented in our 4 dedicated EP laboratory sections across the NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) enterprise (i.e., Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medical Center, Queens, and Brooklyn Methodist Hospital).",

To meet these demands, one goal of the network has been to increase intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity from a baseline of approximately 400 ICU beds to over 1000 ICU beds, a herculean task requiring a complete transformation of all hospital resources, including staff duties and physical plant.

Patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) have been to date managed medically, usually with amiodarone (and in many cases as outpatients with frequent follow-up, as described below).

A surgical mask is placed on all patients, and if a patient's respiratory status is in question or tenuous before a procedure, then consideration of endotracheal intubation is discussed before patient transport to minimize aerosolization risk in the lab. N95 masks are used by operating physicians for all cases. As many anesthesia teams have been redeployed to assist with central lines and intubations, conscious sedation administered by the EP MD (with backup anesthesia services) is utilized if felt to be a reasonable option that does not compromise patient safety.",

            "text": "\u2022 Each patient's televisit capabilities must be assessed. Some patients may not be technologically adept, or not have access to a smartphone, laptop, WiFi, or e-mail. Although a telephonebased evaluation is not reimbursed at this time, we have found it is still an effective way to provide care to anxious patients who are unable to access telehealth in other ways. We have found that the following basic telemedicine \"pearls\" help smoothen the experience for patient and caregiver: \u2022 Communicate an exact time when the patient should log in to prevent miscommunication. Remind patients that providers may be late to calls, and to please allow for a certain time period to lapse before logging off. \u2022 Consider enlisting family members to assist patients requiring technical help to initiate or complete a visit. \u2022 When speaking to the patient, look directly into the camera on your computer to simulate eye contact. Explain to the patient that if you look away, it is to take notes. \u2022 Ensure appropriate lighting is present in the physician's home \"office\" space. \u2022 Patients transmitting remotely who were coming for an annual visit were rescheduled for a time in the distant future with continued remote monitoring; patients who had remote monitoring-capable devices but were not enrolled were called by an MD or NP and encouraged to enroll, and a remote monitor was sent to them; patients with devices incapable of remote monitoring were scheduled for an outpatient session in the future, with timing dependent on prior history, including estimation of battery life. \u2022 Postprocedure \"wound care\" follow-up has been accomplished through a dedicated, staffed e-mail address where patients may send photos of their wound site. Rapid provision and in-servicing in the use of remote home interrogators is imperative, as patients can send remote downloads from their home monitors to serve as postprocedure interrogations. \u2022 Apple watch, Kardia recordings, and mailed Holters and patch monitors have been used to assess for arrhythmias and to follow the QT interval. 6 Remote ECG transmissions have been useful to document exacerbations of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, in otherwise stable outpatients, as well as provide reassurance to those patients with heightened anxiety in general during the COVID-19 crisis. \u2022 When higher-risk patients are seen in person, the EP administrative staff is informed. A screening for COVID-19 symptoms must be performed before the visit. If possible, efforts should be made to have the consult at a less utilized \"off-site\" away from the hospital. At least one hospital has transitioned all outpatient visits off-site, as this option was felt to minimize exposure risk to outpatients (versus a facility with a high percentage of COVID+ patients). \u2022 Examples of patients who had in-person appointments during the COVID-19 surge in our system include assessments for patients with a concern for radiation skin injury after prolonged biventricular device placement, poor wound-healing in a device patient that required cleaning and adhesive, a thorough device interrogation in a PPM-dependent patient with a question of RV lead integrity, and an ICD interrogation for a patient with a lead conduction fracture and increasing episodic noise. \u2022 Lastly, it is an enormous challenge to manage patients who are shocked by their ICD at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. In our experience, due to patient reluctance and/or limited availability of ED and inpatient resources, cases ordinarily managed with ED visits/admissions or direct admissions may not be possible. To date, of 4 patients with multiple ICD shocks due to VT, all were medically managed after presenting to the ED for assessment of vitals and baseline laboratory testing and released home with careful follow-up, without inpatient admission. Examples include: \u2022 A patient with history of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and a subcutaneous ICD received 3 successive shocks for monomorphic VT. He was advised to take an extra dose of carvedilol and was transported by ambulance to a local ED, where he received an intravenous amiodarone load and was discharged on oral amiodarone 24 hours later without recurrent events, with plan to follow-up at a later date, as medical resources allow. \u2022 A patient with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and a single lead ICD was brought to a network hospital site after receiving 7 shocks for monomorphic VT in the ventricular fibrillation zone in the setting of medication noncompliance. He received intravenous amiodarone 150 mg bolus and 6 hours of an infusion at 1 mg/min before being discharged on metoprolol and oral amiodarone load. \u2022 MD scheduling: Given the dramatic decrease in EP-centered patient volume, each on-call physician is involved in direct patient care at each hospital. As mentioned above, one attending performs procedures alone, with a backup physician available for assistance if needed. This system allowed for the flexibility of physician staff to continue to attend to their prescheduled responsibilities, including outpatient telehealth visits and inpatient rounding within the Cardiology division, and to record staff available for possible redeployment. \u2022 Contingency Planning for Deployment and Illness: Continuous flexibility regarding the rotation of MD staff should be maintained to adjust for physicians who fall ill or are redeployed in other areas of the hospital system, including ready availability of staff. 7 \u2022 Internal Redeployment: Providers and staff (physicians included) with patient-facing duties who have relevant medical comorbidities, and/or older age have been redeployed to nonpatient-facing duties, 8 including -Covering inpatient as well as outpatient remote televisits, including for colleagues who have been redeployed -Talking to patient families over the phone who are unable to be physically with their loved ones in the hospital -Fielding overnight and weekend calls to relieve inpatient-based colleagues -Curbside consultations with junior EP staff members -Continuing teaching duties of trainees when appropriate -Administrative scheduling (i.e., to see patients remotely, talk with patients' families).",
