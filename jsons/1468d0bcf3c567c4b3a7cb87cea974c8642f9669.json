With multiple carbohydrate-recognition domains, it is able to bind to sugar groups displayed on the surfaces of a wide range of microorganisms and thereby provide first-line defence. Importantly, it also activates the complement system through a distinctive third pathway, independent of both antibody and the C1 complex. Three single point mutations in exon 1 of the expressed human MBL-2 gene appear to impair the generation of functional oligomers. Such deficiencies of functional protein are common in certain populations, e.g. in sub-Saharan Africa, but virtually absent in others, e.g. indigenous Australians. MBL disease association studies have been a fruitful area of research and implicate a role for MBL in infective, inflammatory and autoimmune disease processes. Overall, there appears to be a genetic balance in which individuals generally benefit from high levels of the protein. However, in certain situations, reduced levels of circulating MBL may be beneficial to the host and this may explain the persistence of the deleterious gene polymorphisms in many population groups.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "It is now 60 years since the Australian Nobel prize winner Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, together with John McCrea, identified three inhibitors in serum (called a, b and g), which were able to inactivate influenza virus (1) .

During the past 30 years, our understanding of this protein has steadily increased as a result of extensive research activity in three main areas: (a) bio/immunochemistry (including molecular genetics), (b) microbiology and (c) immunodeficiency. Work in these areas initially proceeded independently as evidence for both an inexplicable biological function and a clinical deficiency state emerged. The isolation and characterization of the protein were necessary in order to illuminate the observations of the so-called RaRf bactericidal activity (3, 4) in the microbiology area and the opsonic deficiency reported in many paediatric populations.

Three polypeptide chains form a triple helix within the collagenous region, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and interchain disulphide bonds within the N-terminal cysteine-rich region. This is the basic building block of all circulating molecular forms of MBL. In serum, MBL consists of oligomers ranging from dimers to hexamers, and X-ray crystallographic studies/electron micrographs have revealed that these oligomers have a sertiform or a bouquetlike structure due to an interruption in the collagenous region, giving rise to a kink/hinge. The ability of the protein to bind effectively to microorganisms and activate complement appears to depend on the presence of higher order oligomers (tetramers and above). Work by Drickamer and colleagues (10, 11) and also by Ezekowitz and colleagues (12) has provided an insight into the structure of the CRD. Each CRD binds a calcium ion, enabling it to form co-ordination bonds with the 3-and 4-hydroxyl groups of specific sugars including mannose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, N-acetyl-mannosamine, fucose and glucose. The three CRDs in each structural subunit are separated by a constant 45-\u00c5 distance (12) . Clustering of the structural subunits provides a flat platform, permitting binding of MBL to the arrays of repeating sugar groups on microbial surfaces.

Since the structure of the virus was rapidly established (73, 74) , it also became clear that this novel infectious agent was rich in the sugars known to be targeted by MBL and it was hypothesized that this lectin might well be involved in first-line defence against this infection. Subsequent studies found significant differences in the distribution of MBL-deficient genotypes in patients with SARS compared with those in controls (75, 76) . These studies suggested that MBL plays a role in susceptibility to the infection but does not influence subsequent severity. In their investigations, Ip et al. were also able to demonstrate binding of MBL to the virus and its ability to inhibit infection (75) . (77). The B variant allele was found more commonly in patients with symptomatic hepatitis B cirrhosis and in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Screening for MBL mutations in such patients was suggested in order to enable identification of those at increased risk of complications who may benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment.

More recently, the introduction of antibiotics, the emergence of novel infections and increasing use of immunosuppressive therapies have provided new challenges to our innate host defence system. Despite all these changing evolutionary pressures, MBL gene polymorphisms persist at high frequencies, suggesting that they offer potential advantages to the host.
