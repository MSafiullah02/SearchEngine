            "text": "Medication management for elderly patients is a critical component in the efficacy of the treatment modality. The process is complicated when a number of medicines are given, and the elderly patients have to manage the task of remembering the doses, which is quite taxing. This is further complicated if the patient is suffering from physical, visual, or cognitive impairments. Furthermore, it has been observed that even the elderly patients are advised oral drug delivery systems, which they have to swallow. Unfortunately, many of the patients (especially having age >70 years) suffer from dysphagia and face a tremendous obstacle in taking the medication. Regular use of the injectables in these patients is also not feasible. Due to the aforesaid reasons, the help of caregivers has been proposed. Nevertheless, this is associated with a high recurring cost. Many researchers have proposed to deliver drugs by applying the drug formulations over the skin surface [1]. The iontophoretic drug delivery system is one such method that has gained much importance in the last few decades. The main advantage of iontophoretic drug delivery is its ability to deliver drugs within the deeper layer of the skin tissue and/or systemic circulation in a noninvasive manner [2]. With the advent of technological advancements, it is quite feasible to develop electronically-controlled drug delivery systems, including iontophoretic drug delivery systems, at a cheap price.",

            "text": "The use of the internet for manipulating various machines, devices, and objects is known as the internet-of-things (IoT). Due to the significant advancements made in the field of internet technology, IoT has been able to revolutionize the current day technology system. In recent times, the term medical-IoT has been gaining importance. Medical-IoT is a field of study that involves controlling medical devices from a remote location using the internet technology. The application of IoT technology in medicine can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare service, especially for elderly patients, patients with chronic conditions, and for the people who need continuous monitoring [3]. This technology has also been explored for iontophoretic drug delivery applications. This type of device can help in monitoring and delivering the drug from a remote location (like office and car) by the relatives. Sayeed et al. developed an IoT-based responsive drug delivery system that can inject the drug into the epileptogenic zone on seizure detection [4]. In another study, Junginger et al. have designed a chip-controlled iontophoretic system that can deliver apomorphine to the patients suffering from Parkinson's disease [5]. In the proposed method, the amount of the drug delivered could be controlled by controlling the current density. Conformal contact between the device and the skin must exist to increase the device efficacy [6]. Any loss in the connection between the skin and the patch(es) results in the under-dosing of the drugs to the patients and can cause morbidity. However, to the best of our knowledge, no arrangement was made by any existing literature to detect the loss of connection between the skin and the patches. Another critical issue found in every drug delivery system was its ability to deliver only one drug at a time. The report says elderly people are the largest per capita consumer of drugs and are prescribed a higher number of medications [7]. In such patients, polypharmacy (multiple drug use) is mainly related to chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and memory-related diseases (e.g., dementia and Alzheimer's disease). Polypharmacy is also found in low-income countries where disease like tuberculosis is among the most common chronic illness [7]. Hence, a single-channel system may not be sufficient, and the requirement of a multichannel iontophoretic drug delivery system becomes essential.",

Some modifications were made in the circuits to suit our needs. The sinusoidal signal generator, which was developed using the Arduino Due, was used as the voltage signal generator. The output of the signal generator was processed using a passive high-pass filter (fc = 15 Hz). The output signal from the high-pass filter was then used as the input for the operational amplifier (OP-AMP) based voltage buffer circuit. The output of the buffer was later converted into a current signal using a voltage-to-current converter. The arrangements were made so that the generated current was then injected through the iontophoresis cell. An LED-based visual indicator circuit was also incorporated to indicate the working status of the device. All the OP-AMP were powered using a \u00b19 V battery-powered power supply (see Fig. S1 available in the Supplemental Materials on the ASME Digital Collection).

The noninverting terminal of the comparator was supplied with a +2.5 V DC voltage. The output of the comparator was then digitized. The digitized values were then passed through a moving average [10] having a window of 12 points. The average values were compared with a constant value of 160. A value of more than 160 was considered as good connectivity between the patches and the human body. On the contrary, a value of less than 160 was considered improper connectivity between the patches and the human body.

The copper-clad laminates with the transferred carbon were then kept for etching in ferric chloride (FeCl3) solution for removing the exposed copper area. Necessary holes were made at the designated places. Subsequently, the components were placed at the specified slots and then soldered. The connectivity of the tracks was tested using a multimeter.

The synthesized sinusoidal signal has been shown in Figs. S4(a) and S4(b) that are available in the Supplemental Materials on the ASME Digital Collection. A visual inspection of the signal suggested the presence of a DC offset (1.80 V, 1.77 V) in the generated signals. The peak-to-peak amplitude was found to be 2.32 Vpp and 2.28 V. The signals were then subjected to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to figure out the frequency component of the signal.

            "text": "The analysis of the synthesized signals suggested the presence of an offset voltage of 1.78 V. So, to eliminate the same, a passive high-pass filter having a cut-off frequency of 15 Hz was employed. The gain response of the filter was determined (Fig. 7(a)). It was found that the gain at 1 kHz frequency was 0 dB. This suggested that the designed filter would not affect the nature of the 1 kHz signal. However, it would be capable of eliminating the DC component from the synthesized signal. Hence, the designed filter was used to process the synthesized signals. The output of the high-pass filter has been given in Fig. 7(b). It could be seen here that the processed signal did not have any offset. Further, there was no alteration in the peak-to-peak amplitude of the processed signals as compared to the synthesized signal. The processed signals were then presented to a buffer amplifier. A buffer amplifier provides a gain of 1. Hence, there is no magnification of the signal component (Fig. 7(c)). In our study, we also found that the input signal from the high-pass filter and the output of the buffer amplifier were the same. Further, the buffer amplifier imparts an electrical impedance transformation while connecting two circuits. This helps to prevent the signal source from being affected by the load of the sink circuit. The output of the buffer amplifier was then given to the voltage-controlled constant current source that was operating in the inverting amplifier mode. The input resistance (82 k\u03a9) of the constant current source governs the current injected into the human body through the patches. This resulted in the generation of a sinusoidal current having a peak-to-peak current amplitude of 0.28 \u03bcA (Ipp). Hence, the positive and negative peak currents were 0.141 \u03bcA (Ip). The current was then injected into the iontophoresis cells, which were used as a simulated human body. Since the system was operating in the inverting amplifier mode, there was a 180 deg phase shift of the voltage signal across the iontophoresis cells (Fig. 7(d)).",

            "text": "Continuous monitoring of the impedance between the active and the passive patches was employed for the loose-lead monitoring. The passive patch was virtually grounded as it was connected with the inverting terminal of the constant current source, while the noninverting terminal was directly grounded to the ground of the electrical circuit. Hence, the current is injected into the iontophoresis cell through the active patch. Accordingly, the voltage measured at the active patch against the ground would be directly proportional to the impedance across the active and the passive patches. This means, when the patches are properly connected with the iontophoresis cell, we will get a voltage value that is proportional to the total impedance of the active patch, passive patch, and the iontophoresis cell. Since the input signal to the iontophoresis cell is sinusoidal, the output would also be sinusoidal (Fig. 8(a)). However, if either of the patches or any one of the patches gets disconnected, the circuit becomes an open circuit, and the impedance would be infinite. Here, we would get a square signal. The positive peak would go to positive saturation, while the negative peak would go to the negative saturation (Fig. 8(b)). Subsequently, the output of the iontophoresis cell is given to the buffer amplifier. The output signal was then used as the input to the inverting terminal of a voltage comparator circuit that was being operated using a \u00b15 V power supply. A constant DC voltage of 2.5 V was used for the comparison, which was connected to the noninverting terminal of the comparator. The comparator was operated using \u00b15 V power supply so as to prevent damage to the microcontroller board due to the input of the voltage that was higher than +5 V. The microcontroller board rejects the negative voltage as it functions in the range of 0 V and 5 V. The output of the comparator during the open and the close cases has been given in Figs. 8(c) and 8(d). During the open case, a square wave of 4.00 Vpp was obtained. On the contrary, during the close case, a DC voltage of 4.49 V was obtained. These signals were then acquired in the Arduino Mega ADK board. The serial monitor readings during the open case showed values lower than 160. The readings during the close case continuously showed values >200. Hence, a 12-point moving average values were used for comparison in the digital comparator. For comparison, a constant value of 160 was chosen. The comparator generated a high value when the average reading was below 160. This initiated a visual warning (activation of the virtual red LED) in the mobile app. If the average reading was above 160, there was low output, and the mobile app showed an activated virtual green LED. The serial monitor readings have been shown in Figs. 8(e) and 8(f).",

The excess copper was removed from the laminates (Fig. 9(d)), drilled, and the components were placed and consequently soldered. The components were placed as per the requirements and then soldering was performed. The developed PCB board has been shown in Fig. 9(e). Two numbers of PCBs were fabricated for implementing the dual-channel device. The connectivity of the tracks was then tested using the multimeter. Finally, the testing of the circuit was performed using a 1 kHz sinusoidal signal. The output of the signal at each step was observed in a DSO (Digital Oscilloscope) and compared with the observations made during the development stage (see Fig. S5 available in the Supplemental Materials on the ASME Digital Collection). The observations made during the developmental stage and after the PCB fabrication were found to be similar. This suggested that the designed PCBs were working fine. Then, the PCBs were integrated with the microcontroller boards. The complete system has been shown in Fig. 10.",

While doing the drug release study in the active mode, the iontophoretic device was put on using the developed mobile app. The release of the drug was monitored using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at a different time interval. The test was carried out for 2 h. The cumulative drug release (CPDR) profiles were determined (Figs. 12(a) and 12(b)) [14]. It was observed that the release of the drug was higher during iontophoresis as compared to the passive study. It is important to note that there was not much difference between the release profiles. This can be accounted for the use of the dialysis membrane, which does not exert sufficient hindrance to the drug transport as that of the skin tissue. The release profiles were modeled using the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model (Eq. (1); Figs. 12(c) and 12(d)) [15]. It was found that the diffusion of the drug was higher in both the samples when the active experiment was carried out (Table 2). Further, the diffusion exponent value \u201cn\u201d was <0.45 during the active experiment using SMP1-M. This suggested that Fickian diffusion played an essential role during the said experiment.

The skin contact impedance represents the total electrical opposition of the iontophoretic circuit to the passage of the current through it [19]. In the proposed system, this impedance was used as a measure to design a loose-lead monitoring system. In the case of detachment of the patch(es), the skin contact impedance will become infinite, and the voltage pattern across the patches (active and the passive) changes. This change in the voltage pattern was used for recognizing the loose-lead. Subsequently, this information was sent to the user via the app and stops the waveform generation for the specific channel.",

More than 30 million people are suffering from dementia worldwide [22]. It has been reported that over three out of four Alzheimer's patients need help in managing their daily medication. Again, it is not possible for the members of the patient's family to continuously monitor them. A survey conducted by the National Alliance of caregiving, 2004 showed that approximately 15% of the caregivers leave the patients alone at least for 1 h and monitor them only from a distance [23,24]. The current study uses an IoT-based drug delivery system that can be controlled using a mobile application. Prior reports inferred 81.5% of the people aged above 85, 65% of the people aged between 65 and 74 years, and 50% of people under the age of 65 experience morbidity [25], and are prescribed, a higher number of medications. The proposed system can be operated in a dual-channel mode, i.e., two different types of therapeutic agents can be delivered to the patient's body simultaneously or individually one after another according to the user's requirement. This can fulfill the need for multiple drug usage or polypharmacy.",

            "text": "In the current study, a dual-channel iontophoretic drug delivery system has been proposed. A programmable dual-channel sinusoidal signal generator was designed to provide alternating current signals for the proposed drug delivery system. The alternating current signal was meant for carrying out the iontophoresis-based drug delivery through the skin surface. An Android app was designed, and an ESP12E NodeMCU was used to enable wireless control of the drug delivery device. The drug delivery device can deliver single or multiple drugs simultaneously for the desired time duration. It is also capable of detecting the loose attachment of the drug patches with the human skin surface and generates a visual alert on detecting the loose contact. The components of the proposed device, namely, the signal generator, the iontophoretic setup, the loose-lead monitoring system, and the Android app based wireless control system, were tested for their proper functionality. Finally, an in vitro drug release study (both in active and passive modes) was performed, which suggested non-Fickian diffusion of the drug molecules and a relatively higher drug release was observed during the iontophoretic drug delivery as compared to the passive drug delivery. The current system is a prototype device for a dual-channel iontophoretic drug delivery system. However, before practical implementation, the miniaturization of the device is essential using different advanced device development techniques, such as microfabrication, nanofabrication, and MEMS-based technologies. This would allow us to develop a wearable system. We have conducted the in vitro drug release study of the proposed system. There is a need to conduct in vivo studies, including animal and human tests, to validate the functioning of the proposed device. The number of drug delivery channels can also be increased so as to avoid the complications of polypharmacy. An alarm system can also be integrated in the future that can give a gentle reminder regarding the time and dosage of medication, thereby, improving the patient-medication compliance.",
