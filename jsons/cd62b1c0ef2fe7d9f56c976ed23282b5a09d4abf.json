            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem and its prevalence and mortality are increasing throughout the world, including the Asia-Pacific region. To arrest these worldwide trends, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Expert Panel's global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of COPD was published in 2001. Based on recently published clinical trials, the GOLD statement was updated in 2003. The Asia-Pacific COPD Roundtable Group, a taskforce of expert respirologists from the Asia-Pacific region, has recently formulated a consensus statement on implementation of the GOLD strategy for COPD in the Asia-Pacific region. The key issues identified by the COPD Roundtable Group for comment are: (i) where there is no access to spirometry, diagnosis of COPD could be suspected on the basis of history, symptoms and physical signs; (ii) inhaled bronchodilators are the preferred regular treatment for COPD in the region, but oral bronchodilators may be considered if the cost of inhaled bronchodilators is a barrier to treatment; (iii) the use of an Metered Dose Inhaler with spacer in place of a nebulizer is recommended in the treatment of acute airflow obstruction in patients with COPD; (iv) influenza vaccination is recommended for all patients with COPD in communities where there is a high likelihood of Severe Acute Respitory Syndrome; and (v) simplified pulmonary rehabilitation programmes should be established in areas where comprehensive programmes are unavailable. Physical exercise training and education on smoking cessation should be core elements of any rehabilitation program. In summary, the COPD Roundtable Group supports implementation of the GOLD strategy for the diagnosis, management and prevention of COPD in the Asia-Pacific region, subject to the additions and modifications to the guidelines suggested above.",

A World Health Organization (WHO)/World Bank study estimated the worldwide prevalence of COPD in 1990 to be 9.33/1000 in men and 7.33/1000 in women. 1, 2 COPD was estimated to be the sixth most common cause of death globally, 3 and the twelfth most common cause of burden of disease worldwide. 1 Furthermore, COPD is expected to increase in prevalence and mortality over the coming decades. For example, of the four leading causes of death in the USA, COPD is the only one that continues to increase in prevalence. 4 COPD is also projected to be the fifth greatest cause of worldwide burden of disease in 2020, and the third most common cause of death internationally. 1 COPD is associated with huge economic costs. In the UK for example, COPD accounts for 10% of all working days lost, 5 and in the USA, the estimated annual cost of COPD is over US$30 billion. 6 ",

Furthermore, trends in risk factors (increased incidence of smoking, greater longevity with associated increased risk of succumbing to chronic diseases such as COPD, and increased exposure to environmental pollution) suggest that the prevalence of COPD in the Asia-Pacific region is likely to increase over coming years.",

Cosponsored by the US National Institutes of Health (Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)) and WHO, the GOLD Expert Panel consisted of health professionals from around the world with expertise in respiratory medicine, epidemiology, socioeconomics, public health, and health education. The model for this initiative was the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), an international strategy for developing comprehensive evidence-based guidelines on asthma control and management, using a committee of experts. 11 The GOLD Expert Panel agreed that the objectives of GOLD should be to increase awareness of COPD (amongst governments, public health officials, healthcare workers, and the general public), improve prevention and management of the disease, decrease COPD morbidity and mortality, and encourage new research into the disease. In 1998, the GOLD Expert Panel conducted a workshop to review existing COPD guidelines and advances in understanding of the disease, the ultimate aim being to prepare a consensus guidelines document/global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of COPD. This was published, in both full Workshop Report 12 and Executive Summary 13 forms, early in 2001. Updated GOLD guidelines, 14,15 based on clinical research published from June 2000 to March 2003 that has had an impact on the management of COPD, were published in July 2003. These reports present evidence-based guidelines on COPD diagnosis and management, and, importantly, include grades (A, B or C) for the weight of scientific evidence supporting each recommendation.",

However, the Roundtable Group also notes that, in some Asia-Pacific settings, where the cost of therapy is not reimbursed and the patient has limited financial resources, oral bronchodilator treatment may be less expensive and is, therefore, an appropriate alternative to inhaled therapy.

It is essential to ensure that inhaler technique is correct and to recheck this at each visit. 12 Patients who have been prescribed drugs using MDI and have trouble mastering inhaler technique should attempt to use a spacer with the MDI. The COPD Roundtable Group notes that use of spacers results in more efficient delivery of bronchodilator to the lungs compared to use of the MDI alone, particularly in patients who have not mastered the correct inhaler technique. Furthermore, this approach is as effective as nebulized drug delivery in patients who have been taught how to use a spacer plus a MDI correctly. 17 In these patients, alternative inhaler devices may also be tried to optimize the benefits of inhaled therapy. For example, dry powder inhalers (DPI) are breath activated and do not require the same level of hand-and-mouth coordination as MDI, so some COPD patients may find these easier to use.",

Currently, there is no gold standard for diagnosis, which usually encompasses suspicion, isolation and then empirical use of antibiotics and supportive treatment.

Since these problems particularly affect patients with stage II (moderate), stage III (severe) or stage IV (very severe) COPD, GOLD recommends that patients in these subgroups should be enrolled in pulmonary rehabilitation programmes. 12, 13 However, the GOLD guidelines also point out that category A evidence indicates that COPD patients at all stages of disease benefit (in terms of exercise tolerance and symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue) from exercise training programmes. 12, 13 As noted in the GOLD document, pulmonary rehabilitation has been carefully evaluated in a large number of clinical trials. 15 These have yielded category A evidence that pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise capacity, reduces perceived intensity of breathlessness, improves health-related quality of life, reduces the number of hospitalizations and days in hospital, and reduces anxiety and depression associated with COPD. 15 There is also category B evidence that pulmonary rehabilitation improves arm function with strength and endurance training of the upper limbs, provides benefits that extend well beyond the immediate period of training (provided home exercise training is continued after the programme ends), and improves survival in patients with COPD. 15 The GOLD guidelines also note that pulmonary rehabilitation programmes ideally involve several types of health professionals. 15 However, significant benefits can also be attained by more limited personnel, so long as the healthcare professionals concerned are aware of the needs of individual patients. The updated GOLD guidelines recommend a duration of \u2265 2 months for pulmonary rehabilitation. A comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation programme includes: 1 Exercise training : as assessed by 10 to 45-min sessions of bicycle ergometry, treadmill exercise, walking tests etc., at up to 50% peak oxygen consumption or until symptoms intervene, on a daily to weekly basis. 2 Nutrition counselling : nutritional state is an important determinant of symptoms, disability and prognosis in COPD, with both overweight and underweight patients potentially having problems. How-ever, nutritional therapy without an accompanying exercise regimen may not be helpful. 3 Education : while education of the patient is a component of most pulmonary rehabilitation programmes, its specific contribution to the improvements seen after pulmonary rehabilitation remain unclear.",

            "text": "The GOLD guidelines also emphasize that baseline and outcome assessments should be made for each participant in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme so that individual gains can be quantified and appropriate areas targeted for improvement. 15 Assessments should include history and physical examination, pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry, exercise capacity, health status and the impact of breathlessness, inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, and possibly lower limb strength in patients with muscle wasting. 15 The COPD Roundtable Group recognizes that pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the most effective management strategies for patients with COPD. Therefore, its use and benefits should be promoted to COPD patients, healthcare professionals, funding agencies, and governments in the region. Unfortunately, comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation programmes, as described in GOLD, are beyond the means of many Asian healthcare systems and, therefore, unavailable to most patients in the region. Indeed, the difficulties of providing pulmonary rehabilitation programmes in developing countries, with reduced resources available for healthcare, may be better appreciated when it is considered that in a developed country such as Canada, < 2% of the COPD population per annum has access to pulmonary rehabilitation programmes. 26 Physicians in the Asia-Pacific region who are unable to refer COPD patients to established pulmonary rehabilitation programmes are unlikely to be able to organize the complex, multidisciplinary types of programmes described in the literature. However, they may be able to organize the 'next best' alternative, that is, less complicated programmes which include only the most important components of pulmonary rehabilitation. Minimum elements of pulmonary rehabilitation which could be made available in simplified programmes involving limited numbers and types of healthcare professionals include: (i) basic exercise tests, for example, 6-min walking distance tests; (ii) regular (daily if possible) exercise, for example, walking to a symptom-limited maximum, then resting, then continuing to walk until 20 min of exercise has been completed; and (iii) educating patients about how to minimize exposure to other COPD risk factors, such as smoking, indoor air pollution due to biomass fuels and occupational hazards.",

With regard to spirometry, the Roundtable Group is keen to emphasize both the key role of this tool for diagnosing and assessing COPD, and the pressing need for greater availability of spirometers in the region. The Roundtable Group urges that the GOLD recommendations on this issue be used to mount pressure not only on regional governments and health funding agencies to finance wider access to spirometry in the region, but also on manufacturers to provide cheap but efficient spirometers. However, economic considerations are not the only barriers to use of spirometry in Asian countries; others include lack of demand for/recognition of the need for spirometric testing (by patients, healthcare professionals, and health administrators/ policymakers), lack of technical knowledge and expertise in the use of spirometers, and inappropriate emphasis on reporting, diagnosing and managing symptoms (as opposed to lung function) in patients with COPD. For these reasons, it is vital to note that the COPD Roundtable Group recommends that a diagnosis of COPD can be suspected on the basis of symptoms, physical signs and history only when spirometry is unavailable. The other important implication of this statement is that diagnosis of COPD by repeat peak expiratory flow measurements or chest X-ray appearances in these circumstances is not recommended.",

Similarly, the Roundtable Group agrees that enrolment of COPD patients in 'standard' pulmonary rehabilitation programmes is the preferred option, and one which should be promoted as much as possible, but suggests that participation in a simplified programme is better than no pulmonary rehabilitation at all.",

Health professionals caring for COPD patients should take the time to educate patients about correct inhaler technique and to check on correct technique during follow-up consultations. In some countries such as the Philippines, there is a high rate of nebulizer use, and this has prompted the COPD Roundtable Group to include a specific endorsement of the use of spacer devices before resorting to nebulization.",
