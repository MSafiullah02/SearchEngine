When diagnostic efforts and/or empiric treatment fails, thoracic surgeons have traditionally been called upon to perform surgical biopsy of the lung to aid in the diagnosis of indeterminate, life-threatening pulmonary disease. Such biopsy has been requested specifically in the case of diffuse lung disease among patients receiving treatment for solid-organ or hematologic cancers, particularly when symptoms of respiratory failure progress and when noninvasive diagnostic tests and empiric treatments fail to halt progression. In such circumstances, radiologists, pulmonologists, and thoracic surgeons may be consulted and asked to provide tissue specimens that will allow rapid, accurate diagnosis leading to specific treatment. It is imperative that biopsy take place before respiratory failure supervenes [1], and that the specimens provided to clinical laboratories, pathologists, and microbiologists are comprehensive and properly preserved.",

The cancer patient is also subject to a wide range of diffuse lung diseases unrelated to infection or malignancy [5, 6]. Lung infiltrates or nodules may represent progression or spread of the primary (or new) neoplasm to the lungs [7, 8]. There are literally thousands of drugs and drug combinations used in the treatment of cancer, and new agents and combinations are added on a frequent basis. Many of these agents have inherent lung toxicity, and most impair the immune response, fostering infection with a wide spectrum of organisms that are seldom, if ever, pathogenic in healthy individuals [9]. These considerations are further amplified in patients who undergo stem-cell transplantation. Profound and prolonged immunosuppression allows an even broader range of infectious pathogens and adds lung damage secondary to other mechanisms (e.g., diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, radiation pneumonitis, and graft-versus-host disease [GVHD] ) [10]. Adding further complexity, the entities in the expanded differential diagnosis list are addressed using a plethora of new diagnostic methods which, in their turn, have morphed over time. The risk of individual infectious organisms has also changed in response to the adoption of new prophylactic regimens [11\u201314].",

The most common of these is Aspergillus spp., primarily Aspergillus fumigatus. The spp. are followed in frequency by the Mucorales spp., Fusarium spp., and Scedosporium spp. (Fig. 10.1). Before trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMT) prophylaxis became a standard of care in HSCT, was one of the most common fungal pneumonias. Candida spp., while a common cause of mucous membrane infection and candidemia, rarely cause pulmonary infection, except for the rare pulmonary septic embolus caused by spp. Finally, the endemic fungi can cause severe pulmonary infection and disseminated disease: Coccidiodes immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Blastomyces dermatitidis.\n",

Specific potential benefits include identification of occult infection not detected by endoscopic or needle biopsy methods and diagnosis of various noninfectious lung diseases. Although it must be understood that the long-term results of treatment of such entities as BOOP, GVHD, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome are poor, biopsy results provide an accurate diagnosis to allow assessment of new treatments [55].",
