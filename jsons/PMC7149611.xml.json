A herpesvirus outbreak in 1998 and early 1999 reduced the pilchard (Sardinops sagax neophilchardus) fishery in southern Australia by two-thirds. In 2001, infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) was discovered in cultured Atlantic salmon in Cobscook Bay, Maine. The discovery of this orthomyxovirus virus forced farmers to destroy about 2.6 million fish in an effort to contain the spread of the disease. The cost to the Maine salmon industry (valued at more than $100 million) was about $24 million (USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspections Service (APHIS) estimates). More recently, the rhabdovirus viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), a very serious pathogen of marine and freshwater fish in Europe, was detected in the Great Lakes of North America in 2005. On 24 October 2006, APHIS issued an emergency order that blocked the live export of 37 fish species from any of the eight Great Lakes states. The order caused strong protests from fish farmers who make their living with live bait shipments and fish-stocking programs that sustain the Great Lakes\u2019 $4.5 billion fishing industry. Since vaccines and/or therapeutics for fish viruses are not readily available, containing the spread of these viruses by restricting movement and destruction of the affected population has been the only effective control strategy. Thus, the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) lists nine reportable diseases of fish (Table 1\n), seven of which are viral diseases.",

The first fish rhabdovirus was described in 1938 by Schaperclaus in European rainbow trout and, 6 years later, the Sacramento River Chinook virus was reported by Rucker. Since then, these viruses have been isolated, grown in tissue culture cells, and the genomes have been cloned and sequenced. The salmon virus is now called Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) which is the type species for a new genus Novirhabdovirus in the Rhabdoviridae. Other fish rhabdovirus species assigned to this genus include Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), Hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV), and Snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV). All of these viruses have negative-sense ssRNA genomes with a physical map ordered from the 3\u2032-end as follows: leader-N-P-M-G-NV-L, where N is the nucleoprotein gene, P is the phosphoprotein gene, M is the matrix protein gene, G is the glycoprotein gene, NV is the nonvirion protein gene, and L is the virion RNA polymerase gene.

This virus prefers colder temperatures with optimal growth at 8\u201315 \u00b0C. VHSV is also a serious pathogen of salmonid fish, but its host range is broader and it has been shown to kill Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), whitefish (Coregonus sp.), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). This broad host range has caused a great deal of concern to authorities in the USA since VHSV was first reported there in 2006 and found to affect freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens), round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), bluegill (Lepomis machrochirus mystacalis), crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), gizzard shard (Dorsoma cepadianum), and other species occurring in the Great Lakes. HIRRV affects hirame, the Japanese flounder (Paralychthys olivaceus), which is a highly prized food fish in Japan. Its host range includes ayu (Pleuroglossus altivelis) as well as salmonid fish. SHRV was isolated from snakehead fish (Channa striatus) suffering from epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) in Thailand. It is not considered the etiologic agent of EUS which is caused by a fungal pathogen. However, zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio), exposed to tissue culture grown SHRV develop, will develop petecchial hemorrhages and die.",

SVCV was first identified as the etiologic agent of an acute hemorrhagic disease in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Europe in 1972. The disease has since been found in Asia, the Middle East, and most recently in South and North America.

No disease syndrome was observed in trout and salmon fingerlings in subsequent infectivity trials with the tissue cultured virus. A second fish paramyxovirus that caused epidermal necrosis in juvenile black sea bream (Acanthopargrus schlegeli) was identified in Japan by electron microscopy. This virus was never cultured in vitro. The most recent description of a fish paramyxovirus was from Atlantic salmon post-smolts suffering from inflammatory gill disease in Norway. The genome of this virus has been cloned and partial sequences from the viral L protein have been used to determine the phylogenetic placement of this virus among the Paramyxoviridae.

Analysis of RNA extracted from purified blue gill virus has indicated that it is single-stranded RNA virus. Sequence characterization of the viral genomes has not been carried out and there is some suggestion that at least some of these viruses might actually be betanodaviruses.

Ultrastructural studies indicated that the cell-free virions contain of a rod-shaped nucleocapsid similar to that seen in baculoviruses. Virions are bacilliform-shaped structures somewhat reminiscent of plant rhabdoviruses with an envelope containing coronavirus-like spikes. Sequence analysis has indicated that the 26.6 kbp white bream virus (WBV) contains five open reading frames, ORF1a, -1b, -2, -3, and -4, which are produced from a \u2018nested\u2019 set of 3\u2032-coterminal mRNAs. The largest mRNA is of genome length. ORF1a and ORF1b form the viral replicase gene. ORF1a encodes several membrane domains, a putative ADP-ribose 1\u2032-phospatase, and a chymotrypsin-like serine protease. ORF1b encodes the putative polymerase, helicase, ribose methyltransferase, exoribonuclease, and endoribonuclease activities. These characteristics are consistent with classification of WBV in the order Nidovirales. Phylogenetic analyses of the helicase and polymerase core domains indicate that WBV is more closely related to toroviruses than to coronaviruses and it has been suggested that a new nidovirus genus Bafinivirus be established (from bacilliform fish nidoviruses).",

These tumors are formed on the surface of adult walleye (Stizeostedion vitreum) in the fall and regress in the spring. The genome of the virus (13.2 kbp) was larger than all other known retroviruses at the time. Sequence analysis indicated that WDSV contained three additional open reading frames: ORF C at the 5\u2032 terminal end; and ORF A and ORF B at the 3\u2032 terminal end. ORF A encodes a D-cyclin homolog (retroviral cyclin) that locates in the nucleus of tumor cells in interchromatic granule clusters. ORF C encodes a cytoplasmic protein that targets the mitochondria and is associated with apoptosis. It is expressed in regressing tumors when full-length viral RNA is synthesized. The function of the protein encoded in ORF B, which is distantly related to ORF A, remains unknown. The WDSV protease cleavage sites have been identified to contain glutamine in the P2 position. The WDSV reverse transcriptase is rapidly inactivated at temperatures greater than 15 \u00b0C; a finding that is consistent with adaptation to growth in a coldwater fish species.",
