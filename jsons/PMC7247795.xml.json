AP-HP also hosts 40% of the French biomedical research. As a result of its size and location, AP-HP has been a major player in France's COVID-19 response, as it was in responding to terrorist attacks.1 AP-HP has a reputation of being an institution with a size, cumbersome operations, and internal competition that prevent any nimble response. We are a group of health-care professionals at AP-HP who are directly involved in the management of the COVID-19 response by AP-HP. Having faced the COVID-19 pandemic, and remaining humble in facing the future, we describe how size and coordinated management might actually have helped the organisation, speed, and consistency of the response to the COVID-19 crisis.",

However, the situation became worse than expected (appendix). At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2677 patients with COVID-19 were admitted into ICUs in the region, 41% of whom were admitted to AP-HP. A few points deserve discussion.",

This fast initiation of research was possible because of a shared research support infrastructure and reallocation of all research personnel, supplemented by volunteers. The centralised pharmaceutical office made drugs and placebos available at each hospital.
