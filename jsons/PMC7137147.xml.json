However, early estimates of this epidemiological construct are sometimes given unwarranted emphasis in assessment of pandemic potential, as discussed by Romulus Breban and colleagues in The Lancet.2 A more nuanced understanding of pathogen emergence and R0 is needed to formulate appropriate disease-control policies. R0, similar to most statistical constructs, represents a distribution, and might have region-specific or population-specific heterogeneities resulting from biological and contextual factors. Initial epidemiological assessments are often based on non-representative cases and can be biased. We discuss specific examples relevant to emerging influenza strains and coronaviruses, but the notions are generalisable to the emergence of any pathogen.",

However, the R0 of a particular pathogen is not one number, but is the mean of population distributions of infectivities and contact patterns. For example, Mary Mallon (known as Typhoid Mary) was a cook whose role in food preparation made her personal R0 (the number of secondary cases of infection deriving from direct or indirect contact with typhoid bacilli she shed) probably far higher than the population average; she is thought to have infected 54 others with Salmonella typhi.3 The detection of Mary Mallon as a shedder of S typhi might be related partly to the fact that she had such a high personal R0. Such interindividual variability has been referred to as superspreading,4 and has been documented for several pathogens.5\n",

We do not disagree with this conclusion, but would argue that such an analysis is overly simplistic for several reasons. For example, in a similar analysis8 we came to similar conclusions with regard to the mean R0 of MERS-CoV, but noted that a 22 case cluster (the size of the largest cluster reported at that time) would be unlikely\u2014a probability of about 0\u00b708%, similar to that of getting 10\u201311 heads in a row if tossing a fair coin\u2014with an R0 of 0\u00b776 (figure\n).",

This difference might have resulted from differential crowding and a younger age distribution (those born before 1957 seem to have been protected against infection) in isolated First Nations reservations.11 If the mean value of R0 is fixed, heterogeneity caused by differences between individuals in one setting (eg, superspreaders5) or by differences between settings (hospital vs community) both increase variation in cluster size and reduce the probability that any particular individual infection will cause an epidemic.4\n",
