To tackle more realistic sources of continuous release, this paper advances the method to identify continuously releasing single contaminant source. The study formulates a suite of inverse modeling algorithms that can promptly locate dynamic source with known release time for IAQ events. Two field experiments are employed to verify the prediction: one in a multi-room apartment and the other in a hospital ward which was involved in a SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003. The developed algorithms promptly and accurately identify the source locations in both cases.",

In practice, contaminant source control, ventilation, and air purification are typically used to achieve a good indoor air quality. Supplying fresh air and cleaning dirty air are effective IAQ management methods if the contaminant source(s) or contaminated zone(s) can be determined. Without contaminant source conditions (location, release time and strength), current building mechanical systems could even facilitate contaminant propagation, serving as a natural pollutant carrier; and air cleaning devices (e.g., filter and ultraviolet system) might suffer from inefficiency if not placed at proper contaminant transport paths. Disclosing contaminant source conditions is thus critical to IAQ control.",

The developed method has undergone a number of numerical experiments, verifying the effectiveness of the algorithm. However, the method still needs validation using realistic field experiments that may incorporate many operational uncertainties. In addition, most IAQ incidents may experience a continuous contaminant release with either constant or dynamic release intensity. Such examples may include chemicals being released from building materials, furnishings, and household products like air fresheners; particulate matter (PM) from instance smoking and furnace combustion; and virus from continuous (or intermittent) coughing and sneezing. Compared to instantaneous sources, these continuously or intermittently releasing sources are referred as dynamic sources. Developing proper algorithms for tracking dynamic sources and verifying the inverse tracking methods using physical experiments are the two main focuses of this paper.",

The source location with the maximum probability among the N potential sources is the most possible source location. This conventional method would thus require N forward pollutant transport experiments to locate the source.

All windows were closed during the experiment except the ones in balcony 1 (W1) and bedroom 2 (W4). A floor fan of 52 watts was placed very close to the window in bedroom 2, and operating at its full speed to induce airflow into the apartment through the window W4. The airflow was supposed to exit the apartment through the window W1. An airflow velocity measurement on the floor fan determined the total volume flow rate of the fan was about 1250 m 3 /h. The apartment was vacant during the test and there was no other heat source or sink inside the space. In addition, the monitored indoor and outdoor temperatures were almost identical during the testing season. Hence, temperature influence was not considered for the airflow and contaminant transport. During the experiment, a CO 2 source placed at the center of bedroom 2 (height of the source = 0.8 m) was releasing CO 2 at a constant rate of 5 L/min from 16:35 on the test day. Two CO 2 sensors were placed at the center of the bedroom 1 and the living room, respectively, at the height of 0.4 m and 0.3 m, which recorded the CO 2 concentration every one minute. One was a PPMonitor Stand Alone System (SAS), and the other one was a HWF-1 infrared CO 2 monitor. Both were calibrated before the test. The accuracy of the sensors provided in the manual is \u00b140 ppm + 3% of reading. The measured CO 2 concentration in ambient environment was 404 ppm.

The simulated airflow field was calibrated using the measured CO 2 concentration profiles, by adjusting the main assumed input parameters to the multi-zone model (i.e., the leakage area of each window to the outside for this case).

A CFD model of the apartment was built as illustrated in Fig. 9 , in which two open windows were represented by two equally sized openings while other closed windows were assumed to have small leakages. The window in front of which the floor fan stands was assumed to have a constant incoming airflow. All objects in the model had the same temperature, indicating no presence of buoyancy effect. Figure 9 shows the predicted airflow field by CFD. To ensure a proper representation of the indoor airflow characteristics during the test, a similar airflow calibration process using CO 2 concentration was carried out, which adjusted the primary unknown input of CFD-the leakage area of each closed window. Because the experiment used a mechanical fan at the front of a window to simulate constant and strong natural ventilation, this air driving force is much more dominant to the indoor environment than the influence of the infiltration. As a result, a less accurate leakage model will have less impact on the source prediction. For a space that is dominated by infiltration, a much serious calibration or validation on infiltration or indoor airflow will be needed. With two rounds of adjustment and calibration, the concentrations from the CFD model reach an acceptable agreement with those from the experiment, as revealed by Fig. 10 . Note that a precisely accurate airflow field is not necessary for the inverse tracking method to correctly locate the contaminant source. As a result, a coarse CFD grid (about 260 000) with a typical turbulence model for indoor environment modeling (e.g., KERNG model used in this study) is adequate for this contaminant source identification task. The coarse grid CFD reached 0.1% convergence within 1200 iterations (due to the iso-thermal nature of the case).",

After sufficient long time release of aerosols, the particle concentration was measured at all the beds as indicated in Fig. 13 . During the experiment, the supply and exhaust airflow rates in the ward were also measured. The mean supply air temperature was measured to be 14.3\u2103. A total heat gain of 11.64 kW was identified in the ward, including 2.232 kW from lighting, 2.964 kW from 39 patients (76 W each), and 6.444 kW from others.",

To calibrate the airflow model, a forward contaminant transport simulation was performed with the CFD model. The predicted concentration distribution pattern was then compared with the experiment results, which shows a reasonable agreement. CO 2 was used as an indicator for the fine aerosols and this method was shown to be feasible in Li et al. (2004) . As a result, no adjustment was made in the CFD model. Fig. 12 Floor plan and predicted airflow pattern of the ward (from Li et al. 2004) With the predicted airflow in the ward, an inverse modeling was conducted with the real concentration readings from the sensors at beds 1, 9, and 13 (shown in Fig. 13 ). Figure 14 illustrates the predicted source location, which is very close to where the aerosol source was. The relatively accurate prediction of the source patient location shows that the developed inverse method is capable of predicting the location of the source patient in an airborne infection outbreak.

With the new concept of dynamic standard adjoint location probability (SALP-D), the previously developed adjoint probability method can be used to identify single dynamic pollutant source with known releasing time and strength profile. Two physical experiments using constant CO 2 sources have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the improved algorithm, with one in a multi-room apartment and the other in a hospital ward. Both multi-zone and CFD based inverse modeling have been performed in the apartment case to locate the room with source as well as the exact location of CO 2 source in the room, while CFD based inverse modeling was used for the hospital ward due to the open floor feature of the large space. During the simulation, approximate airflow fields in both cases were acquired through a concentration-based calibration process. The calibrated close-to-reality airflow field was then used with the actual sensor outputs to predict the source location in the spaces. The study results verify that the inverse modeling algorithm developed can successfully track the source location with good accuracy and speed. Although both test cases had a constant source releasing rate, the method developed works for any dynamic source with varying releasing rates, should the source releasing profile is provided. The current inverse tracking algorithm can only handle a single contaminant source with known release time under steady state indoor airflow conditions. The advance of the method for detecting more complex contamination conditions (e.g., multiple-sources, unknown release time, and unsteady flow) will be reported in the near future.",
