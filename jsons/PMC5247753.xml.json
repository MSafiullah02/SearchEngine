In vitro, DCs can be differentiated from blood monocytes by incubation with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 6 days44. Both monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs express TLR4 and stimulation of TLR4 by LPS induces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, although the nature of the cytokine response varies according to the cell type (Fig. 2). TLR4 stimulation of DCs induces their phenotypic and functional maturation19. The inhibitory action of FP7 was thus tested on these primary cells. Cells were pre-treated with FP7 15 minutes prior to LPS stimulation for 24 h. FP7 almost completely blocked induction of IL-8, IL-6, and MIP-1\u03b2, 3 of the major cytokines secreted by monocytes stimulated with LPS (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S1a). DCs stimulated by LPS showed a classic phenotype of human mature DC (mDC) with a strong induction of CD86 and CD40 expression and increased expression of HLA-DR, CD80, CD83 and CD54 (Fig. 2b). LPS-stimulated DCs secrete high levels of IL-8, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, as well as IL-12 and IL-10 that are important indicators of their function (Supplementary Fig. S1b). FP7 abrogated the enhanced expression of all these phenotypic markers triggered by LPS. After DC differentiation, FP7 treatment also prevented LPS-induced secretion of IL-8, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 p40, and IL-10 up to 100 ng/ml of LPS and inhibited cytokine secretion induced by 1000 ng/ml (Fig. 2c,d). Thus, FP7 prevents LPS-induced maturation of DCs.",

To evaluate the IC50 of FP7 on primary cells, monocytes and DCs were pre-treated with increasing doses of FP7 for 15 minutes before stimulation with 10 ng/ml of LPS. IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1\u03b2 secretion was then assayed in supernatants collected 24 h post-stimulation. The results indicate that FP7 inhibits the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines both in monocytes and DCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). For monocytes, FP7 IC50 was 0.06 \u03bcM for IL-6, 0.13 \u03bcM for IL-8, and 0.07 \u03bcM for MIP-1\u03b2 secretion. For DCs, FP7 IC50 was 0.22 \u03bcM for IL-6, 0.44 \u03bcM for IL-8, and 0.32 \u03bcM for MIP-1\u03b2 secretion. These results correlate with the previous data obtained with HEK-Blue\u2122-hTLR4 cells40. Monocyte and DC viability measurements showed that FP7 was not toxic at the maximal concentration of 10 \u03bcM (Supplementary Fig. S2). This concentration of FP7 was thus used in further experiments.",

TLR2 forms a heterodimer with TLR1 to bind triacylated lipopeptides45 and with TLR6 to recognize diacylated lipopeptides46. HEK293 cells co-expressing human TLR4 with MD2 and CD14 (HEK293/hTLR4-MD2-CD14), or TLR1 and TLR2 (HEK293/hTLR1-TLR2), or TLR2 and TLR6 (HEK293/hTLR2-TLR6) were used to verify that ultrapure LPS could activate TLR4 only and not TLR1/2- or TLR2/6-expressing cells (Fig. 4a\u2013c). Endotoxin-free TLR1/2 ligand Pam3CSK4 (Pam3), TLR2/6 ligand peptidoglycan (PGN), and TLR3 ligand double-stranded RNA poly(I:C) (pIC) failed to stimulate TLR4-expressing cells (data not shown). The effect of DC pre-treatment with 10 \u03bcM FP7 prior to activation by LPS, Pam3, PGN, and pIC was analysed. Secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1\u03b2 was measured in the supernatants at 24 h post-stimulation.

We investigated whether this metabolic regulation could be observed in monocyte-derived human DCs. Differentiated DCs were seeded in fresh medium prior to LPS stimulation for 24 h. Glucose consumption and lactate production were monitored to assess the input and output rates of glycolysis. We found that LPS stimulation increased both the glucose consumption and the lactate production by DCs, indicative of an enhanced glycolytic flux (Fig. 5a,b). Treatment of cells with FP7 prior to LPS stimulation inhibited these metabolic changes induced by LPS up to 100 ng/ml. At the highest LPS concentration, FP7 could not completely block the increase of the glycolytic flux, consistent with cytokine secretion data (Fig. 2). TLR4-specific blocking antibody also prevented the increase of glucose consumption induced by LPS (Fig. 5c). These results indicate that TLR4 stimulation induced an increased glycolytic flux in monocyte-derived human DCs that can be inhibited by FP7.",

Treatment of DC with a non-toxic low dose of 2-DG strongly inhibited LPS-induced glucose consumption and lactate production (Fig. 6a,b), as expected. By preventing the glycolytic burst induced by LPS, 2-DG also altered DC maturation as indicated by the reduced expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86 (Fig. 6c) and by the reduced secretion of cytokines triggered by LPS (Fig. 6d,e). Therefore, metabolic reprogramming of DC upon TLR4 stimulation is required for a complete maturation process of DCs. In monocytes, glucose consumption was slightly increased upon LPS stimulation and this could be inhibited by the TLR4 antagonist FP7 (Supplementary Fig. S3). This modest regulation by TLR4 seemed to be correlated with the high level of glucose consumption of these cells without stimulation.",

Interestingly, the TLR4 antagonist Eritoran protected mice from lethal influenza infection and blunted ALI3839. We therefore tested the activity of FP7 during a lethal influenza challenge. WT mice were infected with mouse-adapted influenza strain PR8 and treated with vehicle (saline; NT), or FP7 for 5 consecutive days starting on day 2 post-influenza challenge (days 2\u20136). Treatment of PR8-infected mice with FP7 resulted in significant protection (P < 0.01; Fig. 7a). Haematoxylin and eosin-stained lung tissue sections were analysed and scored blindly for peribronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonia, perivasculitis, and alveolitis. FP7 treatment prevented lung pathology induced by influenza infection (Fig. 7b,c).",

Total RNA was extracted from lung homogenates and gene expression measured by qRT-PCR. FP7 led to a significant reduction in influenza-induced gene expression for TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b2, KC (P < 0.01; Fig. 8a\u2013c), IL-6, and RANTES (P < 0.05; Fig. 8d).

We have shown that FP7 inhibits TLR4 signalling in a concentration-dependent manner in both monocytes and DCs, preventing the induction of cytokine secretion in both cell types and the phenotypic maturation of DCs. The IC50 of cytokine production inhibition by FP7 was estimated below 1 \u03bcM in both monocytes and DCs. No significant inhibition of TLR1/2 or TLR2/6 activation by their selective ligands was detected, indicating that FP7 is a selective antagonist of TLR4 even at the highest dose of 10 \u03bcM. FP7 is a lipid A analogue, shown in previous studies to bind to MD-2 and CD14 and inhibit LPS-induced TLR4 signalling40. Although its structure might be expected to interact with TLR2/6, that detects diacylated disaccharides, it is clear from our data that the inhibition is TLR4-specific, suggesting a more precise molecular interaction with MD-2.",

These innate immune cells reside in different tissues and fulfill various functions. Monocytes recruited into inflamed tissues can differentiate to DCs or M\u03a6s depending on the local micro-environment. DCs can be stimulated to mature DCs by exogenous pathogen-derived molecules or endogenous danger signals released by cells that are stressed, infected, or necrotic474849. During the maturation process, DCs acquire enhanced abilities to present antigens resulting from enhanced capturing activity, increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, and induced expression of genes encoding co-stimulation molecules and cytokines. Mature DCs can migrate to lymph nodes where they present antigens and prime na\u00efve T cells43, whereas M\u03a6s are resident cells that have high phagocytic capacities, secrete cytokines, and present antigens to tissue-infiltrating T cells. Our results indicate that FP7 inhibits TLR4-mediated monocyte and DC activation and this could prevent excessive TLR4 signalling involved in inflammatory pathologies.",

            "text": "The importance of metabolic regulation in the control of DCs and M\u03a6s functions has recently emerged from several studies50. We found in this study that TLR4 stimulation of human monocyte-derived DCs increased both glucose consumption and lactate production that are indicators of an increased glycolytic activity. Preventing the glycolytic burst using an hexokinase inhibitor strongly reduced the TLR4-dependent induction of the costimulatory molecule CD86 and the secretion of cytokines, indicating that upregulation of glycolysis is required for proper DC maturation. These results are in agreement with previous studies showing that TLR4 signalling induced in murine bone marrow-derived DCs a transition of cellular metabolism to aerobic glycolysis, similar to the Warburg effect described in cancer cells272829. A similar metabolic switch was also described for murine M\u03a6s stimulated by LPS and resulting in a proinflammatory \u201cM1\u201d phenotype, again consistent with the effect of 2DG on M\u03a6 cytokine secretion induced by LPS51525354. More generally, glycolysis is important to support DC activation through various PRR to initiate the synthesis of molecules that are critical for cellular functions. In culture, less than 10% of DC can be infected by influenza virus so that glucose consumption and lactate production does not vary at the population level (data not shown). However, DC can still detect the virus through various PRR and react by secreting cytokines. Glycolysis inhibition of DCs by 2-DG reduced cytokine secretion triggered by influenza virus detection (Supplementary Table 1). Glycolysis was also found to be essential for anti-viral response triggered by human plasmacytoid DCs55. These observations raised the question of whether pathogens that interfere with TLR4 activation could perturb the regulation of glucose metabolism of innate immune cells. Although there is accumulating evidence indicating that cell metabolic profile is crucial for immune cell function, the molecular mechanisms involved in this functional fine-tuning have not been described so far for human monocyte-derived DCs. In murine DCs derived in vitro from bone marrow, two different molecular pathways have been depicted for glycolytic reprogramming. TLR4 signalling involving the activation of TBK1-IKK\u03b5 and AKT kinases was found to control the early increase in glycolysis27. The late increase in glycolytic metabolism upon TLR4 stimulation was found to be a survival response of murine inflammatory DCs to maintain their ATP production despite the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by NO. production28. Although we cannot exclude a contribution of NO. in the metabolic regulation of DCs by TLR4, we were unable to measure significant NO. production by monocyte-derived DCs (data not shown) and this is in agreement with previous results obtained for human M\u03a6s56.",

In vitro, HMGB1 can stimulate monocyte-derived DCs, inducing proinflammatory cytokine secretion and FP7 prevented DC activation by HMGB1 (Supplementary Fig. S4). In vivo, FP7 not only strongly reduced influenza infection-induced lethality, but also significantly improved the histopathology scores of infected lungs. FP7 prevented excessive inflammation and lung tissue damage and improved the survival rate in this model. FP7 administration also strongly reduced cytokine mRNA and protein production and HMGB1 levels (Table 1) induced by influenza infection. In this model, influenza infection induces a cytokine storm and the accumulation of oxidized products of phospholipids in infected lungs or circulating HMGB1, both of which are inhibited by Eritoran therapy3839. Given the inhibitory effect of FP7 on the level of cytokines and HMGB1 induced by PR8 infection, it can be reasonably assumed that the benefit of FP7 treatment of influenza virus\u2013infected mice is linked to its ability to inhibit TLR4 signalling by DAMPs like HMGB1 and the subsequent TLR4-dependent cytokine storm.",

            "text": "The mechanism of action of FP7 has been studied by dissecting its physical interactions with CD14 and TLR4.MD-240. FP7 was designed as a mimetic of lipid X, a biosynthetic precursor of lipid A, and docks well into MD-2 binding cavity40. This molecule revealed an unexpectedly high affinity for CD14 and it induces in bone marrow-derived M\u03a6s selective endocytosis of CD14, but not of the TLR4.MD-2 complex40. That could impact TLR4 signalling in monocytes and M\u03a6s which express membrane-bound CD14. It was previously shown in murine cells that CD14 promoted LPS-induced TLR4 endocytosis, favouring TRIF-dependent signalling that required internalization of TLR45. These conditions are expected to antagonize TLR4 signalling more effectively than simply competing with LPS for CD14, and TLR4.MD2 binding. Monocyte-derived human DCs do not express membrane-bound CD14 and although soluble CD14 present in the serum can serve as a co-factor for LPS binding on TLR4, enhancing both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signalling57, this soluble receptor cannot trigger internalization. This difference with monocytes may explain why the IC50 of FP7 is slightly higher for DCs than for monocytes. Synthesis of FP7 which is a diacylated monosaccharide requires a short procedure giving high yield that is suitable for scale-up. The good bioavailability, high water solubility, lack of toxicity, and selective TLR4 activity make FP7 an ideal compound to be developed as a new drug that targets TLR4-related microbial and sterile inflammatory diseases.",
