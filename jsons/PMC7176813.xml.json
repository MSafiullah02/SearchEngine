ARDS diagnosis is delayed or missed entirely in a substantial proportion of patients. In the LUNG SAFE study, the largest existing international cohort of patients with ARDS, investigators were able to determine if ARDS was present, and at what stage the clinician made the diagnosis of ARDS [1]. The diagnosis of ARDS was delayed or missed in two-thirds of patients, with the diagnosis missed entirely in 40% of patients, while ARDS recognition ranged from 51% in mild ARDS to 79% in severe cases [1].",

Failure of clinicians to recognize ARDS is a barrier to the use of protective lung ventilation strategies [2, 3]. The importance of early recognition and management is underscored by the finding that patients receiving higher tidal volumes shortly after the onset of ARDS onset have a higher mortality, suggesting that high tidal volume is more injurious if used earlier [4]. While in the LUNG SAFE study, patients that clinicians recognized as ARDS received only marginally lower tidal volumes, this may be more a reflection of the penetration of lower tidal volume ventilation into clinical practice. Clinician recognition of ARDS was associated with the use of higher PEEP levels and with greater use of prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, suggesting that failure to recognize ARDS in a timely fashion leads to failure to use strategies that improve survival in ARDS. Furthermore, failure of clinicians to recognise ARDS may impair broader (research funders, policy makers, general public) awareness of the impact of ARDS.",

            "text": "In the absence of a diagnostic test, patients must fulfil a set of clinical criteria within a specific time frame that have relatively high sensitivity but low specificity for ARDS (Table 1) [5]. The inter-observer reliability of the Berlin ARDS definition is moderate, mainly due to variability in chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation [6]. The oxygenation criterion, namely the ratio of arterial PO2 to inspired oxygen fraction, is not measured at standardized ventilator settings, and can vary substantially in a single patient as different FiO2 [7]. In fact, it is often not calculated at the bedside, possibly because clinicians may incorrectly assume that these patients cannot have ARDS if they receive a \u201csafe\u201d FiO2. The anteroposterior CXR criterion is central to the diagnosis of ARDS\u2014yet this is a poorly reliable test with high inter-observer variability in interpretation [8] while training programs in CXR interpretation have limited efficacy [9]. Other aspects of the definition, such as the timing criterion are relatively arbitrary. These concerns may erode clinician confidence in the utility of making the diagnosis of ARDS. The Berlin definition of ARDS presents an ambiguity in how the patients non-invasively ventilated with CPAP, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio lower that 200 mmHg should be classified as these do not, technically, fit in any of the categories [5]. The inability to proper apply the Berlin definition in these patients may contribute to ARDS under-diagnosis.",

The presence of chronic underlying lung disorders may affect the ARDS radiologic or oxygenation criteria. It should not be that surprising that clinicians fail\u2014sometimes frequently\u2014to recognize these clinical patterns in a timely fashion. ICU clinicians are exposed to information overload from many sources, including clinical reports, flowcharts, bedside monitors, and laboratory results [10]. The ability of even experienced clinicians to consistently integrate multiple clinical variables is limited to perhaps 3\u20135 information chunks [11]. In LUNG SAFE, higher nurse (or physician)-to-patient ratio increased the likelihood of recognition, suggesting that clinician workload and its related information overload may promote under-recognition. Indeed, the more \u2018stereotypical\u2019 the presentation, i.e. the younger the patient, the greater the severity of hypoxemia, and the presence of pneumonia the greater the clinician recognition.",

Biomarker panels may help, but given the high sensitivity of the consensus criteria, additional markers may be superfluous for detection\u2014but be of great use in confirmation (i.e. to reduce \u2018false positives\u2019) or to identify biologically homogenous subgroups within the ARDS population.
