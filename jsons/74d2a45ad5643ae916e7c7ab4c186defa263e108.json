Unfortunately, aviation has also been used as a weapon of mass destruction, particularly in the context of the catastrophic events of 11 September 2001. The latest concern of the international community may well be that, although aviation cannot be matched by other means of transportation in view of the speed inherent in air transport, it nonetheless portends certain threats to human health which may emerge as a result of its very nature, requiring the cloistering of a large number of humans in a limited space where ventilation and air pressure have to be provided in a contrived manner.",

Although the spread of the disease abated to a manageable degree in a few months of its outbreak, the threat of a pandemic lingered on and it would not be surprising if it were to resurface after a lapse of time. A vaccine against this dreaded disease may be several years away and the prospects of a cure are not in sight. Some experts on communicable diseases have gone to the extent of predicting a global pandemic, along the lines of the Influenza which afflicted the world in 1919-20 killing 20 million worldwide despite its low morbidity rate of 1 %. The threat posed by SARS is compounded by the fact that already large countries such as China are severely affected, along with countries that have a high rate of trans-border communication such as Hong Kong and Singapore. It could be envisioned that, unless contained, the disease could spread to other large countries such as Australia, Canada (which has already shown susceptibility) and the United States, along with the States of Europe. Stringent measures have already been taken by the countries afflicted such as enforcement of quarantines on thousands of hospital employees and patients, together with isolation of those not ill but have had some contact with afflicted individuals. 2 Air carrier liability in negligence is extensively discussed in Abeyratne (2002b) ",

To have full realization, the nature of the disease and the manner in which it spreads has to be fully understood. In general, SARS begins with a fever greater than 100.4 F (>38.0 C). Other symptoms may include headache, an overall feeling of discomfort, and body aches. Some people also experience mild respiratory symptoms. After 2-7 days, SARS patients may develop a dry cough and have trouble breathing.",

Most cases of SARS have involved people who cared for or lived with someone with SARS, or had direct contact with infectious material (for example, respiratory secretions) from a person who has SARS. Potential ways in which SARS can be spread include touching the skin of other people or objects that are contaminated with infectious droplets and then touching your eye(s), nose, or mouth. This can happen when someone who is sick with SARS coughs or sneezes droplets onto themselves, other people, or nearby surfaces. It also is possible that SARS can be spread more broadly through the air or by other ways that are currently not known. Thus, the aircraft cabin environment is highly conducive to the spread of the SARS virus.",

Any airborne disease such as SARS is impacted by the environment, particularly if such were to be an enclosed one as in an aircraft cabin. The ventilation system plays a critical part in this regard and therefore, it is crucial to an air carrier's conduct to determine the manner in which an air carrier decides on ventilation systems in its aircraft. For instance, early jet aircraft until the last decade offered 100 % fresh air in the cabin. However, in the 1990s, ironically with more evolved technology, ventilation systems in aircraft were built in such a way as to recycle stale air, thus increasing the chances of survival of bacteria in the aircraft cabin. Even if such a practice were ineluctable, in that recycling is a universal practice which is calculated to conserve fuel, a prudent airline would take other measures, such as change of air filters through which ventilation is provided.",

The humidity level in the air of an aircraft cabin at cruising level has been recognized as being of 10-20 % humidity which is approximately the same as desert air. The lack of humidity per se does not facilitate the transmission of airborne vectors, but makes breathing difficult, particularly for persons suffering from respiratory diseases, such as Asthma. When dry air becomes stale through recycling, the chances of removing droplets of air which is usually accomplished by fresh air becomes remote. A suggested solution for a prudent airline to take in this regard is to reintroduce 100 % fresh air which is humidified.",

This requires international collaboration in the detection, reduction or elimination of the sources from which infection spreads rather than attempts to prevent the introduction of disease by legalistic barriers that over the years have proved to be ineffective. 4 Of course, the purpose of this philosophy will be defeated if individual States have no willingness or the political will to notify the outbreak of communicable diseases to WHO, particularly in the absence of a monitoring body, incentives for States to notify or sanctions. Therefore the preeminent obligation of States is to ensure that the outbreak of any communicable disease is notified in a manner that would benefit the world and help prevent the spread of the disease across national boundaries. Regrettably, there have been instances recorded where WHO reports that no new instances of a communicable disease has been recorded while the news media give contrary information simultaneously. 5 One of the reasons adduced for the lack of interest on the part of States to report the incidence of communicable diseases to a world body such as WHO has been identified as the lack of importance attributed to International Health Regulations (IHR) by States who consider the regulations as an obsolete relic. 6 The international health dimension of SARS involves human rights issues as well. International human rights law has laid down two critical aspects relating to public health: that protection of public health constitutes legitimate grounds for limiting human rights in certain circumstances (such as detention of persons or house arrest tantamount to quarantine exercises would be justified in order to contain a disease); and individuals have an inherent right to health. In this context it is not only the State or nation that has an obligation to notify WHO of communicable disease but the human concerned as well, who has an abiding moral and legal obligation. In 1975, WHO issued a policy statement which subsumed its philosophy on health and human rights which stating: 3 See Gear and Deutschman (1981) The individual is obliged to notify the health authorities when he is suffering from a communicable disease (including venereal diseases) or has been exposed to infection, and must undergo examination, treatment, surveillance, isolation or hospitalization. In particular, obligatory isolation or hospitalization in such cases constitutes a limitation on freedom of movement and the right to liberty and security of person. 7 It is critical for an evaluation of the health and aeronautical implications of SARS that the term \"health\" be defined in context. While the WHO Constitution identifies as an objective of the Organization \"attainment of the highest possible level of health\", the state of health is defined as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\". 8 In an aeronautical perspective, as will be seen later in this chapter, this is a tough act to follow, as international responsibility in the carriage of persons extends only as far as the obligation to prevent injury, wounding or death, and not to the physical or mental well-being of a person.",

Canada declared a health emergency and Taiwan advised against travel to the mainland. 11 It was reported that Airbus Industries had revealed in early May 2003 that several airlines hit by the SARS crisis requested formal postponement of aircraft deliveries. 12 According to this report the SARS crisis was persistent and affected traffic figures adversely, compounding problems already caused by the war in Iraq. The enormity of the problem is brought to bear by the response of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which issued guidelines on 2 The International Air Transport Association (IATA) as part of its response to the crisis, set up a SARS operations Centre in Singapore, one of the worst hit States, in order to help coordinate efforts in the region in containing the disease. 14 IATA's aim was to assist in the establishment of effective and efficient screening processes that could be the result of combined public health expertise offered by Governments along with operational expertise of airports and airlines. 15 Furthermore, IATA and WHO met in Bangkok in April 2003 to coordinate and refine plans to curb the possibility of the disease affecting air transport, where IATA identified the disease as a global problem, requiring a global solution, needing the coordinated support and understanding of governments. . .which meant that the imposition of reactionary and inefficient countermeasures must be avoided 16 IATA's official view pertaining to the effects of SARS on the air transport industry was that the virus posed the biggest threat the airlines have ever faced and that SARS related airline losses would overtake the $10 billion loss suffered as a result of the Iraq war. 17 According to IATA, passenger loads on all airlines plunged as a result directly or indirectly of SARS and Hong Kong carriers such as Cathay Pacific and Dragonair had suffered losses as much as 70 %. 18 On the insurance front, the London underwriters were reported to have withdrawn aviation insurance coverage for travel to countries affected by SARS. 19 The Air Transport Association of the United States announced that the world situation continues to play havoc with the airline market place. . .and that for the week ending 6 April, systemwide traffic for the biggest US carriers had dropped by 17. Elsewhere, there were at least two airlines which reduced scheduled flights or operations as a result of the crisis: KLM announced its reduction of flights to Asia and its intent to fly smaller aircraft with lesser capacity to Asian destinations, thus reducing its total capacity by 3 % 21 ; and QANTAS delayed its aircraft orders and downsized its staff by 400. 22 Cathay Pacific announced the most comprehensive and aggressive cabin health programme ever launched by a commercial carrier in order to ensure the health of passengers and reassure air crews of cabin safety despite the SARS threat. 23",

Although the World Health Organization (WHO) categorized the outbreak of the H5N1 avian flu virus as being in Phase 3 24 (which is by no means in the pandemic stage) the outbreak caused widespread fears of a human flu pandemic. Air carriers, particularly in Asia where the virus broke out in birds, have taken several measures, looking at specific countries where they consider health risks are high, and placing an embargo on the transport of live birds. 25 However, the above notwithstanding, Asian countries are not panicking. 26 Some have even cautioned that, in reality, the threat of an avian flu pandemic is no more real today than it was when the virus first broke out 8 years ago and that there is no cause to believe that a pandemic is upon the world. 27 At the time of writing, neither the WHO nor the United States Disease Control Centres had issued travel advisories urging the public to avoid travelling to infected areas, despite a request by President Bush of the US Congress for a $7.1 billion fund injection for an avian flu preparedness plan. 28 Unfortunately for the air transport industry, although precipitate political action in a Phase 3 situation will be addressed by the international Organizations and governmental authorities with cautious restraint, the public at large will panic if the situation worsens, causing the sale of air transport to plummet worldwide. According to WHO, Phase 3 represents human infections of a new sub type, but no human to human spread or at more rare instances of spread to a close contact. In Phase 3, the virus subsides in initially affected countries but not in other countries to which it has spread. See Article 14. Prevention of Spread of Disease example of Thailand when the outbreak of avian flu was in its incipient stage is a good one. When Thailand, which is the fourth largest exporter of poultry in the world, announced on 17 January 2004 the presence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in both humans and poultry, the population of the country became bewildered and dismayed, which brought immediate and drastic consequences on the economy and tourism. The announcement percolated overseas, having dramatic results on the international community. 29 A rapidly spreading pandemic would be as disastrous to the industry as the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, where States rallied together under the auspices of ICAO as well as by themselves to keep the air transport industry afloat. 30 As during the SARS outbreak, aviation insurance underwriters may review the situation in terms of aircraft fleet coverage 31 calling for the protection of the air transport industry by the global aviation community. It is incontrovertible that responsibility for curbing the spread of contagious diseases primarily devolves upon States and international organizations concerned. They would at least have a moral obligation to watch the interests of the air transport industry in the face of a global pandemic of avian flu.",

At the time of writing there were 150 confirmed case of humans affected, half of which were fatal. The exact way in which people get infected by influenza viruses is not clear, but most cases appear to involve direct contact between the person affected and the infected bird.

Whereas the impact of SARS was on the demand side, in the form of consumption and the demand for services contracted, 40 a flu pandemic will also affect and impact the supply side, as members of the labour force fall sick and in some cases succumb to the disease. A flu pandemic will also destroy human and physical capital, reducing global growth potential and having a significant impact on the global economy. Furthermore, such a pandemic will make investment drop significantly and will not allow a revival for a long time. Deaths resulting from avian flu will reduce the work force drastically and a widespread pandemic could lower the world GDP by 3.6 points than in a case where there is no pandemic.",

Secondly, this warning gave us ample opportunity to prepare for an outbreak. WHO observed that, since late 2003, the world had progressively moved closer to a pandemic since 1968 when the last pandemic of the twentieth century occurred. WHO also said that, during 2005, ominous changes have been observed in the epidemiology of the disease in animals. 41 WHO advised that, as a response to a pandemic threat, the world should take advantage of the gradual process of the adaptive mutation of the virus and implement early intervention with antiviral drugs, supported by other public health measures. 42 In this regard, measures had already been proposed both by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) 43 along with a draft global strategy. 44 WHO had prepared a comprehensive avian influenza preparedness plan which recognizes that air travel might hasten the spread of a new virus and decrease the time available for preparing intervention. 45 At an international meeting of health ministers held in Ottawa in October 2005, it was stressed that there was a need for a multi sectoral approach calculated to: strengthen the capacity for surveillance; develop a global approach to vaccine and anti-viral policy for research and development; and, above all, achieve full transparency between countries and institutions involved in responding to the risk of a pandemic, while carrying out a global programme to conduct disease surveillance. 46 technology is available to combat an outbreak of flu around the world as States will find it increasingly easier to implement measures once used during the SARS crisis, particularly as both ICAO and IATA carried out an exhaustive programme of action when the SARS crisis erupted. Both Organizations worked closely with WHO during that crisis and are continuing their efforts at present in the context of the new threat to public health. IATA's Medical Advisory Group has worked with WHO to develop guidelines for check-in agents, cabin crew, cleaning staff and maintenance staff. ICAO has already put into action a systemic approach to a possible outbreak of communicable disease. At the 35th Session of the ICAO Assembly, held in September/October 2004, ICAO Contracting States adopted Resolution A 35-12, 48 which declares that the protection of the health of passengers and crews on international flights is an integral element of safe air travel and that conditions should be in place to ensure its preservation in a timely and cost effective manner. Through this Resolution, the Council has been requested to review existing Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) of relevant Annexes to the Chicago Convention and adopt new SARPs as necessary, while maintaining institutional arrangements to coordinate efforts by Contracting States and other members of the international civil aviation community.",

In this context it is not only the State or nation that has an obligation to notify WHO of communicable disease but the human concerned as well, who has an abiding moral and legal obligation.
