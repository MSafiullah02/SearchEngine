These patients showed elevated D-dimer levels, prolonged prothrombin (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) and thrombocytopenia. Another study using thromboelastography to evaluate whole blood from 24 ICU patients showed similar elevated D-dimer. However, they showed normal or increased fibrinogen, platelet count, PT, and aPTT, which is consistent with hypercoagulability than DIC.18 Although both groups of patients were admitted to ICU, these differences may be explained by the stage of the disease. DIC may, therefore, potentially be a late stage of COVID-19. Sepsis is known to cause DIC, and patients with COVID-19 may develop sepsis resulting in DIC. The Sepsis Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) criteria was created by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) to categorize sepsis and coagulopathy. SIC values greater than 4 are associated with greater severity of illness, highlighting the importance of prompt recognition and appropriate escalation.19 Iba et al. proposed a \u2018two\u2010step system\u2019 for the early detection of DIC, with initial screening with the SIC score, and for those who meet this criteria, calculating the DIC score.20 The role of these scoring systems in the context of COVID-19 coagulopathy remains to be demonstrated. The American Society of Haematology report coagulopathy in COVID-19 to be different from classic DIC, with milder thrombocytopenia and lack of microangiopathy seen. However, they recommend the monitoring of platelet count, PT, aPTT, D-dimer and fibrinogen; emphasizing the role of D-dimer as a marker of severity of infection.21\n",

The remaining 139 (76%) were still in ICU. 31% had thrombotic complications despite being on low molecular weight heparin (subcutaneous doses of 2850 IU or 5700 IU per day dependent on body weight or date of treatment ).1 From this study, it is evident that thrombotic complications are high despite thromboprophylaxis. Obi et al. observed during the H1N1 pandemic those with ARDS were at increased risk of VTE. They found that those without anticoagulation were 33 times more likely to develop any VTE than those who were treated with empirical systemic IV heparin anticoagulation (aiming for a target partial thromboplastin time of 50-70 seconds).3 Therefore, a similar approach may be necessary for COVID-19 patients to prevent these complications from occurring.",

Evaluating platelet count may be an affordable and accessible biomarker to assess disease severity and risk of coagulopathies. Similarly, elevated plasmin has been seen in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may be useful as a biomarker in COVID patients.31 The use of point-of-care ultrasound screening for DVT may also be necessary, and others have suggested this in the context of COVID-19 for lung injury.32\n",
