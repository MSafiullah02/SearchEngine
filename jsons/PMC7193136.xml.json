COVID-19 was confirmed to be the pathogenic cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease is highly contagious, and some cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 were rapidly fatal (The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team, 2020The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team, 2020). More than 74,000 cases from 31 provinces in China have been confirmed so far (National Health Commission, 2020). Confirmed cases including those in America, France, Thailand, Japan and twenty other countries have also been reported. On January 27 of 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global vigilance and worldwide surveillance of the outbreak from China, and provided the first edition of infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance, although this interim guidance needs updated information (WHO, 2020). And for COVID-19, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data, especially on temporal progression of abnormal laboratory findings, remains limited. Herein, we report epidemiological information, clinical characteristics, therapeutic outcomes and the temporal progression of laboratory findings in COVID-19 patients exposed to lopinavir (LPV) for use in case management.",

However, the conditions of patients 1 and 2 had no improvement, and were even aggravated after the withdrawal of LPV. The results of SARS-CoV-2-RNA of patient 6 remained positive for four days after that of the other six discharged cases who with continuous use of LPV turned to negative. Noticeably, one severe case (patient 8) received support care and symptomatic treatment after the adverse reactions occurred, rather than stopping LPV, with improvement appearing in two days.

However, a large proportion of our cases presented low levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte and eosinophil in the early stage of COVID-19, particularly that almost all eosinophil values were less than the lower threshold of normal range within the first week of hospitalization. This symptom could not be attributed to glucocorticoid exposure, since seven patients had not received such treatment at initial admission. However, the reduction of eosinophils may be related to a mechanism of stress response in the condition of acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2, which results in inhibiting the release of eosinophils in the marrow through glucocorticoid secretion. Interestingly, there was continuous improvement on eosinophils in the later stage of COVID-19, which was in sync with the symptom of radiographic and virology improvements in all discharged cases, and the time of eosinophil improvement of mild cases was earlier than that of severe cases, which suggests that lower and increasing eosinophils may be the signs of COVID-19 progression and recovery. Combined with the above abnormal indicators, whether these can be regarded as diagnostic characteristics of COVID-19 needs more research to determine. Although such abnormalities existed in the early stage of COVID-19, there was an improving trend of these indicators after receiving LPV-combined regimen. This was further evidence that LPV has a positive effect on the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

More clinical evidence is also needed imminently to assess the efficacy and safety of LPV in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
