The disease and the virus that causes it have been named as COVID\u201019 and SARS\u2010COV\u20102, respectively. In January 2020, the outbreak spread to multiple cities in China, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n Human to human transmission is strongly associated with COVID\u20109 and SARS\u2010COV\u20102. Respiratory droplets and human to human contacts are the main routes of transmission of the virus.\n4\n In the early stages of this disease, symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection occur, with some patients rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other serious complications, which are eventually followed by multiple organ failure.\n5\n Therefore, early diagnosis and timely treatment of critical cases is very crucial. At present, the occurrence, development, mechanism of prognosis and immune status of patients with COVID\u201019 are still unclear. In this study, we have assessed the hematological characteristics of the patients. Also, we have determined the correlation between clinical laboratory data and the severity of COVID\u201019 in adult patients. Moreover, we have determined the predictive value of clinical laboratory data for the severity of COVID\u201019.",

The fluorescent reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm each diagnosis made. Forty\u2010three patients, aged 19 to 70 years (43.74 \u00b1 12.12 years), were recruited for the study. They comprised 17 females and 26 males. Blood samples were collected from each participant and then used for hematological investigations. The patients were then put into two groups in terms of the severity of the disease. Hence, there was a mild group (consisting of 28 patients) and the severe group (consisting of 15 patients). Permission to conduct the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fuyang Second People's Hospital; and informed written consent was obtained from each patient.",

            "text": "This study reported the results of blood routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation function, and infection\u2010related biomarkers of the adult patients with COVID\u201019. We found that WBC, LYM, NEU, MONO counts were not significantly different between the severe group and the mild group. However, Huang et al\n7\n found low lymphocytes and WBC counts in most patients. WBC (the severe group 4.26 \u00b1 1.64 \u00d7 109/L and the mild group 4.96 \u00b1 1.85 \u00d7 109/L) and LYM (the severe group 1.20 \u00b1 0.42 \u00d7 109/L and the mild group 1.07 \u00b1 0.40 \u00d7 109/L) were close to the bottom line of the normal range in many patients in our study results. This result suggests that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS\u2010CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect other cells, induce a cytokine storm in the body, generate a series of immune responses, and cause changes in peripheral WBCs and immune cells such as lymphocytes. Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that CoV consumes many immune cells and inhibits the body's cellular immune function. Damage to T lymphocytes might be an important factor leading to exacerbations of patients.\n8\n The blood biochemistry indices, except for Glu, were not different between the two groups. The median and IQR of Glu in severe COVID\u201019 patients were 7.73 and 4.59 mmol/L in severe patients. Chen et al\n5\n reported the Glu was 7.4 (3.4) mmol/L (median and IQR). It might be because most severe patients have underlying diseases that caused a high Glu level. This study found that coagulation function was significantly different between the severe group (0.49 [0.29, 0.91] \u00b5g/L) and the mild group (0.21 [0.19, 0.27] \u00b5g/L). Wang et al\n9\n found a difference in laboratory findings between patients admitted to the ICU (414 [191, 1324] mg/L) and those not admitted to the ICU (166 [101, 285] mg/L), including higher levels of d\u2010D.\n9\n The results showed that patients with severe conditions would have abnormal coagulation. Coagulation activation could have been related to the sustained inflammatory response. Infection\u2010related biomarkers appeared to differ between the two groups (IL\u20106). However, the proportion of IL\u20106 above normal was (36.10 [23.00, 59.20] pg/mL) in the severe group, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group (10.60 [5.13, 24.18] pg/mL). This was in line with the concept of \u201cCytokine Storm,\u201d which must be experienced by patients with mild illness to become severe, emphasized by Lanjuan Li, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Among these risk factors, the ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in severe COVID\u201019 patients. The AUC of IL\u20106 and d\u2010D were 0.795 and 0.750, respectively, while those of Glu, TT, CRP, and FIB were below 0.750, thus leading to poor predictive value. When IL\u20106 and d\u2010D were jointly predicted, the ROC curve integral of severe COVID\u201019 was 0.840 (P < .01) as good predictors of severe COVID\u201019 under the ROC curve, and the combined detection effect was better. Combined detection was more efficient than independent detection. Logistic regression analysis showed that IL\u20106 and d\u2010D could predict severe COVID\u201019. The combined detection of IL\u20106 and d\u2010D plays a complementary role. The combination of severe COVID\u201019 can be greatly improved by selecting different combinations according to different situations. Early prediction plays an important role. When IL\u20106 was over 24.3 pg/mL and d\u2010D was over 0.28 \u00b5g/L by series test and parallel test, the AUC of the COVID\u201019 with or without the severe was over 0.750, which also confirmed the high prediction efficiency.",

Firstly, the sample size was relatively small compared with Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some impact on the statistical results. Secondly, due to the large\u2010scale outbreak of the epidemic restricting the flow of people, data on healthy patients are lacking as blank controls. Since this study was a retrospective study, not all patients were continuously monitored for all indicators in the blood including IL\u20106 and d\u2010dimer levels. In future studies, data will be collected from healthy patients as blank controls to further explore the predictive value of IL\u20106 and d\u2010dimer for patients with SARS\u2010COV\u20102 infection.",
