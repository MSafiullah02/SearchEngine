In addition, it is about 79% akin to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 50% related to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The latter two coronaviruses have their immediate origins from civets and camels, respectively [4], [5]. Although it is uncertain how COVID-19 transmission from animals to humans occurred, epidemiological studies suggested an intermediary wild animal host sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [6]. Currently, while human to human transmission is certain, the mechanism of transmission remains controversial [2], [7], [8]. Although it is likely that COVID-19 transmission is primarily via droplets and fomite contact, airborne transmission events cannot yet be excluded. Transmission via the faecal-oral route remains a possibility as SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but not live virus, has been detected in stool [9]. Molecularly, like SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely uses ACE-2 as entry receptor, which is highly expressed in the lung and gastrointestinal tract [10], [11], [12].",

Based on current best evidence, supportive treatment and organ support remain the focus of ICU care. Specific treatments such as the use of corticosteroids to control the inflammatory response, and antivirals, particularly the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been used, but are unproven to improve outcomes [1]. The cautionary experience of SARS-CoV provided a lesson of the desperate pursuit to find effective treatment. During this outbreak, the use of high-dose corticosteroids (> 3 g methylprednisolone in the acute phase of disease) used to modulate the immune response was not conclusively shown to improve outcomes, but resulted in devastating steroid induced complications [14].",

Certainly, ICU HCW are at particularly high risk of nosocomial transmission because of potential exposure to aerosolised respiratory secretions during intubation, tracheal suctioning, bronchoscopy and respiratory circuit disconnection, as well as environmental contamination [15], [16], [17], [18]. Thus, it is currently prudent to assume higher precautionary measures in ICU than those currently recommended by the CDC (respiratory droplet and contact precautions). Suspected or confirmed cases should ideally be isolated in a negative pressure airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with sufficient air changes (> 12/h) and personnel trained to use personal protective equipment (PPE) for airborne precautions. All support and sanitary staff, often forgotten, should also receive appropriate PPE and infection control training, particularly as there may be a risk of faecal transmission [9]. If full airborne precautions are not possible due to limited facilities or overwhelming numbers of cases, other measures that may decrease risk of nosocomial transmission include cohorting of patients in dedicated wards, or physical separation, supported by disciplined use of PPE, universal contact and droplet precautions and adequate ward ventilation [15], [19], [20], [21]. Encouragingly, with strict PPE protocols combined with rigorous implementation, the reported risk of staff contracting SARS-CoV in one ICU was low, despite suboptimal physical space, ventilation and complete absence of AIIR facilities [22].",

However, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that there may be an increased risk of viral transmission to HCW who treated patients receiving NIV [18]. Since the mode of COVID-19 transmission remains unclear and mortality benefit of HFNO and NIV in severe pneumonia is unproven, we do not currently recommend their use in suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Preventive measures may include using apnoeic oxygenation during CPR, or careful two-person BVM ventilation to allow an effective face seal by two handed mask holding (with inline bacterial/viral filter), and early intubation when indicated. The use of mechanical CPR devices to replace HCW CPR may reduce the risk of facemask leakage for the HCW, and decreases their own minute ventilation, thus potentially reducing the risk of disease transmission. For patients already receiving mechanical ventilation in ICU, the ventilator may be set to volume control, with a large negative pressure trigger and high-pressure alarm setting to avoid a need for disconnection and change to manual BVM ventilation.",

            "text": "One of the greatest challenges in emerging epidemics is uncertainty amongst HCW about transmission risks, and fear of becoming a victim of the outbreak disease. ICU is a high-risk area where a larger number of \u201chigh transmission risk\u201d procedures are performed. Clear concise communication and leadership are critical to tackle stress, fear, fake news and mistrust during the crisis [32]. Staff morale is vulnerable and emotional support should be proactively made available. Frontline staff must be made to feel safe by constant exposure to clear protocols and rigorous training. Expansion of critical care beds to cope with increased numbers of patients by opening more ICU beds, and converting wards and other monitored areas for ICU provision is often recommended in outbreak disaster plans. However, experience from SARS-CoV showed that rapid and excessive expansion may overwhelm staff, lead to excess infections in HCW, and compromise care [33]. Thus, expansion should be matched by safe staffing to guarantee an appropriate quality of care and staff safety, which necessarily limit expansion. It has been suggested by an expert consensus group with first-hand experience of outbreak expansion that this is realistically limited to a maximum of 50-100% of baseline capacity [34]. Alternatively, restricting normal critical care to provide only core and essential provisions, may allow greater expansion and more patients to have limited life sustaining interventions under conditions of limited resources [35]. Should these measures be overwhelmed, individual patient triage and appropriate rationing of ICU care will be required to provide greatest benefit for the greatest number of patients [36], [37]. A structured triage approach incorporating triage admission criteria that can adapt to the scale of crisis, are fluid and adaptable depending on the evolution of the outbreak and change in response to resource pressures is necessary. A process of development and implementation that provides transparency, an appeal mechanism, documentation of decisions and that is culturally and socially sensitive is recommended [34].",

COVID-19 patients pose risks to ICU staff, but the precise magnitude of this risk is currently unclear. Adequate precautions, good hand hygiene, plentiful supplies of properly fitted N-95 masks and other essential PPE, filters for circuits, clear and robust protocols, teamwork and communication are all needed to address these concerns. ICU management teams have the responsibility to make these needs known to relevant authorities to ensure proper forward planning and adequate procurement.
