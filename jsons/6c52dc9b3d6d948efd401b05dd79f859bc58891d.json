            "text": "Navigating \"Down Time\" During COVID-19 David Fessell , MD, Kim Garver, MD, Frank Lexa, MD/MBA I n an effort to slow the spread of the corona virus, many elective medical procedures, including screening imaging studies have been postponed. As a result, the volume of cases in radiology departments has dramatically decreased. While some radiologists may be extra-busy supporting the new \"schooling at home\" status of their children, and others may now have extra duties caring for an elderly parent without their usual support, many radiologists now have increased down time. Being \"radiologically idle,\" at least in the shortterm, may very well stimulate a desire for meaningful contribution, especially given the increasing volumes of patients infected with COVID-19 and the massive changes in our country and our world. While radiologists may be called upon in various ways as the situation evolves, what positive things can be done with this down time?",

This is part of the Declaration of Geneva that many of us pledged to uphold when we graduated from medical school-\"I WILL ATTEND TO my own health, well-being, and abilities in order to provide care of the highest standard\" (1). If we are run down and do not have energy we cannot help others. The reminder given on every airline flight is true\u00c0put your own oxygen mask on first\u00c0so that you will be able to help others. Positive daily routines can be very helpful in stressful times including setting goals, exercising, maintaining a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, as well as connecting with others. Tracking one's goals helps to provide a sense of progress and accomplishment and for high power professionals is particularly important when their work structure is disrupted. Limiting news and world events updates to specifically scheduled times (perhaps when one is exercising and can burn off the stress) can limit the stressful inputs and promote coping.",

Focusing on those things in our zone of control is empowering and calming (3) . Regular reminders of our personal values-those which provide meaning and purpose in our lives-help to ground us. Such things can include spirituality, religion, meditation, service, and family ties. Sharing these deeper values-those which bring greater meaning to our lives-can also be a very meaningful and lasting way to connect with others, especially now, in the face of constant change.",

Such feelings can include inadequacy, uselessness, guilt for not doing more \"clinically relevant\" activities, perhaps even mixed with occasional feelings of relief that one is not currently on the \"front lines\" in the emergency room or ICU. Loss naturally stimulates feelings of grief and mourning. Uncertainty naturally stimulates anxiety. It may feel as though we are increasingly hijacked by unexpected emotions including frustration and sadness. Naming our feelings, allowing them to be present, and letting them flow through us helps to complete the natural process of navigating traumatic events (3, 4) . Such selfcare, including our emotional and mental health, is essential. Self-care is not self-indulgent-it allows us to support those who rely on us. Social media may be helpful to some, but can heighten fear and worsen depression in others. On-line talks with mentors, colleagues, coaches, spiritual advisors, and mental health professionals are supportive forms of communication and all can be helpful. A regular journaling practice, including what one is grateful for, can also have a positive effect on our well-being (2, 4) .",

It can be a time of deepening the connection with one's partner. Many find it helpful to track one's \"check-ins\" with family members who are not living with you. Family members are often living across the country and having such a system to know one is regularly checking in can ease our minds. Preparing oneself before such calls-by centering and calming ourselves, bringing some positive or encouraging news (dramatically fewer cases in China, progress on a vaccine, etc.) can be helpful. Expecting stress, anxiety, and worry from those on the other end of the call allows us to prepare and bring more support. By providing a listening ear, a bit of hope, and a connection to meaning and purpose, we can deepen the family bonds that help sustain us all.",

Putting a reminder on one's calendar to assess which agencies have needs and to donate to them can help provide a source of continual contribution. Hosting zoom coffee chats, happy hours, and birthday parties with family, friends, and colleagues helps all engender feelings of connection and a sense of belonging.

A recent publication outlined many helpful tips for giving web-based lectures to residents (6) . This can be an especially productive time to complete research papers and write the next grant.
