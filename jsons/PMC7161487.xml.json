Thin layer CT display blood vessels thickened in the lesion (Fig. 1 b).\nCase 2A 21-year-old woman, take the same car with case 1 from Wuhan to Taiyuan. She had fracture of humerus due to car accident, no fever or cough. Chest CT is normal (Fig. 2\n).\nCase 3A 41-year-old man, with a travel history within a week to Xiaogan, China, another city next to wuhan where the COVID-19 was spreading also, presented for fever (38 \u00b0C) for two days. Chest CT (Fig. 3\n) showed consolidation and bronchiectasis in the lesion.\nCase 4A 40-year-old woman, wife of Case 3, returned to Taiyuan from Xiaogan together with Case 3, was admitted to the emergency department due to fever (38.5 \u00b0C), fatigue and cough for two days, with little yellow phlegm, no sweating. Chest CT (Fig S1 a,b) showed sub-pleural fine mesh shadow in GGOs in both lungs,2\n,\n3 The long axis of the lesion is parallel to the pleural surface.\nCase 5A 66-year-old woman, presented with cough for ten days, with little sputum, and the temperature was 37.7 \u00b0C. She lives in the same building with another patient diagnosed as COVID-19. They don't know each other, but share an elevator. Chest CT (Fig S2a) showed sub-pleural fine mesh shadow in GGO in both lower lobes and bronchiectasis in the consolidation of right lower lobe. Sagital reconstruction shows multiple atoll sign (Fig S2b).\n",

It shows a low-density shadow in the center, surrounded by increased density GGO ring. The diagnostic value of this sign in COVID-19 needs to be studied in a large number of cases. Notably, lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent in all of these five patients on CT.",
