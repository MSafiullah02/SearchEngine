However, when medical errors resulting in adverse events are identified and reported, they are infrequently discussed explicitly as errors and occasionally not discussed at all.6 Because diagnosis involves uncertainty and evolves, diagnostic errors, in particular, pose several additional challenges.7 During the discussion, clinicians may debate whether a diagnostic error occurred, what the actual error was, or be disillusioned by the paucity of easy solutions compared with other types of error (eg, medication error).8 Meaningful conversations about diagnostic errors require that clinicians are comfortable discussing and addressing diagnostic errors in a nonpunitive environment and accept accountability for what is within their control.9,10 Local safety culture impacts the ability to identify and learn from diagnostic errors. Clinicians may hesitate to be seen as judgmental of others\u2019 care or fear that professional relationships may be harmed if they bring diagnostic errors to colleagues\u2019 attention.11 These findings underscore the importance of understanding the culture surrounding the discussion of diagnostic errors to identify them better and learn from them.",

Thus, we evaluated clinicians\u2019 comfort in discussing diagnostic error in comparison to other types of medical errors and assessed comfort levels in both confidential peer-to-peer settings and publicly at MMCs. We hypothesized that clinicians would be less comfortable discussing diagnostic errors in MMCs compared with private conversations with peers and that they would be less comfortable discussing diagnostic errors compared with other types of error. We also explored differences in comfort related to clinician type, time in practice, and the clinician\u2019s institution as well as perceived barriers to discussing diagnostic errors in MMCs.",

Three scenarios described errors that hospitals often have standard practices in place to prevent. (1) Laboratory specimens were switched between 2 patients resulting in a delayed diagnosis of leukemia for one patient and an unnecessary referral for the other. (2) The clinician had 2 records open at the same time and ordered laboratory tests on the wrong patient resulting in a treatment delay for one patient and an unnecessary painful procedure for the other patient. (3) The clinician ordered ibuprofen for a patient with chronic kidney disease resulting in a decline in renal function. Two scenarios described diagnostic errors in which the clinician initially diagnosed a common less serious condition but later identified a more serious diagnosis with different times between the initial and final diagnosis: (4) sepsis initially diagnosed as influenza (short time delay) and (5) brain tumor identified after herniation in a patient initially diagnosed with new migraine headaches (long time delay). For all 5 errors, respondents were instructed to assume that they were the clinician caring for the patient when the error occurred. Respondents were asked to indicate their comfort in discussing these errors in private with a colleague and in public venues such as MMCs.",

These analytical weights were created by the institution using iterative proportional fitting procedures.20 Within each institution, the marginal distributions of eligible respondents were known for respondent age, gender, clinician type, and years in practice. Information for these variables for eligible respondents was obtained from the medical staff offices of each participating institution. One institution would not release information regarding the ages of trainees and APPs and the years in practice for all providers; this applied to 163 (4.2%) and 218 (5.6%) eligible respondents, respectively. Because response rates were significantly different across these variables (except gender) and our pilot study demonstrated a relationship between clinician type and several variables of interest,16 poststratification weights were applied to correct for any nonresponse bias introduced into our estimates.21 Additionally, we used the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method to control the type I error rate of the study22; thus, although the significance level was set a priori at P < 0.05, the new critical P value for statistical significance was determined to be P < 0.018.

More notably, clinicians were significantly less comfortable discussing diagnostic errors compared with other medical errors. Although the data did not identify significant differences in comfort relative to clinician type or years in practice, clinicians at Hospital D reported significantly less comfort discussing diagnostic errors compared with peers at other hospitals. The most frequently cited barriers to discussing diagnostic errors in public venues include feeling like a bad clinician, concerns about peer judgment of knowledge base, decision-making, and professional reputation; more than 40% of respondents cited these barriers. Although the frequency of barriers identified was similar across clinicians and institutions, clinicians at Hospital D cited significantly greater concerns about their job being at stake, raising the possibility that institutional culture may influence the willingness to discuss diagnostic errors publicly. Because efforts to reduce harm arising from diagnostic error require that diagnostic errors be discussed to uncover the underlying reasons for the error, these findings are likely to have important implications for health care organizations seeking to reduce patient harm related to diagnostic errors.",

Diagnostic reasoning receives scrutiny during MMCs, where participants often explain their clinical reasoning during the diagnostic process.27 Clinical reasoning and system errors are both frequent topics of forums like MMCs.28,29 System problems and clinical reasoning errors usually coexist when diagnostic errors occur,30 but the degree of direct clinician responsibility varies depending on the type of error. In an ethnographic study of individual accountability in patient safety, Aveling et al12 assert that individual clinicians are integral to the system in which they practice as \u201cthey create, modify and are subject to the social forces\u201d of patient safety culture. Their study demonstrated that while forums like MMCs contributed positively to maintaining standards of professional competence, such benefits were often thwarted by conditions that made individual clinicians fearful of challenging peers about their performance, especially when individuals were harshly blamed for situations largely beyond their control. Similarly, Danielsson et al31 found that physicians perceive an individual duty to contribute to patient safety through efforts to improve clinical decision-making. However, they acknowledge that cultural norms that expect error-free clinical decision-making from physicians negatively affect their willingness to discuss mistakes to learn from them.31 A culture that is not open to discussions about mistakes is a barrier to accountability and improvement.32 As clinicians are the agents of diagnosis, they are central to efforts to reduce diagnostic errors and should participate in the analysis needed to uncover lessons to both improve systems and improve individual clinical reasoning.8 Therefore, efforts to enhance diagnostic safety will need to address cultural forces that impede frank conversations regarding diagnostic reasoning while simultaneously strengthening the system to reduce the risk of diagnostic errors.",

For example, physicians and residents in one study were less likely to discuss medical errors if they held fears about harm to their reputation due to an error.41 In another study, MMC participants perceived a more blaming culture in MMCs where errors were examined without accurate analysis compared with MMCs in which errors were not discussed at all; this difference in perception of a blaming culture disappeared, however, when participants felt that the error was accurately analyzed.42 Creating safer environments for error discussions requires understanding the sources of misgivings held by clinicians.",

Creating a clear, consistent case review format moderated by trained facilitators increases attendee engagement and the perception of transparent unbiased analysis in MMCs.44,45 Although such improvements seem to improve psychological safety indirectly, transparency depends on a nonblaming culture. Our results suggest that fear of criticism regarding knowledge base or decision-making are significant barriers to open discussions of diagnostic error. Gonzalo et al46 demonstrated that a consistent, expertly facilitated systems-focused MMC improves resident perception of blame-free case reviews. Blame is also avoided by presenting cases anonymously; anonymous case presentation significantly reduces the perceived punitive nature of MMCs.47 However, this study failed to show a concomitant reduction in the perceived focus of MMC on individual clinician error. Yet, individual clinician decision-making contributes to diagnostic error and requires feedback to promote improved diagnostic performance. Meyer and Singh48 acknowledge that diagnostic performance requires feedback to calibrate both team and individual diagnostic performance. Regular, well-explained, corrective feedback, including opportunities for performance improvement provided by peers, significantly correlates with psychological safety among individual providers.49 Although intentional structural improvements provide specific techniques to promote psychological safety in MMCs, the latter finding and our data showing greater comfort discussing diagnostic errors privately with peers underscore the need for complementary, private, honest discussions of diagnostic errors with trusted colleagues.",

However, the frequency of making diagnostic errors as reported by respondents to this survey is consistent with findings from these prior studies.17\u201319 The current study is the largest to date to explore pediatric clinician comfort with discussing diagnostic error; it includes more clinicians than the 3 previous studies combined and is the first to include APPs. The response rate was also substantially higher than that of pediatric clinicians responding to the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture38; additionally, we used poststratification weighting to account for nonresponse bias. Only tertiary referral academic centers participated; thus, these findings may not be broadly generalizable. However, clinicians at all participating institutions cited barriers to discussing diagnostic errors with similar frequency, suggesting that practice location may not be a major influence despite the noted difference concerning fears of job loss at 1 center. We did not collect information about the size, frequency, audience composition, or facilitation of MMCs at the participating institutions, and these characteristics may have influenced participants\u2019 responses.",

Our results confirmed our hypothesis that pediatric clinicians are significantly less comfortable publicly discussing diagnostic errors compared with other medical errors. This lack of comfort may be related to concerns about their psychological safety in venues such as the MMC. Although the most common barriers to these discussions seem relatively universal, clinicians at some institutions identified more concern regarding job security. The greater comfort during private peer-to-peer discussions represents a potential opportunity to bolster psychological safety.",
