            "text": "Intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL) is a rare multisystem disease characterized by proliferation of malignant lymphoid cells within the lumen of small blood vessels. This disorder has been classified as a subtype of large B-cell lymphoma, although rare forms with a T-cell phenotype do exist. The cause of the impaired capability of the malignant lymphocytes to extravasate has remained unclear, and a lack of homing receptors and adhesion molecules including CD29 (\u03b21 integrin) and CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) has been hypothesized. The association of IVL with other solid lymphomas has been described, suggesting a possible link between them.",

The clinical presentation is highly variable, and the diagnosis is often difficult and delayed. Patients usually present with B symptoms including fever, night sweats, malaise, and unexplained weight loss. Fever of unknown origin could be the presenting feature in 60% of IVL, while skin lesions and neurologic symptoms are also common. Skin lesions may encompass a wide range of morphologies and distributions, including eruption, nodule, papule, ulcer, and plague with associated induration, desquamation, hemorrhage, or telangiectasia. A broad spectrum of neurologic symptoms can be seen in patients with IVL, including dementia, delirium, seizures, myeolopathy, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and a range of focal signs including aphasia, hemianopsia, and blindness. Any organs may be involved, individually or in combination, but liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow are relatively spared until late in the disease.",

Anemia and thrombocytopenia are commonly observed. IVL also rarely presents with DIC. The pathogenesis of DIC in IVL is poorly understood. The proposed mechanisms include the secretion of procoagulants by the lymphoma cells, and direct interaction of between lymphoma cells and the endothelial cells. There is no pathognomonic clinical, laboratory, or radiologic feature for IVL, and its diagnosis requires histologic confirmation. Histologically, the lumina of the small and intermediate-sized blood vessels are distended by noncohesive, large, atypical mononuclear cells. These cells usually possess round nuclei, vesicular chromatin, prominent nucleoli and a rim of amphophilic cytoplasm. The malignant cells in IVL are usually emeshed in fibrin or platelet thrombi, and are sometimes associated with florid endothelial proliferation, resulting in glomeruloid structures. The resultant vascular occlusion can lead to multiple-site infarction of the involved organs, especially in the brain.",

Diagnosis can be made by transbronchial biopsy if there is lung infiltrate. Diagnosis can also be made by skin biopsy for skin rash, splenectomy for splenomegaly, or renal biopsy for proteinuria. There have been reports of incidental diagnoses made by surgical resection of benign prostate hyperplasia or cervical polyp. Although PET might occasionally localize abnormal proliferation of malignant IVL cells in some of the cases, the lack of focal aggregation of malignant cells in IVL in most of the other cases make IVL difficult to be detected even with PET. Moreover, the bone marrow is usually spared until late in the disease; hence, bone marrow examination is often unhelpful in the diagnosis. In the absence of focal lesion, some authors have reported the success of using random skin biopsy and muscle biopsy to evaluate the possibility of IVL.",

Nearly half of the patients had a relapse after initial chemotherapy. Autologous stem-cell transplantation was successful in several relapsed cases. The reported median survival was only 5 months from presentation. Prognostic analysis demonstrated better survival in patients with the \u201ccutaneous\u201d variant, good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status \u2264 1), early stage of disease (stage I-E or single extralymphatic site), and the use of chemotherapy.",

Immunohistochemical study revealed positivity of the lymphoma cells for CD20 (B-cell marker) and negative for CD3 (T-cell marker). Similar findings were revealed in the heart (Figure 3\n), brain, liver, spleen, pancreas, thyroid, kidneys, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, and mesenteries.
