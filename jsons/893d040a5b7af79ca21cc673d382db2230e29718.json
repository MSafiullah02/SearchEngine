This complex relationship between virome and the human host may have direct effects on health, directly conditioning the presence and replication of pathogens and the organism responses. An example is the ratio of virotypes to bacterial phylotypes that is approximately 10:1 [Kim et al., 2011] . Indeed, integration as a prophage into bacterial cells, provides a protection from superinfection \"immunizing\" the bacterial host against the same or a closely related phage. Moreover, genes encoded by the phage may expand the capability of bacterial host by enabling, for example, metabolism from new nutrient substrates, providing antibiotic resistance, conveying virulence factors, or influencing bacterial host gene expression [Reyes et al., 2012] .",

            "text": "In the gut virome, we can find not only fully adapted human viruses, but also the presence of some animal viruses transmitted by the ingestion of contaminated food, with an unclear relationship with human virome. Above all, HEV is a cause of acute hepatitis; genotypes 1 and 2 are human-specific but types 3 and 4 have a reservoir in pigs. Genotypes 1 and 2 are common in humane virome, genotypes 3 and 4, which very frequently infect humans from the animal reservoir, might be adapting to humans [Smith et al., 2013] . Differently from pigs, where the infection is silent, acute infection in humans is frequent and the HEV can be considered zoonotic virus. In this framework arise that the host immune status play a key role in the determination of clinical features and in the virome composition [Lhomme et al., 2012] . The situation is even less clear for gyroviruses. Within the Circoviridae family, only the chicken anemia virus (CAV) was previously known as a member of this genus until recently. The first gyrovirus in humans (HGyV) was initially found by NGS at the surface of the skin of healthy people [Sauvage et al., 2011] . A very similar virus, AGV2, was found a few months later in chickens, and then a third gyrovirus was detected in human stool, in which CAV and HGyV/AGV2 were also identified [Phan et al., 2012] . A fourth gyrovirus, GyV4, was also found in China in chickens and in human stool [Chu et al., 2012] . Some reports reveal a high frequency of these four gyroviruses in human stool, possibly owing to cross-species transmission of gyroviruses and their replication in humans, or alternatively to passive transit of animal viruses via food intake, as has been observed for plant viruses [Zhang et al., 2006] . Within the Circoviridae family the cycloviruses constitute a new genus, and are found in the feces of humans and other animal species, posing similar questions as gyroviruses . More recently plant viruses (such as pepper mild mottlevirus (PMMV), oat blue dwarf virus, and others) have been described. They can affect the intestinal bacterial quali-/quantitative composition and its functioning [Scarpellini et al., 2015] .",

Normal postnatal maturation of the gut microbiota is perturbed in SAM; children living in Malawi and in Bangladesh have gut microbiota with bacterial configurations that appear younger (more immature) than the microbiota of chronologically age-matched individuals with healthy growth phenotypes. The authors identified age-discriminatory viruses that define a growth model of phage and eukaryotic components of the gut virome, which is delayed when subjects developed SAM. Such growth model may be useful for forecasting normal versus perturbed postnatal maturation of the gut virome component in populations at risk for malnutrition.",
