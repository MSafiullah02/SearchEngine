It causes severe diseases in humans and livestock throughout Africa 1 and the Arabian Peninsula 2 . RVFV is also considered to be a potential bioterrorism agent. In the last few decades, Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks have been reported in eastern and southern Africa (e.g. Kenya, Somalia, United Republic of Tanzania, Madagascar and South Africa). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In contrast, there have been very few reports on the recent occurrence of RVF in western and central Africa. Significant high-and low-prevalence clusters of RVF in sub-national areas on the African continent have been reported. 8 Since the spread of RVFV largely depends on the mosquito vectors and the translocation of animal hosts, an endemic situation usually occurs in the restricted geographical areas inhabited by their hosts and vectors. In Nigeria, RVFV antibodies have been found in sheep, goats, cattle, horses and camels in the northern states of Kaduna and Sokoto 9 and in the plateau area 10 suggesting that the virus may be enzootic in Nigeria. In addition, serological studies conducted on human sera have confirmed the existence of the disease in Nigeria. 11 The specific geographical location of Borno State in northeastern Nigeria, which shares international borders with three other African countries (Cameroun, Chad and Niger), makes it vulnerable to the transboundary spread of various diseases, including viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs). In addition, Borno State has been reported as the niche for Lassa fever virus (LASV) and possibly other VHFs. However, the epidemiology of RVF and other VHFs has not been extensively investigated in Borno State. A detailed and accurate investigation of the seroprevalence is necessary to ascertain the occurrence and spread of RVF in this area. RVFV possesses a single-stranded tripartite RNA genome composed of three segments: S, M and L. The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and non-structural (NS) protein, using an ambisense strategy. The M segment encodes the precursor for the glycoproteins Gn and Gc and two non-structural proteins of 78 kDa and 14 kDa. The L segment encodes the L protein. 12 The nucleotide sequence of the NP gene is highly conserved among various RVFV strains. 13 Serum antibodies against NP are readily detected early after infection and in convalescent individuals, providing a basis for the diagnosis of RVF. 14, 15 The traditional diagnostic assays for VHFs are based on immunoassays that use live viruses as the source of capture antigens. The use of highly attenuated RVFV (RVFV-MP12) does not require stringent biosafety measures and could readily be adopted in laboratories in developing countries where infrastructures for biosafety level 3 or 4 containments are lacking. The usefulness of recombinant viral nucleoprotein (rNP)based serological assays, such as IgG-ELISAs and immunofluoresence assays (IFAs) for the detection of antibodies against VHFs such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and LASV have been reported.

Single serum dilution (1:50) assay rather than titration by endpoint dilutions was performed in order to establish a high-throughput screening of NAbs.

Since recombinant protein-based immunoassays with high sensitivity and specificity have been demonstrated to be useful for the diagnosis of VHFs in humans, [15] [16] [17] 25, 26 we have used rNP-based IgG-ELISAs for the detection of serum antibodies against RVFV, LASV, and CCHFV. Of the 297 serum samples tested for RVFV-IgG, a total of 42 (14.1%) showed positive results ( Table 1 ). The antibody prevalence observed in this study is in agreement with the results of a surveillance study carried out in the 1980s, when 14.8% of the sera collected in more than 30 locations throughout Nigeria were found to be positive for a hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody against RVFV. 11 In this study a significant difference in the prevalence of antibodies was observed (RVFV rNP-ELISA [14. 1%], LASV rNP-ELISA [7.4%] and CCHFV rNP-ELISA [2.4%]), and the highest prevalence was noted for RVFV rNP-ELISA antibody. In addition, more than 12% of the samples tested had NAb activity against RVFV. These results indicate that RVFV is more actively circulating in the study area compared with LASV and CCHFV. It is therefore important to undertake a risk assessment of RVFV infection in humans in Nigeria. RVFV is transmitted through contact with body fluids from infected humans and animals or by mosquito bites and/or aerosols. The particular location of Borno State, with its shared geographical borders with three other African countries, indicates that a regional epidemiological study should be conducted not only in the LGAs in Nigeria, but also in the neighboring countries, to identify the possible risk factors for transboundary RVFV infection. The borders are porous and unrestricted human and animal Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene trafficking across borders is common throughout the year. In spite of the active circulation of RVFV observed in this study, no outbreak of the disease in humans or animals has been reported in the study area. This could be as a result of poor surveillance for the outbreak of the disease or a lack of expertise in disease recognition. 10, 11 It is also possible that RVFV circulating in the region is a non-pathogenic strain. RVF in humans usually begins with a nonspecific influenza-like acute fever, but can progress to serious hemorrhagic fever in some cases. VHFs, particularly Lassa fever, an acute viral hemorrhagic fever caused by LASV, has been reported to be endemic in Nigeria. 27, 28 The symptoms of the disease also vary from a non-specific febrile illness to fatal viral hemorrhagic fever. Therefore, there is the possibility that patients with non-specific febrile illness caused by RVFV infection could be misdiagnosed with other endemic infectious diseases, such as malaria, typhoid fever or Lassa fever. A VSV-based pseudotype system has been designed to enable the high-throughput screening of NAbs against viral infections. 29 We also developed a novel serum neutralization test using RVFVpv to detect serum antibody against RVFV. The reliability and usefulness of the assay were evaluated by comparing the results of the assay with those obtained from the widely used 'gold-standard' neutralization assay using infectious RVFV. Of the 43 serum samples that showed more than 75% neutralization by the RVFVpvbased assay, 11 were negative by the conventional RVFV-MP12 neutralization assay (Table 2 ). It is possible that the results of 11 negative samples were due to false-positive reactions in the VSV-RVFVpv-based assay. However, among these serum samples, one showed a higher OD 405 value (0.443) than the cut-off OD 405 value at 1:400 dilution, and another one was identified as a positive by the rNP-based ELISA, with OD 405 values of 1.318 and 0.364 at the 1:400 and 1:1600 dilutions, respectively (Supplementary Table 1 ), indicating that the serum contained antibody to RVFV. Another possibility is that the VSV-RVFVpv-based assay was more sensitive than the standard neutralization assay using RVFV-MP12. This assumption is supported by the observation that the NAb titers measured using pseudotyped VSV bearing the GP of Nipah virus or SARS-coronavirus are higher than those obtained by using infectious viruses. 21, 29, 30 The ROC and TG-ROC analyses indicated an appropriate cut-off value for the percent neutralization (75%) to demonstrate that the NAbs in the sera had high sensitivity and specificity. The conventional assay for measuring NAbs requires serial-dilutions of the test serum and takes several days for the virus to replicate to a level which results in plaque-forming or cytopathic effects in infected cells. However, the new assay based on RVFVpv uses a single serum dilution (1:50) and has a quantitative nature, where the luciferase activity can be determined one day after inoculation onto cells. Finally, pseudotyped VSVs do not produce infectious progeny viruses, thereby ensuring their safe use as diagnostic tools.
