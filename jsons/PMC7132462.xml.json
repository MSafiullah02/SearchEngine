The preanalytical phase of synovial fluid evaluation encompasses the steps from initial sample collection through final arrival and accessioning at the diagnostic laboratory. Unfortunately, preanalytical variables can drastically alter samples submitted for evaluation to veterinary laboratories and it is considered the stage at which most laboratory error occurs.1 Specific variables that may influence the interpretation of joint fluid mostly involve technical factors, such as selection of collection materials, evidence of blood contamination, and specimen handling. Other considerations that should be included with sample submission include the location that was aspirated, the signalment and presenting signs of the animal, and current medications being administered. With consistent preanalytical quality control and reporting of specimens, downstream clinical decision making and management of patients can be accelerated and improved. General practitioners should always feel comfortable contacting a diagnostic laboratory for specific information regarding sample acquisition, processing, and submission.2, 3\n",

These cells are either phagocytic and thus similar to macrophages (type A synoviocytes), or they produce hyaluronic acid, a glycosaminoglycan (type B synoviocytes).4 Both types of synoviocytes can be visualized on cytologic preparations of synovial fluid, but are typically difficult to differentiate in normal joints and are classified together as large mononuclear cells.",

It is recommended that direct smears be made immediately following sample collection and before any additional processing. This prevents artifacts or misinterpretations due to sample aging, concentration, dilution, or contamination.2, 3 A rough estimation of total nucleated cell count (TNCC), differential counts, characterization of any unusual cells that may be present, as well as a subjective assessment of the proteoglycan background, are all possible to evaluate from a direct smear, alone. Indeed, direct smears are often preferred over cytocentrifuge-prepared slides for differential cell counts, as some researchers feel that the latter may not provide an accurate representation of cell proportions and that the morphology of the cells may be altered during centrifugation.2, 19 In particular, a diagnosis of suppurative inflammation can be reliably made using direct smears.20 If sample quantity allows, recommended additional tests include TNCC (obtained via automated or hemocytometer methods), total protein, and mucin clot test.

This tends not to be a problem, however, when the joint is diseased and the synovial fluid is dilute. To address thick samples, hyaluronidase can be added to synovial fluid before slide preparation. It is recommended that 150 IU/mL hyaluronidase be mixed with an equal volume of joint fluid and incubated for several minutes before direct smear slide preparation.19 When used, it is suggested to use gentle smearing technique, as the hyaluronidase treatment tends to cause the cells to become more fragile.",
