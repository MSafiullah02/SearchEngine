The other amino acids in the variable (Fv) domain are known as framework residues and act as a scaffold to support the loops. The VL and the VH, the CH1 and the CL, and the 2 CH3 domains are paired; the 2 CH2 domains have carbohydrate side chains attached to them and are not paired. The folded constant domains may be homologous among different species, allowing hybrid domains (eg, mouse-human) to be produced. The variable domain confers specificity and affinity. The CDR amino acid sequences are extremely variable and play a large role in interaction with the targeted antigen. The chain type, region, and distance from the amino terminus characterize the domains. Thus, CH2 domain refers to the second constant domain of the heavy chain.",

Whereas the myeloma cell imparts immortality to the hybridoma allowing cells to be cultivated indefinitely, the immune spleen B-cell confers antigen specificity. Because each hybridoma is derived from a single cell, the cells within a hybridoma cell line are identical and make the same antibody molecule with same antigen-binding site and isotype, hence it is called a MAb. Among several excellent reviews that detail MAb production with hybridomas is a recent review by Dean and Shepherd.12 Initial attempts to bypass the mouse to make human MAbs involved fusion ofhuman immune spleen lymphocytes with nonsecreting human myeloma partners to obtain hybrid cells that continually secrete a specific antibody. However, poor fusion of human myelomas, unsatisfactory performance of the hybrid cells, and the difficulty in accessing immune lymphocytes have prevented success. Although heteromyelomas\u2014which are fusions of human and mouse myelomas\u2014work better, these hybrids are usually unstable. Attempts to use mouse myeloma cells to create hybrids and derive human MAbs led to the loss of human chromosomes and the inability to make human Igs.13\n",

Thus, the search for an ideal fusion partner for generating human MAbs has been difficult, which is why the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) technique for immortalization of B lymphocytes is preferred. But immortalized B cells do not always replicate exactly the in vivo antibody response, because the tissues from which these cells were selected and the manipulations to which they are subjected to in the laboratory may alter the antibody specificity.14., 15.

Antibody genes are linked to bacteriophage coat protein genes and the bacteriophages with the fusion genes are used to infect bacteria to create the phage display library. The resulting bacteriophages express the fusion proteins and display them on their surface, and the phage display library comprises recombinant phages, each displaying a different antigen-binding site on its surface. The phage expressing an antigen-binding domain specific for a particular antigen can be detected and isolated by binding to the surface coated with that antigen. Libraries of VH and VL genes may be generated from nonimmunized donors, immunized donors who have an immune response against a particular antigen or from a synthetic library consisting of antibody fragments.20., 21.\n",

Generally, chimeras combine the human constant regions with the intact rodent variable regions, replicating the rodent antibody variable regions by PCR and then cloning them into eukaryotic expression vectors containing human constant regions.49 Ideally, this allows better interaction with human effector cells and the complement system. Because the Fc region has little influence on the structure of the Fv region, the chimeric constructs\u2019 affinity and specificity are virtually unchanged, and both rodent and chimeric antibodies cause apoptosis at a similar rate and intensity against target cells in vitro.50., 51., 55. Although chimeric antibodies have helped solve some of the problems associated with the use of rodent MAbs, they still show significant immunogenicity in humans; because of their approximately 30% mouse sequence, they cause an human-antichimeric antibody response.",

The most effective mechanisms are blockade of a crucial ligand or growth factor or ADCC in which tumor cells are killed by Fc receptor-bearing cytotoxic effectors. Cell killing by ADCC is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to a cell, whereas the blockade of an essential growth factor may not show effects until most of its receptor is saturated. A higher antigen expression by the target cell will increase antibody binding and subsequent ADCC. But high receptor expression will also make it difficult to prevent the binding of a cytokine or ligand at minimum threshold.53., 59., 63.\n",

MAbs can be conjugated to chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, mitomycin, and methotrexate. Chemotherapeutic agents constitute cytotoxic or cytostatic drugs that can be conjugated to antibodies; thus far, however, these drugs have shown poor specificity for target cells and frequently lead to toxicity.55., 62., 65. Often, antibodies may lose reactivity upon conjugation with such agents. Immunotoxins used in cancer therapy are conjugated antibodies that combine plant (ricin, gelonin, saponin, abrin, pokeweed antiviral protein) or bacterial (diphtheria toxin and pseudomonas toxin A) toxins with antibody specifici ty.52., 59., 62., 63., 65., 66., 68., 69.

The antigen-antibody heteropolymer complexes are then transported to the liver and spleen, where the complexes are destroyed by macrophages, whereas the red blood cells return to the circulation unharmed.72., 73., 74., 75. A wide variety of conditions, of both autoimmune and foreign origin, may potentially be treated with this method, including HIV infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, Marburg virus infection, and myasthenia gravis.76., 77., 78. Although mouse antibodies are currently being used with this technique, chimeric mouse-human antibodies could also be constructed.72 It may also be possible to use the heteropolymers as \u201csentinels\u201d by injecting them before antigen exposure. In 1 recent study, multiple infusions of heteropolymers provided nonimmunized monkeys with protection against an antigen (\u03a6174) for as long as 2 weeks.79\n",

However, early clinical trials were disappointing.80., 81. Producing MAbs to tumor antigens is a complex process. First, proteins peculiar to human cancer cells are identified; then, mice are injected with human tumor cells (antigen) to stimulate an immune response. After about 30 days, the mouse lymphocytes are removed and fused with myeloma cells to isolate and reproduce hybrid cells specific to a predetermined antigen. Rodent antibodies alone have been used in several trials, but the clinical effects are often minimal because of poor activation of human effector or complement cells by the Fc region of the murine antibody and the accompanying HAMA responses.55., 57. Substituting the rodent Fc region with a human Fc fragment may help overcome these effects.81\n",

Recently, it was reported that daclizumab, a humanized anti-IL-2a antibody, was an effective complement to dual immunosuppression therapy in renal transplant patients.101 Because only activated cells express IL-2, antibodies to this cytokine might inhibit T cells during allograft rejection and prevent generation of cytotoxic T cells. The development of HAMA response in patients and the decreased effectiveness of murine MAb relative to human MAb have thus far compromised the effectiveness of this approach. However, humanized anti-Tac MAbs, with better human effector functions, may survive longer in vivo and may prove less immunogenic than its murine counterpart. Short-term CD4 antibody therapy may also contribute to long-term acceptance of skin and islet allografts, even after gaining immunocompetence.102\n",

Unfortunately, this may inhibit many cytokines, which can impair the patients\u2019 ability to fight infection and increase the risk of secondary sepsis; also inhibiting a few cytokines may not be sufficient. Although MAbs targeted toward components of the host immune system, such as individual receptors or mediator cells, help in the treatment of septic shock, targeting the bacterial endotoxin or lipid A of gram-negative bacteria with MAbs may be more efficacious. Lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, a component of the outer cell membrane of Gramnegative bacteria, consisting of a highly variable O-linked polysaccharide chain, an R core region, and lipid A, which in turn is composed of a glucosamine disaccharide backbone substituted with amide- and ester-linked long-chain fatty acids, is believed to be important in many cases of septic shock and septicemia, and can trigger an inflammatory cascade that can cause serious injury and even death.119., 120. Lipid A is linked by the core region to the O-linked side chain, and variations in the O-linked side chains result in an enormous diversity among Gram-negative bacteria, making adoptive immunotherapy against the O-linked antigenic determinants difficult.114\n",

A human IgM, HA-1A (Centoxin) is derived from a heterohybridoma fused from spleen cells of a patient vaccinated with E coli J5 before splenectomy.116., 117., 119., 121. Both the antibodies have thus far shown mixed success in patients with sepsis and neither is currently cleared by the FDA for therapeutic use. Because patients with bacteremia often have endotoxemia, HA-1A, an IgM antibody to endotoxin may be effective against endotoxin in the bloodstream as well. Unfortunately, the high cost of antibody ($3500/dose in Europe) combined with the uncertainty that the sepsis is caused by Gram-negative bacteria has hindered the widespread use of HA-1A.112., 115., 117. Although it is less efficacious, the only other option may be to target TNF\u03b1, but 1 recent study reported a high (54.1%) rate of adverse reactions in patients receiving an anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody.118 The antibody was no more effective than the placebo given to control subjects.

Passive immunization has been shown to reduce the severity of CMV and prevent mother-to-infant transmissions.122 Moreover, antibodies may be able to clear the virus from infected tissues, a function previously thought to be exclusive to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Many physicians use a combination of antiviral agents and immunoglobulins in patients at risk for CMV infection. MAbs may also decrease the amount of antiviral agents required for treatment.

Experiments in mice, for instance, indicate that microgram quantities of antibodies may promote healing of corneal opacity and blepharitis caused by herpes simplex.133 However, attempts to confer immunity in humans and other higher animals by passive immunization alone have been disappointing, because antibodies to HSV are restricted to only a few specific epitopes.133 Among the 11 glycoproteins expressed by the herpes virus on its surface, 5 glycoproteins (gB, gD, gH, gK, and gL) are thought to be crucial to infection. The initial step in HSV infection seems to be the binding of gC to heparan sulfate proteoglycans followed by the binding of gB, and the binding of gB and gC is stabilized by gD. gH is involved in initiation of viral fusion and other glycoproteins may help in expanding the fusion process.",

MAbs can target at least 7 different antigenic sites on HSV glycoprotein D in the murine model.133., 134. Glycoprotein D is necessary for virus replication in tissue culture. Yamamoto et al135 reported the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity effect of HS1, a neutralizing MAb to glycoprotein B of HSV, in athymic nude mice inoculated with HSV intracutaneously. When HS1 is administered, the skin lesions healed in 50% of the mice given the antibody. Also, latent infection in the ganglia was prevented in mice that survived, as evidenced by the failure to detect HSV upon co-cultivation with Vero cells. Administration of HS1 after development of zosteriform lesions (5 to 9 days after infection) reduced the virus in the ganglia and prolonged survival time; however, the disease was not totally avoided and eventually the mice succumbed to the disease. The antibody therapy could prevent or decrease the severity of herpetic keratitis, iritis, and blepharitis after corneal infection by HSV.136., 137. Thus, MAbs could potentially be used to prevent congenital herpes and sexual transmission of the herpes virus.47., 133., 138., 139.\n",

IgG antibody specific for digoxin is purified and cleaved into Fabs, because the smaller molecular mass of the fragments allows faster renal clearance and more rapid action than the whole antibody. The Fab fragments bind to circulating digitalis molecules and generate a complex that is unable to bind to receptors. Adverse effects are rare, and the immunotherapy is generally effective against digoxin and digitoxin within 1 hour.120141 However, because polyclonal antibodies may be difficult to produce and may cause hypersensitive reactions, researchers have attempted to develop humanized MAbs against digoxin and other toxins.141 For example, 1 group has used a transgenic mouse to produce hybridoma-secreted human MAbs against digoxin.141 More recently, the effect of goat anti-colchicine IgG antibodies has been studied in mice exposed to a lethal intraperitoneal dose of anti-inflammatory colchicines, and preliminary studies in a 25-year-old woman with colchicine poisoning showed promise.102., 141.\n",

It is linked to violent psychotic episodes that are similar to schizophrenia.149 Treatment is difficult because there is no known antagonist identified, PCP has a high volume of distribution, and about 95% of it is cleared after being metabolized.151 Recently, MAbs have been described that could bind to cocaine or PCP and act like sponges in the bloodstream to prevent them from reaching the brain.152 It has been shown that a single dose of antibody reduced PCP effects for up to 2 weeks in animals, which might be equivalent to a several months in humans. High-affinity antibody 6b5 fragments against PCP function better in that the fragments with bound PCP are more quickly cleared from the body than the whole antibody-bound PCP.153 The crystal structure of the antibody fragment complexed with PCP has been studied in detail.154 Antibody fragments are also preferable to whole antibodies in the treatment of PCP addiction because of their lower antigenicity and improved pharmacokinetics.149., 151. Anti-idiotype antibodies could potentially be produced against the drug-MAb binding site and mimic drug structural features, although these antibodies do not cross the blood-brain barrier.151 By increasing protein binding in the vascular compartment and lowering the drug\u2019s volume of distribution, the antibody acts like a pharmacokinetic antagonist.150 Evidence that the antibody can also reverse effects of other potent arylcy-clohexylamine drugs suggests that antibody medications can be used to treat different classes of drugs.150., 151. An anti-PCP IgG has been produced from a hybridoma cell line using both ascites and bioreactor methods, and the pharmacological and immune specificity of the antibody has been confirmed by administering the anti-PCP fragment to rats in three different studies without producing observable effects in behavior.155 Active immunotherapy against methamphetamine addiction is also being contemplated.156\n",

            "text": "About 200 years have elapsed since Edward Jenner vaccinated a young child against smallpox. Since that time, the field of immunology has evolved at a rapid pace and has yielded many critical developments. Although vaccination has thus far proven to be the most cost-effective method of preventing diseases worldwide, the development of MAbs that use the specificity of immunological responses is one of the most successful applications of immunology to date. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have reduced the risk of allergenicity from exposure to nonself antibodies and heightened the clinical effectiveness of MAb treatments. Developments in radiology and pharmacology have allowed radiolabeled and immunoconjugated antibodies to be produced. Antibody fragments, heteropolymers, and bispecific antibodies are now available in addition to whole MAbs. These promising developments may soon allow MAbs to be used to treat afflictions as varied as substance abuse, cancer, asthma, viral infection, septicemia, and poisoning. As Heddy Zola observed in 1995, \u201cThe therapeutic application of MAbs, whilst still limited in scope, promises to break its substantial shackles and realize the potential forecast by its proponents.\u201d46\n",
