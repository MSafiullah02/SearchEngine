The different virus families have genomes formed by dsDNA or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), dsRNA or ssRNA, with (1) positive, negative, or ambisense polarity, (2) circular or linear topology, and (3) single or multipartite genomes. ssRNA and dsRNA viruses must provide an appropriate RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate their genomes, and RNA duplex replication intermediates are usually synthesized during viral infection. dsRNA is nonetheless a potent signal for the induction of intracellular defense mechanisms in higher eukaryotes,2, 3 and viruses have adopted different dsRNA sequestration mechanisms. dsRNA viruses never release their genome from a specialized capsid with an unusual T\n = 2 symmetry, where both the positive and negative strands are synthesized but freshly synthesized transcripts are extruded into the cell cytoplasm to be translated.4 Positive-strand RNA viruses limit the negative-strand synthesis to very low levels, and replicative intermediates containing dsRNA regions are scarcely accumulated. Furthermore, many plant and insect positive-sense RNA viruses express a dsRNA-binding protein that acts as a potent suppressor, inhibiting host RNA silencing.5, 6 In contrast, negative-strand viruses, which need massive amounts of both positive-stranded RNA and negative-stranded RNA to be used as messages and progeny genomes, usually prevent formation of an RNA duplex by shielding the genomic (\u2212) ssRNA with the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, forming a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex.7, 8\n",

For that, dsRNA band mobility shifts were analyzed under native conditions in the absence of SDS (Fig. 3a, left) and under denaturing conditions in the presence of 0.1% SDS (Fig. 3a, right). A scheme showing the macromolecular complexes analyzed is given in Fig. 3b. The existence of a single band of defined mobility demonstrated the structural integrity of the virion particles (Fig. 3a, lane 1). Purified dsRNA segments A and B were observed as two well-defined bands (Fig. 3a, lane 2). dsRNA from SDS-treated virions, in which all interactions are broken except for covalent links, was visualized as two retarded bands under denaturing conditions, indicating the presence of VP1\u2013dsRNA complexes (VPg\u2013dsRNA; Fig. 3a, lane 3, right). VPg\u2013dsRNA complexes nonetheless appeared as an unresolved band with a large smear if SDS is absent in the agarose gel (Fig. 3a, lane 3, left). Filamentous particles identified as the putative IBDV RNP (i.e., VPg\u2013dsRNA complexes shielded by VP3 molecules) gave rise to two bands with a more reduced mobility, as well as another band that migrated similarly to intact virions in native conditions (Fig. 3a, lane 4, left). Finally, in denaturing conditions, RNP behaved like VPg\u2013dsRNA complexes (the two faster migrating bands) and intact virions (the slower migrating band) (Fig. 3a, lane 4, right). Western blot of these agarose gels containing the purified virions, dsRNA molecules, as well as crude preparations of VPg\u2013dsRNA and RNP complexes, using anti-VP1 (\u03b1VP1), anti-VP2 (\u03b1VP2), and anti-VP3 (\u03b1VP3) antisera, confirmed their biochemical composition (Supplemental Data).",

This C-terminal tail was predicted to be well exposed and disordered and consequently able to bind proteins and nucleic acids. VP3 may be considered an example of a moonlighting protein that can carry out multiple, apparently unrelated functions.32 Moonlighting proteins represent a means of increased complexity for viruses with limited coding capacity. Although the mechanisms of classical moonlighting rely on the use of separate surfaces for binding different partners and/or catalyzing distinct reactions, VP3 uses close or overlapping interaction regions to exert diverse effects. Reports are becoming more frequent of intrinsically unstructured proteins that are able to perform several functions,33 as predicted here for the VP3 C-terminal region, which is invisible in the reported atomic structure of VP3, similar to the C-terminal domain of a transcriptional corepressor, CtBP.34 Switching mechanisms among these VP3 functions are poorly understood. Coordination of their activities might be achieved by conformational changes in partner-induced processes (pVP2, VP1, dsRNA, or some combination of these), variations in oligomeric state, transient folded/unfolded states, local concentration of a ligand at the viroplasms, or a combination of these possibilities.",

The IBDV core RNP morphology is somewhat reminiscent of that of the nucleoproteins of certain dsDNA viruses. Polyomavirus and papovavirus (e.g., SV40) are icosahedral particles that contain within their capsids a mini chromosome in which circular dsDNA is folded into nucleosomes by cellular core histones. Similarly, the adenovirus core contains a copy of linear dsDNA; it has no cellular histone but has virus-specific proteins.

Nevertheless, in this scenario, VP3 might compact the genome at the interior capsid through intermolecular interactions. The ability of VP3 to oligomerize supports this hypothesis; under certain conditions (i.e., in the presence of glycerol or Mg2+), we detected thicker RNP filaments (not shown). Definition of RNP and VPg\u2013dsRNA complexes at two well-defined electrophoretic mobility bands implies that, in addition to the covalently bound VPg, all dsRNA molecules have the same number of VP3 molecules. The most abundant class of IBDV particles is formed by the E5 population that encapsidates four dsRNA segments such that each segment is bound to \u223c 110 VP3 molecules, yielding a ratio of 26 bp/molecule of VP3 (Luque, D., Rivas, G., Alfonso, C., Carrascosa, J. L., Rodr\u00edguez, J. F. & Cast\u00f3n, J. R. (2009). Infectious Bursal Disease Virus: an icosahedral polyploidy dsRNA virus. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. In press). This ratio, calculated assuming that 100% of VP3 molecules are bound to dsRNA, is relatively low as compared with the nucleocapsid protein of the paramyxovirus Sendai virus, which is bound to six ribonucleotides.37 We are also working on the functional analysis to determine at what ratio the RNP properties become evident. The appearance of the RNP of negative-sense (e.g., filovirus, rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, and orthomyxovirus) and positive-sense (e.g., coronaviruses) ssRNA viruses is highly variable, depending on salt concentration, deletion of specific C- or N-terminal regions, and/or the presence of specific ions. These RNPs form constrained, tightly packed coils with a fairly uniform diameter or flexible, extended linear structures.38, 39, 40\n",

Reaction products were thawed at 37 \u00b0C, supplemented with 1% SDS, heated at 100 \u00b0C for 3 min, incubated (1 min, 4 \u00b0C), and digested with 0.2 mg/ml of proteinase K (2 h, 37 \u00b0C). Radioactive nucleotides not incorporated into nascent chains were removed using Microspin S-200 HR Sepharose columns (GE Healthcare). Reaction products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and detected with a Storm gel imaging system (Molecular Dynamics). Data were quantitated with Quantity One software (BioRad).",

Micrographs were recorded with a JEOL 1200 EXII electron microscope operating at 100 kV at a nominal magnification of \u00d740,000.(2)Metal shadowing. Sample adsorption was as described above, except for dsRNA and VPg\u2013dsRNA samples, which were adsorbed in 10 mM and 20 mM magnesium acetate, respectively. They were then air dried and transferred to a Balzers 400-T stage (Bal-Tec AG). Samples were shadowed rotationally with \u223c 60-\u00c5 platinum at an angle of 3\u00b0, and the replica was reinforced with an \u223c 2-nm carbon layer. Samples were visualized with a JEOL 1010 JEM electron microscope operating at 80 kV, and images were recorded with a Bioscan 792 charge-coupled device camera at a nominal magnification of \u00d740,000, giving a pixel size of 1.14 nm.(3)Immunogold labeling. RNP complexes were applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated grids for 2 min to identify VP3 on their outer surface. The grids were then blocked with 5% BSA\u2013PBS for 10 min. Polyclonal rabbit \u03b1VP3 antiserum (1/100 in 0.1% BSA\u2013PBS) was incubated for 10 min, followed by three washes with 0.1% BSA\u2013PBS. Protein A conjugated to 5-nm gold particles (1/50; Biocell) was added to the grid for 10 min. Samples were washed twice with PBS and six times with water to eliminate nonspecific binding. The grids were metal shadowed as above.\n",

Dialysis of IBDV virions against low-salt buffer in the presence of EDTA renders structurally preserved RNP (constituted by dsRNA, VP3, and VP1/VPg) and soluble capsid protein subunits of VP2/pVP2 (left arrow); treatment of these RNP crude preparations with SDS releases VP3 and noncovalently bound VP1 subunits as soluble components and VPg\u2013dsRNA complexes. Treatment of these crude VPg\u2013dsRNA preparations with proteinase K would eventually render dsRNA molecules.
