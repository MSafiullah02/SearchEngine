            "text": "Ebola viruses (EBOV) belong to the family Filoviridae in the order Mononegavirales. These viruses cause a severe hemorrhagic fever, termed Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), with fatality rates as high as 90% (Feldmann et al., 2003). The fourth gene of the EBOV genome encodes the precursors of a soluble non-structural glycoprotein (pre-sGP) and the structural transmembrane glycoprotein (pre-GP) (Sanchez et al., 1996, Volchkov et al., 1995). Pre-sGP is the primary product and is processed by signalase and furin cleavage into sGP and \u0394-peptide (Volchkova et al., 1999), both of which are secreted. sGP has been detected in the serum of infected individuals (Sanchez et al., 1996) and is hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of EHF (Feldmann et al., 2003). Pre-GP undergoes similar processing to yield the mature viral spike protein GP1,2, which consists of the two disulphide-bonded cleavage fragments GP1 and GP2 (Sanchez et al., 1998, Volchkov et al., 1998). sGP shares the 295 N-terminal amino acids with GP1 but has a unique 28 amino acid carboxyl-terminus, whereas pre-GP is only expressed after RNA editing (Volchkov et al., 1995). Despite the large region of shared primary sequence, these proteins are markedly different in their structure, with sGP forming homodimers (Volchkova et al., 1998, Barrientos et al., 2004, Falzarano et al., 2006), which according to the more recent studies seem to exist in a parallel rather than an anti-parallel orientation, and GP1,2 forming trimers (Sanchez et al., 1998). These proteins also differ in their function; GP1,2 has been shown to mediate virus entry (attachment and fusion) (Feldmann et al., 2001) while sGP, besides additional yet unknown functions, might have an anti-inflammatory role (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005). As part of our efforts to characterize the structure of sGP (including co- and post-translational modifications) for future functional studies, we recently demonstrated that in contrast to GP1,2, which is heavily N- and O-glycosylated (Feldmann et al., 2001), sGP carries solely N-linked carbohydrates (Falzarano et al., 2006). Here we discuss the discovery of a novel type of glycosylation, termed C-mannosylation, which has yet to be identified for any viral protein. Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) sGP was found to possess a C-mannose on tryptophan (Trp) residue 288 (W288). A mutant sGP lacking this modification was unaltered in its biosynthesis, processing, structure and potential anti-inflammatory function. This raises the question as to whether C-mannosylation of sGP has functional consequences or if it is a fortuitous occurrence due to the parasitic nature of viruses in mammalian cells.",

            "text": "sGP peptide mapping by MALDI MS and HPLC-MALDI MS was performed as previously described following trypsin digestion (Falzarano et al., 2006). Two unmodified tryptic peptides containing amino acids 288 to 291 (WAFW) were found: T26 (VNPEIDTTIGEWAFWETK) and T26 + T27 (VNPEIDTTIGEWAFWETKK) (Fig. 1A). The presence of a peptide with a missed cleavage is typical when there are two adjacent cut sites (KK) and in this case results in two peaks separated by \u223c 128.095 Da. Both peptides showed + 162 Da adducts, consistent with the mass of a hexose residue (162.053 Da, Delta Mass\u2014a database of protein post-translational modifications, http://www.abrf.org/index.cfm/dm.home). A comparison of the relative intensities of the non-modified peptides and their respective + 162 Da adducts (Fig. 1A) suggested that approximately 60% of the peptides were modified. MALDI MS analysis allowed all four of the fragments to be observed simultaneously, while HPLC-MALDI MS analysis introduces an additional retention time shift for the + 162 Da modified species\u2014they elute \u223c 1 min earlier under the chromatographic conditions used. This finding is consistent with the addition of a hydrophilic sugar moiety to a hydrophobic Trp residue. The identification of this post-translational modification was further supported by the presence of the recognition sequence, W-x-x-W, for C-mannosylation at amino acid position 288 to 291 (W-A-F-W) of sGP, which was part of both peptides.",

A complete series of y ions (y2 to y6) confirms that W291 is unmodified, while all y ions starting at y7 have a mass increase of 162 Da. This is a strong indication that a mannose residue is attached to W288. Furthermore, the characteristic 120 Da loss (Furmanek and Hofsteenge, 2000) that occurs during CID of mannosylated peptides was also observed (Fig. 1C).

This is not unexpected as others have reported that C-mannosylation occurs in multiple tissue types from diverse species (Krieg et al., 1997, Doucey et al., 1998). In addition, sGP purified from ZEBOV-infected Vero cells was shown to contain the C-mannosylated peptide T26 following HPLC-MALDI MS (Fig. 2C), but in contrast to the transfected cell lines, only C-mannosylated peptides were detected. To confirm this result, the peak corresponding to C-mannosylated T26 was selected for MS/MS which yielded results identical to Fig. 1C (data not shown).",

This potential anti-inflammatory role of sGP is structure dependent (Falzarano et al., 2006) and currently the only functional test for this protein. It has been suggested that C-mannosylation may play a role in protein folding, especially involving folding around disulphide bonds. The location of the C-mannosylated W288 is in close proximity to the cysteine residue involved in one of the intermolecular disulphide bonds (C306) important for the formation of sGP homodimers (Barrientos et al., 2004, Falzarano et al., 2006). As observed previously (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005), treatment of endothelial cells with TNF-\u03b1 leads to a decrease in transendothelial resistance (TER), which can be partially reversed by sGP (Fig. 4\n). The same rescue effect was also observed when endothelial cells were treated simultaneously with TNF-\u03b1 and sGP-WXXA (Fig. 4), demonstrating that the lack of C-mannosylation of W288 did not alter this biological function of sGP, although it may still be important for another as of yet unidentified function.",

Only proteins that enter the endoplasmic reticulum are considered to have the potential to be C-mannosylated; therefore, protein sequences containing W-x-x-W were run through the SignalP 3.0 server in both NN and HMM modes to predict whether they could possess a signal peptide. This predictive modeling gives a yes/no (NN) or a predicted signal peptide/non-secretory protein/signal anchor prediction (HMM). From this analysis, 373 viral proteins were predicted to have signal peptides, indicating that they may have the potential to be C-mannosylated. Among these, EBOV GP1,2 contains 3 potential C-mannosylation sites, which are highly conserved in all 4 EBOV species, including one in the same position as sGP, due to the similarity in the primary sequence of the two proteins (see introduction and Feldmann et al., 2001). Further candidate proteins for C-mannosylation can be found among RNA viruses and include the single transmembrane proteins vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G, Borna disease virus (BDV) G and Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF) GC, the hemagglutinin and M2 proteins of influenza virus, the E2 protein of SARS-coronavirus, the spike proteins of other human coronaviruses and the envelope proteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and 2 (Table 1\n).

Replacement of the second Trp with a Phe residue reduces the efficiency of C-mannosylation 3.5-fold (Krieg et al., 1998). The C-mannosylation synthesis pathway, which appears to be enzymatically catalyzed by proteins present in liver microsomes (Doucey et al., 1998, Krieg et al., 1998), has been dissected and is as follows: Mannose (Man) \u2192 \u2192 GDP-Man \u2192 Dolichylphosphate-Man (Dol-P-Man) \u2192 (C2-Man-Trp) (Doucey et al., 1998).",

It appears that for RNase2, as well as the six polypeptides from the complement system, the hydrophilic mannose residue fills a cavity formed by the main and side chain atoms of a loop on an exposed region of the protein, thus playing a structural role (Mosimann et al., 1996). It has also been suggested that the C-mannose may be involved in protein transport as mutations in the W-x-x-W motif of the erythropoietin receptor and MP20 (a bovine lens protein that is C-mannosylated at W43 and W61) stall the transport of these proteins in the ER-Golgi interface or the ER, respectively (Hilton et al., 1996, Perez-Vilar et al., 2004).

In many cases, post-translational modifications are essential for the function and/or regulation of a given protein. Previous work has shown that sGP was able to reverse the permeability increasing effect of TNF-\u03b1 on endothelial cells and partially restore endothelial barrier function (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005). This finally provided us with a functional assay system for sGP that was recently used to demonstrate that the activity of sGP is critically dependent on its structure as maintained by correct intermolecular disulphide bonding (Falzarano et al., 2006). Here we introduced a point mutation into sGP that is sufficient to abolish C-mannosylation and thus may alter the structure of sGP. However, our investigations did not reveal changes in the biosynthesis, transport, structure or function of the mutant sGP-WXXA compared to wild-type sGP (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Moreover, the potential anti-inflammatory effect of sGP (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005) might not be the sole function, as it has been suggested by others that sGP may play a role in immune evasion by acting as a decoy molecule for EBOV-specific humoral immune responses or bind to neutrophils and subsequently inhibit their activation (Ito et al., 2001, Yang et al., 1998). Unfortunately, these proposed functions have been difficult to prove directly.",

            "text": "The vast majority of the viral proteins that contain a W-x-x-W motif and have the potential to be C-mannosylated are surface glycoproteins (Table 1). With this in mind, the modification of sGP may be an anomaly resulting from the unique manner in which this protein is generated as the product of unedited transcripts from the glycoprotein gene of EBOV (Feldmann et al., 2001). While not excluding a role of C-mannosylation on sGP function, it could be that C-mannosylation may impact on the function of the EBOV transmembrane glycoprotein GP1,2. This protein contains multiple potential C-mannosylation sites with two located adjacent to the predicted transmembrane region of GP2 and one on W288 of GP1, which is identical to the one on sGP. The location of a C-mannose on the extracellular portion near the membrane is not unprecedented as bovine lens protein MP20 also contains this modification in a similar location (Perez-Vilar et al., 2004). The location of a C-mannosylation site just inside the transmembrane region of the BDV G and on the extracellular portion of the VSV G may further indicate that this modification is important for the orientation of membrane proteins or trafficking of viral membrane proteins to the cell surface, as has been suggested for C-mannosylated mammalian proteins (Ervin et al., 2005, Hilton et al., 1996). Alternatively, C-mannosylation of viral proteins could also be a chance event due to the parasitic nature of mammalian viruses that highjack the cellular machinery to complete their life cycle; however, we find this unlikely.",
