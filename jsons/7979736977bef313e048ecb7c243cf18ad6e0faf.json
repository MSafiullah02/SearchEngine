Telemedicine is feasible and acceptable for use in HIV-infected persons and is an effective way to expand HIV care, particularly in rural or remote settings [6, 7] and among hard-to-reach populations, such as those who are incarcerated [8] . Telemedicine can reduce transportation barriers in urban areas, including traffic, long travel distances, or limited access to transportation; and, improve engagement in care and medication adherence, resulting in reduced HIV viral load [6, 8] . Telemedicine can also allow providers to increase patient volume providing access to care for more patients [6, 9] . Telemedicine also has the potential to extend the reach of LGBTQ-affirming care more broadly, particularly for those who are less likely to seek in-person care because of concerns about disclosure, stigma or parental notification [10] . Despite a robust and growing evidence base for telemedicine for HIV care, telemedicine has not previously been scaled for HIV care in most settings. However, the COVID-19 crisis has prompted more widespread adoption of telemedicine, including for HIV prevention and care visits. In this paper, we review a new LGBTQ + clinic's transition to telemedicine and implications for providing HIV prevention and care services via telemedicine during COVID-19.",

Patients are scheduled over the phone, receive a text message with a Zoom link prior to their visit, check-in with front desk staff on Zoom, and then meet with providers in a private Zoom room. Patients complete preappointment paperwork in the electronic medical record patient portal; this includes consent forms, demographic information, and social and medical histories. Providers conduct encounters as they would in office, but substitute physical exams with visual assessments, patient self-exams and self-collected vital signs. Patients also submit pictures via an encrypted email connection if images are required for assessment or treatment. Telephone-based encounters are We refer patients with urgent laboratory needs to our laboratory providers, and we have suspended non-essential laboratory testing for HIV + patients with stable viral loads. For HIV care, the clinical team reviews cases for complexity and designs care plans accordingly. Most cases have been appropriate to see via telemedicine at 3 to 6 months intervals, though we anticipate that complex cases may require more frequent in-person care. These decisions are consistent with current guidelines and best practices. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends testing HIV viral load and CD4 for HIV patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens every 3-4 months [12] ; however, data suggests extending care visits to 6 months or 12 months has no significant impacts on 12-month viral suppression for patients who are virally suppressed, report good adherence, and have no other comorbidities [13] .",

Additionally, payers and the Ryan White HIV program have allowed patients to obtain 90-day supplies of critical medications, such as ART and PrEP [21, 22] . These structural adjustments have dramatically enhanced access to clinical services and essential medications for HIV prevention and care.",
