A pathologic Chest X-ray showed a lower correlation (rho = 0.442; p=0.035). Other laboratory and inflammatory markers showed a good correlation with IL-6: CRP (rho = 0.604; p=0.002), Procalcitonin (rho = 0.504; p=0.024), Ferritin (rho = 0.579; p=0.005), AST (rho = 0.635; p=0.001) and LDH (rho 0.695; p<0.001). The highest correlation was found with the respiratory rate (rho = 0.789; p<0.001) and NT-proBNP (0.990; p=0.001). These patients were more prone to receive an anti-IL-6 therapy (rho = 0.612; p=0.002). The IVC moderately correlated with levels of pO2, expiratory (rho = -0.539; p =0.014) and inspiratory (rho = -0.527; p =0.017), with troponin I (rho = 0.509; p=0.03).
