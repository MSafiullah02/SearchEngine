According to the World Health Organization, approximately 55,000 people die from rabies each year worldwide [3], [4]; this total includes more than 3000 people in China [5]. China is second worldwide in terms of the number of rabies-related deaths. Because the mortality rate for rabies is nearly 100% once clinical symptoms appear, the most effective way to prevent the spread of rabies is through inoculation with a vaccine [2]. Previous studies have shown that domestic dogs are responsible for over 95% of human rabies cases [6] and that the immunization of >70% of all domesticated dogs may be sufficient to prevent rabies transmission to humans and avoid a rabies epidemic [7], [8].",

            "text": "Most commercial rabies vaccines for human and veterinary use in China are inactivated cell culture vaccines. Inactivated cell culture vaccines are safe and easy to use and store. However, at least 3 injections are required to provide a sufficient virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) titer (at least 0.5 IU/ml), which is a reliable indicator that immune protection against rabies virus infection has been achieved [9], [10]. In fact, the rabies neutralizing antibody titer is the most reliable indicator of immune protection [11]. Previous studies have shown that nearly one-third of dogs that received only one injection of a commercial rabies vaccine failed to produce a VNA titer of 0.5 IU/ml [12], [13], [14], [15]. The use of multiple injections translates into higher costs and therefore becomes unaffordable for developing countries. Similar circumstances exist for humans. Most human rabies vaccinations are given post-exposure [9], so the rapid generation of an antibody response following rabies vaccination is very important. The current post-exposure prophylaxis schedule requires at least 4 injections to be effective, and rabies immune globulin is required in serious cases [10]. Vaccine adjuvants are widely used to accelerate and boost immune responses. Aluminum hydroxide is a commonly used vaccine adjuvant; however, its contribution to early antibody responses is limited, and it may cause side effects in some cases [16], [17], [18], [19]. In addition, some studies have shown that aluminum hydroxide may even delay early antibody production [20]. Interestingly, previous records in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia describing the use of aluminum hydroxide in human rabies vaccines were deleted from its fifth edition. Therefore, a novel adjuvant must be developed to increase the effectiveness of the inactivated rabies veterinary vaccine to provide better immune coverage for domestic dogs. This in turn should help block rabies transmission to humans and if approved for human use, could reduce the dosing schedule required for post-exposure prophylaxis.",

Post-exposure immunization is the main immunization method used in human. The incubation period for rabies can be as short as one week, and rabies immune globulin is needed in severe cases [1]. The recommend dose for equine rabies immune globulin is 40 IU/kg [34], which translates into a need for 2000 IU to 3000 IU of equine immune globulin per individual. In other words, at least 2 vials or doses of rabies immune globulin are required per case. The cost of such a treatment regime is barely affordable for the inhabitants of developing countries. The cost for one dose of equine rabies immune globulin in Cambodia, a developing country in Southeast Asia, ranges from US$20 to US$35. This is far too expensive for the farmers living in the rural areas of Cambodia, whose monthly income is typically less than US$80 [35]. Although the dose recommended for human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) is only 20 IU/kg, but the cost of HRIG is even more expensive. Post-exposure prophylaxis may also fail if insufficient immune globulin is used or if the immune globulin is used improperly [34], [36]. Such scenarios occur in developing countries because of their lack of skilled physicians. Thus, because of the high cost of rabies immune globulin, improving the antibody production rate is critical for generating a post-exposure rabies vaccine that is effective for human use, especially in developing countries. An adjuvant that can accelerate the generation of antibody responses and induce cellular immunity would be optimal. Aluminum hydroxide, a traditional, widely used adjuvant, stimulates the immune response by inducing Th2 responses, prolonging the exposure of an antigen to the immune system and delaying antigen clearance from an immunization site [16], [17], [37]. These mechanisms contribute only slightly to early antibody responses and cellular immunity. Furthermore, side effects, such as severe inflammatory and nervous system concerns, may appear in certain cases. Polysaccharides are emerging as a new type of adjuvant that can be used to stimulate a rapid immune response, thereby serving as a highly valuable vaccine addition.",

RR1, an (1 \u2192 4)-\u03b1-d-glucan with a molecular weight of 550 kDa that was isolated from Tinospora cordifolia, has been shown to activate lymphocytes in vitro and stimulate their secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, but not their secretion of IL-2, IL-4 or IL-10 [39]. IIP-A-1 is a (1 \u2192 4)-\u03b1-glucan with a molecular weight of only 3600 Da. IIP-A-1 was evaluated in the current study for its capacity to serve as an immune stimulator. To accomplish this, splenocytes were isolated and cultured in vitro, and the levels of secreted IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 were assessed; in all three cases, secretion was significantly enhanced (IL-2, p\n = 0.006; IL-4, p\n = 0.000; and IL-10, p\n = 0.036). We also measured rabies-specific VNA titer, the most important gauge of the effectiveness of a rabies vaccine. We found that mice that received IIP-A-1 as a vaccine adjuvant had significantly higher VNA titers against the rabies virus than did mice that received aluminum hydroxide on days 21 and 28 post-immunization (p\n21\n = 0.003 and p\n28\n = 0.045). Cellular immunity also plays an important role in resistance to rabies infection and may clear the rabies virus from the CNS [40]. Th1 cells, which are derived from CD4 cells, secrete type 1 cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3, which possess antiviral activities and stimulate CD8+ cell proliferation [41], [42]. Additionally, Th2 cells, also derived from CD4 cells, secrete type 2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10, which induce helper activity in B cells and stimulate the humoral immune response [43]. These cytokine profiles indicate that RR1 mediates immunity via the Th1 pathway, while IIP-A-1 mediates immunity via the Th2 pathway.",

            "text": "Arabinogalactans are highly branched polysaccharides that can easily dissolve in water; these molecules have high molecular weights and consist of l-arabinose and d-galactose moieties [44]. Several studies have shown that the adjuvant activities of arabinogalactans largely depend on their molecular weights, chemical structures and polysaccharide chain conformations [45], [46]. ResistAid\u2122, an arabinogalactan product isolated from the larch plant with a highly branched structure and a 1 \u2192 3,6-\u03b2-d-galactan backbone, is composed of arabinose and galactose units in a volumetric ratio of 6:1. Its adjuvant qualities in relation to IgG production were tested orally in a double-blind parallel-group study evaluating the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. No signs of toxicity or side effects were observed when ResistAid\u2122 was used at a dose of 4.5 g/day for 10 weeks in healthy volunteers [30]. Larch plant arabinogalactans also appear to have low toxicity, as no side effects or signs of toxicity were apparent in either mice or rats when they were administered at a dose of either 5 g/kg or 500 mg/kg for 3 months [47]. In the current study, another arabinogalactan, IIP-2, which was isolated from the roots of I. indigotica, was evaluated. IIP-2 possesses a 1 \u2192 3,6-\u03b2-d-galactan backbone similar to that found in larch arabinogalactans. Its adjuvant qualities were assessed using the inactive rabies virus rCVS-11-G. We first measured the rabies-specific antibody response, the most important indicator of vaccine efficacy. The results of an FAVN test showed that mice treated with IIP-2 had significantly higher VNA titers than mice treated with aluminum hydroxide after a second vaccination (p\n21\n = 0.000, p\n28\n = 0.009, and p\n42\n = 0.036). A few studies have reported that arabinogalactans can enhance the effectiveness of cellular immune responses. For example, G1-4a, an arabinogalactan isolated from T. cordifolia that has a chemical structure similar to IIP-2, was shown to activate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in vitro and spleen dendritic cells in vivo. Secretion of the cytokines IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 from BMDCs and T cell stimulation also increased [29]. In the current study, we evaluated antigen-specific cellular immune responses by ELISpot and ICS. Our results indicate that IIP-2 can activate spleen cells and stimulate them to secrete IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3. These findings suggest that IIP-2 can mediate immune responses though both the Th1 and Th2 pathways. Flow cytometry analysis showed that mice treated with IIP-2 had higher numbers of activated T and B lymphocytes in their blood and lymph nodes than control mice. The results of challenge and post-exposure immune tests showed that IIP-2 mixed with rCVS-11-G could protect mice from a challenge with a lethal street rabies virus strain.",
