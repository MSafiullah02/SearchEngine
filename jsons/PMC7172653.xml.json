            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are caused by numerous viruses. In humans, viruses are major factors in the aetiology of respiratory infections. Among them are RNA viruses, such as orthomyxoviruses (influenza viruses A, B and C), paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus), coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1 and SARS viruses), human rhinoviruses (HRV), and some human enteroviruses (HEV). DNA viruses, such as adenoviruses (Heikkinen and Jarvinen, 2003) and, probably, the parvovirus Bocavirus (Allander et al., 2005), are also involved. Influenza A, B and C viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are enveloped viruses with a segmented single-stranded RNA genome (Lamb and Krug, 2001). The detection of respiratory viruses can be improved through the application of molecular biology techniques. Numerous studies have developed and evaluated PCR- or reverse transcription-PCR-based methods for the detection and typing of respiratory viruses (Cram et al., 1999, Freymuth et al., 1997), although none combine three broadly targeted influenza PCRs in a real-time PCR format.",

            "text": "Influenza A and B virus infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The three influenza types, A, B and C, are divided based on antigenic differences in their nucleoproteins (NP). Matrix (M) proteins have also been used for wide-range classification (Widjaja et al., 2004). Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes based on antigenic differences of the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Currently, there are 16 distinct HA (H1\u2013H16) and 9 NA (N1\u2013N9) subtypes. Three subtypes of HA (H1\u2013H3) and two subtypes of NA (N1 and N2) are found among influenza A viruses that have caused epidemics among humans (Gregory et al., 2002). Influenza A virus HA and NA glycoproteins undergo gradual point mutations known as antigenic drift. In contrast, antigenic shifts are saltatory evolutionary events due to reassortment of RNA segments from different subtypes in co-infected cells. Influenza B and C viruses display a lower variability than influenza A viruses, and human strains with antigenic shift have not yet been observed (Murphy and Webster, 1996). However, B and C viruses are represented by a smaller number of sequences than those from influenza A, which might bias the judgement of their variability. Although study of influenza C is lacking, it is known to cause both trivial and more serious respiratory diseases (Matsuzaki et al., 2005). Possible animal reservoirs of influenza B and C are not completely known and should be investigated.",

The current subtypes of influenza A viruses found in humans include two HA subtypes (H1 and H3) and two NA subtypes (N1 and N2). During the past few years, sporadic human cases of infection with other subtypes of influenza A, including H5N1, H5N2, H7N7, H7N3 and H9N2, which are all hosted by birds, have been reported (Fouchier et al., 2004, Kuiken et al., 2005, Ogata et al., 2008, Saito et al., 2001, Tweed et al., 2004). It is feared that these occasional transmissions to humans could develop into a major influenza pandemic. It calls for comprehensive diagnostic techniques.",

Commercial immunofluorescence (IF) and immunoassay kits for detection of influenza viral antigens allow for rapid diagnosis. These are clinically useful, but are less sensitive and specific than appropriately designed PCRs (Herrmann et al., 2001, Schweiger et al., 2000), which are the most sensitive means of influenza virus detection and may also allow for subtyping of the virus (Donofrio et al., 1992, Herrmann et al., 2001). Virus isolation is less sensitive than PCR, but allows for a more complete characterisation of the virus, including its sensitivity to drugs, and is vital for ongoing global influenza surveillance.",

The three types were originally defined based on their nucleoprotein differences. This gene is, therefore, a logical target sequence. To achieve the goal of broad targeting the highly variable influenza A target sequence, we developed a new kind of probe, MegB. MegB allows for the use of very long and mismatch-tolerant nuclease-degradable probes. Such probes are hard to synthesise as conventional TaqMan\u00ae probes because of the necessity to introduce an internal quencher in a long oligonucleotide.",

This method is further referred to as 3QPCR. The 3QPCR method and its results are elaborated in the Supplementary Material. Due to a few false negative results with a few influenza A samples and the InfluANP-probe, a new broadly targeted probe (MegB) was designed. In further developments using 3QPCR-MegB, rTth polymerase was replaced with the iScript one-step RT-PCR kit for probes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) because a lower amplification efficiency and lower fluorescence signal was attained when rTth was used. However, UNG cannot be used with iScript because it interferes with reverse transcription in this enzyme mixture. The iScript kit was used in further experiments with 3QPCR-MegB. Primer and probes for influenza B and C were the same as for 3QPCR. The primers for influenza A were also the same, but the probe was changed to MegB. 3QPCR-MegB was carried out in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl containing 25 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 RT-PCR reaction mix for probes, 5 \u03bcl of RNA extract, a final concentration of 500 nM of each forward and reverse primer, 150 nM of a dual-labelled fluorogenic probe for influenza A, B and C viruses, respectively, and 1 \u03bcl of iScript reverse transcriptase. The subsequent RT step was performed at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, immediately followed by an initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. A total of 55 cycles were then performed, each consisting of a denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s and an annealing-extension step in which the annealing temperature was 56 \u00b0C for 30 s in the first two cycles and was then decreased by 2 \u00b0C every second cycle down to 46 \u00b0C, according to the touch-down principle (Korbie and Mattick, 2008, Mohamed et al., 2006). Fluorescence data were collected during each annealing-extension step in the FAM channel for influenza A virus, the ROX channel for influenza B and the Cy5 channel for influenza C. Negative and positive PCR controls were included in each analytical round. 3QPCR-MegB was performed using the Corbett Research RotorGene Real Time Amplification system (RG 2000; Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW Australia). RotorGene\u2122 software version 6.4 (Corbett Research) was used for threshold selection and standard curve interpolation to derive approximate RNA concentrations relative to RNA and DNA standards. The term \u201cgenome equivalents\u201d is preferable to the term \u201ccopies\u201d. Here, this term refers to the concentrations interpolated from the standard curve of 10-fold dilution series of synthetic influenza A, B and C target DNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 1A\u2013D).",

This search was reiterated in January 2006 to check for new sequence variants. Another check was performed in 2008. The searches were made in the entire \u201cViruses\u201d subset of GenBank. The presentation options \u201cquery anchored with identities\u201d and \u201c-v 8000 -b 8000\u201d were specified to ensure that all sequence variants were included in the output alignment. The reference strains of influenza A, B and C that were used for querying the database were AY684707, NC002208 and M17700, respectively. The BLAST alignments were examined by ConSort\u00a9 to detect conserved regions suitable for primer and probe construction. Conserved stretches were found in the NP gene. One pair of degenerate primers was designed for each influenza type to amplify a fragment of 152, 119 and 100 bp for influenza A, B and C, respectively. A score cutoff of 46 was set in order to include influenza sequence hits belonging to the same virus type and exclude hits from other influenza types and other viruses. Conserved regions were also aligned using CLUSTAL W 1.83 and were analysed with ConSort\u00a9. During this process, a few new influenza A variants with mismatches occurring at the 3\u2032 end of both forward and reverse influenza A primers were found in GenBank. We then tested the primers with and without these 3\u2032 nucleotides (i.e., forward 5\u2032GARRTYATAARRATGATGGA3\u2032 and 5\u2032GARRTYATAARRATGATGG3\u2032, and reverse 5\u2032ATTGTCTCCGAAGAAATAAGA3\u2032 and 5\u2032ATTGTCTCCGAAGAAATAAG3\u2032). The C\nt values for 10 reference influenza A strains and ten clinical samples (H3N2) were the same, within half of a C\nt step (data not shown). We cannot state that the shorter primers will perform as well as the original, one-nucleotide longer primers for all of the samples. However, an equal mixture of shorter and longer primers at the same final primer concentration, as reported in Table 1, also gave the same result. Thus, a safe way of handling this ambiguity seems to be using an equimolar mixture of the two primer variants for both forward and reverse primers. The primer sequences shown in Table 1 are the shorter variants.",

            "text": "MegB is a mismatch-tolerant molecular beacon that is also a TaqMan\u00ae probe (see Table 1). Molecular beacons (MBs) are single-stranded DNA probes that are useful for nucleic acid detection. MBs contain a fluorophore at the 5\u2032 end and a quencher at the 3\u2032 end and form a hairpin-like, stem-loop structure independently. The mismatch-tolerant of MegB is due to its long (55 nt) virus-specific sequence, which results in a high T\nm for virus-specific annealing. MegB is a modified MB with a stem-loop structure that has TaqMan\u00ae properties, i.e., it can be released by the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonuclease of the thermostable polymerase (Fig. 2A). MegB is not only complementary to the target sequence within the loop region, but it also has an additional 5\u2032 stem of 10 self-complementary nucleotides. Taq polymerase can degrade MegB and cleave the dual fluorescent dye-labelled MegB during PCR through its 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonuclease activity. When the MegB is on its own, the quencher is bound to the fluorophore, and does not fluoresce below the T\nm of the stem. Both the quenching of uncleaved probe at \u223c70 \u00b0C and the consumption of probe during the amplification process due to exonuclease activity are demonstrated by the reannealing curve (Fig. 2C). The loop region of MegB was designed to be 45 bases in length, with arm length sequences of 10 nucleotides and complementarity to the target of 45 + 10 = 55 nucleotides (Table 1). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues were used to increase the T\nm of the beacon hairpin (Johnson et al., 2004, Kumar et al., 1998, Mouritzen et al., 2003, Petersen et al., 2002, Ugozzoli et al., 2004, You et al., 2006).",

Three clinical samples that were positive for influenza A, B and C were titrated in 10-fold dilution steps for influenza A and C and in 2-fold dilution steps for influenza B down to complete negativity. An incomplete, stochastic, titration positivity (i.e., one to five positives per dilution step with six observations) at the last positive dilution step was observed for all three samples with 3QPCR-MegB. As expected, variation increased in the last two positive dilutions, just before the observed stochastic positivity in the last positive dilution. This result indicates that all three PCR assays have sensitivities of approximately 1\u201310 viral genomes per PCR reaction. The amplification efficiencies observed in the serial titrations of the three samples were 98, 92 and 96% for influenza A, B and C, respectively; illustrating that amplification from RNA has approximately the same efficiency as amplification from DNA in the two systems. However, it is likely that occasional mutations that compromise quantification can occur in practice. Absolute quantification can be somewhat erroneous. As stated above, we therefore prefer the term \u201cgenome equivalents\u201d. Using synthetic DNA as a standard in QPCR, the quantity of influenza RNA was shown to range from 10 to 107 influenza A, B and C genome equivalents per PCR reaction, which corresponds to around a 100-fold increase per ml of the nasopharyngeal specimens.

            "text": "The great variability of orthomyxoviruses is a problem for sequence-based nucleic acid detection methods. Broadly targeted methods that utilize the most conserved portions of the virus genome are needed. NP and matrix genes are conserved within, but not between, influenza types. A widely used, broadly targeted system for influenza A detection uses the matrix protein gene (Fouchier et al., 2000, Kuiken et al., 2003, Whiley and Sloots, 2005). However, the high variability of influenza, which includes the frequent emergence of radically new variants such as the avian and swine influenzas, makes it important to have alternative broadly targeted PCR assays. As shown here, the NP gene is also relatively conserved, somewhat more so than the matrix gene for influenza B and C. In an analysis of conservation of influenza A genes (Obenauer et al., 2006), the nucleoprotein gene was among the more conserved genes; it had 1.81\u20131.85 variants per nucleotide position. The relative conservation of NP makes it a good choice for PCRs that cover a wide range of targets. In addition, influenza types A, B and C are based on the antigenicity of the NP gene, and it is, therefore, logical to detect and simultaneously type the three influenza types using NP as a target. The NP gene forms a complex with the polymerase subunits, which is necessary for RNA replication, and is probably conserved for similar reasons as the polymerase subunits. NP has been previously used for conventional PCR (Shu et al., 1993). However, our 3QPCR-MegB technique is unique in that it was optimised from a large sequence base of human and animal viruses in order to facilitate broad detection. In addition, its primers and probes were optimised to allow for simultaneous detection of a broad range of the three influenza types. A disadvantage of the high sequence conservation is that the NP amplimers are of limited use for molecular epidemiology. If further characterisation is needed, hemagglutinin PCR assays should be performed (Lu et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Target sequence variability is a significant problem for probe-based detection of orthomyxoviruses, but also of caliciviruses, retroviruses and flaviviruses. The increased fault tolerance of the MegB strategy has the potential to improve detection of variable viruses in general and to enable detection of entire virus families, such as Coronaviridae (Muradrasoli et al., in preparation). The basis of the MegB strategy is to extend the length of the probe to increase its T\nm and to disperse hybridisation over a longer nucleotide stretch, encompassing variation in the entire region. As long as there are sufficient perfectly matching sequence regions, the probe will bind. This concept differs from the T\nm-increasing LNA or Minor Groove Binding (MGB) oligonucleotide modifications, which increase the T\nm of short probes that target conserved stretches, but remain sensitive to mismatches within those stretches. MegB differs from a traditional MB in that it also functions as a nuclease-degradable probe, like TaqMan\u00ae probes. This quality allows for a gradual accumulation of free fluorophore during amplification, thus enhancing the fluorescence signal. The signal from open MegB probes, which were bound to amplimers, but not degraded by the 5\u2032 exonuclease activity of the polymerase, will be added to the total signal from the MegB probes. To ensure degradability of the 5\u2032 end of MegB, the 5\u2032 end should bind to a perfectly matching target sequence. We have placed LNA in this MegB region, which also ensures hybridisation of the 5\u2032 end to its complementary 3\u2032 end at temperatures below the hairpin T\nm when MegB is not bound to amplimer. Thus, MegB is a hybrid between a MB and a TaqMan\u00ae. MegB probes can be much longer than traditional TaqMan\u00ae probes because the former do not rely on an intact oligonucleotide chain for FRET. Instead, FRET is delivered by the proximity of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends in the hairpin. Judging from theoretical predictions and from the model experiments shown here, the influenza A MegB probe should be able to detect most influenza A strains with an upper limit of 10 evenly spaced mismatches. An alternative design could be a partially double-stranded probe in which the quencher is situated on the strand opposite to the reporter (Huang et al., 2007).",

The proper role of LNA in diagnostic oligonucleotide design needs to be further defined. In our case, the introduction of LNA in theMegB influenza A and the influenza C probes allowed for the shortening of the probe in spite of maintaining a relatively high T\nm. Normally, TaqMan\u00ae probes are around 30 nucleotides long. The use of LNA allowed us to focus the probe on a shorter (A: 25 nt; InflAprobe, see Supplementary Material, C: 22 nt), highly conserved NP region than for InflBprobe (which was 31 nt long), avoiding the more variable flanks. It is reasonable to assume that introduction of LNA nucleotide(s) surrounding a mismatch site could increase fault tolerance and allow for shortening of the TaqMan\u00ae probe, which is desirable for good-quality quenching, i.e., a close distance between the fluorophores. The influenza B probe was antisense to avoid 5\u2032 G quenching. These versions gave a higher signal than the sense version of the same target sequence. As demonstrated here, the probes showed a remarkable tolerance to mismatches. The MegB influenza A probe was tested with and without LNA in the stem. These three LNA residues were necessary to generate a good signal. We cannot presently distinguish between possible better quenching of the LNA-containing version, higher 5\u2032 degradability, or better binding to the amplimer as causes of this effect.",

However, in the case of the highly variable influenza A, this fault tolerance did not prove to be enough. As discussed above, the influenza A MegB probe tolerated up to 10 mismatches, i.e., the entire recorded variation in the probe region. Evidently, the longer MegB length invited more possible mismatches than the shorter TaqMan\u00ae probes. However, it is unlikely that all possible mismatches would occur simultaneously in a wild-type virus. Therefore, the long MegB probe is more suitable to tolerate unanticipated variation than the shorter TaqMan\u00ae probes. More systematic tests of probe designs with LNA and the MegB principle are needed in order to encompass an even higher number of mismatches.",

The correlation between nested PCR and 3QPCR-MegB (and 3QPCR) results was high. All samples found to be positive by nested RT-PCR were positive by the 3QPCR assay.

However, it is not possible to claim detection of all influenza viruses. Virus variability may give rise to occasional false negative results. However, our evaluation indicated that this system can tolerate a few mismatches in both probe and primer target sequences. Further development of 3QPCR was performed due to a few false negative results for influenza A. The 3QPCR-MegB assay could detect two IFA influenza A-positive samples, which 3QPCR missed, and the 3QPCR-MegB-positive influenza A sample was missed by both IFA and 3QPCR. We conclude that both nested RT-PCR and 3QPCR-MegB were suitable for detection of influenza viruses A and B, but that 3QPCR-MegB has several advantages over nested RT-PCR; including ease of set-up and interpretation, increased sensitivity of genome detection, reduction in potential PCR contamination and discrimination of influenza types in the same assay and a degree of quantification inherent to the method. PCR is an important tool in the diagnosis of influenza infections. Rapid, diagnostic, antigen-based methods are the first line of tests used for clinical management. However, because these tests have limited sensitivity, there must be a second line of detection with more sensitive techniques, such as 3QPCR-MegB. The quantitative dimension added by 3QPCR-MegB may be important in treatment and transmissibility studies and makes 3QPCR-MegB a valuable research tool.
