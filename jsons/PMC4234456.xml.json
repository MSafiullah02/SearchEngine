The expected lag between first record and public report decreased over time in several countries. China\u2019s expected reporting lag decreased from 13.3 days in 2003 to 5.7 days in 2009, possibly a result of scrutiny in the aftermath of SARS5 (Fig. 3) and the initiated implementation of IHR. An increase in press freedom and Internet usage in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was associated with a drop in the expected reporting lag to 12.0 days in 2007. However, the expected lag rose to 17.6 days the following year, perhaps due to a government transition in which a new constitution was adopted and a single party no longer controlled the media18 (Fig. 3).",
