At the gGAPDH locus, T. teixeirae sp. n. was closest to T. minasense and T. rangeli and exhibited 14% and 15% genetic distance from these two species respectively. T. minasense has been found in neotropical non-human primates from South America (Ziccardi and Lourenco-de-Oliveira, 1999) whilst T. rangeli has been reported in a range of mammalian hosts including Brazilian bats (Maia da Silva et al., 2009). Although T. teixeirae sp. n. exhibited a relatively low (1%) genetic distance from its closest related species at the 18S rRNA locus, a similar pattern was observed when comparing other previously described species among each other. For instance, genetic distances between T. minasense and T. vespertilionis were 1% and 12% at the 18S rRNA and gGAPDH loci respectively. Trypanosomes have few morphological features detectable using light microscopy which can adequately delimit species (Gibson, 2009). Previous studies have reported that a genetic distance of 3.75% at the GAPDH gene is sufficient to delimit a new trypanosome species (McInnes et al., 2011). By this criterion, T. teixeirae sp. n. is clearly a separate species.",
