            "text": "The accuracy of the signs and tests that clinicians use to diagnose ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and initiate antibiotic treatment has not been well characterized. We sought to characterize and compare the accuracy of physical examination, chest radiography, endotracheal aspirate (ETA), bronchoscopic sampling cultures (protected specimen brush [PSB] and bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]), and CPIS > 6 to diagnose VAP. We searched six databases from inception through September 2019 and selected English-language studies investigating accuracy of any of the above tests for VAP diagnosis. Reference standard was histopathological analysis. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We included 25 studies (1639 patients). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of physical examination findings for VAP were poor: fever (66.4% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.7-85.0], 53.9% [95% CI 34.5-72.2]) and purulent secretions (77.0% [95% CI 64.7-85.9], 39.0% [95% CI 25.8-54.0]). Any infiltrate on chest radiography had a sensitivity of 88.9% (95% CI 73.9-95.8) and specificity of 26.1% (95% CI 15.1-41.4). ETA had a sensitivity of 75.7% (95% CI 51.5-90.1) and specificity of 67.9% (95% CI 40.5-86.8). Among bronchoscopic sampling methods, PSB had a sensitivity of 61.4% [95% CI 43.7-76.5] and specificity of 76.5% [95% CI 64.2-85.6]; while BAL had a sensitivity of 71.1% [95% CI 49.9-85.9] and specificity of 79.6% [95% ]. CPIS > 6 had a sensitivity of 73.8% (95% CI 50.6-88.5) and specificity of 66.4% (95% CI 43.9-83.3). Classic clinical indicators had poor accuracy for diagnosis of VAP. Reliance upon these indicators in isolation may result in misdiagnosis and potentially unnecessary antimicrobial use. References 1.

However, the importance of rapid antibiotic administration must be balanced against the risks of unnecessary antibiotics, including antibiotic resistance and superinfections [11] , particularly in the ICU [12] . Finding the right balance is challenging because VAP is difficult to diagnose. As there is no practical reference standard for VAP, perceived VAP rates and outcomes vary widely depending on the definition applied [13] , and up to two-thirds of patients treated for VAP may not actually have VAP [14, 15] . Improved methods to diagnose VAP and inform the initiation of empiric antibiotics are urgently needed.",

However, despite widespread use of these signs and tests, their accuracy to diagnose VAP is poorly characterized [1, 17] .

The withinstudy variation is described using a binomial distribution for the number of positive tests as a function of patients' true mortality status, while the between-study variation allows both the \"positivity\" and \"accuracy\" parameters to vary between studies. We obtained summary point estimates of the pairs of sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as diagnostic odds ratios and likelihood ratios, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Summary estimates of test accuracy were plotted in the ROC space together with the summary ROC curve. We conducted all analyses using the MetaDAS (version 1.3) [27] macro in SAS (SAS Institute), as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Diagnostic Test Accuracy [20] . Univariate tests for heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity are not recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy, as they did not account for heterogeneity explained by phenomena referred to as the \"positive threshold effects\" [20] . Instead, it is preferable to demonstrate heterogeneity graphically through the scatterplot and the confidence region of the bivariate summary point within the ROC plane and the descriptive forest plots.

When evaluating these signs against the reference standard of lung histopathology, we found that none were very accurate. The presence of infiltrate on plain chest radiography had the highest sensitivity (88.9%); however, all signs had poor specificity. Results were similar when using BAL as the reference standard: purulent secretions and infiltrate on chest radiography had modest sensitivity (87.9% and 85.2%), but all signs had poor specificity. CPIS was inaccurate, regardless of the reference standard used. Our study suggests that the individual signs and tests clinicians routinely use to diagnose VAP and inform initiation of antibiotics in the ICU are neither sensitive nor specific. Some clinicians perceive that BAL overcomes the limited accuracy of clinical signs, but our results suggest that quantitative BAL cultures are also subject to high rates of both false positives and false negatives [49] . Several studies have used BAL as a reference standard in the evaluation of other VAP diagnostic tools, such as biomarkers [42, 55] . The limited accuracy of BAL to diagnose VAP should be considered when interpreting these studies. The more reliable reference standard for VAP diagnosis is histopathology from lung biopsy [39] , but this is impractical for routine diagnosis, may be influenced by the area of the lung that is biopsied, and is itself subject to disagreement between pathologists [1, 56]. The accuracy of various clinical signs has been evaluated in two previous systematic reviews [1, 17] ; however, metaanalysis, summarizing pooled sensitivity and specificity, was not performed. As such, this study provides novel data highlighting the poor accuracy of the signs and tests commonly used to diagnose VAP in mechanically ventilated patients.",

Conversely, none of the evaluated clinical indicators had sufficient specificity to rule in a diagnosis of VAP. Bayesian analysis demonstrates that the individual signs we evaluated do little to alter provider pre-test probability (Supplemental Tables 14-15 ). For example, in a patient with a 50% pre-test probability of VAP, absence of infiltrate on chest x-ray only reduces the post-test probability to 30%, while presence of infiltrate only increases it to 55%.

Suspected respiratory infections, including VAP, are the biggest drivers of antimicrobial use in the ICU [57] . Qualitative analyses, however, suggest much of this utilization is unnecessary [7]. Our results indicate that clinicians should not initiate antibiotics solely on the basis of these independent signs. We suggest instead tailoring the urgency of antibiotics to severity of illness. In patients with suspected VAP and hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia, antibiotics should be started expeditiously regardless of clinical certainty. If patients are more stable, however, then more conservative approaches should be considered. Computed tomography, if available, may improve accuracy compared to plain chest radiography although this has not been sufficiently studied [58, 59] . Clinicians might also consider treating alternative causes of respiratory instability (e.g., diuresis, suctioning of mucous plugs) before starting antimicrobials in hemodynamically stable patients that can tolerate some delay in antibiotic initiation [60] [61] [62] . This approach has the potential to reduce antimicrobial utilization but requires further investigation to confirm safety. Notably, many RCTs have used VAP rates as primary outcomes [63] . Our study suggests this is an unreliable outcome. More concrete outcomes such as mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and antimicrobial utilization may be more appropriate outcomes in such trials [63] .",

            "text": "The difficulties inherent to VAP diagnosis informed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) decision to move from VAP surveillance to ventilatorassociated event (VAE) surveillance for the purposes of internal benchmarking and quality improvement [64] . This approach follows from the recognition that accurately diagnosing VAP using clinical signs is incredibly challenging, a sentiment that is supported by the results of this review. Instead, VAE surveillance focuses on detecting nosocomial deterioration in respiratory function from any cause, since this can be objectively defined through examining the trajectory of patients' ventilator settings. This approach emphasizes the importance of preventing both infectious and non-infectious complications of mechanical ventilation. However, the VAE definitions are designed to inform surveillance, not real-time clinical care. This review was performed using a comprehensive search with clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, examining various clinical indicators for VAP as compared to two different reference standards, and included unpublished data provided by study authors. We assessed risk of bias for individual studies and used GRADE methodology to assess and contextualize our findings based on our overall certainty in effect estimates. This review also has limitations. First, we evaluated clinical signs independently. In practice, providers typically use combinations of signs and tests to arrive at a diagnosis. Unfortunately, not all combinations were amenable to meta-analysis, though we did evaluate the accuracy of CPIS and summarize some combinations of signs evaluated in individual studies. Second, since we performed a meta-analysis using the published literature, there was a lack of available details on the included patients, which precluded our ability to perform subgroup analyses to further identify sources of heterogeneity. In particular, the accuracy of clinical indicators may be influenced by prior exposure to antibiotics. Unfortunately, the included studies did not always indicate whether patients had been treated with antimicrobials prior to sampling, thus precluding a sensitivity analysis restricted to patients without prior exposure to antimicrobials. Third, our pooled estimates were mostly of low certainty, due to imprecision and inconsistency. This suggests the need for high-quality studies addressing this important topic. Fourth, there is likely clinical heterogeneity across studies, particularly with relation to subjective indicators, such as purulent sputum and chest radiography, which may vary between raters. Fifth, not all tests evaluated by histopathology as reference standard were also amenable to testing by BAL as reference standard. Finally, our study may suffer from spectrum bias. In particular, the reference standard of histopathology was largely applied to deceased patients and therefore may reflect test performance in patients with more severe disease. Our findings were consistent, however, when using quantitative BAL cultures as the reference standard.",
