Hence these patients need to be triaged and isolated in the emergency room as was done at our centre Antigen testing for COVID-19 is for patients with active infection but currently reported false negative rate of between 10 and 30%. However, testing is currently restricted to patients who require hospital admission. Hence, it is pertinent to collect a throat swab of all patients for a RT_ PCR COVID 19 test. The turnaround time for RT PCR is between 6-24 hours, and this time lag can be a challenge in an emergency situation .Ai and colleagues1 report on 1014 patients who received both RT-PCR and CT in Wuhan, China, during their epidemic. They found that 97% of cases with RT-PCRconfirmed diagnoses had CT findings of pneumonia, and conclude, \"CT imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19\" (8,10). Hence a pre-hospitalisation screening may be able to detect a silent case in the incipient phase.",

Healthcare workers should strictly follow the procedures for putting on and taking off personal protective gear, and it is forbidden to wear PPEs when one leaves the contaminated area.

In particular, medical staff in operating theatre should avoid exposure to aerosols generated while using electrosurgical equipment. There are many examples that viruses do survive in surgical smoke created by electrosurgical instruments (12) . Though it is not proven that coronavirus can be transmitted via surgical smoke, it may be worthwhile to take precaution until we have evidence it does not. To reduce the hazards, surgical smoke should be minimised by suction device, and electrosurgical equipment should be used at the lowest effective power. Hence every attempt was made to minimise the surgical time.",

In cases where sutures or staples are preferred, the patients can be sent home with a suture or staple removal kit with written instructions and links for how to do it themselves. Successful removal can be confirmed via a telehealth visit (23) (24) (25) (26) . In our series of patients we followed a hospital protocol of telehealth and telerehabilitation during their convalescence .",

Those that needed inpatient care for emergency and urgent surgeries were admitted after obtaining a COVID Throat swab and an Emergency High Resolution CT Scan at the time of admission. All Emergency patients were taken up for immediate surgery. All Urgent patients were shifted to a dedicated Isolation floor in the hospital equipped with individual isolation patient suites. The medical personnel on the Isolation floor donned a full Hazmat suit PPE with Leggings and disposable double surgical gloves. The Surgical Suites of our institute are situated on two adjoining floors of the hospital and are designed to be diametrically symmetrical with negative pressure operating rooms. As per protocol they have been segregated into Non COVID and COVID Complexes. COVID positive patients or those with clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID who need to be operated on an emergency basis were directed to undergo surgeries in a Dedicated COVID Operating room in the COVID complex located at a satellite unit created and refurbished for the purpose.The Non COVID complex has six operating rooms of which only three were allowed to function at any given point in time Alterations were made to the existing plan of the operating room in order to accommodate a Donning in area, a safe sterile passage and a doffing area for all medical personnel.(Figure 5)",

Use of absorbable suture materials where possible. Consider using self-locking sutures like stratafix ( J&J) 13. Patient should be monitored for 30 minutes after the end of procedure in the same operating room.",

The average length of stay was 2.5 days in Patients with no Co Morbidities was 2.5 days and that in the Co Morbidities group was 7.8 days. There was one unfavorable result in the form of post-operative death on the third post-operative day due to a sudden onset cardiac event. This past had a prior history of myocardial event and had undergone a Coronary by-pass 7 years back. On 2 nd post-operative surgery he had a sudden cardiac arrest, a code blue was activated but he could not be revived. One patient ( P5 ) with pyogenic spondylodiscitis and multiple co-morbidities DM, HT, pyelonephritis, septicemia and E coli Infection, hypoalbuminemia and urinary tract infection with Candida albicans who was operated 30 days ago for cauda equina syndrome is still admitted and had to be transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure and bilateral transudative pleural effusion and ARDS changes. She has a wound VAC for delayed healing and discharge. The rest of the patients had an uneventful post-operative period till discharge. A wound inspection was performed only if there was a visible soakage from the dressings. All patients were instructed to follow up at approximately 2 weeks after surgery. Patients and their care givers were instructed about rehabilitation protocols in the immediate post-operative period and were asked to follow up via video conferencing and tele-consultation in the period of convalescence by the primary surgeon along with the rehabilitation team. orthopaedic surgery and in other specialties, are yet to come up with their own specific guidelines in this rapidly changing environment. Fortunately governments have stepped up to the occasion and are in process of providing either recommendations or mandates regarding the performance of semi elective and elective procedures. (5)This topic of returning to normalcy in terms of being able to operate on semi elective and elective cases is particularly relevant for orthopaedic surgeons as majority of orthopaedic revenues come from elective procedures(6). However, one source of information that states, hospitals, and surgeons can consult is the CMS tiered approach for surgical services 2. Tiers 1, 2, and 3 designate low, intermediate, and high-acuity procedures, respectively, whereas the designations \"a\" and \"b\" indicate healthy and unhealthy patients. CMS recommends postponing all Tier-1 operations, to consider postponing Tier-2 operations, and to continue performing Tier-3 operations. Specific orthopaedic operations that are mentioned include carpal tunnel releases (Tier 1a), \"hip, knee replacement and elective spine surgery\" (Tier 2a), and \"most cancers\" and \"highly symptomatic patients\" (Tier 3a)(7). Based on these recommendations and guidelines from the Indian Orthopaedic Association it was decided to perform only emergency and urgent surgeries which included , open fractures, cauda equina syndrome, acute epidural abscesses in the emergency category and fracture neck femurs and displaced periarticular fractures which necessitated and early surgical intervention .",
