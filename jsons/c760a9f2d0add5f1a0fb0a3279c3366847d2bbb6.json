            "text": "We also prepared a U JSi copolymer, USi (543/ 521), with total monomer to initiator ratio, M/I, of 1064. The resulting polymer had a quite broad molecular weight distribution (Fig. 3 ) ; its polydispersity index was 1.93. When its peak position is compared with that of USi(59/57), which has nearly the same composition, this polymer has an estimated degree of polymerization of only 374, much lower than the M / I ratio (1064). The reason for the low molecular weight and broad molecular weight distribution is that chain transfer to monomer occurs at high M / I ratio^.'^,'^ As we can see from Figure 1 , all GPC traces have a small peak at twice the molecular weight of the main peak. We believe that the high molecular weight polymer was generated from the coupling of two lower molecular weight polymers. The mechanism of the coupling reaction is not clear. In fact, there was almost no coupled polymer after a short polymerization time with a monomer conversion of about 80% (curve 1 in Fig. 4 ) . As the polymerization uble in most organic solvents. At low temperature, they precipitated as oils from methanol. It was difficult to remove all the ODCB by washing them with methanol. They were dried at 100-115\u00b0C under vacuum (0.1 7). They are soft and transparent gel-like solids at room temperature. Heating them at 140-150\u00b0C for 24 h under vacuum resulted in their crosslinking; they could no longer be dissolved in any solvent. While we are not certain, a possible explanation of the crosslinking could be silyloxy exchange reactions, with the loss of hexamethyldisiloxane and the formation of a -Si -0 -Sicrosslink. Monomer Si and monomers U and N are all oxazolines with long alkyl tails attached to the 2-carbon of the oxazoline ring. Si, however, has a pentamethyl disiloxanyl group at the far end of the polymethylene tail. These monomers should have the same reactivity since their structural differences are ten atoms or more away from the reactive site. The copolymerization of U with Si or N with Si should be random. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that both monomers were consumed a t the same rate during the copolymerization of U and Si (Fig. 3 ) . The ratio of the two monomer peaks on GPC traces, Asi/Au, was 1.57 after 4 h polymerization at 120-130\u00b0C, and 1.64 after 7 h. Since the concentration ratio of the two monomers was constant, the polymerization rates of the two monomers were the same, which results in random copolymers. The relative peak areas of the methyl (i, 6 = 0.85) in the undecyl group and the methylenyl (e, 6 = 0.50) or methyl (f + g, 6 = 0.07, 0.04) in the 'H-NMR spectra were used to calculate the copolymer compositions. The monomer ratios calculated from the NMR spectra were in reasonably good agreement with the monomer ratios given in Table I (Table 111 ).",
