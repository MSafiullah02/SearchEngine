It has been estimated that 50 million cases of DENV infections occur, and approximately 500,000 patients have been hospitalized with DHF, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions2. Evidence has suggested that because of the geographical extension of DENV infection and increases in the number of DENV cases and disease severity, DF and DHF have become major public health problems, with more than one-third of the global population residing in high-transmission-risk areas3\u20135. DHF is a complex disease, and its mechanism remains elusive. Currently, no specific treatment or effective vaccine is available for DHF4. Because prior DENV infection is a risk factor for developing DHF during secondary infections5, an abnormal immune response has been considered a vital component of the DHF pathophysiology.",

Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain this phenomenon6\u20138 For example, according to the widely accepted hypothesis of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in the initial (first) step, instead of providing protective immunity, preexisting nonneutralizing anti-DENV antibodies can form immune complexes with DENVs, substantially increasing the infectivity of DENVs targeting Fc receptor-expressing leukocytes9\u201311. It is suggested that DENV antibody-complexes boost virus production per infected cell by suppressing intracellular antiviral responses6,7,12. Accordingly, ADE of DENV secondarily leads to an increased overall virus replication in the leukocytes and a suppressed leukocyte-mediated immunity in the following (second and later) steps. Because the nonneutralizing anti-DENV antibodies are elicited before ADE, additional explanation regarding how DENV infections lead to immunosuppression in the first step that prior to ADE is required. One hypothesis, original antigenic sin, suggests that initial immunosuppression occurs before ADE13,14. However, the detailed mechanism that leads to the production of nonneutralizing antibodies and particularly the relevant B cell response remains elusive.",

            "text": "Clinical15\u201317, cellular, and animal studies18\u201326 have found that DENV infections and DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) immunizations elicit autoantibodies against plasma, platelet, and endothelial antigens. Among these autoantigens, our previous report suggest that endothelial TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 1 (death receptor 4 [DR4]; also known as TNFRSF10A) could be a potential autoantibody target leading to plasma leakage in severe DENV infections in our previous study23. DR4 is a member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family and shows certain structural similarities with the TNFR family members of TACI, BCMA, and BAFFR. If DENV also elicits cross-reactive autoantibodies targeting to TACI, BCMA, and BAFFR, the lymphocyte regulation and particularly B cell function may therefore be impaired. However, this possibility is not yet verified. As a result, in this study, we hypothesize that in DENV infections, autoantibodies may be generated against 3 receptors of B-cell activating factor (BAFF; also known as BLyS and TNFSF13B), which include B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA; also known as TNFRSF17), transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI; also known as TNFRSF13B) and BAFF receptor 3 (BAFFR; also known as TNFRSF13C). BAFF is a cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family and is mainly expressed on B lymphocytes, and BAFF expression varies depending on B cell maturation. All 3 BAFF receptors, TACI, BCMA, and BAFFR, are expressed on B cells. TACI is found on a subset of T cells, and BCMA is found on plasma cells. These receptors play critical roles in regulating B lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation, maturation, and activation27\u201329. Collectively, the involvement of TACI, BCMA, and BAFFR in autoantibody mediated pathogenesis in dengue may be worth of further investigations.",

We analyzed the anti-TACI, anti-BCMA, and anti-BAFFR Ig levels in patients infected with DENV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results revealed that patients with DHF tended to exhibit higher IgG titers against TACI compared with normal donors and patients with DF (Fig. 1A). Rabbit Igs were used to investigate whether DENV NS1 immunization elicits anti-TACI titers. Consistent with our previous study, ELISA data showed that anti-DR4 titers were elicited following immunization with recombinant NS1 (rNS1) (Fig. 1B). Notably, both the anti-NS1 Ig and a DR4 affinity-enriched fraction of the anti-NS1 Ig (anti-NS1-DR4 Ig) could still recognize TACI substrates (Fig. 1B, TACI group).",

Data indicated that anti-NS1-DR4 and anti-NS1-TACI Ig treatments induced cell death of Raji and Jurkat cells in a dose dependent manner (Suppl. Fig. 2); and treatments of rNS1 but not rGST neutralized cell-death inducing property of anti-NS1-DR4 Igs (Suppl. Fig. 3A,B). Additionally, anti-NS1-DR4 Ig fractions prepared from animals immunized with single serotype (DENV-2 NS1 alone) and heterologous serotype (DENV-2 NS1 + DENV-3 NS1), exhibited similar levels of cell-death inducting property (Suppl. Fig. 3C,D). This suggests that the experimental system is feasible, and the autoantibody production of NS1 immunized animals is not influenced by immunizations of single or heterologous serotype NS1. We found that treatments with rTACI and rDR4 considerably reduced anti-NS1-TACI and anti-NS1-DR4 Ig-induced cell death in both Raji and Jurkat cells (Fig. 2E,F, rDR4 or rTACI + Igs group). This suggests that the anti-TACI and anti-DR4 subfractions of anti-NS1 Igs are still able to induce lymphocytic cell death if the titer is high enough.",

Because DHF is considered to be associated with secondary DENV infection2, 2 immunization cycles of these proteins, particularly NS1, were performed. We found that anti-GST, anti-NS1, anti-TACI, and anti-DR4 Ig titers were markedly elicited in the experimental mice after 2 immunization cycles (Suppl. Fig. 4). Following previously described methods32, we found that splenic CD3+CD4\u2212CD8\u2212, CD3+CD4+CD8\u2212, and CD3+CD4\u2212CD8+ T cell populations were not affected after 2 immunization cycles of rGST, rNS1, rTACI, and rDR4 (Suppl. Fig. 5). We analyzed the B cell markers IgM and IgD to detect mature (IgD+IgM\u2212) and transitional (T1: IgD\u2212IgM+ and T2: IgD+IgM+) B cells and the markers CD21/CD35 and CD23 to identify follicular (CD23+CD21/CD35int) and marginal zone B cells (CD23\u2212CD21/CD35hi). We also analyzed splenic B cells according to previous reported methods33,34. Similar to the results of T cell analysis, considerable changes were not observed in some splenic B cell populations, including follicular (Fo: CD23+CD21/CD35int) and marginal zone (MZ: CD23\u2212CD21/CD35hi) B cells (Suppl. Fig. 6), in the mice after immunization with the recombinant proteins. However, at an earlier developmental stage (Suppl. Fig. 7), considerable changes were observed in transitional (T1: IgD\u2212IgM+ and T2: IgD+IgM+) B cells after immunization with rNS1 and rDR4 (Fig. 3, GST vs. NS1 and DR4 groups). Although not obvious, the TACI group tended to exhibit similar changes (Fig. 3). Because the T1 populations were increased and the T2 populations were suppressed (Fig. 3, NS1 and DR4 groups), and according to the B cell differentiation process (Suppl. Fig. 7), anti-NS1 and anti-DR4 antibodies may block the transition from T1 to T2 cells. This explanation is consistent with findings of previous studies indicating that primary B cells express TRAIL receptors35\u201337, and transitional T2, but not T1, B cells express TACI38,39.",

Although the total circulating IgM and IgG levels were not changed (Suppl. Fig. 8), whether such B cell abnormalities are sufficient to result in suppressed humoral immunity remains unclear. Thus, we performed functional analysis to investigate whether such B cell abnormalities lead to immunosuppression. DENV envelope protein domain III (EIII) contains glycosaminoglycan property; by which DENV utilizes EIII to bind to cell surface receptors and enter target cells44\u201346. Thus, anti-DENV EIII neutralizing antibodies have a protective effect against DENV infection47,48. Following the experimental methods in the previous section, we first immunized mice with recombinant proteins, rGST, rNS1, rTACI, and rDR4, for 2 immunization cycles and then immunized all groups of mice with recombinant EIII (rEIII) for 2 additional cycles (Fig. 6A, experimental outline). We hypothesized that if anti-NS1 and anti-DR4 Ig-induced B lymphocyte defects are sufficient to result in suppressed humoral immunity, we would observe a lower anti-EIII antibody titer. Consistent with our hypothesis, a relatively lower anti-EIII Ig titer was elicited in mice preimmunized with rNS1 and rDR4 (Fig. 6B, *P < 0.05, vs. adjuvant and GST groups). To analyze whether such anti-EIII Igs also display different protective properties against DENV infection, we used anti-EIII Igs from different mouse groups to protect BHK-21 cells from DENV infection in vitro. Notably, the anti-EIII sera from adjuvant, rGST, and rTACI-preimmunized mice displayed considerable protective effects against DENV infection compared with the untreated control groups (Fig. 6C, adjuvant, GST, and TACI groups, *P < 0.05). However, the anti-EIII sera from rNS1 and rDR4-preimmunized mice did not display significant protective effect (Fig. 6C, NS1 and DR4 groups). The coefficient of determination (R-squared; R2) analysis revealed that the anti-EIII IgG levels are indeed positively correlated with protected cell viability of DENV-infected cells (Suppl. Fig. 9). These results collectively suggest that the elicitation of DR4 cross-reactive Igs causes the abnormal development of bone marrow B cells and results in suppressed humoral immunity in mice.",

It is unclear how these nonneutralizing Igs are elicited before the ADE phenomenon. Recent findings suggest that even the neutralizing Igs at a dose below the neutralizing concentration exhibit the enhancing properties48,50. Anti-DENV EIII monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from immortalized memory B cells of patients after primary or secondary infections were either serotype specific or cross-reactive and potently neutralized DENV infection48. However, a notable finding is that all these mAbs enhanced infection at subneutralizing concentrations48. This evidence suggests that even if the Ig concentration is not sufficiently high, the neutralizing antibodies produced by B cells may still induce the pathogenic ADE effect. In this study, we found that the preexisting anti-NS1 and anti-DR4 Igs could suppress the neutralizing antibody titers in the mice subsequently immunized with DENV EIII (Fig. 6). This finding provides a possible explanation for the production of such nonneutralizing or subneutralizing antibodies before ADE.",

            "text": "Another puzzling aspect of humoral immunity suppression after DENV infection is the delayed induction of anti-DENV Igs during secondary DENV infection51. One valuable observation from DENV-endemic regions is that the prevalence of the anti-DENV antibody in the general population can reach up to 90%51\u201353. This observation suggests that the majority of the population in endemic regions has already been infected with DENV at least once. In cases of infection with ordinary pathogens, a rapid anamnestic antibody response should occur within 1\u20133 days after the same antigens are reencountered51,54. However, the anti-DENV Igs display late induction that peaks at 6\u201310 days after fever onset during secondary infection in DHF patients10,51. The relevant mechanism is unclear. According to the original antigenic sin hypothesis, a weak immune response occurs during secondary DENV infections13,14. However, the mechanism on the elicitation of insufficient humoral immunity in dengue remains elusive. In this study, we found that preexisting anti-NS1 and anti-DR4 antibody fractions could suppress B cell development (Figs. 3\u20135) and the subsequently elicited neutralizing antibodies against DENV (Fig. 6). In addition, our results revealed that the anti-DR4 Ig affects immature B cell precursors (Figs. 3 and 5). The suppression of newly produced B cells in the secondary DENV-infected hosts may result in preferred antibody production from those mature B cell clones been developed during the primary infections. Thus, compare to the original antigenic sin hypothesis, the suppressive effect of DENV-elicited anti-death receptor Igs on the antibody production by B cells is an alternative explanation for the phenotype in biased and suppressed humoral immunity, as well as the delayed and weak induction of anti-DENV antibodies during secondary infection (Suppl. Fig. 10).",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated that DENV NS1 can elicit anti-death receptor Ig fractions. We also demonstrated that the elicitation of the anti-DR4 fraction is associated with abnormal populations of bone marrow and splenic B cell precursors and suppressed humoral immunity. Our data revealed that, although the elicitation of anti-TACI Ig was not statistically significant compared with the elicitation of anti-DR4 Ig fractions, anti-TACI Igs still tended to exert a suppressive effect under certain conditions (e.g., in Figs. 2, 5, and 6B). Through interaction with TACI, BCMA, and BAFFR on B cells, BAFF enhances B cell differentiation and activation38,55. BAFF overexpression is associated with autoantibody production in autoimmune diseases56. BAFF promotes autoantibody production through TACI-dependent activation of transitional B cells57. TACI plays a critical role in the regulation of B cell differentiation and activation38,58,59. TACI\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited accumulation and activation of B cells60, and TACI deficiency leads to an autoimmune-prone phenotype59. By contrast, TACI-Fc leads to decreased B cell numbers and potently blocks humoral immune responses61\u201363. Furthermore, the induction of TACI expression levels enhances B cell apoptosis in vivo64. Similar to TACI deficiencies, deficiencies in TRAIL receptors lead to an inflammation-prone phenotype65,66. TRAIL\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to arthritis and diabetes67. Moreover, recombinant TRAIL was demonstrated to inhibit autoimmune diseases in numerous animal models, such as those of rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and autoimmune thyroiditis68,69. TRAIL sensitizes B cells to apoptosis and induces B cell apoptosis35\u201337. By cross-linking with the cell surface receptors, anti-DR4 Igs induce similar signaling to that of the native ligand TRAIL70\u201372. These findings collectively suggest that the both TACI and DR4 pathways play negative roles in the regulation of immune homeostasis and may explain why the elicitation of anti-NS1 and anti-DR4 Igs suppressed humeral immunity in vivo. Because NS1 immunization elicited both anti-DR4 and anti-TACI Ig fractions in this study (Fig. 2B), a synergy between these 2 antibody fractions may be theoretically possible and worth further investigation.",

For example, antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral uptake by FcR-bearing cells and productive infection9\u201311, anti-platelet and anti-endothelial cell autoantibodies associated thrombocytopenia and vascular leakage15\u201317,19\u201326. To summarize and integrate the results described in this report with these previous findings, we postulate a hypothetical model following the time line of DHF pathogenesis (Suppl. Fig. 11). Based on the 2-hit model, the levels of anti-platelet and anti-endothelial cell autoantibody fractions (second-hit) are not sufficient to elicit hemorrhage pathogenesis, only when the DENV-induced defects (first-hit) are co-occurring22. Accordingly, elevated levels of autoantibodies suppress the B cell development, could thereby reduce the anti-DENV-neutralizing Ig production, and lead to stronger DENV (first hit)-induced damages and thus result in an increased risk on the development of DHF (Suppl. Fig. 11). Because the anti-DENV Igs are cross-reactive, virus-Ig complexes subsequently induce antibody dependent enhancement (ADE)-related pathogenesis to further exacerbate the disease (Suppl. Fig. 10).",

Recombinant DENV envelope protein domain III (EIII) was purchased from ProSpec (East Brunswick, NJ). Recombinant TACI ectodomain (rTACI) was expressed by Escherichia coli. Preimmune Ig and anti-NS1 Ig from New Zealand white rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were obtained before and after immunizations of NS1 recombinant proteins24,30. The anti-DR4 Ig was prepared from recombinant DR4-immunized rabbits as described23. The anti-TACI Ig was prepared from rTACI-immunized rabbits. All serum samples of protein immunized rabbits were collected 7\u201310 days after the 5th immunization cycle of aforementioned recombinant proteins. To enhance the immunization efficiency in rabbit and mouse experiments, the recombinant proteins (250 \u03bcg/rabbit; 50 \u03bcg/mouse) were emulsified with complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in the first immunization; in the later boosting cycles, incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) was used 1:1 (v/v) mixed with recombinant proteins, 100 \u03bcg/rabbit; 25 \u03bcg/mouse) as described30,73,74. The induction of IgG titers against specific antigens was confirmed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A batch of 8 rabbits was immunized with NS1, in which anti-sera from 3 rabbits with relatively higher anti-DR4 and anti-TACI IgG titers were used.

As described23, anti-NS1-DR4 and anti-NS1-TACI Igs were further prepared from protein A-fractions of anti-NS1 Ig through affinity purifications using rDR4- and rTACI-conjugated beads, respectively. Using SDS-PAGE and NIH-Image J software (version 1.6.2), the purified Igs were estimated approximately 87%\u201391% pure. Experimental mice and rabbits were maintained at a specific pathogen free condition with consistent temperature and humidity controls, and 12 h light/dark cycles75\u201377.

The cell viability of these 2 cell lines was analyzed using a WST-1 kit (Roche Life Science, Penzberg, Germany)30,82,83. The tetrazolium salt WST-1 is cleaved to a soluble formazan by the succinate-tetrazolium reductase system, which is only active in metabolically intact cells, and the formazan is measurable at 450 nm using an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA)84. The surviving Jurkat and Raji cells were measured after treatments with varying antibodies (100 \u03bcg/mL) for 72 h. The 72 h groups of Ig treated cells were also applied to caspase-3 analysis, which were conducted using caspase-activity assay kits purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Baby hamster kidney BHK-21 cells (ATCC\u00ae CCL-10)85 were maintained in DMEM 10% FBS, 4.5 g/L glucose, 6 mM glutamine cell culture medium and were used in the analysis of anti-envelop EIII protein neutralizing antibody. The serum samples from mice immunized with 2 cycles of recombinant GST, NS1, TACI and DR4, and 2 additional cycles with recombinant DENV EIII were collected and placed in a 56 \u00b0C water bath for 20 m to inactivate the complement. The BHK-21 cells were cultured in 96 well dishes in serum free medium, with aforementioned antisera supplements (20 \u00b5L/well of microtiter plate). The cell survival was then analyzed after challenged with or without DENV (MOI = 0.5) for 96 h using a WST-1 kit (Roche). The mosquito (Aedes albopictus) cell line C6/36 (ATCC\u00ae CRL1660\u2122) was maintained using EMEM (EBSS) 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine at 28 \u00b0C, and was used for identification of DENV in patient serum samples.",

All animals were housed in the Tzu-Chi University Animal Center in a specific-pathogen-free, temperature and lighting controlled environment with free access to filtered water and food. The experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Tzu-Chi University (approval ID: 101019). Fluorescence-labeled anti-IgM, anti-IgD, anti-B220, anti-CD43, anti-CD21/CD35 and anti-CD23 Igs that used in the flow cytometry B lymphocyte analyses, were purchased from (eBioscience, San Diego, CA and BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Anti-IgM and anti-IgD were used to identify subsets as described. Anti-CD21/CD35 and anti-CD23 Igs were used to identify spleen B cell subsets following previously described methods. Following previously described methods33,34,40\u201343, we analyze spleen transitional T1, T2, and follicular and marginal zone, mature B cells, bone marrow mature (IgD+IgM-, IgD+IgM+) and immature (IgD-IgM+) B cells, and pre-pro-B (CD43+B220+), pre-B and pro-B (CD43-B220+) cells. A flow cytometer (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was used in this study as described86\u201388. C57BL/6J mice were immunized with rGST, rNS1, rDR4 and rTACI for 2 immunization cycles (50 \u00b5g immunogen/mouse/immunization cycle) in 1 wk intervals and then the bone marrow and spleen lymphocytes were analyzed 7 d later using aforementioned B cell markers. To analyze the potential suppressive effect of prior immunizations of NS1 on later induction of neutralizing antibody, C57BL/6J mice were first immunized with rGST, rNS1, rDR4 and rTACI by 2 immunization cycles (50 \u00b5g immunogen/mouse/immunization cycle) and then immunized with 2 additional immunization cycles of DENV rEIII in 1 wk intervals. The anti-EIII titer and the DENV-neutralizing property of these polyclonal antibody fractions were then analyzed.",
