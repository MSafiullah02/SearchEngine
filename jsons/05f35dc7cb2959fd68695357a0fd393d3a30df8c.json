Sampling of a rapidly progressing pleural effusion showed a pleural fluid pH 6.95, glucose 44 mg/dL and LDH 1842 IU/L. Gram stain of both fluids revealed clusters of gram positive cocci.

After a prolonged ICU course, he was ultimately discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility and subsequently returned to full functional status. He continues to receive intermittent outpatient IVIG. Patients in need of mechanical ventilation or vasopressor support because of septic shock automatically require intensive care. However, the decision to admit to the ICU is more difficult when such obvious needs are not present. Early identification of patients likely to deteriorate is important as increased mortality is associated with ICU transfer for delayed respiratory failure or onset of septic shock. Pooled analysis of four prospective CAP studies, of which 138 had delayed-transfer compared to 315 direct Emergency Department (ED) to ICU admissions, demonstrated that the delayed-transfer group had higher 28-day mortality (23.4 % vs. 11.7 %, p < 0.02) and hospital length of stay (13 days vs. 7 days, p < 0.001) in propensity-matched analysis [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1878, "end": 1881, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "While some delayed transfers to the ICU represent progressive pneumonia despite appropriate treatment, many patients have subtle clinical findings upon presentation that predict a more aggressive approach will lead to improved outcomes.

Over the last decade HCAP has been used to describe the entity wherein patients develop pneumonia outside the hospital yet have pathogens usually associated with HAP or VAP, such as MDR gram-negative bacilli and MRSA. Criteria for HCAP and the resultant number of patients who should get broad-spectrum empirical therapy remain subject to debate. Using any risk factor for drug-resistant pathogens (DRP) leads to antibiotic overtreatment, while ignoring risk factors is associated with undertreatment and adverse outcomes [5] . In a prospective observational study, Shindo et al. found six independent risk factors for pathogens resistant to the usual CAP antibiotics: (1) hospitalization \u2265 2 days during the previous 90 days, (2) antibiotic use during the previous 90 days, (3) non-ambulatory status, (4) tube feedings, (5) immunocompromised status, and (6) use of gastric acid suppression medications [17] . Presence of three or more risk factors should prompt a physician to consider broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, as the frequency of drug resistant pathogens may be as high as 43 %.

Presence of PVL may explain the associated neutropenia while other exotoxins, such as alpha-hemolysin, may result in the characteristic severe pulmonary hemorrhage of both the MRSA and MSSA infections [18] . Antibiotic therapy that also suppresses toxin production provides better outcomes and improved survival, as illustrated in a retrospective study of PVL-positive CAP [19] . Clindamycin and linezolid have been shown to suppress in-vitro formation of PVL, alphahemolysin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, whereas vancomycin and beta-lactams have no effect [18] . The benefit of clindamycin combined with a beta-lactam for MSSA CAP is unclear, with a recent prospective analysis demonstrating that nearly 18 % of CA-MRSA isolates were clindamycin resistant; whether antibiotic growth inhibition detected by MIC-susceptibility tests correlates with toxin-suppression activity, though, is unclear [20, 21] . While the preferred treatment for PVL-positive MSSA CAP is still unclear, linezolid appears the most reasonable choice for CA-MRSA CAP in light of its potential to suppress exotoxin and offer faster eradication of other MRSA clones.
