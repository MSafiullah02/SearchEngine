But is diabetes per se a risk factor that increases the probability of getting the virus? This paper will discuss this point. There are not many research data on antidiabetic drugs in this context. The potential influence of glucose-lowering agents on the severity of COVID-19 has not been described yet. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a cell surface protein ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and it is also a soluble molecule found in serum/plasma fluids. DPP-4 is involved in infection of cells by some viruses. This paper reviews data about the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and others diabetes drugs on COVID-19 patients. As such, no available evidence has yet suggested that glucose-lowering drugsincluding those targeting DPP4-related pathwaysproduce any significant harm or benefit in the context of human infections. However, insulin must remain the first-choice agent in the management of critically ill-hospitalized patients, while it is recommended to suspend other agents in unstable patients. This paper provides related French and international recommendations for people with diabetes who got infected by COVID-19 and upholds that infections may alter glucose control and may require additional vigilance.

Thus, in one of the first short series in Wuhan, a city heavily affected by the virus, out of 41 patients, 20% had diabetes and 15% had hypertension [1] . In another series of 140 infected and hospitalized patients, 12% were diabetic [2] . However, the lack of a control group makes this possible increase in the prevalence of infected and hospitalized diabetic patients uncertain. In addition, a lower prevalence of 3% of diabetic patients presenting symptoms for more than 10 days was also reported, but there was only a small number of patients concerned here, which has been an obstacle to correctly estimating this prevalence [3] . Thus, in a meta-analysis of 12 studies in China, out of 2018 confirmed infected patients, the prevalence of diabetes was 10.3%, which was similar to the prevalence of diabetic patients in China in 2013, meaning 10 .9% for all ages combined [4, 5] .",

The rate of diabetic patients varies, depending of the patient's location, the age and the method of testing. Similarly, it depends on the hospitalization criteria, which have changed over time, meaning that patients having one of the moderate forms of the disease have been decreasingly hospitalized, compared with the practice followed at the beginning of the pandemic.

Inflammation markers such as CRP, interleukin-6, ferritin and D-dimers are increased compared to non-diabetic patients while a marked inflammatory or cytokine storm is thought to be associated with a more pejorative prognosis [15] . In a review and meta-analysis of 15 studies including 51,845 patients with COVID-19 of whom 9,066 were severe cases, high age was independently associated with a severe form [16] . In this review, diabetes was also associated with the occurrence of a severe form with an RR of 2.81 (95% CI: 2.01-3.93), and this association persisted in a study with multivariate analysis taking into account age (RR 2.21, 95% CI: 1.33-3.66, p = 0.002) [17] . The risk of severe form was also increased by the presence of unbalanced or complicated diabetes in studies of patients with H1N1 viruses in 2009 and with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [13] [14] [15] . In a retrospective observational study from March 1st to April 6th, 2020 and despite several limitations, the mortality rate was 28.8% in patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia, compared with 6.2% in patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (p <0.001). In a cohort of 7,336 COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes from 19 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, people admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and diabetes required more medical interventions. Despite these interventions, they also had significantly higher mortality: 7.8 % versus 2.7 % as well as a greater incidence of multiple organ injury. Patients with well-controlled blood glucose (glycemic variability within 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) had a markedly lower mortality compared to individuals with poorly controlled blood glucose (upper limit of glycemic variability exceeding 10.0 mmol/L) (adjusted HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03-0.60, p = 0.008) during hospitalization [18] . These COVID-19 patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a particularly high mortality rate. A variety of immune system abnormalities has been postulated to explain the association between hyperglycemia and immune dysfunction, including impairment in polymorphonuclear and monocytic white blood cell chemotaxis and phagocytosis, complement function, and cytokine dysregulation [19] . The fact that acute hyperglycemia plays a role which can be improved through effective glycemic management remained to be proved. In another study among over 500 patients with coronavirus, hyperglycemia was often transient and generally resolved after discharge from hospital in the majority of subjects [20] . The authors suggest that clinicians should treat hyperglycemia to achieve BG targets <180 mg/dL for most patients [19] . Klonoff et al. proposed four risk factors which can increase the risk of poor outcomes: a susceptibility to hyperglycemia from corticosteroid therapy, an inadequate glucose monitoring, a lack of contact with healthcare professionals and an inappropriate discontinuation of angiotensin receptor blockers [21] . CORONADO is an ongoing French study aiming to determine the risk factors of severe forms of the disease throughout the country [22] . In China, intensive care unit (ICU) patients were more likely to have diabetes, were older (66 years vs. 51 years), and had twice as many co-morbidities (72% vs. 37%) compared to those who did not need to go to the ICU [23] . Male sex was more frequent in infected vs non-infected patients, with a described proportion ranging from 56% to 82%; men also appeared to be over-represented in ICU patients (61% vs. 52%), but this difference was not statistically significant [3, 10, 23] .",

It stimulates inflammatory immune responses by modifying the production of several cytokines and chemokines [27] [28] [29] [30] . Several studies have therefore focused on the role of DPP-4 inhibitors in the development of infections.

            "text": "Similarly, concerning other antidiabetic medications, there is no established evidence supporting any clinical benefit in COVID-19 patients but potential risks must be carefully kept in mind. Indeed, while metformin, glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, thiazolidinediones and insulin have all been associated with anti-inflammatory effects [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] which could be potentially beneficial in the context of a cytokine storm, no association was observed for insulin or other glucose-lowering therapy among survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19 [8] . However, it is suggested that the use of metformin, sodium-glucose-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, GLP-1R agonists, pioglitazone and insulin may increase the expression of ACE2 and therefore be potentially associated with a more severe condition [47] [48] [49] . In critically ill COVID-19 patients, the risk of metabolic acidosis associated with metformin might be exacerbated as well as the consequences of volume depletion with SGLT-2 inhibitors. Hence, insulin remains the drug of choice in these situations.",

It is mentioned that initial insulin resistance is frequently observed. The use of infusion pump insulin therapy is recommended to achieve glycemic targets and non-insulin treatments for type 2 diabetes should be stopped until the patient's clinical condition (renal, cardiac and respiratory function) is improved. risk of ketoacidosis in this context.

This paper upholds that, upon admission to hospital of unstable patients and critically ill patients, DPP4 inhibitors, GLP-1R agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin should be used with caution or discontinued. In general, insulin is extensively used in critically ill hospitalized diabetic patients, as well as in patients with concomitant sepsis. Therefore, insulin is the most relevant treatment in these situations, particularly for patients who are hospitalized in intensive care units where other glucose lowering drugs should be discontinued. Careful attention must be paid to avoid hyperglycemia. The lack of physical activity and diet caused by the lockdown, and infection due to COVID-19 are two situations that may worsen glycemic control. Both hospitalized and ambulatory patients with diabetes are advised to ensure a careful monitoring of blood glucose and to maintain a regular communication with their health care provider.",
