Most existing methods focus on extracting intra-sentence or explicit causality, while neglecting the causal relations that expressed implicitly or hidden in inter-sentences. In this paper, we propose Cascaded multi-Structure Neural Network (CSNN), a novel and unified model that extract intersentence or implicit causal relations from Chinese Corpus, without relying on external knowledge. The model employs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture important features as well as causal structural pattern. Self-attention mechanism is designed to mine semantic and relevant characteristics between different features. The output of CNN and self-attention structure are concatenated as higher-level phrase representations. Then Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer is employed to calculate the label of each word in inter-sentence or implicit causal relation sentences, which improves the performance of inter-sentence or implicit causality extraction. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results, improved on three datasets, when compared with other methods.",

Causal relation of text exists in many scenario, such as product or social event reviews. The causality can be formalized as the relationship between event e 1 and event e 2 , where the event e 2 is considered as a result of the event e 1 [17] . The representation of causal relations can be concluded into four forms: explicit causal relation whose sentence contains explicit causal connective such as \"lead to\", implicit causal relation whose sentence does not contain causal connective, intra-sentence causal relation whose cause-effect are distributed in short text between two adjacent punctuations, and inter-sentence causal relation whose cause-effect is broken by punctuations. Examples of the four forms are shown in Table 1 . Automatic extraction of causality from texts plays an important role in natural language processing application, such as providing event basis for question answer system [19] .

            "text": "Rule-based [9] methods or traditional machine learning methods [1] contribute a lot on causality mining. However, there are still many drawbacks. More specifically, rule-based methods heavily depend on manually designed language patterns, such as lexical-syntactic patterns [11] . Recently, deep learning methods are widely used in NLP tasks including causality extraction. Some researchers [3] focused on finding language expression of causality and extracting causal triplets from explicit causality sentences. In Table 1 , for sentence like the first line, phrase \"lead to\" indicate the causality blocked by adjacent punctuation explicitly. For sentence like the second line, explicit cause and effect distribute in two adjacent blocks. For sentence like the third line, the cause \"Reduced food production\" and the effect \"falling prices of gold and silver\" are hidden implicitly. As being distributed in nonadjacent sentient blocks or lacking of causality indicators, mining inter-sentence or implicit causality is harder when compared with that of intra-sentence and explicit causality. Regardless of implicit causality in nonadjacent sentence blocks like the last line. This paper proposes model CSNN a novel and unified inter-sentence or implicit causality extraction model. The CSNN model can be described in three steps. Firstly, CNN [2] captures local important features from different blocks of sentences. Secondly, fully considering the extracted advanced features correlation, we cluster the extracted advanced features, and establish semantic relevant characteristics between different features using self-attention. Thirdly and finally, BiLSTM [5] is employed to capture long dependencies between cause and effect using the extracted feature before extracting implicit causal relations or inter-sentence causal relations.",

The reason may be that the BiLSTM layer can capture semantic features and establish long dependencies between causal relationships more efficiently. Besides, BiL-STM layer can understand the relationship between causal features and effect characteristics through forward LSTM, and enhance the relationship between effects and causes through reverse LSTM. In addition, we find that the combination of CNN and BiLSTM approach captures more local feature information using CNN, and BiLSTM enhances connections to longer dependencies, yielding better results for causal relation extraction (Fig. 2) . For best verifying whether our self-attention mechanism can learn semantics and relevant characteristics between different features, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the causal extraction task. Specifically, through ablation experiment can find that the self-attention mechanism provides significant improvements in the causal extraction task. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the CSNN model can automatically learn semantics and related features between different features, which is useful for inter-sentence or implicit causality extraction. Besides, we also find that BiLSTM plays an important role in capturing dependencies between causal relationships, thereby improving the accuracy and recall of causality extraction.",

The convolutional layer is aimed to capture important features within the windows of causality, but lacks internal correlation learning of important features. For example, in the sentence \"the important reason for the repurchase is that Chengdian Medical Star's performance is not up to standard\", the reason is \"Performance is not up to standard\" and the result is \"for the repurchase\". When the sliding window is 3, the model can learn the overall characteristics of the words \"performance\", \"not\" and \"up to standard\", but the relationship between \"not \"and\" up to standard\" can not be learned. Experiments show that in the causality extraction task, self-attention helps to define the cause or result boundary by learning the characteristics of internal words, and makes the cause or result more closely connected in a window. Thus, the effect of causality extraction is improved. Figure 3 shows some typical cases of inter-sentence or implicit causal extraction to show the advantages and disadvantages of our proposed model compared with other methods. Figure 3a is an example of an implicit causal relationship. Only CSNN captures the relationship between them internally and accurately extracts the causal-effect description. For the causality extraction model, learning the intrinsic relationship of causality is very helpful in defining the boundary.",

Existing methods mainly focus on mining intra-sentence or explicit causality, while neglecting the causal relations that expressed implicitly or hidden in inter-sentences. In this paper, we proposed a new method named Cascaded multi-Structure Neural Network (CSNN) for the task of inter-sentence or implicit causality extraction. In the proposed model, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with self-attention mechanism, and CRF layer are employed to capture semantic relevant characteristics. The output of CNN and self-attention are concatenated as high-level phrase representations, which improves the performance of intersentence or implicit causality extraction. The output of CRF layer is the label of each word in inter-sentence or implicit causal relation sentences. In the experiment, we created three annotation datasets on a wide range of public data, which will be released to facilitate ongoing research. The results shown that our model achieved stat-of-the-art performs by improving the F1-scores of causal extraction up to 82.27% and F1-scores of effect extraction up to 75.34% on the created datasets.",
