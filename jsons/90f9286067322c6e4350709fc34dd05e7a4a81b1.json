Utilitarian and rights-based solutions were paraded, civic duties evoked, and the virtue of obedience stressed. In popular contributions by academic philosophers and jurisprudents, colleagues have risen up to the challenge and turned into the firefighters that Tuija Takala predicted in her 2005 article \"Demagogues, firefighters, and window dressers: Who are we and what should we be?\" 4 Takala's idea was that bioethics as an academic enterprise has been dead or dormant for decades and that the so-called bioethicists among us either preach their own ideology, run from crisis to crisis verbalizing popular concerns in their own pet language, or contribute to drawing attention away from wider economic and political issues by digging up and addressing solvable local concerns in medicine and healthcare. Firefighting, the middle approach, is a solution for exceptional times, and that is what Finnish bioethicists have chosen to do for now.",

As a default value, it aims at minimizing morbidity and mortality among the population and maximizing health and wellbeing. It may occasionally recognize the plight of minorities or vulnerable populations, but in a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, it prioritizes lives, health, and (time and resources permitting) QALYs. The government and its advisers should aim impartially at the good of as many citizens as possible, and survival and health are the priority. 8 The COVID-19 Pandemic 3 Utilitarian approaches like this are open to criticism from other ethical and legal points of view, particularly from the angle of basic rights. At the time of the government's decision to isolate Uusimaa province, two lawyers, Martin Scheinin and Pauli Rautiainen, argued that human rights were under threat. 9 The public justification of the isolation was to temporarily confine the pandemic, to give hospitals more time to adjust to the situation, and to reduce the risk of overcrowding intensive-care units. Scheinin and Rautiainen pointed out, however, that this decision ignored the human rights of some people in recognized risk groups, especially the elderly. Some of them could have coped better with access to their summer cottages outside Uusimaa. Restricted to their city environments, they could have caught the disease and even died. In the latter case, the government was, to use the ethical metaphors that the lawyers employed, playing God and turning the trolley to sacrifice the few in order to save the many. Scheinin and Rautiainen also stated, among other things, that if even one person dies due to a government decision, it ought not to be made.",

Kauppinen began by criticizing the lawyers' use of the trolley example attributed to Philippa Foot. 13 A runaway trolley threatens to kill five people on the track. At the switch of a lever, a bystander can turn the trolley on a sidetrack and save those on the main track. Unfortunately, a person on the sidetrack will be killed. The rough-and-ready utilitarian solution to sacrifice the one seems coldhearted. Letting the five die seems unintuitive. Kauppinen pointed out that Foot was not rejecting the choice to save five lives at the expense of one, but that she was rather trying to show how this can be condoned without drifting into wholehearted consequentialism and utilitarianism.",

Someone in the ensuing conversation noted that causing deaths can never be a good thing, whether by act or by omission. 16 Point taken, but within the doctrine of double effect we are not allowed to focus on consequences at this point. We have to determine the morality of the choice by other means. Foot's idea apparently was that switching the lever is neutral. The Finnish government's decision could be a different matter, though.

Although the Swedish way of building up herd immunity by \"sacrificing the elderly\" was frowned upon, THL started suggesting that more healthy people also in Finland ought to be allowed to be infected. 20 The logic was that another attack of the pandemic in a few months' time could be prevented by doing so. Economists argued that businesses should be allowed to recover in less constrained circumstances. Educators began to worry that children's learning results suffer with the schools closed. Psychologists warned about the detrimental effects of distance working and home schooling. In the face of these challenges, Kauppinen, true to form, published another opinion piece, this time in an esteemed weekly magazine, insisting that the prevailing restrictions were the right ones and should only be reversed when we know more about the consequences. 21 This is a discussion that can be conducted in purely utilitarian terms. Even the human rights lawyers could redefine their position and say that international treaties offer such powerful protections that ignoring them would reduce happiness and welfare overall (they do not, and with good reason, but they could).

Even in the best case, their contribution is indirect and has to do with the preservation of the political system. Finland aspires to be a liberal democracy with strong commitments to the rule of law, transparent decisionmaking, and participatory governance. None of these is possible in the long run without public debates dissecting what governments do and on what grounds. In this sense, every polite opinion expressed in the media has been valuable.",

Well-formulated arguments could reveal the justifications of political choices and their background assumptions to citizens and decisionmakers alike. People could keep track of what the government is doing and why; and express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction in the next general election. Liberal democracy would flourish. 22 Unfortunately, however, philosophical bioethics has never grown roots in Finland. Individuals have studied bioethical topics, but no master's or doctoral programs exist. The two professors of medical ethics in the country teach healthcare personnel, but their contribution to the current discussion has been limited to a soothing interview 23 and a short descriptive comment 24 on prioritization. 25 The human rights lawyers have their own competence, but in jurisprudence rather than in ethics. The other participants in the public exchange do not have track records in philosophical bioethics.",

Without experience in the field, it is all too easy to think that one's own intuition is a sufficient guide, and to proceed directly to its rationalization by convenient arguments. At least my idea of philosophical bioethics is different, almost scientific, approaching a hypothetico-deductive scrutiny. 26 This would explicate and interpret offered and other possible solutions by rational reconstruction, heeding to the principle of charity, and then evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of these solutions from different ethical viewpoints, including theories of justice. 27, 28, 29, 30 My model is not designed to produce the kind of direct, concrete impact that research funding organizations are currently looking for.
