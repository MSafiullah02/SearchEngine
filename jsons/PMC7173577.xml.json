The norovirus genus is further classified into five genogroups (GI to GV), only three of which (GI, GII, and GIV) are known to infect humans. GIII and GV viruses infect bovines and mice, respectively, and to date these animal viruses have not been shown to infect humans. Viruses in each genogroup are further divided into genotypes (more than 25 have been described) and subgroups. Norwalk virus is a prototype genogroup I genotype 1 (GI.1) virus. The norovirus genome is approximately 7.7 kilobases in size and consists of three open reading frames, the first of which encodes the nonstructural proteins that are essential for virus replication. The second open reading frame encodes the major capsid protein, viral protein 1 (VP1). When it is expressed as a recombinant protein, 180 molecules of VP1 autoassemble into virus-like particles that are critical to the study of noroviral epidemiology and immunity. Human noroviruses have not yet been adapted to cell culture, so diagnosis generally depends on amplification of virus genes by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; see later).",

Rotaviruses are classified into groups A through G on the basis of the presence of cross-reactive antigenic epitopes and their overall genetic relatedness. Group A rotaviruses are the principal enteric pathogen of humans and many other species. Group B viruses have been identified sporadically in outbreaks of adult diarrheal illness in China and more recently in studies of children with sporadic gastroenteritis, principally in India. Group C rotaviruses are relatively infrequently associated with diarrheal disease in humans and animals around the world. Groups D through G rotaviruses have been isolated only from animals, primarily avian species. Rotaviruses are 100-nm particles that have three concentric layers of proteins: the core is composed of VP1, VP2, and VP3 and the segmented, double-stranded RNA genome; the intermediate layer is formed by VP6, the most abundant and antigenic structural viral protein; and the external layer is composed of VP7 and VP4. The genome is composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA that together are approximately 18 kilobases and encode six structural and six nonstructural proteins. As is the case among virtually all other RNA viruses, the rotavirus RNA polymerase is error prone and, along with selective pressure such as the evolution of immunity, drives viral diversity. For rotaviruses, gene reassortment, which is the mixing of gene segments from different parental viruses in cells coinfected by two or more strains, and rearrangement of the viral genome also contribute to genetic diversity. Reassortment of gene segments between animal and human rotavirus strains also occurs in natural settings, especially in less developed countries.",

The frequency of detection (by PCR assays) of these viruses in individuals with acute gastroenteritis depends on the setting, but they are almost always detected less frequently than rotaviruses and noroviruses. Coronaviruses (Chapter 374), toroviruses, picobirnaviruses, picornavirus (Chapter 387), bocavirus, parechoviruses, and pestiviruses have also been isolated occasionally from persons with acute gastroenteritis, but their roles as causative agents of enteric disease remain uncertain.

Outbreaks frequently take place in settings of close human contact, such as military establishments, cruise ships, nursing homes, and schools, especially in cold and dry weather (see Table 388-1).

This pattern is not seen, however, in countries within 10 degrees of the equator, where infection occurs in an endemic fashion year-round. Before the introduction of rotavirus vaccination, a yearly wave of rotaviral illness spread across the United States and Europe following peculiar spatiotemporal patterns. In the United States, this pattern of spread has been correlated with variation in birth rates, thereby suggesting that the number of babies experiencing their first infection is one of the primary drivers of rotavirus epidemics. The high birth rates in developing countries may also influence the differential epidemiologic distribution of rotaviruses. Antibodies against the outer capsid proteins are the basis of serotypic classification of rotaviruses into G (glycoprotein, VP7) and P (protease-sensitive, VP4) serotypes. For technical reasons, P serotyping reagents are infrequently available, and classification is based on the P genotype (provided in brackets). Worldwide, most human infections are caused by five types of group A rotavirus; P[8]G1 is by far the most common (approximately 53% of strains), followed by P[8]G3, P[4]G2, P[8]G9, and P[8]G4. In some developing areas like India, Brazil, and Africa, P[6]G9, G5, and G8 rotaviruses, respectively, are most frequently encountered. Some human rotavirus strains may have arisen after reassortment with bovine or porcine rotaviruses. A high prevalence of G12 viruses has recently been observed in several countries, thereby suggesting that this serotype may be an emerging rotavirus strain.",

It has also been postulated that viral infection increases intestinal motility by stimulating the enteric nervous system, possibly through NSP4. Whether and to what degree the enterotoxic effect of NSP4 is clinically relevant in children or other animal species remains to be determined.

In children younger than 11 years, disease typically begins with the sudden onset of vomiting and can last 4 to 6 days. Virus can be shed in low titers for up to 8 weeks from otherwise healthy individuals and for more than a year in patients with severe immunodeficiency syndromes. In neonates and premature infants, vomiting often is not a symptom, and infection has been associated with necrotizing enterocolitis. To support the diagnosis of norovirus outbreaks, the following four criteria have been proposed: (1) vomiting in more than half of affected persons; (2) mean (or median) incubation period of 24 to 48 hours; (3) mean (or median) duration of illness of 12 to 60 hours; and (4) absence of bacterial pathogens in stool culture.",

PCR has increased sensitivity for detection of rotavirus and has permitted easy typing of viruses. With PCR-based methods, however, up to 29% of healthy children younger than 1 year may be rotavirus positive, so it is difficult to associate the detection of the virus with gastroenteritis.

The World Health Organization now recommends the routine use of these vaccines.Treatment Because both norovirus and rotavirus disease resolves within days without treatment, the basic therapeutic goal is to prevent acute dehydration. The recommended oral rehydration salts solution, which now has an osmolarity of 331 mmol/L, is as effective as higher osmolarity solutions.6 After rehydration, rapid age-appropriate refeeding is recommended. Rotavirus disease induces self-limited intestinal lactase deficiency, but lactose-containing products, particularly maternal milk, should not be withheld.Passive oral immunotherapy with diverse preparations of immunoglobulins can shorten the duration of rotavirus infection but probably is economically feasible only for immunodeficient patients or low-birthweight infants. Lactobacillus, a bacterium present in yogurt, is safe and, in limited studies, appears moderately effective for treatment of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. Nonetheless, different preparations of lactobacilli vary greatly in dose of bacteria, and a general recommendation on their use has not been issued. Several studies in developing countries have shown that zinc supplementation (10 mg/day for infants younger than 6 months and 20 mg/day for older children) is useful for the treatment and prevention of diarrhea, but further studies are needed to determine whether treatment will be useful in all developing and developed countries.At present, no pharmacologic treatment of rotavirus or norovirus diarrhea is recommended. Racecadotril (4.5 mg/kg per day), an enkephalinase inhibitor that acts on the enteric nervous system, has been shown to be useful as an adjunct to treat rotaviral diarrhea in several small studies. Ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg per day), a serotonin antagonist, is effective in reducing the emesis from gastroenteritis during the phase of oral rehydration. In several small studies, nitazoxanide (15 mg/kg per day) was helpful in the treatment of rotavirus gastroenteritis. More studies are needed before any of these various preparations can be generally recommended for treatment of rotavirus diarrhea.\n",
