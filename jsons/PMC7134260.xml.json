Furthermore, when customers need to use information systems, bad usability leads to a lack of loyalty, desertion of tasks (such as cart abandonment) and a decrease in satisfaction [1, 2]. Market research suggests that poor usability is the biggest reason why mobile applications are rejected by customers [3]. Sykes and Venkatesh [4] explain that the potential of using enterprise software within organisations is limited because many implementations fail due to a lack of usability testing. They suggest that in addition to testing the usability of customer facing systems, it is important to examine how people use enterprise software systems to do their work and achieve their goals. It is vital that the usability of systems, such as mobile applications and business intelligence systems, remains optimal for organisations to gain and maintain a competitive advantage [5]. For example, a usable system may lead to a reduction in system transaction time, which could have direct cost benefits [6].",

The user makes less mistakes and completes tasks more effectively when the usability of an information system is optimal, (3) The enhanced performance of users that are completing a task, (4) Enhanced user efficiency and satisfaction, (5) Lower personnel cost for organisations due to computer based tasks being completed more effectively and efficiently by employees, (6) Reduced software development cost and length of the development lifecycle because users are more satisfied with systems, (7) Easier to use online interfaces for enhanced customer interactions, (8) Improved competitive advantage.",

Benchmarking is important because it allows organisations to set standards, measure the effectiveness of operations and processes, and analyse competitive advantage [10]. Organisations often conduct comparative studies to benchmark [11]. Comparative studies may be conducted at the inception, during operations and at the closure of an organisation. Stakeholders in an organisation may have various questions that could be answered through benchmarking. These include why some competing organisations are doing better than others, what the strengths and weaknesses of an organisation are, and why certain organisations may easily mitigate threats and take advantage of opportunities [12\u201314]. Similar questions could be asked about the organisation\u2019s competition and this may enable the organisation posing the questions to gain competitive advantage [12\u201314].",

Furthermore, it was found that CIUEs can be useful in selecting IS products based on usability, to work towards the benchmarking of the usability of user interfaces, to scale the value of an investment made in usability enhancements, to encourage the use of usability enhancement mechanisms to gain competitive advantage.",
