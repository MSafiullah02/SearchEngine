Myoid giant cells (white arrow) and interstitial ecstatic lymphovascular structures with inflammatory cell infiltration are evident (HE stain, 100\u00c2). (c) The kidney from case 2. There are several Mallory body-like casts (arrowhead) in dilated lumens with some sloughed and flattened renal tubular epithelial cells, indicating rhabdomyolysis and acute tubular necrosis. Interstitial infiltration of mononuclear cells is evident. There was a mild increase in mesangial cellularity and matrix (HE, 200\u00c2). (d) The glomerulus of case 2 (electron microscopy). Intact basement membrane surrounded by podocytes (\u00c211 500). There was no immune complex deposition or virus particles.",
