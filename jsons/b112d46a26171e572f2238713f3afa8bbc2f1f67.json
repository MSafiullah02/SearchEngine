Due to current technological deficiencies, accurate determination of the presence of airborne viruses is challenging. This shortcoming limits our ability to evaluate the actual threat arising from inhalation or other relevant contact with aerosolized viruses. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms of airborne transmission of viruses, air sampling technologies that can detect the presence of aerosolized viruses, effectively collect them and maintain their viability, and determine their distribution in aerosol particles, are needed. The latest developments in sampling and detection methodologies for airborne viruses, their limitations, factors that can affect their performance and current research needs, are discussed in this review. Much more work is needed on the establishment of standard air sampling methods and their performance requirements. Sampling devices that can collect a wide size range of virus-containing aerosols and maintain the viability of the collected viruses are needed. Ideally, the devices would be portable and technology-enabled for on-the-spot detection and rapid identification of the viruses.

Any respiratory pathogens able to remain viable (infectious) after aerosolization and air transport are a potential cause of respiratory disease, and they are often associated with other substances to form 'complex particles' (Tang 2009 ). An example of a complex particle would be an influenza virion within a droplet composed of mucus, salts and water. Virus-containing aerosols can be formed through natural occurrences, for example, sneezing by an individual harbouring a respiratory virus infection, or through mechanical means, for example, when air currents around contaminated surfaces disperse the viruses into the air (Verreault et al. 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 359, "text": "(Tang 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 751, "end": 774, "text": "(Verreault et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The dimensions of aerosolized virus particles vary widely, ranging from nanometre (e.g. 'naked' virus particles) to micrometre (e.g. viruses associated with nonviable particles) (Gerone et al. 1966) . Once airborne, small particles containing virus(es) can remain airborne for long periods of time, allowing for their transport to other locations (Fig. 1) . They also remain adrift in air (i.e. airborne) for longer periods of time primarily because of their low settling velocity, for example, from 3\u00c11 9 10 \u00c03 m s \u00c01 for 10-lm particles to 3\u00c15 9 10 \u00c05 m s \u00c01 for 1 lm particles (Hinds 1998 ). Among nose breathers, larger particles (>5 lm) tend to deposit on the surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, whereas inhalation of small particles into the lower lungs may pose a greater risk for pneumonia/severe infection than what occurs with deposition onto the upper respiratory tract (Vincent 2005; Killingley and Nguyen-Van-Tam 2013) . Overall, smaller particles that contain respiratory viruses are potentially more dangerous because they stay airborne longer (and thus the risk for acquiring an infection is prolonged), and they get inhaled into the lower lungs, potentially causing diseases with more severe outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 198, "text": "(Gerone et al. 1966)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 580, "end": 591, "text": "(Hinds 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 886, "end": 900, "text": "(Vincent 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 901, "end": 936, "text": "Killingley and Nguyen-Van-Tam 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 347, "end": 355, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Adequate understanding about the routes of airborne virus transmission is important for protecting public health, especially as infection control procedures relevant for the spread of respiratory pathogens are founded on this body of knowledge. Based on current dogma, for example, the World Health Organization recommends that when possible, a patient with respiratory illness should be kept at least 1 m away from others to reduce spread of epidemic or pandemic-prone respiratory diseases (WHO, 2014) . Transmission of airborne viruses from one subject to another occurs mainly by three routes or a combination thereof: (i) direct or indirect contact of infectious secretions from infected hosts with mucus membranes of susceptible hosts, (ii) contact of virus-containing droplets with surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, and (iii) inhalation of small aerosolized virus-containing particles or droplet nuclei (droplet and aerosol transmissions are compared in Fig. 1 ). The relative importance of different transmission modes varies from one virus to another, with droplet transmission being traditionally regarded as the main route for respiratory viruses (Gerone et al. 1966; Gralton et al. 2011 ). However, due to inherent limitations of conventional impingement/impaction-based bioaerosol samplers, which have low collection efficiencies for nanosized particles containing infectious viruses (Hogan et al. 2005; Cao et al. 2011) , the aerosol transmission mode has not been adequately investigated. Nevertheless, evidence is mounting that aerosols are important for the transmission of airborne viruses . For example, Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) has been proven to be transmitted by the aerosol mode (Gustafson et al. 1982; Gardam and Lemieux 2007) ; VZV DNA was detected in rooms of patients without varicella in a hospital with VZV-infected patients (Sawyer et al. 1994) , and directional airflow was consistent with VZV transmission (Gustafson et al. 1982) . The importance of the aerosol transmission mode is still debated for influenza viruses. Although droplet infection is the commonly described mode of transmission for influenza viruses, they have also been detected in aerosols 'far away' (>1 m) from infected patients in a few studies. For example, influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, and B viruses, were collected by a water-based sampler located >2 m from patients in a student infirmary (Pan et al. 2017) , and airborne influenza A H3N2 was collected by a Sioutas impactor 3\u00c17 m away from sick individuals (Lednicky and Loeb 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 491, "end": 502, "text": "(WHO, 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1184, "text": "(Gerone et al. 1966;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1185, "end": 1204, "text": "Gralton et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1422, "text": "(Hogan et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1439, "text": "Cao et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1735, "text": "(Gustafson et al. 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1760, "text": "Gardam and Lemieux 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1884, "text": "(Sawyer et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1971, "text": "(Gustafson et al. 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2404, "end": 2421, "text": "(Pan et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 2523, "end": 2547, "text": "(Lednicky and Loeb 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 967, "end": 973, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Outbreaks due to respiratory viruses spread through aerosol routes can result in pandemics. A recent estimate indicates that up to 646 000 persons in the world die every year of influenza (Iuliano et al. 2017) . As the world population grows, modern agricultural production systems have greatly expanded, and these large-scale operations provide enzootic opportunities for the spread of novel pathogens through aerosol routes (Jones et al. 2008; Sarkar et al. 2012) . Increasing threats of bioterrorist attacks performed through aerosol dissemination of dangerous pathogens have also increased the need to develop methods for rapid detection and identification of airborne microbes (Mirski et al. 2014) . Prompt and accurate detection of airborne pathogens and their identification are key to mitigating these biothreats that may have pandemic potential; they enable minimal exposure of personnel, minimal contamination of surfaces and when possible, allow for the initiation of early treatment, effective decontamination and infection control procedures, and for the selection of protective countermeasures. Methods to better and more reliably measure the concentration, size of particles carrying these viruses and transmission modes of aerosolized virus particles, in relation to their potential risks to humans and animals, are also needed to understand the principles that govern airborne virus transmission from host to host. This knowledge is of foremost importance for infection control.

True sampling efficiency is determined in two ways: (i) physical efficiency, which is the ratio of the amount of the collected particles to the amount of particles in the ambient environment, and (ii) biological efficiency, which is a measure of the fraction of biologically active virus that remains viable after collection (Hogan et al. 2005; Kulkarni et al. 2011) . The physical efficiency is usually determined by measuring the particle number concentrations at the sampler's inlet and the exit, with the inlet loss and wall losses ignored (Lin et al. 2000) . As an aid in data interpretation, tracers have been used for estimating the efficiency through comparison of the collected tracer mass concentration with the total tracer mass concentration at the inlet (Orsini et al. 2008) . Disadvantages of these tracers are the deactivation of viruses due to the tracer, the interference of tracers in further analyses of the samples (e.g. overlapping fluorescence wavelength) and the difficulty in homogeneously attaching tracers to particles. The biological efficiency is usually determined by comparing the infectious virus count measured by a viability assay, for example, plaque assay (infectious virus titre defined in terms of plaqueforming units or PFU per ml) or median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) per ml for the collected material, with the total generated infectious virus count calculated from the liquid consumption rate in the aerosol generator (Hogan et al. 2005) . Alternatively, the virus DNA or RNA genome-equivalent measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used. Tracers have also been used to evaluate the biological efficiency by comparing the ratios of the virus count to tracers' fluorescence intensity in both the particles entering the sampler and those collected by the sampler (Appert et al. 2012; Zuo et al. 2013) . The same principles for sampling bacterial and fungal aerosols are typically used for aerosolized viruses (Lindsley et al. 2017) . These samplers separate the particles from the airstream utilizing various physical mechanisms (Henningson and Ahlberg 1994) . The movement of an airborne particle is described in terms of its aerodynamic diameter, which is the diameter of a sphere with unit density having the same settling velocity as the particle (Hinds 1998) . Particles with larger aerodynamic diameters have higher inertia (i.e. tendency to maintain their current state) and can be easily separated from the airstream through impaction. Particles with a smaller diameter (<100 nm) can be collected using their higher diffusivity (a measure of the rate at which particles spread), or size-enlarged through condensation to enable impaction. Various aerosol samplers based on these principles have been used to recover airborne viruses ( Fig. 2 ) (Henningson and Ahlberg 1994; Pillai and Ricke 2002; Verreault et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2011) .

They are active samplers that require a vacuum pump to draw in the aerosol, and particles in the incoming airstream get accelerated through small nozzles (in the form of holes or slits). As they are pulled through these devices, particles with high inertia impact onto the surface of collection media (Fig. 2) (Andersen 1958) . Then, the collection media are recovered and aliquots thereof used for virus isolation or other analyses (Verreault et al. 2008) . For example, a high-resolution slit sampler with liquid collection medium was used for the collection of airborne Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (Booth et al. 2005) ; in that work, all virus cultures were negative, although 2 of the 10 samples were RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) positive. Reasons for the negative results might be that viruses were present in the air at relatively low levels or that these devices were inadequate for sampling aerosolized viruses. Practical limitations for the design of common impactors limit the smallest cut-off size (particle diameter with 50% collection efficiency) to 0\u00c12-0\u00c13 lm.

However, free virus particles can be smaller than 100 nm, and thus would not be collected efficiently. Modification of conventional cyclone samplers has somewhat improved their performance (Kenny et al. 2017) . One sampler developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (Lindsley et al. 2006 ) is a multistage cyclone operating at a flowrate of 3\u00c15 l min \u00c01 : the first stage is a 15-ml tube that collects aerosol particles >4 lm, the second is a 1\u00c15 ml tube that collects particles between 1 and 4 lm, and the third is a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter that captures those <1 lm. Using this sampler to collect laboratory-generated influenza A H1N1 virus aerosols inside a settling chamber, Cao et al. (2011) found that its collection efficiency for total quantity of collected viruses as measured by RT-PCR was the same as that attained by sampling with an SKC BioSampler (considered the industry standard) for 15 min. With the BioSampler as a reference, however, only 34% of the viruses collected by the NIOSH cyclone remained infectious, probably due to desiccation. Blachere et al. (2009) used the NIOSH cyclone to collect airborne influenza virus in a hospital emergency department. They found that influenza A virus (IAV) RNA was detected by RT-PCR in 11 out of 81 samples, and more than half of the aerosol particles that contained the virus were <4 lm, within the respirable particle size range (inhaled particles capable of passing beyond the ciliated airways) (Brown et al. 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 396, "end": 419, "text": "(Cooper and Alley 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 611, "end": 630, "text": "(Kenny et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 724, "end": 745, "text": "(Lindsley et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1168, "text": "Cao et al.

Aliquots of collection media from both devices were used for RT-PCR and virus isolation in cell cultures. All three viruses were found in that study, and there was no difference in geometric mean particle concentration in samples collected by either the cyclone or the ACI. Despite advancements in cyclone design, cut-off sizes for these devices (mostly >1 lm) cannot meet the sampling requirements for small-sized virus-containing particles. Moreover, physical damage resulting from the actions of cyclones can deactivate viruses, resulting in an underestimate of the infectious viruses collected (Bourgueil et al. 1992) . A capability to collect particles containing viruses in different particle size ranges is the major advantage of using the ACI. For particles >1 lm, the ACI or similar devices are the main samplers for size-selective sampling (Xu and Yao 2013; Alonso et al. 2015) .

For example, mineral oil, which is non-nutritive and thus does not support the replication of micro-organisms but nevertheless maintains them live (which is important for accurate enumeration of the collected agents), cannot be used for viruses.

Second, Han and Mainelis (2012) found that the adhesion of the deposited particles (fluorescent Polystyrene Latex (PSL)) and Bacillus subtilis cells and Cladosporium cladosporioides spores to the inner wall of the BioSampler was as high as 30% and the reaerosolization rates ranged from 0\u00c12% to 6\u00c19%. For the AGI-30, Riemenschneider et al. (2010) found that reaerosolization of MS2 bacteriophage (single virion particle size~28 nm) increases as the flow rate increases. Moreover, Hogan et al. (2005) found the collection efficiencies of the AGI-30, the BioSampler and frit bubblers for bacteriophages MS2 and T3 (single virion particle siz\u1ebd 45 nm) are below 10% in the size range of 20-100 nm. The 50% cut-off sizes of both the BioSampler and the AGI-30 are 300 nm at 12\u00c15 l min \u00c01 . Anwar (2010) found that 8 l min \u00c01 for the BioSampler was more effective for the sampling of MS2 aerosols due to collection by diffusion and maintenance of virus infectivity. While collection by diffusion is enhanced at a low flow rate, reduction in flow rate results in lower physical collection efficiency that relies on inertia. Hence, caution should be exercised in further reduction in the flow rate, and research to determine the optimal flow rate for sampling airborne virus is warranted. Finally, the BioSampler's high centrifugal force also inactivates a significant fraction of influenza viruses (Fabian et al. 2009; Lednicky et al. 2016) . Hence, new samplers for airborne viruses that allow for less violent but efficient sampling in the wide size range of virus-containing particles are in great need.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 184, "end": 213, "text": "(Henningson and Ahlberg 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 572, "end": 601, "text": "(Henningson and Ahlberg 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 602, "end": 624, "text": "Grinshpun et al. 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 896, "end": 919, "text": "(Grinshpun et al. 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 920, "end": 940, "text": "Seshadri et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1121, "text": "Han and Mainelis (2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1436, "text": "Riemenschneider et al.

The collection efficiencies of gelatin filters for viable hydrophilic viruses were found to be 10 times better than for Nucleopore polycarbonate filters, since many hydrophilic viruses need to be hydrated to remain viable (Tseng and Li 2005) . Nevertheless, sampling and extraction problems still prevail with gelatin filters. Fabian et al. (2009) retrieved 23% of the total viable IAV using a gelatin filter, whereas 100% could be retrieved from the BioSampler during bench top virus spike recovery experiments. A simple system composed of a portable MD8 air sampler connected by a hose to a gelatin filter was used for the capture of influenza viruses in cough aerosols, although virus deactivation was reported to be a problem (Hatagishi et al. 2014) . Sampling conditions are very important for successful virus collection on gelatin filters; low RH can lead to desiccation of viruses and high RH leads to dissolution of gelatin filters (Verreault et al. 2008) . These filters must be used in short periods of time (<15 min sampling time) as they dry out quickly, and at higher temperatures they melt (Fabian et al. 2009 ). Thus, filter-collected viruses are typically more suitable for molecular analyses than for assessments of infectivity, as desiccation, extraction and postsampling processes significantly inactivate a significant fraction of the infectious viruses (Li et al. 1999; Tseng and Li 2005; Burton et al. 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 235, "text": "Zhao et al.

The ESP works by creating a corona discharge that places charges on airborne particles, resulting in an electrostatic attraction that draws the charged particles to electrodes ( Fig. 2;  Hinds 1998) . The ESP has a size-dependent collection efficiency; total mass-based collection efficiencies are high (e.g. 99%), but typically low for submicrometre or nanometre particles (Yoo et al. 1997; Kettleson et al. 2009 ). Jang et al.

Problems with this device are its inability to collect larger particles (>10 lm), which are less likely to swirl as a result of increased inertia compared to viruses in nanometre ranges. Also, fewer Vaccinia viruses were collected compared with nanoparticles of similar size as the viruses could aggregate to form large particles rather than remaining as individual particles. Hong et al. (2016) applied a personal ESP for sampling submicrometre-sized MS2 and T3 viruses, and found out that the recovery rate for MS2 and T3 were more than 10 times higher than the BioSampler at 12\u00c15 l min \u00c01 ; its collection efficiency at the flow rate of 1\u00c12 l min \u00c01 reached 99\u00c13-99\u00c18% for 0\u00c105-2-lm diameter PSL particles, although the efficiency for virus-containing particles is not available.

This includes introduction of cooled aerosols into warm wet-walled growth tubes to minimize wall losses (Oh et al. 2010) , and maintaining the condensation system at a lower temperature to sustain the viability of viruses being sampled (Orsini et al. 2003 ).

These results indicate the GTC can be used for surveillance of airborne viruses. The GTC mimics what happens in human lungs on a cold day by introducing cold aerosol particles into a warm growth tube saturated with water vapour. This process encapsulates small particles into larger droplets, thus enabling efficient collection of these enlarged particles through gentle impaction (Fig. 2) .

Overall, the collection efficiencies for airborne viruses by samplers such as the water-based CPC or the integration of inertial or diffusion-based samplers have improved steadily, but development is still needed for light-weight and portable samplers that can collect a variety of infectious airborne viruses present in a wide size range of aerosolized particles. Until a standard sampler and procedure for sampling aerosols containing infectious viruses are developed, our understanding of airborne virus transmission remains stilted. It is impossible to accurately reconcile results from different laboratories that use different samplers based on different sampling and analytical methods for the collection of airborne viruses. Moreover, flow rates used for virus-containing aerosol sampling are generally low (less than 12\u00c15 l min \u00c01 ), and this limits the amount of air that can be sampled. Given the low virus concentration in the air, sampling at high flow rates might facilitate fast detection of airborne viruses, although the associated high flow velocity may damage viruses. Hence, a balance between high volume of sampled air and maintenance of virus viability is needed. Finally, the 'collection efficiencies' reported in many virus aerosol studies are in reality 'relative collection efficiencies'; they are measures of the amount of virus collected by one sampler compared to that collected or calculated by a reference sampler. One reason for this gap in reporting is that a large percentage of the test virus is deactivated during aerosol generation or sampling processes (Zhen et al. 2014; Walls et al. 2016) , and quantification of their inactivation rate proves challenging. The absolute efficiency of a virus sampler is very important for health risk assessments, because even if the tested sampler has high collection efficiency compared with some sampler considered to be state-of-the-art, it might still be possible that both samplers do not collect sufficient quantities of airborne viruses for accurate risk assessments. Thus, future studies should develop reference samplers that have verifiable absolute collection efficiency, although currently there is no clear solution yet.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1683, "end": 1701, "text": "(Zhen et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1720, "text": "Walls et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 82, "end": 89, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Other devices"}, {"text": "While each sampler's efficiency is dependent on the dominating collection mechanism, other factors can also affect their performance, including RH, temperature, light, irradiation, suspension media and sampling media (Benbough 1971) . Biological collection efficiency of these samplers also strongly depends on the sampling conditions, aerosolilzation method and the virus type, such as virus morphology, surface charge and the hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature of the viruses (Tseng and Li 2005) . Relative humidity is one commonly studied factor for biological collection efficiency (Cox and Wathes 1995) . If aerosolized, non-lipid-enveloped viruses can be unstable below about 70% RH as a result of denaturation of virus surface structures. In contrast, lipid-enveloped viruses such as vaccinia virus, may have reduced stability in air if RH is above 70% (Cox 1987; Tellier 2006) . These observations fit well with the general belief that phospholipid-protein complexes in enveloped viruses are usually more likely to denature in the air at medium to high RH, whereas the protein coats of non-enveloped viruses are more readily to denature at low RH (Cox and Wathes 1995) . One the other hand, when influenza virus is suspended in a medium that closely mimics respiratory tract fluids, the effect of humidity on survival is greatly diminished (Kormuth et al. 2018) . Transmission of airborne viruses is also affected by RH; another plausible explanation for the fact that influenza is more likely to occur in winter (low RH) is that settling of airborne viruses due to condensation occurs to a lower extent in winter, and therefore the chances of inhaling airborne influenza viruses is much greater than during summer (high RH) (Lowen et al. 2007) . Moreover, RH is important in filtration collection, as desiccation has always been a problem for viruses trapped on filters (Tseng and Li 2005; Fabian et al. 2009; Lindsley et al. 2010) .

Natural virus-containing particles consist of multiple components and are usually irregular in shape; both factors make size distribution measurement of virus-containing particles challenging. Particle physics-based devices like the Cascade Impactor, the Optical Particle Counter (OPC), the Wide Range Aerosol Spectrometer, the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) and the Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), are commonly used. They provide physical counts of the particles, but no information about viruses contained in the particles. Problems arise in getting size distribution of particles in a wide size range (20 nm-10 lm), as each device can only cover certain range of particle size, for example, both SMPS and OPC were used in Yu et al.'s (2018) study to measure the size distribution of MS2-containing particles from 27 nm to more than 10 lm. Liu et al. (2010) introduced a system capable of measuring aerosol size distributions from 10 nm to 10 lm in diameter, which included an SMPS for particle measurement from 0\u00c101 to 0\u00c15 lm and a Laser Particle Spectrometer for measurement in 0\u00c14-10 lm range. Another problem is the definition of particle size. The APS measures aerodynamic particle size (Baron 1986) , particle sizing of the OPC is based on single particle's elastic light scattering that follows the Mie theory (Heyder and Gebhart 1979), while the SMPS is based on the particles' electrical mobility (Wang and Flagan 1990) .

Reviews of these methods are available in published literature (Pillai and Ricke 2002; Xu et al. 2011) . However, it is very important to note that detection of nucleic acid in aerosol does not correlate with virus viability in the aerosol. The ability to detect both nonviable and viable viruses, and determine the fraction thereof that is infectious, is important for risk assessments, as nonviable viruses do not cause infections. Electron microscopy has also been attempted in some studies to identify virus particles, for example, avian infectious laryngotracheitis viruses in the study of Williams et al.

Promising technologies include loop-mediated isothermal amplification, which has the potential to detect and offer a presumptive identification of a virus in under an hour, as demonstrated for influenza virus (Mori and Notomi 2009) , and real-time PCR. However, more work is needed towards the integration of these technologies with air sampling devices. Shen et al. (2011) developed a sensor for real-time detection of influenza H3N2 virus by integrating silicon nanowire field effect transistors, microfluidics and electrostatic air sampling. Although they successfully detected influenza viruses, this device has low charging efficiency for nanometre-sized virus particles, that is, they do not easily get charged and thus not captured efficiently. Usachev et al. (2012) described several technologies used in conjunction with a personal bioaerosol sampler for real-time detection of viruses. They found that real-time PCR technique allows detection of bacteriophages MS2 and T4, but the whole procedure takes a long time (h). The combination of a personal sampler with surface plasmon resonance (SPR)based immunosensor allows for rapid detection of MS2; the entire sampling and analysis procedure can be done in 6 min (Usachev et al. 2013) . Later, Usachev et al. (2015) used multiplexed SPR for simultaneous detection of MS2 bacteriophage and IAV. The SPR response units increased with increasing virus concentration, and the sensitivity of this technology was high enough to minimize false alarm. Although the overall response for multiplex SPR slightly decreased compared with singleplex SPR, there was no statistical difference in sensitivity between the two for the target viruses. A limitation with these types of real-time samplers and analyses is that at the current state-of-art, viruses can only be detected when they are present at relatively high concentrations. For example, the detection limit of the SPR was 7 9 10 7 PFU per ml in the sampling liquids, with a liquid volume of 0\u00c11 ml used in their work, whereas for viruses such as IAV, the quantity exhaled by human beings might be lower than 1000 per 30 min .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 332, "end": 354, "text": "(Mori and Notomi 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 478, "end": 496, "text": "Shen et al.

No single device has been demonstrated capable of serving as the gold standard sampler, one that can efficiently sample a wide size range (10 nm to >10 lm) of virus-containing aerosols, and conserve the viability of the collected viruses.
