HER2 is over expressed or amplified in 15-20% of breast tumors, and confers a more aggressive clinical behaviour. The introduction of the monoclonal antibody against HER2 trastuzumab led to a substantial improvement of prognosis. In the adjuvant setting, the results of six phase III randomized trials have been published or reported so far, exploring the benefit of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy. Different administrations of trastuzumab in terms of schedule, timing and duration have been tested. Overall, these trials have included more than 10,000 women with HER2 positive breast cancer: five of these trials have demonstrated the superiority of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. Therefore, trastuzumab is now an essential component of the adjuvant treatment plan for HER2 positive disease. However, several issues deserve further attention. First of all, adjuvant trastuzumab is commonly prescribed to HER2\u00fe breast cancer patients irrespectively of nodal status, while the majority of the patients enrolled in the adjuvant trastuzumab trials had nodal involvement. Moreover, no data on patients with node negative disease and tumor size less than 1 cm are available. A growing body of literature is showing that patients with T1a-b,N0 HER2\u00fe tumors have a higher rates of recurrence as compared to HER2-tumors. These data indirectly suggest a potential benefit of trastuzumab based therapy for these patients; however, since this population was not included in the adjuvant trials, the optimal adjuvant therapy is still to be defined. In this perspective, the cardiac safety issue appear even more important. In spite of applying careful patient selection in respect of cardiac function and cardiac morbidities, both symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac dysfunctions have been reported in the majority of large trastuzumab adjuvant trials. In particular, even if reversible in the majority of the cases, the clinical impact of asymptomatic LVEF decline on long term cardiac morbidity and morbility is still unknown. The optimal trastuzumab duration is still a matter of debate; the choice of 1 year administration in the adjuvant trials have an empirical basis only. The data from the 2year arm of HERA are still lacking. Exploring potentially less toxic regimens remain a major clinical issue. Several large randomized trials exploring shorter trastuzumab duration are ongoing across several European countries (the Phare trial in France, the Sold trial in Finland and other north European countries, The Persephone trial in UK, and The Short-Her trial in Italy). Other anti-HER2 agents are under evaluation as adjuvant therapy for HER2 positive breast cancer. The dual TK inhibitor of HER1 and HER2 lapatinib is currently approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer failing trastuzumab therapy. A large phase III randomized adjuvant study, the ALLTO trial, has completed the accrual. Neratinib, a TK inhibitor of HER1, 2 and 4, is under evaluation in a large randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled adjuvant study in patients who have completed adjuvant trastuzumab no longer than 2 years before and free from recurrence.",

            "text": "Intra-operative radiotherapy for breast cancer; an innovative approach for the 21st century Lecture: Intra-operative radiotherapy for breast cancer; an innovative approach for the 21st century Jeffrey Tobias (on behalf of the TARGTI Trialists Group) Background: Following breast conserving surgery, about 90% of ''inbreast'' local recurrences occur within the index quadrant, despite the presence of multicentric cancers elsewhere in the breast. We therefore felt that restricting the radiation therapy to the tumour bed might be adequate in selected patients with early breast cancer, with the potential advantage that it might be possible to deliver this form of targeted irradiation as a single intraoperative treatment during the definitive surgical excision, under the same general anaesthetic. This approach would potentially have significant benefits both for patients and also for healthcare systems. Methods: Having safely piloted the new technique of single dose targeted intra-operative radiotherapy (TARGIT) using Intrabeam [first patient treated at UCH in 1998 and pilot study published 2001], we launched the TARGIT-A trial (www.thelancet.com/protocol-reviews/99PRT-47) on 24 March 2000. Female patients >\u00bc 45 years with localised invasive ductal breast carcinoma suitable for breast conserving surgery were randomly allocated to receive either TARGIT (i.e ''Single-shot'' intra-operative radiotherapy), or whole breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Postoperative discovery of predefined factors (e.g., lobular carcinoma) could trigger addition of EBRT to TARGIT, which proved necessary, in the opinion of the supervising team, in about 15% of cases. In other words, in about 85% of patients randomly allocated to the TARGIT arm, no additional EBRT was given. The primary outcome measure of the study, analysed by intention-to-treat, was a non-inferiority margin (2.5%) of local recurrence in the conserved breast. Patients could be treated by TARGIT at the definitive surgical procedure (''pre-pathology group'') or after histological assessment of the excised specimen (''post-pathology group''). Either of these pre-defined policies was acceptable within the trial protocol. Findings: 2232 patients were randomized from 28 international centres over 10 years. The study has enough patients with a median follow up of more than 4 years to detect the original non-inferiority margin of 2.5% with an 80% power and 95% confidence. Median age was 63 yrs (IQR 57-69), median tumour size 12mm (IQR 9-18mm), lymph node involvement 17% \u00feve. The overall number of complications and major toxicity (37/1113 TARGIT vs. 44/1119 EBRT, p \u00bc 0.44) were equivalent, but radiotherapy toxicity (RTOG grade 3) was lower in the TARGIT group: 6 vs. 23 (p \u00bc 0.004). The combined surgical-TARGIT treatment added approx 40 min to the overall operative time, but avoided 15-25 visits (more, in some centres) for treatment, preceded by at least one visit for radiotherapy treatment planning. At a follow-up period of 4 years, there was no significant difference in the Kaplan-Meier estimate of local recurrence in the conserved breast between TARGIT and EBRT [1.2% (95%CI 0.53-2.71) vs. 0.95 (95%CI 0.39-2.3), p \u00bc 0.41]. Interpretation: The TARGIT approach is safe. Local recurrence with single dose TARGIT is comparable to EBRT delivered over several weeks in this selected group of patients, at a 4-yr follow-up. Most patients did not require additional EBRT. Long term follow-up is obviously essential, and will continue. We regard these initial results as extremely encouraging, particularly since breast cancer is such a common condition that this single diagnosis constitutes a substantial portion of the workload of most radiotherapy departments.",

Several molecular alterations can lead to mTOR activation including tyrosine kinase activation (EGFR, Her2, IGF1R. . .), PIK3CA mutations, PTEN loss. Preclinical studies have suggested that aberrant mTOR pathway activation could lead to resistance to endocrine therapy and trastuzumab. Based on this background, mTOR inhibitors have been evaluated either single agent or in combination with standard. When provided as single agent, everolimus induces a 13% response rate in metastatic breast cancer patients, when administered daily. Two phase I trials have evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of adding everolimus to trastuzumab and chemotherapy. These two trials reported high rate of objective response in patients who were refractory to both chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Finally, one phase II randomized trial has evaluated the benefit of adding everolimus to aromatase inhibitors. In this phase II randomized trial, the everolimus arm was associated with an increase rate of clinical response (p \u00bc 0.06) and increased rate of Ki67 normalisation. Based on these early trials, three registration phase III trials have been developed namely BOLERO I, II, III. Two major questions arise regarding the optimal use of mTOR inhibitors. First, preliminary data have suggested that PIK3CA mutations on exon 9 could predict for the efficacy of everolimus when combined with letrozole. Second, several teams have described that inhibiting mTOR could lead to feedback loops that in turn activate intracellular kinase. Based on this observation, the combination between mTOR inhibitors and IGF1R inhibitors has been evaluated and reported to present preliminary signal for efficacy.",

            "text": "The concept of angiogenesis as a target for the treatment of cancer has been considered for many years but only with the biological and molecular identification of one of the key mediators of angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), have clinical trials in this field been truly feasible. Inhibition of VEGF, using antibodies to the ligand, its receptor or inhibitors of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (TKIs), leads to pruning of vasculature and 'normalisation' which may lead to increased delivery of more conventional agents. Such changes have been observed both in animal models and in patients using dynamic contrast MRI. An open-label, randomised phase III study (E2100) testing an antibody to VEGF (bevacizumab) in addition to weekly taxol, yielded an improvement in response rate and reduced the risk of disease progression (PFS) by about 50%. No improvement in overall survival was observed. Two subsequent placebo controlled phase III studies with different chemotherapy regimens (AVADO and RIBBON-1) also demonstrated improvements in response rates but with more modest improvements in PFS and again no improvement in overall survival. As a consequence of theses findings, the Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted against an extension of the accelerated of approval for bevacizumab (Avastin) in breast cancer and indeed, voted to remove metastatic breast cancer from the Avastin label. The deliberations of the US Food and Drug administration are currently awaited. Trials of VEGF TKIs have been disappointing. While sorfenib increased PFS when added to capecitabine, trials with sunitinib have demonstrated no benefit or trials were abandoned early because of a likely negative outcome. Studies examining the role of bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting have either completed recruitment (BEATRICE) or are ongoing (E5103 and BETH). Clearly the results of these studies are awaited with interest but the negative result of the adjuvant colorectal study (C08), questions our understanding of micro-metastatic disease and its dependence on VEGF. When considering dynamic imaging studies and aspects of the clinical trial data, it is clear that modulation of tumour vasculature by VEGF inhibition has profound, potentially beneficial effects in terms of tumour control. It is incumbent on the research community to increase our understanding of how these agents may be better targeted to those most likely to benefit, either in terms of clinical characteristics or molecular predictors of response. Similarly, our understanding of the VEGF dependency of micro-metastatic disease must be better understood to design relevant clinical trials in the adjuvant setting.",

            "text": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP) is an enzyme that promotes DNA single-strand break repair, functioning as a single-strand break sensor that facilitates break repair. Single-strand break repair is required to repair the DNA damage of multiple chemotherapy drugs, and ionizing radiation, and multiple chemical inhibitors of PARP were developed initially as chemotherapy and radiation sensitizers. The clinical development of PARP inhibitors for this indication as anticancer agents was proceeding cautiously with concerns over toxicity, with uncertainty as to whether this approach would increase the therapeutic window. This all changed with the identification that cancers with defective DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination (HR) were intrinsically sensitive to PARP inhibitors. This sensitivity, often termed synthetic lethality, reflected the observation that cells with normal DNA repair pathways were not intrinsically sensitive to PARP inhibitors given as single agents, as the other DNA repair pathways, in particular HR, were able to compensate for impaired single-strand break repair. However, if cells were deficient in HR they were unable to compensate for PARP inhibitor-induced DNA damage, and cells became highly sensitive to PARP inhibitors. The tumor suppressor proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 are both required for HR, and consequently cell lines deficient in these proteins are highly sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Crucially, PARP inhibitors through synthetic lethality targeting of deficient DNA repair targeted only the cancer cells, establishing a substantial therapeutic window. The demonstration that breast and ovarian cancers arising in women with germ-line mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are highly sensitive to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, with minimal toxicity, have brought PARP inhibitors to the forefront of cancer research. 3 Although germ-line mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account only for 1% to 2% of breast cancers, there are potentially multiple ways in which HR may be lost somatically in cancers. In breast cancer, BRCA1 promoter methylation occurs in 10% to 15% of cancers and results in loss of BRCA1 expression. BRCA1 expression is also suppressed commonly in the basal-like subtype of breast cancers. The suppression of BRCA1 in basal-like cancers may potentially explain the sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancers (of which 80% are basal-like) to the combination of the PARP inhibitor BSI201 in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin. Recently it has also been shown that in vitro the phosphatase PTEN has unexpected nuclear roles and is required for normal HR. This potentially opens up PARP inhibitors to cancer with loss of PTEN through homozygous deletion or mutation. Uncertainty exists over whether PARP inhibitors are best used as single agents, or in combination with chemotherapy. It is possible that the combination of PARP inhibitors with chemotherapy may maximize the potential of PARP inhibitors. Further clinical research is required to establish whether there are clinically meaningful differences between the multiple PARP inhibitors in clinical development, and establish if there is long term toxicity associated with PARP inhibition. The reputation that NICE has in many quarters is as an organisation that rations (or 'denies') access to new cancer medicines and by implication, therefore, a block to providing excellent cancer care in England and Wales. This caricature is perhaps understandable but unfair. In the eleven years since its inception it has provided a broad sweep of guidance to the National Health Service about clinically and cost effective care of cancer patients that has contributed significantly to the successful drive to improve services across the country. It has published ten cancer service guidance documents ('Improving Outcomes in Cancer') giving blueprints for how services for specific cancers should be configured and delivered. Seven clinical guidelines have been produced and four more are currently in development. Two of these (Metastatic spinal cord compression and Metastatic malignant disease of unknown primary origin) are perhaps the first time that these common but often neglected conditions have been addressed systematically by national guidelines. The appraisal of cancer drugs has been more controversial, but over 10 years of the 90 or so decisions made about individual drugs for specific indications, the great majority were positive and supportive. A number of them also recommended use but for specific patient subsets or only in research, and so a relatively small proportion did not recommend use. Because NICE appraisal guidance is associated with a 'funding direction' which ensures that the drugs must be funded and made available, this has resulted in a significant new investment in direct cancer care. There are clearly challenges for the NHS in providing many of the latest, often expensive new drugs and many of the refusals by NICE recently have been because of very high cost and limited effectiveness. But NICE has for the past two years allowed its committees greater freedom when 'End of Life' medicines are considered and the government has encouraged the companies to offer 'Patient Access' schemes which provide free or subsidised drugs for limited periods, effectively reducing the price and allowing NICE to approve them. NICE has a strong reputation within the UK and abroad for producing clear, evidence based guidance. Its decisions may sometimes be controversial but its processes are robust and transparent and engage health professionals and patients at all stages. It has made and will continue to make an important contribution to how cancer care is delivered.",

Low levels of physical activity and overweight or obesity have been associated with various types of cancer, particularly of the colorectum and postmenopausal breast (for physical activity) or the colorectum, postmenopausal breast, liver and esophagus (for obesity). Possible mechanisms include effects on inflammation, immune function, insulin-like growth factors, insulin resistance, steroid hormones, vitamin D levels, and lipid metabolism. A yet unexplored possible mechanism linking energy balance to cancer risk includes effects on DNA repair capacity. Defects in DNA repair function are clearly carcinogenic and intriguing preliminary evidence suggests that regular exercise results in an adaptive response of enhanced antioxidant defenses and DNA repair. Among cancer patients, initial clinical studies illustrate benefits of exercise training on quality of life or fatigue as well as fitness levels, strength and cachexia. Epidemiologic studies also suggest a positive influence of physical activity on prognosis, particularly for colorectal cancer patients. However, many questions remain regarding causality of the associations, interrelationships between exercise and body weight, and the most appropriate type and timing of exercise training of cancer patients for maximum benefit and minimal risk. Cancer biomarkers are defined as measurable-specific alterations of a cancer cell either on DNA, RNA, protein, or on metabolite level. Ideally, these alterations or distinct expression patterns selectively occur only in the (pre-)cancer cells of interest but not in surrounding cells and tissues. They should enable the unequivocal identification of even very few isolated (pre-)cancer cells in a tissue biopsy or any other clinical sample. The mechanistic understanding of molecular pathways leading to cell transformation and metastatic spread allowed to define candidate biomarkers based on evidence based molecular hypotheses of how a distinct cancer may occur. Prevention of cervical cancer by early detection is since the early success of the Pap-test a paradigm of successful cancer early detection and prevention programs. The Pap test,however, is hampered by important technical limitations. Recent advances in the molecular understanding of how harmless HPV-infections progress into neoplastic lesions allowed defining novel biomarkers that appear to resolve several shortcomings of the currently used early detection techniques in cervical cancer screening. Recent research allowed to definemolecular mechanisms that mediate the switch from harmless transient productive HPV-infections into potentially dangerous transforming HPV-infections. Based on shifts of the epigenetic methylation pattern of HPV-genomes in basal squamous epithelial cells overexpression of the HPV E6 and E7 genes is triggered to initiate cellular transformation.The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16 INK4a is strongly up-regulated upon deregulated expression of the viral oncogenes in epithelial stem cells of the basal and parabasal cell layers. Antibodies directed against p16 INK4a have been developed and used to highlight HPV-transformed cells in histological section, cytological samples and also for the measurement of the amount of p16 INK4a released from dissolved HPV-transformed cells collected as cervical samples. Many clinical studies have shown that this novel biomarker concept substantially improves the sensitivity and specificity of current cervical cancer screening techniques. At the conference we will discussas an example -how the elucidation of defined molecular pathways in HPV-associated cancers allows to define molecular biomarkers that are indeed specific for the neoplastic state of cells and their clinical potential clinical impact to improve future cancer early detection and prevention concepts.

And this measurement is elementary in evaluating the effectiveness of our intervention. Shifts in stage are the earliest indication of effective screening and early detection programs, evaluation of the impact of practice guidelines, and quality of care. The UICC develops the TNM cancer staging classification that is internationally acceptable, clinically relevant, and useful for cancer control efforts. The UICC TNM Prognostic Factor Project provides evidence and consensus based cancer staging classification for worldwide use. Working across the world necessitates engagement while paying attention to the expertise and published evidence. For the classification to be adopted, opinion leaders' acceptance and engagement is essential. To be relevant to clinical practice, staging must have a significant impact on cancer outcome, or selection of treatment methods.With treatment increasingly being tailored to each patient and improved outcomes, prognostic factors need continuous reevaluation. It is likely that progress will occur along at least two axes. The first is that of improved characterization of cancer biology such as genetic and molecular characteristics of individual cancers, and the second improved characterization of disease extent with improved molecular imaging probes. The knowledge of anatomic disease extent will always be required to minimize treatment exposure. Improved diagnostic methods, and especially more accurate characterization of microscopic disease extent could help define a more homogeneous grouping of patients with similar disease characteristics and tumor-related prognostic factors, for a specified disease. Knowledge of genetic or molecular factors might further add to the improved prediction of outcome and greater individualization of therapeutic interventions. However, grouping of patients into similar categories will continue to be required to assess the impact of new technology in patient assessment and new therapies on outcome. The UICC TNM Prognostic Factor Project also responds to a growing body of knowledge and growing number of new molecularly defined disease entities, new biomarkers and prognostic factors that are essential in defining treatment and outcomes, and deals with the challenges and impact on taxonomy.

            "text": "Nowadays, tumors can be profiled with a broad repertoire of techniques at virtually every molecular level. Expression profiling at mRNA level has been complemented by profiling methods for miRNAs and other non-coding RNAs. Novel breakthroughs in proteomics allow for comprehensive determination of differential proteome profiles in cancer. Finally, chip-based techniques and genome sequencing allow for genetic and epigenetic profiling to uncover predisposing and somatic alterations in cancer. The novel highthroughput sequencing methods additionally allow for expression profiling of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs at unprecedented resolution. A general feature of these profiling methods is that they commonly deliver sets of several hundreds of molecules with differential activity levels in cancer. A functional analysis of such large candidate sets is of critical importance for discerning causal from correlative alterations, because causal alterations can subsequently be used for systematic translation into novel, personalized therapeutic approaches. The concept of cancer stem cells has Excellence in Oncology profound impact on the question, which profiles might represent the most promising sources for such efforts. From this perspective, somatic mutations recovered by genome sequencing represent a favorable starting point, because these can be assumed to be largely invariant, when comparing ''bulk'' cancer cells to the cancer stem cells. Weighing the different in vitro functional genomics strategies against each other, studies of gene function by transient transfection methods rapidly reach a threshold, where they become uneconomic. By contrast, the construction of panels of stable cancer cell lines with targeted engineering of genes and genetic alterations of interest provides a permanent resource for systematic studies of relevant aspects of cancer, such as cancer growth, invasion, and drug resistance. Further, they can directly be forwarded to in vivo studies and systematic drug screens. We use synthetic biology approaches to engineer systems for the targeted genetic manipulation of cancer cells. By employing recombination-based techniques, these systems allow for the construction of isogenic, i.e. genetically identical, stable cancer cell lines with inducible or constitutive upregulation or knock-down of one or two target genes in any desired permutation. The technique allows operating at the critical scale for coming from molecular profiles to systematic functional analyses. In a prototype screen, we selected from profiling studies a set of 120 candidate genes for melanoma and constructed a panel of 120 isogenic stable cell lines. A targeted functional genomics approach delivered numerous primary hits for new modulators of cancer growth. Follow-ups so far identified one novel oncogene highly upregulated across various cancer types as well as a second promising drug target. Inactivation of the latter causes synthetic lethality selectively in cancer cells with a point mutation in a particular oncogene. This provides an example for how to translate comprehensive molecular profiles into novel conventional and personalized drug targets via systematic functional genomics. Within the Lundbeckfonden Center of Excellence Nano-CAN, these efforts are now scaled up to systematically identify new drugs with selective killing activity for cancer stem cells. In newly diagnosed glioblastoma, the landmark phase III trial by the EORTC/NCIC has defined the current standard of care. As published by Stupp et al., postoperative treatment consists of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT, total dose 60 Gy in 30 fractions) with concomitant administration of Temozolomide followed by further chemotherapy with Temozolomide. Chemotherapy might enhance the effect of radiotherapy, aiming either at additive cell kill or true radiosensitization, or treat microscopic out-of-field tumour based on the principle of spatial cooperation. Previous studies have found that local radiotherapy fields are as appropriate as whole-brain radiotherapy and that 60 Gy was better than lower doses. Further dose escalation (EBRT or brachytherapy) failed to improve survival. High-precision stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was studied in the randomised Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 93-05 trial (patient recruitment 1994-2000, i.e. before Temozolomide was available). In one arm, SRS was given (single fraction of 15-24 Gy, depending on lesion diameter, based on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging). Afterwards, EBRT (60 Gy) and carmustine was administered (the reference treatment in the other arm). SRS was not associated with significantly improved survival. Therefore, EBRT to 60 Gy is still the current standard of care. However, it is unclear whether the imaging technology used at that time truly was adequate to define the SRS target volume, given the high precision and sharp dose fall-off achieved with SRS. Postoperative changes might complicate glioma target volume delineation. Current studies evaluate, e.g., positron emission tomography with various tracers and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) might allow for better sparing of surrounding critical structures, but its true clinical benefit in this disease has not yet been adequately identified. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a prerequisite for selective dose escalation to tumour sub-volumes, which might be identified with new imaging methods. The hypothesis to be tested here is that biologically more aggressive sub-volumes can be imaged and treated selectively to higher doses. In recurrent glioblastoma, re-irradiation has emerged as therapeutic option in selected patients with adequate performance status and tumour size. SRS and FSRT have been studied, but no large-scale randomised trials are available. The RTOG 90-05 re-irradiation dose escalation trial has shown that SRS to large recurrent tumours requires considerable dose reduction. The recommended dose to targets measuring 31-40 mm was 15 Gy. FSRT might improve the therapeutic ratio in such cases. Pooled data from different studies with more than 300 patients reviewed by our group demonstrates that reirradiation yields 6-months progression-free survival of 28-39% and 1-year survival of 18-48%, without additional chemotherapy (median value 26%). Patients with Karnofsky performance status <70 appeared to be at higher risk of early progression and apparently had lesser benefit from re-irradiation. Clinical improvement was observed in 24-45% of the patients. Serious late toxicity was uncommon, especially after conventional treatment and FSRT. Even fraction sizes of 3-5 Gy appear to be well tolerated in limited-volume recurrences as long as the total dose is limited to 30-35 Gy. Anti-angiogenesis agents such as Bevacizumab might expand our therapeutic armamentarium. Their role in conjunction with SRS and FSRT has yet to be defined. Emerging data suggests that Bevacizumab might improve delayed radiation toxicity (perfusion impairment leading to necrosis). Glioblastoma is the most malignant and most common primary intrinsic brain tumor. The standard of care for patients with glioblastoma includes surgical resection whenever feasible, radiotherapy and chemotherapy using the oral alkylating agent, temozolomide. Anaplastic gliomas are differentiated into pure astrocytomas, mixed oligoastrocytomas and pure oligodendrogliomas. Surgery is an accepted standard of care for these tumors, too, but whether radiotherapy can be replaced by chemotherapy as the first-line treatment, or should be combined with chemotherapy upfront, as in glioblastoma, is currently explored in clinical trials. The DNA repair enzyme enzyme, O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), antagonizes the genotoxic effects of alkylating agents. MGMT promoter methylation predicts a Excellence in Oncology Int. J. Cancer: 128, Supplement 1, 1-29 (2011) V C 2011 UICC favorable outcome in patients with glioblastoma who are exposed to alkylating-agent chemotherapy, including temozolomide and nitrosoureas. That MGMT promoter methylation uniformly results in MGMT gene silencing and thus loss of MGMT protein expression, has remained difficult to demonstrate. Nevertheless, this biomarker of MGMT promoter methylation may in the future be used for clinical decision making at least in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. At present, it is largely used to stratify or even select glioblastoma patients for clinical trials. For instance, CENTRIC, the registration trial for the integrin antagonist, cilengitide, limits enrolment to glioblastoma patients with MGMT promoter methylation. Conversely, glioblastoma patients lacking MGMT promoter methylation, who may derive little benefit from temozolomide chemotherapy, are eligible for some European trials where novel agents are explored in the newly diagnosed setting in combination with radiotherapy alone. In other subtypes of glioma, such as anaplastic gliomas, the relevance of MGMT promoter methylation might extend beyond the prediction of chemosensitivity, and could reflect a distinct molecular profile predicting responsiveness to radiotherapy as well. A broader clinical use of this biomarker is not yet feasible because major prerequisites for standardized tests have not been met, and difficulties in reproducibility across laboratories persist. Standardization of MGMT testing requires comparison of different technologies across laboratories and prospectively validated cut-off values for prognostic or predictive effects. Future clinical trials are necessary to determine, for each subtype of glioma, the degree to which MGMT promoter methylation is predictive for response to specific treatments, or prognostic for response to genotoxic therapies in a broader sense, and whether testing should become routine clinical practice. At present, except for the repeatedly confirmed prognostic value in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, the prognostic and predictive value of MGMT promoter methylation in patients with different types of glioma treated upfront or at recurrence has remained controversial. The drug development process is slow, time consuming and the regulatory burden hampers the recruitment and completion of clinical trials. It currently takes 12 to 15 years from drug discovery until marketing, compared with an average of 8 years in the 1960s. Since 2004, with the publication of FDA Concept Paper titled ''Innovation or stagnation?'', regulatory agencies in US and Europe have recognized this problem. As a response, in 2006 new regulatory guidelines concerning early clinical trials have been issued, focusing on pharmacodynamic endpoints, and that require a lesser amount of preclinical data in animals. These are the guidelines on so-called ''Phase 0 trials'', which have no intention to treat. From a scientific and regulatory point of view therefore that the pressing need for updating clinical research been recognized. But new guidelines on clinical trials alone are not going to solve the problem. Clinical research requires also the human factor: participants. From 2000 to 2007, 40 % of CTEP-sponsored trials failed to achieve minimum accrual objectives, and delayed study activation was identified as a major culprit behind accrual failure. Not only, but currently, fewer than 5 % of eligible adult patients with cancer participate in clinical trials. From its start, the ethics of clinical research has been heavily focused on the protection of subjects. This is understandable, as all the clinical research ethical guidelines were written in the aftermath of the WWII. But, as these historical conditions do not hold anymore, and as data demonstrate that increased participation could have beneficial effects on advancing medical knowledge, the ethical foundations of clinical research should also consider the other side of the coin, namely that patients have an interest in participating in research, as they have an interest in its advancement. Several authors have argued in favor of the moral obligation to participate in research, on the basis of the arguments of fairness and reciprocity, and promotion of the public good of biomedical knowledge.",

Within this LP perspective, subjects would be ''nudged'' towards participation in research: patients who meet the criteria for enrollment and have exhausted standard treatment would be presented with the option to participate in a clinical trial. The respect for their autonomous decision would be preserved by retaining the possibility of opting out. Such a simple change in an initial condition could have striking effects in practice, as a similarly simple change in the default option in the context of organ donation shows. As Phase 0 trials do not offer any therapeutic benefit to the participant, they could represent the paradigmatic case of this shift in the ethics of clinical research, which envisages researchers and subjects as parters in the promotion of the common good of biomedical knowledge.",

            "text": "Real examples of clinical trial design from the IEO breast programme Conduction of clinical trials in Europe is approaching a state of crisis. Layers of bureaucracy at participating institutions and other government agencies slow the review process from concept to protocol approval. Some trials remain uncompleted because of poor enrollment, lack of interest, excessive administrative burdens, and inadequate funding. Current protocol initiation is plagued by inefficiencies, overlapping oversight, and lack of standardized collaboration between the research groups and industry. Many steps in the review process are redundant, and there are many oversight committees with different objectives and responsibilities. At European Institute of Oncology (IEO) we implemented strategies to improve clinical research. Specific changes have been done in several areas: 1) Speed and efficiency of the design, launch, and conduct of trials. 2) innovation in translational science and trial design. 3) Trial prioritization according to scientific strength and according to disease subpopulation, selection, support, and completion. 4) Incentives for patient and physician participation. We created a scientific steering committee (Strategic Scientific Committee) to better define the trials with the highest priority. Validated biomarkers and maintenance of tissue banks will be necessary for all the future personalized medicine studies. With many established standard-of-care therapies already in place and hundreds of potential therapies in the arena, innovative trial designs are mandatory. This is the main approach of trial design in our breast cancer program. We selected and implemented research according to innovative trial design. Real-life examples of these designs include: 1) Multigroup and multistage design. Uses intermediate outcomes and tests new agents and combinations against a single control group. 2) Adaptive trial design. Uses Bayesian analysis during trial to allow study groups to be eliminated and patients requirements to be reduced. 3) Predictive biomarker trial. Stratifies patients according to biomarker status. 4) Progression free survival (PFS) trial. 5) Randomized phase II trials. 6) Simultaneous multiagents trials. All trial are designed for subpopulation of breast cancer patients. Our program's success depends on increased participation of patients in the studies. Obstacles to physician participation include the time required, a lack of academic recognition for participation, inadequate teaching and mentoring for clinical trialists, and inadequate cost reimbursement. These factors can be addressed by involving young investigators and mentoring them for a career development program. For patients, obstacles include fear of clinical trials, variable coverage of care expenses, ignorance of trial options, complex eligibility requirements, and geographic distance from trial sites: all these potential limitations are rectified by straightforward improvements in expenses coverage and electronic tools that provide information about available trials. During the talk a specific trial we'll be presented (inflammatory breast cancer model) with results and discussion. Meta-analysis is a statistical procedure that integrates the results of several independent studies considered to be ''combinable.'' Well conducted metaanalyses allow a more objective assessment of the evidence than traditional narrative reviews, provide a more precise estimate of a treatment effect, and are useful tool to investigate between-study heterogeneity. They are used to generate hypotheses for future trials, to study the consistency of trials with similar goals, and to obtain more precise estimates of effect. The main difficulty in integrating the results from various studies regards the variability in terms of study design, methods employed and types of populations. Those who perform meta-analyses are aware of these problems and have proposed a number of guidelines to minimize their impact. First of all, a formal protocol should be written specifying the exact question under investigation and describing the studies that will be included in the analysis. Secondly, meta-analytic techniques should be used to investigate heterogeneity, validity of inclusion/exclusion criteria, and possible sources of bias, including publication bias. Thirdly, all eligible studies must be included in the meta-analysis. Data must be free of biases-such as those due to selection or exclusion criteria. In fact, if a conscious decision is made to exclude some, there is always a suspicion that this was done in order to achieve a desired result. The Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) conference published a checklist that suggest items to be included in a meta-analysis report that can systematically influence estimates of treatment effects. This initiative also acted as a catalyst for improving the methods by which meta-analyses are conducted. Fixed and random effects models are used to combine studies. The former is based on the hypothesis that the true magnitude of the effect is assumed to be a constant, the latter that the effect can vary between studies. Such analyses are becoming increasingly popular in medical research where information on efficacy of a treatment is available from a number of clinical studies. If considered separately, any one study may be either too small or too limited in order to generalize conclusions about the effect of treatment. Combining the findings across such studies represents an attractive alternative to strengthen the evidence about the treatment efficacy and investigate reasons for the variability in the results. For healthcare managers and clinicians, careful reviewing of published meta-analyses and a balanced assessment of their deficiencies is likely to become an increasingly important way of resolving therapeutic uncertainty. Cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) is a syndrome consisting of many types of cancers, and as diagnostic techniques improve patient management continues to evolve. Molecular profiling of tumors may aid in defining the primary site of origin. Several molecular assays are reasonably accurate (80-90%) in recognizing known primary cancers, and the accuracy and clinical utility of these assays in CUP classification has been the subject of recent clinical research.",

            "text": "Indirect validation studies of several assays in CUP have correlated clinical features and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining patterns, and suggest the assays are reasonably accurate (average positive correlations 85%). One study provided a direct measure of accuracy, by evaluating the initial biopsy in a select group of CUP patients who months to years later had their latent primary site discovered, thus providing a direct validation of the assay (75% accurate; 15 of 20 tumors). To further determine if molecular profiling adds to the standard pathologic evaluation in CUP, and to define the outcome in the subset of patients with a ''colorectal profile'' we completed one retrospective evaluation and continue a prospective study of the BioTheranostics RT-PCR molecular assay (Cancer TYPE ID). In the prospective evaluation 149 CUP patients had the assay successfully performed on their diagnostic biopsy, and 97% had a primary site predicted (20 different sites; intestine in 16%; non-small cell lung 11%; breast 9%; liver 6%; ovary 5%; pancreas 5%). In 59 patients, a single primary site was predicted by IHC staining, and in this group the molecular assay diagnosis was obtainable in 52, and matched the IHC prediction in 40 (77%). The correlations in breast (100%), intestinal-colorectal (93%) and lung adeno/large cell (74%) are notable. In the other 97 patients in whom IHC was consistent with 2 or 3 possible primary sites the assay matched one in only 45%. In 21 CUP patients with a colorectal diagnosis the response rate to site-specific chemotherapy were 80% and the median survival about 20 months. The retrospective study reviewed 42 patients with CUP and a ''colorectal molecular profile.'' The standard clinicopathologic features were frequently consistent with an occult colorectal primary, and 32 patients received either first or second-line regimens used for colorectal cancer; response rates were 50% and the median survival was 27 months. Molecular profiling can accurately predict the primary site of origin in a majority of CUP patients. When a single primary site is predicted by IHC staining, the correlation with the molecular profile diagnosis is good, and the molecular assay may not be necessary. In the majority of patients IHC staining is not specific and molecular profiling assays can provide additional valuable information. The impact of site-specific therapies in CUP based on molecular assay diagnosis appears promising, particularly in the colorectal subset and the selected use of these assays in concert with the clinical features and IHC stains will likely change the therapeutic approach to many CUP patients. Additional prospective studies in CUP of molecular profiling directed therapy to determine if patient outcome is improved are necessary and ongoing.",

            "text": "Carcinoma of unknown primary site: current management and treatment Carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) is a common clinical syndrome, accounting for approximately 3% of all cancer diagnoses. After metastatic cancer is documented, usually on the basis of a biopsy of a metastatic lesion, further clinical and pathologic evaluation is indicated for the purposes of: 1) identifying a primary site or tissue of origin, if possible, 2) establishing whether the patient fits into a favorable treatment subset, and 3) establishing the extent of disease and prognosis. The initial clinical evaluation includes a complete medical history, physical examination, chemistry profile, complete blood counts, urinalysis, and computed tomography scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. PET scanning also detects some occult primary tumors, although its benefit has been incompletely evaluated in this setting. All women should have mammography; men should have measurement of serum PSA. Additional evaluation should be based on clinical signs/symptoms or specific pathologic findings. Improved methods of diagnosis are the most exciting new development in the management of CUP, and will be discussed more completely in other sections of this symposium. Traditional pathologic evaluation has included an assessment of histology, followed by pertinent immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Although excellent at differentiating carcinomas from other cell lineages, the identification of specific adenocarcinomas, other than Excellence in Oncology Int. J. Cancer: 128, Supplement 1, 1-29 (2011) V C 2011 UICC prostate cancer (PSA stain) has been problematic. New IHC stains are somewhat more specific, although most still require interpretation in context of other clinical and pathologic features. In addition, molecular tumor profiling is under intense investigation currently, and will undoubtedly be of future use in establishing the tissue of origin in many of these patients. Even if no primary site is identified, some patients can be categorized into one of several treatable subsets, on the basis of clinical and/or pathologic features. Subsets include: 1) women with axillary node metastases, 2) women with peritoneal carcinomatosis, 3) young men with features of extragonadal germ cell tumor, 4) squamous carcinoma involving neck nodes, 5) squamous carcinoma involving inguinal nodes, 6) neuroendocrine carcinoma, 7) carcinoma presenting with a single metastatic lesion, 8) men with elevated serum or tumor levels of PSA, 9) patients with ''colon cancer profile''. Details of treatment in these patient subgroups will be presented. For the group of patients who do not fit in to any of the treatable subsets, a trial of empiric chemotherapy is the current treatment standard. Although no phase III randomized trials exist, several ''modern'' regimens are generally accepted to be more active than either best supportive care or older regimens. These regimens include combinations of taxane/platinum, gemcitabine/platinum, or gemcitabine/taxane. With current regimens, response rates range from 30-40% in most reported series, with median survivals of 8 to 11 months. Limited experience with targeted agents exists, and has indicated some activity with inhibitors of the VEGF and EGF pathways. However, the role of agents with these targets or others is currently undefined.",

            "text": "Treatment directed by molecular profiling results: preliminary report of a prospective study Increasing evidence supports the ability of molecular tumor profiling to correctly identify the tissue of origin in the majority of patients with CUP. However, there is little data regarding the use of these putative diagnoses to select first-line therapy for these patients. Indeed, there is skepticism that established treatments for cancers of known primary site will be effective in CUP patients, due to fundamental differences in tumor biology. However, increasing anecdotal data, in addition to the retrospective data in patients with ''colon cancer profile'', suggests that at least a portion of patients with CUP will respond to treatment in a predictable way. In 2008, we began a prospective trial to evaluate the use of a molecular assay (CancerTYPE ID; BioTheranostics, Inc.) in identifying the tissue of origin and directing first-line treatment for patients with CUP. Patients with the diagnosis of CUP and formalin-fixed biopsy tumor specimens available were eligible. Patients with specific treatable subsets of CUP were excluded. Patients who were given a specific tissue of origin by the Cancer-Type ID assay were treated with standard treated regimens for that particular type of cancer, while those without a specific tissue of origin were treated with an empiric CUP regimen. To date, 110 patients have enrolled and have had the molecular profiling assay performed; 98 patients had specific diagnoses rendered, and 66 patients (60% of the total) received assay-directed therapy. The assay was unsuccessful due to inadequate tissue in 12 patients (11%); the remaining patients did not receive assay-directed therapy for other reasons (eg. rapidly declining performance status, refusal of assay-directed therapy, treatment considered urgent and initiated prior to assay result). Of the patients who received assay-directed therapy, 61 had specific primary sites identified, while 5 had molecular profiles that were non-diagnostic. Eighteen different primary sites were identified by the assay; most common groups included pancreas (11 patients), colorectal (8), urinary bladder (8), non-small cell lung cancer (5) , and ovary (4). Patient subsets are currently relatively small to evaluate separately for treatment efficacy. Of the 8 patients with colorectal cancer profiles, all received FOLFOX/bevacizumab; 6 of 8 patients had partial responses or stable disease for greater than six months. The median overall survival for the entire group of patients was 12.9 months. The study is ongoing, with the goal of treating sufficient patients in the common subsets to be able to make a more definitive statement regarding the efficacy of site-specific therapy.",

In CUP, the regression or dormancy of the primary tumor, the development of early, uncommon, systemic metastases, and the resistance to therapy are hallmarks of this heterogeneous clinical entity. Still, no consensus exists on whether CUP is simply a group of metastatic tumors with unidentified primaries or a distinct entity with specific genetic/phenotypic aberrations that define it as ''primary metastatic disease.'' Karyotypic analyses as well as single-gene, single-protein studies done on the expression of oncogenes, tumor-or metastasis-suppressor genes, as well as angiogenesis effectors did not identify a molecular aberration that is specific for CUP rather than metastatic malignancies. These studies showed frequent expression of oncoproteins, lack of activating epidermal growth factor receptor/c-Kit mutations or amplification, uncommon presence of tumor-or metastasis-suppressor gene mutations and highly active angiogenesis in CUP. Informative as they may be, these data have been observed in several solid tumors of known primary and failed to identify a CUP-specific molecular signature. The latter, if it exists, probably consists of a multigene expression pattern not captured by single-gene studies. Gene and protein microarray technologies offer promise for the unraveling of complex genetic programs that would either identify each CUP's primary tissue of origin or instead define the CUP-specific molecular signature. Confirmation of one of the two hypotheses would either improve primary disease-oriented therapy or develop CUP-oriented treatments targeting molecular aberrations that drive neoplastic growth/dissemination.

Over the last decade there has been an increased availability of sophisticated diagnostics including newer imaging and immuhistochemistry (IHC) options and more recently molecular profiling techniques, although innovative therapeutic interventions have lagged. Traditionally, patients with CUP have been treated with empiric chemotherapy doublets. There are at least two potential approaches that can be used to define CUP subsets and improve on therapy options for our patients. In the ''targetbased'' approach, all CUP tumors may be evaluated for over expression of molecular markers such as EGFR mutations, Her-2, Kras and others. It has not yet been established that this approach will benefit CUP patients given the variable correlation between marker over expression and therapeutic response although additional insight into novel targets that drive CUP biology may allow us to consider appropriate tests. The alternative ''site-of-origin'' approach attempts to use IHC or gene expression studies to help identify CUP subsets with molecular profiles consistent with putative site of origin. This approach could potentially leverage the substantial development work focused on site-specific tumors. Our recent experience with this latter approach has been encouraging. In the last few years, we have come to recognize a new 'favorable' CUP subset in association with a colon-cancer profile (CCP-CUP). Recognizing this group of patients is important with apparent therapeutic implications. Unlike most favorable CUP cancers which are based on anatomical distribution and histopathology, CCP-CUP may be best identified by pathologic evaluation including IHC and molecular profiling. By definition, these patients have a negative colonoscopy. Our retrospective and prospective studies suggest that patients with CCP-CUP have immunohistochemical features, molecular profile, clinical presentation and course that resemble colon or appendiceal carcinoma. CCP-CUP is identified by CK 20 and CDX2 positive and (often, though not always) CK 7 negative IHC, and a molecular profile that is consistent with the profile of patients known to have metastatic colon cancer. Our early work suggests that these patients show substantial benefit from the use of specific therapeutic approaches developed for patients with metastatic colorectal tumors. There are limitations to IHC as have been described in known colorectal cancers including a decreased or even absent CK 20 expression as reported in microsatellite high (MSI-H) colon tumors and poorly differentiated tumors. We are also beginning to recognize the limitations of profiling assays. Our best approach is to present an integrated cost and clinically effective algorithm based on IHC and profiling so that they complement each other to provide our CCP-CUP patients with the best management options.",

Having moved from a 5FU only world and a median survival of 10-12 months to having 7 approved agents (in the US) and overall survivals reaching nearly 3 years, we are claiming great success. Indeed we should be pleased but we must recognize that we have not yet cured the disease, and we still use the ''trial and error'' method of treating patients. In essence, our treatment strategy is to give all the patients all the drugs, knowing that each treatment will only help a subset of patients. However, we are just entering the next revolution, and one that will realize the true benefit of targeted therapy. Centered around mutations in the EGFR pathway, we now recognize which subset of patients will NOT respond to the EGFR agents. This information results in only positive outcomes for patients: those who receive the drugs have a much greater chance of benefit and we no longer give these drugs to patients who will not benefit from them saving them time and toxicity. This new revolution will also be the key to the rapid, successful development of the next generation of cancer agents being tested today. Importantly, we must re-analyze the tools we currently utilize. Prime among them is the tumor sample, but newer data suggests that unless we control the conditions of tumor collection, we will not have accurate results. The concept of ischemia time will be briefly explored. This overview represents only a small fraction of novel approaches being investigated for the treatment of colon cancer. With the successes targeting EGFR and VEGF pathways, with our increasing comprehension of the need for personalized medicine (not all treatments are for all patients), we will increase our dependence on tumor tissue, on measuring specific pathways, of determining which pathways our tumors are dependent upon (oncogene addiction). When asked what are the most promising future targets and agents, I actually answer they all will play a key role once we find the right patients to treat. The future is bright but highly challenging. New trial designs will be required. Cooperation among competitors will be required. Our goal should be returned to curing cancer, not merely prolonging survival by a few months. Cure is the expectation of our patients and society, and we should do our best to meet this goal. Cancer is a global problem but likely has local genetics. We recognize that gastric cancers vary around the world, but is the same true for colon cancer? Do the results of trials performed in on area of the world accurately reflect results in other regions. ",

PARSPORT investigated the role of IMRT in reducing xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer. Methods: The PARSPORT trial compared two radiotherapy delivery methods in the treatment of patients with pharyngeal tumours (T1-4, N0-3, M0). Patients received 65Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks delivered using either CT planned parallel opposed lateral fields or parotid-sparing IMRT. Stratification was by site of tumour and centre. The primary endpoint was incidence of LENT-SOMA !G2 xerostomia one year after treatment. Secondary endpoints included acute toxicities (CTCAE v3) and other late RTOG and LENT-SOMA radiation toxicities. Saliva collection was attempted from both parotid glands. Proportions of patients with !G2 toxicity were compared using exact tests. For secondary endpoints a significance level of 1% was used. . Corresponding values at 24 months were 83% (20/24) and 29% (9/31) (p<0.001). On the RTOG scale, 12 month !G2 xerostomia was reported in 65% (22/34) RT vs 39% (15/39) IMRT patients (p \u00bc 0.04). The 24 month incidence was 75% 18/24 RT vs 19% (6/32) IMRT (p<0.001). Acute radiotherapy related !G2 fatigue was more prevalent in the IMRT group (65% vs 40% p \u00bc 0.02). No differences in acute mucositis or pain scores were seen. At 12 months, no statistically significant differences were seen in other late toxicities. No differences in overall survival or locoregional control rates were observed. Conclusions: Sparing the salivary glands through use of IMRT preserves salivary flow and significantly reduces the incidence of xerostomia in patients with pharyngeal tumours. ",

            "text": "Progress in the management and outcome of patients with rectal cancer has been an endeavour across disciplines over the past decades. Obviously, success has derived from building on bricks of information and puzzling together the pieces of scientific progress one after another. However, some major leaps in understanding principles of disease have been made by a few owing to the works of many. A retrospective view of papers published in the British Journal of Surgery over the past half century may identify studies that have been deemed particularly valuable in the management of rectal cancer. Further, the evolvement of the studies published in a high-ranked surgical journal over time, reveals that not only has understanding of the disease evolved but also the scientific approach to investigation has developed. According to the Web of Science, papers on rectal cancer in the major general surgical journals were scarce prior to the early 1980s. However, over the past decades there has been an almost exponential increase in papers covering this topic with BJS taking a definite lead in terms of number of papers published (>500 articles), total times cited (>15,000 citations), average citations per article (>30 per article per year) and the accumulated average citations per year for the topic (>260) in addition to having the most cited paper among the surgical journals for the topic (Heald et al. The mesorectum in rectal cancer surgery -the clue to pelvic recurrence? Br J Surg, 1982). Following the introduction of the principles of total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer, the 1990s reported a number of landmark studies demonstrating the survival effect of training and implementing this uniform surgical technique as well as hospital and surgeon volume on patient survival. Then, during the later part of the 1990s and early 2000s, papers investigating prognostic factors followed, including defining the circumferential resection margin and the role and timing of pre-and post-operative adjuvant chemoradiation. Later came the definition of high-resolution MRI of the rectum to allow for preoperative identification of important surgical and pathological prognostic risk factors for better selection and assessment of patients undergoing preoperative therapy. The past decade has seen trials comparing laparoscopic vs open technique, and investigated bladder and sexual (dys)function after mesorectal excision. Over time, there is ample evidence that surgical science has evolved from single-center retrospective observational studies, to reports from national registries to prospective, multicenter studies and randomized clinical trials. With continued clinical investigation and refined research questions new milestones papers will appear in the management of rectal cancer and most likely an important share of them will be published in the BJS. This talk will illuminate some of the milestones made in rectal cancer over the past decades as envisioned by a presentation of selected papers published in the BJS. ",

This is the case for 5-fluorouracil and some oral fluoropyrimidines, such as capecitabine or S1, doxorubicin or epirubicin, cisplatin and oxaliplatin, docetaxel, irinnotecan and more recently the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab. However, among those agents only cisplatin, docetaxel and trastuzumab have shown to be better than other therapies in trials designed for a superiority endpoint. On the other hand, oxaliplatin and capecitabine have been found to be acceptable agents in noninferiority trials or in meta-analyses. The role of anthracyclines is largely debatable. Trials using them as single agents showed low responses and most of them were published during the eighties, when response assessment was mostly performed by WHO criteria, accepting the use of liver ultrasonography, as a tool. Data from the meta-analysis published by Wagner et al, suggests a significant survival benefit when anthracyclines were added to other combination schedules. However, this metaanalysis is not based upon individual data from patients included in those trials. Despite this, epirubicin has been used in the ECF regimen, giving consistent and reproducible results over several randomised trials, including more than thousand patients at Royal Marsden. Nevertheless, the specific value of the addition of epirubicin is difficult to assess with the currently available information.",

The combination of a platinum agent, cisplatin or oxaliplatin plus 5FU or capecitabine could be considered as an accepted practice.

DCF, ECF, or its variants ECX or EOX could be acceptable as standard comparators when designing phase III randomised studies. In our current practice, a significant proportion of patients with advanced gastric cancer do progress after first line chemotherapy with a good performance status. A German randomized trial with a limited number of patients showed that second line chemotherapy with Irinotecan could improve survival over supportive care alone. This trial supports the use of second line chemotherapy in good performance status individuals. Schedules using FOL-FIRI or docetaxel combinations are more commonly employed and could prolong disease control in advanced gastric cancer patients.",

Both therapies, especially IL-2, are associated with considerable toxicity, while only a minority of patients will experience long-term benefit from this approach. Specifically for IL-2, it has been long established that 5% of patients will achieve complete response and this is usually maintained for many years, rendering some of these patients cured from their disease. These patients are those who have undergone nephrectomy and have low volume lung metastases. The excellent outcome of these patients makes treatment with IL-2, for those who can tolerate it, still a reasonable option as initial management. Experience with IFNa is wider due to its more favorable toxicity profile. Patients who belong to the low risk group according to the MSKCC stratification have a median survival of around 3 years but cure is not achievable with IFNa. Since novel therapies can achieve superior results compared to IFNa even in the favorable prognosis group, this agent is not now considered a standard for this disease. The treatment paradigm in advanced RCC has been changing in the last 5 years. The understanding of the importance of angiogenesis both in carcinogenesis as well as the progression of renal cancer has led to the development of targeted therapies against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor. These drugs act via either direct inhibition of circulating VEGF (Bevacizumab) or by inhibiting multiple tyrosine kinases including those of the receptor of VEGF and of other angiogenic factors (sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib). In addition, inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (temsirolimus, everolimus), which indirectly stimulates angiogenesis, have also shown activity in certain groups of patients with advanced RCC. The role of immunotherapy is, therefore, being re-evaluated within the context of changing standards in advanced RCC. Currently, the combination of immunotherapy with targeted therapies appears as the most promising strategy of incorporation of immunotherapy in the contemporary treatment guidelines. IFNa is used in combination with Bevacizumab as first-line treatment, following the results of two randomized studies, which showed significant prolongation of PFS compared to IFNa alone.",

However, the degree of primary tumour shrinkage and the rate of surgically relevant down-staging seen with the current generation of agents is not sufficiently high to justify their regular use.

Active surveillance is not a perfect strategy, but the current literature indicates that upwards of 70% of men with early, low-grade disease can be managed with surveillance, provided they are willing to undergo repeat evaluations, and delayed therapy for evidence of increased risk. For men with higher volume tumors, or any intermediate to high grade findings, the patient should be counseled regarding standard curative therapies (surgery and radiation) and the possibility of alternative treatments (cryotherapy, high-frequency ultrasound, etc.). Comparison of surgery and radiation can be done using American Urological Association and/or European Association of Urology guidelines that offer state-of-the Art reviews of levels of evidence, and point by point review of oncological and functional outcomes.

            "text": "Conclusion. There is no question anymore that screening reduces prostate cancer mortality. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment can be decreased by screening less aggressively and more selectively. Well-informed men who wish to undergo early diagnosis cannot be refused. The introduction of population screening as a health policy will depend on improving on the down sides of screening, mainly on the reduction of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The cumulative body of evidence from multiple randomized trials of IP vs IV studies indicates that the average effect of IP therapy is to reduce the death rate by approximately 20%. This is the conclusion from an NCI overview of IP therapy, and from a Cochrane overview. While most, but not all of these studies also showed increased toxicity and decreased quality of life during treatment, these measures largely equalize after treatment is complete. IP therapy in GOG 172 produced the longest survival reported to date from a randomized phase III trial in advanced ovarian cancer. Yet this therapy has not gained widespread acceptance. Some have argued that the benefits of treatment given in GOG 172 are due to the differences in the dose intensity of the regimen. The IP regimen was designed to provide an intensive therapy that cannot be delivered IV thus the argument that different doses of agents were used on the IV and IP arms is a circuitous argument; the ability to give higher and more frequent dosing when using the IP route is one of the benefits of IP therapy and this dose-intensity/dose-density cannot be delivered using the IV route. While toxicities were greater on the IP arm, there was no increase in toxic deaths and quality of life measures were similar between the IV and IP arms one year after therapy was complete. Less toxic therapies are indeed preferable when clinical outcomes are equal however the benefit seen with IP therapy in GOG 172 is an important advance, not equivalence. More recent studies have shown that with contemporary supportive care measures and an experienced and dedicated treatment team, the ma-jority of patients can complete IP therapy. Furthermore, modifications of the IP chemotherapy regimen, significantly improve tolerability and ease of administration. Critics have also suggested that there are only two possible explanations for the improvement in overall survival are that patients who relapse after IP therapy live longer because the nature of the treatment has altered the biology of their disease or that they are able to receive more effective 2nd-line treatment. A treatment that provides either or both of these beneficial outcomes is desirable. However, there are two additional potential explanations for the improved survival. One is that patients who relapse later are more likely to be sensitive to second line treatment and that some patients who would have relapsed after IV therapy are prevented from relapsing (i.e. are cured) by the use of IP therapy.",

            "text": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most chemosensitive solid malignancies and more than 75% of advanced tumours will respond to platinum-based chemotherapy. More than 50 % of patients with widespread disease can expect to be in a complete clinical remission following surgery and chemotherapy, usually with carboplatin and paclitaxel. This regimen has remained the standard of care for more than a decade despite attempts to improve outcome by adding in a third or fourth agent. The duration of remission with any of these regimens remains remarkably constant, with a median progression-free survival rate of 18 months. Residual microscopic disease, resistant to these drugs is the key issue affecting the long-term survival of ovarian cancer patients in remission. Maintenance therapies have been investigated in an attempt to eradicate residual disease, or suppress its growth. The first question addressed was whether chemotherapy given for longer would extend survival. Randomised trials with maintenance or consolidation courses paclitaxel or topotecan have produced mixed results. Long-term paclitaxel has been shown to prolong progression-free survival but the results need to be interpreted in the context of overall survival. Nevertheless, new ongoing trials are investigating less toxic taxane analogues. An alternative strategy is to use a novel molecular targeting drug to consolidate remission. A randomised phase II evaluation design has been developed to 'screen' several agents that might be useful for largerscale studies. One of these drugs, BIBF 1120, a triple angiokinase inhibitor has been identified as an active compound in ovarian cancer and a trial is now being performed using this drug in first-line therapy in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and as maintenance therapy. Anti-angiogenic drugs appear to be the most promising group of agents in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis is plays a key role in the growth and progression of ovarian cancer. Non-randomised studies with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting circulating VEGF have shown good single agent activity in recurrent drug-resistant ovarian cancer and prolongation of the progression-free survival. Two large-scale international studies of chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab followed by maintenance therapy with this antibody have been completed. The first, GOG 218, presented at ASCO 2010 showed a significant prolongation in progression-free survival in patients receiving up to 15 months of therapy with bevacizumab. The results of a similar study, ICON 7 will be presented in Autumn 2010, and the results will be available for discussion. A third trial of maintenance therapy with pazopanib, a small molecule multikinase inhibitor following carboplatin and paclitaxel has completed recruitment but the results are not yet available. A further study, ICON 6 with cediranib, a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor is being performed in platinumsensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. The results of GOG 218 have clearly demonstrated the importance of anti-angiogenic therapy in ovarian cancer and indicated maintenance therapy is likely to be the best strategy. However, critical interpretation of the results is needed in order to understand how to use anti-angiogenic therapy most effectively to improve the outcome of ovarian cancer. Over the past 20 years, several phase III trials have been conducted to compare iv chemotherapy with combined iv-IP administration as first-line treatment in patients with minimal residual disease after initial surgery. The 3 largest ones run in the US confirmed the superiority for regimens including IP delivery of chemotherapy. A systematic review of these trials including more than 1800 patients has been performed by the Cochrane Collaboration, showing that women receiving intraperitoneal chemotherapy experience a significant reduction in the risk of progression and death (HR, 0.79 and 0.80 respectively). However, despite the magnitude of survival improvement, IP treatment is rarely part of standard first-line therapy in routine practice. Why? Part of the scepticism is related to the fact that in most trials the control arm at the time of the study conduction was no longer the standard of care at the time of putting the results into the routine daily practice. Moreover, the positive results of these IP trials have been exceedingly publicized, including a NCI clinical announcement, in view of the magnitude of the benefit observed. For instance, the benefit in PFS of the IP arm compared to the iv of the GOG172, the last published IP trial, is borderline significant (p \u00bc 0.05).",

In the GOG 172 trial, nearly half of the patients were unable to complete more than 3 cycles of the whole program of IP therapy. Temptation exists to modify the design of the IP regimens previously described in order to overcome their toxicity such as the use of carboplatin instead of cisplatinum or alteration of dose and schedule of the drugs.

            "text": "Traditionally maintenance treatment in oncology refers to the continuation of systemic therapy in patients who have responded to remission induction with the aim prolonging the remission. Within this broad definition there are at least 2 scenarios with quite different implications concerning the mechanism of action of maintenance therapy. In the first scenario an agent (or agents) that has been used in induction, and hence presumed to have contributed to the response, is continued in the hope that the tumour retains sensitivity to it. In the second scenario an agent not used in remission induction is commenced on completion of first-line induction therapy in the hope that exposing the tumour to a different agent (or agents) will prolong the remission perhaps through non-cross resistance. This scenario might be called early second line therapy. This distinction is important because patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can deteriorate rapidly from the cancer itself or from comorbidities that prevent them from ever receiving further therapy. So one might anticipate benefit from the early administration of 2 nd line therapy during remission as 'maintenance' rather than waiting for progression. Support for this hypothesis comes from data showing that only around 50% or fewer of patients in clinical trials ever receive 2 nd line therapy. Furthermore a trial comparing immediate with delayed 2 nd line docetaxel did report some benefits from the immediate use of the drug. Until recently the weight of evidence has supported discontinuation of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC after 4-6 cycles of induction therapy. Additionally it is only in recent years that agents without serious cumulative toxicity have become available as realistic maintenance agents. Discontinuing after induction allows patients with limited life expectancy a 'treatment holiday'. However, here has been renewed interest in the concept of maintenance from trials with pemetrexed and erlotinib. Both these agents can be given for long periods without serious cumulative toxicity in most patients. Both trials have shown significant extension of progression free survival in placebo controlled trials. In the case of pemetrexed a statistically significant 5-month prolongation of overall survival in non-squamous NSCLC has been reported in cases not receiving pemetrexed as induction therapy. Treatment was well tolerated. This effect may reflect the early administration of an active second line agent and it remains to be seen whether similar benefits will accrue to patients having pemetrexed as induction therapy. A trial is currently underway testing this. Finally, retrospective analysis of both trials testing maintenance erlotinib and pemetrexed demonstrated that the benefit accrued only to those cases who had stable disease after induction, and not to those achieving partial or complete remission. This apparently counter-intuitive observation needs testing prospectively, and explaining biologically as we learn more about the role of maintenance therapy in advanced NSCLC. Non-Small Cell lung Cancer mostly includes squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. These three subtypes represent 85% of lung tumors, the leading cause of death from cancer in the world. Median age at diagnosis is 69 years in the Western countries. More than two third of patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease and around 50% of those with an initially limited disease will eventually fail distantly. So the vast majority of NSCLC patients will be potential candidates for a palliative, systemic treatment during the course of their disease. The individual databased meta-analysis published in 1995 established the superiority of chemotherapy over supportive care in patients with advanced NSCLC. These results have been recently updated and confirmed in 2714 patients from 16 trials with an overall survival benefit of 9% at 1 year. Chemotherapy also improves quality of life and controls symptoms in patients with good performance status. It is classically recommended to use platin compouds in combination with third generation agents including vinorelbine, gemcitabine, taxanes or pemetrexed (in non-squamous NSCLC). Integrating palliative care at an early stage of the treatment also prolongs survival and improves quality of life. The addition of antiangiogenic monoclonal antibodies (bevacizumab) or antiEGFR monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab) to standard platin based chemotherapy may prolong survival in some cases but the selection of patients remains unclear and we have presently no predictive test to guide our therapeutic decision. Second line chemotherapy with docetaxel or pemetrexed has also been showed active even if the benefit on overall survival remains modest. The use of biological markers such as ERCC1, RRM1, beta-tubulin or thymidilate synthase has not yet proven efficacy on the choice of cytotoxic agents. The addition of targeted TKIs to standard chemotherapy is disappointing and has never showed superiority tover chemotherapy alone in the general population. In the recent years, several targets have been identified, particularly among the growing population of adenocarcinoma. Several targeted agents have been developed in second line (as single agents or in combination with other specific drugs); In a large chemonaive population, it has been demonstrated that, in patients with mutations of Exons 19-21, the use of first line EGFR TKIs offered a better outcome compared to a classical cytotoxic chemotherapy. More recently, it has been reported that inhibition of c-Met and ALK might also have an impact on survival of some selected patients with adenocarcinoma.",

In light of published evidence, surgery for small cell lung cancer is not an established treatment modality. Current surgical series however report excellent survival. In selected patients with small-cell lung cancer at the Royal Brompton Hospital was associated with a 5-year disease free survival of 52%. 5 Similar results have been achieved with multimodality treatment that included surgery by Eberhardt et al with 5 year overall survival of 63% 6 and a 5-year survival of 39% by the Toronto group. 7 however there is no available evidence on the prognosis of a similar group of patients treated with the current standard of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. 8 In view of the current data, surgery should feature more prominently as part of multimodality management, and British Guidelines will be advocating a broader remit for the consideration of surgery in patients with small cell lung cancer. 9",

The main improvements in outcomes have been related to use of radiotherapy, though chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for the majority of patients. A platinum-based chemotherapy regimen is the standard of care, based on the data from 4 meta-analyses and systematic reviews. However, a recent Cochrane review of 29 randomised controlled trials reported no significant survival benefit for platinum based treatment at 6, 12 or 24 months. It is unclear whether cisplatin and carboplatin can be used interchangeably, and the only study to address this was not powered for equivalence. Combined modality treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and early concurrent radiotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with limited stage disease, based on a number of randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews. Any new drug would almost certainly need to be deliverable with concurrent radiotherapy to make a significant impact in limited stage disease The role of maintenance chemotherapy remains unclear, with concerns about toxicity. With some exceptions, the field of lung cancer pathology has been relatively static over the past several decades with few major practice-changing advances. The diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on small biopsies and/or cytology, an area of lung cancer diagnosis where a paradigm shift has occurred for both pathologists and clinicians. This topic is important because the majority patients with lung cancer present with unresectable disease and the diagnosis is established based on such small specimens. Moreover, with increasing use of minimally invasive biopsy methods, pathologists are being asked to do more with less tissue. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifications of lung tumors through the 1999 edition 1,2 did not address lung cancer diagnosis based on small biopsies and cytology, as these were recommendations for the histologic classifications of resection specimens. In the 2004 WHO classification, cytology was addressed for the first time, but classification in small biopsies was not. 1 There is currently no internationally recognized standard of criteria or terminology for the diagnosis of lung cancer in small biopsies. The most important decision for pathologists in small biopsies and cytology, historically, has been the crucial distinction between small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and NSCLC, as it defines patients with completely different clinical tumor behavior and management. Within NSCLC, important clinical reasons to separate squamous cell carcinoma from adenocarcinoma and other histologic types have not existed. In a literature review spanning 25 years of clinical studies evaluating chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, there was some weak association between histology and therapeutic outcomes, 3 but none of these studies reported a formal test of treatment by histology interaction. Therefore, in older studies, there was no clear evidence that histology had a prognostic (independent of treatment) or a predictive role (associated with the effectiveness of a specific treatment) for patients with NSCLC.",

In this new classification, presents an algorithm with recommended terminology, special stains and approaches to tissue management. 10 More than 80% of the 213,000 incidental cases of lung cancer in the US are of the non-small cell variant (NSCLC) and approximately 37% of these will present at diagnosis with locoregional involvement [1] . The latter means that the tumor has spread out of the confinements of the lung into the surrounding structures without clinical evidence of dissemination. This extension varies from tumors locally abutting the chest wall, diaphragm or mediastinum (T3) to frank invasion of the mediastinal tissues and organs (T4), and nodal invasion in either the ipsilateral lymph nodes (N2) or the supraclavicular or contralateral mediastinal lymphnodes (N3) [2] . Although some of these extensions are no formal barrier for radical surgery (e.g. T3N0/1)-preferably followed by adjuvant chemotherapy-, most T4 lesions and clinical mediastinal lymph node invasion are considered beyond the limits of immediate surgery. They are referred to as stage III NSCLC and subclassified in IIIA whenever N2 nodes are involved (or T3N1 tumors) or IIIB whenever any N3 or T4 involvement is present. The surgical-radiological correlation of the mediastinal lymphnodes has been recently described [3] . The overall five year survival rate for locally advanced lung cancer is 16% [1] . In the past decade, meta-analyses have gradually shifted the standard of care in selected patients with stage III NSCLC from radical local treatment only, over sequentially administered systemic and locoregional treatments to the present concurrent chemoradiotherapy [4, 5] . The role of surgery as local treatment following induction chemo(radio-)therapy in stage IIIA-N2 has recently been challenged by 2 large randomized trials, showing no no statistically significant improvement in overall survival as compared to definitive radiation therapy (RT) [6, 7] . The role of surgery, if any, in stage III with clinical nodal involvement is hence to be considered limited [8, 9] . Present day survival figures for selected patients with stage III NSCLC treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy average a median of 17 months and a 3 year rate of 25%, versus 14 months and 18% with a sequential approach. Factors predictive of outcome are performance status, stage (IIIA/ B), weight loss and pathological downstaging of the mediastinum and/or the tumor with induction treatment. Relaps pattern typically shows that both modalities do not completely control the tumor in 80% of patients, with equal numbers of patients failing intrathoracally, extrathoracally and both [10] . Improvements in combined modality outcome should hence come from improvements in local and systemic therapies. Successful interventions to increase local control with RT include dose escalation, altered fractionation and the integration with concurrent chemotherapy [11] . These interventions increase the tumor cell kill by a variety of mechanisms, inflicting more initial radiation damage, decreasing repair or counteracting the effects of cancer-cell proliferation.",

In fact, for women with lung cancer the percentage of those with no history of smoking ranges from approximately 20% in the United States to over 80% in some Asian countries. Given the overall prevalence of lung cancer this means that lung cancer in never-smokers has a higher incidence than disease entities such as cervical cancer, and mortality rates that dwarf many other malignancies. Many speculate that the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers is on the rise, though data is difficult to obtain due to a lack of cancer registries that capture smoking data and published literature is contradictory. Less contradictory is the data indicating that never-smokers constitute a higher percentage of women with lung cancer than men with lung cancer, the higher prevalence of adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell carcinoma in neversmokers with lung cancer, and that there are racial/ethnic differences with the disease with higher rates seen in Asia. Causes of lung cancer in neversmokers remain elusive and are postulated to include secondhand smoke, exhaust from vehicles, cooking fumes in poorly ventilated kitchens, radon exposure, other environmental toxins such as asbestos, and to a lesser extent genetic factors. Regardless of cause, exciting research has identified specific ''driver'' mutations in certain genes that account for approximately half of lung cancer in never-smokers. The best characterized are those of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR were developed about a decade ago and dramatic responses seen preferentially in patients without a smoking history led to the discovery of specific",

The percentage is closer to 30% in never-smokers and as high as 60% in Asian never-smokers with lung cancer. In these patients, the mutation leads to the protein being constitutively turned on, which in turn drives the lung cancer. Turning the switch off with an EGFR-TKI such as erlotinib or gefitinib leads to dramatic responses, though unfortunately resistance develops over several months to years. More recently the EML4-ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) fusion protein has been identified in <5% of lung cancer patients, but closer to 15-20% of those with no smoking history, particularly in the very young with the disease. The drug crizotinib works dramatically in this patient population, though again resistance develops over time. Other molecular differences between never-smokers with lung cancer and those with a smoking history have also been identified with ongoing research identifying more. Lung cancer in never-smokers is an important disease entity and exciting research into the molecular underpinnings of the disease has led to dramatic therapeutic advances. Hopefully these will lead to therapeutic advances for all lung cancer patients and a reduction in the stigma associated with the disease. The publication of any new TNM classification is always a major event for those clinicians and researchers involved in the study and treatment of a particular cancer. This was especially the case with the launch of the 7 th Edition of the TNM Classification for Lung Cancer(1;2), being the first revision for 12 years and the most radical for 35 years. Unfortunately the scientific rigour of the analytical process required that it broke with the convention that each new edition was retrospectively compatible with earlier editions (3) , and this will almost certainly be the case with future revisions. The collection of raw data is recommended to ''future proof'' data in the long term. Once the 7 th edition was enacted on January 1 st 2010 all new cases of lung cancer should be classified by the new edition. It has been estimated that for 1 in 6 cases this would result in a different stage being assigned compared with the 6 th edition(4). The 7 th edition is the first to incorporate carcinoid tumours into the TNM classification, and to emphasise the use of TNM in the clinical management and trial design for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). It provided pathologists with the first standardised definition of ''visceral pleural invasion'' and provided clinicians and researchers with an internationally agreed nodal map, reconciling the discrepancies between previously used maps. There are now precisely defined anatomical boundaries for each nodal station, which alongside the new map, are recognised as the recommended means of describing regional lymph node involvement for lung cancer. Such standardisation is important as the 7 th edition has established a minimum number of lymph nodes to be removed by the surgeon and examined by the pathologist when establishing the pN category of any resection case. The anatomical extent of disease, as described by the TNM classification, does not mandate treatment options but is certainly a major factor in this decision. The 7 th edition incorporates additional size cut-points, new T sub-categories and a re-classification of cases in which there are additional tumour nodules in certain locations. Some of the resulting TNM stage groupings have been upstaged and some down-staged, more closely aligning stage with prognosis. In situations in which cases that have been traditionally treated surgically have been upstaged in the 7 th edition one may wonder if these cases should now be considered for adjuvant therapy after complete resection. Where cases previously considered to be inoperable have been downstaged one may wonder if selected cases in these categories should now be considered for surgical treatment, albeit in a multi-modality setting. It is important that these suggestions are tested in appropriate clinical trials before such changes in the treatment algorithm are accepted as a new standard of care.",

The rationale behind the development of this regimen was twofold: to deliver maximally tolerable doses of IFN-a over a finite period of time and to decrease the potential to form anti-IFN antibodies through the administration of a high-dose intravenous component. This regimen has now been tested in four randomized ECOG and Intergroup trials. The first of these (E1684) was the pivotal study accepted by the FDA Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee as the basis for licensure of IFN-a-2b (Intron A) as the first effective adjuvant therapy of melanoma following resection of disease in patients with deep primary (T4, AJCC stage IIB) or regional lymph node metastatic disease (N1, AJCC stage III) disease. The first randomized trial of the high-dose IFN-a regimen, ECOG trial E1684 enrolled 287 patients between 1984 and 1990. At a median follow-up of nearly 7 years, median survival was significantly prolonged, from 2.8 to 3.8 years, and relapsefree survival from 1.0 to 1.7 years (P1 \u00bc 0.02, 0.002, respectively)for the overall trial. The toxicity of this regimen was considerable, and dose modification or delays were required in nearly two thirds of patients during the first month of treatment and again in more than half of subjects during the last 11 months of therapy. In the second Intergroup trial E1690 642 patients were accrued. This was completed in June 1995. A lack of overall survival benefit for HDI was observed despite an improvement in relapse-free survival. The lack of an overall survival benefit in E1690 generated significant controversy regarding the benefits of the HDI regimen. Data from a third trial addressing the adjuvant use of HDI for 1 year demonstrated a highly significant relapse-free survival and overall survival benefit for patients treated with IFN-a-2b over patients who had been assigned to the GMK vaccine. The current efforts of the US and international cooperative groups are to dissect the critical component of the E1684 regimen and compare this regimen with anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody.",

Chemoembolization should be considered for all HCC patients awaiting a liver transplant and whose lesion is 2 cm or larger or close to a planned surgical plane. Though not reaching statistical significance, there was a tendency towards longer survival in the treated group. The term ''image-guided tumor ablation'' is defined as the direct application of chemical or thermal therapies to a specific focal tumor (or tumors) in an attempt to achieve eradication or substantial tumor destruction. Although tumor ablation procedures can be performed at laparoscopy or surgery, most procedures are performed with a percutaneous approach. Hence, several authors refer to these procedures as ''percutaneous therapies''. The concept of image guidance is stressed in the title to highlight that image guidance is critical to the success of these therapies. Over the past 25 years, several methods for chemical or thermal tumor destruction have been developed and clinically tested. The thermal ablative therapies involved in clinical practice can be classified as either hyperthermic treatments -including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and laser ablation -or cryoablation. The thermal damage caused by heating is dependent on both the tissue temperature achieved and the duration of heating. Heating of tissue at 50 -55 C for 4-6 minutes produces irreversible cellular damage. At temperatures between 60 C and 100 C near immediate coagulation of tissue is induced, with irreversible damage to mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes of the cells. At more than 100 -110 C, tissue vaporizes and carbonizes. On the other hand, the freezing of tissue with temperatures between \u00c020 C and \u00c060 C followed by rapid thawing results in cell membrane disruption and induces cell death. For adequate destruction of tumor tissue, the entire target volume must be subjected to cytotoxic temperatures. Among these methods, RFA is currently established as the primary ablative modality at most institutions. RFA is accepted as the best therapeutic choice for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma when liver transplantation or surgical resection are not suitable options and is considered as a viable alternate to surgery for inoperable patients with limited hepatic metastatic disease, espe-cially from colorectal cancer. Recently, RFA has been demonstrated to be a safe and valuable treatment option for patients with unresectable or medically inoperable lung malignancies. Resection should remain the standard therapy for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but RFA may be better than conventional external-beam radiation for the treatment of the high-risk individual with NSCLC. Initial favorable outcomes encourage combining radiotherapy and RFA, especially for treating larger tumors. In the setting of colorectal cancer lung metastases, survival rates provided by RFA in selected patients, are substantially higher than those obtained with any chemotherapy regimens and provide indirect evidence that RFA improves survival in patients with limited lung metastatic disease. Novel non-thermal techniques for tumor ablation-including irreversible electroporation and light activated drug therapy-seem to have potential to overcome the limitations of RFA and warrant further clinical investigation. The efficacy of combination therapies, including ablation plus administration of drugeluting beads or thermal sensitive drug carriers is also currently being explored. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have emerged as effective therapies for several cancers. Recent studies in several preclinical models have shown that the Fc portion of the antibodies is critical for their anti-tumor efficacy in several settings. Engagement of Fc receptors by mAb opsonized cells leads activation of antibody dependent cytotoxicity. In prior studies, we and others have shown that FcR dependent pathways are also critical for activation of adaptive immunity. FcR mediated uptake of opsonized tumor cells leads to marked increase in cross-presentation and generation of tumor immunity by dendritic cells. The Fc receptor system is a balance of activating and inhibitory receptors. Under steady state conditions, signaling via the inhibitory receptors dominates and plays an important role in mediating immune tolerance. Alteration of this balance towards reduced inhibitory signaling leads to activation of immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), and activation of type I interferon response. This pathway has major effects on immune stimulatory properties of DCs. Balance of activating/inhibitory receptors can therefore play a role in regulating immune effects of mAb therapies. Indeed, FcR polymorphisms have been strongly linked to survival following some antibodies, such as Rituximab therapy of lymphoma. Together, the emerging data suggest that clinical efficacy of mAb therapy may be determined not only by direct effects on tumor cells, but also the nature of recruited immunologic mechanisms, which depend in a large part on the Fc portion of antibody. These considerations also provide the biologic basis for rational combinatorial therapies as well as antibody engineering to improve the efficacy of antibody therapies. Another concept with major implications for immunotherapy of cancer is the importance of self renewal pathways or stemness in cancer. We and others have recently shown that T cells targeting pathways involved in regulating stemness are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of tumor cells in culture. Preclinical studies also support targeting putative cancer stem cells in mice. The presence of spontaneous T cells response against SOX2, an embryonal stem (ES) cell gene, is a strong predictor of favorable outcome in patients with monoclonal gammopathies / myeloma. Immunity to some of the core ES genes (such as OCT4) may be much more common than previously thought and readily detected in healthy individuals. Harnessing immunity to genes important for self renewal of tumor cells may be an important requirement for eliciting durable and protective immunity with cancer vaccines.",

It is postulated by Zitvogel et al that activation of the calreticulin exposure pathway is an important mechanism of activation of the immune system after treatment with classical therapies like chemotherapy. The thought that chemotherapy in general results in a strong reduction of major components of the immune system and thereby harming the immune system ready to attack the tumor does not hold true anymore. An evolving amount of evidence is showing the opposite. Immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy might be a very effective strategy to induce long lived antigen specific memory T cells. Cisplatinum next to paclitaxel and doxorubicin, drugs often used in gynaecologic malignancies, make tumor cells more susceptible for Granzyme B dependent killing by cytotoxic T cells. Not only chemotherapy, but also radiotherapy can prime an immune response. Proof of principle has been shown in diseases like prostate and cervical cancer.",

One examples is treatment with an anti death receptor 5 monoclonal antibody (anti-DR5 mAb) in combination with E7 specific immunization which turned out to be a very promising treatment modality resulting in the highest number of E7 specific T cells if used as a combination. Next, the death receptor antibody made the tumor cells also more susceptible for CTL killing. Studies by TC Wu and others were initiated after the observation that anti-DR5 mAb primed tumor specific cell mediated immunity. Effectivity of anti-DR5 mAb treatment was further enhanced by adding agonistic antibodies for CD40 and CD137 (both costimulatory molecules). Underlying mechanisms are topics for research at this moment, it turns out that B cells and CD11c positive dendritic cells might play a role.",

            "text": "Lessons learned from localized immunotherapy The vast amount of information and novel knowledge in the field of tumor immunology has in the last years, increased the interest in defining immunotherapeutic strategies to be applied in cancer therapy. Immunotherapy is today an increasing attractive option for the treatment of cancer. Although malignancies presuppose a failure of the host responses, patients develop innate and adaptive immune response in the course of their disease. In fact measurable immune prognostic signatures can define the immunological history of cancer progression and are becoming important markers to be used in defining prognosis and establishing timing for immunotherapy intervention. Immune activation appears to begin early during tumor development and progression and can be easily boosted by vaccination. However the effect on tumors is not rapid or at least is not comparable to the timing of a chemotherapy treatment, needing more time to activate cognate multiple interactions that will ultimately lead to tumor cell killing. Moreover this type of treatment can be particularly efficacious only in the presence of minimal residual disease since a heavy tumor burden is a condition opposing strongly the type of immunological killing based on a cell-to-cell contact while it does not profit of the advantage of lymphocytes to recirculate through tissues to find their target. Uniform expression of target antigen by the cancer cells may also not be essential since the mechanism of epitope spreading has been shown to occur in both mice and humans and contribute significantly to tumor rejection. Finally it is very important to address the question of the interactions between the standard therapies (gold standard) and immunological intervention. Until now these approaches have been considered in some ways opposite. Chemotherapy was detrimental to blood cells and therefore considered as a separate option from immunotherapy. Today anti neoplastic drugs are being studied as inducers of immunological deaths, and outcomes from pure chemotherapy trials are been revised as a result of the combination of two effects, the cell chemical cytotoxicity and the consequent immune activation. Moreover surgery can be considered as an optimal and unique way to reduce tumor derived immunosuppression that is particularly relevant in gynecological cancers. For example in ovarian cancer, cytoreduction appears to exert a beneficial systemic effect by reverting immunosuppression and restoring immunological fitness in the patient. In this presentation results will be presented on the immunological microenvironment changes occurring in cancer patients during conventional therapies and vaccination and discussed in light of possible implications in designing new vaccination strategies and propose novel criteria and biomarkers for the evaluation and monitoring of immunotherapeutic clinical trials. Over past decades a number of attempts have been made to respond to cancer distress. The field has gradually moved away from the idea that distress can be sensibly equated it with psychopathology, and these days it is generally agreed that distress is a multi-factorial concept involving physical, psychological, social, and spiritual causes. But if hardpressed oncology services are to respond to distress, as the 6 th Vital Sign, then the challenge is to do so efficiently and effectively yet humanely.",

These groups examined the intelligibility, ambiguity, and potential redundancy of items, sometimes making alternative suggestions or pooling items. The resulting 46 candidate items were then sent by post to participants, asking them to endorse any items that had been ''a source of concern or distress'' during their recent treatment. This resulted in a 42-item PL. Participants: 735 mixed cancer patients who had recently finished treatment. Responses were obtained from 395 (53%) of those written to, of whom 65% were female. Results: The most frequently endorsed items were 'Fatigue, exhaustion or extreme tiredness' (70%), 'Worry, fear or anxiety' (45%), and 'Sleep problems' (38%). Some new items were commonly endorsed: 'Memory or concentration' (30%) and 'Loneliness or isolation' (15%), suggesting that these items should be routinely included in any screening PL. Discussion: If health services are to respond to cancer distress they must first be asking the right questions of their patients and, in view of patients' reluctance to volunteer their concerns, be prepared to be proactive in doing so. It is also essential that screening for distress is acceptable to patients and that the language used is easily understood by them. The screening methods presented in this paper offer a potentially efficient way of identifying and responding to cancer distress that has thus far been warmly welcomed by patients and staff alike. Recently, work has been carried out by researchers who have deployed a qualitative methodology in an attempt to gain insights into the ways in which men comprehend general aspects of cancer care. In particular, the concepts and procedures of randomisation; the ways in which men are communicated with, their reactions to and comprehension of trial procedures and reasons for accepting and declining randomisation have become an important focus of interest. Participants: While background data will be presented from work that has been carried out with men with prostate cancer and who were invited to join clinical trials, a recent qualitative study that investigated men with bladder cancer and who were invited to join a complicated randomised trial, will form the main thrust of this talk.",

However, others were shown to 'misunderstand' concepts and procedures that led to both acceptance and refusal to be randomised, casting doubt on the validity of the trial. This was not because they were incapable of understanding but because of faulty communication procedures that did not appear to match men's needs, coercion, a lack of time to make decisions and information 'overload'. Discusson: Rather than utilising a 'deficit' model of the ways in which patients comprehend concepts and procedures of clinical trials, it is important to address the ways in which men may wish to participate, not only in trials but in cancer care in general. By doing so, clinicians and other health professionals are required to be reflexive-to look at their own practices when conveying complicated messages in situations that are, in most part, entirely new to consumers of cancer care.",

J. Cancer: 128, Supplement 1, 1-29 (2011) V C 2011 UICC made since the early 1980's. Recommendations on the optimal antiemetic prophylaxis in patients submitted to chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been suggested by many groups, and the Multinational Asssociation for Supportive Care in Cancer has recently published along with the European Society fot Internal Medecine a position paper. This presentation is based on the conclusions of this paper, and will also discuss some of the questions that still need to be addressed. Defining the emetogenicity of chemotherapy agents is a framework defining antiemetic treatment guidelines. The principles for use of antiemetic drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy are the following: -use the lowest tested fully effective dose, -no schedule better than a single dose beginning before chemotherapy, -the adverse effects of these agents are comparable, -intravenous and oral formulations are equally effective and safe. To prevent acute nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy of high emetic risk (including anthracycline cyclophosphamide combinations) a 3-drug regimen including single doses of a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and [fos]aprepitant given before chemotherapy is recommended. Guidelines recommend that all patients receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy should receive antiemetics that prevent delayed nausea and vomiting. Palonosetron is superior to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists when an NK 1 receptor antagonist is not used. Therefore, to prevent acute nausea and vomiting induced by non-AC moderately emetogenic chemotherapy a combination of palonosetron plus dexamethasone is recommended as standard prophylaxis. Dexamethasone can be substituted by other corticosteroids where it is not available. If aprepitant is not available, women receiving a combination of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide should receive a combination of palonosetron plus dexamethasone.",

It is preferable to use maximally effective antiemetics as first line therapy rather than withholding more effective antiemetics for later use at the time of antiemetic failure. Rescue antiemetic treatment is done with a number of approaches including switching to a different 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist or adding other agents such as dopamine antagonists or benzodiazepines. Anticipatory nausea and vomiting is widely believed to be a learned response to chemotherapy that develops in up to 20% of patients by the fourth treatment cycle and is difficult to control by pharmacological means. Therefore, it is recommended that the best approach to the treatment of anticipatory emesis is the best possible control of acute and delayed emesis. Pain can be relieved without excessive sedation in over ninety-percent of cancer patients. The initial steps include a comprehensive patient assessment and making a ''diagnosis'' of the cause of the pain, even in patients in whom the underlying cause cannot be reversed. Patient reports of pain may reflect underlying tissue damage, but they may also reflect other sources of suffering, including emotional, psychological, spiritual and existential injuries. The ''meaning'' of the pain alters its intensity: a post-surgical pain following a curative resection is likely to be much better tolerated than a pain arising from progressive disease. Oncologists and oncology nurse practitioners must therefore address pain from all sources, collaborating with social workers, psychologists, nurses and clergy who are crucial to relieving other causes of distress that presents as or exacerbates the experience of pain. Pharmacologic agents of several classes are usually required if patients are to achieve pain relief: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, adjuvant agents specific for bone or neuropathic pain, and opioids. Opioids available to Greek physicians who obtain the required permit include: short-acting oral and intravenous morphine, oral sustained-release morphine, and transdermal sustained-release fentanyl. Because another speaker will discuss the treatment of bone pain, this presentation will review the utility and side effects of agents useful for pain caused by muscle or tissue injury, or for neuropathic pain. These agents include: NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, neuropathic adjuvant agents, and opioids. Fear of addiction can prevent cancer patients from taking the opioids they need, but in actuality, cancer patients rarely become addicted to opioids used to relieve their pain. I will discuss the distinction between addiction and physiologic tolerance and ways to encourage cancer patients to acquire the permit needed to take pain-relieving opioids despite their and their families' fears. I will also review how to (1) manage a patient in a pain crisis (using oral or intravenous morphine), (2) convert a patient whose pain is relieved by intravenous morphine to the equi-analgesic dose of oral sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl (e.g. Duragesic TM ) (and vice versa), and (3) prevent and treat common opioid-induced side effects (i.e. constipation, nausea, and sedation). Pain must also be distinguished from delirium, and many of the agents used to relieve pain also cause delirium. I will also review, therefore, the metabolic, pharmacologic, and other predisposing factors that cause delirium, the clinical presentation of hypo-and hyperactive delirium, and what can be done to reverse the delirium. Since pain can be exacerbated by anxiety and depression, I will briefly review anti-anxiety agents and anti-depressants. ",

            "text": "Overshadowed for long by the more fulminant bacterial and fungal infections, viral agents have witnessed in cancer patients increased awareness during the last decade. New approaches to diagnosis based on molecular biology methods and new antiviral therapeutical modalities have been developed. Either directly by causing end-organ damage or indirectly through facilitation of bacterial or fungal infections, viral agents contribute to increased morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Although susceptible to the same common viruses that infect the general population, but with more complications, cancer patients are prone to devastating diseases generated by several chronic or latent viral infections. There are no global epidemiological data on viral infections in cancer patients. Several studies are focused on haematological malignancies, mainly on hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). In our last review on causes of fever in cancer patients, viral causes represented 3.9 %. However, this is an under estimation since many viral infections are not documented microbiologically. The main sites of involvement include the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the central nervous system. Pneumonia is one of the most common infectious complications in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Respiratory viruses are being increasingly recognized as important pathogens and responsible for severe lower respiratory tract infections. Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and other nucleic acid sequence based amplification methods, have markedly improved our detection of respiratory viruses including the old ones such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncitial viruses (RSV), adenoviruses and the new ones such as human metapneumovirus, coronavirus and rhinoviruses. The associated mortality in cancer patients is highly variable with the highest rates reported in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Anti-influenza vaccination and contact isolation are important prevention measures. High-dose oseltamivir and IV peramivir are being evaluated for severe influenza pneumonia, and IV or oral ribavirin is increasingly used for parainfluenza, RSV, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus Viral gastro-intestinal infections are more frequent in the pediatric cancer population. Although there is no specific treatment for epidemic viral gastroenteritis caused by norovirus, rotavirus, or astrovirus, identification is important for infection control measures in order to avoid nosocomial transmission. Herpetic mucositis is very common in cancer patients and early treatment with acyclovir has almost eliminated the end-organ damage previously reported with Herpes simplex such as pneumonia or hepatitis. Ulcerative esophagitis may be uncommonly associated with herpetic mucositis and on rare occasions in highly immunosuppressed patients, cytomegalovirus could be the causative agent. Viral colitis is either due to cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus 6 or enteric adenovirus and could be either localized or part of a disseminated disease. Viral hepatitis in cancer patients is of major concern. It could be either associated to a disseminated disease due to cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, HHV6, EBV or due to reaction of hepatitis viruses A, B, C, and E. There is increasing evidence showing that carriers of hepatitis B who are candidates for chemotherapy, should receive pre-emptive therapy with lamivudine or adefovir. Viral encephalitis or meningitis in cancer patients is the most serious complication. Several viruses have been implicated including herpes virus such as Herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, CMV, HHV6 and EBV. Polyomavirus JC is responsible of progressive multifocal leuco-encephalitis, occurring in haematological malignancy patients such as LLC, Hodgkin lymphoma and post-allogeneic HSCT.",

A first progress in the management of NSCLC was the demonstration of a favourable impact of platinum or carboplatin-based therapy on survival and quality of life. Today a combination of a platinum derivative with any of the following agents : docetaxel, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine or premetrexed continues to be the standard of care for advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Another important advance has been the demonstration that adjuvant platinumbased chemotherapy prolonged survival in a significant proportion of patients with stage I, II or IIIA NSCLC who underwent a successful resection of the tumor. A recent major step to words a better management of NSCLC has been the recognition that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family played an important role in the tumorigenic process and that the EGF-receptor was frequently overexpressed in the development and progression of NSCLC. Actually somatic mutations have been identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR that predict significant responses to EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Many other genetic abnormalities (VEGF overexpression, KRAS and BRAF mutations, TITF-1 amplification, ERCC1, etc) not only provide a better understanding of NSCLC carcinogenesis but could be used as prognostic factors or targets for therapy. Hopefully, therapy of NSCLC will increasingly become more personalized, based on specific features of the tumor and of the patient. The tremendous laboratory and clinical efforts to achieve a better management of NSCLC should not however cloud that in the majority of cases, lung cancer is due to tobacco use, which makes it a self-induced and highly preventable disease.",

Although studies have shown that mRNA can be isolated from tumour cells, it has been much harder to defin-itively show the presence of EPO receptor protein due to a lack of specific antibodies against the erythropoietin receptor. It is also questionable whether the erythropoietin receptor on tumour cells is functional and although there is some in vitro evidence showing enhanced tumour growth with erythropoietin, in vivo studies are less convincing. (2) Thromboembolism is a common event in cancer patients, and a leading cause of death. Data from both the oncology, as well as the nephrology literature suggest an enhanced risk of thromboembolism with ESA therapy, and this may be due to the effect on platelet function, endothelial cell activation, and nitric oxide scavenging. (3) Data from both the nephrology and oncology literature suggest that there may be reduced survival with the use of ESA therapy with current malignancy or a previous history of cancer. Part of the reason for this is the increased risk of thrombotic events associated with the use of ESA therapy. (4) Anaemia is associated with reduced quality-of-life in cancer patients, and ESA therapy may improve fatigue and energy scores in cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia. Various tools have been used to assess this, including the FACT-An and the LASA scores. Most of the improvement in quality-of-life occurs between 8 and 11gdL and possibly 11 and 12 g/dL, and above 12 g/dL there is less additional improvement in quality-of-life.

Several reasons have been put forward including increasing MIC's, reduced bactercidal activity secondary to altered agr mechanisms, and tolerance to vancomycin. Alternative agents include linezolid, daptomycin and telavancin. Enterococci are the second-most common gram-positive pathogens in cancer patients with $17-25% of isolates being vancomycin-resistant. Fecal colonization with VRE is not uncommon in patients with hematological malignancies. When such patients develop febrile neutropenia, empiric coverage against VRE might be prudent. Currently linezolid, daptomycin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin are the agents with proven clinical activity against VRE. Other important pathogens include the streptococci (viridans group streptococci (VGS), streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci). Although beta-hemolytic streptococci remain penicillin susceptible, VGS and S. pneumoniae are often non-susceptible or overtly resistant t o the penicillins.

The widespread use of quinolones for prophylaxis in high-risk cancer patients has led to the emergence of quinolone resistant E. coli, which also appears to have increased virulence.

            "text": "Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) represent a major threat for cancer and immunosuppressed patients, especially for those suffering of hematological malignancies. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, the administration of several immunosuppressive agents, antimicrobial agents, transplantations, surgical procedures and the use of devices are among the predisposing factors for the development of IFIs. Candida spp have been recognized as cause of such infections already some decades ago, while Cryptococcus spp had been also observed in patients with lymphomas. Aspergillus spp were recognized later on as threatening organisms for leukemic patients, while Zygomycetes and Fusarium spp become apparent rather recently as major risks. Although many new diagnostic methods and tools have been developed, diagnosis of IFIs is often problematic and many times is only a post-mortem event. Hence, prophylaxis for these infections is of paramount importance, especially in patients with prolonged and profound immunosuppression. During the last decade new antifungal drugs have been enriching our armamentarium although the fight against fungi started five decades ago with amphotericin B. In the 80's a step ahead had been achieved with the first azoles ketoconazole and miconazole, which had minimal impact on IFIs. These drugs, whowever, heralded the production of other azole compounds such as fluconazole which played a major role against Candida, and itraconazole which was effective also against Aspergillus.",

These formulations are still in use as effective therapeutic modalities. The production of newer azoles such as voriconazole, that made the difference in the treatment of aspergillosis, and posaconazole, that has a very broad spectrum, offered new weapons against IFIs. The new class of echinocandins, that includes caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin, broadened even further the antifungal armamentarium. However, despite the development of effective drugs the cancer patient remains a sensitive host. Immunosuppression minimizes the activity of antifungal agents. Hence, the infectious diseases community is looking forward to new compounds as well as to the results of ongoing clinical trails assessing the activity of combination antifungal treatments. It must be emphasized, however, that restoration of the immune system, if possible, remains the cornerstone for the treatment and prophylaxis of fungal infections of patients with neoplastic diseases.",

            "text": "Does neoplastic therapy improve cancer pain? Pain is one of the most feared and common complications of advanced cancer. Fortunately, the majority, up to 90%, of patients achieve effective relief of pain utilizing standard approaches to pain management. For the minority of patients with metastatic disease and curable cancer, effective antineoplastic therapy cures the cancer and generally leads to resolution of cancer-associated pain. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with metastatic disease are not cured with currently available therapies. For patients with incurable cancer and pain, management of the pain is an essential component of optimal cancer care. The most frequent type of pain in patients with metastatic disease is bone pain secondary to osseous metastases. While the mainstay of treatment is analgesics, antineoplastic treatment does provide significant benefit. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group has demonstrated that external beam radiation therapy, whether given as a single or multiple fractions, provides complete to partial relief of pain from osseous metastases for about 60% of patients. Overall, the results are better for single sights of pain than for treatment of extensive multifocal osseous metastases. Bisphosphonates decrease and delay the occurrence of skeletal fractures from metastatic bone disease, but improve pain control to only a limited degree. For cancer pain not related to bone metastasis, radiation therapy is not usually the treatment of choice. Pharmacologic treatment is the treatment of choice for patients with advanced disease and multiple sites of pain. A purported goal of chemotherapy for patients with advanced disease is to provide symptom palliation. However, the majority of clinical trials of pharmacologic agents assess the effectiveness of treatment in advanced disease based on tumor shrinkage. In patients with metastatic breast cancer, a randomized trial evaluated the association between symptom improvement and objective tumor response. Pain was one of the symptoms that improved in those patients who had a complete or partial response to treatment. The relationship between objective tumor response and symptom improvement has not been evaluated for most disease sites. Data on the impact of chemotherapy on cancer-related pain is limited and outcomes may vary by primary site.",

The advent of polychemotherapy regimen MOPP, and later the ABVD regimen made cures possible in about 60-70% even in advanced stages. However, unexpected toxic short-and longterm side effects, of radiation and drug-co-carcinogens (mustard, cyclophoshamide, procarbazine: MOPP) induced secondary leukemias and solid tumors that amounted after 30 years to nearly 20-30%, mitigating the therapeutic breakthrough! Modern Management Strategies for HL Patients in 2010: Today modern strategies of treatment reach cure rates of 90% in nearly all stages of the disease and serve as a model for management strategies of other cancers! Treatment decision is based on an immune-histological/molecular-genetic diagnosis based on a sufficiently representive biopsy (not Fine-Needle-Aspiration!) and on the anatomical extent of the lymphoma lesions",

Environmental factors play a dominant role in the aetiology of most CRCs, but inherited predisposition can be a major risk factor. Familial colorectal cancer accounts for 10 to 15 % of all CRCs and about 5% are caused by mutations in high penetrant genes. The discovery of inherited mutations in genes associated with increased risk of cancer enables more accurate risk assessment, targeted surveillance, preventative measures and tailor-made treatment for high risk persons.Purpose of the lecture: Give a brief summary of some of the hereditary CRC syndromes with identified germline mutations as Lynch syndrome (Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC), Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), attenuated FAP (AFAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Peutz-Jegher Syndrome and Juvenile polyposis. Address cancer risk in individuals who have families with clustering of CRC but who do not have one of the high risk cancer syndromes. Clinical features, genetics and management recommendations will be covered. Conclusions: Unlike many types of tumours, tumours of the colon and rectum are highly accessible through the use of endoscopy. Surveillance can prevent the development of advanced CRC and can also have implications for treatment. This makes it important to identify high risk individuals.

Two large randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of POC: The Medical Research Council Adjuvant Gastric Infusional Chemotherapy (MAGIC) trial evaluated POC (ECF regimen) on OS of 503 resectable GC-EGJC (stomach adenocarcinomas: 74% of patients) and reported an increased OS after POC with a 5-year survival rate of 36% versus 23% (HR for death, 0.75; p \u00bc 0.009) and in the PFS (HR for progression or death, 0.66; p <0.001). (Cunningham D, et al. N Engl J Med 2006;355:11.) The FNLCC-FFCD trial conducted on 224 resectable GC-EGJC (lower oesophagus-EGJC 74% of cases; GC 26% of cases) randomized to receive a preoperative chemotherapy (2-3 cycles: monthlu FU-P regimen) followed by surgery (n \u00bc 113) and postoperative chemotherapy (n \u00bc 111). POC resulted in a better 5year OS (38% vs 24%; death HR: 0.69; p \u00bc 0.02); and 5-year DFS (34% versus 19%; HR 0.65; p \u00bc 0.003); in multivariate analysis : POC (p \u00bc 0.01) and distal site of the GC (p <0.01) were the only 2 independent prognostic factors and R0 resection rate was improved (84% vs 73%, p \u00bc 0.04).

            "text": "Thursday, 18th November 2010, 10.00-11.00 (ERATO C)Meet the Expert: Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumours Bertram WiedenmannNeuroendocrine tumors (NET) of the gastroenteropancreatic system have significantly increased over the past decades with a current incidence of approx. 5/100 000 and prevalence similar to gastric carcinomas (Modlin et al. 2008). Likely causes are an improved awareness among doctors, better diagnostic modalities such as improved immunohisto-and sero-diagnostics and also advanced imaging modalities, such as double balloon enteroscopy, MR Sellink, capsule endoscopy, PET-CT, etc.. Other causes may be also related to environmental and dietary factors. Similar to adenocarcinomas, NET have to be subdivided according to their primary tumor location, histological state of differentiation, tumor extent and hormone activity/functionality. The latter is observed in less than half of all cases. Natural courses and excessive release (hypersecretion) of peptide and biogenic amines differ considerably between primaries. For example, pancreatic primaries are characterized by a faster tumor progression and the hypersecretion of peptide hormones, such as gastrin, insulin and VIP, whereas ileal NETs are slower growing and show a hypersecretion of biogenic amines in approx. half of all cases leading to the carcinoid syndrome. In order to categorize and also treat NET better than in the past, a new TNM classification has been proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS), including the first-ever grading system (Rindi et al., 2006, 2007). A number of centers have already demonstrated that this new TNM classification is applicable in daily routine (e.g. Pape et al. 2008). In recent years, an impressive spectrum of treatment options has evolved esp. for pancreatic NETs. Current treatment includes new biologicals and small molecules such as the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the TKI sunitinib, which has shown to be efficacious esp. in the case of pancreatic primary tumors of grade 1 and 2 (Kulke et al., 2008; Yao et al. 2008). In addition, novel orally available chemotherapeutics such as temozolomide and capecitabine have shown to be efficacious in pancreatic G1 and G2 NET (Kulke et al., 2010). Furthermore, FOLFOX can also lead in poorly differentiated G3 NET to remissions, as well as to prolonging time to tumor progression (Pape et al., 2006). Biotherapeutics such as somatostatin analogues (SSA, esp. octreotide) have gained renewed attention based on their newly demonstrated antiproliferative action in midgut tumors (Rinke et al., 2009).In addition, the new SSA pasireotide has been shown to control the carcinoid syndrome in patients who had been refractory to conventional therapies such as octreotide or lanreotide depot. Furthermore, therapeutic advances have also been observed with radiolabeled SSA coupled with 90 Yttrium or 177 Lutetium, with the latter radionuclide leading to a TTP of up to 40 months(Kwekkeboom  et al., 2008). Finally, new ablative therapeutic procedures using, for example, selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) in combination with radiolabled microspheres seems to be also promising, though valid data are still lacking. In summary, smaller monocentric, as well as several multicentric, prospective trials have shown that treatment of NETS has been considerably improved. It is the aim of the presentation to summarize existing data and present treatment algorithms according to the various primaries and functionality of NET.",

This view is largely based on two randomized studies that have demonstrated that CN is associated with a survival advantage in selected mRCC patients treated with IFN-a. By contrast, patients with poor performance, large metastatic burden or highly aggressive subtypes such as sarcomatoid features are unlikely to benefit from CN, and may be better off with systemic therapy first. Two phase III randomized studies are now open for accrual, addressing respectively the questions of the role and the timing of nephrectomy. The CARMENA trial is a phase III randomized study comparing nephrectomy plus sunitinib versus sunitinib without nephrectomy in first-line metastatic RCC. Primary end point is overall survival. Rather than investigating indiscriminately whether or not CN is of benefit, another approach is to identify those individuals in whom CN alters the natural course of mRCC. Such identification would require understanding of new clinical and molecular predictors.",

This is surprising considering that an Equality Act has been finally passed this year in the United Kingdom stating the importance of attending to gender; to both men's and women's needs with respect to cancer care. Moreover relatively little is known regarding the ways in which men participate and adhere to randomisation into clinical trials that involves the important question of communication. The little that is known rests on a 'deficit model' of patient-hood. Patients have been shown to 'misunderstand' important facets of clinical trials, thus leading to inadequate patient samples that sometimes results in a curtailing of expensive endeavours. Method:",

Older patients are perceived as an under-served group but will become the majority used group for cancer services in the future. Recent changes in European law require that cancer patients receive optimal care regardless of age. Why examine age issues? There are few studies clarifying support needs according to age. Different physical and social circumstances mean that the needs of older patients are likely to differ from younger patients. Differences in functional impairment, social support networks, lower income and other co-morbidities associated with aging will contribute to different support and psychosocial needs. The issues will be introduced and briefly overviewed. Alongside is reported details of a study aimed at clarifying support care needs in elderly cancer patients. Research questions:[1] Do psychosocial, informational and support care needs in the elderly differ from younger patients?[2]  What are the points of difference according to age?Method: Prospective Questionnaire survey methodology using [1] Support Care Needs Survey (SCNS), [2] Information Satisfaction Questionnaire: Short Form (ISC), [3] EORTC QLQ; functional and global QL subscales Participants: N \u00bc 400 patients (n \u00bc 200 seniors; n \u00bc 200 non-seniors)",
