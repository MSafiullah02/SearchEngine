HRVs are the most prevalent cause of acute respiratory tract illnesses (ARIs) which usually commence in the upper respiratory tract (URT). ARIs are the leading cause of morbidity in children under 5 years and occur in all seasons [ 2 , 3 ] . ARIs linked to HRV infections are associated with excessive and perhaps inappropriate antibiotic prescribing [ 4 ] and with signifi cant direct and indirect healthcare expenditure [ 5 , 6 ] . ARI incidence is highest in the fi rst 2 years of life, with up to 13 episodes per year including up to six positive for an HRV, and it is not uncommon to average one infection per child-month [ 3 , 7 -9 ] . In preschool-aged children, nearly 50 % of general practitioner visits are for ARI [ 10 ] , many of which are self-limiting. ARIs can often be managed in the community with supportive care from parents, but complications can arise that require a medical visit for management of asthma, otitis media, or sinusitis [ 11 ] . HRVs replicate in nasal cells, sinus cells, bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) [ 12 , 13 ] , and smooth muscle cells [ 14 ] but not in monocytes [ 15 ] or dendritic cells (DCs) [ 16 ] . The infl ammatory immune response they trigger very soon after infection has its greatest impact in the young, the elderly, those with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and in the immunocompromised.

Their cousins, the four enterovirus species (EV-A, EV-B, EV-C, and EV-D), are also found in the airways at times. Most systematic and mechanistic studies of HRV etiology and pathogenesis have been informed by studies in adults, mostly prior to the discovery of HRV-Cs. Adults exhibit reduced symptoms from HRV infections because of prior exposure and the resultant protective immune memory which that imparts (see Sect. 7.3 ). Furthermore, many modern studies (1) draw conclusions about lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease using URT specimens and (2) infrequently sample, doing so across small cross sections of time. These limitations have hampered attempts to associate virus detection and disease. Current thinking is that HRV-Cs may be key players in asthma exacerbations although our inability to culture them routinely has hindered our progress in understanding their role. The impact of the HRVs has been underestimated for decades, and the concept of the HRVs as a very large assemblage of genetically, immunogenically, antigenically, and temporally distinct and stable viral entities remains rare; they are more commonly considered a single variable virus, a view that science does not support.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The disease most commonly associated with the airways and resulting from HRV infection is the common cold, a selflimiting coryzal illness [ 17 -19 ] .

Intensive analyses reported that recombination is not a driving force for the evolution of HRV types [ 144 , 153 , 154 ] . Some discrepancies are likely because of the different number of sequences used, the different origins of the viruses used for sequencing, and the analysis methods employed. HRV-C evolution seems to have been more affected by prior recombination, than is apparent for members of HRV-A or HRV-B. This is similar to the EV species but with far fewer predicted recombination events than for EV evolution [ 114 , 151 , 155 , 156 ] .

VP1, VP2, and VP3 (each ~30 kDa) are to some extent exposed on the capsid surface, whereas VP4 (~7 kDa) is internalized and associated with viral RNA. Five protomers come together at a point around a fi vefold axis, and this cluster is called the pentamer. The fi vefold axis is circumscribed by a cleft referred to as the \"canyon.\" VP1, VP2, and VP3 are each formed by a convoluted set of protein sheets and loops [ 159 ] .

There is sometimes an emphasis on the high number of HRV cases that are identifi ed in the presence of another virus, and including HRV testing does raise the frequency of pathogen detection above one per sample [ 231 ] .

In extreme cases, half of all HRV detections can be found concurrently with another virus.

It is clear, however, that co-detections are not an anomaly or an error due to \"overly sensitive\" PCR tests; they are evidence of further biological complexity that, until recently, remained hidden from us. Recent studies have shown that the initial impression of HRVs being overrepresented in these cases was incorrect. Closer analysis of viral co-detections has revealed patterns [ 231 , 244 ] . These became clear when codetections were examined bidirectionally, not just how many HRVs were positive for virus X but also how many of virus X cases were positive for an HRV.

Often parents notice a symptomatic illness before an infection is detected in the laboratory [ 3 ] , supporting the importance of diaries in longitudinal home-based community studies. Nonetheless, even with the support of telephone interviews and home visits, milder cold symptoms may be missed. It is not uncommon for an asymptomatic control to subsequently become symptomatic or have been symptomatic before sampling [ 8 , 266 ] . Some studies employ sensitive symptom scoring systems [ 267 ] , but the criteria for being symptomatic are usually designed to describe and clearly discriminate overt or more \"severe\" illnesses, those with obvious and measurable signs. Strict defi nitions help improve patient management and the commencement or better direction of treatment or cohorting. However, in research studies the arbitrary degree of severity required for reporting a symptomatic event often overlooks very simple changes in host biology due to a virus's replication. These changes to the norm are mild but nonetheless represent disease (a disorder of structure or function that produces specifi c symptoms or that affects a specifi c location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury) in the literal sense. Such minor or short-lived, often unrecorded [ 3 ] , indications of infection include sinus pain, headache, sore throat, earache, watery eyes, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, and mood changes. Within families, HRVs are frequently transmitted from VSIG ACTIVATED \"SHIELDS UP\" a b children who are usually symptomatic [ 204 ] . Infants frequently exposed to other children have more asymptomatic viral infections [ 8 ] . Among infected adult family members, asymptomatic infections are more likely [ 204 ] . Among older parents, whether their children live at home or not, asymptomatic infections are more frequent following HRV challenge than among adults without children or in younger parents [ 268 ] . In a study of viral species in age-stratifi ed cases and controls, signifi cantly lower viral loads were found in those without the required symptoms [ 269 ] . QPCR may prove useful to determine viral load cutoffs to address this issue in the future, although the respiratory tract is a diffi cult tissue for qPCR [ 200 ] . The high sensitivity of PCR-based methods has raised concerns over the clinical relevance of a virus-positive result [ 269 ] . It is clear that a proportion, around fi ve to 28 % of study-defi ned asymptomatic control populations [ 90 , 91 , 269 ] , are virus positive using sensitive PCR-based methods. This may vary up to nearly 50 % of cases when stratifi ed by age, virus, and season or when including highrisk populations [ 8 , 269 ] . Every respiratory virus, even IFVs and HRSV, can be found in cases without symptoms at the time of specimen collection even after specifi c inoculation of adults [ 137 , 269 , 270 ] . This is a complex and incomplete story in need of more research, and so it is frustrating that positivity in asymptomatic people is often used to rank viral importance. Better data are required from asymptomatic controls for any conclusion to be drawn about causality [ 266 ] , but this requirement often disregards the memory of a normal functioning protective host immunity. It is the host response that defi nes the degree of clinical severity for the infl ammatory disease that is the hallmark of an ARI [ 271 ] . It is well known that previous exposure to a virus affords protection from the full clinical spectrum of disease upon repeat exposure to that virus. It should come as no surprise then that HRVs, which usually cause brief infection anyway, could well produce only minor signs and symptoms upon reinfection. The unique and extremely personal infection history of each member of a control group cannot be determined unless they are part of a longitudinal cohort. So, what do cohort studies, supported by comprehensive PCR-based testing, tell us about asymptomatic virus infections? Some cohort studies do not look in asymptomatic children, seeking samples only at times of symptomatic illness [ 66 , 246 , 272 ] . A birth cohort of children enrolled and sampled when ill and every 6 months for 24 months identifi ed HRVs 14-28 % of infants and toddlers who had no nasal symptoms (defi ned solely by the presence of rhinorrhea) [ 273 ] . The Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) birth cohort followed 285 infants at high risk for allergies and asthma for 12 months and identifi ed HRV infections as preceding (mean age of fi rst detection, 4 months) those of HRSV (mean age at least 6 months), and HRVs were found in 35 % of asymptomatic versus 61 % of moderately to severely ill patients; the most frequently symptomatic children also had the greatest proportion of asymptomatic infections [ 8 ] . In a study of 58 children with asthma sampled weekly for 5 weeks during each of two peak HRV seasons, nearly two-thirds who were virus positive but not sensitized to at least one allergen showed no asthma symptoms, and nearly half showed no ARI symptoms; in the children who were sensitized, less than one-third showed no asthma symptoms, and only a fi fth had no ARI symptoms [ 227 ] . A convenience population of 15 healthy children (1-9 years old) without asthma were followed during at least three seasons, and picornaviruses were detected in 5 % of 740 specimens (21 % of infections) not associated with symptoms, The impact of HRV typing and of sampling based only on symptoms. The example provided here diagrammatically represents a single, hypothetical monitoring period, starting at time = 0, for a single individual. The period of potentially detectable HRV is indicated by an open box. If sampling occurred at each time point ( 0 -6 ) and HRV positives were genotyped, it would be apparent that three different strains infected the individual, although discerning HRV-X from HRV-Z at time point 3 would require a molecular cloning approach. Illness, in different forms, may have continued over the entire period depending on the symptoms required/recorded and the period of time represented by the monitoring period. In this case a clinical diagnosis may record only a single symptomatic episode. Genotyping may not be performed, and sampling may be intermittent, and so association between viral type or species and disease is impossible. In the study examples indicated by ( a ) start and fi nish sampling or ( b ) symptomatic sampling, ( asterisks mark sampling times in fi lled bars), the laboratory data would have made only one or two identifi cations, respectively. In the third example, ( c ) frequent sampling of this type has previously led to conclusions of HRV persistence or chronic shedding; when combined with genotyping, it becomes apparent that different HRV types are present although 9 of the 25 infections came from households with an infected sibling [ 3 ] . In summary, there is clear evidence for the presence of HRVs in asymptomatic controls. A precise proportion cannot yet be defi ned. Some study controls show signs of a \"lead-in\" period where RNA positivity precedes an ARI defi ned on follow-up, while others may have been defi ned as symptomatic if more symptoms had been accounted for.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 320, "text": "[ 3 , 96 , 204 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 416, "end": 421, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 742, "end": 753, "text": "[ 8 , 266 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 810, "end": 817, "text": "[ 267 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}, {"start": 1595, "end": 1600, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1867, "end": 1874, "text": "[ 204 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 1962, "end": 1967, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2054, "text": "[ 204 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 2245, "end": 2252, "text": "[ 268 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2412, "text": "[ 269 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 2569, "end": 2576, "text": "[ 200 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 2696, "end": 2703, "text": "[ 269 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 2809, "end": 2826, "text": "[ 90 , 91 , 269 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3006, "end": 3017, "text": "[ 8 , 269 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3182, "end": 3201, "text": "[ 137 , 269 , 270 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3472, "end": 3479, "text": "[ 266 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF266"}, {"start": 3712, "end": 3719, "text": "[ 271 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF271"}, {"start": 4412, "end": 4430, "text": "[ 66 , 246 , 272 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4646, "end": 4653, "text": "[ 273 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 5108, "end": 5113, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 5493, "end": 5500, "text": "[ 227 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF227"}, {"start": 7199, "end": 7204, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Asymptomatic Infections"}, {"text": "Mechanisms and Routes of Transmission", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "6"}, {"text": "HRVs have been found at extra-respiratory sites.

Blood was also positive for HRV RNA and infectious virus from infants at necropsy [ 276 , 277 ] , and HRV RNA was detected in the plasma of children with asthma, bronchiolitis, or common cold [ 76 ] . An HRV was once isolated from feces [ 203 ] , and more recently higher than expected loads of HRVs were detected in fecal specimens from children with suspected meningitis and fever of unknown origin [ 77 ] , with gastroenteritis [ 278 ] , and in a child with pericarditis [ 275 ] . Nonetheless, the nasopharynx is still considered the main site of focal virus production [ 279 ] , regardless of inoculation route [ 280 ] , and most studies of transmission routes have centered on the URT. In contrast to IFV and HRSV, HRV infection involves less destruction of tissue. Ciliated epithelial cells are sloughed off in proportion to the severity of an HRV ARI, but this damage is minimal and does not occur during the viral incubation period or with subclinical infections [ 137 , 281 ] . The incubation period between infection and onset of virus shedding into nasal secretions is 1-4 days with shed viral titers peaking in adults between days 2 and 10 [ 44 , 282 ] . The time until successful HRV transmission among adults in a childless family setting is usually 5-8 days and requires the donor to be shedding at least 10 3 TCID 50 at some stage, to have recoverable virus on the hands and in the nares, enough shared time, and a moderate to severe ARI [ 283 ] .

In the past, household cross infection, determined by ARI, was low, about fi ve exposures to infected members required for infection [ 17 ] despite viral loads in nasal washings peaking at 1.6 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 /mL [ 44 ] . Experimental transmission was also reportedly ineffi cient [ 45 ] . In contrast, \"naturally\" close-quartered military populations, interacting over 1-4 weeks, experienced rapid spread of HRVs to >50 % of the group [ 54 ] . The use of PCR recently clarifi ed this discrepancy, confi rming that frequent transmission in families is more common than culture-based studies had identifi ed, often resulting in asymptomatic infection among older siblings and parents [ 204 ] . PCR has helped defi ne the scope of viral RNA, if not actual infectious virus, survival, and spread. Transmission studies require infectious HRV, and so the HRV-Cs do not contribute to the historical data. Under crowded or intimate conditions and with more severe colds, transmission reaches 38-100 % [ 283 , 292 ] . In some studies, both large-and small-particle aerosols proved ineffi cient, supported by a low isolation rate from saliva (39 % compared to 65 % of hand washes and 50 % of nasal swabs) [ 44 , 47 , 293 ] and from only 8.3 % of participants exposed to large-particle aerosols [ 293 ] . In other human donor-recipient model studies however, aerosol proved to be the main transmission route among antibody-free adults [ 46 , 282 ] . The discrepancy may have been due to insuffi ciently long or intense exposure in the earlier aerosol experiments [ 45 , 267 ] . Apart from particle size, spread of virus by aerosol is affected by existing nasal obstruction which can divert secretions from the nares to contaminate saliva, the presumptive source of virus in coughs and sneezes [ 44 ] . When exposed to 10 liters of a small-particle aerosol, 10 1 TCID 50 of HRV-15 was associated with fever and prominent tracheobronchitis in antibody-free (<1:2) adult volunteers but not when delivered via nasal drops or a coarse aerosol [ 46 ] .

There may be a role for repeated challenge by HRVs and other respiratory viruses leading to infl ammation and tissue remodeling. The host response to HRV infection can be broadly broken into the innate (very fast, encoded in the germ line, nonadaptive) and adaptive (slower to develop, reliant on T cells, B cells, and the generation of antibody) responses. While the innate system is \"always watching,\" it is signifi cantly amplifi ed by virus infection.

Internal-or surface-mounted PRRs include sentinels that specifi cally recognize picornavirus RNA and protein and, in doing so, trigger an immune circuit that results in the production of IFNs and subsequently hundreds of IFN-stimulated gene products. The innate response to viral infection hinges on inducing two type I IFNs (initially IFN-\u00df then IFN-\u03b1), secreted cytokines that produce antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory outcomes [ 301 ] . The type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb1 or IL-29, IFN-\u03bb2 or IL-28A, and IFN-\u03bb3 or IL-28B) are also produced in response to viral infection in a range of cells, although their receptor is not as widespread [ 302 ] .

IFN-\u03b1 upregulates expression of MxA, 2\u20324\u2032-OAS, and PKR [ 307 ] . The Mx pathway is also induced after virus infection but is not constitutively expressed [ 307 ] . Depending on the sentinel system stimulated, there are different pathways to VSIG activation. Those VSIGs with antiviral properties (e.g., MxA, PKR, 2\u20325\u2032OAS/RNaseL) inhibit different stages of virus replication and strengthen an antiviral state in the host. While this state is well known, the nature of its induction by different respiratory viruses and the impact of induction upon the replication of other respiratory viruses are topics for considerable ongoing research. One pathway to IFN induction relies on the IFN-upregulated cytosolic sentinels retinoic acid inducible gene RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I (specifi c for IFAV and others) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5, specifi c for picornaviruses and others) [ 306 , 308 ] .

Thus, it is diffi cult to proceed in many areas, including basic virology, seroepidemiology, immunobiology, and antiviral testing. Determination of the receptors for these new HRVs would aid the search for a more accessible culture system. There would be great interest in a vaccine for some or all of the HRVs, but with increasing evidence of the interactions between HRVs, their hosts, and other respiratory viruses, it may not be wise to interfere before we fully understand what the impact of losing a constantly circulating HRV challenge would be. Antivirals specifi cally targeting the HRVs may be a better bet, but routine HRV testing and genotyping will fi rst need to be more widespread as surveillance for antiviral resistance will be an important component of monitoring the success of any intervention. Studies to determine whether there are differences in clinical and immunobiological impact between the many different types are lacking but would greatly improve our ability to plan future routine testing, understand all the clinical responses to the diverse HRVs and to outbreaks of ARI, and improve HRV epidemiology.
