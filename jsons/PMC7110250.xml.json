In brief, all adult patients presenting with acute febrile respiratory illness requiring hospitalization were admitted to designated medical wards, and droplet precautions were implemented. Patients were admitted to the hospital if they developed potentially serious medical conditions or if the exacerbation of their underlying chronic illnesses or severe symptoms were considered to be unmanageable at home [7]. Nasopharyngeal aspiration was performed for an immunofluorescence assay to detect influenza A and B infections [24\u201326]. According to local guidelines [1, 7, 12, 16, 25], all patients hospitalized with confirmed influenza within 2 days after symptom onset received a standard course of oseltamivir treatment (75 mg twice daily for 5 days). However, for patients who present later, the decision regarding antiviral treatment was made by their physicians. Patients were otherwise treated and discharged according to usual clinical practice [7]",

After viral RNA extraction, the resulting complementary DNA products (cDNAs) were used immediately for real-time PCR, with primers designed to detect the influenza A (all human subtypes, including the circulating H3N2 and H1N1) or B virus RNA by targeting the M-gene [22]. The influenza virus A\u2013 and B\u2013specific fluorogenic probes (Appendix A, which appears only in the online version of the JournalAppendix A, which appears only in the online version of the Journal) were designed to anneal to an internal sequence of the amplified region [22]. The real-time PCR reactions were carried out using the StepOne real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Plasmids containing a known copy number of amplification targets were included in the real-time PCR assay to generate a standard curve for quantification of test samples. The lower detection limit for this influenza A real-time PCR assay is 250 copies/mL, and the lower limit of detection is 100 copies/mL for the influenza B real-time PCR assay",

Similarly, significant variables (P<.1) were entered into backward stepwise logistic regression models to determine independent factors associated with viral clearance (ie, undetectable viral RNA, below the detection limit of the RT-PCR assay) at 1 week after symptom onset [18]. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each explanatory variable. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis was used to determine independent factors associated with hospital discharge [7]. An adjusted hazard ratio >1 indicated a higher chance of discharge from the hospital. In all analyses, a P value of <.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All probabilities were 2-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 14.0 (SPSS)",

Consistent with recent reports [18, 28], prolonged viral RNA detection (for 5\u20137 days after illness onset) is observed among these patients and is associated with longer duration of illness and hospitalization [7, 17\u201320]. Our findings suggest that prolonged viral replication may be more common than previously recognized in patients hospitalized with influenza and is not limited to immunosuppressed patients, such as those with hematological malignancies [29\u201332]",

However viral level decrease is influenced by the timing of initiation, with the best effect (lowest viral loads) being observed with treatment initiated on the same day as symptom onset [34].

            "text": "There are several important implications. First, early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for severe influenza should be emphasized [1, 7, 12, 16, 17, 21, 34]. Patients should be encouraged to present as soon as symptoms develop, despite vaccination status [7]. Prompt laboratory diagnostic testing may be used to guide treatment [1, 7, 24, 26, 35\u201337]; RT-PCR, if available, is the test of choice because of its high sensitivity and specificity [26, 38]. If the more sensitive tests are unavailable, empirical antiviral therapy may be considered, especially during seasonal peaks (when there is a high likelihood of influenza) and when patients are seriously ill [38]. Second, an extended therapeutic time window for initiation of antiviral therapy may be considered. Previous clinical trials involving otherwise healthy and younger, nonhospitalized patients have suggested that, to produce clinical benefits, antiviral treatment has to be initiated within 48 h after symptoms initiation, because active viral replication will have largely subsided beyond that time (determined on the basis of viral cultures) [12\u201317, 34]. However, among older patients with comorbidities who present after 48 h, particularly in association with severe, persistent symptoms, the viral load may remain very high (and culture positive). Recent observational studies suggested that antiviral treatment started within 4 days after illness onset might reduce mortality among adult patients hospitalized with influenza [6, 9, 39]. In this study, antiviral treatment started within 4 days of illness was observed to enhance viral load decrease and clearance when compared with no treatment, after adjustment for confounding variables [17]. Viral clearance correlates with symptom resolution and may be associated with shortened duration of hospitalization [7, 18, 19]. Randomized, controlled trials are necessary to clarify further the clinical benefit of delayed therapy, and this study of viral kinetics provides useful information for planning (eg, therapy guided by the viral load, instead of time of symptom onset) [16, 39]. Third, a more stringent approach to infection control may be necessary to avoid nosocomial transmission, because hospitalized patients may have high viral loads and a long duration of viral shedding, as detected by both RT-PCR and culture methods [17, 18, 29, 30]. These measures include strict droplet precautions and, preferably, isolation for an extended period of time (>5 days) [1, 18, 28, 29, 40], especially for patients without antiviral treatment [13, 15, 18, 28, 29, 40, 41]. In addition, aerosol-generating procedures or devices should be used with caution [29, 40, 41]",

Patients diagnosed within 2 days after symptom onset received treatment [7, 25], but there was no formal recommendation regarding treatment of patients who presented later. However, provider bias may not explain our findings, because it is more likely that sicker patients with ongoing symptoms (which reflect active viral replication) were prescribed antiviral treatments despite their later presentation, whereas those patients with subsiding symptoms were left untreated. Also, virus concentrations in the upper respiratory tract (assayed with nasal and throat swabs) may not precisely reflect the virus replication levels in the lower respiratory tract, although this approach has been used successfully to provide a semiquantitative estimate of the virus burden in studies of natural infections [8, 14, 15, 21]. Similar to other studies, we observed lower positive rates for virus culture, compared with RT-PCR assay [18, 26, 38]. Although RT-PCR could have detected nonviable virus, it is also possible that the culture method is too insensitive to detect a lower level of virus excretion (because of treatment or natural defense; see Appendix A, which appears only in the online version of the JournalAppendix A, which appears only in the online version of the Journal) or that the results are falsely negative because of virus inactivation in vitro [18, 38]. These implications on infectiousness would require further study. Nonetheless, we still observed a high proportion (>20% to >40%) of untreated patients with persistent virus isolation beyond day 4\u20135 of illness, which strengthened our conclusions",
