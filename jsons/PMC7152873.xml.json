            "text": "One of the possible pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients resides in the administration of antiretroviral medicines [1]. The situation is complicated by the absence of ad hoc authorised pharmacological therapies. Many antivirals, including darunavir and cobicistat, were used off-label in the hospital wards as life-treating medicines for COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, their manipulation is sometimes necessary because they are not always formulated to be administered to non-cooperative patients, like those in intensive care units. Thus, the activity of hospital pharmacists for the compounding of extemporaneous suspension by manipulation of authorized medicinal products is crucial to provide such life-treating treatments to the hospital wards [2]. However, the manipulation of medicines can alter their quality profile with potential impact on the efficacy and safety of the pharmacological treatment. Therefore, such compounding activities must be guided by the provisions of the Good Compounding Practice and by other available technical guidelines to assure the required quality and the stability over time of the preparation [3].",
