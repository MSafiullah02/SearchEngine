ILI is defined as acute respiratory tract infection presenting with sudden onset of symptoms; and at least one of the following four systemic symptoms: fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia; and at least one of the following three respiratory symptoms: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's clinical criteria of ILI [2]. The PIDIRAC Sentinel Surveillance Network is based on a medical sentinel network at primary-care centres coordinated by the Public Health Agency of Catalonia, that covers all seven Health regions into which the Catalan territory is divided. Primary-care centres involved in the sampling varied from the 2006/07 season to the 2011/12, ranging from 27 in the former to 38 in the latter, and covered approximately 1% of the total population in Catalonia.",

Subtyping (seasonal H1, H1pdm09 and H3) of influenza A viruses isolated on MDCK or MDCK-SIAT1 (Vircell, Granada, Spain) cell culture was performed by using the annual WHO influenza immunofluorescence assay, or directly from laboratory-confirmed clinical samples using a one-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay [5]. Influenza laboratory-confirmed samples collected from patients belonging to different age groups (0\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201365, > 65 years old), from different geographical sites and in different weeks were selected for a good representativeness of the phylogenetic and molecular characterizations of circulating influenza viruses in Catalonia throughout the period of study.",

Updated amplification and sequencing protocols are available on request. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences from the present study together with sequences from clade reference strains downloaded from the GISAID Database (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data, available at: www.platform.gisaid.org) were carried out with MEGA v5.2 [7]. Sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program, and the molecular evolutionary models of nucleotide substitutions were fitted to the multiple sequence alignments using evolutionary analyses conducted in MEGA v5.2 [7]. The phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbour-joining (NJ) distance method as implemented in MEGA v5.2 [7] with the evolutionary model with the lowest Bayesian Information criterion score. Reliability for the internal branch was assessed using the non-parametric bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. The amino acid substitutions of predicted influenza protein sequences were studied using MEGA v5.2 [7] relative to the homologous sequences of the corresponding recommended vaccine strains [8]. The potential N-linked glycosylation sites in HA1 amino acid sequences were tracked using the N-GlycoSite tool [9].",

Eighteen samples had missing data by lacking either gender information (seven samples) or age (11 samples). The mean age (\u00b1 SD) of the patients was 21.8 \u00b1 22.0 years (age range from a few months to 95 years; median: 12.0 years; interquartile range (IQR) 3.0\u201337.0 years; mode 1.0 year). Age was not normally distributed (one-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, p <0.001), and the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U-test was therefore used for comparison between two groups. Statistical age differences between male patients (mean 19.8 \u00b1 20.9 years; median 10.0; IQR 3.0\u201333.0) and female patients (mean 23.7 \u00b1 22.8 years; median 14.0; IQR 4.0\u201340.0) were significant (p <0.001). Table 1\nand Supplementary material Table S1 summarize RV detection rates by age groups and by season, respectively. The largest proportion of samples (55%) was collected from children under 15 years old. The 64% of received samples were laboratory-confirmed for single (83%) or multiple (17%) detections, mainly by FLUAV and HRV, and followed by HAdV, FLUBV and HRSV. FLUAV or HRV were detected in 74% of multiple detections. In addition, HAdV, HCoV, HPIV-2, HPIV-4 and HEV were found together with other RVs in rates over 40% of detections (see Supplementary material, Table S1). Among RV laboratory-confirmed cases there were no general differences (p 0.906) between male (49.6%) and female (50.4%) patients, but higher percentages were particularly reported for HRSV (p 0.015; OR 1.302; 95% CI 1.053\u20131.611) and HEV (p 0.020; OR 1.391; 95% CI 1.053\u20131.837) in male patients. The highest detection percentages were reported in the youngest patient group, and HAdV, HEV, HPIV-1, HPIV-3 and HRSV (Table 1) circulated preferentially in patients younger than 5 years old. Multiple RV detections were also more frequently detected in the youngest patients (p <0.001). Age differences (Table 1) were not statistically significant between patients infected by the different FLUAV subtypes (seasonal H1N1 versus H3N2: p 0.123; seasonal H1N1 versus H1N1pdm09: p 0.176; and H1N1pdm09 versus H3N2: p 0.503).",

When FLUAV and FLUBV were co-detected during a season, FLUAV was first, with the predominance of a particular FLUAV subtype, and was followed by FLUBV later (Fig. 1\n). The only exception was the 2009 influenza pandemic. A(H1N1)pdm09, which was first noted in June 2009 and which circulated showing a biphasic pattern. A first peak was detected during weeks 24\u201335 (summer months), and a second peak during weeks 41\u201349 (autumn months), before HRSV circulation and outside the usual months of influenza outbreaks (from December to March). During the first two 2009 pandemic peaks, other FLUAV subtypes (seasonal H1 and H3) and FLUBV remained almost undetected despite the large sampling done to strengthen the A(H1N1)pdm09 surveillance. During these six consecutive seasons other RV than influenza viruses were mainly detected during the cold months, often just before and after the seasonal influenza epidemics (Fig. 2\n), with scarce circulation during the inter-seasonal periods. Differences between the RV detection rates (see Supplementary material, Table S1) were observed just before and after the 2009 pandemic (p <0.05). The detection rates of HCoV, HRV, HPIV 1\u20134 and HEV increased after the pandemic (OR <1), in comparison to FLUAV, FLUBV, HAdV and HRSV (OR >1), which decreased.

During the 2006/07 season both adamantane and NAIs were the two antiviral family drugs available. In Catalonia, the first genetic oseltamivir-resistant seasonal A(H1N1) variants, which carried H275Y mutation in NA associated with antiviral resistance [10], were detected in a percentage of 7% during the 2007/08 season. These strains also carried the compensatory mutations, that favoured the global spread of H275Y variants despite the absence of drug selective pressure [10], [30]. According to WHO data, an average of approximately 24% of characterized strains in Europe were shown to possess high-level oseltamivir-resistance, ranging from no detection in some countries to 68% in Norway [30]. In addition, circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) strains are also resistant to adamantanes, since they carry the S31N mutation in M2 protein [12], [30], remaining susceptible to NAIs. Indeed, adamantanes cannot now be considered suitable for seasonal influenza treatment. In the present study, with the exception of H275Y seasonal A(H1N1) strains that did not circulate since the 2009 pandemics, no other circulating influenza strains carrying genetic markers related to NAIs resistance were found [10]. Changes within the enzyme active site or its surroundings were found in NA sequences, but further phenotyping studies should be performed. There is public health concern that the antiviral resistance genetic markers could become fixed in the viral genome, as detected in a low percentage (<1%) among circulating viruses [31]. The rapid global spread of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal A(H1N1) influenza viruses without drug pressure should serve as a reminder for close local and global surveillance.",
