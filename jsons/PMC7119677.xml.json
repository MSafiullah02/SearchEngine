The MLPA technique employs two probes which ligate in the presence of target-specific complementary sequences. The probes consist of a target-specific sequence, common primer sequences and a stretch of nucleotides that allow specific detection based on length differences (Reijans et al., 2008). The DPO technique employs target-specific primers of double the normal oligo length which contain a polydeoxy-inosine linker to gain specificity and sensitivity for the multiplex detection (Drews et al., 2008). In addition, positive detections by the MLPA and DPO assays were identified by two different automatic capillary electrophoresis detection systems.",

All virus detections, except for the inhibited samples, could be identified in a single attempt (with no interpretation differences between technicians). One sample was inhibited repeatedly in the MLPA and therefore excluded. For the DPO, the Agilent 2100 performed better than the Experion: The Agilent showed a clearer difference between background signals and specific signals. The Agilent enabled clear interpretation for 167 (of 168) samples in one attempt while the Experion yielded clear interpretation for only 157 (of 168) samples. Of the repeated electrophoresis results for six samples (3.6%: one with the Agilent, five with the Experion), the two technicians disagreed on the interpretation and therefore the complete DPO protocol was repeated. For six other samples the Experion run hampered and for these only the electrophoresis run was repeated. Additionally, six (3.6%) of the samples were inhibited using the DPO and three (1.8%) using the MLPA. The calculated amplicon sizes differed slightly between the Agilent and the Experion electrophoresis systems. The amplicon sizes were calculated based on the markers included with the kit reagents. Because of the greater performance of the Agilent, all virus detections of the MLPA and DPO, as mentioned in the results, were based on the combination with the Agilent electrophoresis.",

The MLPA assay appeared to have a greater sensitivity for all viral targets compared to that of the DPO and similar sensitivity compared to that of real-time RT-PCR. The overall specificity of the DPO assay appeared greater compared to that of MLPA. However, the sensitivity of the MLPA decreases the specificity due to a number of false-positives. It might well be that these so-called false-positive detections were in fact accurate detections as shown by the seven additional detections that were confirmed by RT-PCR during discrepancy testing. The low viral load in these samples was confirmed by the high Ct values that were obtained with the repeated extraction and RT-PCRs.",

These two viruses were chosen for the TCID50 sensitivity comparison because of the difference in sensitivity observed in the validation panel. The sensitivity of the DPO assay might be enhanced by lowering the amount of internal control (IC), because the strength of the IC signal compared to the specific target signals might be due to competitive amplification.",

First, it contains an internal control added prior to extraction and therefore controls the extraction as well as inhibition, while that of the DPO is added after the extraction. Second, the difference between the performances of the electrophoresis systems was only apparent for the DPO assay for which 11 samples had to be repeated in the Experion run (inhibited samples not taken into account). Overall, peaks were sharper and seemed more pronounced by the Experion compared to those obtained by the Agilent. However, this resulted in false-positive and/or false target identifications due to background signals. As the MLPA showed virtually no background, this problem was not encountered by the MLPA and the results of the two electrophoresis systems were identical for the MLPA assay.",

This is probably due to overgrowth of the faster growing virus which is identified as the infecting agent. Following a positive identification, the cultures are usually not examined further and dual infections could thus be missed easily. The viruses that are involved commonly in dual infections, such as coronavirus, cannot be detected easily in culture. Several studies have pointed out that a more severe clinical course is associated with dual infection (Caracciolo et al., 2008, Johnstone et al., 2008, Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 et al., 2008).
