Raw data from the NNPC is difficult to acquire, unless it has been published in scholarly journals or research reports where authors were able to obtain access. The most accessible data is that provided by NOSDRA via its oil spill monitoring site (https://oilspillmonitor.ng/) which provides data on oil and gas spills from 2006 to the present. On its face, the very existence of this data in the public domain (the raw data can be analysed by any researcher) is worthy of many accolades. But most notable upon a review of a review of the information is the poor quality of the official and publicly available data, and the substantial discrepancies that exist between different sources (for example between company data on spills the NOSDRA data and other Nigerian official such as the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the NNPC. Discrepancies of the order of 15-20% emerge in even a cursory comparison of NOSDRA and SPDC reportage of spill events1\n.",

Of these events, 71.5.% of the incidents pertained to crude oil accounting for 95.7% of total spill contaminants. The spatial distribution of spill events and spill volumes vary sharply across states (Rivers State alone accounts for just under 30% of all spill incidents - followed by Bayelsa and Delta - and 32.3% of the total quantity spilled). About 86% of oil spill incidents (76.64% of total oil spilled) in Nigeria over the period 2006-present are linked to oil installations owned by five IOCs (AGIP, Shell, Mobil, Total and Chevron)2\n. Two of forty seven private and public companies operating across the delta - NAOC (Agip) and SPDC (Shell) account for approximately 75% of spill incidents. For the period 2006- March 2020, Agip accounts for 5797 spills and 172,997 barrels (30 barrels per spill) while SPDC has 3421 spills and a total spill release of 306,708 (90 barrels per spill). 3\n",

NNPC pipeline loss data (for the five regions of the country) documents over 35,000 incidents since 2005 which amount to a quantity of oil lost almost 40 times larger than the total spill volume for the Niger delta on its oil monitoring site! Of these 488 are due to \u201cequipment failure\u201d (roughly 1.3%). The volume of \u2018petroleum products\u2019 lost over that period was 4,737,046 metric tons (33.7 million barrels)5\n. Data on \u2018crude oil losses\u2019 - only available for a five-year (2013-2018) - amounted to 4,946,150 barrels, a figure more than 7 times higher than that reported by NOSDRA for 2006 to the present (641,239). Similarly a study comparing monthly oil spill data from NOSDRA with annual data from NNPC discovered \u2013 to take one example among many \u2013 a discrepancy in the year 2006 of between 300 and 3000 in the number of annual spills (Yeeles and Akporiaye, 2016).",

Department of Petroleum Resources data cited in Ejiba, Onya and Adams (2016) for the years 2010-2014 offers total numbers of spills with a discrepancy to the NOSDRA database of over 60% annually. While the NNPC figures referenced above are much higher than NOSDRA's, the DPR figures cited by Ejiba, Onya and Adams (2016) are considerably lower than NOSDRAs. NOSDRA records a total-barrels spilled figure greater than double the DPR figures cited therein (ibid). The UNDP Niger Delta Human Development Report published in 2006 indicates that \u201cavailable records show a total of 6,817 oil spills between 1976 and 2001, a loss of approximately three million barrels of oil\u201d of which more than 70% was not recovered (UNDP 2006, p76).Two-thirds of these spills (69%) occurred off-shore, a figure which seems implausible.",

The SPDC spill database provided 19 records for the 2013-2019 period7\n. Among the SPDC recorded spills in this area, one attributed to operational failure specified the following information in November 2019: \u201cReported Date 2018-07-12; Amount Spilled 180; Spill Cause - Operational; Spill Location 16\" Nun River - Kolo Creek Pipeline at Oporoma; Terrain Type -Land: Clean up Status -Spill was contained on 13 Jul 2018, recovery completed on 14 Oct 2018, assessment completed on 09 Apr 2019, clean-up and remediation completed on 20 Sep 2019, site certification planned to be completed on December 2019\u201d.

Although a JIV survey and report file are named and visible on the SPDC cite, a cross reference on the NOSDRA site turns up no recorded spill equivalent to this event. We reference this as a relatively large spill caused by operational failure in a riverine zone where spills are frequently categorized as sabotage. Additionally, the SPDC spill record indicates the terrain as land when in fact Oporoma is located in the creeks, and thus should be categorized as \u2018swamp\u2019 \u2013 a factor of importance given the difficulty of measuring spill spread in riverine areas.

Subsequently a \u2018risk based assessment\u2019 (Form B) is to be submitted by the oil company whose facilities are affected within two weeks of a spill; this includes clarifying information on the cause, method of containment, weather conditions at time of observation and some further details on the spill extent and impacts as well as a proposed clean-up. This is to be further detailed by the oil firm staff responsible in a description of oil spill clean-up/remediation (Form C), due within an unspecified time frame detailing further environmental impact and clean up information, compensation to affected residents, remediation details, results of lab tests, overall cost of the spill and a rehabilitation plan. The JIV form itself includes various pieces of information that overlap with the above forms, recording observations at the site of the oil spill, communities affected and the extent of spill \u2013 and terrain- around these communities. The form includes check-boxes and multiple choice questions that cover visual observations of the area and circumstances around the spill point including the \u2018o'clock\u2019 position of an observed hole in a pipe. As well will see the use of O'clock position has been critiqued in advocacy analyses of the JIV and spill reporting processes. The form also includes checkboxes to indicate the kind of properties affected (eg. farmland, fishing pond or net, surface water and venerable impacts), the nature of the impacts (eg. stained net, dead fish or vegetation) and the delineation of the impacted area (within or external to a company's facilities or Right of Way and whether samples were taken.

There a is strong incentive for the operating firm to attribute cause to sabotage rather than operational failure. The same applies to the Nigerian state and given the joint venture arrangement through which the NNPC is majority shareholder. The participation of representatives of state regulatory institutions present at these investigations is financed by the operating firm. Operators may withhold per diems or offer kickbacks each of which influence the real and perceived objectivity of these representatives. There are also significant financial and structural factors likely to produce under-estimates of spill volumes. Among these, the volume of the spill drives estimates for compensation, yet companies \u2013 with a clear conflict of interest in the results- essentially control the estimates. The 2013 Amnesty report notes various irregularities in presented data. These include major discrepancies between publicly posted SPDC data and the data indicating spills attributed to SPDC on the NOSDRA website, and the data reported by Shell's Nigerian subsidiary SPDC versus Royal Dutch Shell internationally in the period 2007-2012. As we discussed above, a review of the information posted by Shell and NOSDRA since 2013 reveals that this discrepancy has continued. SPDCs data indicates a lower number of spills to those reported by NOSDRA. However, despite the lower number, SPDCs data includes spills that are not searchable in the NOSDRA database.",

Between 1989 and 1994 the company reported an average of 221 spills per year. According to Shell, during this time period 50 percent of the oil spilt by volume was due to corrosion, 21 percent due to operational problems and 28 percent due to sabotage.\u201d (Amnesty 2013, p. 11). Amnesty describes, via procedural unpacking by Accufacts, the political economic bias in the JIV and NOSDRA data we refer to above. An Accufacts survey revealed serious problems in the technical basis of spill assessment: for instance, teams assess surface area based on rough measurements. They reviewed various photos from JIVs which had been deemed sabotage in the JIV process, yet which Accufacts re-assessed as the result of corrosion or welding failure. In particular, the use of both 1) ultrasonic readings (UT) and 2) the use of the \u2018o'clock\u2019 position to ascertain sabotage as cause are appraised as inaccurate and unscientific, Accufacts explains:The JIV reports do not provide sufficient information to verify or properly support the indicated determination of cause. Preconceptions (such as evidence of loose soil at the release site, location of the pipe failure site - top of pipe is sabotage, while bottom of pipe is corrosion, or hole appearance) introduce prejudiced and highly probable false conclusions as to the real cause of the pipe's failure. Based on an Accufacts review of photographic evidence of some of the claimed Niger Delta pipe failures, cause determinations based on the information entered on current JIV reports can be very subjective, misleading, and downright false (Amnesty 2013, p. 27).\n",

Among the limitations spills which have moved downstream by the time the JIV occurs are not accounted for, and that density is poorly measured (Amnesty fn 82 p 75-76)10\n.

When the case was taken to the UK courts, the compensation award was increased to $55m, with Amnesty estimating that the actual volume spilled was around 100,000 barrels-60 times greater than assessed by the JIV process. According to Shell, the spill amounted to a total of 1,640 barrels of oil but Accufacts \u201c found that between one and three barrels of oil were leaking per minute \u2013 this amounted to between 1,440 and 4,320 barrels of oil flooding the Bodo area each day\u201d (Amnesty 2013, p. 29, fn 43).",

It is notable that NOSDRA's own data indicates that the largest individual spills in the central Niger Deltan state of Bayelsa are caused not by sabotage, but by operational failure, maintenance error or pipeline corrosion. Squaring with this, prior to the establishment of NOSDRA the above referenced 1995 Shell Environment Brief recorded that between 1989-1994, 71% of oil spilt by volume was due to corrosion and operational problems whereas only 28 percent was due to sabotage (cited in Amnesty 2013, p 11). Whanda et al also demonstrate the considerable proportion of spills attributable to corrosion and production error from 1989 - 2004 based on Department of Petroleum Resources data predating NOSDRA's establishment (Whanda et al 2016). But this causal attribution changes markedly in the subsequent data sets (Obida et al 2016) .Given the difficulty in causal attribution of so-called \u2018mystery leaks\u2019 - oil spills for which the source is not identified- and the structural motivation by the firm to characterize as many spills as possible to sabotage, this figure is notable. As the overall attribution to sabotage is itself suspect for the reasons discussed above, there is a significant likelihood that a considerably greater volume of oil spilled may result from direct operator error than NODSRA data suggests.",

Serious discrepancies exist between sources. The assignation of cause to those oil spills documented in the publicly available data is especially contentious. Until the 2011 UNEP study on the Ogoni region, precious little high-quality environmental data existed, and the reliability of, and confidence in, oil spill data decreases as any investigation pushes further back in history. Data pertaining to the 1960s and 1970s and even into the 1980s for example is scanty, yet it is known that there were massive spills during the first decades of oil production (Anejionu, Ahiarammunnah & Nri-ezedi 2015, 2). Among these, there were massive spills in 1979 (at Forcados) and 1980 (the Funiwa offshore well #5) each of which exceeded by most estimates 400,000 barrels, yet there has been no full accounting of either (Kostianoy et al 2014)11\n.",

The implications of extensive global environmental injustice prompt the reassessment of sustainability measurement on a transnational scale (Veraart, Smits and van der Vleuten 2020) and have been the pivot of much scholarship on extractivism and global markets. While Nigerian researchers have conducted important studies examining the health and ecological impacts of the oil and gas industry for some time (Ordinioha and Brisibe 2013; Chimerenka et al 2018), in some cases structural factors lead to publication in journals that Western science does not view as thoroughly vetted. Further independent research is required, necessitating proper funding and commitment by national and international organizations. Recent studies have confirmed the appalling impacts of oil spills on human health in the Niger Delta, as per a pioneering 2019 article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that establishes a causal relationship between oil spills and neo-natal mortality in the region (Bruederle and Hodler 2019). The \u2018epistemological vertigo\u2019 that arises from reviewing inconsistent data points to the need for rigorous ongoing toxicological and health research as an essential component of assessing and remediating the long-term impacts of egregious oil pollution in the Niger Delta.",

Yet as Nwadishi and Nnimmo Bassey point out in this issue, environmental data is a clear gap in the material generated via formal Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative audits, even in Nigeria where civil society pressure has led to significant disclosures through the EITI. Of course in its original design EITI was not intended to be a tool for the exploration and determination of the costs of operations on the ground on the oilfields (Van Alstine 2017; Haufler 2010). As growing numbers and volumes of oil spills have been attributed to sabotage, however, upon which basis the oil industry withholds compensation, the question of pollution is increasingly central to the issues of financial transparency and revenue allocation in the Niger Delta. Decades of pollution and its impact on local agrarian production, arguably, have created the conditions in which tapping of pipelines is one of the few sources of reliable income available to many local youth which complicates the question of \u2018cause\u2019 even in the case of clear sabotage. Understanding and quantifying historical and ongoing pollution is thus central to assessing livelihood options available to Niger Deltan residents.",

There is no single definition of a pipeline \u2018spill incident\u2019 under Canadian law, which leads to confused regulation and reporting across crown land \u2013 under both provincial and federal jurisdiction. We note in our work on the oil industry in Nigeria and elsewhere that the time commitment involved in reviewing such inconsistent data diverts attention from the broader question of accountability for socio-ecological deterioration. The absence of full-cost accounting for environmental harm allows extensive capital accumulation for corporations and shareholders (Franks et al 2014), while impoverishing those who reside next to sites of oil production.",
