            "text": "Quinine has been used since the 1800s as prophylaxis for malaria, primarily by non-indigenous visitors. Quinine was largely replaced by chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and related compounds in the 1950s, and these drugs have been used widely and intensely by natives of endemic areas as well as visitors. The mode of action of \u201cchloroquine anti-malarial drugs\u201d (Cq) is not clear. However, Cq may suppress the transcription-factor NF-kappa-B [1], which normally up-regulates Bcl-2 and other anti-apoptotic proteins, leading to apoptosis [2], [3]. Recently, it has been shown that caspase-independent disruption of the mitochondrial membrane regulated by the Bcl-2 family proteins is the rate-limiting step for apoptosis induced by hydroxychloroquine [4]. It is also noted that Cq drugs are finding applications in autoimmune diseases where they seem to facilitate apoptosis of abnormally persistent clones of T-cells [5]. Thus, it is reasonable think that Cq drugs may prevent malaria by minimizing reproduction of the parasite in the first stage of its life cycle in the liver by premature apoptosis of schizonts. The malaria parasite invades erythrocytes only after extensive replication (up to 10,000 times) in the liver.",

Invasion by an intracellular parasite is expected to cause stress in the host cell. This stress would normally be adequate to provoke p53-dependent apoptosis and this would typically limit such infections. However, it is common for intracellular parasites (viruses, bacteria, protozoa, etc.) to manipulate the apoptosis pathway of their host cells to allow maximum replication of the parasite before the host cell is killed [6], [7], [8], [9]. Sometimes intracellular parasites provide their own anti-apoptotic proteins [10] and sometimes they induce the host cells to over-express the host\u2019s anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, IAP, caspase inhibitors, FLIP). Thus, exposure of infected host cells to drugs that work against the parasite-driven up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins is an ecological pressure on the parasite that will result in evolution of strains of parasites that are more effective (quantitatively and/or qualitatively) at preventing pre-mature apoptosis of host cells. While these new \u201canti-apoptotic strains\u201d may be subdued under the continuous influence of the pro-apoptotic drug, they may prove quite virulent without it.",

Some of the new \u201canti-apoptotic strains\u201d of common parasites have become important pathogens because they can replicate in greater numbers in tissues where they previously may have had no niche (e.g., new strains of coronavirus that produce SARS) or because they can produce levels of secreted toxins that are lethal to uninfected bystander cells while the infected host cells (that express high levels of anti-apoptotic proteins) can survive (e.g., new strains of HIV that produce AIDS). Resistance to apoptosis also facilitates cell fusion and cell-to-cell spread of pathogens [11].",

This is particularly true in cases where it has proved impossible to develop safe and effective vaccines against the parasite itself. But, care must be taken because some parasites (e.g., HIV) have become lethal because their enhanced resistance to apoptosis allows them to survive while spreading extra-cellular toxins especially some that kill (normal, unprotected) bystander cells by inducing apoptosis. General suppression of the anti-apoptotic proteins in all cells might cause slaughter of the bystander cells before the cells hosting the virus could be killed, unless intracellular toxins can be neutralized or nullified first.",

G3139 is an \u201cantisense\u201d drug that has been shown to reduce Bcl-2 protein levels in vivo with minimal side effects [15]. Moreover, G3139 is an antisense ODN with unmethylated CpG units, which induce normal T-cells to resist apoptosis by up-regulating c-FLIP and Bcl-x(L), while having little effect on Bcl-2 [16], [17]. It is relevant that Bcl-2 only protects cells against apoptosis from internal stress, but Bcl-x(L) has a distinct function in protecting cells against external death signals such as TRAIL [18]. Verthelyi et al. [19] have advocated using unmethylated-CpG ODNs in HIV-1 infected individuals to protect against secondary infections.

It is understood that HIV inhabits certain host T-cells and the infected cells release pro-apoptotic toxins that induce extensive apoptosis in bystander cells (other T-cells and cells of other tissues). This phenomenon is not unlike the release of toxic NO (nitric oxide) by immune cells to fight infection and there may actually have been a symbiotic arrangement between the humans (primates) and the virus (HIV) to fight off malaria [20], [21], [22] and other tropical diseases [23], [24], [25]. (Although this may seem like an extreme adaptation, remember that sickle cell mutation, which produces a sever disease, apparently has been retained in the gene pool because of its ability to defeat malaria.) Originally, the population of HIV infected T-cells was kept in check by the fact that they were also susceptible to the pro-apoptotic proteins they secreted. However, the infected host cells carried just enough anti-apoptotic protein to protect themselves while attacking cells (especially liver cells) hosting other parasites.",
