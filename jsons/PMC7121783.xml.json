Viral particles consist of either an RNA or DNA genome surrounded by a protein capsid which protects the genetic material. Certain viruses are additionally enveloped by a lipid bilayer derived from host membranes. In order to propagate, viruses must use host cell systems to assemble new RNA, DNA, proteins and lipid envelopes. Though details of viral life cycles vary from virus to virus, there are five general stages: cell entry, translation of viral proteins, replication of the genome, assembly of the viral particle and egress from the cell (Fig. 1). Activity-based profiling has been used broadly to characterise host\u2013virus interactions. The approaches used and the discoveries of these techniques accorded will be highlighted herein.\n",

These need to be diverted from the host cell\u2019s systems and into pathways and processes needed by the virus. It is important to note that metabolic energy is consumed not only by the synthesis of new viral particles, but also by the remodelling of the cellular environment to meet the demands of the virus. Viruses require specific and often tightly regulated conditions to propagate efficiently. A good example lies in the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses, which occurs within specialised regions called replication organelles (RO) (Neufeldt et al. 2018). These organelles create an optimal environment for replication, allowing the concentration of the required host and viral factors and shielding viral RNA from the innate immune response (Neufeldt et al. 2018). The morphology of these organelles differs from virus to virus: they can be spherical or tubular, originate from the ER, Golgi body, endosome or lysosome, and be composed of single, double or multi-membrane vesicles (Novoa et al. 2005; Neufeldt et al. 2018). These membranes furthermore possess specific lipid profiles unique to each virus. The Rubella virus RO requires elevated saturated fatty acid levels, while West Nile virus, hepatitis C virus and enteroviruses require high cholesterol (Harak and Lohmann 2015; Paul and Bartenschlager 2015). The hepatitis C RO also requires elevated levels of sphingolipids and phosphorylated phosphoinosides (PIPs) (Hsu et al. 2010; Harak and Lohmann 2015; Paul and Bartenschlager 2015). The large amount of metabolic energy required to change the lipid profile of a cell in this manner necessitates significant perturbation of normal lipid homeostasis.",

Changes in host cell function, through changes in abundance and activity of key enzymes, can be induced by the virus as homeostatic responses to virus-induced changes as well as immunological responses to infection. Viral genomes can be extremely small: the hepatitis B virus, for example, has a genome 3.2 kb long (Liang 2009). As a result, viruses utilise the machinery of the cells they infect to replicate their own genome and assemble new viral particles for release and subsequent reinfection of new host cells.",

Interrogating changes to enzymatic activity during viral infection is therefore essential to form a complete understanding of the mechanisms of virus infection. Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) techniques (Barglow and Cravatt 2007; Cravatt et al. 2008) are ideally suited to answering questions on the perturbation of enzyme function by host\u2013virus interactions. These techniques use small molecule probes to covalently label active enzymes, while inactive enzymes remain unmodified. By including reporter tags in these probes, it is possible to quantitatively report differences in levels of active enzyme within complex proteomic samples.",

By comparing changes in protein expression and probe labelling, Nasheri et al. determined that FASN activity was significantly increased during HCV replication by increases both in protein expression and post-translational activation (Nasheri et al. 2013). Imaging of active FASN using the orlistat-alkyne probe demonstrated that HCV does not alter the localisation of FASN, indicating that the post-translational regulation of FASN occurs by another mechanism (Nasheri et al. 2013). Increased activity of FASN during HCV replication was further confirmed using probes containing a \u03b2-lactam warhead (Nasheri et al. 2014).",

To investigate the role of these interactions in the post-translational regulation of PI4KB activity, Desrochers et al. synthesised new PIKBPyne probes containing flexible linkers of varying length between the targeting PIK93 moiety and the crosslinking benzophenone (Desrochers et al. 2018). These flexible-linker PIKBPyne probes were shown to be able to label proteins interacting with active PI4KB. Labelling with PIKBPyne demonstrated an HCV-induced decrease in the interaction between PI4KB and the Golgi-resident protein ACBD3 (Desrochers et al. 2018). It had previously been reported that HCV induced a change in the localisation of PI4KB from the Golgi towards sites of viral replication (Zhang et al. 2012). This finding suggests that the upregulation of PI4P levels in the membranous web during HCV replication may occur partially through the disruption PI4KB\u2013ACBD3 interaction, allowing the relocalisation of PI4KB.",

CES1 activity has been shown to play a role in decreasing the levels of intracellular cholesteryl ester, as well as the secretion of intracellular triglycerides by the VLDL pathway (Zhao et al. 2007; Ross et al. 2010). It has furthermore been demonstrated that CES1 activity is not always correlated to its expression, suggesting that the regulation of CES1 function relies on post-translational modifications and interactions (Ross et al. 2010). Activity-based labelling is therefore ideally suited for interrogating the function of CES1. Both fluorophosphonate and the peptide-based probes demonstrated significantly increased activity during HCV replication, suggesting that CES1 is activated as part of the host cell\u2019s antiviral strategy to counteract the virally induced increases in cholesterol and triglycerides (Blais et al. 2010a, b).",

Many signalling pathways rely on kinase activity, and profiling kinase activity therefore has the potential to provide information on the regulation of multiple cell systems and pathways. The probe wortmannin-yne, based on the irreversible kinase inhibitor wortmannin, was designed to be able to broadly profile kinase activity (Desrochers et al. 2015). Comparison of labelling by wortmannin-yne in cells replicating HCV and in na\u00efve cells identified multiple regulatory kinases whose catalytic activity was altered by HCV. Kinases in the MAPK pathway, in particular, displayed significant decreases (Desrochers et al. 2015). This study confirmed previous reports of HCV-mediated decreases in MAPK signalling and demonstrates how ABPs can be used to profile kinase activity.",

These probes are designed to report on the activity of caspaces, enzymes essential to the progression of apoptosis (Furman et al. 2009). Using these probes, Furman et al. determined that norovirus infection induces apoptosis, as demonstrated by the significant increase in caspace activity. Mass spectrometry analysis of enzymes labelled by these probes revealed that they are equally capable of reporting on the activity of the cysteine protease cathepsin B. It was shown that cathepsin B is activated during norovirus infection and acts as an upstream activator of the apoptotic pathway (Furman et al. 2009).",

Activation of anti-apoptotic genes was also demonstrated during infection of Dengue virus, a close relative of HCV. Novel ATP-based probes containing acyl phosphate warheads were used to profile the activity of kinases during Dengue infection (Vetter et al. 2012). The activity of DNA-dependant protein kinase (DNA-PK), an anti-apoptotic enzyme which recognises and repairs DNA double-stranded breaks, was shown to be significantly upregulated by Dengue infection (Vetter et al. 2012).

A specialised form of the proteasome, the immunoproteasome, consists of many of the same regulatory subunits in addition to three variant catalytic subunits found only in the immunoproteasome (Ferrington and Gregerson 2012). This specialised form of the proteasome plays a role in directing the activity of the adaptive immune system. It is induced during infection and generates peptides with a hydrophobic C-terminus for cell-surface display in MHC class I molecules. CD8 T cells surveil these peptides and propagate an immune response upon recognition of foreign material (Ferrington and Gregerson 2012). The existence of mixed proteasomes, containing both the constitutively expressed and immunoproteasome subunits, has also been demonstrated, indicating that both categories of catalytic subunits could be implicated in immune response (Kammerl and Meiners 2016).",

Viral targeting of proteasomal activity could therefore be a potential immune evasion strategy. Recently, Nasheri et al. used a \u03b2-lactone-based activity-based probe, orlistat-alkyne, to label active proteasome subunits and thereby interrogate proteasome activity during hepatitis C virus infection (Nasheri et al. 2015). It was shown that the activity of multiple members of the proteasome system displayed decreased activity in HCV infected cells. PSMB5, which displays broad specificity and chymotrypsin-like hydrolase activity (Marques et al. 2009), PSMC6, an ATPase which regulates proteasome activity (Coux et al. 1996), and two immunoproteasomal subunits, PSME1, and PSME2 (de Graaf et al. 2011) were down-regulated between 40 and 80% (Nasheri et al. 2015). Interestingly, changes to protein expression did not match the observed changes in enzymatic activity (Nasheri et al. 2015). Altogether, this suggests that HCV targets proteasomal degradation by altering both protein expression and post-translational regulation as part of its efforts to evade the immune response. Furthermore, this study highlights the advantages of activity-based protein profiling in addition to traditional proteomics to study virally induced perturbation of host cell systems.",

The signalling cascade which is responsible for the activation of NF\u03baB during infection relies in great part on the ubiquitination of key signal transducers (Wertz and Dixit 2010). The auto-ubiquitination of the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 promotes the activity of the TAK1 kinase (Wertz and Dixit 2010). The I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex is then activated via TAK1-mediated phosphorylation and TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination (Wertz and Dixit 2010; van Gent et al. 2014). IKK phosphorylation of I\u03baB results in its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Oeckinghaus and Ghosh 2009). NF\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by I\u03baB; upon its degradation, NF\u03baB translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of antiviral, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes (Oeckinghaus and Ghosh 2009).",

Herpesviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses and have been shown to modulate the immune response via multiple different mechanisms (Cruz-Mu\u00f1oz and Fuentes-Panan\u00e1 2017). Using the HAUb-VME probe, Ovaa et al. labelled active host cell deubiquitinating enzymes and identified multiple DUBs whose activity was increased during infection: UCH-L3, USP-15, UCH-L1, UCH37, USP7 and USP9X. Several of these enzymes have been shown to regulate the NF\u03baB pathway. USP15 negatively regulates NF\u03baB activation by deubiquitinating I\u03baB (Harhaj and Dixit 2011), while USP7 decreases NFkB signalling by deubiquitinating TRAF6 and IKK (Nanduri et al. 2013). On the contrary, USP37 has been shown to be required for I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation and therefore NFkB activity (Mazumdar et al. 2010). Altogether, Ovaa et al. demonstrated that the herpesvirus EBV differentially regulates DUBs implicated in the regulation of the innate immune response, suggesting that this may be a pro-viral immune evasion mechanism.",

It was later shown that BPFL1 acts similarly to HHV-1\u2019s UL36, inhibiting the activation of NF\u03baB by catalysing the removal of ubiquitin from the sequestering protein I\u03baB\u03b1 (van Gent et al. 2014). It has furthermore been demonstrated that BPLF1 exerts additional control over the NF\u03baB pathway, deubiquitinating both TRAF6 and subunits of IKK, and thereby inhibiting the propagation of TLR signalling and the resultant activation of NF\u03baB (Saito et al. 2013; van Gent et al. 2014).

            "text": "Assigning novel functionalities is one of the more well-known uses of ABPP, and an essential primary step in characterising poorly understood enzymes which opens up further avenues of investigation. Contextualisation of the reactivity of an enzyme enables the determination of its specific targets. The ubiquitin chains targeted by the DUBs discussed in this section are linked to each other by one of the seven different linkage sub-types, corresponding to the location of the lysine residue to which the next ubiquitin is bound: Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48 and Lys63. New diUb-VME probes were developed containing two ubiquitin moieties conjugated by one of the seven possible linkage types, thereby allowing the determination of DUB\u2019s linkage specificity (Mulder et al. 2014). These probes were used to interrogate the substrate specificity of the SARS coronavirus papain-like protease (PLPro), a deubiquitinating enzyme, thought to play a role in innate immune evasion (B\u00e9k\u00e9s et al. 2016). The structural basis of PLPro\u2019s specificity was determined by co-crystalising it in conjunction with a diUb-VME probe. Co-crystalisation of enzymes with their substrates is often challenging, as the enzyme will catalyse the substrate and release the products. Using a substrate-mimetic ABP ensures that it is retained within the active site, preserving the interactions which give rise to specificity as well as the active conformation of the enzyme. This showed that PLpro interacts with the two ubiquitin moieties, but has few interactions with the interface between the two (B\u00e9k\u00e9s et al. 2016). This suggests that specificity originates from the orientation of the ubiquitin proteins in the S1 and S2 pockets, and not from recognition of the linkage itself. Screening with a panel of Ub-VME probes containing mono-Ub or di-Ub and possessing different linkage types demonstrated that PLpro possessed a similarly low labelling efficiency for mono-Ub and most di-Ub probes (B\u00e9k\u00e9s et al. 2016). This lends further support to the idea that interactions with a properly oriented S2 ubiquitin stabilise the enzyme-substrate complex and contribute to the specificity of SARS PLpro.",

These systems are regulated in part by Rab GTPases, host cell enzymes which play an important role in trafficking throughout the cell (Hutagalung and Novick 2011) and which have been implicated in the egress of multiple viruses (Hogue et al. 2014; Pohl et al. 2016; Takacs et al. 2017). Rab11 has been shown to be essential for the trafficking of IAV RNA from the perinuclear region to the plasma membrane (Pohl et al. 2016). Another Rab protein, Rab1, has been proposed to mediate transport of nascent HCV virions from the ER to the Golgi (Takacs et al. 2017). Rab proteins have also been shown to play a role in DNA virus egress in the case of herpesviruses (Hogue et al. 2014). Altogether, this suggests that Rab GTPase activity could be an interesting target for activity-based profiling during viral infection.",

HCV provides a good example of this, as its egress relies on the very-low-density-lipoparticle (VLDL) secretory pathway to release the mature virus particle into the bloodstream (Neufeldt et al. 2018). Certain VLDL-associated enzymes, such as the triglyceride-recruiting enzyme ABHD5 or the phospholipid synthesis enzyme LPCAT1, have been identified as pro- or antiviral HCV host factors. However, the interactions between these enzymes and HCV are not fully understood (Vieyres et al. 2016; Beilstein et al. 2017). Profiling enzymes which regulate this pathway could therefore reveal novel information clarifying how it is hijacked by HCV. Even viruses such as influenza, which do not rely on a lipid secretory pathway, still alter the cell\u2019s lipid profile in order to exit into the bloodstream (Pohl et al. 2016). Influenza virus egress occurs by budding from the plasma membrane, a process requiring an altered membrane lipid composition (Pohl et al. 2016). Profiling changes to lipid regulatory networks during the assembly and egress of virions could therefore yield new information and improve our understanding of host\u2013virus interactions during late stages of infection.",

They demonstrated that this probe was able to specifically label neuraminidases and could be used to detect neuraminidase activity. Of particular interest in this study was a demonstration of a more uncommon application of activity-based probes for isolation of viral particles. Immobilised probe bound to NA enzymes present on the particle surface, thereby enabling the isolation of the entire virion (Lu et al. 2005). While this probe was able a covalently label IAV NA, there were several limitations. Its large size and multiple rings necessitated millimolar concentrations to label even purified protein. The probe was also unable to penetrate cell membranes, which precluded the application of this probe in complex systems. Lastly, though the sialic acid did convey some selectivity, the difluoromethyl phenyl warhead nevertheless reacted non-specifically with multiple targets in a complex environment (Tsai et al. 2013).",

Instead of the inclusion of a separate warhead group in addition to the sialic acid moiety, the sialic acid sugar was modified to include fluorine at C2 and C3, displacing a hydroxyl group and a hydrogen, respectively. The electron-withdrawing property of the fluorines transforms the probe into an irreversible mechanism-based inhibitor. Two probes were made: DFSA and an ester-protected probe, PDFSA, both containing the sialic acid warhead and an alkyne handle (Fig. 3e) (Tsai et al. 2013). PDFSA is able to label NA in situ at micromolar concentrations, allowing imaging of sub-cellular localisation of the viral enzyme during infection (Tsai et al. 2013). PDFSA was able to label wild-type NA as well as mutant NA resistant to active-site antivirals, indicating that this probe could be applied to screen for the presence of drug-resistant strains by competitive ABPP (Tsai et al. 2013).",

The Zika virus, like most positive-strand RNA viruses, encodes a serine protease, NS3, which cleaves the precursor polyprotein into the mature viral proteins. As activity of the NS3 protease is essential to the establishment of a productive infection, the development of tools capable of characterising its activity and regulation is of great interest.",

While it is possible to design activity-based probes based on these sequences, these probes risk lacking specificity to individual proteases due to the overlapping substrate specificity of closely related enzymes. Recently, this problem was addressed by using unnatural amino acids to expand the chemical space of their peptides\u2019 building blocks. The Hybrid Combinatorial Substrate Library (HyCoSuL) uses 102 unnatural amino acids in addition to the twenty canonical ones to build optimal substrates containing a variable 4-amino acid sequence targeting the S1\u2013S4 pockets of the protease active site (Kasperkiewicz et al. 2014). To allow specific activity-based labelling, a fluorogenic coumarin and a diphenyl phosphate warhead are added (Kasperkiewicz et al. 2014). This library has previously been used to design probes targeting human proteases (Kasperkiewicz et al. 2015; Poreba et al. 2016, 2018). Recently, the HyCoSuL methodology was applied to design a probe, WRPK3, which rapidly labels Zika\u2019s NS3 protease at low nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 3f) (Rut et al. 2017). This probe has the potential to be applied to interrogate NS3 activity during Zika infection. These studies demonstrate a useful application of unnatural amino acids which has the potential to be used to design activity-based probes against other viral proteases.",

While this has been able to provide information on targets of viral mediation of host cell systems, the physiological relevance of this information has been subject to some doubt. Cell lysis and protein isolation procedures used in in vitro labelling have the potential to destroy enzyme-cofactor interactions which may result in loss of information about the enzyme\u2019s true activity in vivo. Labelling cells in situ preserves the regulation of catalytic activity present in living cells; however, they do not always accurately represent the effects of infection on a live organism.
