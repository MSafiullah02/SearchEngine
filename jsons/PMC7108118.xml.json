We identified 4 generations of in-hospital transmission, obviously with decreasing number of newly infected cases (transmissibility index) in each next higher generation. This was slightly more than what has been described in previous outbreaks but still within the expected range considering the size of our outbreak. In fact, secondary and tertiary cases have been reported in community clusters and hospital outbreaks in Saudi Arabia [2, 11]. Moreover, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary in-hospital transmissions were reported in the Korean outbreak [9]. A recent risk assessment of MERS-CoV cases from the Korean and Middle East outbreaks estimated the risks of having secondary, tertiary, quaternary, quinary, and beyond quinary hospital transmission at 22.7%, 10.5%, 6.1%, 3.9%, and 2%, respectively [12]. In the current outbreak, tertiary, quaternary, and quinary generations represented 24%, 13%, and 3% of all hospital-acquired transmissions. It appeared that the longer the delay in interrupting the chain of transmission through proper infection control measures, the more generations of transmission will take place [9].",

Additionally, it is not uncommon that very few community-acquired cases can lead to a major outbreak [1, 14]. Before the outbreak, a seroprevalence study projected that 0.15% of the community in Saudi Arabia has been exposed to the virus [15].

For example, in the largest single hospital cluster in the 2015 Korean MERS-CoV outbreak, 81 (89%) of the 91 HAI cases were infected in the ED [17]. Overcrowded healthcare facilities, particularly EDs, were identified as a major cause for MERS-CoV outbreaks, which by default means poor compliance with infection control practices [4, 7, 18].",
