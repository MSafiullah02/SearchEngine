Whether specific viruses or the classical clinical risk factors are more important in determining severe bronchiolitis is not well established. Aim: To analyze the specific viruses and clinical variables that can predict severe bronchiolitis at admission. Methods: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were prospectively collected from 484 children <12 months admitted to the pediatrics ward or PICU at Universitary Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9 u (Barcelona, Spain) for bronchiolitis from October 2007 to October 2008. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Sixteen respiratory viruses were studied using PCR. Severity was assessed with a bronchiolitis clinical score (BCS). Results: Four hundred ten infants that tested positive for respiratory viruses were analyzed. Mixed viral infections did not increase the severity of the disease. Rhinovirus was associated with severe BCS in univariate analysis (P \u00bc 0.041), but in the multivariate logistic regression including viruses and clinical data only bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR 7.2; 95% CI 1.2-43.3), congenital heart disease (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.1-19.9), prematurity (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.3-5.1), and fever (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.1) showed statistical significance for predicting severe BCS. Conclusions: Classical clinical risk factors have more weight in predicting a severe BCS in infants with acute bronchiolitis than the involved viruses.",

HRV, the most prevalent cause of upper respiratory infection in older children and adults, is increasingly recognized as an important agent causing acute bronchiolitis. Its role in the development of acute respiratory tract infection is controversial because it can be detected in up to 15% of asymptomatic individuals. 12 Moreover, it is associated with a more severe course of the disease. 13 In addition, viral coinfections have also been related with severe bronchiolitis. 9, 14, 15 Whether the traditional clinical risk factors or data concerning infection by specific viruses have more weight in the development of a severe course in infants affected by acute bronchiolitis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical factors and the viruses involved in cases of severe bronchiolitis, defining severity according to the respiratory burden using a bronchiolitis clinical score (BCS).

A set of primers and probe for HBoV specific to the NS-1 gene (forward primer: 5 0 -TGCACTGATTGCGGTGGTT-3 0 ; reverse primer: 5 0 -TGCGCGATCAGTGTACATAGAA-3 0 ; probe: 5 0 -(VIC)-CCTTCCTCATAGTGCTGAC-(MGB)-3 0 ) was designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sets of primers and probes specific to the fusion gene of both subtypes of HPMV previously described 24 were used, labeled with 5 0 -(6-FAM) and 3 0 -MGB. The real-time RT-PCR reactions were carried out using the Mx3000P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).",

This study analyses, for the first time, the relative importance of clinical and virological data in predicting bronchiolitis outcome. Our results show that, in our environment, the clinical data obtained at admission are more relevant than the specific infecting virus in determining the risk of severe disease. The strength of this study is that we prospectively enrolled only hospitalized infants less than 12 months of age with a first acute episode of bronchiolitis, excluding all the patients with recurrent wheezing, whereas other studies retrospectively investigated the results of virological examinations in patients of different ages and with various respiratory diseases. 25 We also studied all the significant respiratory viruses that are currently associated with bronchiolitis. As a result, our study offers a homogeneous and well-characterized cohort to examine the natural history and risk factors of acute bronchiolitis. Some studies have defined severity according to the need for PICU admission. 9, 14, 15 Because PICU admission criteria can differ between centers (according individual practice guidelines or PICU availability), we analyzed severity based on BCS, a reproducible clinical score which allows classification of the patients according to the respiratory findings on physical examination and oxygen saturation, reflecting the severity in terms of respiratory burden. This BCS correlates with other variables involved with severity such as the length of stay, need for supplementary oxygen, and need for PICU admission and respiratory support. In the univariate logistic regression analysis, HRV was the only virus found to be a risk factor for severe BCS in acute bronchiolitis. This finding is in accordance with the report of Papadopoulos et al., 13 in which the presence of HRV in infants with bronchiolitis was found to increase by 5.6-fold the risk for severe disease (defined by a clinical score at admission above the 50th percentile). Other reports have also described HRV as an important pathogen in the lower respiratory tract, implicated in severe respiratory distress in children with underlying chronic conditions 26 and significantly associated with an increase in the rate of hospitalizations, especially in patients with a history of wheezing or asthma. 27 In our series the proportion of ex-preterm and infants with underlying chronic illness is lower in HRSV bronchiolitis than in bronchiolitis caused by other viruses, which is in accordance with previous studies that described how the majority of children with HRSV infection in developed countries had no underlying medical conditions. 28, 29 The high palivizumab prophylaxis rate in our environment could play a role in the lower hospitalization rate for HRSV bronchiolitis in high-risk infants. 30 Some studies have reported an increased risk for severe bronchiolitis in dual viral infection, 9, 14, 15 or even in some specific viral infections such as HRSV-HMPV coinfection. [31] [32] [33] Our results are in accordance with other series that did not find an increase in severity in patients with viral coinfections. [34] [35] [36] [37] Moreover, the high frequency of viral coinfections in our study, as also found in previous works, indicates that infection with multiple viruses in infants is a common situation that does not change the clinical course of bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "The multivariate logistic regression model showed that BPD was the strongest predictor of severe score, followed by hemodynamically significant CHD and prematurity, all well-known risk factors for severe HRSV bronchiolitis according to previous reports. 3, 10, 38, 39 The last predictor in our analysis was fever at admission, which was significantly associated with X-ray infiltrates in our series. This finding has also been described in previous works, where pulmonary consolidation on chest X-ray was associated with severe disease and need for respiratory support, 3 even in previously healthy infants. 40 Most of the studies regarding risk factors for severe bronchiolitis have been conducted in children infected by HRSV, but to our knowledge no studies have analyzed the risk factors for all patients with bronchiolitis and the relative importance of viruses and traditional risk factors. With our results an interesting conclusion can be drawn, which is that, beside the implicated virus, the classical risk factors for HRSV bronchiolitis can be extended to include bronchiolitis caused by other viruses. This observation is important in planning protocols for bronchiolitis management; although palivizumab prophylaxis is administered to high-risk patients for severe HRSV bronchiolitis, most of them continue to be at risk for severe bronchiolitis from other viruses. Efforts to educate caretakers on how to prevent viral infections in high-risk patients should continue, especially where moderate preterms, infants with BPD and CHD are concerned. Additionally, HRV should be taken into account. In our area, where universal HRSV prophylaxis for high-risk patients HRV is associated with severe cases when clinical factors are not considered, routine screening for HRV at admission may be proposed in order to identify infants at risk for severe disease and to separate the hospitalized patients into cohorts so as to avoid nosocomial infection.",

Severity of infection by a virus can fluctuate in different seasons, as can the pattern of circulating viruses in the community, which may explain the differences in severity by specific viruses found in this and other reports. Also, the high palivizumab prophylaxis rate in our population probably leads to underestimation of the role of HRSV in high-risk infants. Another limitation is that BCS is not yet a validated instrument for bronchiolitis scoring. Nevertheless, none of the available scoring systems for bronchiolitis has been validated neither has all tests characteristics studied (reliability, responsiveness, reproducibility). BCS is implemented in the daily clinical practice in our institution for 15 years and shows good correlation with other outcomes of severity (length of hospital stay, days of oxygen therapy and of nasogastric feeding tub, FiO 2 , greater PICU admission and need for respiratory support). The use of different bronchiolitis scoring systems is a common limitation of most articles in this field because it difficults to compare with other studies.",
