This feature can be attributed to a large extent to the global basic charge of enteric Ad virions and to the stability of Ad41 fiber, a viral protein mediating virus attachment. Upon exposure to pH shock, the respiratory Ad2 loses its ability to interact with lipids while enteric Ad41 still binds to the major phospholipids of gastric and intestine mucus. In addition, contrary to respiratory Ad, enteric Ad41 interacts with several sphingolipid components of plasma membranes.

Approximately 87% of the Ad particle mass consists of proteins (Green and Pina, 1963) . It is thus reasonable to assume that the charge difference of some Ad proteins is reflected in the charge of the whole virus particle. Indeed, the particle migration varied when the mobility of different Ad serotypes is compared on native gel (Fig. 2) . While serotypes 2, 3, and 5 migrate towards the anode, Ad41 remained in the wells. The quality of virus preparations was checked by EM, and no aggregation has been noticed (results not shown). Acid treatment did not seem to affect virus mobility (compare a with b in Fig. 2 ), suggesting that virions were not disassembled. Under non-denaturing conditions, the mobility on native gel depends on the size, the shape (form), and the charge of the migrating entity. The organization and form of Ad virions are quite similar, and the serotypes differ only slightly in their DNA content; for example, Ad2 DNA contains 35 937 bases (Roberts et al., 1984) whereas Ad40 DNA contains 34 214 bases (Davison et al., 1993) .

We used 293 cells as they are permissive for both Ad41 and Ad2 and conventionally used for Ad41 production. To establish the experimental conditions for the infectivity assessment, at the beginning we obtained a curve of infection using increasing virus quantities for the same amounts of attached cells as described by Favier et al. (2002) . From this we estimated the virus amount giving the maximum (saturation) of infection as well as giving 50% of maximum infection. For each virus infection, two sets of condition were used, 50% and nearly 100% of infectivity saturation, and progeny production was measured after viral inoculum has been exposed to buffered HCl.

Therefore, similar to studies on rotavirus acid stability (Weiss and Clark, 1985) , short pH exposure was performed. Such exposure, in contrast with long dialysis at pH 6.4 -6.8 (Pereira and Wrigley, 1974; van Oostrum and Burnett, 1985) , does not result in Ad vertex removal. Because acid secretion by gastric parietal cells reduces the intraluminal pH to about 2.0 in adults and to about 4.0 in children (Gryboski and Walker, 1983) , both conditions were employed (Fig. 3) . The scatter of results is typical for this kind of experiments; therefore, 33 experiments have been carried out after acid exposure. In about half of the experiments, the Ad41 infectivity was not affected by acid exposure compared to virus diluted in culture medium. Interestingly, in 17 cases out of 33, the infectivity of Ad41 increased. However, at the same time the infectivity of Ad2 was inhibited by acid exposure, with a negligible activation observed in three cases out of 33. On average, the Ad41 infectivity was unchanged, whereas Ad2 infectivity decreased by 20%. No notable difference was observed for pH 2 versus pH 4 or at room temperature (RT) versus 37 jC, in contrast with the results obtained for another enteric virus, rotavirus. For this virus, acid resistance was significantly higher at pH 4 than at pH 2 and at RT than at 37 jC (Weiss and Clark, 1985) .

Native fibers and pentons were purified from cells infected with wild-type viruses. Because we had to use the pentons for Ad41 (see explanation above), the penton was also used for Ad5 (P5). The fibers were revealed with antibody. Initial proper folding of fibers was verified by the presence of the trimeric forms.

PC, DPPC, PE, and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with Ad2 and Ad41 in comparable molar amounts. It should be noted that the assay sensitivity was ensured by the amount of the immobilized lipid being in the pmol range (Thomas et al., 2001) . Before acid treatment, at both binding conditions used, Ad2 attached to DPPC, whereas Ad41 attached to DPPC only at pH 6, additionally attaching strongly to DPPG (Fig. 6) . To simulate the abrupt pH jump induced by the passage from stomach to intestine, both viruses were exposed to pH 2 for 1 min at 37 jC, then brought up to pH 7.5 and incubated with immobilized lipids. Contrary to the untreated Ad2 case, no lipid interaction was observed after Ad2 was exposed to a pH shock (Fig. 6) . Most interestingly, pH shock of enteric Ad41 confirmed its interaction with DPPC and DPPG and improved its interaction with two other phospholipids. The loss of the lipid interaction by Ad2 can be explained by the changes in virus integrity induced by acid treatment, as it has been illustrated by the decrease in infectivity and in fiber stability (Figs. 3 and 5) . In the case of Ad41, there is no loss of infectivity upon acid treatment, which would suggest the conservation of virion integrity.

The charge distribution on the head domain of fibers of different serotypes (Fig. 1) shows the presence of clusters of basic amino acids for the Ad41 fibers and the more positive global charge related to the higher pI of these head domains (Table 1 ) This positive surface potential is particularly pronounced for the Ad41 long fiber. Furthermore, Ad41 mobility observed during electrophoresis under native conditions indicated a much more basic charge of enteric virions than other Ad serotypes (Fig. 2) . This feature immediately suggested that upon encountering stomach acidic conditions, the protonation of basic Ad41 particle would be much less damaging to the virion integrity than for the significantly less basic respiratory Ad2 or Ad5. Indeed, acid treatment significantly impaired Ad2 infectivity whereas Ad41 viability was not affected by the acid (Fig. 3) . Because all mucosa possess an enzymatic barrier composed primarily of proteolytic enzymes (Zhou and Li Wan Po, 1994) , we analyzed the proteolytic resistance of Ad41 fibers, viral proteins mediating cell attachment. Contrary to the fiber of the respiratory serotype, Ad41 fibers were not digested by chymotrypsin after acid exposure (Fig. 5) . This tends to show that Ad41 survival in the acid stomach environment stems from the pronounced basic character of the enteric Ad particle, and in particular, from the remarkable stability of its fibers, which under acidic stomach conditions would likely retain, in the presence of proteolytic enzymes, the ability to attach to the host cells. Some viruses (e.g., rotaviruses) have evolved so that proteolytic processing facilitates viral infection. Our results strongly suggest that enteric adenoviruses use another adaptation mechanism, which is the prevalence of basic charge of the virions.
