            "text": "Similar to most mammalian cell lines, activation of the interferon response in most chicken cells is characterized by upregulation of Ifn\u03b2. Like the human genome, the chicken genome encodes only one copy of the Ifn\u03b2 gene, whereas at least ten isoforms of Ifn\u03b1 are present [4, 5]. Similar to mammals, production of chicken IFN\u03b1 is mainly mediated by monocytes; other cells mainly produce IFN\u03b2 in response to viral infection [6]. Because avian coronaviruses replicate mainly in epithelial cells, we monitor activation of the type I interferon response by quantification of Ifn\u03b2. Similar to mammalian cells, Ifn\u03b2 is upregulated upon activation of either TLR or Rig-I like receptors (RLRs), but not in response to stimulation with IFN. Concomitant with Ifn\u03b2, many ISGs are also upregulated, indicating that the term interferon stimulated genes is somewhat misleading [7]. Studying the expression of ISGs can be useful, therefore we have provided a list of avian-specific primers for use in real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR; Table 1) [8\u201310]. Protocols for RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR are plenty and every lab has its own protocols. In this chapter we describe briefly the methods used in our lab. For a detailed overview of RT-qPCR techniques and theoretical background, please refer to Forlenza et al. [11].\n",

It is advised to ensure that the reference gene selected is stable under the conditions of each experiment by performing stability analysis. When the mRNA level of the reference gene is not stable during the experimental procedure, such as during prolonged infection with a virus, we use an external reference gene for normalization. The external reference gene we use is luciferase, which is added as mRNA (commercially available) to the RLT lysis buffer (1 ng/sample) prior to RNA isolation and cell lysis. This guarantees that the external reference RNA and the host RNA are subject to the same treatment prior to cDNA synthesis.To calculate the fold change of IBV total RNA, Ct deviation is calculated versus a fixed Ct value (e.g., Ct = 30), because no IBV is present in the non-infected cells that are used as control in all the experiments.Interferon containing samples can be stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Storage at \u221220 \u00b0C ensures long time (>months) stability. One freeze\u2013thaw cycle can reduce the IFN-activity of a sample by 40 %. To avoid repeated freeze-thawing of samples, avoid measuring the same sample twice. To achieve this, ensure that at least one of the dilutions of the samples falls within the linear range of the standard curve.To select the appropriate dilutions it is advisable to perform a pilot experiment. One can either make an extensive twofold serial dilution series (for example, 2\u20131,024 times dilution), or use tenfold pre-dilutions. In our hands IFN production by avian cells rarely exceeds 5,000 U/ml, and therefore, a maximum of 1,000 times pre-dilution should suffice.Medium is removed simply by emptying the 96-well plate in the waste and gently tapping it dry on a stack of tissues. Sterility is not an issue, the cells will only be incubated for another 6 h.CEC-32 cells should not be allowed to dry out! Make sure you transfer the samples to the cells within minutes. Drying of the monolayer will decrease the luminescence and thereby negatively influence the assay. When transferring the diluted samples to 96-well plate with CEC-32 cells, start with the lowest concentration and work your way up the dilutions. In this way the same tips can be used for multiple dilutions. Do not forget to add medium to the negative controls.\n",
