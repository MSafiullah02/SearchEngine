            "text": "Biological Aging is a process driven by molecular damage, molecular heterogeneity, and metabolic imbalance which determinates increased susceptibility to diseases and impaired adaptation to changes in environmental conditions (Rattan 2016). Alterations in the immune functions play a fundamental role in aging. The term \u201c immunosenescence\u201d has been coined to describe the changes that occur with age in the immune system and that lead to a higher incidence of infection, cancer, and autoimmune disease (Fulop et al. 2010; Pawelec et al. 2014). Immunosenescence involves a shift in function of both adaptive and innate immune cells, which can be resumed in a reduced capacity to recognize new antigens and in the occurrence of systemic low-grade chronic inflammation. This phenomenon, termed \u201c inflamaging\u201d (Franceschi et al. 2000) is likely the result of immunosurveillance of chronic infections (chronic antigen stress) (Pawelec et al. 2014) combined with accumulating senescent cells which, in turn, are a rich source of pro-inflammatory factors collectively termed the \u201cSenescence-associated secretory phenotype\u201d (SASP) (Campisi 2014). In analogy with aging, immunosenescence in humans is very heterogeneous and can be described as a complex mosaic resulting from the interaction of a variety of environmental, stochastic, and genetic-epigenetic variables. It is likely that, through a favorable combination of these factors, centenarians avoid or delay the major inflammation-driven age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), Alzheimer disease (AD), and cancer (B\u00fcrkle et al. 2007) despite showing some markers of inflammation.",

Deficiencies of both macro- and micronutrients in aging is strictly related to global impairments of the immune functions and appearance of age-related diseases (Lesourd 2006). Several causes contribute to micronutrient deficiencies in elderly. First of all, the poor socioecon3omic condition present in a large part of old people may lead to a consumption of inexpensive foods deficient in micronutrients (Kant 2000). The gap is worsened by loss of appetite, lack of teeth, intestinal malabsorption, and subclinical diseases that lead to the final result of frailty, disability, and mortality (Semba et al. 2006). By contrast, changes in diet and exercise patterns appears to be effective in the prevention of late-onset nutrition-related conditions, especially when these are instituted early in life (Chernoff 2001).",

These two trace elements display a common pivotal role in establishing the cellular antioxidant response as well as in mounting a proper immune response, which in turn may be useful to prevent excessive accumulation of senescent cells in aging and to reduce the senescence-associated increase of chronic inflammatory mediators.",

            "text": "Zinc is one of the most important trace elements in the body, although its presence in nature does not exceed 0.02% (Mills 1989). The major characteristics of zinc include a highly concentrated charge, a small radius (0.65 A), no variable valence (low risk of free radical production), ready passage from one symmetry in its surroundings to another without exchange, rapid exchange of ligands (on and off reactions), and binding mostly to S- and N-donors in biological systems. These properties enable zinc to play a major biological role as a catalyst. Zinc is essential for the activity of more than 300 enzymes influencing the activity of zinc dependent antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and various organ functions having a secondary effect on the immune system (Rink and Gabriel 2000). Zinc is present in \u201czinc finger domains\u201d of transcription factors and in a multitude of proteins, peptides, enzymes, hormones, and cytokines, which act in maintaining body homeostasis (Coleman 1992; Berg and Shi 1996). Zinc also regulates mRNA stability (Taylor and Blackshear 1995) and extracellular matrix (Vallee and Falchuk 1993). Zinc binds enzymes, proteins, and peptides with different binding affinity (kd) ranging from 10\u22122 to 10\u221214 mol/l (Mocchegiani et al. 1998). Some of these enzymes may be activated by zinc, as for instance the thymic hormone named thymulin, which loses its activity in absence of zinc (Fabris et al. 1984), while others may be inactivated. Zinc also regulates cell cycle and apoptosis (Fraker 2005) with an optimal range of concentration that has been well defined by studies on genomic stability \u201cin vitro.\u201d",

The authors found that increasing dietary zinc levels decreased the mean and maximum life span of the worms, whereas treatment with a zinc-selective chelator increased their mean and maximum life span. The life span modulating effects were mediated by DAF-16, HSF-1, and SKN-1 proteins, which suggest the involvement of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway. These results are somewhat supporting the idea that zinc itself has a role as an antagonistic pleiotropy player (Kumar et al. 2016). By the way, it has been just recently hypothesized that reduced zinc levels in serum during human aging may reflect the homeostatic shade from a general systemic \u201cgrowth and reproduction\u201d status typical of juvenile age to a \u201crepair and maintenance\u201d status that evolved to preserve health status during old age (Malavolta et al. 2015).",

MT exist in different isoforms characterized by the length of amino acid chain: isoform I, II, III, e IV mapped on chromosome 16 in man and on chromosome 8 in mice with complex polymorphisms (West et al. 1990). The more common isoforms are I and II; the isoform III, also called growth inhibitory factor (GIF), is mostly expressed in brain tissues while the isoform IV is restricted in squamous epithelia. MT contain 20 cysteines which bind seven zinc atoms through mercaptide bonds that have the spectroscopy characteristics of metal thiolate clusters (Maret and Vallee 1998). The zinc/cysteine clusters are of two different types. In the beta-domain cluster, three bridging and six terminal cysteine thiolates provide a coordination environment that is identical for each of the three zinc atoms. In the alpha-domain clusters, there are two different zinc sites; two of them have one terminal ligand and three bridging ligands, respectively, while the other two have two terminal and two bridging ligands (Maret and Vallee 1998).",

The released free zinc ions are used to confer the biological activity to some zinc-dependent antioxidant enzymes and to other proteins involved in DNA repair, as well as to upregulate the gene expression of various factors involved in the antioxidant response (Mocchegiani et al. 2013). Hence, MT are able to transduce stress signals into free zinc ion signals which are immediately compensated by the activity of Zn transporters and subsequently downregulated by a feedback mechanism that involves the gene expression of MT themselves. This mechanism is also involved in regulation of nitric oxide (NO) pathways (Bogdan et al. 2000) as NO induces the release of zinc from MT, via S-nitrosylation (Zangger et al. 2001). The release of zinc by MT, via s-nitrosylation, contributing to raise the intracellular free zinc ions concentration, plays a crucial role in modulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and in the activation of immune cells (Rink and Haase 2007).

These findings clearly suggest the existence of a strong interplay between MT and the immune system. An important link between cytokines and MT seems to be STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) responsive element observed in the promoter of MT as well as the nitric oxide pathway. It is remarkable that cytokines reported to increase inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression (IL-1 and TNF-a) have also induced the expression of MT (Zangger et al. 2001). This induction is likely the indirect consequence of the release of free zinc from preexisting MT via S-nitrosylation caused by NO. This process is particularly important for the production of thymic hormone (thymulin) from thymic epithelial cells. Indeed, IL-1 induces thymic uptake of zinc (Coto et al. 1992), which is subsequently made available for the activity of thymulin by a process that involve the redox status of MT (Savino et al. 1984).",

In particular, there have been concerns around the possibility that MT may retain their protective role during chronic stress and inflammatory conditions associated with the major disease of aging (Mocchegiani et al. 2000a). In the case of cancer, for example, MT have been proven as an important barrier against carcinogenesis (Dziegiel et al. 2016; Malavolta et al. 2016) but, once malignant cells are formed these proteins may help cancer cells to survive and proliferate. Several studies have disclosed MT expression as a prognostic factor for tumor progression and drug resistance in a variety of cancers, including breast, prostatic, ovarian, head and neck, nonsmall cell lung cancer, melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma (Eckschlager et al. 2009; Dziegiel et al. 2016). This action is consistent with the original biological role of MT, as these proteins are part of the defensive intracellular stress response. Additionally, elevated levels of extracellular MT, as detected at sites of inflammation and in certain types of neoplastic lesions, have been shown to display an immunosuppressive function (Youn and Lynes 1999). By contrast, there are cases where MT have been found to provide additional benefit in chronic inflammation, especially in cancer therapy. Indeed, while cancer cells overexpressing MT appear in general less sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs, cancers where MT are progressively silenced are more sensitive to drugs following expression of specific MT isoforms in presence of zinc (Pedersen et al. 2009; Arriaga et al. 2014). These studies suggest that there is not a common role and that different MT isoforms might be differently associated with either chemoresistance or sensitivity to cancer drugs.",

            "text": "However, it has been more recently documented that MT expression declines with \u201cin vitro\u201d aging of PBMCs, thus suggesting that the low levels of MT observed in PBMCs of centenarians could simply be the consequence of the increasing accumulation of senescent cells in blood (Malavolta et al. 2008) or other phenomena related to epigenetic changes. Conversely, the increased levels of MT observed in PBMCs from elderly subjects could be the physiological consequence of a stress response induced by inflammatory agents. A general pro-longevity role of MT emerges also from recent studies in mice. A longevity phenotype has been shown in MT transgenic mice that overexpresses the MT-1 isoform (MT1-tg) in the C57BL/6 J background (Malavolta et al. 2012), as well as in cardiac-specific MT transgenic mice that overexpress the human MT2 isoform in the FVB background (Yang et al. 2006). More recently, the findings that MT KO mice display a shortened life span can be considered a definitive proof that constitutive MT expression from birth to death may play a beneficial role in longevity, at least in mice, independently by the strain studied (Kadota et al. 2015). However, it is still uncertain if this situation may be comparable in humans and, most importantly, there are no examples of MT-inducible mice models, which might unravel the consequence of reactivation of MT expression in late life. Anyway, association studies of SNPs of MT genes point out a role of these proteins in human longevity or in the susceptibility to age-related diseases but the functional role is far to be clarified (Giacconi et al. 2005; Cipriano et al. 2006). Taking inspiration from the role of MT in cancer, it should deserve appropriate consideration for future investigation the role of MT in cellular senescence. Currently, there is common agreement on the negative role of excessive accumulation of apoptosis-resistant senescent cells in aging and in several age-related diseases. This evidence is supported by the rejuvenating effects observed after inducible removal of senescent cells in transgenic animals (Baker et al. 2011, 2016) as well as after treatment of mice with senolytic drugs (Chang et al. 2016; Roos et al. 2016). While late passage senescent lymphocytes clones may display reduced expression of MT protein (Malavolta et al. 2008), some models of oncogene-induced senescence (Collado et al. 2005) and senescent endothelial cells (Malavolta et al. unpublished observation) appear to overexpress MT genes. In analogy with the role shown by MT in resistance to apoptosis of cancer cells, it might be possible to build the hypothesis that these proteins can play a role in the resistance to apoptosis of senescent cells. Investigation around this hypothesis might be important to optimize the development of senolytic drugs before human studies. ",

In agreement with this observation, a study performed in mice showed reduced Zip6 expression and dysregulation in splenocytes from aged mice (Wong et al. 2013). Most importantly, the age-specific Zip 6 dysregulation correlated with an increase in Zip6 promoter methylation while reduced Zip 6 expression was shown to enhance pro-inflammatory response. Similarly, a correlation between the level of methylation at SLC30A5 (ZnT5) promoter region and age has been reported in humans (Coneyworth et al. 2009).

Psychological stress, a putative recipe for accelerated aging, has been shown to induce zinc accumulation and upregulation of ZIP14 and metallothionein in rat liver (Tian et al. 2014). Since chronic inflammation, particularly driven by increased IL-6, is a usual event in old age (Mocchegiani et al. 2003), it cannot be excluded that this process may contribute to hypozincemia, depressed immune response, and risk of infection in the elderly.",

In fact, zinc inhibits LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 release from primary human monocytes and monocytic cell lines through the inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity (von Bulow et al. 2005), suggesting that zinc may display also some anti-inflammatory properties.",

The optimal concentration of zinc \u201cin vitro\u201d from genomic stability studies performed in different cellular models point out at concentrations in the range 4\u201316 \u03bcM (Sharif et al. 2011). It seems that both apoptosis prevention and induction are mediated by pathways involving zinc and/or zinc-dependent enzymes (Clegg et al. 2005; Wiseman et al. 2006). Therefore, the modulation of the zinc homeostasis plays a key role not only in preventing apoptosis, when oxidative stress is low, but also in inducing apoptosis, when oxidative stress and cellular damage is high. This mechanism could play a role, for example, in the elimination of virally infected or malignant cells (Fraker and Lill-Elghanian 2004). The pro-apoptotic function of zinc has been documented under condition of persistent oxidative damage in PBMC from young-adult humans as well as in very old age (Ostan et al. 2006). The key player that mediates the activity of zinc in this case appears to be the tumor suppressor p53, which needs zinc for site-specific DNA binding and proper transcriptional activation (Hainaut and Mann 2001; Loh 2010).",

            "text": "Old literature documented that zinc supplementation performed throughout the whole life span of rodents is able to delay some age-related cell-mediated immune modifications, such as the decreased circulating thymic hormone levels (Iwata et al. 1979). However, an immunomodulatory effect of Zn supplementation has been shown with a relatively short time of treatment in old mice. For example, 18 \u03bcg/ml Zn++ in the drinking water induced thymus regrowth and functionality (Dardenne et al. 1993; Mocchegiani et al. 1995) as well restoration of NK cell cytotoxicity (Mocchegiani et al. 1995) in old mice in just 1 month. That the benefit of zinc supplementation upon the immune functions in old mice is not to consider an epiphenomenon comes by the analysis of the rate of survival in old zinc-treated mice. Old mice (inbreed Balb/c mice) treated with daily zinc at the dose reported above in drinking water from the pre-senescent age (12\u201314 months of age) display a significant increment of the median and maximal life span (up to 33 months vs. 28\u201329 of controls) (Mocchegiani et al. 2000b). The increased longevity was largely due to significant decrements of deaths due to cancer and infection in the middle age. Part of the effects shown in aged mice can be the consequence of an improved thymopoiesis (Wong et al. 2009). However, increased longevity after zinc supplementation was also reported in the short lived thymectomized and nude mice, which display a negative crude balance of zinc (Mocchegiani et al. 2007). Taking into account that the liver extrathymic T cell pathway is prominent in nude, thymectomized and old mice (Abo et al. 2000), it is likely that these effects of zinc may be in part the effects of zinc on this extrathymic pathway (Mocchegiani et al. 1998). Conversely, in aged C57Bl/6 mice, zinc supplementation (300 mg/kg for 25 days) was shown to increase thymopoiesis, as assessed by increased total thymocyte numbers (Wong et al. 2009). The improved thymic output was mediated in part by reducing the age-related accumulation of immature CD4(\u2212)CD8(\u2212)CD44(+)CD25(\u2212) thymocytes, as well as by decreasing the expression of the thymosuppressive cytokine named stem cell factor. A slightly increased survival has been also recently documented in old (age \u226517 months) C57BL/6 J mice supplemented for the whole life span with 380 mg/L of zinc in drinking water. However, survival curves of supplemented mice displayed an increased variability and were markedly lower compared to those of transgenic mice overexpressing MT independently of zinc supplementation (Malavolta et al. 2012). The results of mice overexpressing MT are similar to those obtained in worms with zinc chelation (Kumar et al. 2016). These data may reinforce the idea that zinc has a potential antagonistic pleiotropic. In particular, zinc may act on nutrient-sensing pathways (e.g., insulin/IGF-1-like receptor pathway and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway) with the final result of promoting growth and proliferation. Inhibition of this pathway has been proposed as a pro- longevity treatment while its enhancement may help elderly, which in turn display excessive downregulation of nutrient-sensing pathways as a consequence of compensatory phenomena normally occurring in aging. This point of view could explain the beneficial effects observed by supplementation in elderly and old mice. ",

(1990) have reported no benefit exclusively for increased lymphocyte mitogen proliferative response (zinc dose = 15 mg/day for 1 year); Cakman et al. (1997) have found enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production by leukocytes (zinc dose = 15 mg/day for 45 days); Fortes et al. (1997) report an increased number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (zinc dose = 25 mg/day for 40 days). A long-term (6 months) supplementation trial with two doses of zinc (15 and 30 mg/day) in elderly was recently conducted by the Zenith study (Hodkinson et al. 2007). Zn supplementation of 30 mg/day significantly lowered B-lymphocyte at month 3 but not later. Zn supplementation of 15 mg/day significantly increased the ratio of CD4 to CD8 T lymphocytes at month 6. Overall, these findings suggest Zn supplementation has minimal long-term effects on immune status of healthy elderly persons. In the framework of a recent European study focused in zinc and immunosenescence, elderly subjects to be supplemented with zinc were chosen according to the presence of a pro-inflammatory genotype for IL-6 and low plasma zinc (Mocchegiani et al. 2008). Supplementation (with 10 mg/day of Zn-aspartate for 48+/\u22122 days) was carried out in 110 old subjects (age >65 years) who presented stable low plasma zinc levels (\u226410.5 \u03bcM at baseline and at 1 year follow-up) and in C- carriers for IL-6 -174G/C with unstable plasma zinc (\u226410.5 \u03bcM at baseline and >10.5 \u03bcM at 1 year follow-up). Most evident effects of zinc supplementation on immune system comprised both corrective, but also noncorrective effects on known immunosenescence markers, including: (1) an improved susceptibility of T cells to activation-induced cell death (AICD) (Varin et al. 2008); (2) an increased circulating levels of IL-6, MCP-1 associated with increased NK activity that were partly dependent on IL-6 -174G/C and +647 MT1a SNPs (Mariani et al. 2008); (3) an increase of TH1 and TH2 cells in thawed samples and a slight reduction in TH2/TH1 ratio in fresh whole blood lymphocytes (Uciechowski et al. 2008); (4) a marked increase in both basal as well as stress-induced Hsp70 levels in lymphocytes from healthy elderly donors with a higher impact on CD3+ cells (Putics et al. 2008); and (5) reduced spontaneous cytokine release in PBMCs and defects in termination of inflammatory activity (Kahmann et al. 2008). In the same population, Giacconi et al. (2015) studied the influence of ZIP2 Gln/Arg/Leu (rs2234632) polymorphism on zinc homeostasis and inflammatory response following zinc supplementation. Leu- (Arg43Arg genotype) elderly showed higher inflammatory markers at baseline than carriers of other alleles that were reduced after zinc supplementation.",

            "text": "The effect of zinc supplementation may be related to the levels of other cations such as cadmium, lead, calcium, iron, manganese, and copper. The beneficial effects of zinc on ameliorating toxicity of cadmium and lead, the accentuation of zinc deficiency by administration of calcium and phytate, and production of hypocupremia by excessive zinc intake in humans and animals are some examples of competition phenomena between these cations (Hill 1976). Such a competition occurs because these ions have similar valence shell electronic structure and therefore could be antagonist to each other. For instance, the competition between zinc and iron (Fe++) occurs at the level of cysteine-histidine ligands for the formation of iron or zinc \u201cfingers\u201d proteins (Prasad 1993). If iron is in excess, a preferential binding of iron than zinc to the metal free-protein occurs. Excess of zinc or zinc deficiency impairs DNA-protein interactions of zinc fingers domains with their cognate DNA target sites. In these conditions the production of some transcriptional factors like SP1 or TFIIIA is altered (Thiesen and Bach 1991). Similar transcriptional alterations occur in excess or deficiency of copper (Prasad 1993). This reinforces the notion of the relevance of interactions between zinc and copper as well as with other metals in the immune efficiency (Sandstead 1995). In order to avoid interference with copper homeostasis, it has been proposed to not exceed 2\u20133 times the RDA with zinc supplementation and to perform alternate cycles of supplementation not longer than 1\u20132 months (Licastro et al. 1994; Feillet-Coudray et al. 2006).",

            "text": " Glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), a family of the selenoproteins, protect cells against oxidative damage by catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and other hydroperoxides (Hall et al. 1998; Brigelius-Floh\u00e9 1999). Five selenium-dependent GPx isoforms exist in humans and four isoforms in mice. GPx1 is found in the cytosol of almost all cells and catalyzes the reduction of free hydroperoxides. GPx2 is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and has a substrate specificity similar to GPx1; GPx3 is an extracellular enzyme found in plasma and reduces membrane-bound phospholipid hydroperoxides (Brigelius-Floh\u00e9 1999). GPx4 is expressed in various tissues, and reduces phospholipid hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide using also thiols, such as 2-mercaptoethanol, cysteine, and homocysteine, other than GSH as reductant agents (Roveri et al. 1994). The isoform GPx6 seems to be specifically expressed in embryonic tissues and olfactory epithelium (Kryukov et al. 2003). It also exists as a selenium-independent isoform, GPx5, which is an epididymis isoenzyme present in mice and humans (Hall et al. 1998), but its mRNA was found to be not translated into functional protein in human epididymis (Ghyselinck et al. 1993). Selenium is also involved in the thioredoxin system, a major enzymatic system that plays an important role in maintaining the redox state of the cell (Holmgren 1985). This system is highly complementary to the GSH system in protecting against oxidative stress (Watson et al. 2004). It comprises basically of thioredoxin (Trx) and the selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TR) and uses the reducing power of NADPH to act as a potent antioxidant system as well as a general disulfide redox system (Rundlof and Arner 2004). Mammalian TR maintains Trx in a reduced state (Holmgren 1985) and reduces a variety of other substrates including nondisulfides. The thioredoxin system protects the cell against oxidative stress through a variety of mechanisms. Trx can directly quench single oxygen and scavenge hydroxyl radicals (Das and Das 2000), or reduced Trx can indirectly serve as an electron donor for Trx peroxidase. In addition, human TR is directly capable to efficiently reduce lipid hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and organic hydroperoxides using NADPH, especially in the presence of catalytic amount of selenocysteine, thus serving as an important alternative to the Gpx pathway for the elimination of harmful hydroperoxides (Bj\u00f6rnstedt et al. 1995). Trx system is also critical for signal transduction (Arner and Holmgren 2000) and in the restoration of the reduced form of several antioxidant compounds, including ascorbic acid, lipoic acid, and ubiquinone (Nordberg and Arner 2001). In this context, selenomethionine, a potent catalytic antioxidant in biological system and an aminoacid occurring in proteins in place of methionine (Walter and Roy 1971), reacts more efficiently than methionine (Padmaja et al. 1996) with oxidants forming methionine selenoxide which, in turn, is effectively and rapidly reduced to seleniomethionine by glutathione (Assmann et al. 1998). In contrast, methionine sulfoxide, which is produced by the oxidation of methionine in presence of oxidants, is not simply reduced by GSH, but it requires a specific enzymatic reaction catalyzed by methionine sulfoxide reductase (Levine et al. 1996). Since selenomethionine can occur in proteins such as hemoglobin (Beilstein and Whanger 1986), these residues may play a defensive role against peroxinitite.",

A recent paper investigated the ability of selenium supplementation in vitro (in the form of Na2SeO3 100 nM or 200 nM) to modify monocyte cell viability and ROS production under condition of oxidative stress (induced by Paraquat 100 mM and S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine 10 mM) (Leighton et al. 2015). The experiments indicated that selenium supplementation, especially with the lower dose tested, was effective in improving cell viability and ROS quenching ability of monocytes. A previous study addressing the influence of selenium supplementation \u201cin vitro\u201d on macrophages reported enhanced phagocytosis, degranulation, and production of superoxide anion after phorbol myristate (Safir et al. 2003).",

Indeed, ROS are not only used to kill pathogens, but they have been recently recognized as important mediators of cell signaling and cell to cell communication in phagocytic and nonphagocytic immune cells (Zhang et al. 2016). So, even if we know that Se compounds in vitro may affect ROS production and phagocyte function (Huang et al. 2012), the overall rationale for supplementation strategies can only derive from \u201cin vivo\u201d supplementation studies. Furthermore, there is evidence that as in the case of zinc the expression of several selenoproteins involved in antioxidant defense is specifically affected in response to cellular senescence (Yona et al. 2014; Malavolta et al. 2014; Provinciali et al. 2016). Taking into account that senescent cells accumulate with aging and that cellular senescence is a phenomenon that displays antagonistic pleiotropic effects (Campisi 2014) on physiological and pathological processes, it is likely that many changes observed with aging and attributed to changes in selenium status involve the process of cellular senescence and that their impact on overall health are rather difficult to be correctly predicted.

            "text": "Multiple experimental studies in animal models have revealed that Se-deficiency impairs immune response to infection, cancer, and other stimuli. For example, Se deficiency was reported to reduce CD4+ T cell response in mice challenged with a peptide/adjuvant (Hoffmann et al. 2010), to increase tumor growth and burden in a breast cancer mouse model (Chen et al. 2013), to increase type I allergic response in a mouse model of cutaneous anaphylaxis (Arakawa et al. 2013), and to increase immunotoxicity of arsenic (Rodr\u00edguez-Sosa et al. 2013). The IL-6 and interferon-\u03b3 pathways appear to be among the pathway more responsive to dietary selenium intake in mice (Tsuji et al. 2015). Although excessive releases of IL-6 and interferon-\u03b3 have been associated with inflamaging, moderate increases and adequate response of these cytokines are known play a pivotal role in host defense through the ability to activate macrophage cell functions thus contributing to keep under control infectious diseases. Decreased dietary selenium can change a normally avirulent B3 coxsackievirus (CBV3/0) into a virulent virus ( CBV3/20) by inducing changes in viral genoma, especially in viral RNA polymerase (Duarte et al. 1994). The mutated virus can infect heart muscle and cause myocarditis with the likely development of dilated cardiomyopathy and death (Beck and Levander 2000; Jun et al. 2011). Similar to the data reported for Coxsackie virus, selenium intake and selenium status affected the host immune response, the mutation rate of the viral genome, and the pathology in mice infected with the human influenza A/Bangkok/1/79 (H3N2) virus (Nelson et al. 2001). However, the impact of selenium status on the outcome of the immune response appears to depend on the virulence of the applied influenza A virus strain. Indeed, opposite results with an increased mortality of the selenium adequate group were observed using a the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus, which is highly pathogenic in mice (Li and Beck 2007).",

In general, Se deficiency appears to affect DMH toxicity with, however, no inhibition of tumor development by nutritional Se (0.1 ppm Se) (Pence and Buddingh 1985). Three relevant papers report a greater development of carcinoma by DHM or DMBA in various organs (colon and mammary gland) of rats under selenium deficiency in comparison with rats treated with 5 ppm of Se (Jacobs 1983; Liu and Milner 1992; McGarrity and Peiffer 1993).

A Finnish study adding selenium to fertilizer has shown only an increased selenium status in the general population (young, adult, old) (Aro et al. 1995) without any clear beneficial effect on general health. A recent randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken to test the effects of Se supplementation on a variety of parameters of anti-flu immunity in healthy subjects aged 50\u201364 years (Ivory et al. 2015). The authors used six doses of Se (in different form from 0 to 200 \u03bcg/day) for 12 weeks in six groups of individuals with plasma Se levels <110 ng/mL who received Flu vaccine (at week 10). In this trial, Se supplementation resulted in both beneficial and detrimental effects on cellular immunity to flu that was affected by the form of Se, supplemental dose and delivery matrix.

Supplemented patients displayed a significant decrease in insulin, homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance, homeostatic model assessment-beta cell function, serum hs-CRP, and a significant increase in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index score and plasma total antioxidant capacity concentrations. The positive impact on these biomarkers is, unfortunately, not complemented by a long-term follow-up. However, reduced cardiovascular mortality at 10-years follow-up was observed in another supplementation trial performed on 443 elderly with selenium and coenzyme Q10 (Alehagen et al. 2015). In agreement with the protective role of selenium a Sweden study performed in 668 elderly subjects showed that persons with serum Se in the lowest quartile had 43% and 56% increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively (Alehagen et al. 2016). This confirms the reduced incidence of cardiovascular diseases observed in previous studies after supplementation with selenium combined in multivitamins supplements (Czernichow et al. 2005; Shenoy et al. 2006). There is also evidence that a number of HIV-positive patients suffer from deficiencies in vitamins including selenium (Coodley 1995). Enhanced GPx and GSH activity (Delmas-Beauvieux et al. 1996) were observed in HIV patients receiving oral selenium supplementation. This finding suggests that GPx and GSH activity may represent natural inhibitors of ( AIDS) viruses and that selenium supplementation may play a role in prevention antiviral strategies (Rayman 2000). Of interest, supplementation with multivitamins and trace elements, including Se, during treatment of pulmonary Tuberculosis reduced mortality in subjects co-infected with HIV (Range et al. 2006).",

Another large supplementation trial with lower amount of selenium (50 \u03bcg) performed in Lixian (North China) showed a small but significant reduction in total and cancer mortality was observed in subjects receiving selenium supplement (Blot et al. 1995). The impact of Se supplementation was better in women than men and, interestingly, the effects were more pronounced in persons under the age of 55 years compared to individuals older than 55 years. Moreover, supplementation with 200 mg/day of sodium selenite during therapy of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck resulted in a significantly enhanced cell-mediated immune responsiveness (better response of lymphocytes to stimulation with mitogen, generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, and destruction of tumor cells) (Kiremidjian-Schumacher et al. 2000). Considering these results, it might be assumed that younger persons might be more amenable to a protective effect of selenium supplementation. However, a recent large Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) carried out in North America has reported unexpected and very concerning findings, especially the increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer among men with high selenium status (Kristal et al. 2014). Perhaps, the most conclusive data regarding the story of selenium and cancer can be retrieved from an excellent systematic review that included 55 prospective observational studies as well as 8 randomized clinical trials (Vinceti et al. 2014). The authors of this systematic review concluded that the inverse association between selenium exposure and the risk of some types of cancer cannot be taken as evidence of a causal relation, and that all these studies have many limitations, including issues with the form and the assessment of selenium, heterogeneity, confounding and other biases. Moreover, randomized clinical trials reported inverse, null, and direct associations have been reported for some cancer types which overall yielded inconsistent results with even harmful effects of selenium exposure. Hence, to date, no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in humans. ",

            "text": "Dietary zinc and selenium are important nutritional factors for the immune response in protecting against the appearance of age-related diseases. There is a number of biochemical processes in which selenium and zinc interact. Selenium compounds that have the capacity to form selenol(ate)s catalytically couple with the glutathione/glutathione disulfide and metallothionein/thionein redox pairs to either release or bind zinc. (Maret 2003). When MT are oxidized by glutathion disulfide (GSSG) or other disulfides free zinc is released in the cytosol. However, the efficiency of this chemical reaction seems very low even at high concentrations of GSSG in the absence of selenium. In contrast, the release of zinc from MT may occur very rapidly in presence of selenium compounds have the capacity to form selenol(ate)s (Maret 2003). The mechanism of the reaction was suggested to proceed through an activated selenenyl sulfide R-Se-S-G intermediate which, in turn, oxidizes the zinc-thiolate cluster of MT to form R-Se-S-MT with the concomitant release of zinc during the oxidation (Chen and Maret 2001). The selenol group is subsequently released by the attack of a nearby thiol group of MT that convert R-Se-S-MT into thionein generating a catalytic cycle of oxidative zinc release from MT. Other oxidized selenium compounds, such as selenoxide and selenic acid, may be directly reduced by MT through the formation of a R-Se-S-MT intermediate and the concomitant release of zinc, followed by the formation of an inter- or intramolecular disulfide bond (Jacob et al. 1999; Chen and Maret 2001; Klotz et al. 2003).",

(1999) determined the effects of a long-term (for 2 years) daily supplementation with zinc (20 mg) plus selenium (100 \u03bcg) on immunity and the incidence of infections in a large number (n.725) of institutionalized elderly people (>65 years). The main results of the study were: (1) selenium-deficient patients decreased from about 80% to 5\u201310% in the selenium supplemented group after 6 months of supplementation with respect to placebo group; (2) antibody titres after influenza vaccine were higher in groups that receive trace elements; and (3) trace element-supplemented patients were those who remained most free of respiratory tract infections than placebo group. These findings suggest that low dose supplementation of zinc and selenium provides significant improvement in elderly patients by increasing the humoral response after vaccination and decreased influenza compliances (respiratory tract infections) with thus a possible impact on the maintenance of health conditions during aging. However, conversely to the conventional belief and claims that supplementation with Zn and Se may improve health conditions there are important studies that observed lack of clear effects. The large SU.VI.MAX trial conducted with a supplement of antioxidant including zinc and selenium reported no effects on health-related quality of life after 76 months of supplementation in 8112 French adults (Brian\u00e7on et al. 2011). In addition, supplementation with low or medium doses of zinc and selenium provided no benefits, neither were able to correct low zinc or selenium status in hemodialysis patients (Tonelli et al. 2015). In conclusion, conversely to the past belief that zinc and selenium supplements could be used as elixir of long life, recent epidemiologic and laboratory studies are changing our perception of the biological effects of these essential trace elements.

            "text": "While several studies suggest that correcting zinc and selenium deficiency in aging provide a beneficial impact on immunosenescence, it is evident that controversial finding exists on the \u201creal\u201d necessity of micronutrient supplementation (Dangour et al. 2004). The critical step of supplementation strategies with zinc and selenium still remains the diagnosis of zinc and selenium deficiency, as there are no validated methods to assess their status in aging. However, in the case of documented deficiency, it seems to make sense to provide selenium supplements associated with zinc and even with additional supplements. Indeed, micronutrient deficiencies are usually not isolated and some biochemical mechanisms involved in the action of selenium are under the control of zinc ion bioavailability. In other words, the attempt to correct selenium deficiency alone may result in lack of beneficial effects due to the presence of zinc or other micro- and macronutrient deficiency. Many points still require further investigations, first of all, the possible involvement of MT, zinc, and selenium in antagonistic pleiotropic mechanisms that regulate mammalian life span. One of these mechanisms is cellular senescence, which has gained considerable attention in these last years as a useful anti-aging target. Useful tools are available, such as NO donors and zinc fluorescent probes (zinpyr-1 and fluozin-3) to help researcher in the quantitative assessment of labile zinc and on the functional role of MT (Malavolta et al. 2006; Haase et al. 2006) in senescent cells. These tools applied in supplementation trials performed in animal models that allow to visualize, sort, and selectively eliminate senescent cells (Demaria et al. 2014) could help to clarify these mechanisms. Additional insight could be provided by the investigation of serum trace elements associated with MT induction in PBMC obtained from centenarian\u2019s offspring in the framework of Markage project (B\u00fcrkle et al. 2015). The results may help to understand the physiological mechanisms involved in healthy aging and may help to understand new strategies for nutritional or pharmacological intervention aimed at increased longevity in healthy conditions.",
