Central to the drug discovery process is gene identification followed by determination of the expression of genes in a given disease and understanding of the function of the gene products. It is of interest that the identification, in the early 1980s, of the gene believed to be responsible for cystic fibrosis took researchers approx 9 yr to discover, whereas the gene responsible for Parkinson\u2019s disease was identified within a period of several weeks (3). This quantum leap in the ability to associate a specific gene with a disease can be attributed primarily to the extraordinary progress that has been made in the areas of gene sequencing and information technologies.",

The development of high-throughput methods in both biology and chemistry is therefore necessary. In addition, it has become increasingly challenging to translate successfully basic scientific discoveries into clinical experimental medicine and novel therapeutics. Consequently, a new paradigm for drug discovery has emerged. The integration of clinical, genetic, genomic, and molecular phenotype data partnered with cheminformatics is involved in this process. Central to this process, the data that are generated are managed, collated, and interpreted with the use of informatics. In this review, we address the use of new technologies that have arisen to deal with this new paradigm.",

In diseased tissue, gene expression levels often differ from those observed in normal tissues, with certain genes being over- or underexpressed, or new genes being expressed or completely absent. Localization of this differential gene expression is one of the first crucial steps in identifying an important potential molecular target for drug discovery. In addition to the traditional techniques of Northern analysis, a number of newer methods are used to localize gene expression. The techniques that typically yield the highest quality data are in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunocytochemistry, both of which are labor intensive. For example, ISH or immunohistochemical localization of a prospective molecular target to a particular tissue or subcellular region is likely to yield valuable information concerning gene function. Examples of the success of this approach include the case of the orexin peptides and receptors whose hypothalamic regional localization suggested an involvement in feeding (6).",

ISH can be initiated immediately following gene sequencing and cloning; however, gene detection is only at the transcriptional mRNA level. Immunocytochemistry, on the other hand, offers the ability to measure protein expression but requires the availability of antibodies having the requisite affinity and selectivity, which may often take several months to generate. With either of these techniques, target localization within the cell is possible at the microscopic level but is dependent on the availability of high-quality normal and diseased human tissues, which may often represent a limiting factor.",

Microarray gridding and Spotfire\u00ae data analysis are already evolving into procedures that allow the comprehensive evaluation of differences in gene expression patterns in normal, diseased, or pharmacologically manipulated systems (8, 9). For genes expressed in low abundance, more sensitive techniques may be required, and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-based TaqMan technology offers the ability to detect changes in gene expression with as little as two copies per cell.

Just as DNA microarrays allow the detection of changes in genes in various diseases, protein, peptide, tissue, and cell microarrays can be used to detect changes in proteins, phospholipids, or glycation of proteins in disease. Protein arrays are also used to examine enzyme-substrate, DNA-protein, and protein-protein interactions (16,17). The practical application of proteomics depends on the ability to identify and analyze each protein product in a cell or tissue (18). Because proteins cannot be amplified like DNA or RNA and proteins also tend to be degraded more readily, sensitive and rapid analyses are necessary to account for the small sample sizes and instability of proteins. Although this field is still developing, a MS and ProteinChip-surfaceenhanced laser desorption/ionization technologies using slides with various surface properties (e.g., ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, metal chelation) to bind and selectively purify proteins from a complex biological sample are being utilized (18,19). An important challenge encountered with protein microarrays is maintaining functionality of the protein, such as posttranslational modifications and phosphorylation. Another important consideration is the retention of both secondary and tertiary structures. The use of immobilizing coatings, such as aluminum, gold, or hydrophilic polymers, on slides or imprinting the proteins on porous polyacrylamide gels is being explored to address these issues (17). For example, proteomic analysis has been used successfully to identify serum biomarkers. ProteinChip-surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization technology, in conjunction with bioinformatics tools, has been utilized to identify a proteomic pattern in serum that is diagnostic for ovarian cancer (20). It is anticipated that proteomics and bioinformatics will facilitate the discovery of new and better biomarkers of disease.",

Although metabolomics generally focuses on biofluids, such as serum and urine, investigators are now evaluating the cell as well. Metabolic profiling has been used regularly to characterize toxicity and disease states, such as inborn errors of metabolism. Additionally, blood and urine are screened routinely for metabolites such as cholesterol and glucose in patients to test for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, a recent advance in metabolomics is the analysis of small molecules within a sample to find new markers for disease or metabolic patterns as indicators for drug toxicity. Techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, MS, and chromatographic analysis of cell extracts are used in metabolomic research (22,23). These techniques have been especially useful in generating lipid metabolome data (i.e., lipomics) to study the effects of dietary fats and lipid-lowering drugs on cardiac, plasma, adipose, and liver phospholipid metabolism (22\u201327). Metabolic changes during tumor proliferation have also been studied using metabolomics. For example, the tumor metabolome is characterized by high glycolytic and glutaminolytic capacities and high phosphometabolite levels to allow tumor cells to proliferate over broad ranges in oxygen and glucose supply (28). It is anticipated that metabolics will provide insight into the metabolism of tumor cells that might be helpful in understanding and modifying tumor cell proliferation.",

Combinatorial chemistry in some of its earliest incarnations was seen as a means of rapidly synthesizing massive numbers of molecules for HTS. However, in recent years this has evolved into the synthesis of more focused, smaller arrays of molecules directed both at enhancement of the properties of early hits emerging from HTS and at optimization of lead molecules in the progression toward development of candidates (32,33).

Pharmacogenomics refers to the identification of genes that are involved in determining drug responsiveness and that may cause differential drug responses in different patients. These studies include the evaluation of allelic differences in gene expression, and the evaluation of genes responsible for drug resistance and sensitivity (35,36). Toxicogenomics refers to the characterization of potential genes involved in toxicity and the adverse effects of drugs (35,37). Toxicogenomics allows for a gene profile of candidate biomarkers of toxicity and carcinogenicity. Predictive toxicology is a term used for the application of toxicogenomics and the evaluation of compounds in silico against a panel of genes associated with toxicity (38). Models of SAR are used to predict potential toxic effects based on chemical structures and their properties (39). Predictive toxicology also takes into account computer-based predictions of adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and PK properties in addition to toxicology, all of which contribute to the lead optimization process.",

In this model, suction is applied to the forearm of healthy volunteers following pre exposure to ultraviolet-B light. The resulting blister is used to evaluate secreted inflammatory mediators and changes in gene expression within 48 h of insult. Cell counts, prostaglandin (PG)E2 (measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), PGD2 (measured by gas chromatography), and gene expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2, and PGE and PGD synthases (measured by real-time PCR) are assessed. This model allows the rapid analysis of effects of drugs on cellular infiltration, soluble mediator formation in blister fluid, and steady-state gene expression in cellular infiltrates. These markers (e.g., new transcription factors, cytokines, and other mediators) can be followed in both the inflammatory and resolution phases of human inflammation. In addition, coupled with DNA array technology, this model may be useful in defining new targets for the treatment of inflammation. Furthermore, toxicity and efficacy profiles of new and existing drugs can be studied. For example, a gene chip of the subset of human genes identified in blister fluid can be used to identify surrogate markers of toxicity and efficacy in modulating gene expression in drug evaluation.",
