Resolution of inflammation is an active process, and the pro-resolution effects of lipoxins, resolvins and protectins have received significant interest. Here, we review emerging data on the role of these lipid mediators in infectious disease. Lipoxins influence host control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium berghei cerebral malaria in mice. Their effects are protective in toxoplasmosis, T. cruzi infection and cerebral malaria but detrimental in tuberculosis; related to the balance between pathogen-control and excessive immune response. Topical lipoxin abrogates the tissue damage seen in a rabbit model of Porphyromonas gingivalis periodontitis. The increased virulence of H5N1 influenza A virus in mice correlates with reduced expression of SOCS2, required to mediate the effects of lipoxin. Mice unable to synthesize lipoxin suffer increased lung pathology during respiratory syncytial virus infection. Protectin suppresses influenza A virus replication in vitro and increases survival in a mouse model of severe influenza infection. Resolvins were investigated in a number of animal models of systemic bacterial infection, and were found to enhance phagocytic clearance of bacteria, reduce inflammation severity, promote neutrophil apoptosis, modulate neutrophil chemotaxis and importantly, reduce mortality. Interestingly, resolvin also enhances the antibacterial effect of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Topical resolvin application reduces the severity of herpes simplex virus ocular infection in mice. If the effects of these mediators translate from pre-clinical studies into successful clinical trials, they represent promising new strategies in managing infectious disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Inflammation is an essential host defence mechanism, required for protection against pathogenic micro-organisms and viruses. However, an excessive and non-resolving inflammatory response is damaging to the host. For example, in sepsis there is loss of homeostatic control over the inflammatory response mounted against an infectious agent, resulting in a pro-inflammatory, procoagulant state that can result in organ dysfunction and death. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is another example, and describes the life-threatening hypoxic complication of excessive pulmonary inflammation that can be triggered by a range of insults, including pneumonia and sepsis. 1 Chronic, non-resolving inflammation also underpins a number of other pulmonary diseases, including asthma, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Inflamma critical events following the clearance of an infectious agent, to prevent the development of these 'complications' of excessive inflammation. This is now known to be an active process, termed catabasis, 2 driven by the pro-resolution lipid mediators resolvin, protectin and lipoxin. 3 Lipoxins (trihydroxy-tetraene-containing eicosanoids) are derived from the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid through sequential reactions involving lipoxygenase enzymes (including 15-lipoxygenase type 1 and 5-lipoxygenase in human mucosal tissues). 4, 5 Resolvins are derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and exist as two series (D and E). D-series resolvins are products of docosahexaenoic acid metabolism involving 15-lipoxygenase. E-series resolvins are synthesized from eicosapentaenoic acid involving aspirin-acetylated cyclo-oxygenase 2. 6 Protectins are also omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid derivatives, generated from docosahexaenoic acid through a 15-lipoxygenase-mediated pathway. 7 The pro-resolution effects of these mediators are exemplified by their role in pulmonary inflammation, the setting in which they are best studied. Resolvins, protectins and lipoxins all have a proresolution role in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. [8] [9] [10] [11] Given that an excessive inflammatory response is implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of infectious diseases and their complications, including sepsis syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome, we conducted a review of the literature to determine what is currently known about the role of the pro-resolution lipid mediators lipoxin, resolvin and protectin in infectious disease. 13 In mice, H5N1 was more virulent (infection resulted in shorter survival time) than the H1N1 strain and disseminated to extra-pulmonary sites (brain and spleen) following intra-nasal inoculation. Global transcriptional responses to infection were analysed and showed that the different strains of influenza A virus caused different early responses in gene expression, and that many of the differentially regulated genes were components of the inflammatory response. H5N1 infection was associated with up-regulation of inflammasome genes [including caspase 1 and interleukin-1 (IL-1)], tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interferon-c (IFN-c) and protein kinase R, as well as other inflammation-related genes. Using a bioinformatics approach to analyse gene expression, the authors found that extra-pulmonary dissemination was associated with down-regulation of genes involved in mediating the pro-resolution effects of lipoxin on leucocyte recruitment and counter-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine induction. These included the suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 2 gene, the product of which is activated by lipoxins and is an essential intracellular mediator of lipoxin's effects on inflammatory cell trafficking and cytokine induction. 14 Therefore, loss of lipoxin's pro-resolution effects may be associated with greater influenza A virus virulence, suggesting a protective role for lipoxin in this infection, possibly related to the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are up-regulated in this model. The highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus used in this study was less successful at spreading between human hosts compared with other influenza A virus strains, for example the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain. A successful pathogen minimizes damage to its host to prolong the availability of its replicative niche and the high case-mortality seen with infection by this H5N1 strain indicates that it is not well adapted to humans.

Interestingly, resolvin administration also enhanced the antibacterial effect of ciprofloxacin (in E. coli peritonitis) and vancomycin (in Staphylococcus aureus skin infection) when the antimicrobial was administered at a sub-optimal concentration. Topical resolvin application also reduced the severity of herpes simplex virus ocular infection in mice. Finally, protectin was found to increase survival in a mouse model of severe influenza, even when administered 2 days after infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Given the well-recognized importance of these mediators in allergic airway inflammation, it is interesting to consider how their regulation may be disturbed in states of airway inflammation induced by infection, for examples acute respiratory distress syndrome. Notably, pulmonary production of protectin was found to be suppressed by highly pathogenic influenza A strains. 37 Evidence from Cilloniz et al. 12 suggests that lipoxin-mediated activity is also altered during influenza A virus infection. Disturbed lipoxin regulation could have a role in the predisposition towards asthma seen in infants following RSV bronchiolitis, 39, 40 especially when considering the finding that mice unable to synthesize lipoxin fail to elicit alternative macrophage differentiation, required for the resolution of RSV disease. 15, 16 If the beneficial effects of these mediators translate from pre-clinical studies into clinical trials, they represent promising new strategies in the management of infectious disease. The pro-resolution, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial-enhancing effects of resolvins, protectin and possibly lipoxins make these appealing candidates for further study in humans. From a therapeutic perspective it is important to note that these pro-resolution mediators enjoy a substantial advantage over steroids for use in the treatment of infectious inflammation, or other systemic inflammatory states, as they are not immunosuppressive agents. 'Aspirin-triggered' lipoxins and resolvins share the pro-resolution effects of lipoxin A4 and resolvin D1, respectively, and act by the same intracellular pathways. 11, 14, 41 This effect is unique to aspirin, and is not shared with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which do not trigger the biosynthesis of these mediators. Due to its ability to trigger the production of these pro-resolution mediators there may be a new role for aspirin in managing the inflammatory sequelae of infectious disease.", "cite_spans":
