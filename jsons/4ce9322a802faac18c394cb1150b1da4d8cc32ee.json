The healthcare impact of the epidemic in India was studied using a stochastic mathematical model. Methods: A compartmental SEIR model was developed, in which the flow of individuals through compartments is modeled using a set of differential equations. Different scenarios were modeled with 1000 runs of Monte Carlo simulation each using MATLAB. Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) requirements, and deaths were modeled on SimVoi software. The impact of nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) including social distancing and lockdown on checking the epidemic was estimated. Results: Uninterrupted epidemic in India would have resulted in more than 364 million cases and 1.56 million deaths with peak by mid-July. As per the model, at current growth rate of 1.15, India is likely to reach approximately 3 million cases by 25 May, implying 125,455 (\u00b118,034) hospitalizations, 26,130 (\u00b13298) ICU admissions, and 13,447 (\u00b11819) deaths. This would overwhelm India's healthcare system. The model shows that with immediate institution of NPIs, the epidemic might still be checked by mid-April 2020. It would then result in 241,974 (\u00b133,735) total infections, 10,214 (\u00b11649) hospitalizations, 2121 (\u00b1334) ICU admissions, and 1081 (\u00b1169) deaths.",

By 30 Mar, India had reported 1251 cases and 32 deaths. 3 The spread of any epidemic depends on the infectivity of the pathogen and the available susceptible population. For a novel infection, when disease dynamics are still unclear, mathematical modeling estimates the number of cases in worst-and best-case scenarios. It can also help estimate the effect of preventive measures adopted against COVID-19. With suppressive strategies, the aim is to maintain the effective reproduction number (R) below 1, to prevent further spread of infection, while in a mitigation strategy, the aim is to blunt the effect of the epidemic. 4 Nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) utilized to contain epidemics (social distancing; closure of schools, universities, and offices; avoidance of mass gatherings, community-wide containment, etc.) may be applied to the general population, contacts of cases (contact-tracing, surveillance, quarantine), and the cases themselves (early reporting, isolation). 4, 5 India appears to be in early stages of the epidemic. It is important to predict how the disease is likely to evolve among the population. This will help in estimation of healthcare requirements and permit a measured allocation of resources. Considering the differences in the way COVID-19 has spread in different countries, any planning for mounting a fresh response has to be adaptable and situation-specific. When the actual numbers are relatively few, a mathematical simulation approach is best suited toward understanding this epidemic and formulating an appropriate response.",

The flow of individuals through these compartments was modeled using a set of differential equations (Table 1) . The model assumes a completely susceptible population (S) with homogeneous mixing. The disease has an incubation period after which an exposed individual becomes infectious. Susceptible individuals become infected at a rate, b, by infectious individuals. The number of exposed individuals is captured by the term bIS. These individuals are removed from the (S) compartment and added to the Exposed (E) compartment. Once infected, the individual remains exposed for the incubation period before becoming infectious. Exposed individuals are thus removed from the E compartment at a removal rate of \u03b5, which is 1/incubation period, and are added to the Infectious (I) compartment. To model the effects of isolation, wherein infectious individuals are isolated so that they are unable to infect the susceptible population, we added a Quarantine (Q) compartment. A fraction (q) of individuals from the (I) compartment move to the Q compartment, once they are isolated/quarantined. Those remaining in the I compartment recover at a rate g, equal to 1/infectious period, or die at a rate d, equal to the disease-related death rate. Individuals from the Q compartment recover after the period of quarantine and are removed at a rate, qt, equal to 1/period of quarantine, or die at the disease-related death rate, d. The Q compartment captured the hospital or home quarantine of infective individuals. The dynamics of transition to and from this compartment was thus captured using the proportion of infected persons quarantined and the period of quarantine. 7 A stochastic model using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was created using MATLAB/SIMULINK Release 2018b (The Math-Works, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States).",

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) estimates that India has about 70,000 ICU beds and even fewer ventilators. 12 We estimate that if around one-third or 25,000 of the available ICU beds were allocated for COVID-19 cases alone, it would result in negative ripple effects among those with other serious diseases requiring ICU care. The current growth rate of the epidemic in India was calculated to be 1. 15 Mortality rates of COVID-19 disease in those older than 60 years are significantly higher (50e1000 times) than in younger age groups 8 (Fig. 5 ). While the elderly (>60 years) comprise around 10% of the population in India, in our model, they accounted for approximately 43% of all hospital admissions and about 82% each of ICU admissions and deaths. The elderly are most likely to get infected by their household contacts. Hence, special and novel NPIs may have to be developed for them, with a greater focus among their household contacts.",

It could be lower if the country collectively achieves quarantine levels above 50%. The numbers infected finally become manageable, reducing from millions to merely thousands. From being completely overwhelmed, India can now look at setting certain planning targets, where the available healthcare resources are not completely saturated. Each passing day makes the task of controlling the epidemic more out of reach. In the mathematical model of the epidemic, the infectious group is neatly compartmentalized. In real life, at least 50% of them need to be quarantined/isolated for the graph to reach inflection point. Considering the current rising trend, it appears that more than 50% of the infected persons in the population have not been identified at present. The reasons appear to be twofold. Unlike in the model, the infectious group is not clearly identifiable in the community, as many of them are presymptomatic/asymptomatic or with mild symptoms who do not seek medical care. There are also people with known exposure (e.g., return from foreign travel) who might not effectively submit to self-quarantine. Once community spread commences, it becomes difficult to even identify exposure. It has been estimated from early studies that 40e50% of infectious individuals remain asymptomatic and they are equally infectious as those who are symptomatic. 13e15 Early testing of greater numbers is likely to identify more infective individuals. The ICMR cautiously has recommended an increase in the numbers to be tested. 16 The only way to prevent transmission from undetected infective cases to susceptible population is to implement universal NPI measures.",

Among the infectious, besides isolation, contact-tracing is a key element in fighting the epidemic. It helps focus attention on tracing and quarantining, as quickly as possible, those whom the infected case might have transmitted the infection to.

A recent mathematical model published by the ICMR predicted a 62% reduction in cumulative incidence in the optimistic scenario. 17 COVID-19 is here to stay. In the long term, the only protections against COVID-19 are development of herd immunity or the availability of an effective vaccine. The latter is possibly 12e18 months away. Herd immunity may be achieved when 55e65% of population is infected. 18 This will occur over many months. However, because the epidemic will definitely be partially controlled with implemented measures, it is likely to follow a yoeyo pattern and the herd immunity might take longer to achieve. Hence, until herd immunity is achieved, containment measures, possibly intermittently administered over a prolonged period of time, will required to be in place.",
