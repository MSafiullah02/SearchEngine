            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the etiologic agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a highly contagious disease with a high mortality rate in neonatal pigs. PED was first reported among feeder and fattening pigs in England and Belgium during the 1970s (Wood, 1977). The disease was first recorded in China during the 1980s, and a more virulent form of the virus appeared in 2010 (Wang et al., 2013). PEDV is an alphacoronavirus assigned to the family Coronaviridae with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb. The genome consists of seven open reading frames (ORFs) encoding four structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], nucleocapsid [N]), two non-structural proteins (pp1a and pp1ab), and an accessory gene (ORF3) located between the S and E genes. The M protein, a component of the outer envelope of the viral particle, is categorized as a type III glycoprotein consisting of a short amino-terminal ectodomain, three successive transmembrane domains, and a long carboxy-terminal inner envelope domain (De Haan et al., 2000). The protein participates in viral assembly through interaction with the S and N proteins, viral budding (De Haan et al., 2000; Klumperman et al., 1994; Arndt et al., 2010), and may also mitigate the host innate immune responses. For instance, M protein is reported to induced cell cycle arrest at the S-phase via the cyclin A pathway (Xu et al., 2015) and may modulate the host innate immune responses by inhibiting the IFN-\u03b2 and IRF3 promoter activities (Zhang et al., 2016; Song and Park, 2012). As obligate parasites, viruses rely on host: pathogen protein-protein interactions to modulate the ongoing biochemical activities of the host cells so that they benefit virus proliferation (Crua et al., 2017). However, the interactome profile of PEDV M protein in host cells is still unclear although, in order to fulfill the aforementioned functions of M proteins, their interaction with a large number of host cell proteins would be expected to occur. In this study, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to generate an interactome profile of PEDV M protein and to identify the viral and host cell protein interactions.",

PEDV mainly infects pig small intestinal epithelial cells. However, attempts at PEDV proliferation in a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line were unsuccessful. Consequently, we selected Vero cells, previously shown to be highly susceptible and permissive to PEDV infection (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988), to investigate the M protein interactome. Co-IP and LC-MS/MS identified three viral proteins (Spike-S, Envelope-E and ORF3) and 218 host cell proteins that appeared to interact with M protein in PEDV DR13att-infected Vero cells. Coronavirus (CoV) studies have shown that the M protein interacts with E protein and S proteins during the assembly of the CoV envelope (Nguyen and Hogue. 1997; Opstelten et al., 1995). In the present study, both the PEDV S and E proteins were immunoprecipitated together with the M protein, indicating an interaction with the latter. Our data also showed that anti-M mAb immunoprecipitated truncated ORF3 protein in PEDV DR13att-infected cells, which suggested an interaction between the ORF3 and M proteins. Accessory proteins from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63 have also been shown to interact with M, S and E proteins (Tan et al., 2004; Muller et al., 2010). hCoV-NL63 ORF3 is a structural viral protein incorporated into viral particles (Muller et al., 2010) while PEDV ORF3 is involved in many host cell processes and in viral replication (Si et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2015; Kaewborisuth et al., 2018; Wongthida et al., 2017). The likelihood of interaction between PEDV M and ORF3 proteins suggests that the latter cooperates with M to take part in the process of PEDV assembly and budding.",

Rab proteins are a subfamily of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that are known to regulate specific intracellular membrane trafficking pathways (Spearman 2018). Among the six subfamily members, Rab11A has been studied most extensively in terms of its role in viral budding and release. Rab11 is reported to be essential for viral budding and release in RSV and HIV-1 (Brock et al., 2003; Varthakavi et al., 2006). Rab11A also played a role in influenza virus morphogenesis and budding, and depletion of Rab11 decreased viral titers by up to 100-fold (Bruce et al., 2010). Furthermore, Rab11A promoted porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication in a manner that correlated with autophagy (Wang et al., 2017). Rab11A may serve a similar function in the proliferation of PEDV, PRRSV and influenza viruses. However, our siRNA studies failed to reveal any correlation between Rab11A expression levels and PEDV production although the knockdown of the Rab11A gene may not have been sufficiently strong enough to interfere with the Rab11A protein-M protein interaction. Alternatively, other routes may exist that replace the function of Rab11A, and future studies will further investigate the role of Rab11A in PEDV infection.",

Studies have shown that many RNA viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (San-Juan-Vergara et al., 2012), rotavirus (RV) (Diaz-Salinas et al., 2014) and Ebola virus (EBOV) (Quinn et al., 2009) depend on CDC42 signaling pathway to infect target cells. However, in this study, interference with CDC42 expression did not influence the proliferation of PEDV, and the significance of the interaction between M protein and CDC42 needs to be further explored.",

These proteins were enriched in a variety of signaling pathways, including immune response, cell cycle and apoptosis, and are involved in a wide diversity of biological processes. Among the identified proteins, eIF3L influenced the proliferation of PEDV. Our findings should serve to elucidate novel functions of M and host cell proteins in PEDV-infected cells.",
