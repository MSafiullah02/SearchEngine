Hydrogen is stored and transported to destinations in gas, liquid or solid states, through natural gas pipelines, in pressurized tanks or cryogenic super-insulated vessels, or absorbed/bounded in metal/chemical hydrides, etc. [2, 4] . Practically, compressed hydrogen gas stored in containers and transported with trailers is widely used for vehicular utilization at present and liquefied hydrogen is a prospect economical way of large-scale storage and longjourney transport [5] . When hydrogen arrives at the refueling station, it is stored in the on-site cylinders in compressed gas or liquid state and filled to FCVs in the compressed gas state under different pressures [2] . The process from H 2 production to refueling is the hydrogen pathway for FCVs, which is illustrated in Fig. 1 .",

            "text": "Different H 2 economy is represented through various pathways. Apart from the technical routes, the location of projects, the distance between H 2 sources and refueling stations, the geographical features and delivery infrastructure all influence the pathway chosen. For example, Ref. [13] used field data from the FCB bus project with \"electrolysis \u00fe powerto-gas (PtG)\" H 2 pathway in Rhine-Main area in Germany, and simulated the H 2 economy under different bus substitution scenarios and H 2 pathways, concluding that a decentralized PtG plant and large scale H 2 supply chain would be suitable for the area under study. According to Ref. [12] , the levelized H 2 cost varies from USD 4.7/kg-H 2 (by distributed steam methane reforming) to USD 8.5/kg-H 2 (by central electrolysis with wind power and pipeline transport), with a prospect cost target of USD 2e4/kg-H 2 by distributed natural gas pathway in a mature market. However, the cost of H 2 on arrival at the refueling station does not equal the price of H 2 pumped into vehicles. Not like the industrial applications where hydrogen is usually used as direct feedstock, the FCVs need refueling stations that still have very high initial investment [14] . Generally, it takes around USD 2e3 million for one station and expected to drop to USD 1 million per station in the future [15] .",

FCVs are especially suitable for long-journey and heavy-duty transport [20] and will be comprehensively competitive as substitutes for the conventional and battery vehicles in the next two decades [21] . Despite the potentiality, the high cost during the life cycle vehicle ownership, the lack of refueling infrastructure, and less competitive H 2 end price, all hinder the adoption of FCVs [18, 22, 23] , which in turn discourages investors to build more refueling stations or offer competitive H 2 price due to non-profitability of H 2 refueling service [24] .

Despite the technical viability of the various H 2 pathways and FCV applications, still many economic uncertainties and risks hinder the investors and operators to act. From a life cycle perspective, water electrolysis by renewable electricity is the most suitable method to render zero-carbon hydrogen for vehicles in the long run [26] . But the cost of renewable H 2 from water is very sensitive to electrolysis efficiency and the electricity price [6] , and the latter one is influenced by the availability and reserves of water, wind, solar and other renewable resources and the investment of power plants and distribution grids [14, 25] . Tube trailer delivery is the cheapest option for short journey transport ( 50 km) due to its limited capacity, while liquid and pipeline delivery would be the options for large-volume and long-journey delivery. In addition to the H 2 states and amount delivered, the geographical context also affects the cost of delivery [15] . Though the costs of H 2 stations and FCVs are expected to decline with future deployment, the chicken-egg dilemma between H 2 infrastructure and vehicles will hardly be broken without a vision of profits.",

They have pointed out two methods to achieve low/no-carbon hydrogen in the long run: fossil-fuel hydrogen with CCS, and renewable hydrogen by water electrolysis. With the great uncertainty of CCS, to lower the cost of renewable hydrogen seems a practical method to try under current technology. This study aims to examine the hydrogen economy of FCVs with renewable H 2 pathway under current technology in real projects. Based on the case of transit buses in Zhangjiakou city in north China, this research provides an understanding of cost details of the hydrogen pathway and FCB operation as well as a solution to commercialize FCVs in areas with rich renewable resources.",

With these early experiences, China gradually changed its marketing focus to commercial vehicles especially buses as the breakthrough of its ambitious plan of producing 100,000 FCVs by 2030 [29, 33] . Unlike the developed countries that have already demonstrated dozens of FCBs accumulatively, China has demonstrated no more than 6 buses for each of its previous programs [16] . These programs in China tested FCBs with H 2 supply from water electrolysis by grid electricity and feedstock H 2 from the chemical industry, both relied heavily on fossil fuels from the life cycle perspective considering that 60% of China's grid electricity was from coal at that time [34] . The existing H 2 pathways cannot provide life-cycle carbonfree H 2 nor a competitive H 2 price for FCBs, thus, increasing the utility of renewable electricity with low-price to produce H 2 becomes a practical way to realize both economics and zero-emission of FCB commercialization [6] . As a result, the regions with rich renewable resources become hot spots for carbon-free H 2 production and FCV deployment. Among these regions, Hebei is the first province that explicitly declared its plan of using renewable electricity to produce H 2 and has deployed fuel cell transit buses for over one year on a smallscale basis in Zhangjiakou city since September 2018 [35] .",

Thus, the 74 buses operating on Zhangjiakou public routes since October 2018 can obtain 500,000 RMB fiscal subsidy for each bus. Though the future purchasing subsidy for FCB is unclear for the years after 2020, the phase-down trend of financial subsidy for purchasing NEVs has been determined in China that the purchasing subsidy from the central government will be gradually decreased. Moreover, from 2019, the purchasing subsidy for FCBs will be granted by two payments until the buses have fulfilled 20,000 km service on road [40] . However, the local governments can keep on providing purchasing subsidies for transit buses instead of other vehicle models.

Fig. 4 shows that the year 2022 is the turning point of the H 2 pathway cost because of the large scale of bus operation and H 2 station deployment before the Winter Olympics. The end cost of H 2 for transit buses will reduce to 17.82 RMB/kg in 2022, much cheaper than the curtailed price i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y x x x ( x x x x ) x x x of 35 RMB/kg. However, as the incremental transit buses and refueling stations have been put into service mainly during 2019e2022, the cost of the H 2 pathway during that period is much higher than the curtailed selling price, reaching its peak of 66.62 RMB/kg in 2020. As a result, the H 2 pathway system in the Zhangjiakou transit bus project has to bear years of deficit before it starts to make profits. The profit of the H 2 pathway during 2022e2025 is higher than that in the later years, as high as 18.7 RMB/kg can be earned in 2025. The profit goes down with the reduction of curtailed selling price and the maturity of technology and market, that during 2031e2035 the profit reduces to 8.03 RMB/kg-H 2 in 2035. From 2022, the costing structure of the H 2 pathway will maintain relatively stable during each planning timeframe. The electrolysis system (AC) cost will be the lowest of 7.5 RMB/ kg-H 2 in 2030, in which year the system efficiency will reach its technology maximum. The H 2 transport system takes the smallest share of the pathway cost, that it will need 2.72e2.74 RMB for 1 kg H 2 carried by trailers with 300 bar vessels during 2022e2025, and 1.53e1.57 RMB/kg under 500 bar from 2026.

With the increasing business scale of FCBs on road, the station operators can make profits in the long term. Then, to guarantee the continuity of refueling business for the station constructors such as \"franchise right of operation\" would be beneficial to attract initial investment, which could only be paid back after many years of business until the vehicles on road reach enough scale.",

The cost of the FCB fleet service also lies heavily in the initial investment. Despite the bus purchasing subsidy and the competitive fuel economy, the life cycle cost of the FCBs will continue to be more expensive than the diesel ones in the next 10 years. The coming CO 2 trading scheme will be a remedy for such a big investment. A reasonable expectation of the future carbon price would be 1000e2000 RMB/ton [53] , which could be very attractive for bus operators to gradually phase out their diesel buses. However, the most important benefit of FCB operation is not the monetary feedback directly from carbon sales which have been uncertain yet, but the social benefits from the environment, as well as the potential disincentives such as road limit that could cause inconvenience to diesel buses on road.",

Though the calculation of the costing details was based on assumptions and only transit buses were considered, the FC transit bus project in Zhangjiakou offered a cost detail in each sector and proved that low electricity price, localization of H 2 supply and curtailed end price of refueling could be a solution for renewable H 2 economy in a long run. Generally, when the local H 2 plant opens, the H 2 pathway cost mainly lies in the sectors of water electrolysis and refueling. So the selling price of renewable electricity and the end price of H 2 refueling are the most important factors for the long-term profitability of the Zhangjiakou project.",
