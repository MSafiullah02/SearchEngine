The COVID-19 has been affirmed to have human-to-human transmissibility (C. Wang et al., 2020; M. Wang et al., 2020), which raised high attention not only in China but internationally. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that there are 118,319 confirmed cases and 4292 deaths globally until March 11, 2020 (WHO, 2020a), and evaluated as global pandemic on the same day (WHO, 2020b).",

It has been documented that the temperature and its variations might have affected the SARS outbreak (Tan, 2005). A study in Korea found that the risk of influenza incidence was significantly increased with low daily temperature and low relative humidity, a positive significant association was observed for diurnal temperature range (DTR) (Park et al., 2019). Moreover, temperature (Pinheiro et al., 2014) and DTR (Luo et al., 2013) have been linked to the death from respiratory diseases. A study demonstrated that absolute humidity had significant correlations with influenza viral survival and transmission rates (Metz and Finn, 2015). Few studies reported that the COVID-19 was related to the meteorological factors, which decreased with the temperature increasing (Oliveiros et al., 2020; C. Wang et al., 2020; M. Wang et al., 2020), but their effects on the mortality have not been reported. Therefore, we assume that the weather conditions might also contributed to the mortality of COVID-19.",

The density of water vapor, or absolute humidity [\u03c1v (g/m3)], is the mass of moisture per total volume of air. It is associated to VP via the ideal gas law for the moist portion of the air:(1)\u03c1v=1000\u2217eRvTwhere e is vapor pressure (VP), Rv is the gas constant for water vapor [461.53 J/(kg K)], and T is the daily ambient temperature (K). VP is a commonly used indicator of absolute humidity and is calculated from ambient temperature and relative humidity using the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation (Shaman and Kohn, 2009). Briefly, we first calculated the saturation vapor pressure [es (T) (mb)] from daily ambient temperature using the following equation:(2)esT=esT0\u2217expLRv1T0\u22121Twhere es (T0) denotes saturation vapor pressure at a reference temperature T0 (273.15 K) which equals to 6.11 mb. L denotes the latent heat of evaporation for water (2257 kJ/kg). Rv is the gas constant for water vapor [461.53 J/(kg K)]. T denotes daily ambient temperature (K). Then, VP (Pa) was calculated by combining the es (T) calculated using Eq. (2) with relative humidity (RH):(3)VP=100\u2217esT\u2217RH100\n",

We used GAM to analyze the associations between meteorological factors (temperature, DTR, relative humidity and absolute humidity) and the daily death counts of COVID-19. The core analysis was a GAM with a quasi-Poisson link function based on the previous studies (Almeida et al., 2010; Basu et al., 2008). We first built the basic models for death outcomes without including air pollution or weather variables. We incorporated smoothed spline functions of time, which accommodate nonlinear and nonmonotonic patterns between mortality and time, thus offering a flexible modeling tool. Then, we introduced the weather variables and analyzed their effects on mortality. Akaike's information criterion was used as a measure of how well the model fitted the data. Consistent with several recent time-series studies (Cheng and Kan, 2012; Zeng et al., 2016), the penalized smoothing spline function was applied to control the effects of confounding factors, such as time trends, day-of-week and air pollution. The core GAM equation is:logEYt=\u03b1+\u03b2Xt+sTimek=df+1+sPollutantsk=df+1+DOWwhere t is the day of the observation; E(Yt) is the expected number of daily mortality for COVID-19 on day t; \u03b1 is the intercept; \u03b2 is the regression coefficient; Xt is the daily level of weather variables on day t; s() denotes the smoother based on the penalized smoothing spline. Based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC), the 2 degrees of freedom (df) is used for time trends and 3 df for air pollutants, temperature and relative humidity; DOW is a categorical variable indicating the date of the week.",

Couple of studies reported that respiratory diseases mortality increased with decreasing temperature (Fallah and Mayvaneh, 2016), and was strongly associated with low temperature (Dadbakhsh et al., 2017; G\u00f3mez-Acebo et al., 2013; Macfarlane, 1977). While another study found that both cold and heat effects might have adverse impacts on respiratory mortality (Li et al., 2019). Otherwise, the study conducted in 30 East Asian cities showed that increased DTR was associated with increased risk of mortality for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Kim et al., 2016). In the cold season, the cumulative relative risk of non-accidental, respiratory and cardiovascular death increased at high DTR values in Tabriz (Sharafkhani et al., 2019). A time-series study conducted in Shanghai about the effect of DTR on daily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality showed that each 1 \u00b0C elevation in the 4-day moving average for DTR accounted for 1.25% of increased risk of COPD mortality (Song et al., 2008). A review for cold exposure and immune function reported that lower temperature may repress the immune function (Shephard and Shek, 1998). In particular, our previous finding suggested that the phagocytic function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages declined under cold stress in vitro experiment (Luo et al., 2017). Breathing cold air can lead to bronchial constriction, which may promote susceptibility to pulmonary infection (Martens, 1998). Additionally, since SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to heat, and high temperature makes it difficult to survive, not to mention the beneficial factors for virus transmission like indoor crowding and poor ventilation in cold days (Bunker et al., 2016). Also, cold temperature has been discovered to be associated with the reduction of lung function and increases in exacerbations for people with COPD (Donaldson et al., 1999). DTR represents a stable measure of temperature, which is an indicator of temperature variability to evaluate effects on human health, including mortality and morbidity (Easterling et al., 1997). Also, abrupt temperature changes may add to the burden of cardiac and respiratory system causing cardiopulmonary events and high DTR levels may be a source of environmental stress (Sharafkhani et al., 2019). It is said that the windows of inpatient wards were asked to remain open for 24 h a day and avoid using air conditioning in Wuhan hospitals due to ventilation necessity, therefore the indoor variation trend of meteorological factors could be very close to the outdoor environment. Concerning about this condition and our results, it is reasonable to sustain a stable and comfortable environment for the patients during therapy.",

A 25-year study found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality, and low-humidity levels might cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms (Barreca, 2012), similar to a study carried out in the United States (Barreca and Shimshack, 2012). Consistent to these findings, our results also indicate that the risk of dying from COVID-19 decreases only with absolute humidity increasing. Breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; The formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread (Lowen et al., 2007). Moreover, the transmission of pandemic influenza virus is efficient under cold, dry conditions (Steel et al., 2011), and influenza virus survival rate increased markedly in accordance with decreasing of absolute humidity (Shaman et al., 2009), which may be very similar to coronavirus. Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter.",

Our finding shows that the daily mortality of COVID-19 is positively associated with DTR but negatively with absolute humidity. In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may also be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality. And our results suggest that it is reasonable to sustain a stable and comfortable environment for the patients during therapy.",
