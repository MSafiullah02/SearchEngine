During the same period, malaria incidence rates declined by 25 % around the world and by 31 % in the African Region. However, this progress, a likely consequence of the global eradication program launched by charity foundations (Khadjavi et al. 2010 ) , is no cause for complacency. The absolute numbers of malaria cases and deaths are not going down as fast as they could. The disease still took an estimated 627,000 lives in 2012, mostly those of children under 5 years of age in Africa among more than 200 million clinical cases worldwide, of which 91 % were due to Plasmodium falciparum (WHO 2013 ). Malaria remains an alarming emergency in developing countries: an estimated 3.4 billion people were at risk of malaria in 2012. Of this total, 2.2 billion were at low risk (<1 reported case per 1,000 population), of whom 94 %",

Male mosquito does not feed on blood, hence only female serves as a vector. The saliva contains antihemostatic and anti-infl ammatory enzymes disrupting the clotting process and inhibiting the pain reaction. Typically, each infected bite contains 5-200 sporozoites which proceed to infect the human vector. Sporozoites stay for prolonged time in the skin before reaching the blood stream. Only the parasites surviving to phagocytes can rapidly enter the human bloodstream through a blood vessel, where they circulate for a matter of minutes before infecting liver cells (Ejigiri and Sinnis 2009 ).",

The schizont divides by schizogony, a type of asexual reproduction, in which multiple fi ssions result in the formation of a number of small, spindle-shaped uninucleate cells called merozoites (Rogier and Hommel 2011 ) . After schizonts rupture, merozoites are released into the sinusoids or venous passages of the liver. This phase of asexual reproduction is called preerythrocytic schizogony. The merozoites are immune to medicines and host natural resistance. After a development stage in liver, during which there are no clinical symptoms of the disease, merozoites are released into the blood and enter the erythrocytic portion of their life cycle. A single schizont can produce thousands of merozoites by asexual reproduction.",

In particular, major merozoite surface proteins (MSP)-1 and -9 bind to erythrocyte band 3 protein (Kariuki et al. 2005 ) , the merozoite orients its apical end towards the erythrocyte surface through merozoite apical membrane antigen-1 transmembrane protein (Mitchell et al. 2004 ) and penetrates in the RBC involving erythrocyte binding antigens and the P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding homologs, which binds glycophorins and other unknown receptors (Baum et al. 2005 ) . In P. vivax , reticulocyte invasion occurs after interaction with the Duffy blood group antigen, the erythrocyte receptor for the chemokine Interleukin-8/CXCL8. This antigen is generally missing in African population that is why P. vivax results more common in tropical areas other than Africa, such as Southern Asia and Malaysia (Horuk et al. 1993 ) . By invading the erythrocytes, the merozoites initiate the blood stage of the asexual cycle. The blood stage takes around 48 h to be completed. During this period, the parasites develop through several stages (ring, trophozoite, and schizont forms, respectively), characterized by different structures and specialized stage-specifi c features (Bannister et al. 2000 ) .",

The parasite eventually grows into the more rounded trophozoite form. During this stage most active feeding, growth, and RBC modifi cations occur. New molecules are exported into the RBC: some of them assemble into fl at membranous sacs of various forms, including Maurer's clefts, which are visible in stained smears (Aikawa et al. 1986 ; Atkinson and Aikawa 1990 ) . Other proteins interact with the RBC membrane and cytoskeleton to form small knobs (Atkinson and Aikawa 1990 ; Cooke 2000 ) on its surface. Some molecules such as P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein ( Pf EMP)1 allow the infected RBC to adhere to the vascular endothelium, thus counteracting the action of immune defenses aimed at removing parasites from the blood stream through the spleen. As a consequence of infected RBC cytoadherence to brain-blood vessel walls, some malaria complications may occur, including cerebral malaria (Adams 2002 ) and placental malaria (Scherf et al. 2001 ) . Other exported molecules increase RBC permeability to nutrients.

The toxins are liberated into the blood along with the liberation of merozoites and then deposed into the liver and the spleen or under the skin, so that the host gets a sallow color. The accumulated toxins cause malaria fever: the patient suffers from chills, shivering, sweating, high temperature headache, abdominal and back pain, nausea, diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting. The fever lasts for 6-10 h and then it comes again after every 48 h with the liberation of a new generation of merozoites. During the erythrocytic stage, some merozoites increase in size to form two types of gametocytes, the macrogametocytes and microgametocytes. The macrogametocytes (female) are large, round with the food-laden cytoplasm and a small eccentric nucleus. The microgametocytes (male) are small, with clear cytoplasm and a large central nucleus. This process is called gametocytogenesis. The specifi c factors underlying this sexual differentiation are largely unknown. The gametocytes take roughly 8-10 days to reach full maturity and do not develop further until they get sucked by the appropriate species of mosquito. If this does not happen, they degenerate and die, since they require lower temperature for further development ).",

Only the gametocytes survive inside the stomach, while the other forms of the parasites, as well as the erythrocytes, are digested. Two types of gametes are formed: microgametocyte (male) and the macrogametocyte (female). The microgametocytes become active and their nucleus divides to produce 6-8 haploid daughter nuclei. The nuclei arrange at the periphery. The cytoplasm gives out the same number of fl agella-like projections. A daughter nucleus enters in each projection. These projections separate from the cytoplasm. This process of formation of microgametes is called exfl agellation. From each microgametocyte, 6-8 fl agella-like active microgametes are formed. The megagametocyte undergoes some reorganization and forms the megagametes. Fertilization of the female gamete by the male gamete occurs rapidly after gametogenesis. The fertilization event produces a zygote that remains inactive for some time and then elongates into a wormlike ookinete or vermicule. The zygote and ookinete are the only diploid stages. The ookinete penetrates the wall of the stomach and comes to lie below its outer epithelial layer. It gets enclosed in a cyst formed partly by the zygote and partly by the stomach of mosquito. The encysted zygote is called oocyst. The oocysts absorb nourishment and grow to about fi ve times in size. They protrude from the surface of the stomach as transparent rounded structures. Over a period of 1-3 weeks, the oocyst grows to a size of tens to hundreds of micrometers. During this time, multiple nuclear divisions occur. As a consequence of oocyst maturation, the oocyst divides to form multiple haploid sporozoites. Each oocyst may contain thousands of sporozoites and groups of sporozoites get arranged around the vacuoles. This phase of asexual multiplication is known as sporogony. In the mosquito, the whole sexual cycle is completed in 10-21 days. Finally the oocyst bursts and sporozoites are liberated into the hemolymph of the mosquito. They spread throughout the hemolymph and eventually reach the salivary glands and enter the duct of the hypopharynx. The mosquito now becomes infective and the sporozoites get inoculated or injected into the human blood when the mosquito bites, starting a new life cycle. It is estimated that a single infected mosquito may contain as many as 200,000 sporozoites ).",

This process occurs mostly inside the food vacuole of the parasite that in P. falciparum is an acidic structure with an estimated pH of 5.0-5.4 (Krogstad et al. 1985 ; Klonis et al. 2007 ). The digestive vacuole lacks the characteristic lysosomal phosphatases and glycosidases present in the vacuoles of other organisms and is dedicated almost exclusively to hemoglobin degradation. Such an event was believed to play a vital role for malaria parasites, being an essential source of nutrients and energy (Francis et al. 1997 ) , as they had been observed to have a limited capacity to synthesize them on their own (Coronado et al. 2014 ). However, this process generates heme, which is highly toxic to the parasites. The parasite is unable to excrete free toxic heme and does not possess any heme oxygenases, a class of enzymes responsible for the degradation of the heme moiety. Therefore, Plasmodium aggregates the heme monomer into an insoluble inert biocrystal called malarial pigment or Hz (Slater 1992 ) . In particular, during hemoglobin digestion, alphahematin (ferriprotoporphyrin IX), which is toxic to the parasite, is released (Orjih 2001 ) and-most possibly as a protection strategy for the parasite-transformed into Hz (chemically identical to beta-hematin), a molecule with paramagnetic properties.",

This unusual linkage allows the heme units to be aggregated into an ordered insoluble crystal, representing a unique way of heme processing (Slater et al. 1991 ) . It is now well known that Hz is composed of hematin molecules bonded by reciprocal iron-carboxylate bonds to the propionic side chains of each porphyrin to form dimers, which are further connected via hydrogen bonds to form a triclinic crystal (Pagola et al. 2000 ) . This was concluded through photoacoustic spectroscopy (Balasubramanian et al. 1984 ) and corroborated more recently by using betahematin DMSO solvate, being this the fi rst Fe(III) PPIX model of Hz studied by single crystal X-ray diffraction (Gildenhuys et al. 2013 ).",

However, impaired Hz-laden human monocytes do not undergo apoptosis: apparently, Hz-dependent enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic HSP-27 leads to prolonged monocyte survival, thereby contributing to maintain the impaired monocytes in the bloodstream Prato et al. 2010a ). Moreover, Hz-fed monocytes show enhanced gene expression of a large number of proinfl ammatory molecules, including cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-1RA) and chemokines (MIP-1alpha/CCL-3, MIP-1beta/CCL-4, GROalpha/ CXCL-1, GRObeta/CXCL-2, GROgamma/CXCL-3, MCP-1/CCL-2, IL-8/CXCL-8, ENA-78/CXCL-5) . Hz also upregulates the expression and activity of few monocytic enzymes. As more extensively reviewed previously (Prato and Giribaldi 2011 ) , Hz was shown in a series of works to increase RNA/protein expression, protein release, and proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a cytokine-related proteolytic enzyme that has been proposed to participate in a mechanism that could explain the remarkable release of cytokines in malaria infection. Indeed, cytokines such as TNFalpha and IL-1beta are able to induce the expression and activity of MMP-9 in culture of monocytes after phagocytosis of Hz (Prato et al. 2005 (Prato et al. , 2008 . Higher levels of MMP-9 were also found in brain of cerebral malaria-sensitive P. berghei -infected mice and it was shown by immunohistochemistry that the monocytic cells were responsible for this production (Van den Steen et al. 2006 ). Since MMP-9 gene transcription is induced by TNFalpha and active MMP-9 can shed membrane-bound TNFalpha into the extracellular environment through proteolytic cleavage, a pathological loop involving TNFalpha and MMP-9 is established, leading to abnormal levels of cytokine production (Prato et al. 2005 ) . Data from in vitro cultures of human monocytes showed that some peroxidated lipids attached to Hz may play a crucial role either in enhanced MMP-9 expression and activity or in TNFalpha and IL-1beta production (Prato et al. 2008 (Prato et al. , 2010b . On the other side, it has been shown that lipid-free synthetic pigment beta-hematin is able to perform cleavage of the proform of MMP-9 in vitro suggesting that heme core may concur in its activation (Geurts et al. 2008 ) . As such, the interaction between Hz and MMP-9 appears a promising research fi eld for new therapies in complicated malaria, also taking in account that drugs against these enzymes are already available because of their role in other diseases, including cancer and neuroinfl ammation.",

Although the pathophysiology of malaria is multifactorial and only partially understood, there are some important interactions between the parasite and the host that can determine the clinical outcome of the disease: endemicity patterns, acquisition of naturally acquired malarial immunity, parasite virulence, multiplication rate, antigenic variation, polymorphic variability in either human host or Plasmodium parasite, and age (Newton and Krishna 1998 ; Abdalla and Pasvol 2004 ) . It is well known that children typically display enhanced susceptibility to SMA, while nonresident malaria na\u00efve adults progress towards ARF and RD due to pulmonary edema (White 1998 ).",

P. falciparum is unique as it causes mature infected RBC to sequester and adhere to microvascular beds in numerous organs. Unlike the other human malarial parasites which rarely cause neurological dysfunction, P. falciparum -induced CM often leads to death or severe neurological sequelae (Grau and Craig 2012 ). However, P. falciparum appears to remain in the vascular space without ever entering the brain parenchyma, thus raising question of how intravascular Plasmodium parasites are capable of inducing a devastating neural dysfunction in CM. Recent evidence suggests that a compromised integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) results in a subsequent increase in BBB permeability which enables toxic soluble factors released by either host or parasite to cross this barrier and exert neurological effects (Coltel et al 2004 ) .",

CM appears as a diffuse encephalopathy commonly presenting with headache, agitation, frank psychosis, seizures and impaired consciousness, and occa-sionally with brainstem signs or focal neurological signs such as hemiplegia and cranial nerve palsies (Newton and Warrel 1998 ; Gitau and Newton 2005 ) . It is diffi cult to confi rm diagnoses of CM in endemic areas because of overlapping infections such as bacterial meningitis in patients showing incidental malarial parasitemia (Berkley et al. 1999 ) . Children from areas endemic for malaria or nonimmune adults traveling from developed countries are at higher risk for developing CM. On the contrary, CM is rarely encountered in >10-year-old patients who have been exposed to P. falciparum since birth. Mortality ranges from 15 to 30 %, and 11 % of children display neurological defi cits upon discharge (Newton and Warrel 1998 ) .",

There are currently three distinct theories on the etiology of CM typical features: (1) the mechanical hypothesis; (2) the permeability hypothesis; and (3) the humoral hypothesis (Polimeni and Prato 2014 ) . The mechanical hypothesis proposes that CM is caused by a mechanical obstruction of the cerebral microvasculature by infected RBC, with coma resulting from impaired brain perfusion (Pino et al. 2005 ) . The permeability hypothesis suggests that a leaky BBB allows toxic compounds to enter the brain and cause neurological dysfunction (Gitau and Newton 2005 ) . Such a hypothesis has been natural extended to the humoral hypothesis, conceiving that host factors such as leukocyte-derived cytokines and chemokines can enter the brain parenchyma after reduced BBB integrity, thus causing CM symptoms such as fever and coma (Pino et al. 2005 ; Gitau and Newton 2005 ) .",

Indeed, to tentatively control the parasitemia, the host releases a large array of pro-and anti-infl ammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and effector molecules as part of the innate immune response. However, the immune response to malaria can result in successful control of the parasitemia only depending on the magnitude and timing of the release of infl ammatory mediators. If the infl ammatory milieu is not properly balanced, it can seriously damage the host, also suppressing the erythropoietic response. They also show as some parasitic products drive the innate immune response in the infected human host, including Hz, glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), and parasitic antigens. Phagocytosis of Hz by circulating monocytes, neutrophils, and resident macrophages represents a primary factor for stimulating the innate immune response to P. falciparum. Among other mechanisms, Hz generates an innate immune response through the toll-like receptor (TLR) system.",

This is mainly due to the accumulation of lactate, produced by the parasite or by peripheral tissues in hypoxic conditions. Metabolic acidosis is often worsened by renal dysfunction. As a consequence of lower blood pH, respiratory rates are increased to expel more carbon dioxide, resulting in hyperventilation. Therefore, hyperventilation should be considered a peripheral or renal pathology rather than pulmonary (Van den Steen et al. 2013 ) . Whether hyperventilation may contribute to pulmonary edema-for instance by prolonged high tidal volume breathing-is currently topic of debate, and the simultaneous occurrence of both events cannot be excluded (Nayak et al. 2011 ) . Hyperventilation represents the main respiratory distress occurring in African children with malaria and is also frequent in adults (Marsh et al. 1995 ; English et al. 1996 ) .",

It is characterized by marked, diffuse alveolar infl ammation, damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, alveolar edema, and severe hypoxemia. Common causes of ARDS include sepsis, bacterial or viral infectious diseases, and aspiration pneumonia ( Matthay and Zemans 2011 ; Wheeler and Bernard 2007 ) , all factors that are often concomitant in malaria patients. However, ARDS may also present as a severe complication of malaria independently of any other cause (Taylor et al. 2006 (Taylor et al. , 2012 Mohan et al. 2008 ) . Malaria-associated (MA)-ARDS occurs mainly in adults and lethality rates reach 80 % of patients, despite antimalarial treatment. The largest part of ARDS cases is registered in adult patients in low-transmission areas, as well as in nonimmune travelers. On the contrary, resident adults from high-transmission areas appear semi-immune and protected against severe malaria. Pregnant women with placental malaria are also at higher risk to develop MA-ARDS (Taylor et al. 2006 (Taylor et al. , 2012 Mohan et al. 2008 ). Depending on the study area and the parasite species, the estimated prevalence rates range from 2 to 20 % in adults with severe malaria (see Mohan et al. 2008 for a more detailed review). Several case reports have been published for each human malaria parasite species. MA-ARDS appears to be the most prevalent complication of Plasmodium knowlesi infections (59-70 % of severe cases) (Daneshvar et al. 2009 ; William et al. 2011 ) . Notably, besides antimalarial chemotherapy, positive pressure ventilation measures are currently the only available remedy. ARDS has been proposed to likely represent the most extreme form of pulmonary involvement in malaria (Maguire et al. 2005 ) .",

ARF generally occurs in nonimmune adults and older children (Eiam-Ong and Sitprija 1998 ; Barsoum 2000 ; Eiam-Ong 2003 ) . Indeed, ARF results largely higher in patients from non-malarious regions than in the areas with high malaria transmission rates. According to one report, ARF incidence is as high as that of CM (Weber et al. 1991 ) . The mechanism underlying malarial ARF remains unknown so far. The manifestations vary from milder forms (e.g., prerenal azotemia) to more severe forms (ischemic ARF), depending on the degree of renal hypoperfusion. Mechanical obstruction by infected erythrocytes, immune-mediated glomerular and tubular pathologies, fl uid loss due to multiple mechanisms, and alterations in the renal microcirculation, should be listed among the most credited hypotheses. Restricted local blood fl ow in the kidneys is considered to play a major role in development of malarial ARF. Low intake or high loss of fl uids as a consequence of vomiting and pyrexial sweating could be responsible for dehydration and renal ischemia. Increased fl uid administration, oxygen toxicity, and yet unidentifi ed factors may contribute to pulmonary edema, ARDS, multiorgan failure, and death. Currently, the mainstay treatment consists of appropriate antimalarial drug therapy, fl uid replacement, and renal replacement therapy (Das 2008 ) .",

The merozoites infect the erythrocyte and modify into \"ring stage.\" The ring form of the parasite enlarges and grows into the trophozoite form. The parasite converts hemoglobin into dark crystal particles to form the malarial pigment (Hz). The trophozoites metamorphose into schizonts that divide to form daughter nuclei of new merozoite cells in the erythrocyte. Finally the merozoites burst from the RBC, proceeding to infect other erythrocytes",
