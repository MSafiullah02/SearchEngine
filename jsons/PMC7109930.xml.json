            "text": "High-throughput DNA sequencing instrumentation capable of producing tens of millions of short (\u223c25 bp) sequences (reads) is becoming available (Bennett, 2004). The two most striking attributes of this technology, the large read depth and short sequence length, make it suitable for re-sequencing applications where a known reference sequence is used as a template for alignment. However, the ability to decode novel sequencing targets, such as unsequenced genomes or metagenomic libraries is limited. Twenty-five mers are far more ubiquitous than Sanger-size reads (500\u20131000 bp) in any given genome. Since the sequence complexity increases by a factor 4 for every base added, the likelihood of observing redundant sequences increases dramatically with decreased read length for sequences shorter than 20 bp. The read length needed to achieve maximal uniqueness varies depending on the genome being sequenced, its size and repeat content (Whiteford et al., 2005). Although some studies have explored the feasibility of de novo genome assembly using 70\u201380 bp reads (Chaisson et al., 2004), none describe tools for de novo assembly of shorter sequences.",

The Short Sequence Assembly by progressive K-mer search and 3\u2032 read Extension (SSAKE) program cycles through sequence data stored in a hash table, and progressively searches through a prefix tree for the longest possible k-mer between any two sequences. We ran the algorithm on simulated error-free 25mers from the bacteriophage PhiX174 (Sanger et al., 1977), coronavirus SARS TOR2 (Marra et al., 2003), bacteria Haemophilus influenzae (Fleischmann et al., 1995) genomes and on 40 million 25mers from the whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequence data from the Sargasso sea metagenomics project (Venter et al., 2004). Our results indicate that SSAKE could be used for complete assembly of sequencing targets that are 30 kb in length (e.g. viral targets) and to cluster millions of identical short sequences from a complex microbial community.",

Sequences were selected at random to simulate up to 400\u00d7 read coverage for the viral genomes and up to 100\u00d7 read coverage for H.influenzae.

A prefix tree is used to organize the sequences and their reverse-complemented counterparts by their first eleven 5\u2032 end bases. The sequence reads are sorted by decreasing number of occurrences to reflect coverage and minimize extension of reads containing sequencing errors. Each unassembled read, u, is used in turn to nucleate an assembly. Each possible 3\u2032 most k-mer is generated from u and is used for the search until the word length is smaller than a user-defined minimum, m, or until the k-mer has a perfect match with the 5\u2032 end bases of read r. In that latter case, u is extended by the unmatched 3\u2032 end bases contained in r, and r is removed from the hash table and prefix tree. The process of cycling through progressively shorter 3\u2032-most k-mers is repeated after every extension of u. Since only left-most searches are possible with a prefix tree, when all possibilities have been exhausted for the 3\u2032 extension, the complementary strand of the contiguous sequence generated (contig) is used to extend the contig on the 5\u2032 end. The DNA prefix tree is used to limit the search space by efficiently binning the sequence reads. There are two ways to control the stringency in SSAKE. The first is to stop the extension when a k-mer matches the 5\u2032 end of more than one sequence read (\u2212s 1). This leads to shorter contigs, but minimizes sequence misassemblies. The second is to stop the extension when a k-mer is smaller than a user-set minimum word length (m). SSAKE outputs a log file with run information along with two multi fasta files, one containing all sequence contigs constructed and the other containing the unassembled sequence reads.",

On the same hardware, we were able to assemble the SARS-associated coronavirus de novo into a single contig having 99.91% sequencing identity with the genome. The read coverage needed to achieve this was 20 times higher than for PhiX174. Increased coverage was needed to insure only one valid path could be taken to assemble all reads. Assembly of H.influenzae reads was impaired by the presence, in the genome, of 28 perfectly repeated segments ranging in size from 70 to 5723 bases and 29 766 repeated 25mers. At best, we were able to assemble 7.3 million sequence reads into 284 contigs equal or larger than 75 bp and totaling 1.78 Mb. Of these contigs, 241 showed single, unique, full-length alignments to H.influenzae, and covered 1007 kb (54.62% of the genome) with 99.43% sequence identity. The remaining 43 contigs totaled 776 kb and all incorporated k-mers that mapped to repeats, causing broken alignments between the contigs and the genome.",

Up to 11% of the reads used as input to SSAKE were assembled into contigs equal or larger than 100 bp, totaling 12.8 Mb. Unassembled reads accounted for 32.5% of the input sequences. The remaining reads were found in short contigs (26\u201399 bp). To evaluate assembly accuracy, we aligned all contigs \u2265100 bp to a publicly available assembly of the Sargasso Sea WGS data using wuBLAST (Gish, 1996\u20132005, ). For this assembly, 99.6% of SSAKE contigs aligned to known Sargasso Sea contigs. The overall sequence identity of SSAKE contigs was 92.3%. Perfect alignments would not necessarily be expected due to the non-clonal nature of the members of this microbial community (Venter et al., 2004). We benchmarked SSAKE on two separate Opteron computers (described above) using sets of 1 k, 10 k, 100 k, 1 M, 2 M, 5 M 10 M and 40 M random 25mers simulated from the Sargasso Sea metagenomics WGS data. We found that the assembly running time followed a linear trend on both machines (data not shown). Consistent with this trend, a fast 2.2 GHz computer chip with sufficient RAM (32 GB) would assemble 40 M sequences in ca. 10 h.",

For larger and more complex sequencing targets, such as bacterial genomes, short reads can be rapidly and stringently assembled into contigs that accurately represent the non-repetitive portion of the genome. It is clear that the best approach for de novo sequencing of targets more complex than viral genomes will likely involve some combination of Sanger reads and assembled short reads. For metagenomics, our simulation involving 40 M short reads from the Sargasso Sea WGS data indicate that these types of reads can be used to produce conservative contigs in a robust and tractable manner, while minimizing probabilistic errors. As a stringent, efficient assembly tool SSAKE is expected to have broad application in de novo sequencing.",
