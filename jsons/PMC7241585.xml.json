We are accepting contributions in a form of special issues or individual manuscripts focusing on research and theoretical constructs geared at advancing and guiding research methodology for a variety of topics related to psycholinguistics. Below are some of the themes to consider:Semantic analysis of medical misinformation on social media during the Covid-19 pandemicUsing public figures as case studies for how language has changed during the course of the pandemic. Using their social media posts over time to provide linguistic data.Analysis of pandemic narratives. Asking people to speak about their experience of being isolated, how their memory (for what category) may be affected, what gives them comfort, changes in perceptions and language expression, etc.Linguistic content analysis of individuals with or without a previous history of traumaIssues related to differential effect of increased emotional concern (fear/anxiety, etc.) on language learning and language performance in children, young adults, and the elder populationsImpact of change in attentional preoccupation on language functioningImpact of COVID-19 on specific mechanism involved in reading, writing, concept formation, abstract thinking, etc.Difference and quality of metaphor and changes in dimension of metaphor in general population, children, elderly in relation to the Coronavirus experienceMetaphor interpretation and reading abilityOrganization in speech eventsSpeech perception in its multilevel processing systemCoding and sentence retrievalChanging in propositional reasoning with or without propositionDevelopment of young children\u2019s awareness of words, syntax, grammatical structures, etc.Children\u2019s conversational repairsParsing strategies and discourse contextChanges in comprehension of complex sentences: A Developmental analysisFunction of stages in the acquisition of syntaxImpact of emotional conflicts in voluntary and involuntary component of speechProcessing of idioms with multiple meaningsEffect of gender and topic on speech processing, production, stylesSemantic and syntactic processing in monolingual and bilingualsConditional reasoning and semantic contextUnderstanding and processing linguistic time sequenceChildren\u2019s Knowledge of propositional phrase structureChildren\u2019s concept of wordIdentifying deception in language communicationChanges in electrophysiological correlates of semantic featuresImpact of increased emotionality and ambiguity in Dyslexic individuals\u2019 reading and language processing/productionImpact of ambiguity on language perception and judgment of intentionality in normal and paranoid subjectsChanges in linguistic markers: Concepts of health, illness, and diseaseSemantic and pragmatic factors in the representation of near and far or spatial dimensionsLanguage acquisition and children\u2019s representation of knowledgePerception of stress contrasts in semantic and nonsemantic contexts by children and adultChanging in mentalism and language productionBilingual frequency encodingInput/output switch in bilingual code-switching of ordinary and emotionally-laden contentEffect of stress on linguistic generalization in bilingualsLanguage processing and language organization in bilingual populationSpeed perception: Word recognition in foreign languageProcessing of COVID-19 experience among the deaf and mute populationsSemantic and phonemic verbal fluency in blindsEtc.",
