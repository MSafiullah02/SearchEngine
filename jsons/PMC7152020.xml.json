The most common means by which contagious diseases are introduced to a herd involves introduction of new animals or the return to the herd of animals that had been on other premises or locations. Obviously, introduction of animals displaying any clinical signs of disease must be avoided. Importantly, producers must be educated that mere exclusion of clinically ill animals is unlikely to prevent introduction of disease. Often, animals that appear clinically normal may be incubating disease or be subclinically affected. It is well documented that in a given population of animals, only a fraction of those infected typically exhibit clinical disease, the larger proportion being subclinically affected. Consequently, appropriate and effective efforts in biosecurity must focus on the entire population of animals, rather than simply concentrating on those that are clinically affected.",

Instead, FPT in crias generally results from a failure to nurse appropriately within the first hours of life. Factors associated with crias that do not nurse appropriately include neonatal maladjustment (cerebral hypoxia), cleft palate, choanal atresia, fractures or other conditions that limit mobility or nursing. Hypothermia or misadventure may result if crias are born unsupervised or at pasture. Maternal factors associated with FPT include mismothering, teat or udder abnormalities, agalactia, or conditions causing recumbency of the dam.

The basic foundation for immunizing camelids is, therefore, limited and includes immunization against Clostridia organisms such as Clostridium perfringens types C and D and C. tetani toxoids. A killed rabies vaccine and a leptospirosis bacterin may be used if either disease is endemic. Although other vaccines have been administered to camelids, it is recommended that any modified-live virus vaccine or live bacteria product be used with caution in an extra-label manner. Finally, information concerning the scheduling of vaccination in camelids is limited at this time.

Today, camelids commonly reside in environments varying from pasture settings with low population density to dry lots with barns or enclosures with high population density. Specific risk factors include housing (e.g., barns, pastures); physical environment (e.g., bedding, animal exposure, cleaning and disinfection); general hygiene; miscellaneous stresses such as transportation and handling, and atmospheric conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, ventilation).

Sprinkling systems that spray the camelids' ventrum and wading ponds may be effective. In severe conditions, air-conditioned stalls may be necessary.

On smooth impervious surfaces such as metal or plastic, washing with soap and water to remove visible contamination will result in the elimination of approximately 99% of the microbial load. Similar washing of typical household surfaces removes approximately 90% of the microbial load. It can be presumed that washing of rough lumber will remove even less microorganisms.
