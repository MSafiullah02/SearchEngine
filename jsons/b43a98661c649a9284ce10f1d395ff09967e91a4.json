Then biomedical researchers can inspect this short list for further wet-lab validation. The ensemble of many models allow DeepPurpose to use different encoding algorithms (i.e., input representations), which broaden the search horizons and catches drugs that were missed by existing works due to the bias from only using one particular encoding model. DeepPurpose also allows users to input customized drug-target training data for specific target protein to train a new model from scratch.",

Out of the 81 antiviral drugs in the library, DeepPurpose recommend 13 potentially active drugs that have Kd values within 500 7 units. We conduct literature search for the 13 drugs and find that Ritonavir, Darunavir, Lopinavir are three of few drug candidates that are currently undergo clinical trials for SARS-CoV2-3CLPro [8] [9] [10] . The top recommendating drug Sofosbuvir is an anti-HCV protein inhibitors and is currently undergo many in-vitro investigations for its potential usage for COVID19 11 .

Figure. 2) using 7:1:2 train:validation:test split. We see all five models achieve high performance on all the metrics in the test set. Since in many cases the users may use drug-target pairs that are different from the training dataset, to test model's generalizability, we test on the DAVIS dataset 14 , which has zero overlap with the pretraining BindingDB dataset. We then sample 1,000 unseen drug-target pairs from DAVIS and feed them into the pretrained models.

We still consider the 3CL Protease for repurposing for COVID-19, but in this case, a biomedical scientist wants to train a deep learning model from past bioassay data such as high throughput screening (HTS) assay on SARS-CoV 3CL Protease 15 , which conserves 96% of gene with SARS-CoV-2. This is potentially a better training dataset than the general BindingDB dataset for COVID-19. Specifically, DeepPurpose takes the customized training dataset as input. DeepPurpose then trains multiple deep learning models using this assay data to score drug candidates from the antiviral library or any proprietary data (C, Figure. 2). This resulting candidate list has support from literature. We find most of them are protein synthesis inhibitors, which is consistent with the general 3CLPro inhibition mechanism. Specifically, in addition to the Ritonavir, it surprisingly outputs Remdesivir with high confidence, which is a star candidate for COVID19 by blocking the RNA polymerase and has shown initial clinical effects 16 . There are also initial literature evidence or clinical trials for Tipranavir 17 , Methisazone 18 , Baloxavir 19 , Indinavir 8 to tackle COVID-19. Since this bioassay has a binary label, DeepPurpose automatically switches from regression for binding affinity to binary classification by using different loss functions.",

This is due to most bioactive small molecules mediate their effects by interacting with proteins. If we can accurately identify potential off-target proteins or novel drug target interactions, then we will able to repurpose existing drugs with new therapeutic indications. DeepPurpose uses an encoder-decoder framework for drug target binding prediction. The input of DeepPurpose is a drug SMILES string and target amino acid sequence pair. The output of DeepPurpose is a score that measures the binding activity of the input drug target pair. The power of deep learning models comes from its ability to create predictive feature vectors also called embeddings. In particular, DeepPurpose encodes both input drug and target through various deep learning encoders to obtain their deep embeddings, then concatenates and feed them into a decoder, which is another deep neural network that aims to classify whether the input drug and target protein bind.",

DeepPurpose also includes numerous pretrained models on a large public dataset BindingDB and also models to reproduce previous works. This could significantly reduce the time and resource for users since they do not need to train the model from scratch. Using pretrained model is also desirable for a new target with low amount of training data since applying transfer learning could transfer existing knowledge learnt from a large model, thus reduce the amount of data to learn 33 . Instead of using one model for prediction as in most of the previous works, since DeepPurpose integrates numerous encodings in one framework, it can easily leverage the ensembling effect and use several models aggregation result for repurposing and virtual screening. This is valuable especially because different encodings look at different signals from drug/target. One model could potentially miss a very important drug candidate. By aggregating predicted binding scores/interaction probability from five models, we greatly reduce the likelihood of this scenario. We have three modes of aggregation: mean, max, and the average of mean and max. Mean is an overall performance measure across models but as some encodings may include signals that other 6/11 encodings cannot, the max is favorable. Hence, to leverage both advantages, we also include an aggregation scheme to take the average of mean and max. For the one-line default mode for biomedical scientists, we use the latter option.",

Second, binding affinity score such as Kd, IC50 are recorded in nM unit. However, the label distribution is very skewed.

For drug repurposing & virtual screening, given a drug library and a new target of interest or new drug-target pairs of interest, DeepPurpose feeds them into five pretrained models and the predictions are aggregated and ranked to generate a drug-target list.

Antiviral Drug Repurposing for SARS-CoV 3CLPro using Customized Training Dataset.In the third case study, we want to repurpose for SARS-CoV 3CL Protease using the SARS-CoV AID1706 bioassay training data and repurpose using the antiviral drug library. This can be done using: The data is loaded from three txt files. The training data split method is set to 'HTS' (High Throughput Screening) mode for one target processing, other split method includes random split, cold drug/target split. In this example, we train from scratch, hence, we set the 'pretrained' variable to 'False'. The training:validation:testing split is set to be 8:1:1 using the frac parameter. Under the hood, DeepPurpose first loads five models' configuration files and trains them using AID1706 bioassay data. Then, it feeds the drug repurposing data along with the 3CL target into the trained model and outputs an aggregated predicted probability and based on that, a ranked list of drug candidates.Case Study IV. Reproducing DeepDTA.Suppse we want to reproduce the DeepDTA 2 paper using DAVIS dataset 14 Note that the steps 2-6 is for training from scratch.
