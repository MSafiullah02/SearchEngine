Because Hong Kong and Taiwan are not member countries of the World Health Organization, although the former has observer status at the World Health Assembly, their health and health-care statistics are seldom published in international compendia, and comparative examination of the three systems has not been systematically undertaken and disseminated. The present article attempts to fill this gap in the literature.",

We then assess each system's performance on the equity and efficiency axes, in particular drawing on evidence from standardized health accounts and recent work by the 15-country, pan-Asian Equity in Asia-Pacific Health Systems or EQUITAP consortium. We show how policymakers are trying or might attempt to rise up to and overcome these key challenges in the medium- to long-term. Finally, we conclude with important lessons and various solution options that these three economies could learn from each other as well as across neighboring countries in East and South-East Asia.",

China's economic liberalization at the end of the 1970s was associated with a sharp drop in government fiscal revenues, and led to financial difficulties for many SOEs and a dismantling of village collective welfare funds (Zhu et al., 1989, Liu et al., 1995, Liu et al., 2001, Liu, 2002). The CMS all but collapsed, and GIS and LIS came under increasing financial strain. The government's initial response was to encourage government health facilities to supplement budget allocations with direct charges to patients. Despite increases in government health expenditure (GHE) (approximately 8% per year in real terms since the early 1990s), the public share of overall health spending declined steadily, reaching just 12% in 2003. Over the same period, government subsidies to providers accounted for a steadily declining share of operational expenses.",

Building on these experiences, a new urban employee health insurance system, the basic medical insurance (BMI), funded by a social coordinated medical fund in combination with personal medical savings accounts, was established in 1998. The scheme covers government agencies, state and collective enterprises, and private companies. Although the BMI aims at broad coverage, dependants of BMI participants, students, and the unemployed are not covered. Moreover, some employers, in particular in the private sector, have also opted to remain outside the scheme.",

Direct taxes contribute about one-half of government general revenue. Only 55% of the working population (3.3 million out of a total population of almost 6.9 million) in Hong Kong pay any income tax, and only the richest 1.4% of the working population fall into the top tax bracket (i.e. 16% flat tax), contributing 38.8% of total salaries tax receipts. Personal income tax constitutes one-third and corporate tax makes up one-half of all direct taxes. The remaining direct tax is property tax, which applies to the 60% of the population who live in private housing but not to the 40% that live in government-subsidized housing. Because of its colonial background, Hong Kong has reproduced a tax-financed system as per the UK National Health Service as it developed the welfare state since the 1970s. Government general revenue has funded most of hospital care, initially through publicly operated facilities and subvention of hospitals run by charities, and since 1991 these have been consolidated under the single corporatized umbrella of the Hospital Authority. In contrast, most of ambulatory care has always been privately financed and provided where OOP payments are common, amounting to about one-third of total health expenditure, with limited prospective payment arrangements through employer-provided (mostly multinationals or large local firms), and to a much lesser degree self-purchased, medical insurance.",

Collectively, this had covered about 57% of the total population by 1995. The 43% uninsured, mostly consisting of the two age extremes with the highest health-care need, were nevertheless deterred from seeking necessary medical services, which predictably resulted in socially patterned access to care, as in China progressively since the 1980s, that was consistent with Tudor Hart's Inverse Care Law (Tudor Hart, 2000).",

The government planned its new NHI system to achieve two essential objectives: providing equal access to health care for all citizens, and controlling total health spending within a reasonable level. The NHI provides a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive and medical services, prescription drugs, dental services, Chinese medicine, and home nurse visits (Lu and Hsiao, 2003). It is financed mainly through premiums (in the form of payroll tax) and supplemented with direct government funding, and it compensates a mixed health-care economy of public and private (dominant) providers predominantly on a fee-for-service basis (Chiang, 1997). Population coverage in the NHI scheme had reached 99% by the end of 2004 (International Symposium on Achievements and Challenges of National Health Systems, 2005). Therefore, both Taiwan and Hong Kong have now achieved universal coverage through social insurance and tax financing, respectively, which were instituted in tandem with their economic development (the former lags the latter by about 15 years).

Every city has a hospital practicing traditional Chinese medicine, and there are plans for expansion so that every county is covered (Hesketh and Zhu, 1997). Practitioners of Western allopathic medicine report a high level of acceptance and belief in traditional methods and medicines (Harmsworth and Lewith, 2001). Although there are dedicated facilities for traditional healing methods, most notably acupuncture and herbal remedies, as hospitals and clinics for Western medicine are organized independently, there is considerable overlap in the concurrent deployment of mixed-treatment modes in both types of care settings. Ninety-five percent of the Western hospitals also have departments of traditional Chinese medicine, and 40% of prescribed medicines are traditional (Zheng and Hiller, 1995).

Despite the sharpening of incentives that these reforms implied, they were not accompanied by effective regulation or provider payment reforms to limit overprovision of care. In fact, continued price regulation that set prices of basic services below cost, and those of high-tech services and drugs above cost, created strong incentives for providers to focus their attention on those services on which they could make a profit. These trends have continued to the present, resulting in provision of unnecessary care and contributing to the ensuing rapid cost escalation. The new financing arrangements also had an impact on public health institutions, which responded by introducing charges for some services that had previously been free, and by expanding their range of chargeable services. This has negatively affected the delivery of key population health interventions, such as immunization and tuberculosis control (Liu and Mills, 2002). Moreover, the heavy reliance on county financing for public health has resulted in large disparities in local capacity to implement disease prevention and control programs.",

Cost recovery has remained at 3\u20135% for inpatient care and 10\u201315% for outpatient visits. This predictably attracted away 10\u201315% of total bed-days from the private sector, further consolidating the already dominant market position of the public sector to 95% inpatient bed-days, whereas private providers have consistently looked after 70\u201385% of outpatient episodes, in a compartmentalized (between levels of care and at the public\u2013private interface) mixed medical economy (Hsiao et al., 1999, Leung et al., 2005). The HA, as a result of the economic downturn from the late 1990s until 2004 and the ever-upward cost spiral associated with technology diffusion, has sustained annual structural deficits since 2001. At the same time, the government has been handicapped by popular pressure (where most enjoy essentially free health care because of Hong Kong's narrow tax base and HA's universal entitlement policy), bureaucratic inertia, and political paralysis (arising from strained executive-legislative relations resulting from post-repatriation constitutional adjustments) from making any meaningful change to the system despite numerous consultancies and reports that have warned of an unsustainable future (Health and Welfare Bureau, 1993, Hsiao et al., 1999, Health and Welfare Bureau, 2001).",

For example, hospitals run large outpatient departments, the main purpose of which is to maintain a steady supply of inpatients. The Japanese policy of rapidly scaling up the supply of Western-style allopathic physicians and midwives extended into the Kuomintang-led era post-1945 (Hsiao et al., 1990); in contrast, the Japanese suppressed and eventually banned the practice of Chinese medicine, thus resulting in a drastic decrease of licensed Chinese medicine practitioners from 1903 to 24 (1901\u20131945) (Lin, 2004). Through the aggressive advocating of the Chinese medicine practitioners themselves, the government finally resumed the licensing system for them in 1947. To enhance its scientific attributes and gain market competitiveness, the practice of Chinese medicine has been modernized through establishing medical training programs within the formal medical school education system, which enrolls 270 medical students yearly (people can also obtain a license to practice through completing the Professional and Technical Special Examinations for Doctors of Chinese Medicine and undertaking an 18-month clinical training program) (Lin, 2004). Even though Chinese medicine, which is deeply rooted in culture, has gained in popularity through the expansion of insurance program coverage, neither the supply of medical professionals nor the use rates are on a par with its Western medicine counterpart.",

Since NHI was implemented in 1995, there has been further sustained capacity expansion in Taiwan. Table 4\ncompares the health-care establishment for the three economies in Greater China, which shows that Taiwan has more than 15% more beds than Hong Kong in three times as many hospitals per 100 000 population, but providing only about half as many inpatient episodes per capita. Most of Taiwan's health providers operate in the private sector, where 86% of hospitals or 66% of all hospital beds, and 97% of clinics (including some with short-stay beds) are privately owned (Chang, 2001, Department of Health, 2005, Cheng, 2003). Therefore, there has been increasingly fierce competition for and inducement of patient demand. Recent research has shown that competition, mostly through non-price strategies, has intensified since 1995, particularly in the high-margin, competitive market of inpatient care. For instance, many hospitals are quick to adopt and exploit new medical technology to compete for patients (Lu and Hsieh, 2003). By comparison, Taiwan and Hong Kong have similarly high (benchmarked against Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries) levels of outpatient utilization, distributed more or less similarly across Western allopathic, Chinese medicine, and emergency care and generated by about the same number of Western allopathic doctors per capita, although the population-standardized ratio of Chinese medicine providers registered in Taiwan is approximately one-sixth of Hong Kong's (Table 4). However, like the deep urban\u2013rural divide in China and indeed in many Western countries with expansive land mass and uneven population densities, Taiwan's overcapacity varies unevenly by geography and between specialties (as physicians trade off risk, workload, lifestyle, and reward) (Cheng, 2003).",

But it also reflects the heavy concentration of supply-side subsidies in urban hospitals (Ministry of Health, 2004).

Health-care costs have risen rapidly in recent years. One study found that 20% of expenditures associated with the treatment of appendicitis and pneumonia were clinically unnecessary (Liu and Mills, 1999). China has one of the highest shares of pharmaceutical expenditures in total health expenditure in the world\u201446.2% in 2003, compared to an average of around 15% in the OECD, 8.4% in Hong Kong, and 22.8% in Taiwan (Table 1). One study of village clinics found that only 0.06% of drug prescriptions were reasonable (Zhang et al., 2003). In an attempt to curb overuse of services among the urban insured, China introduced demand-side cost-sharing by getting patients to pay a sizeable fraction of the cost of care out of their own pocket, through a complex system of medical savings accounts (MSAs). These may have done more harm than good: their effects on use appear to have been limited (Yip and Hsiao, 1997), but they do seem likely to have caused financial hardship by limiting the amount the scheme will reimburse. More successful, it seems, has been the introduction in a limited number of localities of supply-side cost-sharing: paying providers a pre-agreed sum per case depending on the diagnosis, rather than letting providers simply bill the insurer for whatever tests and care they decide to provide (Cai et al., 1999, Liu et al., 2002, Yip et al., 2004). The relative success of supply-side cost-sharing reflects the fact that it addresses some of the perverse incentives caused by China's official price schedule (Liu et al., 1999, Liu et al., 2000).",

Technology diffusion, the main cost driver in any modern health system, also accelerated post-NHI where there was, for example, a pronounced increase in the use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Lu and Hsieh, 2003). Notwithstanding this higher utilization (be it the effect of moral hazard or enhanced accessibility due to NHI), the total increase in national health spending between 1995 and 2000, after controlling for exogenous spending growth drivers, was not more than the amount that Taiwan would have spent without the program. Such cost containment on the macro level was attributable to the single-payer feature of NHI (Lu and Hsiao, 2003).",

One option would be to reduce the emphasis on programs that disproportionately benefit the better off, such as government support to urban insurance and supply-side subsidies to hospitals, and to increase the share of spending going to pro-poor programs, such as central government spending on the NCMS. Another option is to keep the spending mix the same but reduce the degree to which pro-rich spending items benefit the better off, and increase the degree to which pro-poor items benefit the poor. Through changes to the contribution schedules, some existing government expenditure on urban health insurance could be redirected to making insurance more affordable for the poor. Supply-side subsidies could be targeted increasingly to lower-level facilities used by China's rural poor rather than to city hospitals.

The key challenge with both instruments is to minimize moral hazard. For MSAs in particular, there are also the attendant dangers of cost escalation, which plagued the Singaporean Medisave (Hsiao, 1995) reform, if the funds can be used contemporaneously, or inter-temporal economic deadweight loss if the funds can only be expended in old age as government seems to have suggested (Health Welfare and Food Bureau, 2004).",

Notwithstanding its narrow tax base and low contribution rates, which essentially funds almost all inpatient and some outpatient care, Hong Kong only spends 5.0% of GDP on health overall. Although there is little sensible reason to preset an arbitrary level of health expenditure, and officials are loathe to tinker with the territory's low-tax regime, there should be a reexamination of the relative distribution of the tax dollar among different policy areas such as health, education, and housing.",

NHI's revenue base has not kept pace with GDP growth because contributions are capped at the upper end of income (where the top earning base is only 5.5 times that of the lowest earning base). Meanwhile, health-care costs have grown and will continue to increase more quickly than national income (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2006). Therefore, the contribution rate was raised from 4.25 to 4.55% in 2002 amid a major political storm. Facing a nearly depleted reserve in 2005, NHI quickly promulgated a series of \u2018multi-facet micro-tuning\u2019 programs to expand the revenue base and further contain cost, but it deliberately circumvented further increase in the contribution rate across the board. Specifically, the contribution cap was raised so that the highest earning base became 8.3 times that of the lowest; tobacco tax was doubled; and new budgets were sought to finance high-priority and easily identifiable items such as preventive interventions, infection control, and medical education in the form of teaching cost from relevant government agencies. On cost containment, NHI strengthened primary care gate-keeping by increasing copayments for hospital services without a referral. It also further tightened the claims review process to reduce duplicate testing and fraud. Nonprescription drugs are now no longer reimbursed, and the reimbursement rates for prescription medicine were lowered.",

Although this policy is designed and expected to improve cost containment, it may inadvertently encourage \u2018cream skimming\u2019 by providers.

As regards equity, China faces the biggest challenges, performing worse than both Taiwan and Hong Kong in terms of both inpatient and outpatient utilization and the prevalence of catastrophic health-care expenditures. China has a highly pro-rich distribution of OOP health-care expenditures (i.e. the rich spend more) and OOP spending is less regressive in China than in Taiwan.

Like many tax-financed health systems, Hong Kong has successfully mitigated moral hazard problems through a combination of modest demand-side cost sharing and effective control of provider incentives through public ownership. In recent years, corporatization of the hospital sector and other supply-side reforms have sought to balance the need to control supplier-induced demand, on the one hand, and incentives for efficiency, on the other. Insofar as moral hazard has been a problem in Hong Kong, it has largely been limited to drug prescriptions in ambulatory care. In contrast, provision of unnecessary care and drugs is a well-documented problem in both China and Taiwan. Taiwan has made important strides in addressing this problem, primarily through the introduction of new forms of provider payment and efforts to separate drug prescription and dispensing functions. The recognition of moral hazard has been growing in China in recent years. Measures to date have included a mix of demand- and supply-side measures, with supply-side cost-sharing apparently being the more effective and popular approach.",
