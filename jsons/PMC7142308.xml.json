It can become about 15 cm high, but the size varies a lot depending on the growth habitats. The leaves grow in rosettes, and they are ovate to elliptical with parallel venation (5\u20139). The leaves are glabrous and have an entire or irregularly dentate margin. The flowers are small, brownish-green on long non-ramified spikes.",

The seeds are quite small with an ovate shape (0.4\u20130.8\u00d70.8\u20131.5 mm) and a slightly bitter taste. The seed endosperm has highly thickened cellulosic walls with the cell lumen filled with oil and protein. It forms the major part of the seeds and surrounds the embryo completely. The seeds are located in capsules (8\u201316 per capsule) and become sticky in humid weather due to the swelling of the polysaccharides present in the seed coat (Qadry, 1963). In this manner the seeds can become attached to animals and humans and thereby be spread.",

Henrik Harpestreng (\u2020 1244) from Denmark wrote in \u2018Liber Harbarum\u2019 that P. major could heal everything that was torn apart. Mixed with honey it was recommended on wounds. Boiled with butter and eaten, it could heal any organ in the human body (Nielsen, 1969).",

At that time it was so common in use that even small children knew about it. The nerves were pulled out of the leaves, and then the leaves were applied on the wounds morning and evening. For superficial wounds to heal, it was sufficient to apply the juice from the plant (Br\u00f8ndegaard, 1987). The English apothecary Nicholas Culpeper published \u2018The Complete Herbal\u2019 in 1649. The use of plants in the treatment of diseases was based on astrology. At that time people lacked other explanations as to why some plants had certain effects and others not. According to this theory P. major is under Venus: \u2018It cures the head by its antipathy to Mars and the privities by its sympathy to Venus. There is not a martial disease that it does not cure\u2019. About the medicinal effects he wrote: \u2018It is good to stay spitting of blood and bleedings at the mouth, or the making of foul and bloody water, by reason of any ulcer in the reins or bladder\u2019 (Potterton, 1983).",

PMII contains both smooth polygalacturonan and two different ramified regions; one (PVa) that has relatively high amounts of (1\u21924)- and (1\u21923,6)- linked galactose residues with arabinose linked to position 6. The side chains in PVa were linked to position 4 of the rhamnose residues in the backbone. The other ramified region (PVb) contained arabinose side chains attached to position 3 of the galacturonic acid residues in the backbone. PMII had high anti-complementary activity, and PVa was the part of PMII that had the highest activity. PMII also activated human monocytes in vitro for increased production of tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). The pectin fraction that was isolated from the 100\u00b0C water extract had very low anti-complementary activity compared to PMII, and this may be due to less of the side chains that were in PVa (Samuelsen et al., 1995, Samuelsen et al., 1996). Lately it was shown that PMII activates complement mainly via the classical pathway (Michaelsen et al., 1999) and that it has prophylactic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice (Hetland et al., 1999). From the 50\u00b0C water extract an anti-complementary acidic arabinogalactan, PMIa, was isolated (Samuelsen et al., 1998). It was composed of arabinose (31%), galactose (32%), rhamnose (6%) and galacturonic acid (7%). This arabinogalactan consists of a (1\u21923)- linked galactan backbone with (1\u21926)- linked galactan side chains with arabinose residues attached to position 3 of galactose residues in the side chains. It also contains 1.5% protein with relatively high amounts of hydroxy proline (28.7%), alanine (14.9%) and serine (10.9%) indicating that this is an arabinogalactan type II due to the classification made by Aspinall (1973). The neutral fraction of the water extract had very low anti-complementary activity and consisted of high amounts of glucose and mannose (Samuelsen et al., 1995).",

Acteoside inhibits aldose reductase (Ravn et al., 1990) and 5-HETE formation (Kimura et al., 1987). It has antibacterial (Shoyama et al., 1987), immunesuppressant (Sasaki et al., 1989) and analgesic activity (Andary et al., 1982). Acteoside has antihypertensive effect, at a dose of 10 mg/kg on rats a significant decrease in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure was observed (Ahmad et al., 1995). The biological activities of these and other caffeic acid derivatives are reviewed in Jim\u00e9nez and Riguera (1994).",

            "text": "Many flavonoids are antioxidants (Rice-Evans et al., 1996, Bohm et al., 1998). Examples of such compounds in P. major are baicalein, hispidulin and plantaginin (Yuting et al., 1990, Yokozawa et al., 1997, Skari et al., 1999b). A number of flavonoids are also known to have free radical scavenging activity (Kandaswami and Middleton, 1994). Baicalein, hispidulin, scutallarein and plantaginin are free radical scavengers and inhibit lipid peroxidation (Sanz et al., 1994, Yoshino et al., 1997, Gao et al., 1999, Skari et al., 1999b). Both baicalein and hispidulin have anti-inflammatory activities. Baicalein inhibits carrageenan-induced rat paw edema (Lin and Shieh, 1996a), 12-lipoxygenase (You et al., 1999) and LPS induced production of nitric oxide in macrophages (Wakabayashi, 1999) while hispidulin has been shown to be an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (Moongkarndi et al., 1991). Baicalein has hepatoprotective effect against CCl4-induced liver injuries in rats (Lin and Shieh, 1996b). Baicalein can induce cell death of carcinoma cells (Matsuzaki et al., 1996), cause inhibition of cell growth of human hepatoma cells (Motoo and Sawabu, 1994) and has shown strong antiproliferative effect in rat hepatic stellate cells (Inoue and Jackson, 1999). Scutallarein and baicalein have antiallergic activities (Kawasaki et al., 1994, Toyoda et al., 1997). In addition, they are HIV-reverse transcriptase inhibitors in vitro; (IC50 2.5 and 5.6 \u03bcM, respectively). The glucosides plantaginin, luteolin 7-glucoside and homoplantaginin are also potent inhibitors (IC50 9.8, 40.2 and 43.3 \u03bcM, respectively) while apigenin 7-glucoside had no inhibitory effect on HIV-reverse transcriptase (Nishibe et al., 1997).",

The leaves were extracted with phosphate buffer pH 7 containing 0.9% NaCl and injected subcutaneously in mice of the C3H Strong strain. Among mice of this strain more than 90% develop cancer induced by a virus infection. After 60 weeks, 93.3% of the untreated and 18.2% of the treated mice had tumours. The observed effect is thought to be due to stimulation of the immune system rather than a direct effect on the virus. No experimental results support this idea, only some observations made without experimental verification. The P. major extract had good effect on human herpes infections but had no effect on the herpes virus in in vitro tests. The same observations have been made for bacteria; only weak antibacterial activity of P. major extracts in vitro, but they had an effect on infected wounds in vivo.
