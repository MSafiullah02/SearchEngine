            "text": "There are several factors (or determinants) that contribute to the health of a person or a population. According to McGinnis, these factors are divided into five categories 1 : Biology, Behavior, Social, Environment and Medical care. Of these, biology and behavior have the largest contribution to the health of an individual, followed by social, medical care and environment. Figure 2 -1 shows the relationship among these determinants. 1. Biology: the age and sex of the person; the genetic makeup including heritable diseases. At the current time, biological factors are the hardest to change, although many are hopeful that genetic engineering may change this at some point. For this reason, most public-sector investment in public health aims to affect the behavioral, social, environmental and medical access determinants. 2. Behaviors: alcohol, tobacco, substance abuse; risk-prone lifestyles, such as working as a miner or prostitute. 3. Social: discrimination, income disparities, socioeconomic status, education, occupation, class, social support. Poorer people often lack time and opportunity to exercise. Food for a healthier diet tends to be more expensive and takes longer to prepare. A strong and consistent finding of epidemiological research is that there are health differences among socioeconomic groups. Lower mortality, morbidity, and disability rates among socioeconomically advantaged people have been observed for hundreds of years. 4. Environment (or total ecology): where a person lives, sanitary and crowding conditions, air and water quality, lead exposure, and the design of neighborhoods. Some of the most dramatic improvements in population health during the twentieth century include: improved water, food, and milk sanitation, reduced physical crowding, improved nutrition, and central heating with cleaner fuels. Most Americans live in urban areas, which are often associated with harmful health behaviors, such as lack of exercise, poor diet, sexual behavior, alcohol and substance abuse. 2 Cities also have higher levels of air pollution, which may cause cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Crowded buildings may increase the risk of lead exposure as well as asthma. Those that live in rural areas have other risks, such as exposure to pesticides. 5. Medical care: access to quality health care; having insurance. For example, the availability of Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) was expanded greatly with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. This resulted in greater access to medical care for a previously underserved population. Similarly, the nationwide shift to high-deductible insurance plans has actually reduced accessibility to affordable healthcare for many.",

            "text": "None of these determinants functions in a vacuum. They are intertwined and often interdependent. Ameliorating issues in one of the determinants may exacerbate issues in another. For example, a Health Impact Assessment by the World Health Organization studied the effects of transportation on public health. As with any intervention, there are both risks and benefits. 3 1. More vehicles on the road increases the risk of motor vehicle accidents (especially at extremes of age). 2. Air pollution results in climate change and increased incidence of respiratory disease. 3 . Noise pollution may cause disrupted sleep cycles. 4 . Building highways or train tracks may separate communities or decrease the amount of arable land. 5. Increased transportation allows for better access to employment and economic development, possibly resulting in better infrastructure and better access to medical care. 6. Cycling or walking may improve physical activity. Driving or taking a train may reduce physical activity. 7. Better transportation allows for wider dispersal of vector borne diseases (e.g. SARS, Ebola). Place-Based Approaches Some argue that the natural and built environment in which a person lives may be more predictive of future health than his genetic make up. 4 Therefore, solutions which target specific social or community problems are more likely to succeed. For example, the Colorado Health Foundation sought to fight obesity by building parks and playgrounds with walking trails. In Camden, NJ, public health officials noted an extraordinarily high rate of patients going to the Emergency Department (ED) for issues that could be handled by primary care doctors. In response, they set up a referral program which set up high-utilizing patients with clinics, thereby reducing unnecessary ED visits. Most individual health efforts involve clinical interventions with high-risk groups (such as treating patients with hypertension). However, these measures do very little to prevent a population from getting sick in the first place. Recognizing the spectrum of risk and applying interventions more broadly may be more efficacious. 5 1. All risk exists on a spectrum. Risk factors for certain diseases have traditionally been recorded as either present or not present (i.e. either the patient has a history of diabetes or he doesn't). However, a more accurate way of recording risk is through continuous instead of dichotomous variables. For example, there is no convenient level of zero risk for conditions such as blood pressure, cholesterol, alcohol consumption, tobacco consumption, physical activity, weight or lead exposure. 2. Only a small percentage of the population is at the extremes of risk. Exposure of a large number of people to a small risk results in more burden of illness than exposure of a small number of people to high risk. Therefore, the most effective interventions will be aimed at the moderate risk categories, even though they are not themselves sick. 3. An individual's risk can only be interpreted in the context of his population. For example, the risk of a person in the United States of dying from an acute myocardial infarction is higher than a person in Japan, possibly because the incidence of hyperlipidemia is higher in the US than Japan. People planning population based health interventions should first ask why the population in Japan has lower cholesterol and only then try to figure out ways to lower cholesterol in the US.",

On television, he sees an ad for over-the-counter (OTC) omeprazole (manufactured by Procter and Gamble) as well as an ad for prescription-only pantoprazole (Pfizer). The FDA was responsible for approving both of these medications for sale in the US. The FDA also regulates ads for prescription medications, while the Federal Trade Commission regulates nonprescription ads. The patient is unsure which medication is better for him, so he makes an appointment with his provider. The provider (who holds a state license to practice medicine) reviews several published studies on proton pump inhibitors and suggests omeprazole as it is noninferior to and less expensive than pantoprazole. When the patient goes to the local pharmacy (which is licensed by the state as well as the federal Drug Enforcement Agency), he compares prices for the available drugs. His insurance plan does not cover OTC drugs, but it will cover part of the cost of prescription drugs with a co-payment. The state Department of Banking and Insurance has mandated that there must be more than one drug in each therapeutic class placed in the lowest tier of co-pays, which means that the co-pay for pantoprazole is actually lower than the retail cost of omeprazole.",

            "text": "In healthcare, data flows in many directions, often at the same time. As an example, medical research produces medical literature which informs clinical guidelines which are incorporated into an Electronic Health Record (EHR) which is used for patient care. Patient information and demographics are collected by registrars who also enter this information into the EHR. Physicians use a clinical decision support system to place orders for laboratory, radiology and pharmacy. Each of these departments performs tests or therapies. When the tests have been resulted, the information is returned to the EHR to further guide patient care. When care is complete, the data is sent to billing and collections. This often requires twoway communication with insurers and other payors to provide justification and explanation of services. The EHR is also used for chart reviews within the institution for quality assurance, performance improvement and utilization review. Patient data is also sent to the regional health information exchange, where it will be used to guide care if this patient is seen at another institution. In addition, the data may be used for secondary analysis for epidemiological studies by researchers who then contribute to the medical literature and so on (Figure 2-3) . Some dataflows are unidirectional while others involve two-way communication. When a department director conducts a performance improvement (PI) project, she reviews data from the EHR regarding care given to particular patients. Since the data only flows from the EHR to the PI activity, it is unidirectional. However, when a doctor orders a laboratory test, the laboratory receives the order from the EHR, completes the order and then sends results back to the EHR, resulting in bidirectional dataflow.",

This was calculated by determining the average cost for similar services in the region where the service was provided. In many cases the reimbursement for particular services was negotiated beforehand. Depending on the supply and demand for services, either the insurer or provider has an upper hand in constructing the pay scale. When a person pays for healthcare directly, there is frequently much more room for negotiation. This arrangement encouraged patients to seek care more frequently and encouraged physicians to increase the intensity and diversity of services provided. This was the heyday of the fee-for-service system. Doctors and hospitals continued to provide increasingly expensive treatments which were paid in full by insurers. Hospitals were paid a daily rate for inpatients, and therefore tended to keep their patients as long as possible. 11 As the cost of being sick skyrocketed, it became financially impossible for persons without insurance to pay for their care. As a result, profitable hospitals would routinely refuse to accept uninsured patients.",

Co-insurance requires the patient to pay a fixed fraction (usually 10-40%) of the cost of care. Since hospital admissions can easily run into $100,000 or more, this becomes a significant financial burden for the majority of healthcare consumers.

One of the common managed care strategies involved shifting the financial risk from the insurer to the providers. One example is capitation, where a primary care doctor was given a certain amount of money per patient per year. If the patient required hospitalization or an expensive procedure, it came out of the doctor's share. Similarly, if the patient remained healthy, the doctor profited.
