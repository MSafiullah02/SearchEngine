Most of these studies have been done in mice. Some have been performed in rats. Mice are different from other species in that they can have one or two renin genes (Ren-1 and Ren-2), depending on the strain (29). Ren-2 may have arisen from gene duplication during evolution. Thus, C57/BL6 mice express one renin gene while 129 sv mice express two renin genes. Interestingly, the adenosine receptor gene knockout mice, regardless of the strain (30), always express both renin genes. The physiological significance of one versus two genes is unknown thus far: there is no significant difference in plasma renin levels or renal renin mRNA expression between the two.",

In hypertensive mice expressing human renin (hREN) and human angiotensinogen transgenes under the control of their own endogenous promoters, glial-specific deletion of angiotensinogen results in lowered blood pressure (35), indicating that the central nervous system also contributes to the regulation of blood pressure. Introduction of the mouse Ren-2 gene into normotensive rats creates a transgenic strain that expresses Ren-2 mRNA in the adrenal gland, and the kidney (36). This transgene provides a monogenic model for a form of sodium dependent malignant hypertension. The Ren-2 transgenic rat has hyperproreninemia, low plasma and renal renin, high adrenal renin, and increased adrenal corticosteroid production. The hypertension that occurs in this model is responsive to ACE inhibitors. ACE deficient mice have decreased blood pressure and renal disease characterized by perivascular infiltrates and impaired concentration ability, indicating a role of ACE in the development of nephron function (37). ACE2 deficient mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy, and have a hypertensive response to Ang II (38,39).",

In primates, in the immediate neonatal period, autoregulation of renal blood flow is present, but autoregulation of blood flow to other organs, such as brain, myocardium, and intestines, is not observed (101). Autoregulation of renal blood flow is observed in canine puppies as young as 14 days of age (102).

TGF and GTB may be more critical in the regulation of renal function in the neonate than in the adult as sodium intake is low in the newborn; sodium balance must be tightly regulated to achieve the net positive balance required for growth.

ACE inhibitor-induced fetopathy, consisting of oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, hypocalvaria, renal dysplasia, anuria, and death, has been described in mothers exposed to ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (110). These effects were initially believed to arise from a decrease in organ perfusion (111). More recent evidence indicates that ACE inhibition has teratogenic effects during development. Fetuses exposed to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester have an increased risk of congenital malformations, with an incidence of 7.1%, compared to those with no maternal exposure to antihypertensive medications during the same time period. The congenital anomalies are major and include cardiovascular defects such as atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defects and pulmonic stenosis; skeletal malformations, including polydactyly, upper limb defects and craniofacial anomalies; gastrointestinal malformations such as pyloric stenosis and intestinal atresia; central nervous system malformations such as hydrocephalus, spina bifida and microcephaly; and genitourinary malformations including renal malformations (112). Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have also been reported to be fetotoxic (113). Inhibition of the activity of the RAAS in pregnancy may have effects on the fetus that manifest later on in life, such as hypertension, which are addressed later.",

Angiotensinogen is expressed in the proximal part of the primitive tubule in the mouse at embryonic day 12.5 (30 days\u2019 gestation in humans) (115). Renin is widely expressed initially in the renal vasculature in the embryonic rat, but its expression becomes localized to the afferent arteriole with development. Renin secretion is greater during the early embryonic period and decreases gradually. Circulating renin levels are higher in the neonatal rodent than in the adult, and appear to be due to increased production (115). Rodent ACE follows a similar expression pattern as in humans. Ang II and AT1 receptors are important in nephron development and afferent arterial growth. AT1 receptors may guide Ang II to its target sites to induce cell growth and differentiation (116, 117, 118). AT1 receptor mRNA is strongly expressed during the early embryonic period (E17 to E20 in the rat), with increased expression in mature nephron segments by E17, persisting until adulthood (119). AT2 expression is seen in both the undifferentiated mesenchyme in the maturing kidney and the mature nephron, including the proximal tubule. Collectrin, a novel homolog of ACE2 (120) shares about 47% homology with ACE2 in humans, but lacks the carboxypeptidase function. Collectrin mRNA is expressed in the mouse embryo at day 13, is localized to the ureteric bud, the progenitor of the collecting duct, increases throughout development, and decreases after birth.",

AT2 receptor deficient mice have congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), such as multicystic dysplastic, and aplastic kidneys (124). The more dramatic phenotypes seen in mice with deficient AT2 receptor, as compared to humans with similar defects, is attributed to the fact that human nephrogenesis is completed in utero, while maturation of rodent nephrons occurs for up to 10 days after birth. However, AT1 receptor gene deficient phenotypes are similar in rodents and humans. As indicated earlier, mutations in angiotensin-related genes in humans are associated with renal tubular dysgenesis (123).

However, a positive balance of sodium in the neonate is needed to sustain growth, in contrast to normal adults who are in sodium balance. The kidney of a full term infant filters 4\u20135% of the volume of plasma filtered by an adult (120 mL/min/1.73M2). Despite the relative paucity of sodium transporters, the full-term neonate does retain sodium, in part because of the low GFR (3). Although renal sodium transporters are reduced, neonates cannot excrete a sodium load compared to adults. This has been attributed to the increased activity of agents that increase sodium reabsorption in the neonatal period, including the RAAS and \u03b1-adrenergic receptors (117,138). Endogenous Ang II inhibits the natriuresis of acute expansion in the neonatal rat (139). The decreased effects of natriuretic factors (e.g., atrial natriuretic peptide, dopamine, nitric oxide) in the term neonate compared to the adult may also impair its ability to excrete a sodium load (140, 141, 142). Water transport across the proximal tubule also differs in adults and neonates. The adult tubule transports water by the water channels called aquaporins, which belong to the category of non-solute carrier-related genes. These are present in very low concentrations in the neonatal nephron. However, water is transported effectively in the neonatal nephron by paracellular and transmembrane mechanisms and by passage through non-aquaporin channels to maintain GTB (see below) (143). Aquaporin expression increased with age, an effect that is mediated by glucocorticoids (144).",

The renal sodium loss in prematurity appears, in part, to result from the immaturity of the TGF mechanism. Postnatal age has been shown to have an independent effect on FENa but not on GFR. These findings indicate that in infants of greater than 33 weeks\u2019 gestation, sodium conservation is possible because of adequate TGF. The rapid increase in sodium reabsorption in the first few postnatal days seems to be due to maturation of distal tubular function. Although this was initially attributed to aldosterone (147), the decreased amount of transporters that are targets of aldosterone makes this mechanism unlikely. An increase in maturity of the Na+K+ATPase in the distal tubule and a decrease in extracellular fluid volume may be contributory factors to postnatal maturation of sodium transport in the distal tubule.",

            "text": "The essential regulatory mechanisms of tubule transport include GTB and neural and hormonal factors such as sympathetic innervation, Ang II, endothelin, parathormone, and other mediators. As defined earlier, GTB is the capacity of each segment of the nephron to reabsorb a constant fraction of the GFR, fluid and solute delivered to it, and is influenced by peritubular and intratubular capillary pressures and GFR (148). The capacity of the proximal tubule to reabsorb sodium, chloride and water, bicarbonate, glucose and organic substances is adjusted to GFR: the higher the GFR, the greater the reabsorption. The underlying physical mechanism of GTB is a flow-dependent reabsorption of ions and water across the renal proximal tubular luminal membrane in response to changes in GFR, which is independent of neural and hormonal systems. Maintenance of GTB is influenced by flow rate, substrate delivery and other unknown systems. It is signaled by the hydrodynamic torque (bending movement) on epithelial microvilli (149). Increases in luminal diameter have the effect of blunting the impact of flow velocity on microvillous shear stress and, thus, on microvillous torque. Variations in microvillous torque produce nearly identical fractional changes in sodium reabsorption. Furthermore, the flow-dependent sodium transport is enhanced by increasing luminal fluid viscosity, diminished in NHE3 knockout mice, and abolished by nontoxic disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. These data suggest that the \u2018brush-border\u2019 microvilli serve a mechanosensory function wherein fluid dynamic torque is transmitted to the actin cytoskeleton to modulate sodium absorption in renal proximal tubules.",

The incidence of hyponatremia was associated with a negative sodium balance, which varied directly with the degree of prematurity. Indeed, no babies born after 36 weeks had a negative sodium balance.

Thus, a lack of adenosine abrogates the change in GFR engendered by TGF, but does not affect distal reabsorption of sodium and water along the tubule, likely mediated by aldosterone (165). The cells of the macula densa display a role in regulation, by sensing increased NaCl delivery to the distal tubule, and activation of Na+K+2Cl cotransporter activity to reduce GFR, with adenosine most likely being the mediator of this response. Indeed, TGF is absent in A1 receptor knockout, mice (165). In anesthetized wild type, and A1 receptor knockout mice, GFR and renal blood flow were measured before and after reducing renal perfusion pressure by a suprarenal aortic clamp. A reduction in blood pressure produced a significantly greater fall in A1 receptor knockout mice compared to the wild type, indicating reduced regulatory responses in the knockout mice. This suggests that deficient autoregulation in the absence of the effector adenosine or A1 receptor is mediated by abrogation of the TGF response.",

The diuresis and natriuresis are associated with a reduction in absolute proximal tubular reabsorption and its uncoupling from glomerular filtration. In addition, the response of the macula densa to increased distal delivery of sodium chloride and water is blunted, as there is no corresponding decrease in GFR. This indicates inhibition of the TGF mechanisms, and provides additional support for adenosine being the mediator of the TGF response. The lack of proximal tubular regulation in GTB could be indicative of adenosine being a player in GTB, in addition to the known and accepted peritubular, luminal and oncotic controls that regulate it. However, the mechanism underlying the increased formation of adenosine in response to an increase in Na+K+2Cl cotransporter activity remains to be determined.",

Other NOS isoforms may be expressed in the mesangium and glomerular microvessels. These enzymes are strategically positioned to influence each step of the TGF process (170). However, micropuncture experiments using NOS antagonists have shown that NO does not mediate TGF. Instead, local NOS blockade causes the curve that represents TGF to shift leftward and become steeper. Changes in NO production in the macula densa may underlie the resetting of TGF, which is needed to maintain the TGF curve so that it adapts to different conditions of ambient tubular flow to accommodate physiologic circumstances and maintain homeostasis (171). Also, macula densa NO production may be substrate limited and dissociated from NOS protein content. The importance of NO to TGF resetting and the substrate dependence of NO production have both been found during changes in dietary salt. Changes in neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOS1) function have been shown to occur in the JGA of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) (172). NOS inhibition has been demonstrated to have a reduced effect on TGF in the SHR (173).",

While the superoxide anion may lead to vasoconstriction and an increase in myogenic tone, directly, and via many signaling pathways, it also influences vasoconstriction and vasodilatation as a consequence of TGF. These effects occur due to changes in macula densa cell function in response to changes in sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule. The macula densa expresses nNOS (171), which is activated during sodium chloride reabsorption and has a vasodilatory effect; this blunts the vasoconstriction caused by the TGF in response to increased sodium chloride transport. Oxygen radicals enhance the TGF response and limit NO signaling from the macula densa (174). Reactive oxygen species react with NO, producing peroxynitrate, which impairs vasorelaxation and promotes hypertrophy (175, 176, 177): thus reactive oxygen species effectively counteract the effects of NO.",

The infusion of a nitric oxide precursor into the macula densa caused a graded reduction in the TGF-mediated afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction; this response was more pronounced in the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat compared to the (SHR) (171). The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle also produces NO, as it expresses endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS III) (170,173). Here, studies have shown that NO decreases net absorption of chloride and bicarbonate in the isolated thick ascending limb (178), thus indirectly decreasing the TGF response by increasing delivery of these to the distal tubule. Superoxide anion activates 5\u2032-nucleotidase, thereby increasing adenosine generation in the kidney (which we know to be a mediator of TGF).

A reduction in nephron number during development may contribute to a reduction in GFR, but this is not always borne out in experimental studies. Multiple factors may contribute to the development of hypertension, but we will restrict ourselves to the role of renal hemodynamics. The RAAS may play a more important role as it is expressed early and associated with nephrogenesis. Blockade of the AT1 receptor during the nephrogenic period after birth in the rat led to a decrease in nephron number, a reduction in renal function and hypertension (182). Protein restricted diets have also shown a rise in ACE levels in pregnant ewes (183) and a general stimulation of all components of the systemic RAS in other studies in response to protein restriction, which is blocked by treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an AT1 receptor blocker. Thus, the adverse environment in utero, which programs the fetus to develop hypertension could be critically linked to abnormalities in the RAS (182).",

The integrity of the RAAS is essential for normal development, and Ang II is essential for normal structural development of the kidney and collecting system. The complex interplay of GTB and TGF increases with gestational age. The excretory function of the kidney begins soon after clamping of the umbilical cord at birth and continues through the first year of life. It follows that the neonate is exquisitely sensitive to stressors, which activate the RAAS, and lead to profound oligoanuric states.",

However, decreased cotransporter activity impairs the TGF and, in the face of continued ion and water excretion, may result in hypovolemia, activation of the RAS and may lead to anuria. Indomethacin, used to treat patent ductus arteriosus in the neonate, could lead to altered renal vasoregulation (191). Congenital abnormalities in steroid synthesis could lead to deficiencies in aldosterone production, and cause profound salt-wasting states (192). In pseudohypoaldosteronism Type 1, mutations in the sodium channel may cause profound neonatal salt wasting (193). To counter the heightened awareness of the RAAS in neonates, adenosine receptor antagonists may offer new avenues of therapy.",

Together with the myogenic response, the RAAS serves to maintain volume homeostasis in sodium and volume depleted states, and renoprotection in hypertensive states. The relative contributions of these two systems continue to be an area of controversy and debate. We also know that central and peripheral sympathetic input influences all aspects of renal autoregulation. More studies in transplanted or denervated kidneys in animal models and humans will elucidate these areas of controversy. A better understanding of these mechanisms would translate to better care for premature and full term newborns with renal dysregulation, hyponatremia and oligoanuric renal failure.",
