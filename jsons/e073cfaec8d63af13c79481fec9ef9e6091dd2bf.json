We conducted a thorough review of the scientific literature on neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, the neuroinvasive propensity of known coronaviruses (CoV) and their possible effects on brain structural and functional integrity. It appears that around one third of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for respiratory difficulties exhibit neurologic symptoms. This may be due to progressive brain damage and dysfunction triggered by severe hypoxia and hypoxemia, heightened inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 dissemination into brain parenchyma, as suggested by current reports and analyses of previous CoV outbreaks. Viral invasion of the brain may particularly target and alter brainstem and thalamic functions and, consequently, result in sensorimotor dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, data collected from other structurally homologous CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to brain cell degeneration and demyelination similar to multiple sclerosis (MS). Hence, current evidence warrants further evaluation and long-term follow-up of possible neurologic sequelae in COVID-19 patients. It may be particularly relevant to evaluate brainstem integrity in recovered patients, as it is suspected that this cerebral area may particularly be dysfunctional following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because CoV infection can potentially lead to chronic neuroinflammation and progressive demyelination, neuroimaging features and signs of MS may also be evaluated in the long term in recovered COVID-19 patients. p3 -OGIER p27 -OGIER Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.",

Some of the p5 -OGIER symptoms reported, especially headache, dizziness and loss of consciousness, are not specific, as they could possibly be due to the severe hypoxia associated with respiratory failure. Other symptoms could result from the dysimmune state caused by the infection, in particular from the abnormally high inflammation that is referred to as \"cytokine storm\". For instance, cytokine storm may be involved in acute neurovascular pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients without pre-existing vascular risk factors (Talan, 2020) . Moreover, the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients may be facilitated by SARS-CoV-2 interaction with its cellular receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) . Indeed, dysfunction of ACE2 due to its interaction with the virus may lead to hypertension. This hypothesis is corroborated by a recent study that demonstrated that anticoagulant treatment can improve survival of COVID-19 patients (Tang et al., 2020) . Olfactory dysfunction, i.e. anosmia, has been reported in up to 85.6% of mildto-moderate COVID-19 patients (Lechien et al., 2020) . Anosmia may be a sign of olfactory bulb viral infection, which could represent the first step through which SARS-CoV-2 invades the brain, through olfactory neurons, as this dissemination route has already been described in preclinical studies of SARS-CoV-1 (Netland et al., 2008) .",

Animal studies have shown that two HCoV, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-1, can penetrate the CNS via the olfactory nerves (Desforges et al., 2019) . A path from the olfactory bulb to the brainstem through the piriform cortex has been demonstrated in transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 and intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-1 (Netland et al., 2008) . Similarly, HCoV-OC43 can infect the olfactory bulb of mice after nasal inoculation and can spread into the brain via transneuronal transport up to the spinal cord (St-Jean et al., 2004; Desforges et al., 2019) . HCoV-OC43 disseminates to the whole brain in less than 7 days and can be detected in neurons as well as glial cells (St-Jean et al., 2004) . Other neuronal routes have been described: for instance, the influenza A virus can reach brainstem respiratory centers from the lungs via the vagus nerve (Matsuda et al., 2004) .",

It is suspected that SARS-CoV-1 can take advantage of the permeabilization of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) caused by excessive amounts of cytokines and chemokines released after viral infection of the airways (McCray et al., 2007) . MERS-CoV could also use the leukocytes as \"Trojan horses\" to penetrate the CNS. Indeed, activated leukocytes express the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is a functional receptor of MERS-CoV (Zhao et al., 2015) . The hypothesis that MERS-CoV may use the hematogenous route to reach the brain is supported by the fact that some neurologic symptoms (seizure, encephalitis, stroke) are reported to emerge 2 to 3 weeks after ARDS (Kim et al., 2017) . Nevertheless, in the first days following p7 -OGIER infection, the hypothesis of hematogenous route is debated. SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV are not detected within the brain in non-neuronal cells, suggesting a more direct pathway to reach the brain . In addition, in a mouse model of hepatitis virus infection, viral antigens were still not detected in blood cells 3 days after intranasal inoculation while they were already present in olfactory bulbs (St-Jean et al., 2004) .",

It has also been detected in several peripheral tissues, including the nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph node, thymus, bone marrow, spleen and liver (Hamming et al., 2004) . In addition, ACE2-mRNA and protein have been detected in several regions of the brain (Harmer et al., 2002; Hamming et al., 2004; Xia and Lazartigues, 2008) . The typology of ACE2-expressing brain cells is still debated (Xia and Lazartigues, 2008) . However, animal studies suggest that the enzyme is predominantly expressed by neurons (Doobay et al., 2007) . Hence, neurons might be directly targeted and infected by SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. contribute to brain damages induced by SARS-CoV-1 (Xu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016b) . Similar exacerbated inflammatory status was also reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and was characterized by elevated blood concentrations of interleukin (IL-)6, 8 and 10 and of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (Chen et al., 2020b (Chen et al., , 2020a . Inflammation was more prominent in severe than in moderate COVID-19 cases, and in deceased victims more than in recovered patients, suggesting that inflammatory processes play a critical role in disease progression and mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chen et al., 2020b (Chen et al., , 2020a . In addition, peripheral lymphopenia was detected in the majority of COVID-19 patients regardless of clinical severity (Chen et al., 2020a) . All patients with impaired inflammatory status exhibited respiratory failure and few of them were diagnosed with hypoxic encephalopathy, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect the CNS (Chen et al., 2020a) .",

Expression of hACE2 makes these mice prone to brain invasion by SARS-CoV-1. Sixty hours after intranasal inoculation, SARS-CoV-1 viral particles are detected in olfactory bulbs (the most infected region) and in deeper brain parts, including the piriform and infralimbic cortices, basal ganglia, dorsal raphe, thalamic nuclei and brainstem (Netland et al., 2008) . Unlike reports in human brain samples, histologic evaluations in these mice showed restricted brain inflammation without change in astrocyte density, but with an increase in the density of microglial cells (Netland et al., 2008) . In addition, significant elevation of IL-6, CCL2, IFN-\u03b3 and CCL12 expression was measured in mice brain 4 days after SARS-CoV-1 infection (McCray et al., 2007) . Hence, these experimental studies corroborate the hypothesis that HCoV infection may lead to brain inflammation. Similar results were obtained in murine models infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Following intranasal inoculation with the JHM (John Howard Muller) strain of MHV, microglial cells are quickly activated, phagocytize infected cells and release several cytokines including IFN-\u03b1/ \u03b2, CCL2, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 (Wheeler et al., 2018) . This suggests that brain immune response to CoV infection is similar regardless of the viral strain and suggest a predominant role of microglia in the initial stage of defense reaction to CoV infection. This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that depletion of microglia exacerbates viral replication and is associated with faster viral spread in the brain of infected mice (Wheeler et al., 2018) . Moreover, it seems that microglia recruitment is required for proper activation of T lymphocytes after infection (Wheeler et al., 2018) .",

Based on their cytolytic activity, CD8+ T cells are likely to play a fundamental role in control and clearance of the virus, while CD4+ T cells may locally enhance the immune response by releasing IFN-\u03b3 and stimulating the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in microglial cells (Wheeler et al., 2018) . These mechanisms are most probably triggered in order to increase viral clearance, since it requires both MHC 1 and 2 expression by immunocompetent cells (Skinner et al., 2019) . Two cytokines seem to be fundamental for initiation of the inflammatory reaction following JHMV infection. A sentinel role for CXCL10 is suggested, as its release attracts T lymphocytes (Skinner et al., 2019) , while IL-21 may optimize both B and T lymphocyte responses in the CNS . In addition, CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are recruited when inflammatory response reaches a peak, and modulate the extend of the immune defense response (de Aquino et al., 2013) . Treg are essential to avoid subsequent damage induced by prolonged neuroinflammation, and their action also limit viral replication, although it does not influence the persistence of the virus in the CNS (de Aquino et al., 2013) . These data suggest that if cerebral inflammation is contained, CoV-induced neuropathologies may be avoided or, at least, alleviated.",

The vast majority of radiologic examination reports published so far have described the same overall pattern of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients, i.e. ground-glass opacities and consolidations, which seem to be temporally linked with the evolution of respiratory symptoms (Shi et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Interestingly, these types of lesions may not necessarily be due to deterioration of the lungs following direct viral infection, as they are also frequently reported in dysphagic patients with chronic aspiration that are particularly susceptible to aspiration pneumonia (Scheeren et al., 2016) . A retrospective study on 113 deceased COVID-19 patients revealed that 44% of them initially presented with p13 -OGIER dyspnea and 72% developed ARDS (Chen et al., 2020b) . ARDS was mainly associated with type 1 respiratory failure, which most probably originated from lung deterioration and was also associated, although to a much lesser extent, to signs of type 2 respiratory failure, which can result from extra-pulmonary deficits, especially from brainstem dysfunction. Hence, SARS-CoV-2-related respiratory failure may be multifactorial and result from dysfunction of multiple organs. (Diamant, 1997; Browning and Travagli, 2014; Benarroch, 2018) . It is likely that the vomiting diseases pertaining to CoV PHEV infection be the consequence of lesions located within these medullary brainstem nuclei and the resulting dysfunction of the digestive tract.",

As an example, the ageusia/dysgeusia that seems to be relatively common in COVID-19 patients (from 5.6% (Mao et al., 2020) to 88% (Lechien et al., 2020) ) may very well be the consequence of the dysfunction of these two brain regions. Indeed, the first central relay of gustatory afferents to the brain is the nucleus of the solitary tract, which integrates gustatory information from nerves V, VII, IX and X, and distributes them to the rest of the brain through secondary medullo-thalamic connections (to the posteromedial ventral nucleus of the thalamus) and tertiary thalamo-cortical connections (Heckmann et al., 2003) . Therefore, any lesion or disconnection in these brainstem and thalamic regions may result in gustatory dysfunction. It is noteworthy that the brainstem and thalamus are not the p16 -OGIER only brain regions where viral invasion has been noted in animal studies. In K18-hACE2 mice, SARS-CoV-1 was also detected in the midbrain, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, cortex and olfactory bulb (Netland et al., 2008) . Therefore, it is possible that these regions may also be dysfunctional following SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection and lead to neurologic symptoms.",

Post-mortem analyses have demonstrated that the presence of CoV (HCoV-OC43) RNA is relatively common in the brain of MS patients compared to controls (36 vs 14%) (Arbour et al., 2000) . Demyelination could be caused by the death of oligodendrocytes, the intense immune response, or the release of inflammatory molecules by infected neural cells. Given the potential neural invasion by SARS-CoV-2, a high incidence of MS among recovered patients might be expected. ABR could be helpful in distinguishing individuals affected by MS after resolution of deadly infectious symptoms. In MS, demyelination induces a heterogeneous slowing of conduction in the auditory pathway resulting in desynchronization. Desynchronization alters ABR by modifying the morphologies of waves III and V, depressing wave V, and lowering to 1 the amplitude ratio between waves V and I. It also disturbs behavioral performance in specific auditory tests (Furst and Levine, 2015) . Since integration of binaural information requires high temporal coding performance, psychoacoustic tests like lateralization tests or binaural masking level difference tests are usually disturbed in MS patients. These behavioral tests are low-cost and could be a good alternative to ABR which need specific devices and expertise. Studies with MS cases documented by MRI have shown that behavioral tests are reliable, although they can be time-consuming (Levine et al., 1994; Furst et al., 1995 Furst et al., , 2000 . Nevertheless, duration for clinical versions of these tests can be shortened (Moore and Sek, 2009; F\u00fcllgrabe and p19 -OGIER Moore, 2017) . It is important to note that these behavioral tests have a major drawback, as they can also be influenced by higher cerebral dysfunction (that would, nonetheless, still indicate brain dysfunction in COVID-19 patients). In recovered COVID-19 patients, a longitudinal supervision would improve the efficacy of the screening by comparing the results of ABR and/or behavioral tests to a baseline or to previous follow-up examinations.",

Improvement of the monitoring protocols of patients with ongoing symptoms and those that were, apparently, successfully treated may be implemented in clinical practice ( Figure 1) .

Indeed, number of animal studies have pointed out that brainstem neurons are targeted by CoV and may subsequently die. This may result in respiratory failure, as brainstem neurons are in charge of the regulation of most vital physiological processes, especially of respiratory and cardiac functions (Nicholls and Paton, 2009). Studies performed in the early 80's in piglets have demonstrated that infection with CoV PHEV, which shares high structural homology with human HCoV-OC43, leads to neurologic symptoms and vomiting diseases associated with encephalomyelitis (Andries and Pensaert, 1980). These studies have demonstrated that after oronasal inoculation, CoV PHEV could be detected in the brain of piglets, especially in the brainstem region (Andries and Pensaert, 1980). The brainstem is rapidly infected by CoV PHEV, which is initially detected in medullary sensory trigeminal and vagal neurons. These neurons are particularly involved in regulation of the digestive tract function, deglutition, as well as the cardiac and respiratory functions",

COVID-19 patients that are either admitted to ICU for severe respiratory failure or exhibit neurologic symptoms at initial diagnosis may be considered as having more risks for developing chronic neuroinflammation and brain p32 -OGIER cell degeneration due to infection. This may also be true for confirmed patients suffering from pre-existing conditions associated with chronic neuroinflammation. Patients exhibiting these characteristics should be submitted to a long-term neurologic follow-up protocol to ensure complete recovery. Auditory brainstem responses, neuroinflammation imaging and routine cognitive evaluation may be used for follow-up examination, as they might help assess existing or emerging brain dysfunction and objectivize further treatment.Abbreviations: ICU, Intensive Care Units; MRI, Magnetic resonance imaging; PET, Positron Emission Tomography; TBI, Traumatic Brain Injury.
