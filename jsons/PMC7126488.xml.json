The consequences for the localization and function of tumor-suppressors and oncogenes have lead to discussions of the therapeutic potential of targeting this machinery [1]. In this regard, one group of molecules of particular interest is the karyopherins. They act as carrier proteins in the selective bi-directional shuttling of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, termed nucleocytoplasmic transport.",

They participate in several nuclear transport pathways into and out of the nucleus, with the classical nuclear protein import pathway as one of the best characterized pathways.",

The karyopherin \u03b1 proteins recognize cargo proteins by virtue of their nuclear localization signal (NLS). Whereas the karyopherin \u03b1 recognizes the cargo and acts as an adaptor, the importin \u03b2 facilitates docking to and translocation through the NPC [3]. In the nucleus, importin \u03b2 is bound by RanGTP which leads to the dissociation of the ternary complex and concurrent release of the cargo [2]. Importin \u03b2 complexed with RanGTP is recycled to the cytoplasm on its own, whereas karyopherin \u03b1 bind RanGTP as well as the export factor, CAS, another member of the Importin \u03b2 family, before it is subsequently shuttled to the cytoplasm [2].",

Its domain structure was initially delineated in the mid 90s [5], [6], [7], [8]. The protein comprise an N-terminal hydrophilic importin \u03b2-binding domain, a central hydrophobic region consisting of 10 armadillo (ARM) repeats, which binds the cargo\u2019s NLS, and a short acidic C-terminus with no reported function. CAS, the factor responsible for the recycling of KPNA2 to the cytoplasm, binds the 10th ARM repeat [3]. The importin \u03b2-binding domain has been demonstrated to possess an auto-inhibitory function ensuring that KPNA2 is only translocated when bound to importin \u03b2 as well as a cargo molecule [9], [10].",

Furthermore, high KPNA2 expression has been associated with lymphatic spread and venous invasion in several cancers [12], [16], [17], [21], the latter of which is considered to be of particular importance in the process of developing distant metastases [23]. In accordance, high KPNA2 expression was coupled with a significantly increased risk of developing distant metastases in bladder cancer [22]. With further possible connections to cancer malignancy, high expression of KPNA2 has been correlated with high cellular proliferation in cancer tissue [13], [16], [17], [20], [22].

They located the promoter region responsible for the elevated promoter activity (situated at \u2212180 to \u221224 bp), and identified highly conserved binding sites for E2F transcription factors. Due to the intimate relationship between E2Fs and the retinoblastoma protein, RB, the latter was suggested to ultimately cause the KPNA2 deregulation. The recent demonstration that E2F1 is translocated by KPNA2 [25] raises the possibility that a positive feedback loop exists, where elevated activity of E2Fs may lead to increased expression of KPNA2 which in turn increases the nuclear amounts of E2Fs. Previous studies of E2F and the cell cycle have identified KPNA2 as differentially expressed through the cell cycle with the highest levels occurring in the G2/M phases [26], [27]. Regulation of the KPNA2 promoter activity appears to be somewhat cell line specific as the high expression observed in embryonic stem cells was likely instigated by Klf2 and Klf4 at a separate promoter region [28].",

As cells in advanced tumors frequently exhibit high levels of oxidative stress [33], this could explain the nuclear localization of KPNA2. The nuclear retention in response to cellular stress suppresses the nuclear transport and alter gene regulation [29], [30], [31], [32], [34], [35].

In a recent study, it was suggested that KPNA2 plays a role in the malignant transformation of cancer cells [36]. Increasing the expression of KPNA2 in a benign breast cancer cell line conferred several characteristics normally associated with malign cells such as an increase in colony formation and in cell migration activity. These findings were in line with previous studies of lung cancer cell lines, where the migratory capability had also been affected by altered KPNA2 levels [17].",

            "text": "One of the most prominent cargo proteins translocated by KPNA2 is the cell-cycle regulator Chk2 [38]. KPNA2 interacts with the NLS indispensable for Chk2 import and overexpression of KPNA2 correlates with an increased nuclear import [38]. KPNA2 has also been suggested to play a role in the nuclear translocation of BRCA1. BRCA1 is likely implicated in carcinogenesis due to its roles in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control [39]. The importance of the NLS in BRCA1 translocation has been established along with direct interaction between KPNA2 and BRCA1 [40], [41]. The observation that a BRCA1 mutant lacking both NLSs could be observed in the nucleus [42], [43] led to discovery of an alternative way to import BRCA1 [44]. The importance of each of the two alternate pathways remains to be established. Furthermore, KPNA2 is responsible for the import of NBS1, another DNA repair protein which also partake in carcinogenesis [45], [46]. This interaction was supported by the consequences of KPNA2 knockdown, which impaired the cellular capability to form regular nuclear foci in response to DNA damage [45]. An interesting connection, especially with relations to prostate cancer, is the role of KPNA2 in the import of the androgen receptor (AR) [19], [47]. Binding of the active androgen to AR leads to its nuclear import where it activates the transcription of a range of target genes. As a consequence, it has been speculated that the high level of KPNA2 observed in prostate cancer tissue might be indicative of an increase in translocation of AR and therefore associated with hormone-refractory prostate cancer [19].",

As transcription factors, these proteins are involved in a variety of processes, however, deregulation in cancer plays a prominent role [54], [55], [56], [57], [58]. Furthermore, KPNA2 has been shown to abrogate the induction of the LOT1 downstream target p21WAF1/CIP1 which holds both tumor suppressive and oncogenic potential [52], [59]. Finally, the small Rho-GTPase RAC-1 is also translocated by KPNA2 [60].

Furthermore, KPNA2 has been identified to translocate Taspase 1, a protease with developmentally important downstream targets [67], and Oct4 [68], [69], a major gatekeeper in development [70]. Other reports include the findings of varying levels of import factors through spermatogenesis [71], myogenesis [72] and early embryogenesis [73]. For brain development it has been demonstrated that an exquisite downregulation of KPNA2 is a prerequisite during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells [69]. The already mentioned cargoes Oct4 and LOT1 have roles in brain differentiation [55], [69] as has yet another transcription factor, E47, which is also shuttled by KPNA2 [74]. Of potential interest is also the observation of aberrantly localized KPNA2 in hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer Disease [75].",

Furthermore, KPNA2 has been proposed to hold a role in regulating viral capsid assembly, preventing it from faultily occurring in the cytoplasm [82]. An alternate way of affecting viral infection has been demonstrated for the SARS coronavirus which sequesters KPNA2 to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane, thereby preventing nuclear translocation of STAT1, an important messenger in host-defense against viruses [83]. Interestingly, karyopherins have also been proposed to define host specificity of viruses as demonstrated recently for the influenza virus [84].",

KPNA2 activity might also be regulated by Ca2+ levels via interactions with the S100A6 protein [100]. Furthermore, KPNA2 is involved in controlling the intracellular redox environment through translocation of the thioredoxin-binding protein-2 (TBP-2) [101]. Regarding RNA metabolism, KPNA2 has been shown to import RNA-editing adenosine deaminases (ADARs) [102], partake in the formation of RNA stress granules [103] and interact with the Poly(A) Binding Protein (PABPC) involved in the regulation of mRNA levels [104]. The increasing number of interaction partners for KPNA2 indicates that it is truly a jack-of-all-trades.",

            "text": "Due to its function in nucleocytoplasmic transport, where it mediates the translocation of a multitude of proteins, KPNA2 is involved in many cellular processes. Nonetheless, the association with cancer appears to be very prominent, considering the aberrantly high levels of KPNA2 observed across cancers of diverse origin. Importantly, the altered expression pattern is associated with adverse patient characteristics. This spurs the idea that KPNA2 may hold a role in carcinogenesis. This idea is supported by the cellular studies of KPNA2 which have indicated that the protein may play a role in the malignant transformation of cells. The association with adverse cancer characteristics establishes KPNA2 as a potentially relevant therapeutic target. However, targeting of the protein will be complicated by the great number of conventional cellular processes which are also associated with KPNA2. Instead, utilization as a cancer biomarker may well be the first clinical implementation of KPNA2. Considering the results described here, obtained in a variety of cancer forms, this vision appears promising. Further prospective clinical studies are required to fully demonstrate the biomarker potential of KPNA2, and, in fact, KPNA2 is part of a translational effort in bladder cancer and is currently being investigated in ongoing multi-center prospective studies [105].",

Elucidating the interactions that connect KPNA2 to carcinogenesis is complicated by the fact that karyopherins can have overlapping preferences for cargo proteins [3]. We have presented some of the currently identified interaction partners. However, it should be kept in mind that, at present, many interaction partners might remain unknown, and these cargo proteins could act individually as well as in concert with known as well as unknown interaction partners. Nonetheless, the pronounced deregulation of KPNA2 in cancer, and the suggested role in malignant transformation, warrants further studies of this protein and its function in carcinogenesis.",
