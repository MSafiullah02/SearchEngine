Employing a sampling 81 system with physical separation of patients (source case) and guinea pigs (sampler) led to the confirmation of 82 airborne transmission. Moreover, intricate linking of individual patients to specific guinea pig infections by 83 bacillary resistance patterns and timing of entry and departure from the ward allowed for identification of a 84 minority of highly infectious 'super-spreaders'. The guinea pig model therefore supported the concepts that 85 infectiousness is highly heterogenous and that small bioaerosol -which arise as a consequence of dehydration 86 of buoyant airborne droplets during \"aging\" following release into the environment -are primarily responsible 87 for remote transmission [6]. 88 Invaluable though this contribution was to the early understanding of TB transmission, the experimental design 89 was not optimised for sensitive sampling [7]. Minimal sensitivity to Mtb production necessitates sampling 90 multiple patients for days to months for both historical and recent in vivo sampling experiments [8-10]. 91 However, some modern approaches with greater proximity between source case and sampler, single patient 92 sampling and viable organism detection have dramatically improved the overall detection sensitivity. Direct 93 detection has identified Mtb bacilli within only minutes to hours of sampling [11-13], generated individual-level 94 information, and found a greater proportion of emitters. 95 These sensitive techniques have the potential to efficiently answer questions regarding the transmission 96 potential of patient sub-groups and test strategies for transmission mitigation. Further sensitivity improvement 97 may allow investigation of Mtb-containing droplet release from patients across the TB disease spectrum, 98 including sputum smear-negative cases, HIV-coinfected and even subclinical TB cases. Sensitive sampling 99 combined with quantitative forms of detection also provide an infectivity measure.

Consistent 226 with prior observations [6], these are the particles thought most likely to reach the peripheral lungs of 227 susceptible individuals sharing an indoor location [17]. It is also probable that these bioaerosols containing 228 viable Mtb organisms might be indicative of a wide range of source infectivity. The investigation of Mtb 229 production and, consequently, potential infectivity during various respiratory manoeuvres is under current 230 investigation in our laboratory. 231 The sensitive detection of individual Mtb organisms, with DMN-Trehalose staining and subsequent fluorescence 232 microscopy analysis, requires a high degree of sterility to exclude contamination during sampling and isolation. 233 After detailed analysis of the platform and collection equipment, we noted that the wet-walled cyclone 234 contained a dead space which was a potential reservoir for live Mtb cells. Therefore, the device was modified to 235 enable dismantling and autoclaving. The very low numbers of Mtb organisms detected during empty booth 236 sampling could also have resulted from the release of trapped Mtb organisms by the negative pressure inducing 237 retrograde airflow across the exit HEPA filter. Reassuringly, following modification of the collector and the 238 application of combined dry vapour hydrogen peroxide and ozone treatments of the RASC after use, of a sensitive and reproducible measure of Mtb in exhaled bioaerosols has enabled the 242 demonstration of a wide range of potential infectivity of newly diagnosed TB patients. Bioaerosol assays may 243 offer a useful adjunct to TB transmission studies, enabling demonstration of infectivity of sputum negative 244 individuals and the effect of specific chemotherapies on infectivity. Moreover, the protocols and equipment 245 described here suggest the potential application of this technology to other airborne infectious diseases, 246 especially where rapid interventions such as containment and quarantine are required to curb outbreaks [18in a Major South African City Stratified by Age and HIV-Status.
