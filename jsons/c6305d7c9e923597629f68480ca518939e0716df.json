Recently, an increasing number of these \"microglial signatures\" have been reported in various homeostatic and disease contexts. Remarkably, many of these states show similar overlapping microglial gene expression patterns, both in homeostasis and in disease or injury. In this review, we integrate information from these studies, and we propose a unique subset, for which we introduce a core signature, based on our own research and reports from the literature.

Added to this was the constant difficulty of discriminating CNSresident parenchymal microglia from blood-derived myeloid cells, with which they share many markers [reviewed in Amici et al. (26) ].

Functional analyses led to discrepant results suggesting either protective, immunosuppressive function as well as enhanced capacity for uptake and lysosomal degradation of A\u03b2 (73) , or pathogenicity via possible contribution to local arginine deprivation and subsequent neurodegeneration (111) . Butovsky's group also proposed a detrimental role for these cells due to ameliorated A\u03b2 deposition in 4-month-old TREM2-deficient mice that lack CD11c+ microglia (75) . However, the role of TREM2 is not clear, since other data show either protective or detrimental roles for this protein depending on the age of the animals (75, (112) (113) (114) .

Microglial activation in the disease arises from accumulation of misfolded protein, and, similarly to observations made in other disease contexts, microglia have been reported to play a beneficial role in the pre-symptomatic phase of the disease before shifting to detrimental roles in the advanced disease state (122) .

Studying microglia in context of inflammation can get quite complicated due to massive infiltration of peripheral immune cells, notably monocytes and macrophages, occurring subsequently to TBI (128) , SCI (129) , and stroke (127, 130, 131) . In a study comparing the transcriptomics of microglia and macrophages after ischemia in rats, it was reported that microglia played a detrimental role and macrophages played a beneficial role with regard to recovery, based on their expression of classical inflammation markers (132) . Investigation of the genes enriched in microglia three days after middle cerebral artery occlusion compared to sham controls, however, revealed Spp1, Gpnmb, Lgals3, Fabp5, and Axl among others, fitting with the potential presence of CD11c+ microglia-like cells in this context, diluted among other microglia. Consistent with this, Ccl2 mRNA was found to be increased in microglia and macrophages at this time point (132) , an aspect that has been associated with the emergence of CD11c+ microglia (81) . Another study, conducted in a model of phototrombic stroke on whole tissue, actually showed upregulation of Gpnmb, Itgax, and Clec7a in a cluster associated with early response (133) , which the authors related to the DAM phenotype (74) .

TREM2-deficient animals were shown to downregulate the CD11c+ microglia signature in cuprizone-induced demyelination (144) and in an AD model (113) . In addition, in the study from the Amit lab, TREM2 deficiency in an AD mouse model led to an arrest of microglia in an intermediate state between the homeostatic state and the CD11c+ microglia stage. Barely any microglia in these mice exhibited the CD11c+ microglial signature (74) . This suggests that CD11c+ microglia induction is a two-step process, where the first step, to leave the homeostatic state, is TREM2-independent and the second step, to reach the complete CD11c+ microglia phenotype, is TREM2-dependent. These observations were confirmed by Krasemann et al. in another TREM2-deficient AD model (75) . Similarly, APOEdeficient mice exhibit lower numbers of CD11c+ microglia in AD, ALS, and MS mouse models (75, 80) . This is suggestive of a positive feedback loop, as this population itself strongly upregulates APOE (75) . Surprisingly, the Barres lab showed that induction of CD11c+ microglia during postnatal development in contrast to adulthood is TREM2-APOE-independent (24) . A similar TREM2 independence of CD11c+ microglia induction was shown in the developing retina (71). FIGURE 2 | CD11c+ microglia signature in disease states. In diseased CNS, CD11c+ microglia adopt an amoeboid, reactive morphology. In AD, they are found surrounding A\u03b2 plaques. Similarly, in MS and ALS models and in injury, they are found around and in the lesions. In glioma, they are found mixed with tumor cells. CD11c+ microglia numbers in diseased CNS vary considerably, ranging from 10 to 50% of all microglia. Comparison of genes upregulated in four studies (35, (73) (74) (75) reveals a common signature for CD11c+ disease microglia of 89 genes upregulated in at least three of the studies (bold dark outline).

Of note, induction of this phenotype was not observed upon microglia exposure to Escherichia coli, zymosan particles (75), or microparticles (Marczynska et al., unpublished), suggesting that induction of CD11c+ microglia is a tightly controlled reaction to local cell damage or apoptosis, rather than to phagocytosis itself. Interestingly, microglial necroptosis in demyelination models leads to brain repopulation with CD11c+ microglia from nestin+ resident microglia (148) . Similarly, nestin+ microglia colonizing the brain after microglia ablation expressed surface CD11c (98) . The gene expression in repopulating microglia highly overlapped with the CD11c+ microglia signature. We showed that genetic or toxin-induced ablation of neonatal CD11c+ cells led to their instant repopulation (35) . Whether the observed concomitant decrease of CD11c\u2212 microglia (35) reflects induction of CD11c+ phenotype in CD11c\u2212 cells by phagocytosis of dying microglia has not been determined. Interestingly, a dramatic decrease in CD11c+ microglia was observed in the postnatal retina of mice deficient in Bax, a pro-apoptotic gene that is essential for developmental death of neurons (71) . This emphasizes that apoptotic cells are a strong and common inducer of CD11c+ microglia regardless of age and condition. This is also in line with several studies where developmental cell death has been linked FIGURE 3 | Core CD11c+ microglia signature. Considering similarities between the transcriptomic signatures and functions in the CD11c+ microglia subset in development and in disease, we compared both signatures to obtain a core of genes upregulated in this subset across all conditions.

Thus, we believe that a unification of the nomenclature by referring to the microglial subset expressing the described signature, from development to old age, as CD11c+ microglia is a necessary step to progress our understanding of microglia biology. This subset emerges in development before contracting during adulthood but is triggered to re-emerge in aging as well as in the context of disease or tissue injury (Figure 4) . The summary of the data that mentioned microglia showing the aforementioned signature strongly points to the importance FIGURE 4 | CD11c+ microglia as a subset of microglia present through life and across conditions. Our investigation leads us to believe that CD11c+ microglia represent a subset of microglia characterized by a robust signature of 22 genes expressed by this subset at any age and in various disease states. Emergence of this subset is induced by various factors including signaling through the TREM2-APOE pathway, cell death, IL-4 signaling, and cytokine signaling through CSF1R inducing CCL2, and is inhibited by CD47/SIRP\u03b1 signaling. In physiological conditions, CD11c+ microglia account for around 15% of all microglia, before contracting to 2% in adulthood and being re-induced by aging at levels similar to development. In disease states, their numbers oscillate between 10 and 50%. We argue that despite the numerous names given to this subset across conditions, it is unique and should be referred to as \"CD11c+ microglia\". of CD11c+ microglia in primary myelination during CNS development as well as their protective, remyelinative, and regenerative capacities in CNS pathology.
