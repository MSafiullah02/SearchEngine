The HA exists as a trimer of three identical monomers formed by noncovalent association. Each monomer consists of a globular head and a stalk region anchored in the viral envelope by a short hydrophobic sequence. Within the globular head is the receptor-binding site, a shallow pocket of highly conserved amino acids that interact with N-acetylneuraminic acid (commonly referred to as SA), expressed on oligosaccharide side-chains of cell-surface glycoproteins and glycolipids [6 -8] . Following attachment, virus is internalized via endocytosis, and HA undergoes conformational changes in the low pH of the endosomal compartment to expose the fusion peptide at the N-terminus of the HA 2 subunit [9, 10] .
