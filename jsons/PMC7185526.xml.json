It involves a variety of governmental and non-governmental agencies, including fire, emergency medical services (EMS), hospitals, police, and public health (Rudman et al., 2003), with overlapping jurisdictions and competing agendas and interests (Landesman, 2001; Heinrich, 2001; NRC, 2002). For example, the evidence-gathering requirements of law enforcement may potentially conflict with the patient confidentiality requirements of medical providers. Also, some agencies, such as local public health agencies and hospitals, may not be as involved in disaster planning efforts as they should be (IOM, 2002; NRC, 2002). The challenges of effective collaboration and communication among agencies are made even greater when the agencies are limited in resources and funding (IOM, 2002; Rudman et al., 2003), a situation often found in rural areas (ORHP, 2002).",

After considering what would be required to model the entire system with all of its interacting organizations, we concluded that it would be most practical to first identify and define the internal challenges of single organizations, before considering multiple organizations simultaneously. Following this approach, we are now engaged in a study of a single hospital's surge capacity. The next step would be to look at how that hospital fits into a regional healthcare response, and subsequently into an overall community response. Ultimately, we foresee the possibility of developing a comprehensive model of community disaster planning that considers all major agencies and organizations.",

On the whole, the programs and regulations that do exist, although providing tools for planning, may lack systematic integration and consistency, effective means to address major problems or issues, and may be difficult to administer in practice (Rudman et al., 2003; Becker et al., 2003; Rubin, 2004).",

            "text": "Complex public health problems have often proved resistant to simple solutions. The difficulty of dealing effectively with such problems has led to calls for systems approaches, including application of the theory of complex adaptive systems (IOM, 2001). However, there is no single definition of what constitutes a systems approach, a term which has been used variously to describe:\u2022team-building facilitation and \u201clearning organization\u201d techniques that help multiple stakeholders work together more effectively (Senge, 1990);\u2022so-called \u201cqualitative modeling\u201d or \u201csoft operations research\u201d or \u201csystems thinking\u201d methods that, through the use of cause-and-effect diagramming tools, help leaders diagnose problems and design better functioning organizations (Checkland, 1981; Wolstenholme and Coyle, 1983; Senge, 1990);\u2022the development and use of computerized simulation models that can permit the analysis of complex problems not amenable to conventional statistical techniques (Meadows and Robinson, 1985; Sterman, 1988).In the spectrum of systems approaches, System Dynamics (SD) is among the most quantitative and analytical, though it is also decidedly problem-focused and policy-oriented. SD applications involve the development of causal diagrams and computer simulation models that are unique to each problem setting. The types of problems to which SD has been applied are too numerous to mention. In the health field specifically, studies go back more than 30 years and include a variety of studies of healthcare delivery (Levin et al., 1976; Gardner, 1991; Hirsch and Immediato, 1999; Lane, 2000; Homer et al., 2004) and population health and epidemiology (Levin et al., 1975; Homer and St. Clair, 1991; Homer, 1993; Tengs et al., 2001). The causal diagrams of an SD application are often created by groups of diverse stakeholders and subject matter experts brought together for the purpose of establishing a common framework for policy analysis (Vennix, 1996). The simulation models themselves are typically constructed by specially trained experts who take the ideas and data of the stakeholder group and integrate them into an interlocking set of equations. A single SD model typically consists of a multitude of such equations, constructed and refined through an iterative process of scope selection, hypothesis generation, causal diagramming, quantification, reliability testing, and policy analysis (Sterman, 2000).",

A central tenet of SD is that the difficult-to-change and difficult-to-anticipate behaviors of organizational and social systems are the result of ongoing accumulations and both balancing and reinforcing feedback mechanisms, which we can only hope to dissect with the aid of computer models. The unique contribution of SD to policy analysis is not the notion that feedback is important (an idea that has been around in various forms for centuries) but is the practical application of this fundamental concept in the form of models that can be tested, calibrated, and refined in a rigorous and scientific way (Forrester and Senge, 1980; Randers, 1980; Morecroft, 1985; Richardson, 1991; Homer, 1996; Sterman, 2000, Sterman, 2001).",

Commonly, in the social sciences, one thinks of research as involving experimentation done directly on the subject of interest. To obtain reliable results from such direct experimentation, a large enough sample is required with a minimum of uncontrolled variables. This sort of research may be readily performed in relatively simple systems, but becomes increasingly impractical and unreliable in systems with multiple interacting actors and \u201cmoving parts\u201d. However, multiple actors and moving parts are precisely what one finds when considering the complexities of disaster planning. Aside from certain simple measures of capacity, and preparedness drills limited to a single organization or one possible disaster scenario out of many, direct research is of limited practical value in this context.",

The difficulty with this approach, not surprisingly, is that the virtual world is not identical to the real world, and may differ from it in some significant way that invalidates the simulation results. For this reason, the assumptions in a simulation model must be carefully vetted, and the model carefully tested for its accuracy and realism under all possible scenarios (Forrester and Senge, 1980; Morecroft, 1985; Homer, 1996). To the extent that the parameter values and other assumptions are uncertain, it is important to perform a full battery of sensitivity tests to determine the significance of such uncertainty to the experimental findings.",

Such non-trivial planning issues exist even within a single organization, like a hospital, and we suggest that may be the best place to demonstrate the value of SD.

What is the feasibility of rapid re-education of new staff? Or, approaching the problem more preventively, what are the factors leading to turnover and can these be mitigated?\u2022\nCoordination of medical care and public health resources: The traditional separation between the medical care community (e.g., hospitals, physicians, nursing homes) and the public health community needs to be bridged in preparation for mass casualty incidents. Mass casualties will provide more work than any organization itself can address. Coordination is the key, and the historic separation is a genuine disadvantage... Funds should be provided to a community-wide organization which is required to involve the community's political leadership, public safety services, public health services, hospitals, and community health centers.\u2022\nMass casualty preparedness as a community-wide effort: If the disaster is a mass casualty event, such as a major earthquake or biological terrorism, the patient load may overwhelm all of the hospitals, the offices of physicians, and the general resources of the community... Therefore, hospital preparedness should expand from planning within the context of a single hospital organization to planning by the hospital to become part of a community-wide initiative to address mass casualties (Hirsch 2004 describes an SD study taking this community-wide approach to mass casualty preparedness).\n",

Models allow for flexibility of circumstances and can assist disaster planners, particularly those in rural areas, in determining better ways to address issues with fewer resources. In theory, planners should be able to more accurately plan for many possible contingencies, for resource and personnel allocation, and for effective collaboration with other agencies and jurisdictions. When used in conjunction with available empirical data and what is known through the medical literature, models and simulations can help provide the evidence base for nationally consistent standards and guidelines. The simulation-based approach is depicted in Fig. 1\n, our revised version of Brownson's framework for evidence-based public health, where \u201cquantify the issue\u201d has been replaced with \u201cmodel the issue and analyze options\u201d (Brownson et al., 1999). In this figure, we also show how modeling is an iterative process in which policy options emerge through multiple rounds of model refinement (see the feedback link, \u201crefine analysis\u201d) (Homer, 1996; Sterman, 2000).",

This shift in approach could provide at minimum, the following advantages:\u2022more balanced programs that address the concerns that some public health practitioners may have that disaster preparedness is a case of robbing Peter (e.g., chronic and communicable disease programs) to pay Paul (e.g., bioterrorism),\u2022more sustainable programs, conceived in a broader way, and paid out of several funding sources that come from federal agencies and grants, and\u2022healthier communities through greater emphasis on prevention and mitigation strategies, achieved largely through broad-based education and training programs.Through these activities, communities would become more aware of possible risks and would work to minimize those risks or eliminate them altogether, thus creating communities that are likely to withstand any disaster they may happen to face. Computer simulation models could also assist public health in its newly prominent role in disaster and emergency planning. Epidemiological models have already proved their value in predicting epidemics outbreaks. Public health departments have now been given the additional challenge of facilitating emergency response and require tools that not only predict, but can also be useful, in the design of effective general procedures and contingency plans.",

Computer models and simulations could allow local planners to develop templates or plans for the more effective allocation of resources as an event proceeds (Hupert et al., 2002).
