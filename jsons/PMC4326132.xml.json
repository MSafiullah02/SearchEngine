The ability of HCV to inhibit the activation of endogenous type I interferon (IFN) system could underlie its success in establishing a chronic infection [2]. Type I IFN comprises a family of about 20 members that bind a common receptor complex, the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) [3]. IFNs exhibit direct antiviral activity by inducing an antiviral state through expression of various intracellular genes (IFN-stimulated genes, ISGs), including IP10, whose levels are known to be prognostic factors of viral response to standard of care therapy (SOC) [4\u20136]. A group of recently discovered cytokines (IFN-lambda1/interleukin-29 [IL-29], IFN-lambda2/IL-28A, and IFN-lambda3/IL-28B, also designated IFNL1 to 3, respectively), assigned to a new type of IFN (type III IFN), gained increased attention in the HCV field [7]. The biological activity of type III IFN overlaps to some extent with that of type I IFN, and similar subsets of ISGs are induced as well [8]. However, there are important kinetic differences in the induction of ISGs by type I and type III IFN, and these differences may indeed produce distinct functional activities [9].",

Numerous investigators confirmed the importance of IFNL3 SNPs in the therapeutic response of HCV patients to SOC [14,15]. Among the identified SNPs, rs12979860 appeared the most relevant, being the rs12979860-favorable CC genotype associated with a more than two-fold increased rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) with respect to hapless (CT or TT) genotypes [16]. More recently, a new transiently induced gene near the IFNL3 gene has been discovered, harbouring a dinucleotide variant ss469415590 (TT or \u0394G), which is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860. The ss469415590 [\u0394G] allele is a frameshift variant that creates a novel gene, IFNL4, encoding a fully functional protein designated interferon-lambda 4 (IFNL4) [17,18]. The ss469415590 [TT] allele, which abrogates the production of the IFNL4 protein, is considered the favourable haplotype towards response to SOC, while the ss469415590 [\u0394G] is considered the unfavourable one [18,19].",

To this respect, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are important players in the struggle against HCV [21\u201323], and, although not considered as main target of HCV replication, their functions are impaired by indirect mechanisms involving HCV-induced cytokines or viral products [24\u201327]. It has been shown that enhanced expression of ISGs, not only in the liver, but also in PBMC, is a negative prognostic factor of virological response to IFN therapy [5, 28\u201330].",
