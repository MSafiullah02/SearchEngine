For sake of argument, say we have 8 fatalities, 388 officially confirmed cases, and 1956 true infections in Gangelt, while we have 7928 fatalities, 174975 confirmed cases, and an unknown true prevalence in Germany. 6 By the rule of proportions, we could back out an estimate of nationwide prevalence either as 1956 \u00d7 7928/8 = 1938396 (an update of the study's preferred estimate) or as 1956 \u00d7 174975/388 = 882090 (extrapolating the undercount). The numbers differ by so much because the crude case fatality rate (CFR) equals 8/388 = 2.1% for Gangelt and 7928/174975 = 4.5% for Germany. Thus, assuming that the IFR (interpreted as population-level expectation) is actually the same, Gangelt either tested more or got really lucky. By extrapolating the local IFR, the study assumes the former but without discussing this assumption.",

Should we really prioritize the former over the latter in extrapolation? Or was Gangelt indeed just lucky? This is marginally implausible in that the (exact binomial) two-sided p-value for the former sample being drawn from the latter urn is 2.6%. But modest demographic difference between Gangelt and Germany, or accounting for clustered sampling of both numerator and denominator (the sample units were households; the superspreading event apparently spared local nursing homes), could easily compensate for that. What's more, the fatality count meanwhile increased to 9. While it is not clear that this fatality was among the infected during the study's time frame, adding it would change the aforementioned p-value to 5.2%.",

However, that does not logically imply that Gangelt had more testing relative to true prevalence. My complaint is that this case was not made, and a different extrapolation that would align the study with other recent seroprevalence studies (and have shorter confidence intervals to boot) was not discussed. A balanced analysis might well provide both and also some form of interpolation. Partial identification would be one framework close to my heart, but the primary concern is transparency about how different identifying assumptions would interact with the data at hand.",
