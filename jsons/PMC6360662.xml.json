In 2016, there were 10.4 million incident cases of tuberculosis and 1.7 million deaths due to the disease [1]. Although the prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis in China fell from 170 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 59 per 100,000 people in 2010 [2], the burden remains high. Indeed, China has the third-highest incidence of tuberculosis after India and Indonesia [1]. Medical advances, lifestyle changes and improvements in socioeconomic factors have resulted in people in China living longer than before [3], but with poorer physical and mental health than their counterparts 10 years ago [4]. Furthermore, the prolongation of lifespan has led to an increase in the number of elderly people with tuberculosis.",

In particular, elderly patients with tuberculosis tend to have more extensive pulmonary lesions, higher sputum positivity, a higher susceptibility to the adverse effects of anti-tuberculosis drugs (including hepatic dysfunction) and higher mortality [5\u20138]. Elderly patients with tuberculosis have a lower completion rate than younger patients [9, 10] and are considered by some healthcare workers to be an \u201cobstacle\u201d to the control of tuberculosis in China [11].

The apparent variation between studies may be related to differences in the incidence of tuberculosis, treatment strategies used or definitions of adverse reactions, as well as other factors. The incidence of adverse reactions in the present study was substantially higher than the average national incidence in China. This is likely due to the patients in our study being critically ill and thus treated in the Department of Tuberculosis Intensive Care Unit. Critically ill patients are likely to have more comorbidities and more severe disease, which would be expected to make them more susceptible to the development of adverse reactions induced by anti-tuberculosis drugs. To our knowledge, the incidence of adverse reactions to anti-tuberculosis drugs in critically ill patients has not been reported previously, either in China or elsewhere.",

In this study, logistic regression analysis identified COPD as an independent factor associated with the withdrawal of anti-tuberculosis treatment in critically ill patients with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis combined with COPD is thought to be the leading cause of death due to respiratory infection [31]. Tuberculosis leads to decreased lung volume and airway stenosis, which are risk factors for the occurrence of COPD, while long-term use of steroids for COPD leads to decreased immune function, which is a risk factor for tuberculosis. Thus, there is an association between tuberculosis and COPD [31, 32]. In this study, the number of patients with COPD and the mortality rate were both significantly higher in the drug withdrawal group than in the therapy completion group, which would be consistent with comorbid COPD increasing the risk of death in patients with tuberculosis, as has been reported previously [33, 34].",

Tuberculosis-associated anemia is a recognized phenomenon but is usually mild and resolves following successful pharmacologic therapy [40]. However, anti-tuberculosis drugs can cause hematologic abnormalities, including anemia, during intensive therapy [41]. It is possible that patients with a lower baseline hemoglobin level before the initiation of treatment are more susceptible to reductions in hemoglobin level caused by therapy, which in turn would make drug withdrawal due to the manifestation of adverse events more likely. Another possibility is that low hemoglobin levels impair the effectiveness of anti-tuberculosis therapy. Consistent with this possibility, anemia was found to be associated with delayed sputum conversion after therapy, and it was suggested that the impaired response to treatment in those with low hemoglobin levels may be due to malnourishment and impaired T cell immunity secondary to zinc and iron deficiency [42]. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism underlying the association between pre-therapy hemoglobin level and subsequent drug withdrawal.",

            "text": "In this study, abnormalities of liver and kidney function, thrombocytopenia and disease deterioration accounted for around 70% of cases of drug withdrawal. Hepatic injury was the most common adverse reaction caused by anti-tuberculosis drugs, as described in other publications [24]. The incidence reported in previous studies vary greatly, from 2 to 28% [27], possibly due to differences in the criteria used to evaluate liver dysfunction, population characteristics and treatment regimens. The rate of drug withdrawal due to liver damage in this study was 22.7%, similar to that reported previously [43]. Rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide are the main anti-tuberculosis drugs that cause liver damage [44], which likely explains why the frequencies of withdrawal of these drugs were higher than those of the other drugs in this study. Allergic reactions are also commonly encountered during the treatment of tuberculosis, and the incidence of allergic reactions in this study was similar to the incidence of 3.4\u201317.8% reported during standard therapy [45]. The allergic reactions reported in this study were mild and mainly manifested as urticaria and drug fever, with no cases of exfoliative dermatitis or bullous dermatitis. The incidence of thrombocytopenia as an adverse reaction of anti-tuberculosis drugs has been rarely reported, although it has been mentioned in case reports [46, 47]. In patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the rate of thrombocytopenia as an adverse reaction to anti-tuberculosis medication was 17.3% [48], similar to the incidence observed in the present study. It is worth noting that patients with tuberculosis also have immune dysfunction [49], although the underlying mechanisms need further exploration. Renal dysfunction was a relatively rare adverse reaction in our study, although its incidence was similar to that reported in the literature (7.1%) [50]. Fungal infections cannot be ignored in critically ill patients (since this is known to increase the risk of death), and some patients in this study needed anti-Aspergillus treatment with voriconazole. Since rifampicin is an inducer of CYP450, which reduces the blood concentration of voriconazole, it was discontinued during antifungal treatment. In addition, drug withdrawal in some patients was related to a continuous deterioration in their clinical condition, with worsening respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability. The other, less common reasons for drug withdrawal were likely not related to anti-tuberculosis medication and included gastrointestinal bleeding, malignant arrhythmias, psychiatric symptoms and the results of drug susceptibility testing.",
