Patients with COVID-19 are in a hypercoagulable state, with blood stasis and endothelial injury due to inflammation; in addition, most elderly patients with severe COVID-19 have a previous medical history of hypertension and atherosclerosis (1) (2) (3) (4) . As a result, elderly patients with COVID-19 are at high risk of thrombosis and embolism. In the present article, we report a case of a 75-year-old woman diagnosed with severe COVID-19, complicated by acute cerebral infarction and venous thrombosis of the bilateral lower extremities. The patient successfully recovered after symptomatic and supportive treatments and received rehabilitation training after discharge. Arterial and venous thrombosis could occur simultaneously and lead to poor prognosis, which should be considered and prudently managed in patients with COVID-19.",

Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral interstitial ground glass-like shadows and multiple consolidations (Figure 1) , and the nucleic acid detection of COVID-19 was positive in the local hospital before admission. Because of blood oxygen saturation of 85%, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 (severe) according to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (4th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China (5) , and was transferred to the isolation ward of our hospital. Her previous medical history of hypertension for 20 years was notable. At admission on 5 February 2020, her physical examination was normal and oxygen saturation was 95% with 3 L/min oxygen inhalation of the nasal catheter. After admission, the laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was validated again with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommended Kit (1, 2) immediately after admission. Blood routine test showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.60 \u00d7 10 9 /L (Reference: 3.5-9.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L), neutrophils percentage (NE%) of 84.7% (Reference: 40-75%), lymphocyte percentage (LY%) of 12.2% (Reference: 20-50%), hemoglobin 120 g/L (Reference: 115-150 g/L), and platelet 119 \u00d7 10 9 /L (Reference: 125-350 \u00d7 10 9 /L). The C-reactive protein (CRP) was markedly increased with the level of 42.52 mg/L (Reference: 0-8 mg/L); and the procalcitonin (PCT) was slightly increased with the level of 0.14 ng/mL (Reference: <0.05 ng/mL). Coagulation function measurement showed that D-dimer was slightly increased with the level of 0.83 \u00b5g/mL (Reference: 0-0.5 \u00b5g/mL), and prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was normal. Biochemical examination displayed serum creatinine (CREA) of 70 \u00b5mol/L (Reference: 57.0-111.0 \u00b5mol/L), urea nitrogen (BUN) 3.98 mmol/L (Reference: 2.9-8.2 \u00b5mol/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 30 U/L (Reference: 5-40 U/L), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 45 U/L (Reference: 8-40 U/L). Cardiac lesion biomarkers were normal. The electrocardiogram was normal, but a cardiac/carotid artery sonography was not performed. The patient was treated immediately with arbidol (0.2 g, three times per day, po) as an antiviral agent, cefoperazone/sulbactam (2.0 g/1.0 g, three times per day, iv.drip) for antibiotic treatment, methylprednisolone (40 mg, once per day, iv) for anti-inflammatory treatment, and symptomatic and supportive treatments. On 12 February 2020 (1 week after admission), she gradually felt better, and her symptoms were gradually relieved.",

We could not, however, fully evaluate facial involvement, motor coordination, muscle tonus, and sensory functions because the medical and human resources available were limited.

Rechecked blood routine test showed WBC 10.76 \u00d7 10 9 /L, neutrophils percentage (NE%) of 85.3%, lymphocyte percentage (LY%) of 9.8%, hemoglobin 106 g/L, and platelet 106 \u00d7 10 9 /L.

Coagulation function measurement showed that D-dimer >8 \u00b5g/mL, and PT and APTT was normal. A vascular ultrasound of the lower extremities showed extensive atherosclerosis, posterior tibial, and intermuscular venous thrombosis of the bilateral lower extremities. Rechecked urine routine test, stool routine test, liver function, renal function, and cardiac lesion biomarkers were normal. Because of relieved respiratory symptoms and decreased levels of inflammation markers, we continued treating with mannitol (50 g, once per day, iv.drip) to decrease the intracranial pressure, together with aspirin (100 mg, once per day, po) and clopidogrel (75 mg, once per day, po), and added rivaroxaban (15 mg, once per day, po) for anticoagulant treatment, and did not change the treatment for COVID-19.

The present case initially showed manifestations of severe COVID-19. While the patient was being treated for COVID-19, the sudden onset of neurological symptoms and findings of the head CT scan strongly indicated cerebral infarction in the patient. Meanwhile, our patient had normal coagulation, but showed elevated D-dimer levels, also suggesting a hypercoagulable state. However, the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated cerebral infarction remain unelucidated. It has been speculated that COVID-19 may disrupt the integrity of the vascular endothelium and upset the equilibrium between coagulation and anticoagulation by eliciting an inflammatory response, which may lead to hypercoagulation and thrombosis (2) .",

Therefore, evaluating the risk of DVT is of crucial importance in reducing the morbidity and mortality rate. High-risk DVT patients are usually over 40 years old, with more than 3 days of bed rest, and display one of the following characteristics: is over 75 years old, respiratory failure, heart failure, previous thrombosis history, acute cerebral infarction, and so on (11) . In the present case, the patient had long-time hypertension, atherosclerosis, and respiratory failure; she was also in bed for more than 3 days. A vascular ultrasound of the lower extremities showed posterior tibial and intermuscular venous thrombosis of bilateral lower extremities. Therefore, for these patients, early properly antithrombotic treatment should be considered to prevent possible subsequent thrombosis events.",

Thus, we inferred that there is a possibility that the infarction was already there before admission or that it occurred right after admission but it might be difficult for physicians to have been aware of the hemiparesis during the first 10 days of treatment because the patient was too sick. Second, there might have been an old infarction in the right middle cerebral artery area without motor area involvement, but a new infarction occurred in the motor area or corticospinal tract during hospitalization. In this case the CT findings might be atypical, because the new lesion is adjacent to or surrounded by the old lesion.",
