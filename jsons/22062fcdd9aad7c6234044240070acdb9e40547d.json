            "text": "| Asthma is the most common inflammatory disease of the lungs. The prevalence of asthma is increasing in many parts of the world that have adopted aspects of the Western lifestyle, and the disease poses a substantial global health and economic burden. Asthma involves both the large-conducting and the small-conducting airways, and is characterized by a combination of inflammation and structural remodelling that might begin in utero. Disease progression occurs in the context of a developmental background in which the postnatal acquisition of asthma is strongly linked with allergic sensitization. Most asthma cases follow a variable course, involving viral-induced wheezing and allergen sensitization, that is associated with various underlying mechanisms (or endotypes) that can differ between individuals. Each set of endotypes, in turn, produces specific asthma characteristics that evolve across the lifecourse of the patient. Strong genetic and environmental drivers of asthma interconnect through novel epigenetic mechanisms that operate prenatally and throughout childhood. Asthma can spontaneously remit or begin de novo in adulthood, and the factors that lead to the emergence and regression of asthma, irrespective of age, are poorly understood. Nonetheless, there is mounting evidence that supports a primary role for structural changes in the airways with asthma acquisition, on which altered innate immune mechanisms and microbiota interactions are superimposed. On the basis of the identification of new causative pathways, the subphenotyping of asthma across the lifecourse of patients is paving the way for more-personalized and precise pathway-specific approaches for the prevention and treatment of asthma, creating the real possibility of total prevention and cure for this chronic inflammatory disease.",

Asthma involves a history of respiratory symptoms -including wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough -that vary over time and in intensity, variable expiratory airflow limitation and airway hyper-responsiveness to a range of stimuli, such as exercise and inhaled irritants. At the population level, a subset of individuals with asthma exhibit an accelerated decline in lung function over their lifetime 2 , which, in severe chronic disease, manifests as fixed airflow obstruction. This decline is especially prominent in late-onset asthma 3 . The origin and severity of asthma are driven by strong genetic and environmental factors. Although most cases of asthma begin in childhood in association with IgE-dependent sensitization to common environmental allergens 4 , asthma can also emerge later in life. Adult-onset asthma often occurs in the absence of allergy but can be accompanied by intolerance to NSAIDs, rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps 5 . Intolerance to NSAIDs most likely results from reduced production of the anti-bronchoconstrictor p rostaglandin E 2 under conditions of inflammation.",

The disease is closely linked to the presence of immediate hypersensitivity, and 50% of children who are diagnosed with asthma by 3 years of age and 80% of those diagnosed by the time they are 6 years of age are atopic -that is, they are genetically predisposed to allergic hypersensitivity 16 . The prevalence of wheezing exceeds the prevalence of asthma in children up to 6 years of age. This observation suggests that factors other than asthma, such as physician diagnostic bias and lower respiratory tract infections, can drive the onset and persistence of wheezing. Asthma is not constant across the lifecourse of the patient, and patients can experience periods of remission and the onset of new asthma 17 . Whereas asthma is more common in boys than girls in early childhood, throughout puberty and early adulthood, boys experience asthma remission at a higher rate than in girls. In addition, girls acquire asthma more often than boys in this age period. Consequently, the sex ratio of asthma during childhood reverses in adolescence and in young adulthood 16, 18, 19 (FIG. 3) . The reasons for this variability in asthma across the lifecourse of the patient are not clear, but evidence is mounting in support of a key role for hormones in this process. Furthermore, asthma remission during adoles cence is associated with lower initial airway hyperresponsiveness and greater gain in the function of small airways compared with asthma that begins after childhood 18 . The reasons for this variability between earlyonset and late-onset asthma are probably complex, but differing environmental exposures (exposome)including those that occur in occupational settings -are thought to be important 20 .",

T2-type inflammation occurs in >80% of children and in the majority of adults with asthma in association with sensitization to environmental allergens, such as those from dust mites, fungi, pets and pollens 24-26 . This sensitization is often associated with other clinical manifestations of atopy such as atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and food allergy. The inflammatory infiltrate that accompanies T helper 2 (T H 2) lymphocyte responses is mainly composed of eosinophils but also includes mast cells, basophils, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages 27 . Cellular activation and release of inflammatory mediators in asthma is evidenced by mast cell degranulation and eosinophil vacuolation. The majority of mucosal mast cells in mild-to-moderate allergic-type asthma are of the T H 2 cell-dependant tryptase-expressing type (MC T ) 28 . In the more intractable forms of asthma, mast cells containing both tryptase and chymase (MC TC ) predominate, which are more dependent on stem cell factor (also known as KIT ligand) for their survival than are MC T cells 29, 30 .",

Effective allergen signalling also requires co-stimulatory interactions between DCs and T cells 38 that take place in local lymphoid collections 39 , resulting in T cell differentiation into T H 2-type T cells. These T H 2-type T cells secrete the pro-allergic cytokines, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which in turn leads to the IgE, mast cell and eosinophilic responses that are characteristic of allergic asthma 40 (FIG. 5) .

The EAR is followed by a late-phase response (LAR) that evolves over 3-12 hours, and is linked to infiltration and activation of leukocytes (especially eosinophils) with further LTC 4 generation, T H 2 cytokine release from mast cells and T cells 46 and an increase in airway responsive ness 47 . Although EAR and LAR have been studied in humans and animal models to dissect the allergic mechanisms of asthma, these two responses are not accompanied by the chronic persistent inflammation that characterizes most cases of asthma. Consequently, EAR and LAR do not provide an adequate mechanistic setting within which to investigate exacerbations other than those triggered by allergen exposure 48 . Although much of the focus in asthma pathophysiology has been on positive drivers of inflammation, the defective resolution of inflammation is emerging as a mechanism that might also be involved in asthma. The failure to adequately downregulate the inflammatory response could result in the prolonged survival of mast cells and eosinophils as a result of the cytokine milieu of the asthmatic airway. In addition, an important new paradigm in asthma pathophysiology is the potential role of lipoxins and resolvins as mediators of the endogenous resolution of inflammation. For instance, lipoxin A 4 can induce apoptosis of eosinophils and decrease the activity of ILC2s and natural killer lymphocytes, and the p roduction of lipoxin A 4 is reduced in asthmatic airways 49 .",

The infant gastrointestinal microbiota develops postnatally and is influenced by factors linked to asthma risk, such as mode of delivery, infant feeding practices, antibiotic exposure and exposure to siblings and pets.

            "text": "Along with a potential involvement of the intestinal microbiota in asthma, there is also increasing recognition that the presence of microorganisms in the respiratory tract, including the upper airways, and the way that the immune system responds to these, is likely to have an effect on respiratory health 95 (FIG. 8) . The presence of bacterial pathogens per se is not necessarily associated with disease risk, suggesting that an effective mechanism must normally operate to protect against trans-epithelial invasion in situations where local homeostasis is disturbed and barrier function is compromised, such as during viral infections. Immune recognition of invading bacteria has the potential to play such a part. For example, longitudinal cohort studies have determined that the development of IgG1 (T1-type immunity) and IgE (T2-type immunity) antibodies against bacterial antigens might limit tissue-damaging inflammatory responses to bacterial invasion across the respiratory epithelium 96 . These data indicate that a delayed postnatal rise in serum titres of IgG1 against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in children with a family history of atopy is associated with increased risk of sensitization to perennial aeroallergens and of persistent asthma at 5 years of age 97,98 . In this context, the likely role of specific IgG1 is to accelerate phagocytic clearance of microorganisms that breach the mucosal barrier, and thus limit potential t issue damage 99 . The presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways is likely to generate a vigorous inflammatory response associated with substantial lower respiratory symptoms, and might result in unbalanced T1-type immunity that increases the risk of developing asthma. T2-type immunity against respiratory mucosal dwelling bacteria such as H. influenzae and S. pneunomiae, detectable as bacterial-specific serum IgE, is present in teenagers regardless of their atopic status. The strength of this immunity is inversely associated with asthma risk 100 . This bacterial-specific IgE is probably a surrogate marker for underlying populations of bacterial-specific T H 2 memory cells that secrete IL-4 and IL-13, which are pluripotent cytokines that probably have a role in Nature Reviews | Disease Primers In response to a combination of signals transmitted by cytokines and direct contact, the DCs and thymic epithelium promote the differentiation of an array of different leukocyte subsets (inner, yellow circle). Before differentiation, these subsets either augment or protect the airways from inflammatory responses linked to asthma, whereas following differentiation, they generate cytokines that promote the development of asthma. These cytokines influence various different cell types and the attendant inflammatory responses to drive allergic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness.

Figure downregulating bacterial-induced macrophage activation and thus limiting local tissue damage 96 . Exaggerated and unbalanced T2-type immunity is also probably associated with the eosinophilic inflammation and tissue damage observed in chronic asthma. Thus, deficiencies in the normal immune recognition of bacterial incursion across the respiratory epithelium, e specially at times of respiratory viral infection that spreads to the lower airways, probably results in an unbalanced immune response that translates into an increased risk of s ubsequently developing asthma.",

            "text": "Airway modelling and remodelling. Although histological evidence of airway inflammation and modelling (or remodelling) in infants and young children with recurrent wheeze or asthma is limited, what l ittle evidence there is suggests that recurrent wheeze is associated with thickening of the epithelial reticular basement membrane and T2-type airway inflammation 101 . These changes relate to symptom severity, the need for antiasthma medication 102 and long-term evidence of airway inflammation 103 . It is noteworthy that thickening of the reticular lamina only begins with the onset of asthma, and in infants this thickening is not a feature of viral wheezing per se 104 . Perplexing questions are how and when the airways smooth muscle bulk increases and what is the relationship of these increases to the development of inflammation. There is evidence in support of the notion that smooth muscle hyperplasia accompanies early-onset childhood asthma 104 . However, studies in older children with asthma, cystic fibrosis or non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis have shown that the increases in smooth muscle mass in these children were similar to those observed in children without a lung disease 105 . This similarity suggests that a proportion of changes in smooth muscle mass might be related to chronic inflammation generally rather than being disease-specific. However, the remarkable hyper-responsive behaviour of asthmatic smooth muscle does suggest that there are highly specific changes in morphology linked with muscle function, such as an increase in the expression of oxidant pathways that changes the behaviour of muscle fibre contractility 106 . Recent data from challenge tests in adults with atopic asthma indicate that bronchoconstriction per se, regardless of the mechanism inducing it, increases the secretion of pro-fibrotic cytokines Figure 6 | Allergen sensitization of the airways during the induction of allergic-type asthma. Infection (bacterial and viral) and pollutants perturb the airway epithelium, which leads to initial danger signalling and activation of innate signalling receptors. This signalling causes airway epithelial cells (ECs) to secrete chemokines and leads to trafficking of immature dendritic cells (DCs) to the mucosal epithelium. These DCs respond to danger signals through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which leads to their maturation into competent antigen-presenting myeloid-type DCs. Allergen detection and processing by these activated DCs is mediated by the extension of cellular processes into the airways or by the capture of allergens that have breached the epithelium. Allergen-loaded DCs then drive T cell differentiation by migrating to local lymph nodes where they interact with naive T cells (T N ) via the T cell receptor (TCR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and co-stimulatory molecules. DC activation and T helper 2 (T H 2) cell maturation and migration into the mucosa are influenced by additional epithelial-derived cytokines and chemokines, including IL-25, IL-33, CC-chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) and CCL22.

Thus, in addition to chronic inflammation and responses to tissue injury, altered mechanotransduction might be a further cause of airway wall remodelling.

Superimposed on this chronicity is the acute worsening of asthma (also termed asthma exacerbation), which is most often driven by common respiratory viruses, allergen exposure and air pollutants. One possible explanation for why the asthmatic airways are so susceptible to usually innocuous viruses such as rhinovirus is that the epithelium, which undergoes repeated damage and repair, also exhibits an impaired innate immune response that involves a reduced capacity for induction of the protective interferons IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb in response to viruses.",

Up to one-third of those who become asthma-free as young adults remain in remission throughout their adult life -that is, they remain symptom-free and have normal lung function in the absence of medication use. However, given that some evidence of airway inflammation remains in these individuals, it is debatable whether their lack of obvious symptoms indicates complete recovery as opposed to signifying clinical remission only 18, 115 . Sensitization to small-particle allergens from animals with fur, especially from cats, is a risk factor for the persistence of asthma into adulthood. These allergens, such as major allergen I polypeptide chain 1 (allergen Fel dI) found in the saliva of cats 116 , can penetrate the small airways. Complete remission from asthma (cure) can also occur, but in this case, airway hyper-responsiveness also resolves 117-119 . Although complete remission of asthma is accompanied by the normalization of lung function, which is usually measured by spirometry as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), the small airways, which are known to contribute to asthma, have not been well studied in this context. In addition, bronchial biopsy studies have revealed that airway remodelling, defined by thickening of the reticular lamina of the epithelial basement membrane, persists in adults who experience complete remission of asthma, and these individuals also show some residual increase in the n umber of eosinophils compared with those who do not have asthma. However, the function of these residual eosinophils is important to note. In contrast to the eosinophils of patients with asthma, those present in individuals in complete remission are neither 'activated' nor are they easily attracted to the airway lumen in the absence of ICSs or by indirect stimuli such as inhaled adenosine 120 . These differences indicate that eosinophil activation and associated mediator secretion, rather than the mere presence of these inflammatory cells, is linked to the p ersistence of asthma.",

In addition, the epithelium no longer undergoes healing by 'primary intention' but instead undergoes 'secondary intention' -a process that involves the production of growth factors that drive remodelling responses in the underlying airway wall. Similarly, the damaged and stimulated epithelium generates growth factors that contribute to goblet cell metaplasia. The augmented communication between the epithelium and the underlying mesenchyme resembles the activation of the epithelium-mesenchymal trophic unit that drives airway morphogenesis in the developing fetal lung. The resulting cytokine milieu also provides a favourable environment for sustaining chronic inflammation. This research was originally published in Consequently, to prevent asthma onset, allergen avoidance is strongly recommended in cases of existing respiratory allergies. However, the role of allergen avoidance in preventing allergic asthma is poor, unless it is undertaken as part of a complex and multifaceted prevention effort 124,125 . The disappointing outcomes of indoor allergen reduction programmes either in pregnancy and early life (referred to as primary prevention) or once asthma is established (termed second ary prevention) are difficult to explain 126-128 . One potential reason for the failure of such efforts is that they might have simultaneously reduced exposure to protective factors, such as microbial products, which shape innate immunity by interacting with pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors 129 . Indeed, microbial products present in indoor environments are protective against allergen sensitization if exposure occurs prenatally or in the first few years of life 130,131 .

Asthma is caused by failure of the respiratory and immune systems to develop normally. This schematic represents asthma risk factors that operate at different stages of life. Asthma risk at birth is influence by genetic predispositions, impaired lung function and delayed immune maturation. Postnatal risk factors that increase asthma risk include reduced lung growth resulting in low lung function, the timing of acquisition of specific components of the pulmonary microbiota, repeated episodes of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) that spread to the lower airway and result in severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), maturational deficiencies in the innate and adaptive immune systems that increase the risk of severe LRTIs and favour primary allergic sensitization and repeated allergen exposure, resulting in persistent airway inflammation. The maternal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota is thought to influence priming of the fetal immune system, and the postnatal development of the infant GIT microbiota is influenced by early-life exposures. Although each individual pathway increases the risk of asthma, the major risk is produced when a child progresses through multiple risk pathways simultaneously. fresh vehicle exhaust pollutants and non-combustionderived particles. These pollutants induce oxidative stress and epithelial damage to initiate or augment airway inflammation 141,142 and reduce inhibitory T Reg function 143 . Although controversial, such pathways are being linked to the initiation of asthma in those who otherwise would not experience the disease, as all of these pathways could contribute to enhanced respiratory sensitization to aeroallergens 144 and increased airway hyper-responsiveness and remodelling 145 . It has even been suggested that prenatal exposure to pollutants might contribute to postnatal asthma 146 . One possible mechanism in which pollutants could induce asthma involves interaction with genetic risk factors such as polymorphisms in antioxidant genes, for instance in those that encode various glutathione S-transferases, and in the TNF promoter 147 .

Obesity during childhood is strongly associated with the incidence and severity of asthma 153 , and maternal obesity and high gestational weight gain are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma, especially in non-asthmatic mothers 154 (FIG. 9) . A combination of mechanical factors and shared causal metabolic, hormonal and low-grade inflammatory pathways might help explain these associations. For instance, the obesity-associated chronic inflammatory response is defined by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1 and IL-6, produced by macrophages and adipokines, such as leptin, chemerin and adiponectin, produced by adipocytes that inhibit cell proliferation and cause tissue damage. Leptin is a sentinel mediator of differentiation of lipofibroblasts and controls pulmonary surfactant synthesis in fetal lungs 155 . In mice, leptin infusion enhances airway hyper-responsiveness, increases the levels of IgE following allergen challenge 156 and increases airway levels of IL-6 (REF. 157) . A low-grade maternal inflammatory response with increased levels of leptin also contributes to postnatal risk of asthma 158 . However, the exact mechanism l inking obesity and asthma still remains to be fully clarified.",

Although symptoms including wheeze, chest tightness and shortness of breath are often considered essential features of asthma in humans, the adage 'all that is asthma does not wheeze and all that wheezes is not asthma' holds true. Epidemiological studies that rely on 'doctor diagnosis' of asthma overestimate the true disease prevalence owing to mis classification 159 . A diagnosis of asthma usually begins when a child or adult presents with a range of spontaneous respiratory symptoms including recurrent cough and nocturnal awakening, along with symptoms triggered by external stimuli, such as allergens, viral infections, exercise and cold air. In adults, a history of asthma or recurrent 'bronchitic episodes' in childhood holds an important clue to diagnosis. However, a diagnosis of asthma should not be made on clinical characteristics alone. The definition of asthma requires a combination of appropriate clinical symptoms in association with documented reversible airflow limitation and/or airway hyper-responsiveness 160 . Although reversibility of airway obstruction and hyper-responsiveness are considered hallmarks of asthma, the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnositic criteria to identify these symptoms are poorly defined. Guidelines have added the important extra dimension of airway inflammation to the diagnosis of asthma, which is measured by eosinophil counts in sputum or blood and/or increased fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) 161, 162 .",

Patients should be tested on a spirometer that is equipped with population normal values and, ideally, one that generates a flow-volume loop that can be evaluated for both inspiratory and expiratory effort. FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC) and the FEV1/FVC ratio should be reported alongside reversibility of lung function with an inhaled SABA. Symptomatic asthma is often associated with a predicted FEV1 of <80% and an ageadjusted FEV1/FVC of <75%. Testing should be repeated after inhalation of a SABA to establish reversibility of airway obstruction, a hallmark of asthma, although as noted, both bronchodilator reversibility and peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability have poor sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of asthma. By convention, a diagnosis of asthma requires at least a 12% improvement in FEV1 over baseline and a total improvement of at least 200 ml. As asthma is frequently highly variable, normal spirometry results do not exclude the disease. Additional diagnostic aids include repeat testing over time and diurnal PEF monitoring using a portable PEF meter. If spirometry results remain normal, bronchial provocation testing with inhaled methacholine or manni tol should be considered to establish if airway hyper-responsiveness exists as another characteristic feature of asthma, although some variability in responses can be seen. To perform this test, the patient inhales increasing concentrations of the challenge substance until there is a \u226520% fall in the FEV1 from the saline control value. Each challenge agent has a threshold concentration for the fall that identifies asthma. Exercise testing or, as an alternative, eucapnic hyperventilation, which mimics the volume of air exchanged during exercise, is another method for uncovering hyper-responsiveness and is especially useful in diagnosing asthma in children.",

If diagnosis is still questionable, then a practical approach is to treat the patient with medications that are appropriate to their level of severity defined by national or international asthma guidelines. If the patient's symptoms become markedly better in response to this treatment, then asthma is the likely cause. Possible other causes of wheezing and asthmalike symptoms should always be considered in the face of a poor response to a trial of treatment, and can include COPD, upper airway obstruction and laryngospasm in adults and viral-associated infection in children.",

Perhaps the most crucial use of these biomarkers will be to identify various molecular phenotypes of asthma, in particular severe asthma, where biologic agents are likely to be targeted. To date, the biomarkers identified are all linked to T2-type inflammatory phenotypes, which might either predict or be responsive to these T2-type-targeted therapies. Blood eosinophil counts of ~150 per microlitre seem to both predict responses to IL-5-targeted therapies and fall in response to these treatments 181 . At present, it is unclear which biomarker will best predict response to IL-4-IL-13 pathwaytargeted therapies, as all have shown some predictive ability. However, for IL-4-IL-13 pathway-targeted therapies, whereas blood eosinophil counts predict response, these counts do not decline in response to therapy 164,173 . It remains unclear whether any current biomarker, alone or in combination with a second or third biomarker, will identify patients who respond better to IL-5-specific as compared with IL-4-IL-13 pathway-specific or IgEspecific approaches. These biomarkers are linked closely to disease pathways, with less relation to treatment responses. As such, their inhibition by specific targeted biologic approaches and use to produce improved clinically meaningful outcomes might eventually translate what are currently molecular phenotypes into endotypes -which are definitively defined biological processes that underlie particular subgroups of the disease.",

In individual patient samples, T H 2-high and T H 17-high patterns were mutually exclusive and their gene signatures were inversely correlated and differentially regulated by IL-13 and IL-17A.

Sources of exposure include certain allergy-protective and asthma-protective lifestyle conditions, such as traditional farms that contain environmental microorganisms -for example, high levels of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and of fungi 193 -and biodiverse environments found, for example, in rural areas. By contrast, urbanization is associated with both low biodiversity and an increase in the prevalence of asthma. Although epidemiological and experimental studies strongly support the concept that a decrease in exposure to diverse microorganisms causes increases in asthma prevalence 89, 132 , this now needs to be translated into a clinical application for asthma prevention. Interventions that have aroused recent interest are the use of probiotics, which are live bacteria found in foods such as yoghurt or taken as supplements, and prebiotics, which are specialized plant fibres that promote the growth of 'good bacteria' already resident in the colon, especially in those living in rural environments with livestock farming. There have been a range of studies in which the gut microbiota has been changed by probiotics or prebiotics. For instance, prenatal and postnatal administration of certain probiotics decreases the risk of allergen sensitization 194 . However, although there have been claims there are some benefits of using probiotics to prevent atopic dermatitis 195 , results in asthma prevention have so far been disappointing 196, 197 .",

Asthma guidelines such as those provided by GINA 1 , the US National Asthma Education and Prevention Program 205 and the British Thoracic Society 206 classify asthma by severity and extent of disease control. This classification is done in 4 or 5 steps that are used to assess the use of controller drugs, such as inhaled ICSs, LABAs, LTRAs and, for the most severe disease, the IgE-specific monoclonal antibody omalizumab (FIG. 11) . By starting ICSs as early as step 1 of the management plan and scaling controller therapy up in a stepwise manner, dependency on inhaled SABAs for symptom relief has been reduced, exacerbations prevented, asthma-related mortality reduced and QOL improved in the majority of patients with asthma. Combination ICS-LABA therapy in moderate-to-severe asthma has achieved considerable success, as has omalizumab in severe allergic asthma. Moreover, maintenance and rescue therapy with the combination of ICS and the rapidly acting LABA formoterol has shown beneficial effects when used as maintenance and reliever treatment in adult patients with asthma 207 . In those patients who remain symptomatic despite taking an ICS-LABA combination, adding a long-acting anti-muscarinic antagonist is beneficial 208 . Inhaled drugs are most frequently used on demand or twice daily. Novel ultra-long-acting bronchodilators have been developed to be used once daily 209 but their effectiveness is yet to be fully evaluated.",

Despite extensive research, the underlying pathobiology of severe asthma has not been established. Nonetheless the aetiology of severe asthma is likely to be heterogeneous rather than based on a single unifying process (FIG. 1) . As a result of increased awareness of this heterogeneity, the identification of appropriate biomarkers in individual patients with asthma is becoming crucial in guiding the use of therapies that target the specific causative pathways or endotypes of asthma [217] [218] [219] [220] . Individual T2-type cytokine biologics that target the IL-4-IL-13, IL-5 and TSLP pathways and IgE itself are promising treatment options for severe disease, especially when used with biomarkers such as sputum and blood eosinophil numbers, FeNO, serum periostin levels and total IgE levels to differentiate 'responders' from 'non-responders' . Blockade of a single pathway has clear clinical benefits and few associated adverse effects. However, whereas this strategy leads to improvement in some asthma outcomes, such as a reduction in asthma exacerbations produced with IL-5-specific therapy, outcomes for other measures, such as lung function and hyper-responsiveness, are less favourable. As a result, single pathway blockade has only partial efficacy 169 . Additional research is needed to define how such agents should be used in a stratified or personalized approach to management.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends that asthma is classified and treated according to 5 steps that reflect symptom severity and patient characteristics. The relative widths of each step reflect the number of patients who receive each treatment. In particular, dose-response studies demonstrate that the majority of patients with asthma should be able to be treated with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs; step 2). The relative heights of each step reflect disease severity, with treatment in step 5 reserved for those with the most severe disease. *For children 6-11 years of age, theophylline is not recommended and the preferred step 3 treatment with is medium-dose ICSs. \u2021 Tiotropium by soft-mist inhaler is indicated as add-on treatment for patients with a history of exacerbations; it is not indicated in patients <18 years of age. \u00a7 contribute to treatment responsiveness. The proportion of phenotypic variability accounted for by genetic variation (heritability) is estimated to be 28.5% for bronchodilator responsiveness and 50% for lung function 221 . For example, the Arg16 allele of the gene encoding the \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor has been shown to associate with worsening of asthma when children with the disease receive continuous SABA or LABA monotherapy 222, 223 . This and other variants of the \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor have different effects on the disease in different ethnic populations 224 . Polymorphisms also influence responsiveness to ICSs and LTRAs and deserve further study 225 . Bronchial thermoplasty, delivered by the Alair \u2122 System, is a treatment for severe asthma that was approved by the US FDA in 2010. This treatment involves the delivery of controlled, therapeutic radio frequency energy to the airway wall to heat the tissue and thereby reduce the amount of smooth muscle in the airway wall 226 . This procedure causes epithelial injury followed by regeneration of the epithelium, blood vessels, mucosa and nerves but not airway smooth muscle 227, 228 . Indeed, there is preliminary evidence that this procedure is able to reduce airway smooth muscle mass in patients with severe asthma 228 . Although bronchial thermoplasty is an exciting development for managing some types of severe asthma, its place in management guidelines is still being evaluated 229, 230 .",

As outlined earlier, although most severe childhood asthma starts early in life, the majority of infants and young children who have wheezing episodes do not progress to persistent asthma 237 . A further problem arises with the apparent lack of clinical or physiological response to bronchodilators in infants and young children with established asthma-related risk factors that predict long-term outcomes 238 . The aim of asthma management at all ages is to achieve good clinical control for as long as possible. Young children with persistent symptoms should be managed in a similar manner to that of older children with persistent symptoms. As pointed out in the GINA guidelines, for children \u22645 years of age 1,169 , a combination of increased daytime cough, daytime wheeze and night-time use of an inhaled SABA is a strong predictor of acute exacerbations in these children. Inhaled medications are the cornerstone of asthma management in younger children; however, substantial importance must be placed on the ability of the child to use the inhalation device. The use of ICSs as first-line management for children with persistent symptoms is supported by placebo-controlled clinical trials 239 . In contrast with adults, there is no evidence for the use of combination ICS-LABA therapy in this age group, with the GINA guidelines specifically advising against this in children \u22645 years of age.",

Thus, treatment of asthma is primarily focused on improving the day-to-day symptoms of the patient, preventing exacerbations and generally improving their QOL (FIG. 12) . Indeed, GINA 1 identifies asthma control as the main outcome of asthma management. Asthma control incorporates level of symptoms, number and severity of exacerbations, as well as lung function. The effect of these factors on patients' activities and daily living is generally referred to as a patient's QOL. To address this more holistic approach, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs; defined in BOX 2) are becoming more attractive in the assessment of treatment success. These are typically short, self-completed questionnaires, most commonly used to measure the health status or healthrelated QOL of a patient before and after an intervention. The concept that PROMs are necessary to assess the impact of asthma treatment has contributed to their increasing use in clinical practice 243, 244 . The PROMs generally used for the assessment of asthma are the asthma QOL questionnaire (AQLQ), the paediatric version of the AQLQ (PAQLQ), the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) 245 . The ACT and ACQ focus on symptoms and functional status rather than how these affect the patient's personal perceptions of the effect of asthma on their day-to-day QOL. However, these outcomes are intimately related as studies show strong correlations between the level of asthma control and QOL, even when controlling for disease severity 246 . QOL in patients with asthma is likely to be affected by various factors and co-morbidities associated with asthma, including asthma control (even when controlling for asthma severity), duration of disease and the concurrent need for chronic therapies, frequent exacerbations, obesity or weight gain and psychosocial factors 241, 247, 248 . In addition, sex and socioeconomic factors, as well as co-morbidities such as gastro-oesophageal reflux and rhino inusitis also probably have a role in determining QOL in patients with asthma. These co-morbidities are particularly prevalent in more-severe asthma 6 . Patients with more-severe asthma experience an increase in symptom severity, more frequent and severe exacerbations and more co-morbidity, all of which c ontribute to an overall poor QOL.",

Interestingly, not all therapies affect these parameters in the same manner. For instance, although IgE-specific treatment improves exacerbations in patients with more-severe asthma, the mean improvement in QOL as measured by the AQLQ, while substantial, does not achieve the 0.5 points threshold change for clinical significance on the 7-point scale of this questionnaire 249 . The intensity of the intervention also seems to influence the magnitude of improvement in the AQLQ. This improvement is demonstrated by the invasive treatment bronchial thermoplasty; however, the difference in improvement between active and sham thermoplasty also did not achieve clinical significance 250 . Finally, it should be recognized that the mere label of asthma as a chronic disease, with lifelong required treatment and daily confrontation with the disease, even though controlled to some extent, might affect the QOL of an individ ual with asthma consider ably, irrespective of disease severity 251 .

However, the prevention of asthma in at-risk infants and cure of the fully developed disease seem distant goals. All of our current therapies are still based on damping down airway inflammation and on relieving airway obstruction. To make further progress and recognizing that the majority of the disease begins early in life, we need to understand what the genetic, prenatal, maternal and early-life environmental factors are that initiate asthma or at least render particular infants more susceptible to it. A most promising field connecting these two drivers is the uncovering of gene functions by environmental exposures through epigenetics. There are already novel data about the relationship of the epigenome to maternal smoking; similar epigenetic studies looking at the plethora of chemicals that humans are now exposed to, such as air pollutants and endocrine disruptors, as well as diet might cast new light on preterm susceptibility. In terms of established asthma and disease severity, novel mechanisms are emerging to explain the way that cells adapt to environmental cues. These mechanisms include changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and regulation of transcription and translation by non-coding RNAs and, when coupled with recent advances in lung delivery of oligonucleotides and small molecules, are opening up new opportunities for intervention 219, 252 .",

This has implications for lung development in utero and its association with large and small airway dysfunction and hyperresponsiveness that might already be p resent at birth in those likely to develop asthma. As the majority of asthma cases, at least in childhood, adopt a T2-type immune pattern, a key question is what drives the develop ment of this immunological pathway as opposed to o thers. Adaptive immunity is just that. It has to be initi ated by some other event (or events). Where does the initial defect (or defects) lie? Have we overemphasized altered immunity towards the allergic phenotype at the expense of abnormalities of the airway structural cells, such as epithelial cells, fibroblasts, nerves, microvasculature and smooth muscle, along with the modelling or remodelling components? Given that these airway components of adult asthma increase in response to mechano transductive as well as inflammatory stimuli, is it possible that repeated wheeze in infancy can similarly initiate asthma in susceptible individuals? Bronchial thermoplasty is an example of a disruptive technology that looks promising but needs further study to identify which patients benefit most from this invasive intervention. There is early evidence that this procedure targets smooth muscle, possibly suggesting that to overcome asthma more attention needs to be given to influencing modelling or remodelling pathways as well as halting inflammation. A crucial question that still needs answering is whether there is a mutual interdependency of airway inflammation (T2 type) and the onset of smooth muscle and other remodelling characteristics of asthma. If so, how and when does this occur? If interventions were able to alter the airway structural components (the 'soil') in which the T2-type inflammatory response (the 'seed') takes hold at the initiation of asthma, would we stand a better chance of preventing or even curin g established disease?",

Low lung function at birth is a primary risk factor for asthma and, therefore, research into the causes of this both at birth and in early life is needed to uncover potentially modi fiable exposures. Understanding the heterogeneity of severe asthma and using modern biomarker and statistical tools are opening up the field into asthma subtypes. This is a key focus of current research as differing causal pathways (endotypes) might be involved in different subtypes of asthma. New diagnostic tests to identify these subtypes and specific treatments, especially biologics, which target particular pathways represent new directions for asthma research where the focus is on identifying treatable disease traits. Thus, the proliferation of biologics now being trialled in severe asthma, although at present these only target components of the T2-type pathway (including IgE, IL-4, IL-13, IL-5 and TSLP), herald a new era in highly targeted, pathway-directed therapy that will require companion diagnostics to make them cost effective. Progress is also being made on the diagnostics front, with sputum and blood eosinophil counts, FeNO and l evels of IgE and serum periostin all emerging as candidates. It now seems crucial that, even with current biomarkers, great attempts are made to place inflammation at the forefront of asthma diagnosis and management as a treatable trait that complements PROMs, symptoms and lung function. Implementation research is required to embed such a change so that laboratories and practices routinely offer such tests. Targeted therapy will increase in use as new causative endotypes are discovered, but even with current anti-inflammatory therapy (ICSs and LTRAs), biomarker monitoring needs to become an i ntegral part of assessing the patients' treatment response.",

Nuocytes represent a new innate effector leukocyte that mediates type-2 immunity. Nature 464, 1367-1370 (2010). This important publication shows that nuocyte (ILC2) numbers expand in vivo in response to the T2-type-inducing cytokines IL-25 and IL-33, and represent the predominant early source of IL-13 during helminth infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. In the combined absence of IL-25 and IL-33 signalling, nuocytes fail to expand, resulting in a severe defect in worm expulsion that is rescued by the adoptive transfer of in vitro-cultured wild-type, but not IL-13-deficient, nuocytes. 36.

The authors suggest that a greater understanding of the effects of protease allergens on airway inflammation and on the relevant targets could define novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of allergic asthma. 42.

Epithelial-mesenchymal communication in the pathogenesis of chronic asthma. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 1, 93-98 (2004). This review proposes the hypothesis that epithelial damage in patients with asthma initiates aberrant communication, mediated by growth factors, between the epithelium and the underlying myofibroblast sheath to drive airway remodelling, which is termed activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit. 58.
