Recently, gastrointestinal shedding of viral RNA detected in fecal samples has been reported in both children and adults [1, 2]. This may be unsurprising given the high expression of viral host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in gastrointestinal tract [3]. In a clinical study of 138 COVID-19 patients, Wang et al. reported that 10% experienced gastrointestinal symptoms 1\u20132 days prior the onset of fever and dyspnea [4]. Therefore, we aim here to explore whether or not patients presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, or diarrhea may be at increased odds of the severe form of COVID-19.",

Articles in Chinese were screened by a healthcare professional fluent in both Chinese and English.

As the data set was limited and included case series, no study risk of bias or publication bias assessment was performed.",

Two additional studies could be identified from the reference list of selected articles. Thus, the pooled analysis finally included 10 studies, with a total sample of 1989 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 598 of which (30.1%) were classified as having severe disease [4\u201313]. All studies reported data as symptoms at onset or admission, except for two studies in which timing of symptoms was unclear [8, 11].",
