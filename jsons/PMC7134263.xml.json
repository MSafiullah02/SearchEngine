It plays an important function in economic development and it is an essential source of livelihood. Agriculture is also a crucial origin of environmental downgrading, adding to climate variation, decreasing freshwater resources, detracting soil fertility and contaminating the environment over fertilizer and pesticide [1, 2]. Essentially, food production relies on the lofty natural resources it is derogating. Sfs therefore not only requires that all people always have access to sufficient and nutritious food, but food be formed with minimal environmental brunt. Hence, sustainable agricultural development desires that agriculture face the demands of the present without negotiating the capability of future generations to tourney their own demands [3]. Achieving these goals by current Agriculture practices has not been very successful. Today, Agriculture is not only a dominating factor of environmental degradation, it is a major force compelling the Earth System beyond the \u2018safe-operating space\u2019 for humanity [4, 5].",

In [23] the impact of proliferation of ICTs was investigated, due to the growth of mobile technologies, in order to know if it has actually had any significant impact on Agriculture. It was confirmed that ICTs play a significant role in enhancing agricultural production. Study [24] presented a research that assessed the traits, diversity and impacts of ICTs used in African agriculture. The key challenges hindering more widespread use of the technologies were also highlighted by the author. The study in [24], vividly reveals that ICTs are making impact in increasing productivity and marketing of products but there are still several constraints for adequate utilization by the farmers. Hence, there is likelihood that combination of mobile technologies with other ICT platforms such as mass media, will have exponential impact on agriculture. Study in [25] on the influence of ICT in agriculture, (in developing countries), in respect of opportunities and challenges, found that one of the major benefits of ICT in agricultural sector is the improvement of market activities.",

However, the loss of adequate provision of ORF [18] and, above all, its higher price is often a strong obstacle to the purchase of ORF. Also, the inadequacy of information on the meaning of ORF [26], coupled with diverse of ways to label organic products has affected the purchasing power of organic products. Despite the fact that organic farming looks quite comforting for consumers, the response of farmers to the concept is not at an alarming rate. Only a minority of farmers, especially in dairy areas, are in favour of organic farming.",
