As history has shown, Dirac's canonical quantization method works reasonably well in the case of conventional quantum mechanics over R n but it may fail in non-trivial phase spaces and also suffer from ordering problem. Affine quantization is an alternative method, similar to the canonical quantization, that may offer a positive result in situations for which canonical quantization fails. In this paper we revisit the affine quantization method on the half line. We formulate and solve some simple models, the free particle and the harmonic oscillator.",

The following simple technique for quantizing a classical system is used. Let q i , p i , i = 1, 2 . . . n, be the canonical positions and momenta for a classical system with n degrees of freedom.

The second view would be to regard it as provisional and seek to find a quantization formulation that eliminates this apparently unphysical feature of the current approaches. The aim of eliminating the dependence on cartesian coodinates in the standard approaches is no doubt one of the motivations for several methods such as the geometric quantization [7, 8, 9, 10] , the path integral quantization [11] , the deformation quantization [8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] , the Klauder-Berezin-Toeplitz quantization [17, 18, 19, 20] .

Our motivation is due to the fact that there is a difficulty with canonical quantization when it comes to configuration spaces other then R n . Consider, for example, a particle that is restricted to move on the positive real line. The configuration space is Q = R + . It seems reasonable to use the position q and momentum p as classical observables, which satisfy the usual commutations relations. However, when we try to represent these by operatorsq = q and p = \u2212i \u2202 \u2202q , it turns out that the momentum operatorp is not self-adjoint on the Hilbert space H = L 2 (R + , dq). Thus a straightforward application of Dirac's canonical quantization recipe is impossible.",

In fact, family of quantum Hamiltonians known as spiked harmonic oscillators is given by the general Hamiltonian operator H = \u2212d 2 /dx 2 + x 2 + \u03b1/x 2 acting on the Hilbert space L 2 (0, \u221e). The name of the operator derives from the graphical shape of the full potential V (x) = x 2 + \u03b1/x 2 which shows a pronounced peak near the origin for \u03b1 > 0. The spiked harmonic oscillatos has drawn the attention of many authors because it represents the simplest model of certain realistic interaction potentials in atomic, molecular and nuclear physics, and second and also due to its interesting intrinsic properties from the viewpoint of mathematical physics [34, 35] .",
