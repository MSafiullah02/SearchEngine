            "text": "Background: Serum procalcitonin levels have been used as a biomarker of invasive bacterial infection and recently have been advocated to guide antibiotic therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, rigorous studies correlating procalcitonin levels with microbiologic data are lacking. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) have been linked to viral and bacterial infection as well as noninfectious causes. Therefore, we evaluated procalcitonin as a predictor of viral versus bacterial infection in patients hospitalized with AECOPD with and without evidence of pneumonia. Methods: Adults hospitalized during the winter with symptoms consistent with AECOPD underwent extensive testing for viral, bacterial, and atypical pathogens. Serum procalcitonin levels were measured on day 1 (admission), day 2, and at one month. Clinical and laboratory features of subjects with viral and bacterial diagnoses were compared. Results: In total, 224 subjects with COPD were admitted for 240 respiratory illnesses. Of these, 56 had pneumonia and 184 had AECOPD alone. A microbiologic diagnosis was made in 76 (56%) of 134 illnesses with reliable bacteriology (26 viral infection, 29 bacterial infection, and 21 mixed viral bacterial infection). Mean procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in patients with pneumonia compared with AECOPD. However, discrimination between viral and bacterial infection using a 0.25 ng/mL threshold for bacterial infection in patients with AECOPD was poor. Conclusion: Procalcitonin is useful in COPD patients for alerting clinicians to invasive bacterial infections such as pneumonia but it does not distinguish bacterial from viral and noninfectious causes of AECOPD.",

            "text": "Guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) recommend antibiotics for the treatment of moderate to severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). 1 Several meta-analyses support these recommendations to reduce mortality and treatment failures. 2 Although purulent sputum and growth of a bacterial pathogen suggest infection, definitive causality with an AECOPD is difficult because patients may be chronically colonized. 3, 4 In addition, recent studies using molecular diagnostics indicate that a substantial proportion of AECOPD are associated with viral infection. 5, 6 Accurate methods to differentiate viral and bacterial respiratory infections to allow targeted antibiotic therapy would be beneficial. Measurement of serum procalcitonin has been proposed to discriminate bacterial infection from viral or noninfectious causes. 7 Procalcitonin is a calcitonin precursor that is normally produced in neuroendocrine cells of the thyroid and lungs. However, in response to bacterial infections, procalcitonin is produced by cells throughout the body. 8, 9 Stimuli of procalcitonin include bacterial products, including endotoxin and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, whereas procalcitonin is attenuated by viralinduced interferon-\u03b3. 8 , 10 Procalcitonin testing has been used successfully as a guide to predict serious bacterial infections and medical outcomes in patients with sepsis. 11, 12 Recently, procalcitonin has been assessed as a guide to antibiotic therapy in patients with respiratory illnesses, including COPD. 7, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] However, microbiologic assessment to prove the presence or absence of bacterial infection was not performed in the majority of subjects in most trials, which is a concern for the Food and Drug Administration and Infectious Disease Society of America, as noted in a recent workshop. 19 Therefore, we examined the utility of serum procalcitonin levels as predictors of viral and bacterial infection in patients hospitalized with AECOPD using rigorous viral and bacteriologic studies.",

A subset of subjects with a past medical history of COPD and smoking and symptoms consistent with AECOPD according to the GOLD criteria (increased dyspnea, cough, and/or increased sputum volume or purulence) were identified for the present analysis. Confirmation of COPD was sought as available in the hospital medical records. Patients were screened within 24 hours of admission and those given antibiotics prior to admission, or who had immunosuppression, cavitating lung disease, or witnessed aspiration were excluded. 20 In addition, subjects with other conditions known to increase serum procalcitonin levels (burns, trauma, pancreatitis, renal failure, thyroid tumors) were excluded from the study. Subjects or legal guardians provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the University of Rochester and Rochester General Hospital institutional review boards.",

Recently, use of procalcitonin to guide clinical decisions has been shown to reduce antibiotic use significantly in patients with respiratory illnesses without compromising composite patient outcomes in a number of randomized interventional trials. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 29 Although procalcitonin-guided decisions have been promulgated as a method to \"rule out\" bacterial infection, the 0.25 ng/mL threshold for recommending antibiotic treatment is not based on microbiologic data. Recovery without antibiotics or with an abbreviated course has been equated with the absence of a bacterial infection. The lack of microbiologic correlation with procalcitonin levels is likely to slow endorsement of procalcitonin-guided management in respiratory illness. 19, 30, 31 Ours is the first study in the US to examine the utility of procalcitonin levels in patients with COPD, and consistent with the European literature, we found that a high procalcitonin level was relatively specific for invasive bacterial disease such as pneumonia. 32, 33 In addition, elevated procalcitonin values in the AECOPD group correlated with higher temperature, white blood cells, and more severe illness, suggesting the possibility of occult pneumonia. Thus, high procalcitonin values may alert clinicians to the presence of bacterial pneumonia when the chest radiograph results are negative or ambiguous.",

It has been estimated that approximately 40%-50% of AECOPD cases are due to bacterial infections. 34 The precise contribution of bacterial infection is difficult to define because the airways of COPD patients may be chronically colonized. 3, 4 Acquisition of new strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, rather than bacterial load, appears to be the most important factor in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbations. 35 This factor has not been accounted for in AECOPD antibiotic trials and might explain the modest beneficial effects of antimicrobial treatments observed. We accept that some subjects who were classified as having bacterial infection in our study were colonized rather than infected. However, only 17% of patients overall with AECOPD and without pneumonia, and only 25% of those with evidence of bacterial infection had procalcitonin levels $0.25 ng/mL. While it is possible that this small subgroup represents those who will actually benefit from antibiotic treatment, such a conclusion is premature. Notably, of those with procalcitonin levels ,0.25 ng/mL, 57% had three Anthonisen criteria, suggesting they would benefit from antibiotic treatment based on past studies. 36 Thus, only two conclusions are possible, ie, either the contribution of bacterial infection in AECOPD has been markedly overestimated or procalcitonin values do not differentiate bacterial bronchitis from viral or noninfectious etiologies.",

In a study by Daniels et al, procalcitonin levels were measured in outpatients enrolled in a trial of doxycycline for AECOPD. 37 A significant benefit of doxycycline was noted for patients with procalcitonin levels ,0.1 ng/mL. In this study, as well as in two additional reports, no differences in procalcitonin levels were noted in patients with or without bacteria in sputum during exacerbation. 32, 37, 38 Our study provides the most rigorous microbiologic analysis of moderate to severe illness requiring hospitalization to date, particularly for subjects who were deemed negative for bacterial infection. Unlike prior studies, we did not consider patients to be free of bacterial infection unless adequate samples were taken in a timely fashion and without antibiotic use prior to hospitalization.",

Procalcitonin values decreased signif icantly in both groups at the convalescent time point. Using published procalcitonin thresholds of $0.25 ng/mL as indicative of possible, and $0.5 ng/mL as probable bacterial infection, 59% of pneumonia patients would have been classified as possible and 48% as probable bacterial infection using the maximum procalcitonin on either the day 1 or day 2 measurement.15,16 Because empiric antibiotics are recommended for all patients with pneumonia, further analyses were restricted to those with AECOPD only. In contrast with subjects with radiographic evidence of pneumonia, only 31 of 184 (17%) in the AECOPD group had procalcitonin values $0.25 ng/mL.",
