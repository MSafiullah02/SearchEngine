It is important to realize that the epidemics of COVID-19 have initially happened in well-developed countries that have achieved the so-called health transition. However, the virus does not differentiate between rich-poor or rural-urban dichotomies. It is particularly a threat to a country like India, where 65-68% of the population live in rural areas that also have the highest overall burden of disease globally 1 .",

There is currently a shortfall in health facilities: 18% at the Sub-Centre level, 22% at the PHC level and 30% at the CHC level (as of March 2018) 2 . Although the number of facilities has increased over the years, the workforce availability is substantially below the recommended levels as suggested by the World Health Organization. Rural India has 3.2 government hospital beds per 10,000 people 3 . Many states have a significantly lower number of rural beds than the national average. The state of Uttar Pradesh has 2.5 beds per 10,000 people in rural areas, whilst Rajasthan and Jharkhand have 2.4 and 2.3, respectively 4 . Maharashtra, which has seen the largest number of COVID-19 cases, has 2.0 beds per 10,000 population and Bihar is at 0.6 beds per 10,000. Overall, there is a shortage of specialists working at the CHC level (81.9%). This includes a shortage of surgeons (84.6%), obstetricians & gynaecologists (74.7%), physicians (85.7%) and paediatricians (82.6%) 5 .",

Despite the National Health Mission and Government's commitment, adequate and affordable healthcare is still a mirage. The healthcare system in rural India faces a chronic shortage of medical professionals which is detrimental to the rural health system in terms of the quality and availability of care for rural people. The State focus has been on curative care, whereas poor infrastructure and poor coordination between the line departments makes it difficult to tackle public health emergencies such as COVID-19. The health care system is not adequate or prepared to contain COVID19 transmission in the rural areas, especially in many north Indian states because of the shortage of doctors, hospital beds and equipment, especially in densely populated underserved states 7 . We have failed to manage tragic medical emergencies in the past, such as the unfortunate death of over 150 children in Muzzafarpur in Bihar triggered by malnourishment. Public health challenges, including elimination of persisting communicable diseases like Tuberculosis and ensuring equitable health care, add to the challenges ahead, with the emergence of new pandemics.",

The outbreak can head either way. COVID-19 creates a special challenge considering the poor testing services, surveillance system and above all poor medical care including shortages that were mentioned earlier. The lack of full understanding of the pathogen and the realization that there is no effective cure has played an important role in determining government strategies and this is evident when official actions are examined. The preventive strategy adopted in relation to COVID-19 does not appear to be very innovative. It follows the strategy devised by John Haygarth's 18th-century 'rules of prevention' 8 for eradicating smallpox based on three principles: find every case, isolate the infected individual, and immunise all their contacts. Except in the case of COVID-19, immunisation is not yet available nor any drugs. However, the strategy has evolved further from a focus on individual patients and their contacts to the entire population. The shutdown and complete ban of normal activities for ordinary people seeks to stop community spread. But the obvious question is for how long? It is assumed that the spread of COVID-19 virus can be controlled by these actions. At the moment, these are only assumptions partly based on the experience of earlier outbreaks especially SARS or Ebola epidemics.\"",

What could be important from a public health point of view is its impact on employment of millions of people in the rural areas who are migrant workers in many cities and educational opportunities. The emotional impacts of the strategies may add to this. The people are walking back to their villages in groups covering 500-1000 kilometers after losing their jobs in the cities which is alarming and may exacerbate the problem as the chance of community transmission widens further. Apart from the economic suffering of the already famished society, this could disseminate or spread the disease in rural areas. We do not know about their exposure and status of infection of these population. It is a serious concern because if even one percent of them are infected, we will not be able to control the spread of the epidemic due to the resource limitations, poor health services in rural areas and other factors mentioned above.",

Despite these challenges, the government can take a three-pronged approach to stop the epidemic. These are to invest and prepare healthcare providers in rural areas for the epidemic; massive education programme to educate people; and to create a strong surveillance system that can help in reducing the spread and fatality. Besides, most health care providers in rural areas are unregistered and untrained and do not know what to do in such an emergency. Hence providing clinical guidelines, training and handholding may help.",
