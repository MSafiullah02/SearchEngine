Often, as in the case of covid\u201019, there is little likelihood of developing a vaccine or antiviral within a year of the emergence of such a devastating infection. Utilizing or developing more generic antivirals is a significant challenge, given that viruses can vary considerably as to the their effects, including on the immune system. For example, a general antiviral requirement for influenza and covid\u201019 would be for a treatment that limits the initial innate immune\u2010associated \u201ccytokine storm\u201d where evident, while also acting to increase the efficacy of the adaptive immune response.\n2\n However, for the Ebola virus, such initial dampening of the innate immune response is not so clinically relevant. Allowing for such variability in virus effects, melatonin has emerged as a top candidate for protection against an array of different viruses, including the coronavirus.3, 4, 5 This would seem to arise from the close evolution of melatonin within the emerging mitochondria in the first single\u2010cellular organsims, allowing melatonin to be intimately associated with mitochondrial function, and thereby with immune system regulation.\n6\n The interactions of our \u201cbacterial\u2010driven\u201d coexistence with viruses have provided a \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d from which plant and animal evolution have emerged, and in which evolution has acted to tolerate and limit rather than annihilate. Melatonin is an important aspect of our interactions with viruses.",

At the time of writing, data from China and Italy indicate that the elderly are at far higher risk of covid\u201019 linked mortality, primarily as a consequence of ageing\u2010associated conditions, such as cardiovascular, pulmonary, and diabetic disorders as well as in immune\u2010compromised conditions. Melatonin has clinical utility in all of these health conditions, suggesting its utility in buffering against covid\u201019 interactions with these medical conditions. However, the interactions of the melatonergic pathway with viruses may be more complex than ameliorative effects on ageing\u2010associated preexisting medical conditions. First, the melatonergic pathway is reviewed and how this pathway may interact with the effects of the influenza, covid\u201019, and other viruses. This has treatment implications as well as providing indications as to important future research on how an understanding of human physiological systems can provide treatment targets that regulate the impact of viral infections, including influenza, and covid\u201019 driven pathophysiology.",

Bmal1 inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), leading to the disinhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC drives the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl\u2010coenzyme A (acetyl\u2010CoA) in mitochondria, thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and ATP production. Acetyl\u2010CoA is also a necessary co\u2010substrate for AANAT, and therefore allows pineal melatonin via the Bmal1\u2010PDK\u2010PDC path to increase the activation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway. For this to happen, AANAT needs to be stabilized by 14\u20103\u20103 protein, which is present within the mitochondrial matrix.16, 17 It has been proposed that AANAT may also be stabilized by the mitochondrial ionic channel (LETM1), which has a 14\u20103\u20103\u2010like motif in its C\u2010terminal within the mitochondrial matrix.\n18\n\n",

            "text": "The pineal melatonin/mitochondrial melatonin path may be most important in immune cells, although relevant in all cells subject to circadian regulation by pineal melatonin. The daytime activation of immune cells is associated with glycolytic metabolism, which pineal melatonin resets to OXPHOS, thereby inducing more quiescent immune cell phenotyes. It is by such processes that immune cells are \u201cdampened\u201d at night. However, in the presence of indicants of required immune\u2010inflammatory activity at night, proinflammatory cytokines can \u201cswitch off\u201d pineal melatonin production, thereby forming another branch of the immune\u2010pineal axis.\n19\n As such, the circadian rhythm, as driven by pineal melatonin, is a powerful immune regulator, with effects that can include the upregulation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway. A decrease in pineal melatonin, as often occurs in the elderly and in conditions associated with high susceptibility to severe viral infection, can therefore have a significant impact on the mitochondrial metabolism and phenotype of immune cells, as well as of other cell types, including CNS glial cells. The suppression of pineal melatonin is proposed to increase the susceptibility to an array of medical conditions, including cancers,16, 17 via the loss of this night\u2010time shift from glycolytic metabolism to OXPHOS. Such interactions of pineal melatonin with mitochondrial metabolism and the melatonergic pathway provide important points of impact by viral infections.",

AhR activation by different ligands can result in some differential effects, complicating the understanding of AhR activation. The AhR is also differentially expressed over the circadian rhythm, thereby linking the AhR to variations in the immune response over the circadian rhythm.\n22\n As noted, AhR activation induces an increase in mitochondrial CYP1B1, thereby contributing to an elevated NAS/melatonin ratio. Given proinflammatory cytokine induction of AhR ligands, AhR activation is therefore an aspect of the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d that can follow viral infection, thereby contributing to suppressed serotonin and melatonin availability, whilst also having consequences for the regulation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway, including the NAS/melatonin ratio.",

As such, the effects of viral infection on the circadian rhythm are intimately linked to alterations in mitochondrial metabolism and the nature of the immune response.

A number of factors can act to inhibit the key cellular changes upon which viruses act, with melatonin being one such factor. The utility of melatonin is paradoxically under\u2010appreciated, if not suppressed, by its ready availability, low cost, and very high safety profile. At the time of writing, there has been a significant impact of covid\u201019 on global economies. It would seem inappropriate to wait for the pharmaceutical companies to provide a targeted antiviral and vaccine in over a year's time, at which point covid\u201019 may well have mutated. As highlighted throughout, viral impacts on human physiology allows for the use of nutriceuticals and pharmaceuticals that may lower infection severity by targeting physiological processes. Melatonin is one such substance. Melatonin is actively inhibited by most viruses, indicating its importance in the regulation of viral infections. A further benefit of melatonin in the management of influenza and covid\u201019 arises from its utility in management of the array of preexisting medical conditions associated with viral\u2010linked fatality. The potential benefits of sodium butyrate in the management of influenza and covid\u201019 infections include its immune suppressive and mitochondrial optimization effects as well as its induction of the melatonergic pathway and ability to decrease the gut permeability that is associated with high risk preexisting medical conditions. Overall, there are biomedical, financial, and moral reasons for developing and testing interventions that may immediately limit the impact of viral infections.",

Other factors, including CYP2C19, mGluR5, P2Y1, and O\u2010demethylation can also regulate the NAS/melatonin ratio.
