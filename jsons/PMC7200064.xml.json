DEN-IM provides the same information of the Genome Detective Virus Typing tool, with the addition of a phylogenetic tree with all samples analysed plus automatic selection of the closest genomes present in the database (optional) and NCBI DENV references (optional).

Additionally, there might be privacy issues in submitting data to external services, such as VirusTAP and GenomeDetective, especially when handling metagenomics data that contain human sequences subjected to strict privacy laws in most countries. Therefore, a stand-alone tool is preferable for these analyses since these can be run in secure local environments. DEN-IM\u2019s main advantage when compared to web-based platforms is the ability to analyse batches of samples in a scalable manner, obtaining a report summarizing all the samples analysed and a phylogeny analysis of all DENV CDSs recovered.",

Indeed, recent studies from areas of high endemicity suggest that co-infection with multiple DENV serotypes may occur frequently [29, 30] and the co-circulation of different DENV strains of the same serotype, but distinct genotypes, in these areas [29] raises the possibility of simultaneous infection with more than one genotype.",
