            "text": "SARS-CoV S protein is a large type I membrane glycoprotein projection from viral envelope (Bosch et al., 2003). SARS-CoV S protein is responsible for binding to cellular receptors and for mediating the fusion of viral and host membranes (Simmons et al., 2004, Tripet et al., 2004). It also contains important virus-neutralizing epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibody in the host species (Hofmann et al., 2004a, Sui et al., 2004). Furthermore, mutations in this gene dramatically affect the virulence, pathogenesis, and host cell tropism (Petit et al., 2005, Yi et al., 2005). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003). Soluble S fragment or ACE2 is able to block S protein-mediated infection (Hofmann et al., 2004b, Moore et al., 2004). Monoclonal antibodies against S protein efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro and in vivo (Greenough et al., 2005, Sui et al., 2004). Moreover, vaccines that express the S protein induce T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, and protect animals from SARS-CoV infection (Chen et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2004). These findings clearly suggest that blocking the binding of the S protein with its cellular receptor can prevent virus entry.",

Natural products, such as glycyrrhizin, baicalin, reserpine, luteolin, ginsenoside-Rb1 and aescin, also abolished SARS-CoV production in vitro; however, the antiviral mechanisms of these compounds remained unclear (Chen et al., 2004, Cinatl et al., 2003a, Wu et al., 2004b, Yi et al., 2004). One of the logical targets of the viral life cycle to inhibit SARS-CoV replication is the step following entry of the infectious virion into the host cell. To discover inhibitors at this stage, we established a biotinylated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate the inhibitory effects of Chinese medicinal herbs on the S protein and ACE2 interaction. Herein we reported the finding that emodin, the likely active component from Rheum officinale and Polygonum multiflorum, blocked both the binding of S protein to ACE2 and the infectivity of S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus to Vero E6 cells.",

In addition to clinically approved drugs, some components of traditional Chinese medicine are found to be effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication (Wu et al., 2004b). For examples, glycyrrhizin, the bioactive compounds of licorice root, is one of the first compounds found to be active against SARS-CoV in vitro (Cinatl et al., 2003a). Sinigrin, a phenolic compound derived from Isatis indigotica root, exhibits the anti-SARS-CoV potential by inhibiting SARS-CoV main proteinase activity (Lin et al., 2005). Baicaline, a flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, inhibits SARS-CoV replication in vitro and in vivo (Chen et al., 2004). These findings might explain some beneficial effects of traditional Chinese medicine observed in SARS patients (Zhang et al., 2004).

Radix et Rhizoma Rhei is widely used in Southeast Asian folk medicine to alleviate liver and kidney damage (Agarwal et al., 2000, Arosio et al., 2000). Radix Polygoni multiflori and Caulis Polygoni multiflori are the most famous tonic traditional medicines in China and Japan, and clinically used for the treatment of coronary heart disease hyperlipidemia, neurosis, and other diseases commonly associated with aging (Xiao et al., 1993). Radix et Rhizoma Rhei has been shown to inhibit herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection by blocking both the attachment and penetration processes (Hsiang et al., 2001). Radix Polygoni multiflori and Caulis Polygoni multiflori have never been identified to exhibit the antiviral effects. In this study, we demonstrated that these herbs might be capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV infection by blockade of the binding of SARS-CoV S protein to cellular receptors.",

            "text": "The genus Rheum and Polygonum are sources of a wide range of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, anthraquinone, stilbenes, and tannins (Nonaka et al., 1977). Anthraquinones, derived from the methanolic extract of Radix et Rhizoma Rhei, have been shown to disrupt the viral envelope, resulting in the abolishment of viral adsorption (Sydiskis et al., 1991). Several studies indicated that anthraquinones exhibited anti-HIV, anti-human cytomegalovirus, anti-HSV, and anti-Epstein-Barr virus activities (Barnard et al., 1992, Konoshima et al., 1989, Schinazi et al., 1990). Recent study further indicated that anthraquinone show antiviral activity but only emodin is a virucidal agent (Alves et al., 2004). Emodin is the active constituent deriving from genus Rheum and Polygonum. Emodin possesses antibacterial, diuretic, and vasorelaxant effects (Huang et al., 1991, Koyama et al., 1988, Zhou and Chen, 1988). It also exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-carcinogenic properties (Chen et al., 2002, Kumar et al., 1998). Emodin is suspected to exhibit its antiviral activity by inhibiting casein kinase 2, which is exploited by many viruses for the phosphorylation of proteins that are essential to their life cycle (Battistutta et al., 2000, Guerra and Issinger, 1999). It also has been demonstrated that emodin disrupted the lipid bilayer, resulting in the inactivation of enveloped virus (Sydiskis et al., 1991). In this study, we demonstrated that emodin was able to block the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 interaction. Preincubation of emodin with S protein or S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus also abolished the SARS-CoV and Vero E6 cell interaction. These findings suggested that in addition to disrupting the viral envelope, emodin might abolish SARS-CoV infection by competing the binding site of S protein with ACE2.",

By comparing the inhibitory efficacy of promazine, anthraquinone, 1,4-bis-(1-anthraquinonylamino)-anthraquinone with emodin, we found that anthraquinone and 1,4-bis-(1-anthraquinonylamino)-anthraquinone slightly inhibited the S protein and ACE2 interaction. Emodin and promazine blocked the S protein and ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that the side chains but not the anthraquinone skeleton has a great impact on the S protein and ACE2 binding.
