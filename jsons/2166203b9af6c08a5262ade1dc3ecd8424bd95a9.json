The leading cause of death is severe acute respiratory syndrome as a consequence of exacerbated inflammatory response accompanied by uncontrolled oxidative stress as well as the inflammatory reaction at the lung level. Until now, there is not a specific and definitive treatment for this pathology that worries the world population, especially the older adults who constitute the main risk group. In this context, it results in a particular interest in the evaluation of the efficacy of existing pharmacological agents that may be used for overcoming or attenuating the severity of this pulmonary complication that has ended the lives of many people worldwide. Vitamin D and melatonin could be good options for achieving this aim, taking into account that they have many shared underlying mechanisms that are able to modulate and control the immune adequately and oxidative response against COVID-19 infection, possibly even through a synergistic interaction. The renin-angiotensin system exaltation with consequent inflammatory response has a leading role in the physiopathology of COVID-19 infection; and it may be down-regulated by vitamin D and melatonin in many organs. Therefore, it is also essential to analyze this potential therapeutic association and their relation with RAS as part of this new approach.",

Some systemic alterations also are observed, mainly in patients over 60 years, which include disturbance of normal plasma levels of lymphocytes, thrombocytes, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase enzyme [4] .

Hence, there are close connections between COVID-19 and renin-angiotensin system (RAS). It has been shown that COVID-19 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2r) to invade human lung epithelial cells and to initiate the infection. At the same time, ACE2 produces anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-fibrotic and anti-hyperplasia effects, since cause the degradation of angiotensin II (Ang II) at lung level by ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas receptor signaling pathway, the counter-regulatory RAS axis with actions opposite to classical RAS axis (ACE/Ang II/AT 1 receptor pathway). The increase in the degradation of Ang II prevents its toxic over-accumulation, which https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117808 Received 7 April 2020; Received in revised form 3 May 2020; Accepted 13 May 2020 would provoke the acute respiratory distress syndrome often present in COVID-19 infection. Therefore, ACE2 has an antagonistic dual action in this viral infection. Also, the expression of ACE2 is lower in males than in females and also lower in older adults than in young people, which could influence the susceptibility of elderly males to death by COVID-19 infection [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . To highlight, this group of patients has a worse prognosis when they are associated, in addition to the elderly condition, with comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, all of them with stimulated RAS.",

In this context, it is known that vitamin D and its metabolites enhance immunity to a great variety of respiratory pathogens in vitro. Moreover, many clinical trials have been demonstrated a strong association between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of developing respiratory infections and that its supplementation reduces the events related to respiratory tract infections [15] [16] [17] [18] . Other clinical trial results showed that vitamin D supplementation markedly reduces the rate of moderate and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary (COP) disease exacerbations in patients with basal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels lower than 25 nmol/L but not in patients with higher levels [19] . It was observed that vitamin D decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections by three main mechanisms: the maintenance of tight junctions to prevent the infiltration of immune cells in lungs and other respiratory tissues, the kill of some viruses through the stimulation of antiviral mechanisms, and the reduction in synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the modulation of the immune system, avoiding the development of pneumonia [20] . In this sense, it is known that vitamin D metabolites modulate the secretion and expression of several chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as type 1 interferon (IFN-1), CXCL8, CXCL10, TNF-alfa and IL-6 in different viral infections [21] .",

In fact, vitamin D deficiency may be associated with a higher risk of getting influenza, other respiratory viral infections, dengue, hepatitis, herpesvirus, and even human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In cell culture studies, vitamin D has antiviral efficacy, especially facing enveloped viruses; therefore, it would be effective against COVID-19. Although the antiviral mechanisms of vitamin D have not been completely established, they may be related to the ability of vitamin D to up-regulate the anti-microbial peptides, human beta-defensin 2 and LL-37 cathelicidin [22, 23] . Also, the evidence shows that melatonin influences, both directly and indirectly, the immune system state [24] . Simultaneously, melatonin has also been suggested as an antiviral hormone. The effects are exerted through different mechanisms related to melatonin's antioxidation, immunomodulation, and anti-inflammation actions [25] . A recent study proposed the use of melatonin for the treatment of COVID-19 using repurposed drugs, this represents an attractive drug strategy using currently available drugs; this would reduce the time and costs in comparison with de novo drug development. The antioxidant properties of melatonin would make it an appropriate candidate drug to relieve the clinical symptoms of patients infected with COVID-19, although melatonin cannot interrupt the replication or transcription of this virus.",

Pulmonary epithelial cells have a high expression of 1 alphahydroxylase level, which allows the local synthesis of 1\u03b1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, also called calcitriol in the lungs. Calcitriol inhibits the production and secretion of many cytokines from bronchial smooth muscle cells, such as growth factor derived from platelets, RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted), and matrix metalloproteinases, which leads to a reduction in smooth muscle cell proliferation and lung inflammation. Moreover, vitamin D stimulates the synthesis of interleukin 10 by CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T-regulatory cells and dendritic cells. At the same time, vitamin D inhibits the activation of dendritic cells by a downregulating expression of CD80/86 and CD40 as co-stimulatory molecules, and stimulates the expression of many anti-infective molecules [30, 31] . 1\u03b1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D supplementation suppresses the recruitment of eosinophil and lymphocyte into the airways, decreases IL-4 production from T cells, and inhibits the migration of T cells, attenuating the inflammatory response [32] .",

Likewise, vitamin D elevated IL10 serum levels, reducing the inflammatory and apoptotic response in these mice [37] . In human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to pollutant particulate matter, vitamin D suppressed the synthesis of 8-isoprostane (8-iso), IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-stimulated by this pollutant agent. Vitamin D caused a rise in the expression of G6PD antioxidant pathway gene and the levels of oxidized glutathione, which suggest that vitamin D, can protect the lungs and airways in asthmatic pathology through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects facing air pollutant exposure [38] . In a murine model of pulmonary inflammation induced by bleomycin, calcitriol reduced early lung inflammation by attenuating immune cell infiltration, repressing pulmonary inflammatory cytokines secretion, blocking nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65, inhibiting phosphorylation of pulmonary p38 MAPK and protein kinase B (Akt), attenuating \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (a marker for epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the lungs, which promotes fibrosis), and decreased transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) upregulated and Smad phosphorylation [39] . Calcitriol also caused a reduction of approximately 40% in neutrophil recruitment to lungs in an animal model of acute lung injury, considerably inhibiting this pathological condition. This anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D may be mediated by the inhibition of IL-8 secretion at the lung level [40] . The administration of vitamin D to neonatal rats with lung injury induced by hyperoxia (as a model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia) caused attenuation of this lesion via several protective actions, such as preserving pulmonary structure integrity, decreasing inflammation by downregulating TLR4 activation, reducing the deposition of the extracellular matrix, and inhibiting lung cell apoptosis [41] . Vitamin D has also shown to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of airway cystic fibrosis since it reduced the expression of CD279 (PD-1) on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Moreover, vitamin D decreased the frequency of CD8+ T and mucosal-associated invariant T cells that co-express the CD38 activation markers and human leucocyte antigen D-related. Therefore, vitamin D treatment would prevent lung damage progression associated with airway cystic fibrosis [42] . The oxidative stress that causes tobacco smoke worsens the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this sense, vitamin D has also been proposed as a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant able to improve the prognosis of this lung pathology in smoking patients [43] . In fact, it has been observed that patients with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have lower plasma levels of vitamin D than healthy patients, suggesting a possible correlation between a deficient antioxidant defense and development of this pulmonary disease [44] . Of central interest to our revision, some years ago, our group raised the discussion on a world pandemic of vitamin D deficiency as a possible explanation by cellular inflammatory response activity RAS-induced [45] . The original discussion involved a significant number of pathologies -mainly cardiovascular-but with a similar inflammatory basis. At present, with the central focus on the acute pulmonary inflammation caused by COVID-19, the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA 2020) reinforces the idea that an adequate supplementation of vitamin D, especially in older people, may be beneficial for vulnerable population groups during this COVID-19 pandemic outbreak [46] (Graphical abstract).",

Moreover, HIS inhibited the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 by blocking the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome independent of mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species [51] . The lung surfactant lipid peroxidation is induced by the production of oxygen radicals from stimulated phagocytes responsible for the development and progression of acute lung injury. In this sense, melatonin alone or combined with other antioxidants markedly reduced lipid peroxidation of this pulmonary surfactant [52] . Intratracheal administration of melatonin provoked a marked reduction of lung lesions and recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to lungs during acute pulmonary injury.

            "text": "It has been suggested that melatonin inhibits pulmonary fibrosis in animal models through the decrease in the migration of fibroblasts as a consequence of the reduction in the activity of chloride channels mediated by protein kinase C [54] . In an animal model with pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin, melatonin provoked a significant reduction in edema and lesions at the lung level. Likewise, melatonin treatment lowered the expression of cyclooxygenase 2, which produces eicosanoids whose role is crucial in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Besides, melatonin caused a decrease in interstitial tissue percentage volume and an increase in the alveolar space percentage volume [55] . Melatonin attenuated the pneumonitis and lung fibrosis caused by radiation exposure through a decrease in inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition, edema, and vascular and alveolar thickening in the lungs [56] . Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis causes the progressive loss of pulmonary function due to tissue cicatrization. Interesting, it has been reported that melatonin and its metabolites can modulate many pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis, such as transforming growth factor \u03b2, Wnt/\u03b2 catenin, interleukin 17A, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor, renin-angiotensin system, endothelin 1, and impaired caveolin 1 function, causing protective effects on lungs [57] . By removing free radicals, melatonin may adequately modulate autophagy pathways and apoptosis, which are key mechanism in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [58] . Additionally, the utilization of melatonin in the treatment of animals with induced hepatopulmonary syndrome was effective in the reduction of lung fibrosis levels, vasodilation, and oxidative stress [59] .",

Pretreatment with melatonin is effective in reducing lung damage in patients subjected to chemotherapy. Melatonin with cyclophosphamide decrease lipid peroxidation, restoring the glutathione levels, and superoxide dismutase/catalase activities.

Melatonin also significantly reduced the oxidative stress and injury of lungs exposed to radiation through the suppression in the infiltration of neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+) and macrophages (CD11b+CD11c-), and the down-regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages (accompanied with a reduction in the release of IL-1\u03b2 and the activity of caspase-1 or CASP1), by the up-regulation of miR-30e levels [79] .

At the same time, this caused a rise in the expression of crucial antioxidant target genes and the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2).

In this regard, melatonin treatment caused a reduction in AT1 expression and normalized the Ang II levels in a model of renal disease [93] . It is also known that there is a local pineal RAS that modulates the synthesis of melatonin. In this regard, it has been indicated that Ang II acts on the AT1 receptors located in pineal gland cells to regulate the expression and activity of tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme, which is involved in the synthesis of melatonin. It has also been demonstrated that the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptosis effects of melatonin are opposite for Ang II [94] . It has reported that patients with chronic renal disease secrete lower nocturnal melatonin concentrations than healthy patients. This altered secretion may be related to increased nocturnal intrarenal RAS activation and kidney damage in patients with this renal disease. This fact reinforces the existence of a close antagonistic interaction between RAS and melatonin [95] . In this regard, it is known that reactive oxygen species are crucial in the activation of intrarenal RAS. Also, it has been shown that antioxidant treatment with melatonin ameliorates the intrarenal RAS over-activation and renal injury in a 5/6 nephrectomized rat model of chronic kidney disease [93, 96] . Despite the lack of studies that specifically show a relationship between melatonin and RAS at the lung level, the existing evidence of this relationship in other organs such as the kidney suggests the possibility of similar behavior at the respiratory level.",

Furthermore, the re-establishment of normal vitamin D levels in patients with D hypovitaminosis provokes blockade of peripheral RAS [99] . Exacerbated activation of RAS at the hepatic level causes liver dysfunction and increases the risk of developing diabetes mellitus. In this sense, it has been found that calcitriol modulates the altered up-regulation of the liver RAS in conditions of insulin resistance [100] . Vitamin D is a potent suppressor of renin production. Thus, low plasma levels of vitamin D are associated with an increase in the synthesis of renin, which results in an over-activation of RAS and an increased production of Ang II, and vice versa [101, 102] . It has been demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency also results in overexpression of angiotensinconverting enzymes (ACE and ACE2) [103] .",

In this regard, it would be specially interesting adequately to define both melatonin and vitamin D supplementation regime used, taking into account both group and individual features of patients that will participate of these studies, since not considering these aspects may lead to obtain heterogeneous and controversial results that could affect their general applicability [106] . However, with the central focus on acute lung inflammation caused by COVID-19, a longitudinal study suggest adequate vitamin D levels in vulnerable groups during this pandemic outbreak by COVID-19 [46] . The last findings showed that the degree of protection against infections increases as vitamin D levels increase, but this relationship has not allowed establishing an adequate cut level yet. Still, an observational study reported that 38 ng/mL are appropriate values to decrease the risk of acute viral respiratory infections [107] . On the other hand, some authors suggest maintaining a serum vitamin D level at least 30 ng/mL or even maintaining it in a range of between 40 and 60 ng/mL to reduce infectious processes. Moreover, recently Dr. Alipio has provided substantial information to physicians and health policymakers. Specifically, it concluded that vitamin D supplementation improves the clinical course of patients infected with COVID-19 based on the increased probability of having a mild result when the serum level of vitamin D increases while a serum decrease in vitamin D is associated with worse clinical evolution [108] . The same recommendation was reinforced by Grant and colleagues who suggested that vitamin D supplementation could reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection [109] . Also, Rhodes and collaborators have proposed vitamin D supplementation, at least for those in the northern hemisphere who are at higher risk of severe illness and death [110] . The same is recommended by the United Kingdom Association of Dietitians [111] and editorials in international scientific rigors.",
