This approach is still common but has been enhanced by a test to detect active shedding of the COVID-19 virus in respiratory specimens, mainly via upper nasal swabs. These tests use real time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)\u2013Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Diagnostics Panels.5,6 A real-time RT-PCR is a diagnostic laboratory test that is used to measure the amount of a specific type of RNA, such as the RNA associated with the COVID-19 virus, as a means of detecting the presence of that virus. It involves reverse transcription of RNA into DNA and then amplification of specific DNA targets using a polymerase chain reaction. The use of these tests moves the diagnosis from one based on symptoms and excluding other possible causes to a diagnosis based on a finding confirming that the individual is shedding COVID-19 virus.",

Second, a negative test in someone who is asymptomatic is of limited value, because the individual could be too early in the disease process to test positive (the incubation period can be from 2 to 14 days after becoming infected), but, more importantly, because the asymptomatic individual may not have been exposed to the virus at the time of the testing but could be exposed even later that day and subsequently become positive. Therefore, for both reasons, the test is generally reserved for individuals who are meaningfully symptomatic. In other words, a negative test does not mean that an individual is safe going forward. An exception to the general rule is to test even asymptomatic individuals who have been in close contact with an active COVID-19 patient. Testing such individuals may detect the presence of virus before they become symptomatic\u2013and some will never become symptomatic but they can still infect others.",

Conversely, the risk of serious infection goes up with age (older than 65 years of age) and/or with comorbid medical conditions including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index \u226540), significant kidney or liver impairment, and/or diabetes. It is very important, however, to be aware that asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals can still spread the disease (termed asymptomatic transmission).

Those cases will now be added to the denominator and thus will bring down the apparent fatality rate. How much it will drop remains to be seen. Currently, the population-wide fatality rate has been estimated to be as low as 0.05% to 1%, but the fatality rate can be as high as 8% in elderly patients in nursing homes.8",

The drugs being studied are mainly, if not exclusively, already marketed for other indications and run the gamut from antimalarial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory drugs to herbal agents and antibodies. While there is a rationale for studying each of these agents, clinical trials must be conducted to determine their efficacy and safety for COVID-19. The reason that most, if not all, of the drugs being studied are already marketed is that their approval provides evidence of safety at least in patients with the illness for which the drug was approved, but the safety profile even of these agents may be different in individuals with COVID-19.

It is also important for our patients to realize that effective treatments are available for the various consequences of COVID-19 and, in addition, that active research is underway to establish the efficacy and safety of other possible treatments and to develop safe and effective vaccines. Most important at this stage is to explain the rationale for and the importance of the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on protecting oneself and the population at large by practicing good hygiene (eg, frequent handwashing) and social distancing to reduce the chances of becoming infected and/or infecting others.
