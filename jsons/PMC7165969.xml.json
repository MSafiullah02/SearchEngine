Abdominal echo revealed a mildly dilated intrahepatic duct and cystic dilatation of the common bile duct. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed dilated right hepatic and common bile ducts, as well as a filling defect over the distal common bile duct. Choledochal cyst was confirmed by MRCP and pathological result. Choledochocystectomy and Roux\u2010en\u2010Y hepaticojejunostomy surgery was performed.

Her white blood cell count was 14 000/\u03bcL, and the C\u2010reactive protein level was 221 mg/L. Her liver function tests (albumin level, 3.72 g/dL; aspartate transaminase, 68 IU/L; alanine transaminase, 85 IU/L; total bilirubin, 0.9 mg/dL) were about normal. After admission, she received fluid supply and intravenous Ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg/day. Results of the stool culture revealed Salmonella group D1 infection. The diagnosis was Salmonella enteritis with severe sepsis. Her fever gradually subsided by day 6 of admission.",

Computed tomography imaging of the head revealed no evidence of an intracranial lesion. A cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative. Blood gas analysis, blood sugar, and electrolytes were all within normal limits. The electroencephalography (EEG) showed generalized continuous delta waves, indicating metabolic encephalopathy. The only reasonable cause of this consciousness change was the elevated serum ammonia level (639 \u03bcg/dL). The patient was treated with lactulose and neomycin, which normalized the serum ammonia level within 2 days. After the serum ammonia level had normalized (54 \u03bcg/dL), the patient's consciousness recovered to a normal (clear) condition. The brain magnetic resonance imaging on admission day 11 showed no specific abnormality and the EEG performed after normalizing the serum ammonia level was normal.",

            "text": "The specific mechanism underlying hyperammonemia after Roux\u2010en\u2010Y surgery remains unknown; however, some possible mechanisms have been identified. First, partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency after Roux\u2010en\u2010Y gastric bypass surgery has been proposed, which leads to impairment of the urea cycle, which in turn results in serum ammonia accumulation. Second, changes in the intestinal flora, which lead to increased ammonia production after the surgery, have also been proposed. Third, a catabolic state accelerating protein breakdown may also contribute to hyperammonemia.1 In our case, hyperammonemia occurred 9 months after the Roux\u2010en\u2010Y surgery; this interval was reminiscent of that in a previous study in which the interval ranged from 1 month to 28 years.2 However, in our case, Roux\u2010en\u2010Y hepaticojejunostomy was different from adult Roux\u2010en\u2010Y gastric bypass. Another interesting finding in this case was the Salmonella colitis, which has been associated with enteric hyperammonemia in equines in a previous study.3 In addition, two human cases of acute encephalopathy associated with salmonellosis have been reported, but not associated with hyperammonemia.4 This implies that Salmonella infection may be a possible trigger of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in patients after Roux\u2010en\u2010Y surgery, and further animal studies may help to elucidate the mechanism.",
