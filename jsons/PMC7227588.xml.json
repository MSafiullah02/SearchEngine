            "text": "Unfortunately, it is well known that we are not all equal in adversity. It has been reported that older people and those with preexistent co-morbidities are at higher risk of dying from Covid-19 in the pandemic [1,3]. It is also possible that ethnic origin influences the prognosis of the Covid-19 infection, since diseases like diabetes and hypertension are more frequently found among patients of African origin [4]. Currently, it is unclear whether there is a direct link between race or ethnicity and the outcome of COVID-19 infection or whether race is a confounding factor due to the hidden effects of diabetes or hypertension, which are more prevalent, for instance, in the Afro-American population. [4]. The availability of health care resources may also play a major role, since access to health care systems may vary between countries or regions, but may also vary within a region according to socioeconomic factors or the presence of chronic diseases [5]. Analyses stratified by those factors should be carried out for the pandemic's data. The first publications from China and Italy reported higher fatality rates, due to the pandemic, in men than in women [6,7]. Following these publications, some authors suggested that the reduced susceptibility of women to viral infections could be attributed to the protection from the X chromosome as well as from sex hormones, which play an essential role in innate and adaptive immunity [8]. Therefore the current gender difference in the response to the pandemic raises a number of questions: here are a few of them.",

We selected only the countries where data were presented by sex, either for prevalence of positive tests, or hospitalization or deaths. We completed the search on PubMed using the Mesh terms: \u201cCovid-19\u201d AND \u201csex\u201d OR \u201cgender\u201d. Our search retrieved 73 items, but only 30 of these were related to the subject through 18 other articles were added to this review (Fig. 1\n) (25-64). Finally, we added personal data from our hospital (an inner-city, university, tertiary hospital located in Brussels) concerning the first hospitalized Covid-19 patients (personal communication). The study was accepted by the Ethical Review Board of the CHU St Pierre.",

According to \u201cOur World on data\u201d, not all countries provide testing data [9,11]. Most countries only provide incomplete data and these concern analyses of tests for the presence of the virus thereby determining whether an individual is infected and not whether he or she has developed immunity (the presence of antibodies). Furthermore, it is often unclear how to interpret tests [9,11]. Some people are tested more than once, some countries report the number of tests performed, others the number of individuals that have been tested. There is also extensive heterogeneity in the number of false positive and negative results, among tests [9,11]. In some countries systematic virus testing by PCR, of large segments of the population, has begun, in others, mildly symptomatic patients were tested, in some others, only severely ill or hospitalized patients were tested. Moreover, the attitude towards testing geriatric patients and health providers who work with infected patients, varied considerably. This explains that the range in testing coverage differs tremendously between countries (while Iceland was testing close to 150 out of 1000 people, the UK was testing 13/1000 people) and demonstrates why the comparison of prevalence between countries is difficult [9,12]. The pandemic started in China, spread to other Asian countries, before reaching Italy and then other European countries and the US. Consequently, diverse countries are at different stages of the epidemic trajectory, and it is difficult to compare or to pool data before the epidemic curve has been completed in the respective countries. This is well illustrated by dynamic graphs [9,10]. The presented data originate therefore from selected, non-random samples, and are characterized by considerable heterogeneity.",

Most, but not all, of early publications from China reported that men presented three times more often prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding, had twice the risk of developing kidney disease as well as more frequent refractory pneumonia and metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) [29,34]. Similarly, in the Seattle and New York areas more men (63% and 76%) were admitted to the ICU [27,35]. In our own hospital the first 272 patients that were admitted had a median age of 60 years; 45% had hypertension, 30% diabetes and 20% cardiovascular diseases. Sixty-six percent of these patients were men. Fifty seven out of 272 were admitted to the ICU, of which 63 % were men (personal communication).",

Nevertheless, these data should be interpreted with great caution. Indeed, other publications did not report sex differences among people with seasonal coronaviruses and respiratory illnesses: among 84,957 episodes of respiratory illness, in Scotland, between 2007 and 2015, the global sex distribution was approximately equal, with 51.6% of patients being female [38]. However, these authors reported greater numbers among males than females for certain infections such as CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-NL63 and influenza, with higher hospitalization and mortality rates in men [38]. Furthermore, there is a marked heterogeneity concerning the current pandemic as to who is being tested. In Iceland, a large proportion of the population has been tested (148 people per thousand inhabitants), whereas in other countries only severely symptomatic patients have been tested (11 per thousand in France). The number of tests is constantly increasing. The \u201cpicture\u201d that we report here, therefore only reflects the situation at the beginning of May 2020. But if we rely on the most comprehensive available data, there seems to be no important difference in terms of infection prevalence between men and women (women have a 2% -8% lower exposure rate than men in some countries). The South Korea data are an exception. Indeed, in this series of 4.212 patients, only 37.7% of the infected ones where male [29]. But the authors provided an explanation: the discrepancy was probably due to an increase of infected women, in a religious group of Daegu [29]. The Belgian data also are somewhat particular because they present data by sex and age group. They found a higher rate of infections in women before the age of 60 and a lower rate thereafter. It is possible, however, that these data are biased by the higher rate of women working in hospitals and more prone to be infected therefore [39,40]. About 70% of confirmed infected health workers were found to be women, in Spain, the USA, Italy and Germany [9,12,21,23].",

On the other hand, the mortality rate will rise, when deaths suspected to be related to Covid -19, in patients untested for the presence of the virus, are attributed to the pandemic (this is what happened in Belgium where about half of the deaths occurred in geriatric living facilities, but only 11% of the patients who died had been tested for Covid 19) [16].

This is, among other factors, due to the documented effects of estrogens, progestogens and androgens [45]. For instance, estrogens suppress T and B cell lymphopoiesis and activates B cell function. Estrogen enhances humoral responses, B cell differentiation and immunoglobulin (Ig) production [45]. The difference in gender immune responses may also have a role in why women have a higher incidence (up to 15 times more for thyroiditis) of autoimmune diseases [45].",

The immune regulatory genes encoded by X chromosome in women has been associated with lower viral load levels, and less inflammation in women than in men, with better immune responses and higher levels of CD4 + T cells, higher levels of antibodies that persist longer, higher levels of TLR7, which result in an increased resistance toward viral infections [45]. The production of inflammatory IL-6 after viral infection is lower in women than in men. Other genes involved in the immunological answer have been implicated and are localized on the X chromosome, like FOXP3 [46]. In any case, if estrogen decreases the risk of Covid-19, it is unlikely to do so by reducing the susceptibility rate, but rather by decreasing the severity of the disease. The worsening of the disease could also be associated with differences in ACE1 polymorphism. Indeed, a significant correlation was found between ACE1 D/I polymorphism and Covid-19 prevalence, when data from 33 countries were extracted (r2 = 0.41) [47].It should be noted that in that study, ACE1 D/I polymorphism was also correlated with Covid-19 mortality, when the data were corrected for the onset of mortality (r2 = 0.457) [47]. These data suggest that ACE1 D/I polymorphism may be a confounder in the spread of COVID19 and the outcome of the infection [47]. The D/I polymorphism of intron 16 of ACE1, located on chromosome 17, is associated with alterations in circulating and tissue concentrations of ACE. The deletion is associated with a reduced expression of ACE2 [47]. SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entrance into the cell [48]. Sex differences in the expression of ACE genes have been reported [49,50]. In animal models, estradiol reduces renal ACE2 activity (it is increased in males and in ovarectomized mice) (50)",

            "text": "Data from epidemiologic-, in vitro-, and knock-out studies, in mice, suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection involves the role of the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). The latter is a cell-surface protein, expressed by epithelial cells among others of the aerodigestive tract [51]. Coronaviruses may depend on TMPRSS2 for viral entry and spread in the host. First viral hemagglutinin protein attaches to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded, by the ACE2 gene [51]. Hemagglutinin is thereafter cleaved to activate internalization of the virus. This step may be dependent on TMPRSS2. TMPRSS2 was first identified in prostate cancer, where its expression is upregulated by prostate cancer cell lines in response to androgens [51]. Often there is a gene fusion between the TMPRSS2 and ERG genes [52]. This gene fusion is consequently controlled by androgen receptor signaling. In men, tumors with the TMPRSS2\u2013ERG fusion have higher insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling, and TMPRSS2\u2013ERG may modify how hormonal risk factors such as obesity influence the risk of metastasis [52], although there seems to be no difference in expression of TMPRSS2 in lung tissue between men and women. Low levels of androgens in women may suffice to sustain TMPRSS2 expression, and. tumors with TMPRSS2\u2013ERG fusion may be responsive to estrogen signaling. Further studies should evaluate TMPRSS2 polymorphisms and whether androgen modulators modify the TMPRSS2 expression and respiratory consequences of SARS-CoV-2 [52].",

Not all of the reports support smoking as a predisposing factor in men or any subgroup for infection with SARS-CoV-2, since they reported only small proportions of smokers among the affected patients (actually much lower than the smoking prevalence in China) [54,55]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that worldwide a third of men smoke, whereas about 6% of women do [55]. This difference in smoking habits results in much higher rates of disease and co-morbidities that are influenced by smoking [55]. There are, for instance, almost four times as many lung cancers in men than in women in France, Germany, Italy and South Korea, [55]. Men develop cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes more frequently and at a younger age than women. These co-morbidities have been associated with an increased rate of death associated with Covid-19 infection [56]. Bots et al reported that while the gap between sexes, in cases of cardiovascular disease narrowed between 1980 and 2010, Coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality was still on average about five times higher in men and the stroke mortality was twice as high. [57]. The pattern of the case fatality rate, seen for COVID-19, may therefore be comparable to that of other major causes of mortality in the elderly, such as heart disease, diabetes, or combined influenza and pneumonia [58].",

These results may also have implications as treatments and vaccines are currently being tested on men and women [61]. Although women seem to die less frequently than men from the immediate consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, women may be more exposed, given their predominant roles as caregivers within families and as front-line health-care workers [62]. Moreover, we do not yet know what the long-term consequences will be on women\u2019s health. For instance, the pandemic will have dramatic consequences on economic issues, which often affect women more than men [63,64]",
