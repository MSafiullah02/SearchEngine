Abstract Objectives: To clarify changes in the implementation of personal protective measures among ordinary Japanese citizens from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak to the community transmission phase. Methods: This longitudinal, internet-based survey included 2,141 people (50.8% men; 20-79 years). The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted from February 25-27, 2020 and April 1-6, 2020, respectively. Participants were asked how often they implemented the 5 personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys. Results: The prevalence of 3 of the 5 personal protective measures significantly improved in the community transmission phase compared to the early phase. Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4% to 82.2%. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed, men and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of highincome households.",

On that day, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in Japan was 2,178, and the number of patients had increased rapidly, mainly in Tokyo (WHO, 2020b). The questionnaires were placed in a secure section of a website, and potential respondents received a specific URL in their invitation email. The 2,400 respondents to the baseline survey responded to the questionnaire voluntarily, and the response cut-off date was April 6. On April 7, a day after the completion date of the survey, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency (Prime Minister of Japan, 2020).",

As for social distancing measures, participants were asked to disclose the frequency in which they avoided places where many people would be gathered together. Regarding self-isolation, the participants were asked the question, \"if you have a fever or a cold, can you take time off from work?\" Participants responded using a 5-point Likert scale (1: \"Definitely can\", 2:",

Moreover, men and persons with low household income levels made fewer behavior awareness activities related to avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, which is assumed to be the reason for the lack of improvement in that behavior. Moreover, face touching behavior is a common habit (Kwok et al., 2015) , therefore unless one is extremely careful, it may be difficult to stop. This study suggests that the implementation status of personal protective measures in ordinary citizens can change with each pandemic phase and awareness activities that are introduced. It may be important to monitor these changes for developing effective educational activities.",

It may be effective to focus on populations with such sociodemographic characteristics when providing education on personal protective measures during an infectious disease pandemic, which can lead to constraints on both time and resources. Previous studies on self-isolation have reported that people who are unable J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to work from home or lose income when absent from work have a lower rate of self-isolation (Blake et al., 2010 , Eastwood et al., 2009 .

Furthermore, the age and sex demographics of the participants in this study were different from that of the general Japanese population (Statistics Bureau of Japan, 2019). Second, the results may only be directly applied to the Japanese population. In the case of other populations with different cultural, ethnic, and geographical backgrounds, the prevalence of personal protective measures and implementation status of behavior change may be differ considerably when compared with those reported in the present survey. Despite these limitations, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first study to clarify the behavior changes in personal protective measures among ordinary Japanese citizens from the early phase of COVID-19 in Japan to the community transmission phase, and to identify an association between the behavior changes and each sociodemographic factor.",

This study suggests that the implementation status of personal protective measures in ordinary citizens changes with each pandemic phase. This study also reveals that while the implementation of personal protective measures had improved in the pandemic phase of COVID-19, there is potential for improvement, especially when it comes to avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth, and among men and persons with low household income levels.During the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence of social distancing measures and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth was approximately 60%, and these measures had much lower prevalence than other personal protective measures. However, in the community transmission phase, while there was a significant increase in the prevalence of social distancing measures, the prevalence of the latter measures remained almost unchanged. These differences may be due to differences in awareness activities introduced by the Japanese government. From the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, the adoption of measures by the Japanese government to cope with COVID-19 infection focused on identifying clusters of COVID-19 patients by tracing the route of transmission of patients with COVID-19. Among these measures, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reported that clusters tended to occur in locations that satisfied 3 conditions: (i) closed spaces with poor ventilation, (ii) crowded spaces with many people, and (iii) conversations and vocalization in close proximity (within one arm's length of one another). Such locations included for instance, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f athletic gyms and buffet style meals (JMHLW, 2020b). Based on this report, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare issued large-scale warnings to ordinary citizens to resist going to locations that satisfied these 3 conditions, in conjunction with educational activity about hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette (JMHLW, 2020c). Additionally, on March 26, the governors of Tokyo and 4 neighboring prefectures issued a joint message urging people to avoid crowded places (Tokyo Metropolitan Government, 2020). The implementation of social distancing measures is thought to have vastly improved through these awareness activities. On the other hand, there were no large-scale",

As only 34.7% of survey respondents were implementing all 5 personal protective measures, this clearly revealed that there was still room for improvement regarding personal protective measures implemented by ordinary citizens. Since the time the survey was conducted, the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases within Japan have steadily increased, and on March 19, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare called on the Japanese people to change their behavior regarding personal protective measures, to suppress transmission (JMHLW, 2020b). However, thereafter, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in Japan rapidly increased mainly in major metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo and Osaka regions, and the pandemic shifted into the community transmission phase. On April 7, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in Japan totaled 3,906, which led to the Japanese government to declare a state of emergency (Prime Minister of Japan, 2020). Although unclear, the status of personal protective measures among ordinary citizens may have changed depending on the pandemic phase shift. It is important, therefore, to clarify the current status of such at the community transmission phase when considering what is needed in future awareness activities.Therefore, the aim of this study was to clarify the change in implementation of personal protective measures among ordinary citizens, from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak to the community transmission phase in Japan, and to identify measures which have improved in addition to recognizing those that are insufficient.",
