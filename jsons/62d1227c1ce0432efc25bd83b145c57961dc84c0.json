This virus has currently spread across 212 countries which resulted in 2,416,135 active cases of infection, and approximately 165,939 mortalities, as per WHO (2020). There are many drugs currently being tested which include antiviral (remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, and arbidol), antimalarial (hydroxychloroquine), and anticancer (interferon-alpha 2b) agents. These drug candidates are undergoing clinical trials, and their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be proven. Under such a situation, siRNA based treatment can provide an effective solution in combating COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020). Some earlier studies revealed that siRNA candidates were effectively used against the outbreak of SARS and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), recapitulated in Table 1 .",

The viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 is 29 kbp in size and one of the largest genomes among the RNA virus. This genome consists of fourteen open reading frames (ORFs) which coded for twentyseven structural and nonstructural proteins (Wu et al., 2020a) . At the 5' end, there are the two largest ORFs, namely ORF1a and ORF1b which are translated into a single large poly-protein by the ribosome through a frame-shift event.

Among two viral proteases the sequence which codes for the nsp3 has been reported to be less conserved . However, the sequence which codes for the protease 3CL (nsp5) has been observed to be highly conserved among the annotated sequences (Wu et al., 2020b) . Currently, the protease has been considered as a major drug target for multiple antiviral agents, which are presently undergoing clinical trials. Thus, the sequence coding for nsp5 can be treated as a potential target for RNAi using siRNA based therapeutics. Other potential targets include the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Rd-Rp) which is located in the ORF1b, stretching from 13-16 kbp on the viral genome. Downstream to the sequences (from 16-18 kbp) the site coding for the viral helicase has been identified. These two sites have been reported to be highly conserved among the annotated genome of SARS-CoV-2 along with the earlier genomes of beta coronaviruses like SARS and MERS (Wu et al., 2020b) . Thus, these two sites can be considered to be potential targets for RNAi using siRNA.",

Besides, in 2017, six siRNA have been developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (USA) and Vir Biotechnology against infectious diseases. Further, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (USA) has designed and synthesized over 350 siRNA targeting highly conserved regions of the available SARS-CoV-2 genome (Hodgson, 2020) .

Therefore, techniques designed for optimal delivery of drugs onto the lung epithelial cells can provide better and timely results. In this context, Conti and co-researchers have demonstrated an in vitro testing of poly (amidoamine) dendrimer nanocarriers for the potential aerosol-based delivery system of siRNA onto lung epithelial cells (Conti et al., 2014) . However, the nanocarrier delivery system has limits to its efficient delivery. Hence, there is a need to overcome these limitations by formulating an effective delivery system that can offer unique advances to the field of inhaled siRNA formulation.",

Thus, for the treatment of COVID-19 siRNA based therapy can be developed against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, where siRNAs can hit the highly conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and also can act as an inhibitor to suppress the genetic disorders of the lungs. This approach could help to achieve a better treatment goal that can reduce the pandemic threat of COVID-19. The invention describes the development of double-stranded siRNA analogs that contain locked nucleic acid (LNA), which showed a specific post-transcriptional gene silencing by RNAi. These siRNAs can be useful to target the SARS gene. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in Vero cells when it was infected with SARS and reduced the CPE after siRNA treatment.
