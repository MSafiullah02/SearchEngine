The tonsillar tissues were obtained during tonsillectomy due to chronic tonsillitis or tonsillar hypertrophy. Total nucleic acids were extracted from the sera, tonsillar tissues, nasal swabs and NPAs with the DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK), and from the fecal samples with QIAamp Qiagen DNA Stool kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The tonsillar tissues and fecal samples were examined individually whereas the sera, NPAs and nasal swabs were initially studied in pools of five, followed by individual examination of positive pools. A negative control of molecular biology grade water was extracted and included in the PCR between every 10 samples.",

The 25-\u03bcl amplification reaction consisted of 1\u00d7 GeneAmp PCR buffer I (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK), each dNTP at 0.2 mM, 20 pmol each primer, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and 5 \u03bcl of sample. To increase the robustness of fecal PCRs, BSA (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) included at a final concentration of 0.1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl. The cycling conditions for the first and the second PCRs were 5 min at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95 \u00b0C for 17 s, 58 \u00b0C for 20 s and 72 \u00b0C for 20 s). All samples positive for MCPyV were reanalyzed with the LT1/M1 nested PCR primer set as described2 and sequenced. Samples positive with the LT3 nested primer set but negative with the LT1/M1 primer pair were analyzed with a third (seminested) PCR. Primers LT3sF (5\u2032-CTAAGTGCGCTTGTATTAGCTGTAAG-3\u2032) and LT3 antisense were used for the first-round PCR whereas the internal primers LT3sF and LT3iR were used for the second-round PCR. The mastermix and cycling conditions were as for the other two PCRs. WUPyV and KIPyV detection was performed by using primer set A as described.8 All MCPyV and KIPyV/WUPyV PCR products of correct size were sequenced for confirmation of specificity. For use as positive controls and to determine assay sensitivities by limiting dilution analysis, plasmids containing the VP2 gene of WUPyV (EU693907) and KIPyV (EU358767) and the LT31 amplification product of MCPyV (EU375803) were constructed; the amplification products of the VP2 genes were cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) whereas the MCPyV LT3 region was synthesized and cloned into pGOv4 by Gene Oracle, Inc. (San Leandro, USA). In the MCPyV and KIPyV/WUPyV assays, plasmid controls with 30 and 5 copies/reaction were reproducibly positive, respectively. Of note, the sensitivities were unaffected by the inclusion of genomic human DNA from cultured 293T cells at 100 ng per reaction (4 ng/\u03bcl). In non-nested format with 40 PCR cycles the LT3 primers had a sensitivity 1 log lower than that of the nested assay both in the presence and absence of human genomic DNA.",

Sera from the children with MCPyV DNA in NPA were PCR-negative. Two of the 75 fecal samples (2.7%) tested positive for KIPyV DNA whereas all tested negative for MCPyV and WUPyV. Of the 840 sera studied for MCPyV, only one from a leukemic child was PCR-positive. The WUPyV/KIPyV screening of NPAs and sera from the wheezing children had been done in a prior study (manuscript in submission). For MCPyV the highest frequency of viral DNA detection in any sample type was in the tonsillar tissues; in this group of 229 subjects the average ages of the patients that were PCR-positive for MCPyV or WUPyV were 39.4 years (median 42; range 7\u201370) and 4.8 years (median 4; range 2\u20138), respectively, whereas the average ages of the patients PCR-negative for the two viruses were 22 years (median 20; range 2\u201372) and 23 years (median 21; range 2\u201372), respectively. The ages of the patients with MCPyV or WUPyV DNA in tonsils were ranked9 and compared with the unequal variance t-test, yielding a statistically significant difference of p\n < 0.001 (Fig. 2\n). Also the difference in the median ages of the patients with and without MCPyV (p\n = 0.032) or WUPyV (p\n < 0.001) in tonsil was statistically significant. Serum samples from the tonsillectomy patients collected at the time of operation were PCR-negative for the three viruses. Most of the tonsillar MCPyV findings were from patients with chronic tonsillitis or tonsillar hyperplasia, 5/108 (4.9%) and 3/42 (7.1%), respectively. WUPyV occurred in patients with hyperplastic palatine or adenoid tonsillitis (2 of 25, 8%), chronic tonsillitis (2 of 108, 1.9%), and chronic pansinuitis (1 of 2, 50%).",

Furthermore, we showed widespread occurrence of MCPyV DNA in tonsillar tissue. This may be a general feature of human polyomaviruses, as tonsillar tissues can harbor both JCV21 and BKV22 DNA and tonsillar stromal cells have been shown to be susceptible to JCV infection.23 Blood cell-derived MCPyV positivity of the tonsils could not be completely ruled out as only serum samples (all of which tested negative for MCPyV DNA) obtained at the time of operation were available from our tonsillectomy patients. The potential presence of MCPyV in blood cells of immunocompetent individuals as opposed to serum is an interesting topic for further research.",

This is very interesting, as in the NPAs of immunocompetent individuals KIPyV and WUPyV occur more frequently in children than adults.24 In light of the equivalent NPA prevalences of WUPyV and MCPyV among immunocompetent children, the notable age difference in tonsillar occurrence of MCPyV versus WUPyV possibly reflects a major dissimilarity in the life cycles of these two viruses, related with persistence versus primary infection. Indeed, our small-scale DNase data suggest that even among children MCPyV DNA in the upper airways is not necessarily encapsidated among all individuals. On the basis of our results and those of Goh et al.20 showing MCPyV DNA mainly in adults, it is tempting to speculate that the occurrence of MCPyV in the respiratory tract may involve active shedding coupled with respiratory transmission among children, leading to DNA persistence towards adulthood.",
