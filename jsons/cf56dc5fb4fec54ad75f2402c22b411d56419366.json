Much of the literature 383 on Antarctic krill details methods and success-rates in extracting proteins, fatty acids, 384 amino acids and lipids from this species.

            "text": "biotechnology related activity is suggested by the number of Antarctic 616 related filings containing DNA or amino acid sequences. Sequence data, under the place 617 holder term 'digital sequence information' or DSI, has become an increasing focus of 618 attention in international policy debates on access and benefit-sharing for genetic 619 resources in recent years under the Convention on Biological Diversity and a range of other 620 policy processes [149-154]. In the context of debates on a new treaty on marine 621 biodiversity under the United Nations Law of the Sea, counts of genetic sequences in patent 622 data have had a significant impact on policy debates and have attracted significant publicity 623 [155-158]. 624 In total 928 first filings contained a verifiable Antarctic species and DNA and amino acid 625 sequence data. After the exclusion of records where the ubiquitous E. coli was the only 626 species recorded in a document with a sequence listing, 739 first filings contained 627 sequences. 628 In practice, considerable caution is required in interpreting the sequence data in patent 629 documents. Existing research has adopted the novel approach of cumulating counts of 630 sequences in patent documents that are linked to marine species in patent sequence data 631 from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) [155-158]. This serves the 632 purpose of demonstrating the increasing presence of sequences from marine organism in 633 patent activity and links to wider questions about benefit-sharing. However, the use of 634 cumulative counts may inadvertently disguise the reality that underlying patent filings, 635 reflecting the outcomes of investments in research and development, may be much weaker 636 and made up of spikes of individual documents containing large numbers of sequences 637 [157]. Figure 8 displays three different approaches to counting sequence data. 638 Approaches to Sequence Counts for Patent Activity for Antarctic Species 640Beginning with Figure 8(1A) we observe overall trends in first filings containing sequences 641 for documents that also contain an Antarctic species (after the exclusion of E. coli). Trends 642 in filing are clearly modest over this period and peak at 95 filings in 2014. Moving up to 1B) we present counts of the number of sequences that appeared in documents by 644 year. This reveals clear spikes in activity that consist of a filing in 2004 containing 108,053 645 sequences, a filing in 2006 containing 150,913 sequences and a set of 7 filings in 2015 646 containing 78,771 of 80,602 sequences recorded that year. The significance of this becomes 647 clearer when we consider Figure 8(1C) which displays the cumulative sum over time 648",

The prominence of E. coli in the Antarctic literature mainly arises from its use as a 419 research tool [79-81]. Examples of the use of E. coli in Antarctic research include a 420 dosimeter to evaluate the penetration of biologically active ultraviolet radiation within a 421 water column based on the sensitivity of a particular strain of E. coli to ultraviolet radiation 422 [82]. However, E. coli also appears in the taxonomic record for Antarctica through records 423 from Davis Station. Growing interest in the implications of the increasing presence of 424 humans in Antarctica are reflected in exploration of the impacts of E. coli strains in human 425 waste upon the Antarctic environment [68,83]. As noted above, the impacts of human 426 associated E. coli have also become a focus of research in seal populations [68]. Research 427 on the health of penguin populations has identified antibiotic resistant bacteria such as E. 428 coli in Gentoo penguin breeding areas [84]. The discovery of antibiotic resistant strains of 429 E. coli in penguin populations implies that human activities are responsible [84]. 430 Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, recorded in the taxonomic record at Frei Montalva Base 431 on King George Island, appears in over 100 publications. The majority of research tends to 432 focus on the capacity of this species to exist at cold temperatures [85-87]. Beta-433 galactosidase from this species has been shown to outperform other commercial beta-434 galactosidases suggesting that the cold-adapted beta-galactosidase could be used to 435 hydrolyse lactose in dairy products processed in refrigerated plants [88]. The bacterium 436 Oleispira antarctica, recorded in the taxonomic record at Road Bay in the Ross Sea, appears 437 in 18 publications, two of which have received 150 or more citations suggesting significant 438 interest. This interest appears to arise from O. antarctica's hydrocarbon degrading 439 properties which may be beneficial in the bioremediation of oil spills [89,90]. 440 In the case of plants, Parnikoza et al. 2011 highlight that Deschampsia antarctica and 441 Colobanthus quitensis are the only two flowering plants that have colonized the Maritime 442 Antarctic [91]. As we will see below they are of significant commercial interest in 443 connection with cold resistance [92]. Deschampsia antarctica appears in 250 papers and 444 dominates the data on plants. Existing research suggests that Deschampsia antarctica may 445 be useful as a bioindicator of climate change in Western Antarctica [93] while more recent 446 work focuses on the mechanisms that allow it to survive in the Antarctic environment [94] 447 and how these mechanisms fare in conditions of warming temperatures [95-97]. 448 Difficulties in the interpretation of the taxonomic record for Antarctica are reflected in the 449 presence of the Australian seagrass Amphibolis antarctica in the raw taxonomic data which 450 as far as we can establish, despite its name, does not have a recorded distribution in 451 Antarctica or the Southern Ocean. 452 For chromists, single and multicellular eukaryotes including some algae and diatoms, 453 scientific attention has focused on Phaeocystis antarctica and Durvillaea antarctica (New 454 Zealand Bull Kelp). The marine phytoplankton Phaeocystis antarctica has been a focus of 455 analysis in connection with the formation of algal blooms and carbon sequestration in the 456 Southern Ocean and their role in the carbon cycle [98]. Recent work has focused on issues 457 such as the role of iron in colony formation and the impacts of iron limitation and ocean 458 acidification on P. antarctica [99,100]. This in turn is linked with wider research on the 459 implications of ocean acidification for diatoms and other marine organisms in Antarctica 460 [101]. Research on P. antarctica also involved simulation of iron fertilization that can be 461 linked to models for geoengineering experiments [102,103]. 462 Durvillaea antarctica appears to be quite widely distributed in the Southern Ocean and 463 countries such as New Zealand and Chile. Research on this species includes work on kelp 464 rafts in the Southern Ocean and subantarctic, including the role of kelp mats in the 465 dispersal of marine bivalves [104,105]. More commercially oriented research is reflected in 466 work on the nutritional content of the edible D. Antarctica [106]. The anaerobic digestion of 467 this species to produce biogas has also been evaluated as a method for producing 468 renewable energy [107]. Research has also been conducted to extract soluble \u03b2-1,3/1,6-D-469 glucan from this species, which has been indicated to have immunostimulant properties 470 [108]. High-M alginate extracted from this species, which has also been shown to have 471 immunostimulatory properties, has been used in studies to create a dietary supplement for 472 feeding and weaning Atlantic cod [109]. 473 Protozoans have received relatively little scientific attention in Antarctic research to date. 474 Diaphanoeca grandis isolated from saline Antarctic lakes and coastal sites in research 475 dating to the early 1990s has received the greatest attention so far [110-112]. Research on 476 Bicosta spinifera dating to the early 1980s is also limited but has focused on issues such as 477 seasonal variation in abundance [113] with more recent work reporting on the Polarstern 478 project in the Weddell Sea [114]. In recent work, Cryothecomonas armigera is being used in 479 work to develop a bioassay to inform water specific guidelines to address pollution in 480 Antarctica [115-117]. 481 Research on Archaea, single celled microorganisms, in Antarctica appears to be very 482 limited (not shown in Figure 4). The majority of research has focused on Methanococcoides 483 burtonii, with over 30 publications. However, a number of these papers have been 484 relatively highly cited such as work on genomics, proteomics and membrane lipid analysis 485 in understanding mechanisms for cold adaptation [118-120]. Additional work has also 486 taken place on Halorubrum lacusprofundi focusing on amino acid substitutions in cold 487 adapted proteins [121]. 488 Viruses have very limited coverage in GBIF data and are therefore not picked up in text 489 mining with this data source. However, as we might expect, research on viruses appears in 490 472 publications for other species in the data . This includes viruses in Antarctic lakes 491 [122], research on viruses and antibodies in Antarctic seals [123,124], a wider review of 492 research on viruses in cetaceans [125,126] and research on viruses in penguin populations 493 [127,128]. 494Our purpose in this section has been to provide a brief overview of biodiversity research in 495Antarctica and the Southern Ocean and to begin to focus on research activity with actual or 496 potential commercial value. We turn now to the growing body of literature on 497bioprospecting, or biological research with a commercial focus, in the Antarctic. 498The Bioprospecting Literature 499 A significant literature has emerged that makes reference to bioprospecting or biological 500 prospecting in Antarctica, consisting of over 90 articles. These articles range from research 501 with a specific focus on identifying the potentially useful properties of Antarctic organisms 502 to consideration of the policy implications of commercially focused research and 503 development for the Antarctic environment and benefit-sharing. 504The most highly cited article on bioprospecting in the Antarctic is a 2013 analysis of fungal",

            "text": "They go on to explain that: 979 \"Sponge samples were collected from various sites around Palmer Station, Antarctica in the austral summer of980 2011. The collection sites chosen were Norsel Point (64\u00b045.674' S, 64\u00b005.467'W), Bonaparte Point (64\u00b046.748' S, 64\u00b002.542'W), Gamage Point (64\u00b046.345' S 64\u00b002.915'W), and Laggard Island (64\u00b048.568' S, 64 00.984'W) at 982 depths between 5-35 m below sea level. Samples were frozen and transported back to the University of South Florida at -70\u00b0C where tissues were lyophilized and stored at -80\u00b0C until further processing.\"The applicants claim a method for treatingbacterial  infections including MRSA biofilms 985 with a darwinolide compound. However, this is also a case where researchers time the 986 submission of a scientific article and a patent filing in such a way that the research article, 987 which would become prior art, does not destroy the novelty of the claimed invention. Thus, 988 the earliest filing date of the patent application is in April 2016 shortly before the 989 publication of the scientific article in May 2016 and is followed in October 2017 by 990 publication of the Patent Cooperation Treaty patent application [249]. 991 A third example highlights that applicants may obtain samples through Antarctic research 992 centres operating as intermediaries. A 2009 first filing from India became the basis for a 993 2010 international Patent Cooperation Treaty application [250] for methods of preparing a 994 plant extract using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry where the plant extract 995 is from Deschampsia antarctica. This application describes how: 996 \"The frozen plant material was procured from Coppermine Peninsula on Robert Island, South Shetland Island, Antarctica and was exported to us by Instituto Antarctico Chileno\u2026\"This application also makes extensive reference to the wider literature on D. antarctica that 999 mention places such as Signy Island and King George Island signifying that the intensity of 1000 occurrences of references to Antarctic places may be a good indicator of collection of 1001 samples in the Antarctic. However, the main insight from this example is that in some cases 1002an Antarctic research institute may serve as an intermediary providing Antarctic material 1003 for commercially oriented research. It is unclear whether the institute was aware of this 1004 purpose when providing the material or whether a material transfer agreement (MTA) was 1005 established between the institute and the applicants. 1006A fourth example illustrates the point raised above that a sample may come from multiple 1007 sources. A 2006 filing by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute for \"A light-driven 1008 energy generation system using proteorhodopsin\" explains that: 1009Using the same proteorhodopsin-specific PCR primers, as for instance shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, proteorhodopsin 1010 genes were also amplified from bacterioplankton extracts. As mentioned above, any proteorhodopsin-specific PCR 1011 primer can be used. These bacterioplankton extracts include those from the Monterey Bay (referred to as MB 1012 clones), the Southern Ocean (Palmer Station, referred to as PAL clones), and waters of the central North PacificOcean (Hawaii Ocean Time series station, referred to as HOT clones). 1014 A similar multi-source case is provided by a filing from Woods Hole Oceanographic 1015 Institute for metagenomic samples collected by drilling through sea ice in the Ross Sea 1016 combined with analysis of other diatoms to create a recombinant organism for the 1017 expression of Cobalamin (vitamin B12) [251]. An additional example is a filling for a 1018 cryoprotective agent from a novel Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain CY 01 (KCTC 12867BP) 1019 collected from the Antarctic Ocean as well as Arctic strains [252]. While these applications 1020 explicitly involve samples from the Antarctic, it can be challenging to determine whether 1021 the organisms are material to (part of) the claimed invention. 1022 References to Antarctic place names occur in the context of wider international debates on 1023 disclosure of the origin of genetic material in patent applications and the consequences of 1024 such disclosure [253]. Increasingly, countries that are party to the Convention on Biological 1025Diversity and its Nagoya Protocol are requiring disclosure of origin in support of the 1026 implementation of these agreements. However, the consequences of disclosure, and failure 1027 to disclose, may vary considerably. The present research reveals that applicants will often 1028 mention Antarctic origin and may, as we have just seen, be explicit about the places and 1029coordinates of collection. In international policy debates at WIPO, agreement on 1030international requirements for disclosure of origin has become stuck on disagreements 1031 about the consequences of disclosure, such as revocation of a granted patent in the absence 1032 of evidence of prior informed consent and a benefit-sharing agreement with the country of 1033 origin[253,254]. However, in the case of the Antarctic, as for marine biodiversity in Areas 1034Beyond National Jurisdiction, the function of disclosure could perhaps better be seen as 1035 making the contribution of Antarctic biodiversity to innovation (as partly reflected in the 1036 patent system) visible to the wider world[157,160]. That is, disclosure can assist with 1037 supporting greater awareness of the ecosystem services provided by Antarctic biodiversity 1038 and thus of Antarctica to wider human welfare. However, debates on disclosure of origin 1039also raise harder questions about the contribution that those who seek to commercially 1040develop and use Antarctic biodiversity should make to its conservation. We turn to how 1041 this issue might be addressed in closing. 1042 This paper has sought to contribute to mapping the scientific and patent landscape for 1044 biodiversity and innovation in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. The growing availability 1045of open access databases of scientific, patent and taxonomic data means that it is possible 1046 to begin to map these landscapes at scale using methods that are open, transparent and 1047 accessible to a range of disciplines. However, as we have also sought to demonstrate, 1048 exploiting opportunities for analysis at scale reveals issues around data completeness and 1049 data quality. In the case of patent data, these challenges extend to requirements for 1050 considerable care in interpretation of the Antarctic origin of genetic resources within 1051 patent documents and whether they are actually material to or part of the claimed 1052 invention. 1053Issues around data completeness and data quality can be addressed through approaches 1054such as re-indexing to address gaps, in the case of Microsoft Academic Graph, and closer 1055 attention to data cleaning using locality information for taxonomic data from GBIF. The 1056growing availability of the full texts of both scientific and patent publications presents 1057 important opportunities to improve access to the full results of scientific research but also 1058 presents challenges in moving beyond pure metadata based approaches. Open access 1059 databases such as the Lens have made important breakthroughs by linking together 1060 scientific and patent data through citations. This in turn makes it easier to monitor patent 1061 activity arising from research involving Antarctic biodiversity. Developments in machine 1062 learning, in the form of Natural Language Processing libraries such as spaCy, mean that it is 1063 now possible to imagine",
