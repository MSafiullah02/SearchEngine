Laboratory management is responsible ultimately to implement the procedures and work practices necessary to ensure a safe work environment and to adequately train and educate their employees in laboratory safety. This is a challenging task for clinical microbiology laboratories as globalization increases the dispersion of infectious agents throughout the world, climate changes expand the endemic ranges of some microbial pathogens and their vectors, new microbial pathogens are recognized, antimicrobial resistance increases, acts of bioterrorism are threatened, and new technologies and tests are introduced into the laboratory. These events expand the potential exposure of clinical microbiologists and other health care workers to infrequently encountered infectious agents. Considering all of these factors, it is increasingly difficult for regulatory agencies and professional organizations to provide detailed up-to-date safety guidelines for all new situations. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS) recently published guidelines for the protection of laboratorians from occupationally acquired infections (1). A portion of this report is a review of the safety recommendations outlined in that document.",

The exception has been the national reporting of occupationally acquired HIV infections to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For other LAIs, risk is estimated based on historic data, case reports, periodic surveys of laboratories, and personal communications (2). The historical data published by Pike (3, 4) were instrumental in identifying the risk associated with working in clinical and research laboratories and documenting the common routes of transmission (Table 1\n). However, these data were published in the 1970s and are not reflective of modern laboratories, due in part to the implementation of many safety procedures and work practices based on Pike's observations. Today, the general consensus is that LAIs are infrequent but occur most often in individuals who work in the clinical microbiology laboratory (5, 6). Wilson and Reller (7) estimated that the annual rate of LAIs in the U.S. is approximately 1 to 5 infections per 1,000 employees.",

Bacteria cause most LAIs, while parasites are infrequent causes. For an infectious risk to be present, there must be a susceptible host, a route of transmission, and a concentration of the infectious agent sufficiently to cause infection. Organisms that pose the greatest risk to laboratorians include the bloodborne pathogens (BBP) (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus [HCV], and hepatitis B virus [HBV]), because of the severity of infection and lack of curative therapy; new or emerging agents (e.g., West Nile virus [WNV], and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus [SARS-CoV]); due in part to a lack of knowledge and experience handling these organisms; and some bioterrorism agents, because identification is often delayed or is incorrect. Other potential exposure risks for which there are little published safety data include the introduction of new methods and instrumentation prior to performing a risk assessment and the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) recovered in the laboratory.",

Historical data have clearly identified four common routes of transmission in the laboratory: (i) percutaneous inoculation (e.g., needlesticks, scalpels, and broken glass), (ii) inhalation following aerosolization of pathogen (e.g., centrifugation, mixing, flaming loops), (iii) cutaneous exposure through splashes or contact with contaminated formites, and (iv) ingestion by placing contaminated objects in the mouth (Table 1). Although most agents are associated with a primary route of transmission (e.g., BBP and percutaneous inoculation), they can be transmitted in the laboratory by multiple routes. For example, the primary mode of transmission for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is by inhalation, but cutaneous infection has occurred following percutaneous inoculation (8). Therefore, safety procedures and programs should focus on work practices, containment equipment, and facilities that interrupt the transmission of agents by all routes and therefore protect against all LAIs",

Therefore, it is prudent to decontaminate work surfaces at least daily, practice proper hand hygiene, and when appropriate, use barrier precautions to reduce skin and nasal colonization or infection. Similarly, VISA or VRSA cultures should be manipulated in a BSC to prevent accidental transmission to a laboratory worker.",

This concept is fundamental to safety in the microbiology laboratory and, if practiced, will prevent or reduce the contact of potentially infectious material with the skin or mucous membranes of laboratorians (1). Two key components of laboratory safety are proper hand hygiene (23) and the use of gloves when performing routine laboratory work with blood or other potentially infectious material or contacting surfaces potentially contaminated with these materials (1). Frequent hand hygiene is extremely important, and the hands should be washed with soap and water (or an alcohol-based product) after removal of gloves, after accidental skin contact with potentially infectious material, or after a break in a glove. Soap and water should be used when hands are visibly contaminated with potentially infectious material. Whether gloves should be required for routine bench work in the microbiology laboratory is a question that has been discussed for years. There is no doubt that laboratory surfaces are contaminated, (22) but to my knowledge, there is no specific regulation that requires the use of gloves while manipulating cultures. However, clinical microbiologists should be given the option of wearing gloves, if they choose.",

Laboratory workers in a BSL2 facility should be suspicious of bacteria that are difficult to identify and that exhibit characteristics of Brucella spp. or F. tularensis.
