            "text": "Clinical research is most often conducted in an environment that is part of a larger health-care system. Both the conduct of clinical research and the practice of clinical medicine involve risk. The extent to which risk is present in the hospital environment has been well documented in recent years. The Institute of Medicine's groundbreaking report \u201cTo Err is Human\u201d characterized the magnitude of the occurrence of medical errors during patient care in the United States, estimating that between 44,000 and 98,000 hospital-based deaths per year could be attributed to medical errors.1 In more than 15 years since this report was released, multiple studies have provided supporting evidence for these staggering findings.2 In a 2016 study by Makary and colleagues that analyzed medical death data from four studies conducted from 2000 to 2008, the authors estimated that more than 250,000 deaths each year in the United States result from medical errors.3 In the study, authors highlighted that these results place medical errors third on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's list of leading causes of death in the United States\u2014behind the 611,105 deaths that are associated with heart disease and the 584,881 deaths attributable to cancer, and just above the 149,205 patients who die from respiratory diseases. Findings from a study by Van Den Bos et al. estimate that the annual cost of measurable medical errors, in 2008, was over $17 billion.4 According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 2 million health care-associated infections occur each year; costing the United States an estimated $20 billion dollars.5 A 2011 study by Magill and colleagues estimated the number of health care-associated infections to be 721,800.6 These figures are unquestionably daunting; however, they do not include either the scores of near misses or latent errors (errors that never reach the patient or result in harm) or the system failures that influence a patient's health-care experiences negatively. Based on these striking mortality and health care-associated infections data, the fact that the health-care environment is fraught with risks and potential errors that must be identified and deftly managed if patients are to be cared for safely and appropriately seems incontrovertible.",

            "text": "Nolan describes a system as \u201ca collection of interdependent elements that interact to achieve a common purpose.\u201d8 If one applies this definition to the clinical care environment, examples of interdependent elements that one might consider include such factors as the institution's culture (especially with respect to safety), the skill mix and competence of the staff, the availability of state-of-the-art equipment, and the quality of information systems, to name but a few. The health-care literature is rife with examples of system failures resulting in harm to patients; for example, significant medication errors (e.g., the death of the Boston Globe reporter, Betsy Lehman, who died of a massive chemotherapy overdose and the tragic loss of young Josie King),9, 10, 11, 12 wrong site surgeries that often top the Joint Commission's list of reported sentinel events,13 and the relative epidemic of health care-associated infections.6, 14, 15, 16 Whereas any one of these events could be considered an error resulting from an individual provider's negligence, systems thinking compels us to consider these adverse events as failures in a series of interrelated and/or codependent processes or systems. In truth, in the current complex health-care environment such events almost invariably involve a series of missed opportunities to correct the error\u2014hence they truly represent system failures.14 This shift in focus\u2014from the individual to the system\u2014forces organizations to broaden their analyses of incidents and, thereby, broaden the impact of any improvements. Because of the endemic nature of errors and system failures in clinical care, investigators and review bodies must collaborate with the health-care practitioners with whom they entrust their participants' safety to assure that the system/environment in which clinical research is conducted is safe and has the necessary infrastructure in place to support the study. Further, the research team must have strategies in place to monitor the clinical research environment to identify risks and clinical events that could contribute to adverse events and/or protocol deviations and to assure that processes are in place to prevent, mitigate, and manage risks.",

For the purposes of this chapter, the term \u201cconduct of clinical research\u201d refers both to activities outlined in the research study as well as those intrinsic clinical care activities that are essential to the successful implementation of a study but that may not be explicitly described in the research protocol. Examples of such clinical care activities include infection control measures, medication management procedures, the design of the physical environment, and information management. These critical clinical care functions often are assumed to be present and functioning at an optimal level to support the investigator's study; however, investigators and/or institutional review boards may lack formal processes to assess the capacity of the clinical environment to support the study under review. The research team must engage the clinical care organization proactively to assure that the appropriate infrastructure is in place to provide care safely and efficiently to study participants. In collaboration with the health-care team, the research team should have processes in place to\u2022identify clinical care functions that are critical to the success of the protocol;\u2022identify and assess critical risk points of the clinical care processes that might place participants at undue clinical risk and/or compromise the integrity of the study;\u2022monitor the clinical environment continually for adverse events, errors, near misses, and process failures;\u2022assess systematically and thoroughly errors that occur;\n\u2022establish an armamentarium of process improvement tools with which to manage process and system issues when they are identified; and\u2022develop robust processes to communicate and learn from untoward events that occur in the clinical care environment in the spirit of organizational learning and continuous improvement.\n",

We provide this specific information about our own institution to provide context for this discussion. The NIH CC occupies a unique position in the nation's biomedical research establishment. The NIH CC is a distinctive and complex hospital whose primary mission is the support of science. High-quality clinical care is provided at the NIH CC in the context of clinical research, but the primary driver of that care is science. The NIH CC provides clinical research support for, and clinical care to, the research participants enrolled in the more than 1600 active clinical research protocols ongoing at the NIH CC. The NIH CC's research portfolio differs substantively from most academic medical centers. Of the NIH Clinical Center's approximately 1600 clinical research protocols nearly half are designed to study the natural history and pathogenesis of rare, often genetically determined rare diseases. The other half of the NIH Clinical Center's clinical research portfolio is comprised of clinical trials. More than 90% of these clinical trials are phase I or phase II \u201cproof-of-principle\u201d or \u201cfirst-in-human\u201d translational trials. This unique intersection of clinical care and clinical research mandates that the NIH CC use myriad health-care performance improvement tools creatively to manage the safe implementation of a broad spectrum of clinical research protocols effectively.",

At that time, investigators at the NIH Clinical Center authored two protocols designed to gain insight into the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of this new disease as well as to assess strategies for the clinical evaluation and management of patients with SARS. These protocols perhaps positioned the NIH CC somewhat uniquely as one of the few health-care facilities in the world that was actively recruiting patients with SARS. The research protocols received rigorous scientific and human subject protections vetting and approval, and the principal investigators were poised to enroll their first participant/patient. However, several circumstances caused the NIH CC, as an organization, to pause before the decision was made to open recruitment.",

Further, at the time of the SARS outbreak, the NIH CC's clinical environment was in a building\u2014constructed in the 1950s\u2014that posed significant infrastructural hurdles to providing safe care to patients infected with highly infectious (and in this instance, possibly airborne) pathogens. In this complex clinical context, investigators from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases submitted protocols requiring the provision of care for highly infectious SARS patients. Subsequently, these proposals were presented to the NIH community. As one might have anticipated, several investigators who provide care for patients who have severely compromised immune function were adamantly opposed to admitting patients with SARS or other highly contagious respiratory illnesses electively to the NIH CC. However, because of the clearly urgent public health need, as well as the potential unprecedented scientific opportunities, the leadership of the NIH CC approached the issue not by asking: \u201cCan we safely provide care to patients with SARS?\u201d but rather by asking the question, \u201cHow can we care safely for all of our patients?\u201d As the protocols were being reviewed for human subjects' protection, the leadership of the NIH CC set out to identify the critical clinical functions that they felt must be present and operating at optimal levels to admit and care for SARS patients safely. This assessment required the collaboration of the research team, the leadership of the NIH CC, and the active participation of key clinical departments such as hospital epidemiology, nursing, critical care medicine, pharmacy, and housekeeping. Using flowcharting techniques,17, 18 the team carefully cataloged each step in the research process and identified clinical care functions necessary to support the research requirements. Clinical and operational functions that were identified as being essential to the successful care of these patients are outlined in Table 36.2\n.",

Clinical research programs, too, should implement processes to assess the performance of the clinical research enterprise systematically\u2014primarily to assess for risks to the participants, investigators, and care providers, as well as for threats to the integrity of the study. Collecting and reporting adverse events that occur during the course of a research study is a mandatory component of both the research process and the protection of human subjects. However, event reporting in clinical research focuses on individual protocols, not on how the system of clinical research is performing as a whole. This \u201cprotocol-centric\u201d focus fails to identify clinical care and clinical research system failures that potentially might impact participant safety across multiple studies. Murff and his colleagues35, 36 have described the need for research teams to develop reporting systems that collect data about reportable adverse events, as well as \u201cnear misses\u201d or \u201clatent failures\u201d in the clinical care and clinical research environments. Near misses or latent failures are errors that do not result in patient/participant harm; however, these events do have the potential to do harm if the circumstances of the event were somewhat different. Identifying and analyzing near misses or system failures provide the care and research teams the luxury of designing and implementing interventions to interrupt the error cycle prior to the occurrence of a serious error. Surveillance for errors, adverse events, and latent errors in the clinical care or research setting can be accomplished using a variety of strategies including1 event reporting systems2; electronic surveillance systems that utilize clinical triggers to identify errors; and3 analysis of clinical performance measurement data.",

The reports indicated that drug delivery was delayed on several occasions because the infusion pumps had inexplicably suspended infusion. Each time the infusion would stop, the nursing staff would troubleshoot the problem, requiring the infusions to be restarted several times during a single delivery, potentially resulting in a delay of study drug administration, and potentially adversely affecting drug levels and pharmacokinetics. Alerted to these administration errors via the ORS, the Pharmacy Quality Officer met with the study investigators, the clinical care staff, and the nursing staff. Collectively the group conducted an intensive review of the events. The common factor identified in each incident was that the infusion pumps stopped due to an \u201cair in line\u201d alert, although no air was noted in the tubing. All efforts to determine the cause of the alert generation were futile. Finally, the team contacted the research team who had developed and conducted the initial laboratory testing of the drug in an effort to identify a reason for the alerts. Following the review of the current medication administration procedure for this study, the research team noted that the initial safety testing for the drug was performed using a different brand of intravenous tubing than the brand stocked and used in the NIH Clinical Center. The team changed the procedure for administering the study drug, mandating a change in the brand of intravenous tubing used. No additional reports of misadministrations were reported during the remainder of the study. Whereas these incidents do not appear to have caused any harm to the participant or the study, the potential for harm to the participant and the study are obvious, and any future potential adverse events or protocol deviations were averted as a result of identifying this series of events via the NIH CC's ORS.",

Establishing a nonpunitive \u201cjust culture\u201d that encourages the reporting of events, free of reprisal, is essential to maintaining a robust and meaningful reporting system. Equally important is an organizational commitment to using the data provided by staff to understand system and process errors and failures and to develop strategies to mitigate risk and improve care. Finally, organizations should be committed to sharing performance measurement data with the staff to keep them informed and aligned with institutional performance improvement strategies.",

Electronic surveillance for adverse events has proven effective in identifying, in real-time, events such as adverse drug toxicities and interactions, health care-associated infections, and other iatrogenic injuries or events. This technology uses clinical triggers to signal the presence of potential errors or adverse events. Clinical triggers can include high-risk medications, select abnormal laboratory values (e.g., abnormal serum potassium levels, microbiology culture results), treatment interventions such as antidotes (e.g., Naloxone (Narcan), vitamin K), corrective procedures (e.g., chest tube insertions and dialysis) and unplanned intensive care unit admissions.9, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 Electronic event surveillance for clinical care and clinical research errors and latent failures provides a tool that administrative institutional leadership, clinicians, and research investigators can use to identify, mitigate, and report these events in a much timelier manner than traditional, voluntary incident reporting systems.",

All hospitals and other health-care facilities accredited by the Joint Commission must have systems in place to measure, continually, a proscribed list of clinical activities.53 Most hospitals also participate in a variety of national and/or state clinical performance measurement activities, often as a condition of funding and certification.54 Regardless of the type of performance indicators used by an organization to monitor patient care processes, these measures, if well designed and appropriately implemented, provide valuable insight into the health-care organization's management of critical patient care processes. Table 36.3\nprovides a list of frequently monitored processes of care. Performance measurement activity in the clinical research setting also should take into consideration important clinical metrics associated with the scientific protocol under study.
