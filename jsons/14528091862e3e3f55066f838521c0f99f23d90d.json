Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) plays a prominent role in identifying cardiac complications of COVID-19, but TTE imaging places sonographers within two feet of patients' faces, well within the droplet zone, for at least 20 minutes. Consequently, cardiac sonographers have among the highest exposures to COVID-19 among healthcare providers, and consume scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) with each exam. We sought to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the utilization and appropriateness of TTE in a busy academic medical center in an urban endemic area.",

Response to the pandemic requires striving for the optimal balance between best patient care and the safety of providers. This is particularly challenging for TTE practice, given its core role in the diagnosis of cardiac complications of COVID-19, and the uniquely high exposure risk for sonographers performing TTE. In addition, hospital and State COVID-19 pandemic mandates have required fundamental alterations in TTE practice. At our institution, these factors necessarily required a new workflow involving physician review of all echocardiography referrals. This focused intervention resulted in a marked decrease in TTE volume, and significant improvements in the appropriateness of the TTEs performed. The rate of \"rarely appropriate\" TTEs performed in our laboratory is found to be at the low end of the published experience, but nonetheless a \"physician level review\" of echo orders essentially eliminated \"rarely appropriate\" TTEs. (3) (4) (5) While the context of a pandemic may limit applicability, this finding is relevant in light of the recent Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandate requiring AUC determinations for \"advanced\" imaging modalities. Echocardiography is not subject to this mandate, but our findings support the conclusion that more scrutiny at the point of order is beneficial. (6) L-TTE utilization as a percentage of all TTEs has also markedly increased during the pandemic.",

(1) For each TTE study, complete (C-TTE) vs. limited (L-TTE) status, and Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) designation as \"appropriate\", \"maybe appropriate\", and \"rarely appropriate\", was established. (2) TTE utilization and appropriateness were compared before and after hospital and State issued pandemic guidelines required the UCM echocardiography laboratory to enact a new workflow protocol (PROTOCOL) to guide TTE practice. UCM and the State of Illinois directives required cessation of elective procedures, elimination of non-essential personnel and strict social distancing. (1) The PROTOCOL consisted of the following: All inpatient and outpatient TTE requests undergo physician review prior to study performance, with approval based on the standards of \"medical necessity and time sensitivity\". Each patient's COVID-19 infection status was considered, though given rapidly evolving testing availability and diagnostic algorithms during this period, all prospective TTEs were treated as potentially COVID positive. This PROTOCOL was enacted on March 17 th , 2020; the day of the first death from COVID-19 in Illinois, when there were 160 reported cases statewide. At study conclusion 14 days later, there were 6,980 cases and 141 deaths in Illinois from COVID-19. (1) No member of the UCM echocardiography laboratory staff tested positive for COVID-19.",
