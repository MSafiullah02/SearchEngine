Such goals are in line with the science curricula in many other countries (e.g., American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1993; Council of Ministers of Education, 1997; Millar & Osborne, 1998). Earlier studies reported the disappointing findings that both students and science teachers have inadequate understanding of NOS (Lederman, 1992); however, there is encouraging empirical evidence that can inform initiatives to improve NOS understandings. Explicit and reflective approaches in teaching NOS can support learner development of sophisticated NOS ideas (Abd-El-Khalick & Lederman, 2000; Khishfe & Abd-El-Khalick, 2002). The critical review of Abd-El-Khalick and Lederman suggested that \u201capproaches that utilize elements from history and philosophy of science and/or direct instruction on NOS are more effective in achieving that end than approaches that utilize science process-skills instruction or non-reflective inquiry-based activities\u201d (p. 694).",

Since the early 2000s, we have made use of science stories, such as the discovery of penicillin, the development of cowpox, Newton\u2019s proposition of law of universal gravitation, and the treatment of stomach ulcers (Tao, 2002) as a medium through which NOS could be introduced. However, due to the lack of both understanding of NOS and experience in learning and teaching NOS, many teachers who have not formerly participated in our teacher education program only saw these stories as a good means of arousing students\u2019 interest without having noticed the intended learning outcomes of NOS understandings. Such a situation was reflected in the comment made by a junior science teacher who had been telling the interesting science stories to his students. He came to realize his oversight of not having made good use of the stories for teaching NOS after he had attended our NOS in-service education workshop:I found the story on stomach ulcers very interesting\u2026. Marshall tested his hypothesis by trialing out himself.... Students all enjoyed the story\u2026 I only realized now that there are deeper meanings behind the story and other important learning outcomes to be achieved through it and other stories.\n",

The results showed that better understanding of NOS does not necessarily result from doing science per se (Bell et al., 2003). There also needs to be frequent opportunities for reflection on NOS in the context of that authentic scientific research experience through journal writing and seminars (Schwartz et al., 2004). In their comparison of the epistemic beliefs of chemistry students and research chemists, Samarapungavan, Westby, and Bodner (2006) came to the broadly similar conclusion that apprenticeship experiences are no automatic guarantee of epistemic development in students. They suggested that engaging students and expert researchers in conversation and reflection on epistemic issues related to research work will have a greater chance of success. While apprenticeship or internship experiences offer enormous potential for enhancing NOS understanding, they created major logistic problems\u2014especially in East Asian classrooms, where class size is routinely about 40. Our response has been to present students with insights into authentic scientific practice through the development of a case study of contemporary scientific practice that shows the importance of developing models to understand the phenomena\u2014a procedure essential in the understanding of NOS.",

The SARS incident was a unique experience through which everyone in Hong Kong had lived and the memories of which would stay for years to come. At the beginning of the outbreak, the causative agent was not known, the pattern of spread was not identified, mortality was soaring, yet an effective treatment regimen was uncertain. It attracted the attention of the whole world as scientists worked indefatigably to understand the biology of the disease, develop new diagnostic tests, and design new treatments. Extensive media coverage kept people up to date on the latest development of scientific knowledge generated from the scientific inquiry about the disease.",

Since January 2005, we have been using the SARS story in developing NOS understanding among hundreds of preservice and in-service science teachers. The contextual approach which situated the learning of NOS in the authentic scientific research during the SARS epidemic was found to be particularly successful in promoting teachers\u2019 understanding of NOS in terms of (1) the realization of inseparable links between science and the social, cultural, and political environment; (2) deeper understanding of how science and technology impact on each other; and (3) a richer appreciation of the processes of authentic scientific inquiry and the humanistic character of scientists (Wong, Kwan, Hodson, & Yung, 2009). We have also recently reported some exemplary classroom practice translating teachers\u2019 own effective learning involving these NOS aspects in their science lessons (Wong, Wan, & Cheng, 2011). However, we are mindful not to be complacent with the learning of the three areas of NOS aspects as we noted less sophisticated discussion on the role and nature of scientific models and modeling in classroom practice (Cheng, Wong, & Yung, 2007), let alone the discussion of multiple levels of representations in science.",

We then compare and contrast the nature of models and modeling as reflected in authentic scientific practice and that appear in the Biology Curriculum and Assessment Guide (CDC-HKEAA, 2007). In Hong Kong, biology is arguably the science subject that has placed greatest attention to NOS. Many local biology teachers also believe that understanding of NOS will be assessed in the public examination for the reformed curriculum (Kwan, 2011).",

He stayed at the Metropole Hotel, from where SARS started to creep into the Hong Kong community. A number of residents living in the hotel were infected. Most of them left Hong Kong by air to other countries and quickly spread the disease to the rest of the world without anyone or even the World Health Organization (WHO) noticing. By 4 March 2003, a Hong Kong young man visited a friend staying on the same floor at the Metropole Hotel as Dr. Liu got infected. He was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital.

The increasing presence of bats and bat products in food and traditional medicine markets in southern China and elsewhere in Asia was also a contextual factor which pointed to bats as their next target (Li et al., 2005). They did found SARS-like coronaviruses when they started surveying different species of bats in the search for the natural reservoir of SARS coronavirus. They then generated the genomic sequences of the viral samples from bats carrying the SARS-like viruses, infected civet cats, and infected human beings to study the evolutionary history of the SARS-like coronavirus. In October 2005, the scientists reported the phylogenetic trees (or evolutionary trees) constructed after a series of tedious comparison of the genomic patterns and logical reasoning in the deduction of the order of changes that happened to the genomic sequence of the strains during the evolution of the viral strains. Figure 13.2 shows a simplified form (for ease of illustration) of a typical phylogenetic tree, essentially scientific model, constructed by the scientists. The tree indicated bats as the likely natural host of the SARS-like coronaviruses. This finding would be welcomed by people who would benefit from the understanding and knowledge of the natural host and the interaction between the host, intermediate host, and human beings. Prevention of future outbreak thus becomes more feasible. Of course employers and employees of the restaurants serving exotic animals would not be too pleased to know that the ban of sale of civet cats (political decision) which had affected their livelihood was based on less than robust scientific evidence.\n",

In the search of the natural host of the SARS-like coronaviruses, phylogenetic trees or evolutionary diagrams should illustrate the proximity of the viruses from bats, civets, and humans in terms of the genetic distance (see Fig. 13.2). As shown in the left of the phylogenetic tree, all these viruses share a common ancestral strain found in bats. Given the time for mutation, two strains were formed (stage 100132). One strain shares similar genetic composition as the ancestor (strain 8), whereas the other evolved (stage 2) to form several new species that only infect bats (strains 5\u20137), and another evolved to form viruses infects bats, civets, and humans (strains 1\u20134). The reason why the coronavirus found in civets (strain 1) are so similar to the human strains (strains 2 and 3) is that they share the same recent ancestor evolved in stage 3. Moreover, viral strain 4 (infecting bats) and strains 1\u20133 are placed at the same level in the diagram, indicating the high possibility of the bat virus spreading to humans either by direct contact or through civets (or the animals) sold in the markets.",

From early to mid-April, scientists obtained the following crucial findings through epidemiological and environmental investigations as documented in their report to the government on 17 April 2003 (Department of Health, Government of Hong Kong Special Administration Region, 2003):The index patient (first case of the Amoy Gardens outbreak) visited his relatives on 14 and 19 March 2003 in a flat of Block E in mid-March around the time he developed SARS. He was having diarrhea at that time and he used the toilet there.Scientists collected every possible type of sample including the air, the water stored in the tank for the use of residents of Block E, the sewage system, as well as cats, dogs, rats, and cockroaches in and around Block E. They quickly identified the presence of SARS coronavirus in rats, cockroaches around the residential area, and the sewage from the drainage system of the building.Many Amoy Gardens residents reported foul smell in their bathrooms which suggested that the U-shaped water trap (U-traps) of the floor drainage system might not be filled with water to perform the proper function of preventing foul smell and insects from entering the bathrooms. (As the toilets, the basins, and the bathtubs were frequently used, their U-traps should be charged with water and should have been functioning properly. However, most households had the habit of cleaning the bathroom floor by mopping instead of flushing it with water, and the U-traps of the floor drains were likely to be dry and not functioning properly.)The pattern of vertical spread of the infection (most of the infected residents lived in Flat 7 and Flat 8, with more cases on higher floors) suggested a close connection to the sewage system that is connected to the same drainage system.However, the drainage system alone could not explain the high infection rate of the higher floors. It was then postulated that habit of the use of exhaust fan during the use of the bathroom might explain such a pattern.[Later epidemiological data revealed that \u201cthose who had used their exhaust fans while taking a shower had a five times greater chance of getting SARS\u201d (Abraham, 2004, p. 75).]\n",

However, the pattern of spread in Amoy Gardens reveals that iconic diagrams at the macro level did play an essential role in modeling the way in which the disease was spread in the building. In different contexts and in fulfilling different needs, models at different levels of representations were evoked. In other words, scientific modeling is a purposeful activity and is conducted to fulfill the needs of particular contexts.",
