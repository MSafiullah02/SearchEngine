            "text": "The H strain of infectious bronchitis (IB) was one of the earliest live attenuated IB vaccines to be developed and has continued to be used in most parts of the world for almost 50 years. It was developed for use at both the 52nd (H52) and 120th (H120) vaccine levels and, because of it ability to provide heterologous cross-protection against a number of IB viruses of different serotypes, has proved to be one of the most enduring live attenuated IB vaccines. In fact, the H120 vaccine is possibly the most widely used live attenuated IB vaccine globally to this day. The use of H52 has, however, declined with the introduction of safe and highly efficacious inactivated IB vaccines. This review documents the original studies to isolate and attenuate the H strain by serial embryo passage, and describes the early studies to demonstrate its efficacy in laboratory studies and under field conditions. The efficacy of the H vaccine in providing cross-protection against some of the many IB variants now reported worldwide is also discussed, and possible future vaccination strategies for IB considered.",

These serotypes may arise either as a result of sponta-neous mutation or by recombination (Kusters et al., 1990; Cavanagh et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1993; Jia et al., 1995) . Cross-protection between different serotypes is variable or poor (Cavanagh, 2003) and therefore the choice of vaccine strain should be carefully considered. Careful and correct diagnosis (De Wit, 2000) is also needed for IBV identification as outbreaks of IB still occur in vaccinated flocks, and the virus strains isolated from such outbreaks are frequently of a different serotype from the vaccine strain applied. Bijlenga (1956) diagnosed IB for the first time in the Netherlands by means of virus isolation, experimental infection of chickens and serum neutralization (SN) tests. This virus isolate was used to prepare a vaccine by serial passage in embryonated chicken eggs up to the 52nd passage level (Bijlenga, 1960) . The vaccine was named IB vaccine strain H52, the H standing for the initial letter of the name (Huyben) of the owner of the broiler farm in the province of Brabant, in the southern part of the Netherlands, from which the virus was isolated. The letter H has often been used mistakenly (Rosenberger et al., 1976; Winterfield et al., 1976a; Winterfield et al., 1976b; Owen et al., 1991) as an abbreviation of ''Holland''. This publication, while rectifying this mistake, will concentrate on describing the origin of the H strain vaccine, its isolation and adaptation to embryonated eggs, as well as the original experimental and field vaccinations performed almost 50 years ago.",

After 6 days of incubation the embryos were still alive and the allantoic fluid (AF) was harvested. No embryonic abnormalities were observed and the AF was inoculated in the same way into another five 10-day-old embryonated eggs (blind passage). At the second egg passage, two embryos died on day 7 of incubation. The AF of these two eggs was harvested and the next passage was performed with this material. All 51 passages were carried out using AF from embryos that died, with the exception of the first blind passage (Table 1) . On the third passage, one embryo died 9 days after inoculation. The amnion was thickened and adhered closely to the embryo. The dwarfed embryo weighed only 5 g (at that age a normal embryo weighs approximately 20 g) and was curled into a spherical form with its deformed feet over its head (Bijlenga, 1956) . These embryonic changes are typical of an IB infection and the provisional diagnosis was that this virus was the causative agent of the problem at the Huyben farm.",

The H120 virus meets these criteria well and is ideally suited for use in young, susceptible chicks, while the H52 vaccine, being less attenuated, is only suitable for use in older chickens that already have some protective immunity as a result of the earlier application of a milder (more attenuated) vaccine or perhaps an IB field exposure. Also, despite the proven safety of the H120 vaccine for young susceptible chicks, it must be remembered that any live IBV vaccine can increase susceptibility to colibacillosis under high Escherichia coli pressure (Smith et al., 1985; Matthijs et al., 2003) .",

Immune responses to IBV have been reviewed (Dhinakar Raj & Jones, 1997b; Cavanagh, 2003) . Using either the H strain (Gillette, 1981; Toro & Fernandez, 1994) or the M41 strain (Hawkes et al., 1983) , the importance of local immunity in the respiratory tract as a first line of defence against IB challenge has been demonstrated. Furthermore, Davelaar & Kouwenhoven (1976 , 1980 , using both the H120 and H52 vaccine strains, have demonstrated the importance of the Harderian gland in the development of the immunity induced by IB vaccination. These findings were confirmed by Toro et al. (1996) who, in a histological study, demonstrated increased plasma cell numbers and enlargement of lymphoid foci following eye-drop administration of the H120 vaccine. It is therefore essential that this local immunity is stimulated by the careful application of the live attenuated IB vaccines. In addition, the induction of high and persistent levels of systemic immunity is necessary to provide lifelong protection against IB challenges. Although the role of CMI in protecting against IB challenges has been less well studied than have other aspects of IB-induced immunity, there is evidence that CMI responses occur following vaccination with the H strain (Timms & Bracewell, 1981) . Furthermore, it has been suggested that the CMI response to H120 vaccination may be cross-reactive (Dhinakar Raj & Jones, 1997a) . Correct and careful application of the IB vaccine is therefore essential to optimize the stimulation of all types of protective immunity.",

IBV serotypes that are highly unrelated to one another generally do not cross-protect well. This issue is a primary reason why IB is so difficult to control under field conditions, where flocks are likely to become infected with heterologous field strains commonly referred to as variants. The H strain, a Massachusetts serotype IB vaccine, has shown a rare ability to cross-protect against heterologous serotypes, thus making it potentially effective for controlling a broader range of serotypes. In the 1970s, research laboratories evaluated the lower egg-passaged H52 strain as a vaccine against heterologous strains found in the US. Winterfield & Fadly (1975) reported that an H53 vaccine immunized well, providing 70% to 100% protection against challenge with the Connecticut, JMK, Iowa 97, Iowa 609, Florida, Holte, Gray, MD27 and SE17 serotypes. Rosenberger et al. (1976) found H52 cross-protected well (58% to 88%) against challenge with US serotypes Connecticut, JMK, Florida and Holte, but to a much lesser degree (11% to 33%) against Arkansas 99, Gray and Maine 209. Protection in these studies was assessed 4 weeks after vaccination by challenging the chicks via the respiratory tract and performing virus recovery attempts from the trachea 4 or 5 days later.",

However, in vaccination and challenge trials, the efficacy of an IB vaccine is usually expressed as the percentage of vaccinated birds protected against challenge. Therefore, in order to obtain more relevant information, a different approach to vaccine efficacy determination has been investigated (De Wit et al., 1998) . These workers performed a study of flock immunity after H120 vaccination and M41 challenge in order to determine whether vaccination reduced virus transmission; that is, to test whether IBV transmission among vaccinated chickens was significantly reduced compared with that among unvaccinated chickens. In two vaccinated and two unvaccinated groups of specific pathogen free chickens, a standard measure for virus transmission, the reproduction ratio, was determined (the reproduction ratio being defined as the average number of new infections caused by one typical infectious individual during its entire infectious period). It was found that a single eye-drop vaccination with H120 reduced the transmission of the challenge virus among the vaccinated chickens significantly compared with the transmission among the unvaccinated chickens. H120 is the only IBV vaccine that has so far been tested in this way.",

Live attenuated vaccines are cost-effective for the poultry industry, especially for broiler production, although two drawbacks of such vaccines are worthy of mention. Live vaccines produce varying degrees of pathology that may make them unsuitable for use in some flocks depending on various factors, such as their age, maternal or active immune status and the presence of concurrent infections. Second, the difficulties associated with, and the importance of, the correct application of live IB vaccines has probably been underestimated. Vaccine instability and reversion to virulence is a serious concern when vaccines are accidentally or purposefully over diluted. Clearly improvements in live vaccine stability and safety are needed in the future.",

Inactivated IB vaccines do not generally cross-protect well against heterologous challenge, although, if given prior to 18 weeks of age, they may protect pullets after they are placed on layer farms or complexes where variant serotypes are known to exist (Ladman et al., 2002) . While expensive because of the cost of production and the need for administration by injection, inactivated vaccines are safe because they do not replicate in the bird.

Other immunization technologies include using transgenic-derived IBV protein (Song et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 2003) , DNA vaccination (Seo et al., 1997; Kapczynski et al., 2003) , homologous (IBV) vectored recombinant (Casais et al., 2001 (Casais et al., , 2003 Dove et al., 2001; Hodgson et al., 2004) and heterologous virusvectored vaccines (Yu et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2002; Johnson et al., 2003) .
