Our previous study indicated that there was an endocytosis pathway for hMPV cell entry. Lipid raft is a specific structure at the cell surface and it has been demonstrated to play an important role in endocytosis process of many viruses. In this study, we investigated whether and how lipid raft can take part in the hMPV entry. The confocal microscope was used to detect colocalization of hMPV and lipid raft marker. We demonstrated that colocalizations were increased along with the viral infection and hMPV particles transferred to the perinuclear region with lipid raft. When specific lipid raft inhibitors: methyl-\u03b2 cyclodextrin and nystatin were used, hMPV cell entry was inhibited and viral titer decreased dramatically. With the replenishment of exogenous cholesterol, hMPV recovered quickly. These data suggest that lipid raft plays an important role in hMPV endocytosis and maybe one of the pathways for hMPV cell entry. K E Y W O R D S cell entry, human metapneumovirus, lipid raft 1 | INTRODUCTION Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was firstly isolated from airway secretions and identified in 2001. Based on viral gene sequence analysis, hMPV belongs to Metapneumovirus genus, Paramyxoviridae family, and Pneumovirinae subfamily. 1,2 Global epidemiological surveys showed that hMPV is prevalent worldwide with severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 3 The morbidity of hMPV infection varies from 3% to 14.3% and the predominate strain is subtype A. 4-7 The susceptible populations of hMPV are infants, young children, immunocompromised individuals, and elderly people. 8-10 Children under 5 years old have almost been infected by hMPV. Recently, respiratory problems caused by hMPV became more and more obvious and cannot be neglected anymore. hMPV could cause lethal infection in posttransplant patients and bring more serious consequences when host coinfected with other virus. 11,12 However, to date, there is no effective vaccine for prevention from hMPV infection. There are two main pathways for virus cell entry, fused with cellular membrane (fusion) and endocytosis. 13-15 Endocytosis is a complex process, in this procedure, the virus binds to specific receptors on cell membrane firstly. Then downstream signaling J Med Virol. 2019;91:949-957.",

This microdomain usually takes emigrant molecules from extracellular microenvironment to intracellular region, so it is named lipid raft. 29 Lipid raft plays a critical role in signal transduction and protein trafficking. It is also important to establish cell polarity. 19, 20 In this study, we focused on the effect of lipid raft on virus cell entry. Nystatin is an antifungal medication and can bond cholesterol very well, it is also used in the study of lipid raft. 21 After been treated with nystatin, the hMPV infection rate was also decreased in 16HBE cells.",

H, Exogenous cholesterol had no change on viral load when the virus had entered cells. CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; hMPV, human metapneumovirus; M\u03b2CD, methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin Although hMPV was discovered almost two decades, its infectious mechanism is almost dimness and most studies focused on its epidemiology and clinical manifestation. It is still unclear how hMPV enters host cells. The virus cell entry is the key step of an effective infection. hMPV is the one of the enveloped virus and for those enveloped viruses, membrane fusion is the most common way. But endocytosis way was discovered during viral entry of many enveloped viruses (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] coronavirus).26 For all enveloped viruses, the viral membrane must fuse with cellular membrane or organelle membrane to accomplish infection. These fusion events are considered occur at the cell membrane, therefore, hMPV is regarded as that enters host cells via membrane fusion.",

            "text": "Lipid raft is a specialized membrane microdomain that contains glycosphingolipids and lipoglycoproteins. It is rich in cholesterol, the content of cholesterol in lipid raft is about three to five fold compared with other structure in the cellular membrane. Cholesterol is the key element to maintain lipid raft to keep intact form, so cholesterol depletion could destroy lipid rafts on the surface of cell membrane. Lipid rafts are thought to be involved in the process of HIV invasion of macrophages cells because of cholesterol depletion by M\u03b2CD could reduce the infection of HIV, and HIV receptors were found at detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs).21 Lipid rafts are important to influenza virus assembly and budding.30 The study of influenza virus found that transmembrane glycoprotein, hemagglutinin, and neuronal ammonia were abundant in the DRMs in the process of influenza virus translation. Besides, influenza virus nucleoprotein could target specifically the apical surface. Because lipid rafts play an important role in virus entry, assembly, and budding, so we have tried to explore the role of lipid rafts in the process of hMPV cell entry.In this study, the possibility of lipid rafts associating with the process of hMPV cell entry was verified by the morphological study.CTB subunit is a protein which enters cells via lipid rafts. 24 Laser scanning confocal microscope was used to observe fluorescence labeled CTB and hMPV. The colocalization of CTB and hMPV was universal in 16HBE cells, and the colocalization number increased gradually. Morphological research showed a dynamic process of hMPV cell entry. At first, only little colocating points were found at 0 minute, and then some colocating points were concentrated on the surface of cell membrane at 30 minutes. At last, most of these colocating points appear at the site away from the cell membrane at 60 and 120 minutes, hMPV colocalized with lipid rafts moved gradually toward the nucleus with the lipid rafts. This indicated that lipid rafts participate in the transport of hMPV during the process of endocytosis. Since lipid rafts could be associated with hMPV cell entry, we wonder whether cholesterol depletion could affect hMPV infection. So, M\u03b2CD were used to deplete cholesterol in our study. M\u03b2CD were most commonly used to deplete cholesterol from cell membrane in the studies of lipid rafts. 31 In our study, we also used M\u03b2CD to remove cholesterol and the results here showed that M\u03b2CD can reduce cholesterol in treated cells significantly with dose-dependent. After excluding the influence of cell viability, it is considered that M\u03b2CD significant decreased hMPV infection through reducing cholesterol and destroying lipid raft microdomain. To further verify this, we treated 16HBE cells with M\u03b2CD following by adding exogenous soluble cholesterol into the culture system. When exogenous cholesterol was added, the replication rate of hMPV was recovered. This result showed that lipid raft played an important role in hMPV infection. As a pharmacological agent, M\u03b2CD has a pleiotropic effect. In addition, to deplete cholesterol from the plasma membrane, M\u03b2CD can also inhibit Ca 2+ entry channels. Besides, it also plays an important role in cell proliferation. Inhibiting the Ca 2+ entry channels can reduce virus infection and the cholesterol concentration does not affect in the process. 32 To exclude this effect of M\u03b2CD, we choose another cholesterol chelating-agent-nystatin to verify our results.",

The addition of exogenous cholesterol can recover hMPV infection. Therefore, our results suggest that lipid rafts play an important role in the process of hMPV cell entry. These results have given a better understanding of the mechanisms of hMPV entry and a new way to prevent and treat virus infection.",
