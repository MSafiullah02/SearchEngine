By keeping their animals healthy, and by using dedicated methods of food preparation and conservation, ancient farmers learned how to improve health and prevent disease. Probably the oldest written document about it is \u2018On Airs, Waters, and Places\u2019, written by Hippocrates,1 which describes how human health is influenced by its interaction with the environment. Since then, our health situation has improved by applying these simple rules of thumb, and even more through improved technologies such as good animal management, hygiene and biosecurity, vaccination programs and prudent animal drug treatment. Nowadays, some of the most feared zoonotic diseases such as anthrax or brucellosis are absent in many countries. However, there are still many important diseases that threaten human health and which have animals as their reservoir. These animal reservoirs range from wildlife to domestic animals, both in companionship and agricultural settings. By the obvious close contact and the sheer number of animals needed for consumption, the animals produced for food form the largest reservoir and production grounds for emerging zoonotic pathogens.",

            "text": "Actions of authorities to protect society from zoonotic diseases differ significantly according to socio-economic status and the zoonotic pathogen in question. Basically, zoonotic diseases related to food animals can be separated into three groups. In the first group are diseases with a potential for global spread and with a dramatic public relations potential, often these diseases have a significant human reservoir showing human-human transmission, e.g. SARS, avian influenza and certain types of AMR bacteria. The second group is constituted by persistent zoonotic diseases related to the industrialized food production chain, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, which are broadly distributed in the farm-to-fork chain. These human pathogens are often non-pathogenic in animals and seem to be distributed in all countries, both rich and poor. In the third group are the \u2018neglected zoonotic diseases\u2019. They are zoonotic diseases which have been eradicated (or drastically reduced) in affluent economies through vaccination and culling policies, and through introduction of hygienic and animal biosafety management practices. However, in many poor settings these diseases are \u2018neglected diseases\u2019 and receive very little attention from national authorities or even international organizations. This group includes Brucella, bovine TB (tuberculosis), i.e. Mycobacterium bovis, and many parasitic diseases, e.g. leishmaniasis and cysticercosis. In addition to these traditional infectious diseases there is a new threat of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria. Caused by the use of antimicrobials both in human and veterinary medicine this problem has emerged and is now to be recognized as one of the most important threats to human health.",

            "text": "Through food and feed, direct contact, and via the environment, the human- and the animal microbial flora are in contact with each other. Figure 10.1 outlines the most important routes of transmission for infectious diseases between humans and animals. Via these routes infectious diseases from (food-)animals may enter the human reservoir and vice versa. The foodborne transmission route is probably the most important gateway for this contact, and the vast majority of human infections with enteric zoonotic bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, and Yersinia enterocolitica, occur through this route. For other diseases there is evidence that transmission also occurs via direct contact between (food) animal and humans, e.g. live-stock associated methicillin resistant Staphlylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Graveland et al. 2011). Next, there is transmission via the environment (e.g. surface water or water used to irrigate plants) mainly as a result of spreading of manure into the environment (Spencer and Guan 2004; Hutchison et al. 2005). And though much less frequently reported, there may be transmission of pathogens from humans to animals, which most probably was the case for the Staphylococcus aureus CC398 (Price et al. 2012). In many developing countries, wildlife forms an additional important reservoir for foodborne pathogens, not only through consumption of wildlife. Because of often lower bio-safety levels in these countries, direct contact between humans and food animals is generally more frequent, and diseases from the wildlife community may cross over more easily to domestic animals. For instance, the general understanding now is that the SARS epidemic in 2003 originated in direct human contact with and/or consumption of wildlife, or indirectly through contact between wildlife and domestic animals (Guan et al. 2003; Shi and Hu 2008).\n",

Outbreaks of viral diseases in humans, originating in or spreading through farm animals (avian flu\u2014H5N1 and swine flu\u2014H1N1) have caused major global alerts in the last decade. These influenza outbreaks spread very quickly, either in the animal population (H5N1) or directly in the human population (H1N1), and formed a global threat for human health. H1N1 was therefore characterized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. Although in total the human disease burden related to the endemic bacterial zoonoses is probably many fold higher than these influenza outbreaks, it is basically these relatively few but fast spreading outbreaks that have put One Health on the global agenda. In addition, the failure to predict, monitor and control the spread of these diseases in animals presented regulators and politicians with a wake-up call, and made them demand (better) cross-sectoral collaboration between the animal and human health sectors.",

The most well-known zoonotic prion disease is probably the one causing Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cows, and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, as represented by the massive outbreak of \u2018Mad Cow Disease\u2019 in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s. This agent, a mutant protein, which mainly sits in the brain, got into the (beef) food chain by the feeding of ruminant derived meat and bone meal to ruminants. Prions (Prusiner 1997), Scrapie (the disease in goats), spongiform encephalopathy of Rocky Mountain elk, transmissible mink encephalopathy, kuru and Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease were known before the large outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the UK. It, however, took some time and great efforts, and an early One Health approach, to establish the links between the different animal diseases and the human disease (Hill et al. 1997; Prusiner 1998; Ghani et al. 1998). This insight created a background to efficiently stop the spread of this prion disease, by banning the use of animals in animal feed, and seeing a subsequent decrease of the disease in humans (Hoinville 1994).",

However, they do form a serious threat to the vulnerable segments of our societies (i.e. the young, the elderly, the immune-compromised and recovering patients), and some patients may develop long-lasting chronic disorders (e.g. arthritis and neurological disorders) (McKenna 2012). These facts, together with the sheer number of infections they cause, results in a substantial total burden of disease for these pathogens as expressed in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) (see Murray 1994). For instance, the study of Havelaar et al. (2012) showed that the total burden of the 14 diseases he studied was 13,500 DALYs, for a total of 1.8 million cases and 233 deaths caused by these diseases (in 16 million people). Source attribution estimates showed that one-third could be attributed to foodborne transmission. Similarly large numbers were reported for the USA (CDC 2011), where surveillance studies of 31 known pathogens gave an estimated total of 9.4 million illnesses, 55,961 hospitalization and 1,351 deaths attributed to foodborne diseases (in 315 million people). Importantly, the latter report also showed that the 31 pathogens studied make up only 44 % of the foodborne diseases, and the majority of 56 % is caused by unknown agents. This situation is probably not unique for the USA, and thus indicates that there is still much health to be gained from improved food safety. Table 10.1 shows that an almost identical list of important foodborne pathogens are found in Europe, and that Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter, rotaviruses, noroviruses and Salmonella, should probably form the key targets for interventions. Except for norovirus, these pathogens have been shown to be zoonotic, and find their way to humans via food and the environment (Fig. 10.1). A One Health approach ensuring efficient cross-sectoral collaboration and data-sharing, could lay the foundation for a realistic description of the situation, and could help implement sensible cross-sector solutions.",

This is typically done through the construction of zoonosis centers or their equivalents. These centers aim to stimulate and facilitate the collaboration between human, veterinary and food institutes. Some examples of such specialized centers are the US National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid), the British National Centre for Zoonosis Research (http://www.zoonosis.ac.uk/zoonosis) and Danish Zoonosis Centre which is part of the Danish National Food Institute (http://www.food.dtu.dk/English/Research/Research_Groups/Zoonosis_Centre.aspx). Two clear examples of what such centers can accomplish are: the reduction of Salmonella in food animals in Denmark, and the Danish integrated approach to combat AMR (described below in a separate section). In the Danish Salmonella reduction program, data sharing across animal, food and human health sectors has enabled science-based solutions, and has most noticeably resulted in significant reductions in human salmonellosis through lowering Salmonella prevalence in animals (Wegener et al. 2003). In relation to laying hens the program started with a simple and inexpensive serological surveillance of egg producers. Flocks found positive were either culled and repopulated, or used to produce heat-processed eggs, Danish eggs are now considered free of Salmonella. Next to this arm, a program of surveillance and eradication of infected broiler flocks was setup. The effect of the whole program was measured in term of cases of human salmonellosis, which were found to be significantly reduced as the project progressed in time.",

Salmonella entered the country through import of infected poultry in the commercial national production system around 1993, and thereafter spread quickly to the communal sector (small-scale farming), as well as to the human population (Matope et al. 1998). The most likely reason for the spread within Zimbabwe was that old animals from the commercial sector were sold to small-scale communal production systems. As the trade of live animals is done on a global level and does not take into account whether the traded animals carry any of the diseases from Table 10.1, reducing the prevalence in the commercial sector in producing countries, may also lower the global spread and human disease burden in the rest of the world.",

This is the reason why the WHO refers to these diseases as \u2018Neglected Diseases\u2019 (WHO 2006; Molyneux et al. 2011). Neglected diseases may be categorized into two (strongly overlapping) categories. In the first category are the neglected tropical diseases which include Chagas disease, trypanosomiasis, leprosy, rabies, schistosomiasis and others, many of which are zoonotic and parasitic diseases.2 The second category are the neglected zoonotic diseases, covering many of the diseases above and also some bacterial diseases such as anthrax, bovine tuberculosis (TB), brucellosis, and also cysticercosis and echinococcosis.3\n",

In particular, the prevalence of bovine TB appears to be increasing in many poor settings and has been linked to HIV infections as an important factor for progression of a TB infection to an active TB disease (LoBue et al. 2010). Brucellosis and bovine TB in cattle cause lowered productivity in the animal population, but seldom death, and both have largely been eradicated from the bovine population in the developed world by test-and-slaughter programs, which in effect has eliminated the human health problem (Godfroid and K\u00e4sbohrer 2002).",

Humans acquire Taenia solium tapeworms when eating raw or undercooked pork contaminated with cysticerci. The route of transmission is, pigs infected through Taenia eggs shed in human faeces, and the disease is thus strongly associated with pigs raised under poor hygienic conditions. This means that the cycle of infection can be relatively easily broken by introducing efficient animal management, as has been done in most developed countries.",

The success in humans led to their introduction in veterinary medicine in the 1950s, where they were used in both production and companion animals. Nowadays, antibiotics are also used with intensive fish farming and to control some infectious diseases in plants. Their use is thus widespread. Antibiotics in animals are mainly used in three ways: (1) for therapy of individual cases, (2) for disease prevention (prophylaxis) treating groups of animals, and (3) as antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) treating groups of healthy animals with sub-therapeutic concentrations to promote animal growth. When first introduced, the use of antibiotics led to improved animal health, and subsequently higher levels of both food safety and food security. All use, but in particular the use as AGP, resulted in a dramatic rise in the use of antibiotics, and for instance, between 1951 and 1978 the use in the United States alone went from 110 to 5,580 t (WHO 2011).",

Notably a number of bacterial strains that were previously susceptible to antibiotics are now in very high frequencies becoming resistant to various antibiotics, some of which are very important as last resort treatment potential for humans (Bonten et al. 2001). In particular the use as AGP is questionable, as the concentrations used are sub-therapeutic which result in the selection for resistance but do not efficiently kill microorganisms. Nowadays there are serious efforts by national authorities and some international organizations to reduce the antibiotic overuse in animals (Food Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)/WHO 2003; WHO 2011; U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (2012)), especially\u2014but not only\u2014through abolishing their use as AGP. However, there seem to be major problems in ensuring cross-sectoral understanding, since the veterinary and medical professions are still in debate about how the AMR problem has emerged (Phillips et al. 2004; Karp and Engberg 2004; Smith et al. 2005; Price et al. 2012). To achieve a science-based understanding of the problem, data on AMR from both the animal and the human side should be compared, and both risk assessments and source attributions performed in an integrated way. In other words, a One Health approach in which human and animal health sectors, including food and environmental sectors, work together, may help to deliver answers needed and suggest ways to reduce problems in both human and animal reservoirs (Figs. 10.1 and 10.2).",

They examine the prevalence of zoonotic diseases in humans and (food-)animals, their routes of transmission, the risk associated with their presence in our food chain, and the relation between human disease and zoonotic transmission. In addition, as our food production system has become increasingly dependent on global trade, the approaches taken by these zoonoses centers (should) also include a global angle. National zoonosis centers may also help tackle the global problems associated with zoonotic diseases.",

The three major principles are:Use of antimicrobials for prevention of disease can only be justified where it can be shown that a particular disease is present on the premises or is likely to occur. The routine prophylactic use of antimicrobials should never be a substitute for good animal health management.Prophylactic use of antimicrobials in control programs should be regularly assessed for effectiveness and whether use can be reduced or stopped. Efforts to prevent disease should continuously be in place aiming at reducing the need for the prophylactic use of antimicrobials.Use of antimicrobial growth promoters that belong to classes of antimicrobial agents used (or submitted for approval) in humans and animals should be terminated or rapidly phased-out in the absence of risk-based evaluations.\n",

In 1995, after publication of the finding that 80 % of Enterococci in all industrial produced chickens in Denmark were highly resistant to vancomycin (a last resort drug for human therapy) the government decided that actions had to be taken (Wegener et al. 2003) and set up the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and Research Program (DANMAP).

On the one hand food should be nutritious and adding to one\u2019s health. On the other hand most food is commercially produced and traded. As food is a commercial product, one of the ways to make food producers (the supply-side) produce more healthy food, is if the public demands this (the supply\u2013demand balance). Therefore, educating the public to buy healthier food may be a way to make food manufacturers produce healthier food. Next, there are other stakeholders and fields of science (e.g. industrial sciences or logistics) and policy (e.g. economics) that contribute to the food chain, but which may focus on other aspects than healthy food alone, and their conclusions may conflict with the food safety principles (e.g. the use of AGP to improve animal growth).",

Findings should be shared and compared with the findings in human medicine, to be able to make decisions about potential risks for human health. Thus the animal, food and human sectors need working together, to collect and to share data in such a way that they may be compared. As there are still many different techniques used in all three fields, it is still difficult to compare data. An important development in infectious disease diagnostics will be the introduction of WGS techniques, and the construction of a global, open-access genomic database for microorganisms. In a One Health manner, the latter would take diagnostics to a new level, and will greatly improve human, animal and food safety.",
