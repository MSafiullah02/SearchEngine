Based on this previous work, in addition to the two above conditions (for comparison purposes), we built (c) a paragraph-level index as follows: each full text article is segmented into paragraphs (based on existing annotations), and for each paragraph, we create a \"document\" for indexing comprising the title, abstract, and that paragraph. Thus, a full-text article comprising n paragraphs yields n + 1 separate \"retrievable units\" in the index. To be consistent with standard IR parlance, we call each of these retrieval units a document, in a generic sense, despite their composite structure. An article for which we do not have the full text is represented by an individual document in this scheme. Note that while fielded search (dividing the text into separate fields and performing scoring separately for each field) can yield better results, for expediency we did not implement this. Following best practice, documents are ranked using the BM25 scoring function.",

We used BioBERT to convert sentences from the retrieved candidates and the query (which we treat as a sequence of keywords) into sets of hidden vectors. 7 We compute the cosine similarity between every combination of hidden states from the two sets, corresponding to a sentence and the query. We choose the top-K words in the context, and then highlight the top sentences that contain those words. Despite its unsupervised nature, this approach appeared to accurately identify pertinent sentences based on context. Originally meant as a simple demonstration of how keyword search can be seamlessly integrated with neural network components, this notebook provided the basic approach for sentence highlighting that we would eventually deploy in the Neural Covidex (details below).",

As Solr is also built on Lucene, such integration was not very onerous. On top of Solr, we were able to deploy the Blacklight search interface, 8 which is an application written in Ruby on Rails. In addition to providing basic support for query entry and results rendering, Blacklight also supports faceted browsing out of the box. With this combination-which had already been implemented for other corporaour team was able to rapidly create a fully-featured search application on CORD-19, which we shared with the public on March 23 over social media. 9 A screenshot of this interface is shown in Figure 1 . Beyond standard \"type in a query and get back a list of results\" capabilities, it is worthwhile to highlight the faceted browsing feature. From CORD-19, we were able to easily expose facets corresponding to year, authors, journal, and source. Navigating by year, for example, would allow a user to focus on older coronavirus research (e.g., on SARS) or the latest research on COVID-19, and a combination of the journal and source facets would allow a user to differentiate between pre-prints and the peer-reviewed literature, and between venues with different reputations. 8 https://projectblacklight.org/ 9 https://twitter.com/lintool/status/ 1242085391123066880",

To address this issue, we first segment each document into spans by applying a sliding window of 10 sentences with a stride of 5. We then obtain a probability of relevance for each span by performing inference on it independently. We select the highest probability among these spans as the relevance probability of the document. Note that with the paragraph index, keyword search might retrieve multiple paragraphs from the same underlying article; our technique essentially takes the highest-scoring span across all these retrieved results as the score for that article to produce a final ranking of articles.

The Allen Institute for AI deserves tremendous credit for their tireless efforts in curating the articles, incrementally expanding the corpus, and continuously improve the data quality (data cleaning, as we all know, is 80% of data science). The rapid recent advances in neural architectures for NLP largely come from transformers that have been pretrained with language modeling objectives. Pretraining, of course, requires enormous amounts of hardware resources, and the fact that our community has developed an open culture where these models are freely shared has broadened and accelerated advances tremendously. We are beneficiaries of this sharing. Pretrained models then need to be fine-tuned for the actual downstream task, and for search-related tasks, the single biggest driver of recent progress has been Microsoft's release of the MS MARCO datatset (Nguyen et al., 2016) . Without exaggeration, much of our recent work would not exist with this treasure trove.",

This is especially true of the \"foundational\" components at the bottom of our stack: Anserini has been in development for several years, with an emphasis on providing easily replicable and reusable keyword search capabilities. The Pyserini interface to Anserini had also been in development since late 2019, providing a clean Python interface to Anserini. While the ability to rapidly explore new research ideas is important, investments in software engineering best practices are worthwhile and pay large dividends in the long run.",

Refactoring research code into software artifacts that have at least some semblance of interface abstractions for reusability, writing good documentation to aid replication efforts, and other thankless tasks consume enormous amounts of effort-and without a faculty advisor's strong insistence, often never happens. Ultimately, we feel this is a matter of the \"culture\" of a research group-and cannot be instilled overnight-but our team's rapid progress illustrates that building such cultural norms is worthwhile.",

If we were simply running experiments for a research paper, this would not be a concern, since evaluations could be conducted in batch, and we would not be concerned with how long inference took to generate the results. However, in a live system, both latency (where we test the patience of an individual user) and throughput (which dictates how many concurrent users we could serve) are critical. Even after the initial implementation of the Neural Covidex had been completed-and we had informally shared the system with colleagues-it required several more days of effort until we were reasonably confident that we could handle a public release, with potentially concurrent usage. During this time, we focused on issues such as hardware provisioning, load balancing, load testing, deploy processes, and other important operational concerns. Researchers simply wishing to write papers need not worry about any of these issues.",

Also, we had minor issues with the highlighting service, in that sometimes the highlights did not align perfectly with the underlying sentences. These were no doubt relatively trivial matters of software engineering, but in initial informal evaluations, users kept mentioning these imperfections over and over again-to the extent, we suspect, that it was distracting them from considering the underlying quality of the ranking. Once again, these were issues that would have never cropped up if our end goal was to simply write research papers, not deploy a live system to serve users.",
