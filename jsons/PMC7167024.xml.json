One patient presented with acute flaccid paralysis. She was a 3\u2010year\u2010old girl who had an episode of acute gastroenteritis. Six days later, she was admitted to hospital with fever, rhinopharyngitis, and acute flaccid paralysis of the left leg. Cerebrospinal fluid showed pleiocytosis (165 leucocytes/mm3) with normal protein and glucose levels. Acute respiratory distress and paraplegia occurred 2 days afterward. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed myelitis. Spontaneous mobility of the superior limbs and the right inferior limb had recovered at 1 year follow\u2010up. However, the patient still suffered from chronic respiratory insufficiency necessitating mechanical ventilation at follow\u2010up after 19 months.",

Among them, seven were EV\u2010D68\u2010positive, eight were HRV\u2010positive, and two were identified as echoviruses. The existence of a high number of HRV and EV types with considerable genomic variability represents a challenge for diagnostic assays and it is conceivable that any diagnostic assay will not be able to detect all HRV and EV types with the same sensitivity. Importantly, EV\u2010D68 is not detected at all by this multiplex RT\u2010PCR for respiratory viruses because even undiluted supernatant of an EV\u2010D68 Fermon strain culture with a TCID50/mL of 3.16 \u00d7 106 yielded negative results (data not shown). This confirms the findings of a recent publication.5 We therefore, changed our diagnostic algorithm to include testing of specimens that yield negative results in the multiplex RT\u2010PCR for respiratory viruses in our EV\u2010specific RT\u2010PCR. This approach may delay the diagnosis of EV\u2010D68 infections and thus the detection of an outbreak of respiratory infections associated with this emergent type. There is clearly a need for evaluation and update of commercial multiplex RT\u2010PCR assays for respiratory viruses to include the detection and the identification of EV\u2010D68.",

However, the CSF and a blood specimen tested positive for Epstein\u2010Barr virus (EBV) with a viral load of 2300 copies/mL in the blood. In the cases of acute neurological illnesses described recently only one case had EV\u2010D68 detected in blood, whereas EV\u2010D68 was typically detected in respiratory specimens. Nevertheless, the authors concluded on a possible causal association of EV\u2010D68 with myelitis.14, 15, 16, 17 Therefore, the findings in our case do not contradict the association of EV\u2010D68 with myelitis. However, taking into account the weakly positive EBV PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid, the myelitis might also be due to EBV infection.",
