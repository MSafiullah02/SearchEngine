Smallpox has several attributes that make it a potential threat. It can be grown in large amounts. It spreads via the respiratory route. It has a 30% mortality rate. The potential for an attack using smallpox motivated President Bush to call for phased vaccination of a substantial number of American health care and public health workers (Grabenstein and Winkenwerder, 2003; Stevenson and Stolberg, 2002). Following September 11, 2001, the United States rebuilt its supplies of vaccine and Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG), expanded the network of laboratories capable of testing for variola virus, and engaged in a broad education campaign to help health care workers and the general public understand the disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003a). This chapter summarizes the scientific and theoretical bases for use of smallpox as a bioweapon and options for preparation for defense against it.",

This work shows that the genes of orthopox viruses are amenable to deletions and additions. Researchers working with ectromelia (mousepox), another close cousin of variola, have created a very virulent strain, able to escape the protective effect of prior immunization with vaccinia (Born et al., 2000; Jackson et al., 2001). Recent research suggests that smallpox virus could be recreated by synthesizing long strands of DNA, thus enhancing its availability for bioterrorism. The viral genome has been deposited in public databases, making such work possible although time-consuming and highly technical (Wade, 2005).",

Subsequent work with rabbitpox and monkeypox, orthopoxes that also cause species-specific systemic disease, have refined our understanding of pathogenesis (Fenner et al., 1988). Infection is via the respiratory route. During the first 4 or 5 days after infection, the virus multiplies in the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract. It is then released into the bloodstream in a primary (asymptomatic) viremia. This viremia is cleared by the reticuloendothelial system, where the virus again multiplies. About 8 or 9 days after the initial infection, the reticu-loendothelial cells release a secondary viremia, which is probably cell-associated. This is a massive viremia that causes an intense and prostrating prodrome, with fever, myalgias, and other symptoms of a vigorous viremia. The secondary viremia is cleared toward the end of the prodrome, when the leukocyte-associated virus becomes localized in small blood vessels in the dermis and upper respiratory epithelium.",

The fluid from vesicles and pustules and scabs is infectious, and virus can be isolated from scabs (Breman and Henderson, 2002; Fenner et al., 1988). The main source of natural infection is the secretions from the upper respiratory tract, where lesions quickly break down and excrete virus because the epithelium in the nose and throat lacks the firm keratinized layer that seals in the virus in the lesions on the skin. Patients are therefore infectious from about 12\u201324 hours before the initial faint macular rash appears on the skin, and remain infectious throughout the course of the rash (Breman and Henderson, 2002; Dixon, 1962; Fenner et al., 1988).",

Vaccine-modified smallpox can be very mild and nonfatal, although if vaccination was more than 20 years prior to exposure, the fatality rate is not trivial and patients can still transmit the disease. As lesions become denser and confluent, the fatality rate increases, the amount of virus in the respiratory secretions increases, and patients are more infectious (Fenner et al., 1988; Mack, 1972; Rao, 1972). Hemorrhagic smallpox has a fatality rate of nearly 100%, and patients are highly infectious. About 1\u20135% of unvaccinated patients with V. majorget hemorrhagic smallpox, probably with disseminated intravascular coagulation (Bray and Buller, 2004; McKenzie et al., 1965; Rao, 1972). They are usually very sick, usually unable to get out of bed and thus may not transmit efficiently. The clinical presentation (from mild to discrete to confluent to hem-orrhagic) is a function of the host response, not the virus. The clinical types do not breed true, in that transmission from any patient can give rise to any of the clinical presentations, and the virus is the same.",

This method is also sometimes called \u201cring vaccination\u201d. C.W. Dixon describes, in his once-definitive textbook on smallpox (1962), how he used \u201cexpanding ring\u201d vaccination to control a smallpox epidemic in North Africa after World War II. Vaccine supplies and workers were in short supply, so mass vaccination was impractical. The identification of patients and vaccination of their contacts was his first priority. The next was vaccinating people living in tents surrounding the infected family. Finally, an entire infected village was vaccinated if time and vaccine supply permitted (Dixon, 1948). This concept formed the basis of the surveillance and containment method, after Foege and his colleagues made similar observations about the ease of controlling smallpox by vaccinating close contacts in West Africa in 1967\u20131968 (Foege et al., 1971; Foege et al., 1975). Surveillance and containment methods work well, even in large and geographically extensive outbreaks, such as that which occurred among several tens of millions of people in the Ganges floodplain in 1974 (Fenner et al., 1988). It is the method that eradicated smallpox when 150 years of mass vaccination failed.",

If the diagnosis is suspected, modern infection control procedures and effective isolation should virtually eliminate nosocomial transmission. Early in a bioterrorist attack, if smallpox is not high on most clinicians' index of suspicion, cases may be missed and transmit the disease before being effectively isolated. Most hospitals have procedures to isolate patients with fever and an undiagnosed rash to reduce nosocomial transmission of measles and chickenpox, but these procedures may be difficult to implement in a large, busy city emergency ward.",

Such strains could devastate developing countries with poor public health systems, and a widespread outbreak would quickly spread to such countries (Johnson et al., 2003). Natural smallpox could similarly boomerang. Terrorists with the ability to manufacture it would realize that an effective attack might cause widespread disease in nations harboring their colleagues.

In June 2002, the ACIP recommended that vaccine be made available to selected state and local officials with responsibility for protection of public health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2002d). This was consistent with CDC's plan for containment of a smallpox attack and coincided with proof that the 15 million doses of vaccine could be diluted 1:5 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002d; Frey et al., 2002), that additional vaccine was on hand, and that production of new vaccine was well under way.",

Public announcements suggested vaccinating considerable numbers of health care workers, particularly in big city emergency wards and other areas where initially undiagnosed smallpox cases might seek medical care. Many states sought to revaccinate predominantly older workers who had a past history of vaccination, because the residual immunity in such revaccinees is not trivial, and they are less likely to experience adverse events after vaccination (Hammarlund et al., 2003). The number of health care workers in big city hospitals is large, and they turn over rapidly. Many health care workers vaccinated under such a policy are in frequent contact with patients with HIV, status postorgan transplants, atopic dermatitis, etc. Given the recent data (Frey et al., 2002) that adults given primary vaccination frequently need to take one or more days off work because of fever and malaise, many hospitals expressed concern about the effects of widespread vaccination (Connolly, 2003; Gettleman, 2002). Other \u201cfirst responders\u201d\u2014including policemen, firemen, ambulance workers, and other emergency medical personnel\u2014should be considered for preevent vaccination (Bush, 2002; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003g; Stevenson and Altman, 2002). In part reflecting these concerns, in August 2003 the Institute of Medicine recommended shifting emphasis away from vaccinations to focus on measures to improve coordination and quicken response time to any public health threat (Olson, 2003).",
