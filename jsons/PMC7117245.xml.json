            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is animal virus belonging to family coronaviridae (Annamaria, 2011). According to present virus taxonomy of ICTV (international committee of taxonomy viruses), the coronaviridae family comprises the subfamily coronavirinae and torovirinae. The subfamily coronavirinae is classified into genera alpha-, beta- and gammacoronavirus, instead of phylogroups 1 through 3 (Annamaria, 2011, Carstens, 2010). TGEV, together with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), canine coronaviruses (CCoVs), feline coronavirus (FCoV), belongs to alphacoronavirus (Annamaria, 2011, Carstens, 2010). In phylogenetic analyses of the genomic region downstream of the S gene, TGEV consistently clusters with extant CCoV-II field strains, suggesting that TGEV is likely to be of canine coronavirus origin (Lorusso et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2007). Like other coronaviruses, TGEV is an enveloped virus that contains a large, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (Eleouet et al., 1998). TGEV replicates in enterocytes and provokes villous atrophy, resulting in lethal watery diarrhea and dehydration in piglets, which is considered to be a central event in the pathogenesis of TGEV infection (Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1993). In consistent with in vivo pathologic changes, TGEV also induces cytopathic effects (CPE) when propagated in vitro cultured cells (Eleouet et al., 1998, Solorzano et al., 1978). Further studies have demonstrated that TGEV infection caused CPE in swine testis (ST) cells by induction of apoptosis (Eleouet et al., 1998, Kim et al., 2000, Sirinarumitr et al., 1998). However, the exact molecular pathways of TGEV-induced apoptosis are not clear.",

To test whether Bid is involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis, we measured the changes of Bid in cells upon TGEV infection. Western blot analysis revealed that tBid appeared in mitochondrial fractions at 8 h p.i., and maintained a high level in subsequent times in TGEV-infected cells but not in mock-infected cells (Fig. 3D). However, following incubation with z-IETD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase-8, tBid could not be detected in TGEV-infected cells (Fig. 3E). Moreover, the activation of caspase-9 was partly blocked in TGEV-infected cells in the presence of caspase-8 inhibitor compared to that in cells without the inhibitor (Fig. 3F), suggesting that block of caspase-8 activity could affect Bid cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Take together, these results suggest that apoptosis signals from the FasL are transmitted to activate caspase-8, which in turn cleaves Bid, activates mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, followed by caspase-9 activation, and that other apoptosis signals might contribute to the activation of caspase-9.",

In TGEV-infected PK-15 cells, the activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 and cleavage of PARP were observed, while inhibition of these caspases activities significantly attenuated the apoptotic effects of TGEV infection.

            "text": "There are two main signaling pathways contributing to caspases activation, death receptor and mitochondrial pathways. Death receptor pathway is initiated by death receptor ligation followed by recruitment of adaptor molecules and activation of upstream caspases (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998). Mitochondrial pathway is dependent on the process of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to the release of toxic proteins from mitochondria, which is subject to the regulation by Bcl-2 family proteins (Shimizu et al., 1999). Fas/FasL-mediated signaling has been reported in apoptosis in response to infection of several viruses such as Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) (Lin et al., 2009) and murine coronavirus (Liu and Zhang, 2007). Our current study revealed that the induction of apoptosis by TGEV infection was preceded by increased expression of FasL, which was followed by subsequent activation of caspase-8 and -3. This finding demonstrates that caspase-8 activation in TGEV-infected cells can be mediated by ligation of Fas and FasL. Mitochondrial apoptotic signals are controlled prominently by the Bcl-2 family proteins, which include a number of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins to regulate apoptosis progress by changing relative levels (Shimizu et al., 1999). Some viruses can encode proteins homologous to Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis, while some viruses can induce apoptosis by modulating the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins (Cheng et al., 1997, De Martino et al., 2010, Umeshappa et al., 2010). Our results showed that TGEV infection down-regulated Bcl-2, up-regulated Bax expression, promoted Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria, and induced the release of cytochrome c, resulting in PK-15 cell apoptosis. These results are consistent with the observation in murine and canine coronaviruses (Chen and Makino, 2002, De Martino et al., 2010), suggesting that modulation of Bcl-2 members might be a key step for coronaviruses induction of CPE and eventually cell death.",

Our results also provided evidences for the potential crosstalk between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in TGEV-induced apoptosis. Blocking caspase-8 activity using z-IETD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase-8, did not completely abrogate caspase-9 activation, suggesting that caspase-9 is activated not only by caspase-8 activation but also by other upstream apoptotic signals.

            "text": "Some viruses can trigger apoptosis by early steps of virus infectious cycle in the absence of viral replication, such as vesicular stomatitis virus and reovirus (Clarke et al., 2000, Gadaleta et al., 2002). However, some other viruses-induced apoptosis depends on viral replication, such as BEFV and human cytomegalovirus (Lin et al., 2009, Reboredo et al., 2004). Our results showed that inhibition of virus uncoating prevented the occurrence of apoptosis and that UV-inactivated TGEV lost the ability to induce apoptosis, suggesting that TGEV-induced cell apoptosis depends on viral replication. Then, we investigated whether caspases activation in cells is required for TGEV replication in cells. Although our results showed that inhibition of caspases activation could increase total viral titer, the increase of viral titer is proportionate with the effects of cell viability increase derived from the inhibition of caspases activation, suggesting that block of caspases activation does not affect TGEV replication in fact. All these findings suggest that viral replication is crucial for the induction of apoptosis in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells.",
