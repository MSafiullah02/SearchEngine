Three days later, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 20 min with ice-cold methanol at -20\u00b0C and washed three times with PBS.The viral protein NS5A was detected with a 1:1000 dilution of mAb 9E10(15) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 o C. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and a peroxidase-conjugated antibody specific to murine IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted at 1:200 in PBS was added to each well. Following 1 h incubation at room temperature, peroxidase activity was detected by incubating cells with 0.32% (w/v) of 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) in N,Ndimethylformamide diluted at a ratio of 1:3.3 with 15 mM acetic acid, 35mM sodium acetate, pH 8.0, and 0.4% H 2 O 2 . Cells were incubated for 10-30 minutes at room temperature, the carbazole substrate was removed and water was added. The 50% tissue culture dose was calculated by the method of Spearman and K\u00e4rber.Indirect immunofluorescence: Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 minutes. The NS5A protein was detected by incubation with mouse monoclonal E9E10 antibody diluted 1:2000 in PBS and supplemented with 5% goat serum (Sigma), for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and a secondary antibody specific for murine IgG conjugated with Alexa-Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:1000 was added to the cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were counter-stained for 1 minute at room temperature with DAPI (Invitrogen) diluted 1:3000.Matrigel polarization, DiD-HCV preparation and imagingHuh-7.5 cells were trypsinized and diluted in DMEM + 10% FBS to a final concentration of 1 x10 5 cells/mL. Equal volumes of thawed Matrigel (Growth Factor Reduced, Phenol Red-free; BD Biosciences) and diluted cells were combined and seeded onto coverslips in 24-well plates (75 \u00b5L/well). The cell-Matrigel solution was allowed to polymerize for 30 minutes at 37 o C before adding DMEM + 10% FBS. Cells were grown for 7 days, changing media every other day. Viral stocks were concentrated via PEG (polyethylene glycol 8000; Fisher) precipitation (Blight et al., 2002; Coller et al., 2009), then resuspended in serum free media. One mL of concentrated virus was incubated with 5 \u00b5L of DiD (Invitrogen) for 90 minutes. Labeled virus was layered onto a 10-60% weight/volume iodixanol gradient (OptiPrep, Sigma) and centrifuged for 16.5 hours (34,000 RPMs at 4 o C). The gradient was then fractionated; each 1 mL fraction was subsequently analyzed for specific infectivity (HCV RNA levels via Trizol-LS extraction, Invitrogen, and infectious virus). Fractions with the best specific infectivity (5.7 \u00b1 3.1) were purified with Amicon Ultra 100k filters (Millipore) and pooled for use in imaging studies. Matrigel-polarized cells were preincubated on ice for 20 minutes. DiD-labeled HCV was added to cells and incubated on ice for an additional hour, then transferred to 37 o C (time of temperature shift: t=0) and fixed at various points after the shift in 3.6% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton x-100 in PBS for 10 minutes, and then washed three times with 0.1 M Glycine in PBS for 10 minutes each. Cells were incubated for 2 hours in blocking solution (Wash buffer: 0.1% BSA, 0.2% Triton x-100, 0.005% Tween-20 in PBS + 20% goat serum). Coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 o C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, rinsed 3 times with wash buffer (as above), then mounted with DAPI prolong gold (Invitrogen). Imaging was performed on an Olympus DSU Spinning Disc Confocal with an 100X NA 1.45 oilimmersion objective. Using Slidebook imaging software, images were captured with a Hamamatsu back thinned EM-CCD camera set to an intensification of 255. DiD-labeled HCV and Alexafluor 594 were visualized with the DsRed filter set; Alexafluor 488 was visualized with the EGFP filter set. Z-stacks of the organoids were acquired using slices taken every 0.3 \u00b5m. Images were quantified for colocalization in ImageJ using RGB profiler (Christophe Laummonerie) and colocalization highlighter. Voxels were calculated using Object Counter 3D. Images presented in the figures were duplicated out of the Z-stack, separated into individual channels, adjusted for contrast and smoothed, then reassembled. Membrane Fluidity assays. DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and cholesterol were dissolved in chloroform to 2.7 \u03bcmol/ml at a molar ratio of 2.7:0 (100% DOPC) or 1.7:1.0 (37% cholesterol -63% DOPC). Lipids were dried by evaporating the solvent in a fume hood overnight and then re-hydrated in 1 ml Na 2 HPO 4 \u2022citric acid buffer (200 mM Na 2 HPO 4 \u2022citric acid, pH 7.4) by vortexing for 3-5 minutes. Re-hydrated lipids were extruded through a polycarbonate membrane (pore size \u22640.2 \u03bcm) using an avanti mini-extruder kit. 1,6-Diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran at a concentration of 2 mM. Liposomes (100% DOPC or 37% cholesterol -67% DOPC) were suspended in Na 2 HPO 4 \u2022citric acid buffer (pH 7.4) and labelled with DPH at a final concentration of 2\u00b5M for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C. DPH-labelled liposomes were treated with the indicated concentrations of curcumin, flunarizine dihydrochloride, pimozide, trifluoperazine dihydrochloride, fluphenazine hydrochloride, or DMSO vehicle for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Treated liposomes were diluted in Na 2 HPO 4 \u2022citric acid buffer (pH 7.4) to 2.5 mL and kept at 37\u00b0C. DPH fluorescence polarization was evaluated at 350 nm excitation and 450 nm emission wavelengths using a QuantaMaster 40 scanning spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ) equipped with a 75-W xenon lamp. Fluorescence polarization (P) was calculated according to the following equation: P = (I VV -G I VH ) / (I VV + G I VH ), where I VV and I VH are the fluorescence intensities with parallel and perpendicular polarization to the excitation beam, respectively, and G is the sensitivity of the fluorimeter detector for vertically relative to horizontally polarized light. To test cholesterol dependence, polarization was expressed as a ratio of DPH polarization in liposomes containing 37% cholesterol over the polarization in liposomes with no cholesterol. Membrane cholesterol content. Huh7.5 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 x 10 5 cells per well and treated with test compounds or vehicle for 24 h, or with \u03b2-cyclodextrin for 3 h, at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed three times with PBS before adding 2 ml of hexane:isopropanol (3:2) and incubating for 1 h on a rocker at RT. Supernatants were transferred to glass tubes and solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Total protein was extracted by addition of 1 mL protein solubilisation buffer (10 mM sodium borate, 1% SDS) after removal of the hexane:isopropanol supernatant. The dried lipids were dissolved in 1 ml cholesterol assay buffer (0.5 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sodium chloride, 25 mM cholic acid, 0.5% Triton X-100) by vortex. Total cholesterol was quantitated in 50 \u03bcl of the dissolved lipids using Amplex \u00ae Red Cholesterol Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and proteins were quantitated using DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Total cellular cholesterol is presented normalized to protein. In vivo infection assay: 4EFT Rosa26-LSL-Fluc mice (16) were assigned to three treatment groups. The first group received per timepoint 50 mg/kg bodyweight flunarizine per oral gavage and 50 mg/kg bodyweight intraperitoneally. The second group received per timepoint 50 mg/kg bodyweight flunarizine per oral gavage and 50 mg/kg bodyweight intraperitoneally. A third treatment group only received the vehicles alone. For the oral preparation flunarizine or pimozide respectively were solved in a formulation of HPMC K15 M (Sigma) in a 25mM citrate buffer (pH4.0). For intraperitoneal injections the drugs were dissolved in 0.2 M tartaric acid. The above described doses were administered 21 hours and 2 hours before and 2 hours after infection. Mice were intravenously infected with 2x10 7 TCDID 50 BiCreJc1. Generation of BiCreJc1 was described elsewhere (17). Rosa26-LSL-Fluc mice not expressing the 4 human entry factors served as negative control. At 48 hours post infection, mice were anaesthetized using isoflurane and injected intraperitoneally with 1.5 mg luciferin (Caliper Lifesciences). Bioluminescence was measured using an IVIS Lumina II platform (Caliper Lifesciences). Concentration of flunarizine and pimozide in murine blood serum was determined as follows. To a 50 \u00b5L aliquot of blood serum were added 80 \u00b5L of acetone. The suspension was stored at -80\u00b0C for 30 min before it was centrifuged. The supernatant was concentrated to dryness and re-dissolved in 30 \u00b5L of DMSO. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Ultimate 3000 RSLC system equipped with a BEH C18 (50\u00d72.1 mm, 1.7\u03bcm) column (Waters, Germany). Separation of a 5 \u03bcL sample was achieved by a linear gradient from (A) H 2 O + 0.1% HCO 2 H to (B) CH3CN + 0.1% HCO 2 H at a flow rate of 600 \u03bcL/min and 45\u00b0C.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "sizes (n<5), nonparametric tests could not be employed.

Supporting Fig. S6: Flunarizine inhibits a post-attachment, late entry step and deletion of the HVR1 facilitates neutralization of HCV infection in suspension. (A) Huh7-Lunet/hCD81/G-Luc cells were exposed to given compounds prior to, during, or after virus inoculation. Note that heparin prevents virus attachment (5,21), anti-CD81 receptor antibodies (JS81) inhibit a postbinding step of HCV entry (5), BJ486K (BJ) acts on virus particles and also interferes with a post-attachment step of cell entry (8), whereas concanamycin A (ConA) and bafilomycin (Baf) both inhibit acidification of endosomes thus preventing low pH-triggered viral membrane fusion (22), a very late step of productive cell entry. Incubation with drugs was terminated by washing cells twice with PBS. Infection was quantified 48 h post inoculation by using luciferase assays. (B) Parental Jc1 or Jc1 lacking the hypervariable region 1 (Jc1 DHVR1) was incubated with flunarizine, BJ486K or ConA at 37oC for 1h in suspension before 100-fold dilution and subsequent titration of virus infectivity by way of a limiting dilution assay. (C) Huh7-Lunet/hCD81/G-luc cells were incubated with F-Luc-Jc1 for 1 h at 4oC to allow virus attachment but no downstream entry steps. Subsequently, unbound viruses were washed and inoculated cells were incubated at 37oC. Flunarizine, heparin, CD81-specific antibodies (JS81), or ConA were added either during inoculation (protocol 1) or every 20 min until 3 h after transfer to 37oC (protocol 2-7). Each compound was incubated with the cells for a total of 4 h before washing and medium exchange. Cells were lysed and firefly luciferase measured 48 h after inoculation.

Supporting Figure S7: Flunarizine and related channel blockers have no effects on membrane fluidity. (A) Curcumin decreases membrane fluidity (23). DPH polarization increases in the presence of increasing concentrations of curcumin, both in 100% DOPC liposomes (open circles) or 37% cholesterol 63% DOPC liposomes (closed circles). (B) Flunarizine dihydrochloride (green), pimozide (orange), trifluoperazine dihydrochloride (dark blue) and fluphenazine hydrochloride (red) do not perturb membrane fluidity of 100% DOPC (open circles) or 37% cholesterol -63% DOPC liposomes (closed circles). Note that the y-axis scales differ in (A) and (B). (C) and (D) The effect of curcumin varies with cholesterol content. The ratio of DPH depolarization in 37% cholesterol -63% DOPC liposomes over that in100% DOPC liposomes decreases at higher curcumin concentrations. The lack of effect of the channel blockers is not affected by cholesterol content. Averages\u00b1 ranges (too small to be seen at this scale for several data points) from two independent experiments. DPH emits fluorescent light of the same polarization as the excitation light in a rigid environment, whereas the emitted fluorescence becomes less polarized if DPH is in a fluid environment, in which it moves from the time of excitation to the time of emission. The lipophilic DPH inserts into lipid membranes. The degree of DPH fluorescence polarization in this environment is inversely related to membrane fluidity. As expected, DPH polarization increased with increasing concentration of curcumin (Supporting Figure S7 A)(23). In contrast, none of the channel blockers had any major effects on DPH fluorescence polarization (Supporting Figure S7B). Moreover, the effects of curcumin on membranes varied with the different levels of cholesterol in the liposomes. Curcumin induced a larger rigidification of cholesterol-free than of liposomes containing 37% cholesterol (Supporting Figure S7C). None of the channel blockers was affected by the presence of 37% or no cholesterol in the liposomes (Supporting Figure S7D). Supporting Figure S8: Flunarizine and related channel blockers do not decrease cellular cholesterol. Huh7.5 cells were treated with test compounds for 24 h, or with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (BCD) for 3 h, before cellular lipids (and proteins) were extracted. Total cellular cholesterol levels are presented relative to protein. Trifluoperazine may increase cholesterol levels after 34 h, by less than 30%. Supporting Figure S9: E1 and E2 proteins resistance mutations to flunarizine confer crossresistance to pimozide.
