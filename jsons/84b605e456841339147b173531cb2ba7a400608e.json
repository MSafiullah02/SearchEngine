A multidisciplinary team approach (MDT) is required for decision making. This process is augmented by specific standard operating practices implemented by senior clinicians. Here, we report on our early experience and outcomes with open tracheostomies in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. We outline the criteria that guide decision making and explore the challenges faced by our intensive care colleagues in the management of these patients. The cohort was 100% male with 90% of them having a raised Body Mass Index (BMI) and other comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes). 50% have been decannulated and have been stepped down the intensive care unit. We recorded no surgical complications or adverse events. The service to date has been shown to be effective, safe, largely reproducible and reflective.",

Reduction in ICU length of stay, releasing essential capacity 2. Reduction in prolonged use of sedatives/analgesics 3. Earlier spontaneous breathing 4. Better bronchial toilet; less traumatic suctioning. 5. Faster delirium resolution. 6. Faster rehabilitation/physiotherapy. 7.
