Here, we describe our understanding of the 2019-nCoV epidemic and\nour experience with other coronavirus-related diseases in West China Hospital.

It will facilitate decision-making by health care workers with necessary clinical\ninformation, laboratory detection, and imaging findings. The approach consists of the\nfollowing four parts: screening, diagnosis, preventive control, and treatment of 2019-CoV\npneumonia (Fig. 1). Given our clinical experience in\npreventing and treating various viral pneumonia, including those caused by coronaviruses, we\nbelieve that such an approach would help in preventing further the spreading of\n2019-nCoV.",

As compared to the 2 months spent before the first report of SARS case in\nFoshan Guangdong Province in 2002,17,18\nthe 2019-nCoV infection was reported to the WHO China Office on 31 December 2019, less than\n1 month after the first few sporadic cases.19 Although many questions, such as detailed pathogenic\ncharacteristics, remain unanswered, from what we know about other coronavirus infections,\nthe behavior of 2019-nCoV is not unusual. To reduce the incidence of infection as well as\nprevent nosocomial infections, we have been working to establish a precision medicine\napproach for screening, diagnostic, in-hospital preventive control, and treatment for\nindividual patients. With this approach, West China Hospital identified 14 infected patients\nimmediately, each of whom was treated according to the approach developed by the\nmulti-disciplinary medical team. By the time this paper was published, one patient was\nclinically cured (negative nucleic acid test result for throat swab), while other patients'\nvital signs remained stable. Since then, the precautionary measures for prevention, control,\nand quarantine have been implemented and no cases of human-to-human transmission or\ninfection of the medical staff have happened in our hospital.",
