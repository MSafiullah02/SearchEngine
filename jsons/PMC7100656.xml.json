Both primary (familial) and secondary forms of the disease exist [2]. The familial form is autosomal recessive or X-linked in origin and generally occurs in infancy, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 50,000 live births [3]. Secondary HLH has been associated with infection (viral, particularly herpesviruses EBV and CMV; bacterial, fungal, tuberculosis), T-cell type maligancies and prolonged immunosuppression [3, 4, 5]. A classification of the histiocytosis syndromes is included in Table 1 [6].\n",

Five cases were familial in origin (one also with parainfluenza-3); a preceding immunologic abnormality or infectious etiology (four EBV, two adenovirus, one rotavirus and one Kawasaki disease) could be identified in eight secondary cases. Twenty-one patients received the HLH-94 protocol (or equivalent) chemotherapy; one required splenectomy for massive splenic enlargement.

A case of hepatosplenomegly, interstitial pulmonary infiltrates and skin lesions in an infant was described, in which reactive hemophagocytic syndrome developed and congenital tuberculosis was the inciting agent [15]. Gauvin et al [16] have described two cases of reactive hemophagocytic syndrome as a component of multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), characterized by acute respiratory-distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, liver dysfunction and septic shock, with pancytopenia and hemophagocytosis on bone-marrow aspirate. Several proinflammatory cytokines are common to both MODS and reactive hemophagocytosis. High levels of cytokines have been identified in serum and pleural fluid of patients with viral-associated hemophagocytic syndrome [17]. In our population, the usual progression of radiographic findings began with low lung volumes and central peribronchial interstitial thickening, followed by pulmonary edema and development of airspace disease and pleural effusions, similar to ARDS. An infectious cause was confirmed in a minority of our cases. Pulmonary hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, pulmonary edema, and bronchiolitis were frequent findings at autopsy.",

Previously described CT findings include hydrocephalus with perivascular lucencies and dilated subdural spaces. Hyperdense areas occur occasionally owing to calcification and necrosis. Atrophy occurred in four patients receiving chemotherapy for progression of disease [20]. Increased attenuation in a transverse sinus, possibly indicating thrombosis, was noted on CT examination in one 15-month-old boy [9]. Brain MR findings described include delayed myelination, parenchymal atrophy and diffuse abnormal signal in gray and white matter. Meningeal enhancement with contrast, followed by enhancing lesions of the gray and white matter, have been reported [24, 25]. MR spectroscopy findings of decreased N-acetyl aspartate and increased choline and lactate peaks are consistent with neuronal necrosis [10]. In the 18 patients imaged here, abnormalities of periventricular white matter, with or without brain volume loss, were a common finding. Meningeal enhancement with contrast was not observed; 1 patient had multiple enhancing parenchymal lesions.",
