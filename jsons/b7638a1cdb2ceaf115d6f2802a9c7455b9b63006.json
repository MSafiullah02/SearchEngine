            "text": "Most importantly, age is a very important confounding factor. The mean age of cancer patients (63.1 years) was significantly higher than that of those without cancer (48.7 years). Moreover, when focused on the 18 cases with cancer, the mean age with severe events was even higher than in those without severe events (71.89 years versus 54.33 years). There is clear evidence from other studies that older patients are more likely to be infected and have more serious conditions and death [2, 3] . More male patients (male 12 versus female 6) in cancer cohorts may also response for the high proportion of severe events in cancer patients, as female patients might have relatively mild symptoms. The logistic regression analysis further shows that age and gender have a significant impact on severity, thus it is necessary to carry out age stratification analysis or paired analysis according to age and gender. The results should be reported after adjusting for these two factors.",
