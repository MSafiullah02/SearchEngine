These four terms represent the key issues related to COVID-19 in Korea. The tweets were taken from a data set limited to a maximum of around 18,000 tweets.

The study traced the characteristics of information diffusion regarding COVID-19 on Twitter by generating communication networks composed of all tweets containing any of the search terms (\u201cCoronavirus,\u201d \u201ccorona19,\u201d \u201cShincheonji,\u201d or \u201cDaegu\u201d). A communication network in this study refers to a social network generated by users to communicate to each other. Each node represents a user, and the links between the users refer to a conversation (ie, a retweet, reply to, or mention). Four networks were generated. A network analysis was conducted to identify the multidimensional communication activities between Twitter users and grasp the nature of the information transmission networks composed of entities such as words, hyperlinks, and hashtags. Twitter users are compiled by subgroup using the Clauset\u2013Newman\u2013Moore cluster algorithm and visualized using the Harel\u2013Koren Fast Multiscale layout algorithm [32]. This method has been widely used in communication research on information measurement [33,34]. The study uses NodeXL to calculate various measures quantifying the efficiency of information diffusion and visualizing the structural topography of the network associated with the results of the four search queries as seeds. The network measures include modularity, the number of self-loops, and connected components. Modularity is an indicator of the community structure [35]. The higher the modularity value, the greater the subgroup interconnection. Components in a network analysis refers to a subgraph that represents nodes connected by paths [36]. A self-loop occurs when virtually no one replies to or mentions a tweet.",

The greater Daegu metropolitan area had Korea\u2019s highest COVID-19 infection rate per household as well as the highest absolute rate [45]. This study has found that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks because Twitter users in cluster A created within that network tended to be interconnected with others in cluster B. These findings have implications for risk communication and health campaigns. When government authorities and experts share and comment on real time information about ongoing infectious disease threats, social media analytics can help them to choose what keywords and hashtags are more appropriate to use. In fact, central and regional governments in Korea have been criticized for causing social confusion by failing to effectively communicate proper information on how to deal with the symptoms of infectious diseases. Our findings can be used to enhance government fact-checking services and risk communication. For example, the frequently shared topics and information sources regarding the Shincheonji-related Twitter networks could help both local and central governments to review people\u2019s concerns and opinions regarding the case and to guide information strategies in epidemic situations, which often demand prompt decision making for risk management.",

These limitations are inherent in Twitter\u2019s user population. The literature suggests that only 15% of online adults are regular Twitter users [47]. Moreover, the largest group among Twitter users is composed of those 18-29 years of age. In addition, only a small number of Twitter users are active in producing tweets and leveraging the discourse [47-49]. There are more very passive (<50 tweets per year) and very active users (>1000 tweets per year) on Twitter than moderate users (50-1000 tweets a year) [46]. Thus, the study\u2019s results may reflect social media users\u2019 views and behaviors during the pandemic rather than the full population\u2019s aggregate opinion. In addition, biases in information-sharing behaviors can exist, as some users may have produced more content than others. It was also possible that whether they are residents or visitors of Daegu City may have influenced what news they shared [50]. Furthermore, we qualitatively examined the study\u2019s data sets to detect abnormal activities such as data contamination from social bots; however, running Twitter bot detection software would have enabled us to more systematically remove any potential biases from the data set. Finally, we applied multi-coder methods, but two coders may not be sufficient to ensure reliability. Future studies could apply more coders to guarantee the reliability of the analysis results.",
