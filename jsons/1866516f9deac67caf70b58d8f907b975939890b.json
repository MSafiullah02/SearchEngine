Recently she has explored the epistemological consequences of the recognition of the social character of scientific inquiry in connection to pluralism, or the acknowledgement of explanatory plurality (Longino, 2002) . For Longino (2008) knowledge itself is social, because what matters is what the scientific community comes to agree or disagree on \u2026. Viewing scientific knowledge as socially constructed has influenced both the design of science classrooms as communities of learners, and the ways of studying classroom interactions, in particular the discursive ones, as argumentation (p. 469, italics added).

No one, for instance, thinks that it is a matter of choice about whether Michael Ruse or Peter Takacs should be included in the group Homo sapiens, and that Toto the dog and Secretariat the horse should be excluded.

For example, the Galilean transformation equations of classical kinematics proved not to be immutable, as they are replaced in special relativity by different and more general equations. Similarly, the approximations in Galilean equations are not less objective than the previously nonapproximate ones. The other characteristic that sometimes is invoked to understand objectivity is certainty. For example, the statement that \"Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643\" is considered to be certain and an instance of objective knowledge. However, even such statements are problematic as the information included may be erroneous or false. In this context, for Suchting (1992), understanding of immutability and certainty show the problematic nature of objectivity. Classified as Level III.",

Bacon's notion of objectivity required the scientist to be neutral and detached from the research project; (b) Contrary to Bacon's rules, history of science shows that values play an important role in the development of science as facts/data in and by themselves do not determine how they are to be interpreted; (c) Values tend to be contentious and thus can be regarded as a threat to scientific objectivity; (d) As Baconian objectivity is hard to follow, pluralism based on value-judgments is a virtue rather than a liability; (e) The social notion of objectivity was introduced by Popper (1962) and Lakatos (1970) and focuses on conflicting approaches adopted by scientists; (f) Longino (1990) has recommended science as social knowledge as the pluralist approach to objectivity helps to correct flaws and thus enhance the reliability of scientific results. Longino is widely considered to have undermined or dissolved the distinction between the epistemic and the social; (g) Pluralism remains as a step in the development of science and eventually gives way to consensus. This is supported by Kuhn's normal science and also based on the work of Kitcher (1993) , Laudan (1984) and Collins and Evans (2002) . Finally, Carrier (2013) concluded that pluralism does not detract from scientific objectivity but is a means to achieving objectivity: \"Scientific consensus formation is possible because, regardless of divergent epistemic inclinations and predilections, scientists have a fundamental commitment in common, the commitment, namely, to give heed to certain rules in debating knowledge claims. Adopting such rules serves to curb subjective preferences for the sake of producing knowledge that enjoys intersubjective assent\" (p. 2565). Classified as Level V.

Second, based on Keller (1992) she asserts that scientists are probably less reflective of \"tacit assumptions\" that guide their reasoning than any other intellectual of the modern age. Indeed, this is all the more ironic as Polanyi's (1966) tacit dimension was published almost half a century ago. Polanyi (1964 Polanyi ( , 1966 differentiated between two kinds of knowledge: (a) explicit, articulated, and formal knowledge; and (b) tacit, unarticulated, and non-formalized knowledge.

Rest of the citation constitutes a preamble and even perhaps a guide to future research on the application of history and philosophy of science (HPS) to science education. It refers to the difficulties involved in recounting any historical episode, and hence the problematic nature of objectivity. Interestingly, he draws a parallel between the scientist's theory and a historian's theory, as both are theory-laden. It is not farfetched to suggest that in the case of a conflict between the two theories, it is the historian's responsibility to set the record straight. A good example of this conflict is the role played by Holton (1978a, b) in the oil drop experiment that helped to understand Millikan's handling of his published data. Matthews (1992) provides another facet of this conflict by referring to the case of Galileo, who was considered by nineteenth-century philosophers and scientists as an inductivist and empiricist. However, this picture changed in the twentieth century and Galileo came to be considered as a Platonist dedicated to rationalism and thought experiments.",

However, the authors go on to clarify that based on the work of Mao (1986) , the concept of \"practice\" has been emphasized and consequently highly valued in China. Mao even considers practice as the sole criterion for testing truth and value of scientific knowledge (p. 847). Furthermore, besides the work of knowledgeable scientists, the term \"practice\" includes the work of ordinary people (e.g., workers and peasants). This provides the background for understanding objectivity as a consequence of everyday practice in different endeavors. According to Wan, Wong, and Zhan (2013): Since Marxists insist on the necessity to understand phenomena from their surrounding conditions, they also believe that science should be understood in its broad social context. It is stated that \"where would natural science be without industry and commerce?\" (Marx & Engels, 1970) \u2026. However, it should be noted that the emphasis on the influence of the social context on scientific activities does not lead Marxism in the anti-rationalism that characterizes various branches in the contemporary philosophy of science. Instead, the social influence on science is just considered as the opposite of and in a unity with rationality or objectivity of science. (p. 1122). Classified as Level III.",

For Ernest (1991) , this is not objectivity in the sense of logical necessity from which the objectivity can be recognised; rather, subjectivity becomes objectivity through consensus. The rationale for this is the failure of the foundationalist programme to establish certainty in the foundations of mathematics: take away the certainty of mathematics then you can take away logical necessity as having any role in establishing what is to be acceptedobjectivity merely becomes part of that which is accepted \u2026. What \"absolutist\" philosophies (Ernest's term for the foundationalist programme) have failed to establish is not logical necessity but absolute certainty in the foundations, but take away logical necessity (because it cannot be \"established\") and you have objectivity as synonymous with consensus in the sense that they are not separate entities from which the former may play a part in establishing the latter.

However, in their opinion it is not enough to say that objectivity can be equated with acceptance. Furthermore, in order to support their thesis of how objectivity cannot be equated with acceptance, Rowlands et al. (2011) provide the example of the 4-color theorem. This theorem was proven first by Alfred Kempe in 1879 and later by Peter Tait in 1880. However, 10 years later in 1890 it was found that both \"proofs\" contained fallacies. This episode led Rowlands et al. (2011) to conclude that consensus for proof (1880-1890) did not mean that the theorem was proved and hence objective. Despite the merit of this interpretation one could argue that it was the community that revealed the fallacies in the theorem and hence shows mathematics to be socially accepted knowledge, as suggested by Ernest (1991) .

It is not called history, of course. It is called \"science,\" but it is no less the historical canon for all that. Thus, the budding chemist learns Prout's and Avogadro's hypotheses, and Dalton's work on proportional combinations; he learns how to do Millikan's oil drop experiment; he works through Linus Pauling's struggles with the chemical bond. (p. 153) It seems that Laudan was writing the science/chemistry curriculum. Furthermore, history of science is replete with controversies among scientists (cf. Machamer, Pera, & Baltas, 2000) . This obviously leads to a dilemma: which history shall we include in the classroom? One laden with experimental details or the one based on theory-laden nature of observations leading to controversies in the history of science. History of science bears witness to the difficulties involved in interpreting experimental data and that the essence of the scientific endeavor is perhaps characterized by the creativity and imagination of the scientists. Under this perspective, telling students that scientists are \"objective\" and \"rational\" would be too simplistic. It would be more motivating to reconstruct the different historical episodes in order to illustrate \"science in the making\" and how science is practiced by scientists (Levere, 2006; Niaz, 2012) .",

            "text": "Later in the same article, Irzik and Nola (2011) state that scientific knowledge, though theory-laden, is nevertheless reliable because it is obtained by subjecting our theories to critical scrutiny, and Similarly, the fact that science is objective (in the sense that scientific findings are correct independently of individual, social and cultural variations) is a result of the same intersubjective critical process. That scientific experiments are reproducible also contribute to the objectivity of scientific knowledge. Whoever does the same experiment under the same conditions should come up with the same result regardless of when and where the experiment is carried out. Again, it is not clear in the consensus view how reliability and objectivity of science is to be explained without such considerations. (Irzik & Nola, 2011, p. 602) Nevertheless, this overlooks the fact that some long-standing controversies in the history of science were difficult to resolve and continue to provide considerable difficulties to students' experiences in the lab. An interesting example is the oil drop experiment (Klassen, 2009 ) which provides, even at present, very contradictory results in almost all parts of the world even with modern apparatus. Daston and Galison (2007) refer to the resolution of the controversy with respect to the oil drop experiment not due to the reproducibility of experimental data, but as an example of \"trained judgement.\" Also with this background consider Martin Perl's philosophy of speculative experiments. Finally, it seems that Irzik and Nola (2011) follow quite closely Kuhn's (1970) advice to science educators, that is just teach \"normal science\" (for a critical appraisal of Kuhn's \"normal science\" see, Niaz, 2011, Chap. 2, pp. 17-33) . Wong et al. (2009) turned crisis into opportunity by using the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) to understand and teach the theory-laden observations as part of nature of science in the classroom. They used an historical account of the \"hunt\" for the causative agent of SARS that was infused with several examples of theory-laden nature of observations. In one of the video clips they showed that immediately following the announcement on March 18, 2002, by a group of scientists from Hong Kong and Germany that the virus causing SARS was paramyxovirus, other research groups around the world quickly announced that they had also found evidence that paramyxovirus was the causative agent of SARS. Interestingly, However, only a few days later, on 22 March 2003, another group of researchers in Hong Kong announced that further evidence showed that coronavirus, rather than paramyxovirus, is the causative agent of SARS. Immediately after this announcement, several laboratories, including Rotterdam, Frankfurt and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, also confirmed the coronavirus theory. This episode illustrates the theory-laden nature of observation and shows how scientists' expectations or predictions influence what they see and how they interpret the data. Acknowledgement of the biased observation of data is in stark contrast to the usual school science curriculum portrayal of scientists as objective and impartial in interpreting data (Wong et al., 2009, p. 110 , as part of a section entitled: \"Objectivity of scientists and theory-laden observation\"). Classified as Level IV. This episode clearly shows the importance of \"science in the making\" and how it can facilitate students' understanding of theory-laden nature of observations and that objectivity is an ideal that comes with lot of effort and perhaps only in degrees (cf. Machamer & Wolters, 2004) . Furthermore, Wong et al. (2009) consider the initial acceptance of the paramyxovirus as the causative agent of SARS and its replacement by the coronavirus as a consequence of new evidence, as an illustration of the tentativeness of science, which is related to an essential characteristic of good science, such as skepticism and open-mindedness.",

Based on these considerations, Silverman (1992) suggested: \"How these questions are answered depends on the philosophical attitudes of the experimenter. Millikan scrutinized his measurements to determine where a particular experimental run was 'good'-that is in keeping with his expectations [elementary electrical charge, electron]. Ehrenhaft accepted all measurements in the belief [fractional charges, sub-electrons] that that constituted objective observation. The general philosophical climate of the experimenters' milieu also played an important role\" (p. 169). Classified as Level IV.",

Nor do many post-Kuhnian social constructionists do anything [to] counter this impression. In fact, some of them actually play into it. Under such conditions, portraying evolutionary science in any way that seems not to fit the model of well-confirmed science whose rudiments people, including journalists, learned in school generates in most audiences not a more complex conception of scientific inquiry suited to an inherently complex subject, but a sense that Darwinism is not really a science at all, but instead a world view or secular religion (pp. 361-362).

The claim of certainty for scientific knowledge which science educators grounded in positivist philosophy was rendered untenable years ago and it turns out that social and cultural factors surrounding discovery may be at least as important as the justification of knowledge. (p. 287) Cobern' main concern is to show that discovery in science inevitably takes place in a social and cultural milieu and lacks the certainty school science tries to convey as a dogma (cf. as reproduced in Niaz, Klassen, McMillan, & Metz, 2010b) . Interestingly, a recent study has highlighted the importance of the status of certainty/uncertainty of physics knowledge as a means to facilitate conceptual understanding: \"The knowledge that has already been acquired allows the researchers to raise new questions because there is uncertainty; a given study aims to decrease this uncertainty and then new questions emerge, again pointing out new uncertainty. This dynamics of uncertainty based on knowledge is a way of developing knowledge. We also consider that, in the students' processes of construction of knowledge, uncertainty can drive the learning process of knowledge\" (Tiberghein, Cross, & Sensevy, 2014, p. 931) . This clearly shows that uncertainty with respect to scientific knowledge need not be a constraint in learning science but rather can even facilitate construction of new knowledge.

But actually the two vitamin C solutions provided are both unboiled! To make certain if the students had really been convinced by the \"theory\" given in the task sheet, they were asked to predict the results before conducting the experiment. About 83% of them made predictions in line with the \"theory\" given. (p. 2646, original italics) Results obtained showed that the two groups of students obtained data in line with the predictions from the given \"theories\" about vitamin C, which shows the role played by theory-laden observations. These results helped the students to understand the idea that observations cannot be entirely objective. Interestingly, some students thought that they were \"tricked\" by the instructor and one student expressed, \"How come you give us something wrong \u2026\" (p. 2650). Finally, most students became more receptive to the idea that observations are not truly objective. Designing such studies can be helpful in facilitating a better understanding of the scientific endeavor.",

On the one hand, these authors recognize the importance of theory-laden observations but still recognize its problematic nature: \"Popper \u2026 partially endorsed the notion of theory-free observation when a radical change of theory occurs because past experiences or theories cannot guide scientists to modify the anomalies; rather, objectivity, rationality and elimination of subjectivity lead to new theory. Einstein \u2026, Heisenberg \u2026, and Feynman \u2026, outstanding physicists argue that neither 100% theory-independent, nor 100% theory-dependent observation really exists\" (p. 1172). Later, in this context these authors illustrate their thesis by providing the example of observations provided by the 1919 eclipse experiments: \"Without observational and empirical evidence, a theory cannot stand. For instance, when Einstein suggested the special theory of relativity in 1915, he was not a famous physicist at all. After the observation of the 1919 solar eclipse by Eddington, Einstein's theory was accepted and then, Einstein became famous\" (p. 1172). The actual events related to the eclipse experiments were much more complex. Niaz (2009, Chap. 9, pp. 127-137) has argued that if Edington (considered to be a major expert on Einstein's theory of relativity) had not been aware of the theory, it would have been extremely difficult to interpret observations from the eclipse observations, as providing support for the theory.

He then goes on to illustrate scientific practice by exploring the intricate relationship between facts and values: \"If history shows anything, it is that in science the facts have rarely been loyal to the values which initially led to their identification. When Darwin developed his theory of evolution, he made liberal use of facts that had been gathered by his teleologically oriented predecessors, but he did not respect the valuations which those facts originally carried. In fact, Darwin's approach turned teleological biology on its head and initiated the destruction of the man-centered and goal-oriented biology then prevalent\" (pp. 53-54) . According to Cordero this shows the invariance of scientific facts to value change. This, however, may constitute a dilemma for a science educator who believes that science and the values on which it is based are generally objective. Cordero (1992) resolves the dilemma in the following terms:",
