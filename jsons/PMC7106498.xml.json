These early analyses showed that SARS coronavirus is not a recently evolved pathogen, and group 4 was proposed within which to classify the novel coronavirus.20, 21 Subsequent alignment of the SARS coronavirus replicase open reading frame (ORF) 1b (about 5500 bp) genome segment, using the genus Torovirus (order Nidovirales) to root the tree, suggested that SARS coronavirus represents an early split-off from the coronavirus group 2 lineage22 and should be thought of as a group 2 subgroup.

            "text": "However, as clearly shown by analyses of other coronaviruses,28, 29 single-stranded RNA viruses are prone to recombination within and between lineages. This greatly complicates phylogenetic analyses, as different regions of the genome will have different evolutionary histories. Marra and colleagues20 proposed that SARS coronavirus may have undergone intergroup recombination after noting that the SARS coronavirus S2m motif is found in the group 3 avian coronaviruses, as well as the more distantly related equine rhinovirus (Picornaviridae). Later studies focused on the SARS coronavirus spike (S), matrix (M), nucleocapsid (N), replicase polyprotein (PP1ab), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) proteins with Bayesian techniques. Here, phylogenetic incongruence was reported to occur across the SARS coronavirus genome, by showing that the M and N genes were most likely to have originated from an ancestral bird (group 3) coronavirus, whereas PP1ab showed homology with a mammalian-like (group 2) coronavirus.24 Sliding-window approaches suggested that the S and RDRP genes are candidate mosaic sequences and identified the possible site of the original interlineage recombination events.24, 30 It has been proposed that recombination in the crucial S protein may have generated a virus with modified host specificities, leading to the contemporary emergence in human populations.24 An event of similar nature may have led to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. However, the bootstrap methods used24, 30 support an independent, and genetically distant, SARS coronavirus clade for all genes. This suggests that any recombination events, if they have occurred, are evidently ancient and therefore not implicated in the current emergence of SARS coronavirus in human populations.",

Coronaviruses were successfully isolated from the palm civet cats and raccoon dog, yielding two full-length genomes with 99\u00b78% homology to human SARS coronavirus.9 Further surveys of civet cats farmed in Hubei Province have shown that these too are infected with a SARS-like coronavirus.31 Comparative analyses of the Shenzhen civet cat sequences against those from 11 human isolates showed that the human and animal isolates are phylogenetically distinct.33 The genetic distance between civet cat coronavirus isolates is greater than that observed between geographically (China, Hong Kong, Canada) and temporally separated (early and mid-epidemic) human SARS coronavirus isolates.9 These data suggest that SARS originated from an animal reservoir, and that the ultimate source of the coronavirus that caused the emergence of the human SARS coronavirus genotype remains unclear. However, sequence data from a recent case (GD03T0013, isolated Dec 16, 2003) has found closer grouping with the civet cat coronaviruses than was previously observed,31 suggesting that civet cats may indeed be the source of SARS coronavirus. Further attempts to isolate the virus from market animals has met with little success.34, 35, 36 Final confirmation of the animal reservoir of SARS coronavirus therefore awaits a systematic survey of Chinese fauna.",

Molecular analyses have shown that the early phase of the epidemic was characterised by two genotypes. The first (cluster A) is composed of 10 isolates corresponding to the very early cases from Guangdong Province and three separate introductions to Hong Kong.33 The second (cluster B) corresponds to the so-called super-spreading event (SSE) triggered by the arrival of patient 1 (HKU-33) in Hong Kong;31, 33 this is the genotype that ultimately became pan-global. The finding that most of the SARS coronavirus genetic diversity occurs within cluster A is consistent with the epidemiological observations that Guangdong Province, China, is the geographical point of origin for the emergence of the virus.",

Using the divergence of S-gene sequences from 139 patients,33 linear regression dated the emergence of SARS coronavirus to mid-December, 2002 (95% CI late September, 2002, to mid-January, 2003).39 A recent study by the Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium31 attempted to correct for the potential effects of selection by only using synonymous (Ks) substitutions. They dated the ancestral sequence with the deeply rooted isolate GZ02 as an outgroup, and estimated an origin of mid-November, 2002 (95% CI early June, 2002, to late December, 2002). If correct, these data suggest that the earliest known SARS case, in November, 2002, was not far removed from the theoretical origin of the epidemic.",

If done, such an analysis would suggest that SARS coronavirus has been circulating, undetected, in China for longer than was previously expected. It is also evident from comparisons of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (Ka/Ks) in the S protein that the SARS genome is under strong directional selection.31 The use of techniques that account for variation in the rates of evolution over the course of the epidemic (ie, Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees, BEAST v1.0.2, available from http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/ [accessed Oct 4, 2004]) would therefore be appropriate.",

Furthermore, the average incubation period influences the timescale of the development of the epidemic, as it partly determines the time interval between a case and the infections that the case subsequently generates.

For example, in a large retrospective examination of case notes of quarantined close contacts of SARS cases in Beijing, China, the overall attack rate was 6\u00b73%, with the highest rates (15\u00b74%) in spouses and lowest rates in work and school contacts (0\u00b736%).73 These figures are further supported by large-scale screening for SARS coronavirus antibodies in direct contacts of SARS cases, which have very low rates (0\u00b72% were positive for SARS coronavirus IgG antibodies74). Nosocomial transmission therefore seems to have been the major source of new infections, with higher attack rates reported in this setting. For example, in a study of nosocomial outbreak in Toronto, rates in nurses working in the emergency department, ICU, and coronary care unit ranged from 10% to 60%.52 Good barrier protection was essential to prevent transmission: in a case-control study in Hong Kong, inconsistent use of goggles, gowns, gloves, and caps was significantly associated with a higher risk of SARS.75\n",

Estimation of the case fatality rate (CFR; the percentage of people diagnosed as having a specific disease who die as a result of that disease) during an outbreak is complicated because the eventual outcomes of patients still in hospital are unknown at the time of analysis. The duration of hospital stay depended on the severity of illness, but for most patients this was in the region of 14 days to 1 month.47, 76 Naive estimates of the CFR, based simply on the cumulative number of deaths divided by the cumulative number of cases,77 were therefore particularly misleading because they yielded underestimates of the true mortality. This bias was reduced as the epidemic progressed (and as the outcome of a greater percentage of patients was known), which is why reported estimates of CFR seemed to indicate that mortality was increasing over time, causing some to incorrectly conclude that SARS coronavirus was evolving to be more lethal.78, 79 The earliest estimates that used appropriate statistical methodology were published in May, 2003, with data from Hong Kong47 and worldwide,48 and gave final CFR estimates of between 14% and 18%. Table 2\nshows the estimates obtained in various cohorts, with CFRs at 21 days after hospital admission of 6\u00b75% and 10%, at 28 days of 10%, and at 3 months of 12%.46, 65, 66, 67 CFRs for those admitted to ICUs were significantly higher, with estimates at 28 days of 26% and 34% in Hong Kong and Toronto cohorts, respectively.80, 82\n",

Mathematical epidemic models14 describe (with varying levels of realism) the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of disease progression in the infected individual and transmission in the population.

If R0 is greater than 1, then an infectious disease outbreak has the potential to establish itself, resulting in an epidemic that will infect a substantial proportion of the population if there is no significant change in either the behaviour (ie, reduced mixing) or the susceptibility of the population (ie, through vaccination).

However, the relative ease with which an epidemic can be controlled is critically dependent on the magnitude of R\n0.14 To control an epidemic with R0=10 through vaccination, 90% of the population need to be immunised, whereas if R0=2, the level of coverage required drops to 50%.",

Wallinga and Teunis99 used an elegant method based on individual cases to infer the most likely network of contacts between cases from partial exposure data and estimates of the generation time distribution. This method allows direct non-parametric estimation of the mean and distribution of Rt through time. They calculated Rt to be 3 before the WHO global alert on March 12, 2003, and 0\u00b77 afterwards. Lipsitch and colleagues93 give a much broader range of 1\u00b71\u20137\u00b77 for R0. These estimates were derived using two methods, one fitting exponential growth to three pre-selected timepoints for data from Hong Kong, Canada, and Singapore, and a second, more sophisticated approach, resembling that used by Wallinga and Teunis.99 Overall, SARS can be classified as moderately transmissible, with smallpox being slightly more transmissible (R0=4\u201310)100 and measles being much more transmissible (R0=7\u201345).101\n",

The examples of patient 1 in Hong Kong, who infected 10 people in the Metropole Hotel (known as Hotel M) and additional people after his admission to St Paul's Hospital, Hong Kong,106 and the Amoy Gardens107, 108 cluster in Hong Kong are the best known, but patients who generated large numbers (>10) of secondary cases were also identified in Singapore (with at least five such patients49) and Canada.52 However, super-spreading individuals are not unique to SARS. Their existence has been well documented for tuberculosis,109 measles,110, 111 and smallpox,112 and they are believed to have occurred in other diseases including Ebola113 and the zoonotic transmission of monkeypox.114 Furthermore, the importance of a small number of individuals with high rates of partner change is critical to the epidemiology of many sexually transmitted infections.115, 116\n",

This is because in the earliest stages of a local outbreak the occurrence of an SSE dramatically lowers the chances of that outbreak becoming extinct by chance.93 Hence, SSEs are more likely to have occurred early in the outbreaks in those locations where large outbreaks were seen (eg, Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore). Ideally, one would like to characterise the overall distribution of secondary case numbers for SARS before and after controls were introduced. To do this rigorously would require a global analysis, given the early importance of international spread. However, the detailed contact tracing data required for such an analysis does not exist in some areas, and are incomplete for others where large outbreaks were seen.",

Variation in contact rates with other individuals in the population is also likely to have been important, and may indeed have been the dominant factor explaining SSEs. Such variation might be in the frequency of direct contacts (eg, large numbers of medical personnel saw the index patient in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong120) or indirect contacts (eg, unusual modes of viral spread in the Metropole Hotel and Amoy Gardens107, 108). Characterisation of heterogeneity in contact rates has been the topic of much research in infectious disease epidemiology,14, 121, 122 and various modelling approaches (including stratified population models123, 124, 125, 126 and individual-based network models127) have been developed to incorporate such heterogeneity. Masuda and colleagues105 use a network-based approach to model SARS, and concluded that SSEs are best explained by an increase in infectiousness in a few individuals, rather than extreme contact-rate heterogeneity. However, these conclusions are dependent on the investigators' simplifying assumptions about network structure. Overall, identifying the biological, social, or environmental causes for SSEs is important for the development of strategies for efficiently preventing or controlling such events, since the optimal choice of tactics to be employed will depend on the causative mechanisms.",

Answering these questions will depend mainly on the reliability and availability of the relevant data and will require multiple methodological approaches.",

Greater understanding of within-ward transmission would be gained into risk factors associated with both infectiousness and susceptibility from detailed stochastic modelling of patient and healthcare worker contacts. This work could usefully build on published Markov chain Monte Carlo models of nosocomial transmission.128\n",
