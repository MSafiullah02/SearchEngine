            "text": "Viral particles carry either a double-stranded DNA genome or a single- or double-stranded RNA genome. Viral genomes are replicated in the host cells through the expression of viral genes, a process that is a key factor in viral virulence. Host cells attempt to restrict viral amplification by activating innate immune signaling pathways such as RIG-I-mediated response [1] and/or RNA degradation enzymes such as XRN1 and RNase L [2]. To cope with host responses, certain viruses inhibit the innate immune system and RNA degradation through the suppressor activity of characteristic viral RNA sequences. For example, high-dimensional RNA sequences such as those containing stem-loops or the pseudoknots typical of the flavivirus [termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA)] interrupt the progress of XRN1 along the viral genomic RNA, thereby inhibiting RNA degradation and resulting in the accumulation of degradation intermediates [3,4]. These partially degraded viral genomic RNAs inhibit TRIM25, an ubiquitin ligase recognizing RIG-I, which then inhibits the host immune response. The Group C enterovirus contains phylogenetically conserved RNA structures that competitively inhibit RNase L, the antiviral endoribonuclease in host cells [5]. Thus, several viruses have evolved to carry RNA fragments with characteristic high-dimensional structures within their genomic RNA or in RNAs transcribed from their genomic DNA to regulate the fate of viral replication in host cells through the regulation of RNA degradation. However, a systematic study of the sequences regulating viral RNA stability has not yet been performed.",

Furthermore, the sequences of the identified viral sequences derived from the SARS-CoV genome were highly conserved within the Coronaviridae family, and some of the conserved sequences have a potential to form notable secondary structures. Additionally, the secondary structures are conserved in the novel coronavirus related to the ongoing coronavirus-associated disease outbreak that first emerged in December 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, the viral sequences identified by Fate-seq may enhance the genomic stability of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 within their hosts, where they have potential to inhibit the host's cellular RNA degradation machinery and to contribute toward viral replication efficiency and virulence.",

We also added an anti-reverse cap analog (ARCA) into the substrate mix to act as a modified nucleoside for incorporation as the 5\u2032 cap of the IVT mRNA, to avoid inhibition of translation [8]. Since recognition of the phosphate group at the 5\u2032 end of mRNAs by RIG-I triggers the immune system [9], we dephosphorylated the 5\u2032 ends of the IVT mRNA.",

More than 95% of the reads could be aligned, of which approximately 55% and 45% mapped to the forward and reverse strand, respectively. We then quantified the number of reads that aligned on the region of the viral sequences. Note that, since the total abundance of the introduced mRNA library decreased in a time-dependent manner, the counts in each sample were not absolute but were rather indicative of relative abundance among the mRNAs introduced into the cells. To identify viral sequences that confers RNA stability, we searched for the viral sequences with statistically significant increase in 6h compared to 0h samples. From the 11,848 viral sequences (corresponding to 5,924 fragments from forward and reverse strands), we filtered lowly-expressed sequences, resulting in the remaining 7,442 sequences. Among these, 625 viral sequences (377 from DNA viruses and 248 from RNA viruses) were significantly increased in 6h compared to 0h (adjusted p-value < 0.05) (Fig. 1E; Table S3; Table S4). These included viral sequences derived from various RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV. Since the 1,087 viral sequences derived from RNA viruses were derived directly from the parental viral genomes, these were considered more likely to function in a similar manner in vivo in host cells. Therefore, we focused on the viral sequences derived from RNA viruses, especially SARS-CoV, which is the RNA virus species with the highest number of increase viral sequences (Table S3), for further analysis. The SARS-CoV genome used to design the viral sequences consists of 29,751 bases, generating 296 viral sequences from the forward strand. Among these 296 viral sequences, 21 viral sequences significantly increased in the 6 h samples (Fig. 2\nA; Table S5). We termed these sequences \u201cRNA stabilizing regions\u201d.",

The obtained genome sequences were multiply aligned and the conservation rate of each base was calculated relative to the SARS-CoV genome. The data revealed that while the conservation rate was relatively low upstream and downstream along the genome, it was high near the central region (7,000\u201321,500 nt; Fig. 2B). Moreover, among the 21 viral sequences found to have significantly increased abundance 6 h after transfection, we found two with sequences exhibiting relatively high rates (>55%) of conservation (16,901\u201317,160 nt and 20,901\u201321,160 nt in the SARS-CoV genome; Table S5). In addition, to examine whether these regions play a role in the genomic stability of SARS-CoV-2, we compared the sequences of these regions between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

Since Stem #1 is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and is predicted to be a long and stable stem-loop, it may contribute toward the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. In silico mutations of COV001 in SARS-CoV of C to A at 17,114 nt and C to T at 17,144 nt formed a putative stem-loop similar in structure to that of Stem #1 (Fig. 3C). Note that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions corresponding to COV001 and COV002 were almost completely conserved among the 1,116 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences sampled from human hosts (Materials and Methods): 1,107 genomes (99.2%) for COV001 and 1,109 genomes (99.4%) for COV001 were identical (Fig. S1), indicating that their secondary structures are also highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2 strains. The co-occurrence of these mutations in SARS-CoV-2 may enhance the genomic stability of this virus within host cells through inhibition of the host's RNA degradation machinery, thereby contributing toward enhanced viral replication and virulence.",

Using 26 viral genomes as seeds, we evaluated the stability of individual regions of these viral genomes in parallel using genome-derived RNA fragments, and we detected stabilizing elements within multiple viral genomes including that of SARS-CoV. Moreover, comparative genomic analysis of the Coronaviridae indicated that two of these stabilizing regions (COV001 and COV002) were highly conserved in the Coronaviridae, suggesting that these sequences may play an important role in viral function in the host cell. Comparison of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that the sequences of COV001 and COV002 are highly conserved to the corresponding regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Inference of the secondary structure of these sequences indicated that the region in SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to COV001 forms a stem-loop that was not inferred for SARS-CoV. In contrast, both COV002 and the corresponding region in SARS-CoV-2 form multiple stem-loops. This potential difference in the secondary structure may contribute toward the virulence of SARS-CoV-2. The identified sequences, which might affect viral RNA stability and RNA-binding proteins binding to these sequences, may offer possible targets for the treatment of viral infectious diseases including COVID-19.",
