Tan referred to the history of the social work profession in the Western World as still focusing on microsystems, casework and the client as victim or person caught up in pathological relationships. Although many of the audience were radical social workers and community organizers, it is difficult to refute this imagery of the West when so much agency and therapeutic work is based on individual interventions financed through health insurance or in some countries, departments of child protection or education.",

Part of the challenge lies in funding sources for the profession. The exchange of information across countries can alert us to opportunities and strategies developed by other systems to separate the principles and implementation of social work practice from purely fiscal control. One example of fiscal control in the US is the influence of insurance company administrators on which claims for healthcare are appropriate. Fiscal responsibility is a professional expectation. When caught up in familiar systems, professionals may miss the wider array of practice that comes with a global view. Student exchange in particular, is a way to escape narrow vision. The focus of this article is the learning that can happen when students are encouraged into exchanges and conversations with social work students, educators and professionals in countries and cultures other than their own. In addition to conceptual arguments, reference is made to the increase in efforts to assess the impact of programs through research and evaluation (Van Hoof and Verbeeten, 2005; Center for Global Education, 2011).",

The premise of international exchange is to broaden thinking and recognize that limiting intervention to one model or another is to underserve communities. The tension becomes how to change traditions and find compatible language to share plans for effective future international and global collaboration in a fast globalizing world. Compounding this East\u2013West divide is the current demonizing, especially in the US but also in Europe, of China's fast industrial growth and dominant market position (Editor, Economist, December 2012). For example, it was part of the Republican platform in the US during their 2012 presidential election, to cast China in the negative light of cheap labor and exploitation. An alternative view sees a vast country with much work to do in terms of fair working conditions, catching up on the same cycles of industrial and postindustrial growth that countries of the West have passed through (Midgley, 2012). India and China, are two vast countries caught up in rates of growth that strain every aspect of life (Editor, Economist, December 2012).",

As a result of a formal exchange in China, student Cali Breese illustrates this goal:I was invited into Peace Corps service \u2026 I thought I was ready\u2026but each day I felt challenged to understand the dialects, the culture, strange sounds and smells, different social rules \u2026Cali Breese, excerpt from Link and Ramanathan, Rowman and Littlefield, 2011: p. 199\n",

Beyond the frank interpretation of meaning \u2013 what is trash to one, is rubbish to another is treasure to yet others \u2013 is the task to be truly curious, without feelings of superiority. It means realizing that our sense of reality is just one perspective on a complex gathering of cultures that make up the kaleidoscope of the world. Carter and Qureshi (1995) define culture in a way that reflects this notion of variety and equal worth: \u201cculture is a learned system of meaning and behaviors that is passed from one generation to the next\u201d in a geographical setting. Similarly Razack (2002: p. 251) puts culture at the center of student exchange, where colonial and oppressive history is looked in the eye and students challenge themselves to trace their generational identity.",

First, second or third world concepts are replaced with the (fourth) goal of recognizing that every country is part of a development cycle and all have elements of learning and human insight to share and to benefit from. A fifth goal, integration of this recognition of our universal generational experience of social and economic development, leads to more open attitudes to learning, to future career choices that include international opportunities and relationships (Bess and Link, 2012). Without this internalized recognition, social workers are at risk of ignoring valuable international policy instruments and worse, exposing themselves to unethical or illegal practice, such as the inadequate documentation of international adoptions (Rotabi, 2012; Shukovsky, 2003). These goals build the theory of student exchange, which is still relatively new, but the practice of exchange goes back much further (Lager and Mathiesen, 2012).",

Then, after the Great Depression and the eruption of the Second World War (in Europe 1939\u201345), there was rapid expansion in international organizations, pulling East and West into dialogue. Most central to the new forums for exchange during the 1930s was the League of Nations, and after 1948 the United Nations. Another step was the Commonwealth Youth Exchange Council, established in Nairobi and London in 1965. However, the domination of the norms of colonial power slowed true exchange. This is illustrated in the context of language that perpetuated attitudes of, First, Second, and Third worlds, first used in economic and development sociology (Midgley, 2012).",

The research reports that the children understood what was pressuring their parent into prostitution and wanted to stay with them. For a Western reader, ignorant of the cultural ties in Mumbai that take into account the community of prostitutes, the oppression of the control of prostitutes by male handlers, it is easy to be shocked at the idea of a child staying with her mother in such circumstances.

The examples cut across all forms of social work intervention. Some of the impact of exchange dialogue is highlighted in the example of the use of the UN Convention on the on the Rights of the Child. Another is the impact of the University of Mona, West Indies on practice with elders in Hartford, following the longstanding exchange with the University of Connecticut, School of Social Work Center for International Social Work. The social workers at the Seattle Adoption Agency may wish they had been more involved in formal social work exchange to avoid their malpractice (Shukovsky, 2003).",

If social work exchanges continue to build, the next generation will take the new \u2018Global Agenda\u2019 seriously. The Global Agenda combined the work of the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW), the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW), and the International Council on Social Welfare (ICSW) and was agreed at a conference in Hong Kong in March 2012 (IFSW, 2012). The agenda includes \u2018a set of objectives to meet our joint aspirations for social justice and social development\u2019 (IFSW, 2012). The Global Agenda expects students and educators, through their exchanges, to join in communicating and organizing in solidarity with social work practitioners across the world. To be effective as a profession in a globalizing world, we have to seize the moment and build international exchanges.",
