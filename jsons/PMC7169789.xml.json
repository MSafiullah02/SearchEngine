They also showed hyperphosphorylation of TRBP by JNK during M phase. Wilson et al. reported the 3D structure of a fragment of Dicer in complex with TRBP domain 3. A Dicer mutant deficient for TRBP and PACT binding was shown to alter strand selection and iso\u2010miR distribution for certain miRNAs. Please see Further Reading.",

(a) Precursor (pre\u2010)microRNAs (miRNAs) are RNA hairpins that are produced in the nucleus, and exported to the cytoplasm. They contain the \u223c22 nt sequence of the mature miRNA, indicated in red. The endonuclease Dicer removes the terminal loop to give an RNA duplex, one strand of which is loaded into an Argonaut (Ago) protein to form RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC). TRBP and PACT are implicated in both Dicing and RISC loading. (b) PACT and TRBP have roles in at least two viral response pathways. First, PACT can facilitate activation of retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I) by viral double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) (distinguished from cellular dsRNA by distinct molecular features, discussed in section TRBP and PACT mediate innate immune surveillance). This begins a signaling cascade that results in the production of interferon and other antiviral genes. PACT and TRBP also regulate PKR, a kinase that targets the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 to inhibit protein production and promote apoptosis. TRBP inhibits PKR, while PACT can activate it in response to cellular stress. (c) Both PACT and TRBP contain three double\u2010stranded RNA\u2010binding domains (dsRBDs). The first two domains can bind dsRNA, while the third cannot. Interactions with many other proteins have been documented, particularly for the third domain. Solid lines indicate direct protein\u2013protein interactions, while dashed lines indicate interactions that may be mediated via dsRNA. The third dsRBD potentially has an N\u2010terminal extension, based on sequence conservation. Each protein has a number of phosphorylation sites (marked by yellow triangles) that regulate function under certain conditions. A region of TRBP implicated in cancers exhibiting microsatellite instability is indicated in red.",

The top line shows the secondary structure of a \u2018typical\u2019 dsRBD, taken from the three\u2010dimensional (3D) structure of TRBP domain 2 (PDB accession: 3ADL). Residues conserved between all domains are highlighted in black; those conserved between domains 1 and 2 are highlighted in dark gray; while those conserved in the third domain are shown in light gray. The regions of domains 1 and 2 that bind RNA [located in helix \u03b11, the loop between \u03b2 strands 1 and 2 (loop\u2010\u03b212), and helix \u03b12] are boxed, as is a conserved region upstream of domain 3, which may represent a structural element additional to the standard dsRBD fold. On the right, the % identity (% similarity) shows that equivalent dsRBDs between TRBP and PACT are more similar than dsRBDs within the same protein. The sequences were aligned using Multalin,16 and rendered using ESPript17 (http://espript.ibcp.fr). (b) Two views of TRBP\u2010D2 bound to two molecules of 10 bp double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) (PDB accession 3ADL). The RNA\u2010interacting regions shown in part (a) are highlighted. Several parts of the dsRNA\u2010binding interface are flexible, most notably loop\u2010\u03b212 in the second RNA\u2010interacting region, which contains a highly conserved histidine residue. (c) Structure of a Staufen\u2010D5 dimer (PDB accession 4DKK). The N\u2010terminal extension (consisting of two \u03b1\u2010helixes) is thought to interact with the dsRBD core of a second molecule. The linker between the dsRBD core and the extended region is not visible in the crystal structure, and is indicated here with dashed lines.",

It is unknown whether all three components assemble prior to double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding, or if the complex is more dynamic. In vivo, it is likely that other proteins associate with the RISC\u2010loading complex.67, 68 (d) At least four possible roles for TRBP/PACT can be envisaged (see section How Do TRBP and PACT Affect Processing by Dicer and the Formation of Active RISC?): (1) TRBP/PACT may help recruit dsRNA to Dicer; (2) TRBP/PACT may aid alignment of dsRNA for cleavage by Dicer; (3) TRBP/PACT may help dsRNA unwinding and/or loading into Argonaute proteins; or (4) TRBP/PACT may favor processing and loading of different substrates into RISC (the substrates shown are illustrative only).",

            "text": "Figure 4: (a) In the absence of appropriate ligands, retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I) has an inactive conformation, in which the helicase domain binds to the caspase recruitment domains (CARDs). 5\u2032\u2010Triphosphate double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) binds to the C\u2010terminal domain (CTD) and helicase domain, which displaces the CARDs and results in signaling. It is less clear how Protein Activator of PKR (PACT) enables RIG\u2010I activation: one possibility is that it increases RIG\u2010I binding to additional ligands such as long dsRNA that lacks a 5\u2032\u2010triphosphate. (b) PKR can bind to long dsRNA through two N\u2010terminal double\u2010stranded RNA\u2010binding domains (dsRBDs). This brings PKR molecules together to form dimers, which can then autophosphorylate and become active. PACT (when phosphorylated during cellular stress) can also activate PKR, although the mechanism is unclear. The two main hypotheses are: PACT\u2010D3 contacts the kinase domain, somehow favoring activation, or PACT dimers can bind two molecules of PKR, promoting their dimerization and activation. TRBP acts as an inhibitor of PKR, either because its third domain cannot interact with PKR's kinase domain or because its third domain exhibits weaker dimerization.",
