However, new control strategies are still needed since FMDV outbreaks still occur in some diseasefree countries. Currently, interferon (IFN)-based strategies have been demonstrated to be an efficient biotherapeutic option against FMDV; however, interferon omega (IFN-\u03c9) has not yet been assessed in this capacity. Thus, this study evaluated the antiviral activity of porcine IFN omega 7 (PoIFN-\u03c97) against FMDV. After the PoIFN-\u03c97 was expressed and purified, cell proliferation assays and quantitative real-time reverse transciption-polymerase chain reaction were used to evaluate the effective anti-cytopathic concentration of PoIFN-\u03c97 and its effectiveness pre-and postinfection with FMDV in swine kidney cells (IBRS-2). Results showed the rHis-PoIFN-\u03c97 fusion protein was considerably expressed using Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain, and the recombinant protein exhibited significant in vitro protection against FMDV, including two strains belonging to type O and A FMDV, respectively. In addition, PoIFN-\u03c97 upregulated the transcription of Mx1, ISG15, OAS1, and PKR genes. These findings indicated that IFN-\u03c9 has the potential for serving as a useful therapeutic agent to prevent FMDV or other viral outbreaks in pigs.

            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious acute disease that affects cloven-hoofed domestic and wild animals, and the clinical symptoms include fever, lameness and vesicular lesions on the feet, tongue, snout, and teats. 1 Disease control includes sacrificing infected and susceptible animals, inhibiting animal movement, disinfecting contaminated premises, and vaccinating susceptible animals. 2 However, vaccination is not recommended in diseasefree-countries due to several reasons, including technical limitations in distinguishing vaccinated and infected animals, different antigenically variable strains of the virus, and trade restrictions. 3 As a result, OIE has recognized that to be effective; control measures should include vaccination in combination with the use of antiviral agents and/or immunomodulatory molecules that could rapidly control the disease before an adaptive immune response is induced. 4 Interferons (IFNs) are a group of cytokines that are divided into three types, including type I, type II and type III, and they constitute the first step in the immune response to pathogens. 5 Type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, \u03c9, \u03ba, \u03c4 are the largest group in the interferon family and have been well-characterized for their action against viral infections. 6 IFN-\u03c9 genes were initially found in humans thirty years ago, and since then, have been identified in other animals except canines and mice. 7 Similar to other IFNs, IFN-\u03c9 is produced by cells in response to viral infection and has identical antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities by binding to the same receptors and activating similar pathways to the interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor. 8, 9 The feline IFN-\u03c9 was the first licensed interferon compound, which is used in cats for the treatment of feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus infections (Virbagen\u00ae, Virbac) in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico. 10 Unfortunately, it has been not utilized for other viral infections. In fact, IFN-\u03c9 also exerts a protective effect against several viruses, including Interestingly, different subtypes of IFN-\u03c9 have distinct antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. For example, among the four IFN-\u03c9 pseudogenes and eight functional genes in the porcine IFN-\u03c9 (PoIFN-\u03c9) family, porcine IFN omega 7 (PoIFN-\u03c97) has the highest antiviral activities, which are approximately 20 times than PoIFN-\u03c94, which has the lowest antiviral activity. 11 Additionally, IFN-\u03c9 has lower in vitro cytotoxicity, compared to other interferons, making it a therapeutic candidate for treating some viral diseases. 11 In this study, PoIFN-\u03c97 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and its antiviral effects against FMDV was assessed in vitro.
