In line with another recently published study (23), our study indicated that an asymptomatic individual had similar viral load as a symptomatic case, both at low levels, suggesting a transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases. To confirm this finding, we used quantitative and normalization methods, to allow valid comparisons of the different specimens. As our tertiary case was exposed to two symptomatic and one asymptomatic case in apartment 1 of the chalet, it was not possible to disentangle who of those was the source of infection. However, given that the virus can remain viable and infectious on surfaces up to days, environmental contamination via the index case cannot be excluded (24). Future seroprevalence studies will be warranted to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic infections, and household and viral shedding studies to determine the transmission dynamics of asymptomatic individuals (25).",

This mild clinical picture contrasts with the first reports of Covid-19 cases series, which featured a high proportion of severe pneumonia and a considerable case-fatality (6) (7) . This indicates that the proportion of mild SARS-CoV-2 may be higher than initially suspected. In our cluster, cases could continue their activities, including skiing (and schooling for the child) while symptomatic, and interacted with many other individuals, increasing possibilities for transmission. Despite those interactions, only one tertiary case was detected and linked to the chalet. It is unlikely that we missed symptomatic cases, as we monitored and tested all contacts that developed symptoms during the 14-day follow up period. However, we may have missed asymptomatic cases. Despite extensive contact tracing, some contacts were either impossible to trace (e.g. people sharing ski cabins or lifts, co-travelers in public transportations who did not book their tickets online) or evaluated as negligible because of short and/or distant contacts (e.g. casual contacts). Accidental events at risk of transmission in such occasions, such as an episode of cough of sneezing, cannot be ruled out.",

Case 4, the asymptomatic case, had the same natural history of viral excretion as symptomatic case 3 with a viral shedding of 7 and 6 days respectively. Cases 2 and 6 (child) had similar shedding patterns, with virus load close to the limit of quantification for several days before being negative, much lower than those observed in cases 3 and 4. Case 13 had an endotracheal aspirate (ETA) positive at D4 with SARS-CoV-2 (viral load of 2.4 log10 copies/1000 cells), while negative in the nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) collected since admission (8 days). The NPS of the same day and the following days remained negative. The daily follow-up revealed a short-lasting excretion with only two successive ETA with a lower viral load (2.4 log10 and 1.1 log10 copies/ 1000 cells, respectively, Figure 4), the subsequent ETA remained negative. All cases were negative for other viruses except for the pediatric case, who had a SARS-CoV-2 + picornavirus (rhinovirus or enterovirus) + influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infection. His two siblings were negative for the SARS-CoV-2, but had an Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, and an Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 + picornavirus co-infection.",

            "text": "). Although estimates and confidence intervals around those estimates may differ, the observed R0 in this cluster was at least 3 times higher, suggesting a possible \"super spreading\" event. Several \"super spreading\" events occurred during other emergingcoronavirus outbreaks, such as the outbreaks of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2015, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 (13). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share the same cell receptor, human angiotensinecoverting enzyme 2 (hACE2) (14); as the expression of hACE2 is more important in the pneumocytes and lower airways epithelia, cases with pneumonia and/or bronchitis may both produce and (by cough or sneezing) disseminate more efficiently the virus (15). Given their high propensity to spread infection, super-spreaders probably shed larger amounts of pathogen and for a longer period of time (16). A complex combination of factors, including the host, the virus, the behavior of individuals and the environment (proximity and air flow dynamics), all likely play a role in the number of subsequent infections initiating from a single super-spreader",

            "text": "the infected child, despite interactions with a large number of contacts in different schools, did not transmit the disease, as evidenced by the large number of negative results of his tested contacts. However, the high proportion of picornavirus and influenza infections among his contacts at the schools indicated transmission of those viruses within those settings. Similarly, we observed that the family cluster allowed the dissemination of picornaviruses or influenza A viruses in the 3 children, while SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only one child. These two observations suggest that picornavirus and influenza infections are more easily transmitted than SARS-CoV-2. It is possible that viral interference in the host may impact the individual susceptibility to another viral respiratory infection as observed during the 2009 influenza pandemic and other winter seasons between A(H1N1) influenza virus and RSV (26-27). It is also possible that the very low viral load of the pediatric case and the subsequent lack of transmission might be related to his co-infection and the cocirculation of respiratory viruses. Viral load was only tested 8 days after his onset of symptoms. The child continued his normal activities and interactions as his symptoms were mild. Current evidence indicates that children develop Covid-19 less often than adults and the clinical manifestations of the disease are milder (28-30). The above suggest that children, being less likely to be infected and more likely to develop mild disease, may play a less important role in the transmission of this novel virus.The tertiary case has been regularly screened for SARS-CoV2 infection through the testing of nasopharyngeal specimens. Following the development of fever and dry cough and abnormalities in the CT scan, two endotracheal aspirates collected on two consecutive days were positive for the SARS-CoV-2. However, the nasopharyngeal swabs collected on the same days remained negative. Earlier reports noted a higher detection rate in lower respiratory tract specimens, than upper respiratory tract specimens (31). This dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results has been recently documented and may be related with compartmentalization of infection along time, and with the virus receptor",

            "text": "specimens only. This case suggests that some clinical presentations may be limited to lower respiratory tract infection, not necessarily severe. In our case, only two successive specimens were positive, with a low viral load. This suggests an unlikely risk of transmission, but a risk of missed diagnosis if lower respiratory tract specimens are not screened in suspected cases with signs of lower respiratory tract infection. This cluster occurred during the winter season. As the case definition was sensitive, the proportion of possible cases in contacts with respiratory signs/symptoms was high. Of those, 64% tested positive for other respiratory viruses circulating in the community during this winter period. Due to public anxiety, many parents asked for a screening test to exclude the possibility of Covid-19 among their children. However, following the surveillance protocol, health professionals mostly tested symptomatic individuals who met the case definition of a possible case. Rapid and accurate risk communication targeting the contacts of the cases and the general public of the skiing resort were crucial for the management of this outbreak. No further tertiary cases were detected within the 14-day follow-up period of the numerous contacts, indicating that this transmission chain was successfully interrupted. This investigation required collaboration with the health authorities of five different countries (France, UK, Spain, Switzerland and Australia) with the support of EWRS and International Health Regulations (IHR) national focal points, underlying the added value of international notification systems. The subsequent generation of cases was detected within 24 hours after the initial notification and an extensive contact tracing exercise was rolled out on the next day, requiring quick and coordinated mobilization of approximately one hundred professionals during the weekend and the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams at the local and national level.

The occurrence of a case in a child, coinfected with other respiratory viruses, who did not transmit the disease despite interactions with his classmates suggest that children might not be an important source of transmission of this novel virus. The potential dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscore the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution and screening of the suspected COVID-19 cases. Finally, preparation, international collaboration and early warning and response systems, and a multidisciplinary approach are essential elements for the effective management of and quick response to emerging infectious diseases.
