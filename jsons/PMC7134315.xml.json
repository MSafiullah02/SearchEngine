Some have been quite successful, while others have failed, and there have been various reasons for the success and the opposite (Islam and Gr\u00f6nlund 2016; Zheng et al. 2016). In one-to-one (1:1) programs, all students are equipped with portable devices, such as laptops, tablets, smartphones and the like for learning purposes (Balankasat et al. 2013). Previous studies on 1:1 implementation suggests various efforts in order to succeed. For example, to ensure that changes are \u2018systemic and underpinned by pedagogical values\u2019 (ibid, pp. 7). Moreover, over the years, teachers\u2019 beliefs and views regarding the use of technology in classrooms have been studied by quantitative approaches (Scherer et al. 2019; Tondeur et al. 2012; Tondeur et al. 2016) and by qualitative approaches (Prestidge 2012; Tondeur et al. 2012; Genlott et al. 2019). Moreover, studies on such initiatives have looked at learning outcomes, and changes in workstyles for students and teachers. Findings suggest that one-to-one initiatives enhance student-centered teaching and learning (Hershkovitz and Karni 2018; Lindqvist 2015).",

            "text": "Even if 1:1 initiative in schools are increasing, we still have limited knowledge of the impact of such a digital transformation of education. Research has been directed towards the infrastructure, such as types of hardware and software use, Wifi-coverage and the like, and the prevalence of the number of pupils who have received their own digital devices, in English has often been referred to as 1:1 computing. or 1:1 coverage. Research has also looked at what is called 1:1 learning, that is teachers\u2019 pedagogical approaches and students learning in contexts where each student has their own digital device (Bocconi et al. 2013). In 2013, Bocconi and colleagues examined 29 1:1 programs in 19 countries in Europe to elucidate how such initiatives contribute to different types of innovation in education. One finding was that most of these efforts were primarily aimed at infrastructure, that is to equip schools with 1:1 coverage and to some extent also to contribute with competence development for the school\u2019s teachers. In such studies, much of the attention was focused on getting students more motivated for learning and technically competent. We also find such studies in the Nordic countries (Gilje et al. 2016). Later studies have confirmed that 1:1 coverage enables adapted training (Chauhan 2017). At the same time, some student groups may be more easily distracted from doing other things than learning (Zheng et al. 2016). Furthermore, 1:1 coverage will enable what is often called student-active teaching and learning (Genlott and Gr\u00f6nlund 2016). This means that the student is placed at the center of his/ her own learning and traditional instructor-driven teaching is given less space. Here, researchers disagree about what student-active teaching and learning in practice entails and what role a teacher should have. Such discussions are often colored by researchers\u2019 different pedagogical positions. For example, researchers who are concerned with socio-cultural approaches to learning work are more likely concerned with how technology can contribute as an artefact in such interactions, while researchers with a behavioral approach will increasingly use technology as a resource for repetitions. (Zheng et al. 2016; T\u00f8mte et al. 2018). Moreover, class leadership in technology-intensive classrooms requires different types of competence and skills than in classrooms where technology has less space (Genlott and Gr\u00f6nlund 2016). Researchers suggest that a holistic approach to change common to all schools in a municipality is important; it enables a larger network, and a shared understanding of the objectives of the change. In addition, it is easier to follow up for school owners, operating costs are kept under control by connecting user support to only one operating system and type of device. At the same time, the schools are different in technology maturity and professional digital competence and the initiatives can thus be experienced as demanding for some, but feasible for others (ibid). Several studies reveal an increased need for knowledge about governance, leadership and educational development work in schools with 1:1 coverage (Islam and Gr\u00f6nlund 2016; Genlott et al. 2019).",

            "text": "The theory has also gained ground in educational research, and especially in studies of the introduction of new technology. For example, Sahin (2012) studied teacher students\u2019 perspectives on the use of ICT in primary school, while Li and Huang (2012) studied implementation of game-based learning in primary school in light of Rogers\u2019 theory, and Akin (2016) reveals how school administration interpreted and used the authorities\u2019 ICT-based plans and strategies. Genlott, Gr\u00f6nlund and Viborg, explored Rogers\u2019 theory to shed light on how to introduce a new ICT-supported educational model in primary school. Through a survey of teachers who have taken a one-year course in the educational method WTL (Write to Learn), they highlighted three general implications: First, the method worked best when teachers use it as a reference point more than a set of standards. This way teachers would enable to use the method in the light of tailored training and student creativity, and to safeguard and further develop their own competence development. Second, Genlott and colleagues recommend establishing an extended social system involving more than one school. Larger school networks add more energy and allow for further dissemination and sharing of ideas and practices. Third, it is important to keep in mind that not everyone can be an innovator and therefore it is important to have a network large enough to handle discussions and knowledge about the new method/ innovation. In order to ensure dissemination, it is crucial to involve those with previous experience in using the innovation, and those who are good communicators, that is, who are good at communicating the method and the usefulness of the innovation to colleagues. It is also important to allow time for change, while ensuring continuous growth in the network. Of course, the quality of the innovation is decisive, and preliminary studies on the quality of the innovation are often carried out before starting to spread/ roll out. This again means that the school management also needs to be well updated on recent research in order to see the results of the innovation.",

The municipality asked schools to provide feedback on the latter through a questionnaire.

In the interviews, teachers stressed that their workflow had been improved, in that all notes, files and submissions were stored within the Chromebooks, and not on diverse sheets of paper. However, as for pedagogical change, we observed only a slight development from teacher-directed teaching towards more student-active pedagogical approach, where Chromebook served as an integral part of the learning design. At the same time, we also observed that many teachers experienced challenges with class management in these new technology rich learning environments. One explanation was that such classrooms required a different pedagogical approach (Lindquist 2015). Teachers had to ensure that students used the Chromebooks for learning and not for non-schooling activities (Zheng et al. 2016). This required awareness of pedagogical use Chromebook, and a balance between digital and analogue teaching. While some teachers seemed eager in exploring new opportunities with the help of Chromebook, others were more hesitant about how Chromebook and digital resources could contribute in their teaching and learning. Some of these teachers called for more time to familiarize themselves with Chromebook and specific digital resources, others were less enthusiastic towards the change of their own teaching that came with the Chromebooks. One teacher put it this way: \u201cI would have started with Chromebooks and spreadsheets earlier, but I just noticed that I have postponed and postponed, because I always have something else that I can do.\u201d Nonetheless, some of the tech-savvy teachers were more enthusiastic towards the Chromebooks and stated that they often used their own free time, such as evenings, weekends and holidays to find new opportunities for teaching with the support of technology. One of them expressed his experience of the implementation as follows: \u201cI think I might be an enthusiast about technical stuff, so I just find it fun to try new things.\u201d Another observation was the differences in the scope and use of digital resources between subjects; for example, in classes where the subject Norwegian were taught, a multitude of digital resources were explored, whereas in Mathematics, we observed a more traditional analogue teacher-led instruction.",

The introduction of the technical-administrative part that works on the Chromebooks went smoothly, and there were few technical issues related to infrastructure. We demonstrated how the research literature points out that understandings of change can also be seen as two-step processes, in which so-called \u2018first order change\u2019 is often about doing the same, but with new technology, while \u2018second order change\u2019, on the other hand, means that the activities themselves are redefined. In our study, we have shown that the work of addressing what we have called \u2018second order change\u2019 is in the form of an emerging maturation process in which teachers see new opportunities after they have begun to explore and understand the educational possibilities. by digital learning resources. At the same time, there is still a way to go to unleash the potential that lies in overcoming the \u2018power of analogue practice\u2019, i.e. \u2018first order change\u2019. In the further development and implementation work in the schools in the municipality, this disparity between the teachers, the need for coordination and coordination across schools, as well as the extra work required to radically change teaching forms, should be considered. The work of addressing \u2018second order change\u2019 and new teaching methods will be even more demanding as \u2018first order change\u2019. In sum, this is likely to represent a need for higher priority and increased resources for the further educational development work in the municipality.",
