Approximately 11-15% of human proteins are secreted as soluble proteins to the extracellular space [[1], [2], [3]] and an additional 10% localise to the plasma membrane [4]. This represents over 3500 proteins with a vast array of functions, including antibodies, signalling molecules, and integral endomembrane proteins which traffic to the plasma membrane before being internalised to the endolysosomal system. Secreted proteins are not only numerous, but abundant, with the secreted protein collagen family accounting for 30% of total protein mass in mammals [5]. This review will focus on the trafficking route and machinery required to deliver proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "To identify the fundamental machinery of the secretory process, the laboratory of Randy Schekman performed a genetic screen in yeast [23]. Secretory mutants in yeast accumulate proteins and membrane intracellularly, making the cells denser. These mutant yeast would therefore differentially sediment from wild-type yeast on density gradients. This principle was employed to screen the yeast genome for mutants of the secretory system. To perform this screen they used \u2018temperature sensitive\u2019 (ts) mutants. ts mutants result in temperature dependent protein instability. Proteins with ts mutations fold properly in a \u2018permissive\u2019 temperature, but when the temperature is shifted they misfold, thus revealing the phenotype of protein loss. This allowed a set of 23 complementation groups (Sec1-23) to be discovered in what was called the Sec screen [23]. One of the major findings from this screen was the COPII protein complex that allows for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport. Along with Rothman\u2019s work [24,25], this landmark study identified the first genes encoding the machinery involved in protein trafficking and secretion. At this point, however, the route from the early secretory system to the plasma membrane and the machinery involved was still not understood.",

The \u2018bulk flow\u2019 model states that secretion from the ER through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane does not require a signal and happens in \u2018bulk\u2019 by default. The first hints at this hypothesis came from the secretion of bacterial \u03b2-lactamase after microinjection of the RNA into Xenopus oocytes [27]. Subsequently, bulk peptide secretion was demonstrated by monitoring glycosylation and secretion of exogenously added peptides to mammalian cell lines and detecting their arrival at the cell surface [26]. A subset of the secreted peptides were glycosylated indicating they had been transported through the Golgi apparatus. The conclusion was that these peptides were secreted in bulk by default.",

Most of these studies focussed on the ER export of membrane spanning proteins rather than the Golgi to plasma membrane route. Studies on soluble proteins reported increased concentration of secreted proteins as they are trafficked to the plasma membrane, suggesting that they are actively sorted. Concentrative transport of soluble proteins, however, was thought to be due to selective removal of other cargo rather than active sorting, supporting the idea that there is no selective transport on the soluble cargo itself [28,29]. There are a subset of soluble proteins that are actively sorted from the ER, such as GPI anchored proteins which are sorted by the p24 protein family [30] and proteins including cathepsin C [31], cathepsin Z [32], factor V, and factor VIII [33] which require the ERGIC-53/LMAN1 receptor.

In yeast, induction of secretion of acid phosphatase with a temperature shift indicates a six-fold increase in secreted protein with almost no detectable increase in intracellular levels [34]. Studies in plants demonstrated that 50-90% of synthesised soluble proteins are delivered to the extracellular space [35,36], consistent with studies in mammalian cells [37]. A quantitative study on the secretion of a soluble non-glycosylated protein found that after synthesis and folding the fastest molecules are secreted in about 15 min. with the half-life of secretion being 40 min. [38]. The resulting consensus for soluble secreted proteins is that transport is not signal-mediated, relatively fast and follows a default bulk flow pathway from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane.",

As discussed above there are two membrane trafficking steps to arrive at the plasma membrane: from the ER to the Golgi and from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Following the proposal of the bulk-flow hypothesis, a number of groups demonstrated that ER export of transmembrane proteins is at least somewhat signal-mediated [36,[39], [40], [41]]. After arrival at the Golgi, membrane proteins need to sort to their final destination. Transport from the Golgi apparatus was hypothesised to be selectively mediated by clathrin after the discovery of the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex [[42], [43], [44]]. Studies using a type-I membrane-spanning protein, the cation-independent mannose-6 phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), demonstrated that mutations in the cytoplasmic terminus cause retention in the Golgi apparatus [45]. It was later shown that monomeric GGA clathrin adaptors also play a role at the Golgi apparatus and are essential for export of CI-MPR [46,47]. Therefore, there are two clathrin adaptor complexes at the Golgi which selectively sort cargo in a signal mediated manner.",

The mechanism of Golgi retention was investigated by making a series of chimeras made of two integral membrane proteins: a Golgi localised protein (\u03b2-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GT)) and an endosomal protein (human invariant chain (Ii)) [48]. A chimera with the transmembrane domain of GT and the cytoplasmic and lumenal domain of Ii is retained in the Golgi, demonstrating that the transmembrane domain alone can mediate Golgi localisation [48]. Similarly, chimeras of the transmembrane domain of the Golgi-localised \u03b1-2,6-sialyltransferase (ST) with the cell surface protein dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) are Golgi retained [49]. ST fusions with the transmembrane domain replaced with either 17 or 23 leucines localises to the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane respectively. This effect was only observed, however, when the lumenal domain of ST was also in the chimera [49,50]. Additionally, a type-I membrane protein (CD8) with a transmembrane domain of 23 leucine residues accumulates on the plasma membrane, whereas the same fusion with 17 leucines accumulates on the Golgi apparatus [50]. The relationship between transmembrane domain length and localisation was also analysed using temperature sensitive VSV-G (described in Section 4, below) [51]. A 7 amino acid truncation of the transmembrane domain of VSV-G causes less efficient Golgi export.",

The E1 glycoprotein is a triple-pass transmembrane protein (with the C-terminus in the cytoplasm). Replacing the transmembrane domain of VSV-G with the first transmembrane domain of E1 mislocalises VSV-G to the Golgi apparatus [53]. Another example, from plants, is the vacuolar transmembrane protein \u03b1-TIP which accumulates on the vacuolar membrane of tobacco leaf cells despite deletion of the cytosolic terminus [54]. Truncations of the transmembrane domain of \u03b1-TIP resulted in protein accumulation at the Golgi. This suggests that the length of the transmembrane domain is a determining factor for post-Golgi sorting, a finding supported by other studies in plants [36,55]. These observations were further corroborated in mammals by comparing the length of an extensive list of over 1000 single-pass membrane proteins with a known localisation. Proteins known to reside on the plasma membrane have, on average, a longer hydrophobic section when compared to Golgi localised proteins [56].",

One subset of proteins return in COPI vesicles back to the ER. This includes the soluble resident ER chaperones that are \u2018rescued\u2019 from the cis Golgi stacks by the KDEL receptor, to allow steady-state localisation in the ER [63,64]. A second subset includes the Golgi resident enzymes that are retained in the Golgi apparatus [65]. These Golgi resident enzymes are thought to be retained by a combination of active sorting and oligomerisation (reviewed: [65]). The third subset traffic in clathrin-coated vesicles from the Golgi apparatus. These vesicles traffic directly to the endolysosomal system and contain lysosomal hydrolases and their receptors [59]. This process is mediated by the clathrin monomeric GGA adaptors and AP-1 complex which bind to both a motif in the cytosolic termini of the transmembrane cargos and accessory proteins present on the trans-Golgi [66].

To understand what machinery was involved in the formation of these membrane carriers budding from the Golgi, the well-characterised clathrin-mediated transport seemed an obvious candidate to investigate. Clathrin carriers range from the typical spherical 60-100 nm clathrin-coated vesicles to larger, up to 1200 nm in size, grape-like structures displaying several coated buds [68]. The clathrin coat and its accessory protein complex, AP-1, was also shown to drive the formation of Weibel-Palade bodies, large cigar-shaped secretory organelles produced by endothelial cells which can be up to 5 \u03bcm long [69,70]. It has been proposed that the diverse array of carrier morphologies could be an adaptive mechanism for a variety cargo size or abundance. In the same line, COPII coat, which mediates cargo transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, can adopt more flexible conformations than the conventional 80 nm COPII carriers and assemble into tubular structures [71] or even potentially compartment-to-compartment tunnels [72] to allow the transport of large cargos like procollagen. In addition, cargos could potentially also affect the architecture of the Golgi. For example, overexpression of uroplakins, proteins that follow the conventional trafficking route from Golgi to PM localising on the apical surface of urothelial cells, triggers the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus [73]. This effect suggests an adaptation of the cell in response to an increased flux of secretory proteins.",

            "text": "In addition to the various clathrin carriers that bud from the Golgi apparatus, there is a second class of carriers often referred to as a \u2018pleomorphic tubular-vesicular carriers\u2019. These are lipid tubules and vesicles that bud from the Golgi apparatus, and are heterogeneous in size and shape in contrast to a clathrin-coated vesicle, which are generally geometrically constrained by the clathrin lattice. In contrast, pleomorphic tubular-vesicular carriers that traffic from the Golgi apparatus directly to the plasma membrane seem devoid of coat [75]. Studies on temperature sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) mutant strains revealed a subset which had a mutation in the envelope \u2018G\u2019 protein of the virus. This protein has incomplete glycosylation at the non-permissive temperature [76], and was shown by cellular fractionation to localise at a different site in the cell depending on the temperature [77]. Cells infected with the temperature sensitive mutant strain retain the G protein in the ER and, upon temperature shift, traffic the protein towards the PM [78]. This effect is recapitulated with overexpression of a cDNA clone of the mutant protein [79] allowing for an ectopically expressed tsVSV-G that misfolds and accumulates in the ER at the \u2018non-permissive\u2019 temperature of 40 \u00b0C. Accumulated tsVSV-G is released en masse when the cells are shifted to the permissive temperature. This en masse export allows observation of tsVSV-G as it traffics to the plasma membrane, either biochemically or by imaging fluorophore fusions. Visualisation of tsVSV-G-GFP as it buds from the Golgi revealed tubular carriers that bud from the Golgi apparatus and traffic to the plasma membrane [80,81].",

Arf1 is also important in the budding of a large variety of other coated vesicles, recruiting adaptor protein complexes like AP1, AP3, AP4 as well as GGA, and exomer complexes [91,92]. Arf1 forms a dimer in its GTP-bound form which is crucial to induce positive membrane curvature in vitro [93]. A mutant of Arf1 that is unable to dimerise is not able to induce COPI vesicle formation. Arf1, therefore, seems to induce membrane bending by forming a dimer in order to generate vesicles. This property of Arf1 prompted Rothman\u2019s laboratory to investigate its role in the generation of Golgi-derived tubules [94]. Halo-tagged Arf1 was imaged at endogenous expression levels with super-resolution imaging and, only under these conditions (not by over-expression of Arf1) Arf1 labels transient tubular carriers emerging from the Golgi. Arf1 GTPase activity is required for the formation of these tubular carriers. There are at least two distinct populations of Arf1-containing tubules. A subset of these tubules, containing VSV-G, traffic along microtubules in an anterograde direction towards the cell periphery. Arf1 positive carriers, however, were not observed fusing directly to the plasma membrane implying that they either lose Arf1 before fusion or there is an additional trafficking step [94].",

Incubating these membranes with the Arf1 inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) causes loss of Arf1, cortactin and dynamin 2 from the membranes, which can be inhibited by supplementation with GTP-loaded Arf1 [95]. Imaging experiments show addition of brefeldin A causes loss of cortactin and dynamin 2 from the Golgi, suggesting that Arf1 is able to recruit actin, cortactin and dynamin 2 to the trans-Golgi. Finally, the expression of truncated cortactin proteins decreases the efficiency of tsVSV-G export from the TGN towards the cell surface. Cortactin promotes the formation of branched actin polymers through interactions with the Arp2/3 complex [96], and dynamin 2 is a small GTPase essential for membrane fission [97]. These findings show the importance of Arf1 in the recruitment of an actin/cortactin/dynamin 2 complex essential for post-Golgi transport.",

Addition of the metabolite ilimaquinone causes Golgi fragmentation by activating PKD through stimulation of a heterotrimeric G protein (G\u03b2\u03b3) [100]. An inactive mutant of PKD, expressed at moderate levels in a stable HeLa cell line at 20 \u00b0C, inhibits protein transport from the trans-Golgi to the cell surface by causing Golgi tubulation [101]. Cargo destined for the plasma membrane like tsVSV-G are trapped in large tubules that remain attached to the TGN. Similarly, depletion of PRKD2 and PRKD3 (human homologs of PKD) by siRNA also inhibits TGN-to-cell surface transport and shows cargo accumulation in large tubules [102]. These results strongly suggest that PKD is required for membrane fission at the trans-Golgi of carriers destined for the cell surface. PKD has two cysteine-rich domains at the N-terminus, one interacts with diacylglycerol and the second one with Arf1 [103,104]. The direct interaction of PKD2 with ARF1 is enhanced when the small GTPase is in its active conformation [104]. PKD is activated by G\u03b2\u03b3 to stimulate specific lipid kinases like the enzyme PI(4)KIII\u00df [98,100]. This promotes the production of PI(4)P, a crucial lipid that drives vesicle biogenesis at the TGN through a variety of mechanisms [105] - see also Section 7 below.",

            "text": "FAPP1 and FAPP2 were originally identified to bind specifically to PI(4)P through their PH domain [106,107]. Pull-down experiments with isolated Golgi membranes and with recombinant proteins show a direct interaction of FAPP proteins with Arf1-GTP [107]. Binding to both PI(4)P and Arf1 allows FAPP targeting to the trans-Golgi via coincidence detection. It was proposed that FAPP proteins are able to deform membranes [[108], [109], [110]]. Recombinant FAPP2, as well as the isolated PH domain of FAPP1, are able to induce tubulation of membrane sheets in vitro [108,110]. During imaging of synchronised transport of tsVSV-G, FAPP proteins localise on tubular carriers emerging from the TGN [107]. Knockdown of FAPPs by siRNA inhibits cargo delivery to the plasma membrane, indicating that FAPP proteins are essential for the constitutive post-Golgi transport. Furthermore, FAPP2 is specifically involved in apical transport in polarised MDCK cells [111]. FAPP2 has a similar domain structure to FAPP1 aside from an additional glycolipid-transfer-protein-homology domain at its C-terminus. FAPP2 specifically transfers glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in vitro and this transfer is stimulated in the presence of PI(4)P and Arf1 [112]. GlcCer is normally trans-Golgi localised, however in FAPP2 knock-down cells GlcCer is mislocalised to the cis-Golgi. As GlyCer is a precursor for glycosphingolipids which are key components of the plasma membrane, this role of FAPP2 connects tubule formation, PI(4)P generation, and subsequent FAPP2 recruitment at the Golgi with plasma membrane homeostasis.",

By fusing a protein of interest to streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) and co-expressing an ER localised streptavidin, RUSH allows the protein of interest to accumulate in the ER due to the interaction between the streptavidin and the SBP [118]. Addition of exogenous biotin outcompetes the interaction between the SBP and streptavidin leaving the protein of interest free to traffic along its normal trafficking itinerary. By combining this approach with high-resolution microscopy to track the secretion of different endolysosomal proteins, Lamp1 was shown to sort into distinct Golgi domains when compared to the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor or sortillin [59]. Lamp1 leaves the Golgi in tubular carriers depending on the transmembrane and lumenal domains of Lamp1 but independently of sorting signals in the cytosolic tail. Finally, microscopy experiments show that Lamp1 tubular carriers that contain transferrin receptor and VSV-G, fuse directly with the plasma membrane. RUSH of VSV-G shows that VSV-G concentrates in Lamp1 carriers, suggesting that these carriers correspond to the tsVSV-G Golgi-to-PM carriers discussed above. The route of endogenous LAMP1 from the Golgi remains controversial as immunoelectron microscopy studies suggest that a fraction of these non-clathrin coated Lamp1 carriers travel instead directly to late endosomes and contain the HOPS component Vps41 and the SNARE VAMP7 which are both required for fusion [119].",

TIRF experiments show the direct fusion of these Rab6 secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, Rab6 knockdown delays the secretion of VSV-G, implying a role of Rab6 in the transport of the carriers to the cell periphery. The microtubule motors kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and dynein are also important for the delivery of the carriers [120]. A few years later, an unexpected role of Rab6 in the fission of these Rab6 secretory carriers was highlighted [121]. Long tubular carriers connected to the Golgi and seemingly unable to detach have been observed by Live cell imaging when cells are depleted of Rab6A, or its isoform Rab6A`. Pulldown experiments show that Rab6 interacts in vivo with myosin II and the direct interaction was observed with purified proteins. Inhibition or depletion of myosin II in different cell types prevents the fission of Rab6 secretory carriers which form long tubules connected to the Golgi apparatus. Therefore, myosin II has an important role at the Golgi in the fission step of secretory carriers. Further investigations show that myosin II works with F-actin filaments for vesicle fission since actin depolymerization leads to the formation of long tubules [121]. Altogether, this work shows that Rab6 is also associated with a subset tsVSV-G enriched post-Golgi tubular carriers and unravels a novel function of Rab GTPases in vesicle fission.",

            "text": "Brefeldin A (BFA) is a small molecule originally isolated from fungi that has been demonstrated to inhibit the Arf1 exchange factor, GBF1 [123]. As Arf1 is essential to Golgi structure and function, extended incubation with BFA leads to Golgi disassembly [124]. While investigating the molecular factors involved in the Golgi disassembly induced by BFA, the protein CtBP1-S/BARS, also known as CtBP3/BARS (C-terminus binding protein 3/BFA adenosine diphosphate\u2013ribosylated substrate), was identified [125]. Isolated Golgi membranes are fragmented when incubated with either recombinant or rat brain purified CtBP1-S/BARS [126]. Co-incubation of CtBP1-S/BARS on Golgi membranes with various lipids demonstrated that CtBP1-S/BARS acts as a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase to promote generation of phosphatidic acid on the membrane of the Golgi. Microinjection of CtBP1-S/BARS increases the number of post-Golgi carriers. tsVSV-G TGN-exit assays show that CtBP1-S/BARS is recruited to the Golgi and associates with tsVSV-G enriched post-Golgi carriers [127]. Microinjection of an anti-CtBP1-S/BARS antibody or siRNA experiments against CtBP1-S/BARS blocks the delivery of tsVSV-G carriers to the plasma membrane, whereas inhibition of dynamin 2 has no detectable effect [128]. Thus, CtBP1-S/BARS is hypothesised to be essential for membrane fission in a dynamin 2 independent mechanism. As the small GTPase dynamin 2 has been shown to be essential for the fission of Arf1 tubular carriers (section 5.1) and clathrin coated vesicles [129], this is a novel cellular fission mechanism.",

A non-toxic reporter, EQ-SM was used to monitor intracellular trafficking of SM along the biosynthetic pathway from the lumenal side of the membrane. Proximity biotinylation identified new proteins associated with the SM secretory carriers [133]. EQ-SM (or a control protein that does not bind SM) was fused to the promiscuous biotin ligase APEX2 and expressed in HeLa cells. Cells were permeabilized and incubated with rat liver cytosol and an ATP regenerating system to generate Golgi-derived vesicles. APEX2-mediated biotinylation was then induced on vesicle fractions. Biotin-labelled proteins were isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. SM-rich secretory vesicles contain lysozyme C and GPI-anchored proteins and are highly enriched in Cab45 (calcium-binding protein 45), a lumenal Golgi resident protein important for soluble cargo sorting in a calcium dependent manner [134,135].",

The lumenal flux of calcium triggers the oligomerisation of the soluble Golgi localised protein, Cab45 [134,138]. As Cab45 binds to certain secreted cargoes (eg. lysozyme C), in a calcium dependent manner, the oligomerisation leads to sorting into secretory carriers. Interestingly, SiRNA experiments show that Cab45 affects the export of endogenous cargos such as the cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP) [134]. Additionally, deletion of SPCA1 reduced the number of SM carriers [133] and RUSH assays show that secretion of lysozyme C containing vesicles are significantly reduced in SPCA1 null cells, which can be rescued by recovery of SPCA1. Furthermore, SPCA1 associates with SM in Golgi membranes and Golgi calcium influx assays show that depletion of SM impairs the TGN calcium uptake by SPCA1. In summary, SPCA1 links sphingomyelin synthesis to calcium/Cab45-dependent cargo sorting in the trans-Golgi.",

            "text": "In a series of experiments purifying post-Golgi carriers, a new class of secretory carriers named CARTS (CARriers of the TGN to the cell Surface) was discovered [140]. Partial permeabilisation of HeLa cells and the use of an ATP regenerating system allowed the formation and purification of post-Golgi vesicles. Isolation and analysis of these carriers indicate that CARTS are devoid of collagen and tsVSV-G but enriched in endogenous proteins such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor (PAUF), lysozyme C, synaptotagmin II (SYT2), Rab6A, and Rab8A [140]. Earlier experiments had shown that protein kinase D (PKD) was essential for forming tubular carriers at the trans-Golgi [101], as discussed in Section 5.1. Knock-down of PKD resulted in extended CARTS tubules from the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, vesicle-associated membrane protein\u2013associated proteins (VAP-A/B) regulate CARTS formation upstream of PKD [141]. Interestingly, expression of an OSBP construct (PH-FFAT) which immobilises ER-Golgi contact sites, drastically reduced CARTS production and PAUF secretion [141,142], suggesting a key role of ER-Golgi contact sites in the generation of post-Golgi carriers. Similarly, FAPP1, localised at ER-Golgi contact sites, controls the level of PI(4)P at the trans-Golgi and regulates the secretion of the endogenous cargo ApoB100 [143]. Finally, the kinesin protein Eg5, well known for its role in bipolar spindle assembly during mitosis, has a role in the transport of CARTS toward the cell surface along microtubules [144].",

TIRF imaging in insulin-producing cells shows ELKS foci on the exocytic fusion pore, supporting a role in regulated secretion [152,153]. ELKS was identified as a Rab6 interactor [147]. An accumulation in Rab6 positive vesicular structures was observed after ELKS depletion [120], later shown to be positive for MICAL3 and Rab8 [154]. MICAL3 and Rab8 interact with each other and MICAL3 with ELKS, hinting at a functional complex for exocytosis. ARHGEF10, an exchange factor for RhoA has been shown to localise to Rab6/Rab8 positive carriers and is required for Rab8 recruitment suggesting that there is a small G protein cascade leading to carrier fusion [155,156]. The soluble biosynthetic cargo neuropeptide Y accumulates in pre-fusion ELKS dependent carriers, suggesting that this is the biosynthetic transport route [120].

As NSF is essential for SNARE function these experiments demonstrated that SNARE machinery is essential for fusion of the carriers. A targeted siRNA screen identified the specific SNAREs and SM (Sec1/Munc18-like) proteins which help to organise the SNAREs [168]. 38 SNAREs, 4 SNARE\u2010like proteins and 7 SM proteins were targeted, 9 of which were identified and validated as being strongly inhibitory to secretory exocytosis. These 9 hits included proteins for both the ER to Golgi transport step and Golgi to plasma membrane step. Candidate validation identified the SNAREs SNAP29 and syntaxin-19. SNAP29 has both a Qb- and Qc-SNARE domain [169], and syntaxin-19 is Qa-SNARE [170]. Depletion of both syntaxin-19 and SNAP29 decreased plasma membrane fusion events of secretory vesicles, additionally in SNAP29 depleted cells there was an accumulation of pre-fusion carriers in the cytosol. Surprisingly no R-SNAREs were identified in this screen [168].",

GOLPH3 binds to the unconventional myosin MYO18A thus connecting the Golgi to F-actin. The model suggests that this complex applies tension to extract the carriers at the trans-Golgi. Knock-down of GOLPH3 or MYO18A or actin depolymerisation impairs trafficking of tsVSV-G from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Additionally, GOLPH3 induces membrane curvature, by inserting a loop into the proximal leaflet of the bilayer and this property is required for efficient trans-Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking [179]. However, GOLPH3 has also been shown to specifically bind and recycle a subset of Golgi enzymes involved in glycan assembly on sphingolipids [180]. This role of GOLPH3 matches the role of its yeast homolog Vps74 which binds to PI(4)P at the trans-Golgi and interacts with specific Golgi enzymes allowing their retrograde transport [181,182].",

These proteins share a similar domain organisation: an N-terminal PH domain that binds PI(4)P (and simultaneously Arf1-GTP for OSBP and FAPP2), a C-terminal FFAT motif that binds the ER membrane protein VAP and a C-terminal lipid transport domain. FAPP2 transfers GlcCer to the trans-Golgi [112] as described in section 5.1 above. At membrane contact sites, OSBP directs cholesterol transfer from the ER to the trans-Golgi through coupled counter-transport of PI(4)P [142,186]. CERT transports ceramide from the ER to the trans-Golgi [187], thereby promoting SM and diacylglycerol synthesis. Sterols and sphingolipids, which are suggested to assemble into lipid microdomains are important for the formation of secretory carriers [132,188]. In agreement, depletion of VAP inhibits trans-Golgi to plasma membrane transport of tsVSV-G [189]. Similarly, VAP knockdown, double knockdown of CERT/OSBP or the treatment of the cells with D-ceramide-C6, impairs the secretion of the cargo PAUF [141].",

The PI(4)-kinase Pik1, responsible for PI(4)P synthesis at the trans-Golgi, regulates several transport events including the Golgi to surface route [192]. Together with the activated RabGTPase Ypt32, PI(4)P recruits the exchange factor Sec2 to the trans-Golgi which in turn activates another Rab, Sec4 [193,194]. The secretory vesicles subsequently pinch off and Sec4 recruits the exocyst component Sec15 to promote the tethering and fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane [195,196]. PI(4)P, Ypt32-GTP, Sec4-GTP and then Sec15 recruit Myo2, a type V myosin, to allow the transport of vesicles along actin cables toward the exocytic site [[197], [198], [199]]. Additionally, Sec2 is able to bind directly to the Sec4 effector Sec15 [200]. Sec15 and Ypt32-GTP compete for binding to Sec2. Also, the association of Sec2 with its alternate binding partners is regulated by PI(4)P [193]. Thus, when secretory vesicles are initially formed and enriched in PI(4)P, Sec2 interacts with its initial binding partner Ypt32-GTP. It was shown that the concentration of PI(4)P on secretory vesicles is reduced by the time of their arrival at the cell surface [193,201] by the action of the protein Osh4 [201]. This suggests that during the maturation of secretory vesicles, as the PI(4)P concentration drops, Ypt32-GTP is replaced on Sec2 by Sec15 leading to a positive feedback loop and thus preparing the vesicles for docking and fusion with the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "Furthermore, an additional regulatory level is accomplished by the phosphorylation of Sec2 by casein kinases Yck1/Yck2 [202,203]. Sec2 phosphorylation inhibits its interaction with its initial binding partners PI(4)P and Ypt32-GTP and promotes its interaction with its downstream effector Sec15. Additionally, Yck2 binds to Sec2 near the PI(4)P binding region and the presence of PI(4)P inhibits phosphorylation of Sec2 by Yck2 in vitro [202,203]. This suggests that phosphorylation of Sec2 is initially prevented by the high level of PI(4)P in nascent secretory vesicles. As the secretory vesicle matures and the PI(4)P level drops, Sec2 gets phosphorylated promoting the switch in Sec2 binding partners and thus pushing the reaction forwards. Altogether, this complex regulatory circuit helps to impose a directionality in vesicular transport and shows the key role of PI(4)P in the secretory route. This Rab cascade is somewhat conserved in mammalian cells and involves the Ypt32-homologue Rab11 recruiting the exchange factor Rabin8 to activate the Sec4-homologue Rab8 [204]. There are some differences, however, for example the lipid phosphatidylserine participating in the Golgi recruitment of Rabin8 in mammalian cells instead of PI(4)P in yeast [205].",

It is possible that tsVSV-G takes multiple routes from the Golgi apparatus (fig, 2), which makes the number of routes that leave the Golgi hard to interpret. Similarly, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) traffic to the apical surface of most epithelial cells, however, there are some exceptions such as Fischer rat thyroid cells where GPI-APs are sorted to the basolateral surface [213]. In Fig. 2, the schematic shows the various carriers that have been shown experimentally. It is of course possible, for example, that the Rab6 carriers and Lamp1-RUSH carriers shown in the image are the same. One reason for multiple pathways from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane is due to polarised sorting in some cell types. Examples of polarised cells are epithelial tissues such as the choroid plexus that makes up a portion of the blood-brain barrier and is responsible for the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Neurons, another polarised cell type, are characterised by a long axonal process, reaching a meter in length in humans.",

The generation, maintenance and trafficking of cell polarity has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [[214], [215], [216]]. The machinery that mediates the sorting into the two different routes is still being characterised. It seems likely that some of the machinery discussed in this review is essential, for example loss of FAPP2 in MDCK cells causes loss of complete polarisation and defective cilium formation and is important for delivery of apical cargos [111,217]. It is possible that the routes that exist in polarised cells also exist in \u2018non-polarised\u2019 cells and act as redundant or alternative routes to the plasma membrane, as demonstrated in comparisons of trafficking non-polarised Fao cells with polarised WIF-B cells [218].",

In the case of clathrin coated vesicles it is a geometric lattice that directly forms and scaffolds the forming vesicles, in the retromer coat it is a core complex that allows for cargo selectivity and binding to other machinery. Although, as discussed above, there are some candidate proteins, there is still no bona fide coat for the secretory carriers. Perhaps there is no need for a coat in these carriers or perhaps it has yet to be discovered. With the recent advances in genetics and proteomics there is surely more to be discovered on this elusive trafficking pathway.",
