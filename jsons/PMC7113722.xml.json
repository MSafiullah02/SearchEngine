HTLV-1 originated from a simian retrovirus called simian T-leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1), which is widespread in Old World monkey and ape species. The idea that HTLV-1 originated from STLV-1 is mainly based on the very high sequence homology (African subtypes b, d, e, f) found between some STLV-1 strains and HTLV-1 found in individuals, including hunters, living in Central/West Africa. However, data concerning transmission of STLV-1 to humans in natura and modes of acquisition remain quite scarce.

The virus is highly endemic to central Australia where more than half of all indigenous adults residing in some remote communities are infected. Infection is associated with a rapidly progressive haematological malignancy (adult T-cell leukemia, ATL), inflammatory diseases involving various organ systems and an increased likelihood and severity of other infections, notably with Strongyloides stercoralis. In central Australia, each of the major HTLV-1-associated diseases has been described; however, in this setting HTLV-1 infection is most often associated with chronic respiratory disease, including life-threatening, severe bronchiectasis, and with invasive bacterial infections (Einsiedel et al., 2012). The region has the highest reported prevalence of adult bronchiectasis, and among the highest bloodstream infection incidence rates, worldwide. The risk of bronchiectasis and the extent of pulmonary injury are strongly associated with the HTLV-1 proviral load (pVL), which also predicts risk of invasive bacterial infection. The association between HTLV-1 pVL and these life-threatening conditions is consistent with recent findings that higher HTLV-1 pVL are associated with an increased risk of death in a large prospective cohort of Indigenous adults (Einsiedel et al., 2016). High rates of HTLV-1 infection and HTLV-1-associated diseases contribute substantially to the burden of ill health and early mortality among indigenous people in central Australia.",

Bangham (Imperial College, U.K.) noted that HTLV-1 causes disabling chronic inflammatory diseases or an aggressive, rapidly fatal malignancy, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, in about 10% of infected people. In addition, HTLV-1 predisposes to and exacerbates infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Strongyloides stercoralis and Staphylococcus aureus, with severe and sometimes fatal consequences. It has recently been shown that HTLV-1 also causes and exacerbates bronchiectasis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis. The risk of these HTLV-1-associated diseases is strongly correlated with the proviral load, which frequently exceeds 10% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The virus, which is non-cytolytic, drives proliferation of the infected CD4+ T cell, and the high proviral load is limited by a strong, chronically activated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to HTLV-1. Until recently, it was believed that HTLV-1 persisted in vivo chiefly by continuous oligoclonal proliferation of about 100 clones of HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. However, Bangham and colleagues have shown that a typical individual carries between 104 and 105 clones, and the proviral load \u2013 the chief correlate of disease \u2013 is determined by the number of clones, not by oligoclonal proliferation. It was also believed that HTLV-1 was latent in vivo, but the existence of the persistently activated CTL response in virtually all hosts strongly argues that the virus is not latent but is frequently expressed. This suggests that the virus undergoes intermittent bursts of expression in vivo.",

Work is under way to identify the factors that regulate the frequency, size and duration of these bursts. In addition, spontaneous reactivation of HTLV-1 from latency in fresh PBMCs is governed by the molecular oxygen availability and by glycolysis. Finally, he and colleagues discovered that HTLV-1 alters host chromatin structure in the infected cell, by binding the chromatin architectural protein CTCF, which regulates higher-order chromatin structure and gene expression in vertebrates. This observation implies that HTLV-1 does a remarkable experiment of nature, by changing the conformation of chromatin in tens of thousands of different ways in each infected host (Satou et al., 2016). Studies are under way to test the hypotheses that CTCF regulates HTLV-1 latency, and that the abnormal chromatin looping caused by CTCF can deregulate host gene expression and so may act as an oncogenic driver.",

In the first decade of 2000, groups of Japanese patients with HTLV-1-associated diseases petitioned the government for improved health care and treatment, as well as continuous and strong support for clinical and basic research. In 2010, the government organized a HTLV-1 Task Force composed of the Prime Minister and government officials, representatives of patient groups, and medical specialists. Subsequently, a nationwide campaign began in 2011 with screening for HTLV-1 antibody in all pregnant women to prevent new mother-to-child transmissions. Counseling also was initiated for HTLV-1 carriers and HAM/ATL patients. Some of the results of stepped-up government support for HTLV-1 research and care have been reported (Satake et al., 2016; Nosaka et al., 2017).",

            "text": "\nLinfa Wang (Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore) presented a review of his 20 years of research on the importance of bats as natural reservoir of viruses. Specifically, he addressed three questions:1.Are bats true reservoirs of emerging viruses? Since the discovery of rabies virus in bats more than 100 years ago, bats have been known to carry zoonotic viruses. But the field remained relatively \u201cquiet\u201d until the discovery of Hendra virus in Australian bats, which was responsible for lethal outbreaks in horses and humans. Since then, bats have been confirmed or suspected as reservoirs of several emerging viruses, including Nipah, SARS, MERS, Ebola and Marburg viruses. Although scientists working in this field still debate whether bats are the true reservoir of Ebola virus, for example, Wang pointed out that it took an international collaborative team more than ten years to obtain convincing evidence of the bat origin of the SARS coronavirus (Ge et al., 2013).2.Are bats special in their ability to host viruses? There are two working hypotheses associated with this question. First, it is difficult to induce experimental infections in bats with many viruses lethal to humans and livestock. Second, bats can harbor more viruses on a per species basis and there is a greater genetic diversity of viruses in bats than in other mammals. Evidence has been gathered to support these hypotheses, although most of them are based on retrospective studies of past literature. The most significant study examined a database of 2805 mammal-virus associations and concluded that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than any other mammalian order (Olival et al., 2017).3.What makes bats special? Wang noted that bats have a long lifespan and are less prone to cancer. He hypothesized that the evolutionary adaptation to flight has resulted in a unique immune system significantly different from terrestrial mammals. He presented genomic data indicating a more robust positive selection of genes responsible for DNA damage pathways (Zhang et al., 2013). The most recently data obtained from his group suggests that the overall dampening of inflammatory responses may be key to why bats can carry so many viruses, yet seldom develop symptomatic infections.\n",

While it is known that the mammalian genome is composed of up to 11% endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs), most of them completed their invasion millions of years ago obscuring the changes in virus and host associated with them. The koala retrovirus (KoRV) is one of the few examples of a virus that is currently in the earliest stages of transitioning from an exogenous retrovirus to an ERV (Tarlinton et al., 2006). By going through a collection of archived samples of modern wild and zoo koalas dating back to 1891, Greenwood and his collaborators found crucial early events in endogenization involving recombination, often mediated by existing retroviral-like elements already resident in the host genome. These recombination events disable the exogenous retrovirus making it less potentially harmful to the host while at the same time, the ancient retroviral-like elements may re-establish themselves as actively propagating retroelements (Hobbs et al., 2017). In the context of trying to find the origin of KoRV, Greenwood, et al. confirmed its close relationship to the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV). Both are likely from recent interspecies transmissions.",

As the environment of the endosome becomes more acidic, the viral hemagglutinin (HA) undergoes a conformational change to reveal a hydrophobic fusion region that penetrates the endosomal membrane, thus initiating the life cycle of virus replication inside the cell. Candidate drug molecules use an attachment domain that binds to HA, and an effector domain that provides a negatively-charged environment to trigger a premature conformational change in the neighbouring HA to prevent viral replication. Brown presented in vivo data on two drugs, MD185 and MD345, that provided better protection in mouse and ferret models than did zanamivir. These constructs appear to provide an extended therapeutic window until the adaptive immune system comes into play.

Hayward and colleagues characterized the megabat (family Pteropodidae) APOBEC3 genes and show that pteropid bats possess the largest and most diverse array of APOBEC3 genes identified in any mammal reported to date. Several bat ABOEC3 proteins have been shown to be capable of restricting retroviral infectivity, using HIV-1 as a model. Hypermutation analysis of the endogenous retroviruses of P. vampyrus support a role for APOBEC3-mediated restriction of ancient bat retroviruses, and a molecular clock analysis indicates that the expansion of APOBEC3 genes coincided with the extinction of pteropid LINE-1 retroelements (Hayward et al., 2013).

However, the distribution of intact proviruses within memory CD4+ T-cell subsets from participants who initiated therapy during either acute or chronic infection showed the proportion of intact provirus was significantly different across cell subsets. Cells expressing the HLA-DR activation marker and effector memory cells contained the highest proportion of intact HIV genomes. In addition, clonal expansions of intact proviruses were identified indicating that proliferating cells contribute to the latent reservoir. The HLA-DR marker identifies cells containing a high frequency of intact HIV genomes; therefore, assays quantifying the persistent HIV reservoir should include these cells. Determining the type of cells and cellular mechanisms contributing to persistent replication-competent HIV is crucial for future efforts aimed at HIV eradication.",

Exposure to an array of communicable diseases is prevalent, and morbidity and mortality are significant. Effective partnerships with local Aboriginal stakeholders are critical to improving knowledge of infectious diseases and developing preventative strategies derived from a well-thought-out research agenda. Mentha described many pressing needs, including: research grounded in the principles of social justice and equity; community consultations and partnerships; building capacity with Aboriginal researchers and community members; and translating findings into policy, practice and health promotion. There are many complexities to address in conducting communicable disease research in remote Aboriginal populations, but it can be done in ethical and culturally sensitive ways that contribute to reducing exposure to poverty-related infectious disease that impact on morbidity and mortality (Brown et al., 2016).",
