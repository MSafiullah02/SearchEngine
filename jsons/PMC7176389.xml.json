Neurological examination was negative, but the infant deteriorated and vomited repeatedly. The head CT scan indicated a shunt disconnection. A chest x-ray was negative for overt interstitial pneumonia (appendix) and the nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.",
