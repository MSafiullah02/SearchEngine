Regarding Portugal, a suppression strategy with social distancing was adopted, attempting to break the transmission chains, bending the epidemy curve and reducing mortality. These measures seek to prevent an eventual National Health Service over-running, enforcing the suspension of all elective and non-urgent health care. Despite the success in so far, there is a consensus on the need to recover the previous level of health care provision and further enhance it. The Portuguese National Health Service, as a public, universal access, health care system funded by the State proved, in this context, its importance and relevance to the Portuguese population. However, long standing issues, such as the pre pandemic over long waiting lists for hospital ophthalmology attendance, whose determinants are fully identified but still unmet, emerge amplified from this pandemic. The lack of primary eye care in the National Health Service is a significant bottleneck, placing a huge stress on hospital-based care. An exclusive ophthalmologist's centre care was over-runned before pandemic and will be even more so. The optometrist's exclusion from differentiated, multisectoral and multidisciplinary eye care teams remains the main hurdle to overcome and insure universal eye care in Portugal. National Health Service highlights the consequences of an overcome model. Universal eye care more than ever demands an evidence-based, integrated approach with primary eye care, in the community, on time and of proximity.",

En Portugal, se ha adoptado una estrategia de contenci\u00f3n basada en el distanciamiento social, con la cual se ha intentado cortar las cadenas de transmisi\u00f3n, frenar la curva de la epidemia y reducir la mortalidad. Con estas medidas se trataba de evitar un eventual desbordamiento del Servicio Nacional de Salud y se impon\u00eda la suspensi\u00f3n de toda la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica programada, que no fuera urgente. A pesar del \u00e9xito logrado hasta este momento, existe consenso sobre la necesidad de recuperar el nivel anterior de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica y fomentar su mejora. El Servicio Nacional de Salud de Portugal, como sistema sanitario p\u00fablico y de acceso universal, a cargo del Estado, ha demostrado, en este contexto, su importancia y pertinencia para la poblaci\u00f3n portuguesa. Sin embargo, los problemas que acarrea desde hace mucho tiempo, como las largas listas de espera, anteriores a la pandemia, en la asistencia oftalmol\u00f3gica hospitalaria, cuyos factores determinantes est\u00e1n completamente identificados, pero que contin\u00faan sin soluci\u00f3n, se han visto agravados a resultas de esta pandemia. La falta de atenci\u00f3n primaria oftalmol\u00f3gica en el Servicio Nacional de Salud es un importante cuello de botella, que ejerce una enorme presi\u00f3n en la atenci\u00f3n hospitalaria. La atenci\u00f3n de un centro exclusivamente oftalmol\u00f3gico estaba desbordada antes de la pandemia y lo estar\u00e1 a\u00fan m\u00e1s despu\u00e9s de esta. La exclusi\u00f3n de los opt\u00f3metras de los equipos de atenci\u00f3n oftalmol\u00f3gica diferenciados, multisectoriales y multidisciplinarios contin\u00faa siendo el principal obst\u00e1culo que debe superar y asegurar la atenci\u00f3n oftalmol\u00f3gica universal en Portugal. El Servicio Nacional de Salud hace hincapi\u00e9 en las consecuencias de un modelo superado. La atenci\u00f3n oftalmol\u00f3gica universal exige, m\u00e1s que nunca, un enfoque integral basado en la evidencia para abordar la atenci\u00f3n primaria oftalmol\u00f3gica en la comunidad, puntual y de proximidad.",

A zero-growth rate in the COVID-19 incidence is compatible with the effectiveness of measures of distancing and social isolation, as well as of the measures of hygiene and respiratory etiquette. Still, the growth in the prevalence continues, and although the data supports the claim that the incidence peak has already been reached, it is yet to be reached the prevalence peak in Portugal. Despite variations in duration, size and phase, the European context is of community spread and virtually all European countries are currently in the community transmission mitigation phase.",

Still, despite how worrying public health situation is, there is a consensus on the need to recover the previous level of health care provision, otherwise the effects of other untreated illness can be even more harmful. Nevertheless, a possible second peak is a circumstance to be considered, as a result of the relaxation of the measures to restrict circulation, internal and external, and less social distancing. It is also important not to lose sight of the fact that the different National Health Services in all countries have been under enormous pressure, not because of the relatively low lethality rate, but above all because of the very high incidence of COVID-19 on the population. Italy's experience, for example, supports the idea that in the case of full use of intensive care resources, the lethality rate increases significantly. Therefore, prudent and informed planning is essential to contain contagion, safeguard health services and consequently limit the lethality rate.",

This implies adjusting organizational and clinical management procedures, individual therapeutic and diagnostic equipment, physical spaces, and management of the circulation of patients and professionals in the spaces of access to the health care facilities. In the eye care provision, protection measures, procedures, and personal protective equipment, acquire special importance in this new context. Similarly, this pandemic situation is further evidence of the direction that health services should follow, focusing on a community and proximity-based care. An approach where primary, timely and preventive care is provided, enhances the first contact between the health provider and the community, in an integrated care provision through all the different health care levels. 14 Thus, it would be possible to filter what can be attended and solved in primary eye care, and leaving the necessary curative and reactive approach to highly specialized, secondary and tertiary care, safeguarding physical and human resources. The differentiation and separation of the current health organizational model, in a real primary or community, secondary or hospital and tertiary care, duly established and communicative bottom to top, would also constitute a barrier in the propagation and contagion of conditions such as COVID-19, without the need to completely suspend the provision of health care. It would allow the sorting patients within the community and in a proximity way, without the typical agglomerations of hospital services and observing the limitations of travel within the system and contact inherent. The significant financial burden borne by the State, inherent to the purely specialized secondary and tertiary services, would also be reduced. By all these arguments, it is important to note that this is a moment of change and to create the formal rationality that the National Health Service has just suffered a temporal division: the prepandemic era and the post-pandemic era.",

The essence of the National Health Service, its mission and its values serve a greater purpose and demonstrate in this context its importance and its relevance to the society, assuming itself as possibly the most important organization at national level. And that is precisely why it is important to highlight the need to provide access to a broad scope of health care services within the National Health Service, to ensure its functionality, its safety, its effectiveness, and its efficiency. Also, National Health Service should be reformed, reorganized, complemented, and adapted to population needs, which are dynamic and changeable over time. All of this, considering differentiated approaches according to population demographic evolution, epidemiological data, and scientific evidence, focusing care on patients and population needs. 15 The lack of primary eye care in the National Health Service and inadequate planning of the eye care workforce are the central constrains, highlighted during and pos pandemic crysis. 15, 16 Also, it is pointed that about sixty percent of the Portuguese eye conditions could be manage at primary care level, since they are technical simple and would free hospital resources from less differentiate tasks. The Portuguese ophthalmologist-only eye care model is known to be ineffective and expensive use of eye care resources, that could be allocated and better used in surgery and pathology management. A comparison with the UK ophthalmologist-optometrist model clearly evidences Portuguese shortcomings. 17 As a result of not implementing the recommendations of the World Health Organization, good practices and scientific evidence, a difficult pre-pandemic situation suddenly escalates to a defiant pandemic and post-pandemic situation. It is enough to consider the elderly on their visits to the hospital to obtain a simple prescription for glasses, knowing that they are in the age group with higher prevalence of refractive errors and also have higher risk of exposure to contagion, and risk of death outcome.",

[18] [19] [20] The same recommendations are made by the World Health Organization and for which there is a global action plan. 16, 21 The creation of primary care platforms for the eye care, properly integrated in the current primary care network, taking advantage of the existing logistics and material resources and using the highly qualified human resources trained nationally by Portuguese universitiesoptometristsis one of the proposed solutions for solving a chronic National Health Service problem 15 and that the pandemic scenario has accentuated. Louren\u00e7o and Pita-Barros study concludes that it will suffice to address in primary eye care only twenty-five percent of all 2018 references to secondary hospital specialty of ophthalmology to immediately eliminated waiting lists. 15 This would provide resolution of primary care conditions, as are refractive errors, accommodative, vergence and oculomotor dysfunctions, as well as the screening and follow-up of pathologies such as retinopathies, would allow a screening of primary care users and immediately solving the problem of most patients. Providing primary eye care from the perspective of proximity and community would minimize the patient travel and waiting time to access the National Health Service, making it safer, more effective, and more efficient. A recently published study shows that the delay in the use of primary eye care provided by optometrists is associated with a greater probability of resorting to General Practitioners, as an indicator of missed opportunities to detect potentially serious eye conditions. It is emphasized that this study reflects on the pre-pandemic period, so the consequences during and postpandemic are expected to be substantially greater. 22",

More than implementing a better cost-benefit practices, which is consensually assumed and accepted, a change is required that protects public health, patients and professionals, that provides care where is needed, when is needed, with reduced contagion exposure and effective, simple and direct response to the patient needs. Scientific evidence, recommendations of relevant organizations and entities and good practices 19, [23] [24] [25] , as well as the analysis of socio-economic impact 15 , are clear and point to the same solution: a National Health Service should be based on a solid primary, differentiated, multisectoral and multidisciplinary care, and with regard to primary eye care, should be provided, by definition, by the optometrist. More important than the reform of the National Health Service, which has proved to be a matter of significant challenge, this period requires a reform of thought and the disconnecting of obsolete and ineffective practices.
