The fraction of time that the unbound drug concentration exceeds the MIC (fT>MIC) for the dosing interval is the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) efficacy target for cefepime [4], and a target of 60\u201374% has been previously proposed [5\u20138]. For the currently approved cefepime product and combination agents in the pipeline [9, 10], understanding cefepime disposition and variability is crucial to for optimal treatment of patients. As inter- and intra-patient PK variability can impact the achievement of PD goals, understanding the precision of population dosing is important. Further, to fully realize precision dosing, individualized models (e.g., Bayesian models) are needed. Once developed, these models will form the basis for adaptive feedback and control strategies when paired with real-time drug assays. The purpose of this study was to: (1) develop and evaluate a unified cefepime population PK model for adult and pediatric patients, and (2) construct an individualized model that can be utilized to deliver precision cefepime dosing.",

Subject demographics and study methodologies have been previously described [11\u201314]. In brief, populations represented were febrile neutropenic adults with hematologic malignancies [13, 14], those with critical illness [12], and children with presumed or documented bacterial infections [11]. For the two studies that evaluated adults with neutropenic fever, Sime et al. prospectively enrolled 12 patients receiving chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplant who subsequently developed febrile neutropenia and were administered maximum doses of cefepime [13]. A total of 53 cefepime plasma concentrations in presumably steady-state dosing intervals (third, sixth, and ninth) were analyzed for PK target attainment. Whited et al. prospectively studied similar patients (n = 9) who were admitted to hematology-oncology services and were receiving cefepime at a maximum dosage for febrile neutropenia [14]. Cefepime PK samples were obtained during steady state and analyzed for population parameters. Critically ill adults were studied by Roberts et al. as a prospective multinational PK study and included 14 patients who received cefepime (only n = 13 were included for model evaluation) [12]. Last, Reed et al. characterized cefepime pharmacokinetics in hospitalized pediatric patients (above 2 months of age) who received cefepime as monotherapy for bacterial infections [11]. For our study, only those who received intravenous cefepime were included for model development.",

Precision medicine has been named as a major focus for the National Health Institute with $215 million invested [27], yet precision medicine has mostly focused on genomic differences [28, 29]. Precision dosing is an important facet of precision medicine, and renewed efforts in precision dosing in the real-world setting are being pursued [30]. Cefepime is a highly relevant example. While rigorous reviews and analyses are conducted during the development phase of an antibiotic, dose optimization is far less ideal for the types of patients who ultimately receive the drug. This is highlighted by the fact that although cefepime-associated neurotoxicity is rare, this serious and potentially life-threatening adverse event has been increasingly reported and few strategies exist for optimizing and delivering precision exposures [31, 32]. Lamoth et al. found that a cefepime trough concentration of \u2265 22 mg/L has a 50% probability of predicting neurotoxicity [33]. Huwyler et al. identified a similar predictive threshold of > 20 mg/dL (five-fold increased risk for neurologic events) [34]. In contrast, Rhodes et al. found the cut-off of 22 mg/L to be suboptimal [35]. Furthermore, Rhodes et al. performed simulations from literature cefepime data and observed a high intercorrelation amongst all PK parameters (i.e., area under the curve at steady state, maximum plasma concentration, and minimum plasma concentration), suggesting that more work is needed to establish the pharmacokinetic/toxicodynamic (PK/TD) profile for cefepime.",

Further, a contemporary dose reduction strategy based on estimated renal function (e.g., estimated CrCL using the Cockcroft\u2013Gault formula) is also likely to be confounded in these patients by intrinsic PK variability, such as changes in volume of distribution, and the challenges of accurately estimating the glomerular filtration rate at any point in time, leading to more \u2018uncertainties\u2019 in balancing dose optimization and adverse events [9, 36]. These \u2018real-world\u2019 patients are often under-represented, and thus not well understood, from a PK/PD and PK/TD standpoint during the drug approval process. Bridging to the more typical patients that are clinically treated is important and central to the mission of precision medicine. The findings of this study can be used to guide cefepime dosing in these \u2018real-world\u2019 patients.",

Sime et al. observed that patients with neutropenic fever had a mean CL of 8.6 L/h and a mean elimination half-life of 2.7 h [13]. Nicasio et al. studied 32 critically ill patients receiving intravenous cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia and observed that means of total CL and elimination half-life (as calculated from mean total CL and mean volume of distribution) were 7.6 L/h and 2.0 h, respectively [37]. The noncompartmental analysis conducted (in the model development adult population) in our study produced similar results (CL, 7.59 L/h; elimination half-life, 2.98 h). Shoji et al. studied 91 pediatric patients and observed a mean of CL of approximately 1.86 L/h and a mean elimination half-life of 3.5 h [38]. In our pediatric population, means of CL and elimination half-life were 3.1 L/h and 3.0 h, respectively. Our simulation findings are similar to those of Shoji et al. that the maximum pediatric cefepime dosing did not adequately achieve optimal exposure to target higher MICs. While the cefepime package labeling recommends maximum dosages of 2 g every 8 h for adult patients with neutropenic fever and 50 mg/kg every 8 h for pediatric patients with pneumonia and/or neutropenic fever, there may be a need to extend these dosing regimens to other populations (in the absence of aforementioned indications) to achieve the best clinical outcomes by optimizing the PK/PD attainment goals [9].",

Tam et al. found that with a PD target of 67% fT>MIC, 2 g every 8 h (30-minute infusion) achieved approximately 90% PTA for MIC of 8 mg/L in patients with CrCL of 120 mL/min while 2 g every 12 h achieved barely above 80% PTA for an MIC of 4 mg/L in the same population [39]. Nicasio et al. also conducted a simulation using a PD target of 50% fT>MIC in the critically ill with varying renal function. The maximum recommended dosage (2 g every 8 h) in patients with CrCL between 50 and 120 mL/min achieved a PTA of 78.1% at an MIC of 16 mg/L; however, when the same regimen was infused over 0.5 h, the PTA achieved was significantly lower [37]. Collectively, these findings suggest that cefepime exposure is highly variable and may be clinically suboptimal in a large number of patients commonly treated with cefepime. These findings support the need for precision dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring for \u03b2-lactam antibiotics to reach optimal PK/PD targets given the high variability in drug exposures.",
