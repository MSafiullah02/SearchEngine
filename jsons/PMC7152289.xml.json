So does the intensity of a certain disease, calculated as incidence, prevalence, mortality, or case fatality. As diseases \u2013 and health status in general \u2013 are largely functions of individual properties, behavior, and environmental circumstances, their spatial distribution will tend to change over time as individuals come and go and as the physical and social environment changes. Infections will spread with people, animals, and things moving from place to place. The distributions of noninfectious diseases will change too, and ostensibly these redistributions will appear as spatial diffusion and waning, but the character of the process will depend on the type of the disease and a multitude of geographically different physical and social circumstances.",

In other words, information about disease occurrence is linked to the individuals. This view is a basis for epidemiology, which measures incidence and prevalence in search of correlations with circumstances that might clarify the etiologies of diseases. The occurrence of disease could thus be considered equivalent with the individuals themselves and from this perspective geographical distribution can be understood as a number of more or less mobile points with varying lifetimes, sometimes appearing in clusters or within more or less clearly distinct regions or zones. This notion has led to important discoveries and progress in epidemiology and medical geography, most notably John Snow's mapping of cholera in Soho (Figure 1\n). The alternative view focuses on the causes, which means that disease occurrence is associated with an area where some potential health hazard prevails. Pathogenic factors may be around, but cases actually occur only when susceptible individuals are exposed to them. This perspective is the basis for identifying risk areas often visualized on maps in vaccination clinics.",

In a more real and personal sense disease occurs once an individual feels ill, which often but not necessarily happens before the diagnosis is made. It is also possible that a disease (e.g., cancer in its early stage) is discovered at a routine screening before the patient has noticed any symptoms. In a wider perspective, a pathogenic process may begin with exposure to circumstances that may eventually lead to a disease. Between exposure or the start of a pathogenic process and the onset of symptoms lies a period of incubation or latency. With influenza, the incubation time is a matter of days, whereas AIDS, which is caused by a lentivirus, has an incubation period of months or years and hepatitis C might cause only mild or no symptoms and therefore remain undetected for decades. With noninfectious diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders, the latency period may be not only years, but even decades. In the meantime, the affected individuals may have moved, which means that the exposure or pathogenic onset may have happened in a different place and a different environment than the place where the case is eventually recorded.

Thus, drug abuse and its health consequences might spread from a metropolitan area to neighboring suburbs because of their proximity before spreading to regional centers and towns further down the urban hierarchy.

Second, diffusion could imply that more individuals are affected within a wider area (i.e., the outer limits of a core area are widened and the process is expansive), for example, as drug abuse spreads from the inner city to the suburbs. Third, diffusion could mean that individuals in other places fall ill. In the latter case, different types of diffusion may be more or less distinguishable. If an epidemic affects one country or continent after another, the extension of the disease is enlarged as more individuals in new places fall ill. Eventually the disease might subside in the locations where it struck first, which would appear as a relocation of the disease, but the individual cases are not relocated. Relocation of cases would imply that affected individuals have moved to other places. This, however, is conceivable with genetically conditioned disorders.",

            "text": "The diffusion process involves numerous events on all spatial levels from intercontinental transport and climatic variations down to households, workplaces, and hospitals. Geographically speaking, besides what is being spread, a diffusion process involves a place of origin (a source), one or more receiving places, the pathways of spread, and a force driving the diffusion.1.The potential for spatial diffusion depends on the character of the causative agents, such as their transmission modes, mobility, reach, and viability, as well as various determinants. Exposure (i.e., the contact between causes and susceptible individuals) is crucial for transmission and the start of a pathological change in a human or other living being.Contagious diseases (e.g., influenza or STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)) may be transmitted either directly to a susceptible person through intimate contacts with infected humans and animals or indirectly by a vector (e.g., ticks \u2013 tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease; mosquitoes \u2013 malaria). The pathogen may also enter a human body through the air as droplets, with blood, food, and water as well as by surface contacts with objects. The viability of pathogenic agents and their vectors is a crucial factor with infectious diseases. Unless they find a suitable host soon enough they will perish, no transmission will take place, and the diffusion will stop.Noncontagious diseases may be caused or triggered by some physical, chemical, or even social exposure. Some diseases may be the outcome of genetic predispositions, either inevitably caused by genes or triggered by external circumstances. The reach of noninfectious pathogens (such as radioactivity or pollutants) is closely related to the medium which carries them, for example, winds and waters.2.Like other geographical objects, sources of disease diffusion may assume point, line, area, or diffuse shapes. Point sources may be infected wells or polluting anthropogenic plants, such as incinerators. Line-shaped potential sources could be polluted rivers, heavily trafficked roads, or high-voltage cables. Area sources of disease diffusion may be endemic regions and natural reservoirs or places with high radon content in bedrock or buildings. Finally, diffuse sources could be certain behaviors, habits, and practices.3.Next, no infectious diffusion can become apparent (in terms of cases) unless the pathogenic influence reaches a place with a population including susceptible or vulnerable individuals.4.The courses of diffusion are guided and shaped by available routes and nodes as well as barriers. Throughout history, contagious diseases have followed people and animals along rivers, roads, railroads, and caravan trails. Eventually railways, steamships, trucks, buses and, not least, airlines have altered the modes, velocity, and routes of disease diffusion. Winds and water also play a role for the transportation of organisms and vectors. Thus, foot-and-mouth disease has probably been spread by winds from farm to farm without any direct contact between infected and susceptible animals. Cholera diffusion may have been influenced by wind directions.Diffusion of contagious diseases may also follow social routes without obvious physical manifestations. Such diffusion has been mapped, for example, HIV in personal networks.Noninfectious pathogens, such as radiation, chemical emissions, and toxic compounds from volcanic eruptions may be carried by winds and waters.Nodes of diffusion are places where people frequently meet. Typical nodes for the transmission of contagious diseases are urban centers, ports, refugee camps, marketplaces, trading towns, and border towns. Due to poor sanitary and crowded conditions refugee camps are high-risk areas for infections. Thus, in African refugee camps diseases like AIDS and other STDs, cholera, dysentery, plague, diphtheria, Ebola and Lassa fever have been reported. Other nodes are large workplaces, shelters for homeless, schools, and prisons. Likewise, not only permanent localities, but certain occasions such as local festivities and similar social events may increase transmission risks. For example, haymaking in the summer has probably been an occasion for spreading measles in Iceland, contributing to characteristic seasonal waves.On the contrary, disease diffusion may be stopped or deflected by permanent or temporary barriers. Physical barriers, such as vast spaces of water, mountain chains, or large ice sheets, can be effective against \u2018contact\u2019 diffusion (to nearby places). Diffusion may be stopped or slowed down by biological barriers such as widespread immunity and habitats unsuitable for agents or vectors. Further, social barriers involve cultural practices, habits, and knowledge. Thus, disease diffusion may be precluded by public health interventions and precautions, such as quarantine procedures, disinfection, disinsection, and vaccination campaigns, or by widespread knowledge about personal protection.5.Finally, diffusion depends on micro-scale events that bring individuals in contact with health hazards. Humans, animals, transport networks, vehicles, and various objects may be involved in the process. Occupational conditions, daily personal routines and attitudes may be decisive for exposure. Sexual and other cultural practices play an important role for either spreading or barring the spread of STDs \u2013 for example, promiscuity versus fidelity, polygamy, circumcision and other rites.Key groups for infectious transmission are highly mobile people like migrants (such as migrant laborers), refugee populations, truck drivers, and commercial sex workers and their clients. In situations of armed conflicts, troops often appear as another key group.\nIn reality, it is not unusual to see different epidemic waves of a certain disease behaving differently or to find both \u2018contagious\u2019 and hierarchical phases simultaneously or sequentially as parts of a larger diffusion process. Also, new geographical conditions affect the diffusion routes. For example, cholera epidemics swept across the United States and Russia several times in the nineteenth century and it has been ascertained that in the later part of the century both diffusion routes and velocity were affected by the growing railway networks. Instead of advancing slowly to the most nearby places the disease would leap from place to place along the lines (Figure 2\n).",

Then large numbers of opponents went into exile in neighboring countries where HIV was more prevalent, thus becoming exposed and later bringing the disease to South Africa when they returned after the change of regimes.",

GIS has also proved efficient for tracing the sources of infection in a micro-scale context, such as salmonella diffusion in a hospital area (Figure 4\n). Remote sensing can be used for surveillance of ecological conditions and habitats for disease agents and vectors. GIS-supported simulation has been used to forecast the diffusion of HIV/AIDS and TB as well as the spread and health outcome of air pollution and radioactivity. With sufficiently accurate data, simulation can be applied on any level down to blocks and workplaces.",

            "text": "Figure 5: Transmission \u2013 exposure \u2013 diffusion: time geographic outlines. Transmission and diffusion happens on any scale from the individual (micro) to the global and often in complex chains. The figures are based on time-geographical visualization principles. The vertical lines in the figures represent life-paths (trajectories) of individuals. (a) In the most obvious kind of disease diffusion, pathogens are transmitted from one individual to another susceptible individual. One contact may be enough. (b) Sometimes, only one infected person is sufficient to introduce a communicable disease to another area with a virgin population and to start an epidemic. In fact, highly mobile individuals carrying a communicable disease may be in a position to spread the pathogen widely to one person after another and even one place after another. Healthy individuals are represented by full-drawn lines while persons carrying diseases are represented by dashed lines. (c) Short-term relocation and occasional exposure, say during a holiday, when susceptible individuals expose themselves to risks, like excessive sunlight, unfamiliar food, unfamiliar microorganisms, temporary sexual contacts, etc. (d) Diffusion by relocation of vector or artifact. Another type of transmission and diffusion occurs when pathogens are relocated from place to place, between spatially separate populations, without any direct human involvement but with a vector, for example, malaria transmitted by a mosquito. In a similar way, hepatitis and HIV can be transmitted if a syringe is first used by a carrier and then by a noninfected person. (e) The population in a certain place may be exposed to a sudden and temporary insult, such as radioactive fallout after a nuclear accident (thick black horizontal line). The cohorts living in the place at the time will probably carry the effects of the incident during the following years (dashed area). Children born in the place might be affected by lingering effects or genetic damages (shaded area). Out-migrants will bring \u2013 relocate \u2013 their health effects, while in-migrants from other places will be unaffected. Similarly, external factors may exert an insult on a whole population for any length of time or just a certain group, for example, schoolchildren or infants. Likewise the population or certain groups can be affected by health-promotion intervention. (f) Diffusion by relocation of predisposed individuals. Further, people may carry conditional \u2018predispositions\u2019 for diseases when they move. Predispositions are not communicable but congenital \u2013 genetically inherited or individually inborn. This situation in turn opens two alternatives. The predisposed individual will develop the disease either in any case or only under a certain environmental influence. In diffusion terms, a relocation of the disease takes place (cf. Figure 5d). The diffusion may proceed further as a genetically inherited disorder eventually becomes predominant in an isolated population. Generally, large groups of migrants are needed for major changes of the gene frequency in a population but one migrant can be sufficient to spread a dominant, potentially pathogenic gene to another area and another population. (g) Pathogenic diffusion by innovation spread. Finally, just like innovations of any kind are diffused, lifestyle stimuli may reach a place and a population from outside. Subsequent health effects may produce the impression of disease diffusion \u2013 or the reverse, that is, the disappearance of ailments. In fact, the epidemiological transition has largely been due to such changes.",
