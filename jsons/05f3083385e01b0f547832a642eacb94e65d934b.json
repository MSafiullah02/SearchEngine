Patients develop acute hypoxemic respiratory failure following inflammatory injury to the alveolar epithelium and endothelium [1] . The precipitating injury can be direct (e.g., pneumonia, aspiration) or indirect (e.g., peritonitis, pancreatitis, shock). Our understanding of ARDS pathogenesis has increased in the 50 years since this syndrome was first described; however, there are many aspects which continue to elude us [1] . Following the same insult, why do some patients develop ARDS and others do not? How can we predict which critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing ARDS? Advances in ventilation strategies [2] and fluid management have helped to reduce mortality; however, this still remains unacceptably high at 35-45% [3] .",

Surface markers on extracellular vesicles can indicate the parent cell from which they were derived, and also determine which cells can incorporate specific extracellular vesicles. We are now beginning to appreciate the role extracellular vesicles play in intercellular communication in health and disease states, facilitating transfer of genetic material, proteins, and organelles between cell types. Distinctions between the two main subtypes of extracellular vesicles are based on size and origin: exosomes are smaller (<150 nm diameter) and may have an endosomal origin. Microvesicles are larger (up to 1 \u03bcm diameter) and derived from the cell membrane.",

            "text": "Preclinical models of ARDS have shown that extracellular vesicles released following lung injury can mediate inflammation and have an injurious effect. Endothelial injury is often the earliest pathological event leading to the development of ARDS [4] . Circulating endothelial and leukocyte-derived extracellular vesicles are elevated in the intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) rat model of lung injury [5] . Human endothelial cells also release extracellular vesicles following stimulation with plasminogen-activated inhibitor-1 [6] . Several studies have reported that intravenous administration of endothelial extracellular vesicles in rodents induced lung injury with alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, pulmonary edema, elevated inflammatory cytokines (myeloperoxidase [MPO] , interleukin [IL]-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1), and increased lung endothelial permeability [6] [7] [8] . These changes were similar to those observed following intratracheal LPS injury. Endothelial extracellular vesicle treatment of murine or human arterioles impaired nitric oxide release and vasodilation, which partly explains the in vivo findings [6] . Endothelial extracellular vesicles administered concurrently with LPS (intratracheal or intravenous) caused a greater increase in alveolar endothelial permeability and inflammatory cytokine release than either LPS or extracellular vesicles alone [6, 7] . However, when endothelial extracellular vesicles were administered 6 h prior to intravenous LPS, the resulting circulating and alveolar inflammatory cytokine release was significantly greater than with concurrent administration of extracellular vesicles and LPS. An initial endothelial injury triggered release of endothelial extracellular vesicles, which then primed the lung for a greater inflammatory response when exposed to a subsequent infectious insult. Following LPS treatment, human endothelial cells release extracellular vesicles containing nitrated sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-3 (S1PR3) [9] . Elevated circulating S1PR3 concentrations are associated with mortality in critically ill sepsis patients, with or without ARDS. Endothelial extracellular vesicles could therefore represent a potential biomarker and/or offer a novel therapeutic target for ARDS. Simvastatin treatment given concurrently with intravenous LPS in mice reduced endothelial extracellular vesicle release and lung endothelial permeability [10] . This is a particularly interesting finding, since a secondary analysis of an ARDS trial showed that simvastatin reduced mortality in patients with a hyperinflammatory endotype, suggesting that statin therapy was working in part by inhibiting extracellular vesicle release and lung injury [11] . Therefore, therapies aimed at reducing or blocking endothelial extracellular vesicles may attenuate lung injury.",

            "text": "Recently, the results of studies in the ex vivo perfused human lung model have provided compelling new evidence for the potential role of extracellular vesicles in mediating lung injury in ARDS. In an ex vivo perfused human lung model of Gram negative pneumonia, injury with intrabronchial Escherichia coli led to release of extracellular vesicles by lung tissue into the perfusate [12] ; these extracellular vesicles were predominantly endothelial-and platelet-derived. Administration of E. coli-induced extracellular vesicles either into the perfusate or into the air spaces in na\u00efve, uninjured human lungs induced injury similar to the degree of lung injury with E. coli pneumonia: pulmonary edema, impaired alveolar fluid clearance, neutrophilic infiltration, and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) TNF-\u03b1. E. coli-induced extracellular vesicles contained high levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA, which explained at least part of their pro-inflammatory effects. Monocyte uptake of E. coli-induced extracellular vesicles resulted in increased secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. High molecular weight hyaluronic acid bound CD44 on the surface of E. coli-induced extracellular vesicles, thus preventing their uptake by monocytes. Intravenous administration of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid to ex vivo human lungs injured with E. coli or E. coli-induced extracellular vesicles attenuated lung injury, pulmonary edema, BALF TNF-\u03b1 levels, and histologic evidence of lung injury. This important study showed that following infectious injury, human lung tissue releases pathogenic extracellular vesicles, which can mediate more severe inflammatory lung injury. The results suggest that strategies to sequester extracellular vesicles could prevent their uptake and biologic cargo delivery to target cells, thereby reducing subsequent inflammatory injury; extracellular vesicle sequestration may therefore offer a therapeutic strategy in ARDS.",

Alveolar macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles are rapidly released first, followed by endothelial extracellular vesicles and then neutrophil extracellular vesicles. This temporal difference in BALF extracellular vesicles release by different alveolar cell types may give insight into the pathological mechanisms underpinning ARDS. Alveolar macrophage-derived extracellular vesicle release may subsequently trigger pro-inflammatory extracellular vesicle release by epithelial cells and neutrophils. The alveolar macrophage extracellular vesicles can deliver high concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 cargo to alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in increased production of the neutrophil chemotactic factor keratinocytederived cytokine (KC) and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). BALF extracellular vesicles generated from intratracheal LPS treated mice resulted in lung injury when they were administered intratracheally to na\u00efve mice, with increased alveolar neutrophil infiltration, alveolar protein permeability, and elevated BALF KC levels. Administration of these pathogenic BALF extracellular vesicles caused lung injury similar to LPS treatment.

Other investigators found that BALF extracellular vesicles contained high concentrations of miR-466 in intratracheal-LPS mice [19] .

Heterogeneity in cellular function and transcriptome has been shown to impact on patient outcomes in sepsis-related ARDS [20] . It is therefore likely that heterogeneity in extracellular vesicle profiles will similarly impact on patient outcome. Some clinical studies have reported that total leukocyte extracellular vesicle numbers are associated with a better prognosis in ARDS patients. An observational study characterized BALF and circulating extracellular vesicles from 52 ventilated patients with ARDS; control groups included ventilated patients without ARDS, and non-ventilated patients undergoing outpatient bronchoscopy [21] . The majority (90%) of ARDS patients had direct lung injury; 73% had pneumonia. The BALF from ARDS patients contained elevated leukocyte-and neutrophil-derived extracellular vesicles compared to controls. In early ARDS, elevated BALF and plasma concentrations of leukocyte extracellular vesicles were associated with increased survival and ventilator-free days, thus suggesting a potential role for BALF and serum leukocyte extracellular vesicles as prognostic biomarkers in early ARDS. In a separate study, total plasma extracellular vesicle concentrations were measured in 280 critically ill patients on intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 90 of these patients subsequently developed ARDS [22] . Elevated plasma extracellular vesicle concentrations were associated with a lower risk of developing ARDS; this association was seen most strongly in patients admitted to ICU with sepsis. Another group of investigators [23] found that a subset of circulating leukocyte extracellular vesicles expressing \u03b12-macroglobulin (A2MG) were associated with survival in ICU patients with sepsis secondary to pneumonia, but not in patients with sepsis secondary to fecal peritonitis. A2MG-EV treatment in vitro reduced endothelial cell permeability and increased bacterial phagocytosis by neutrophils.",

Binding of neutrophil extracellular vesicles to Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) receptors on macrophages increased secretion of the pro-repair factor TGF\u03b2 and decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 [24, 25] . Therefore, neutrophil extracellular vesicles have an anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages. Neutrophil extracellular vesicles containing miR-223 were found to have an anti-inflammatory effect on alveolar epithelial cells, via suppression of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1 [26] . In murine staphylococcal or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), intratracheal delivery of extracellular vesicles containing miR-223 reduces inflammatory cytokine release, alveolar protein permeability, and lung injury. Infiltration of neutrophils into the alveolar space is a hallmark of ARDS pathogenesis, and their pro-inflammatory role is established [27] . However, this evidence suggests that neutrophils may also have a concurrent anti-inflammatory role, via release of extracellular vesicles that modulate alveolar macrophage and alveolar epithelial cell functions.",

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can attenuate inflammation and lung injury in preclinical models of ARDS, due to their intrinsic anti-inflammatory abilities [30] . Mesenchymal stromal cells mediate their effects via cell-cell contact and via release of paracrine factors; administration of mesenchymal stromal cell conditioned media was previously shown to attenuate lung injury in intratracheal-LPS injured mice [31] . Mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles isolated from conditioned media attenuated inflammation and lung injury in both intratracheal-LPS and E. coli pneumonia models of murine lung injury [32, 33] . Prophylactic treatment with mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles increased survival in rats undergoing traumatic lung injury; inflammatory cytokines, infiltrating leukocytes, and pulmonary edema were all reduced [34] . These effects were in part due to mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicle transfer of miR-124 [34] . In a pig model of influenza-induced lung injury, administration of mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles similarly reduced lung injury, alveolar protein permeability, and inflammatory cytokine release. Mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicle treatment of alveolar epithelial cells reduced viral replication and virus-induced apoptosis. In addition, an experimental model of infant respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborn mice showed a therapeutic effect of extracellular vesicles isolated from mesenchymal stromal cells in reducing lung injury and restoring lung function, in part through induction of antiinflammatory and pro-resolving macrophages [35] . Mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles can transfer mitochondria to alveolar macrophages, inducing a modified M2 (pro-resolving) phenotype [36] . Mesenchymal stromal cells stimulated with IL-1\u03b2 release extracellular vesicles containing miR-146a, which also induces an M2 macrophage phenotype [37] . These mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicle modified alveolar macrophages have pro-resolving characteristics (increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8), but also increased phagocytic activity against bacteria [31, 36, 38, 39] .

Therapeutic strategies to upregulate MerTK expression on alveolar macrophages may aid uptake of pathogenic extracellular vesicles and attenuate inflammation in ARDS. Strategies to inhibit pathogenic extracellular vesicle release also require consideration: alveolar epithelial cells can release IL-25 to inhibit the release of pathogenic alveolar macrophage extracellular vesicles [29] . Simvastatin can inhibit the release of pathogenic endothelial extracellular vesicles in murine models of lung injury [10] and this may be relevant in the setting of ARDS [11] . Surprisingly, neutrophil extracellular vesicles have been shown to have an anti-inflammatory role in sepsis and ARDS [25, 26] . Therefore, strategies to stimulate extracellular vesicle release by neutrophils in vivo or administration of neutrophil extracellular vesicles generated ex vivo could be considered. Extracellular vesicles derived from exogenous mesenchymal stromal cells and endothelial progenitor cells mediate the anti-inflammatory actions of the parent cell by delivery of mitochondria, genetic material, and proteins to injured alveolar cells. As described above, therapeutic use of mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles has shown efficacy at reducing lung injury in several preclinical models. In mouse models of lung injury, mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles have similar efficacy to mesenchymal stromal cells themselves. Finally, exogenous extracellular vesicles could be modified to package custom drugs or protective RNA cargo, which could be delivered to specific cell types as determined by the extracellular vesicle surface markers [47] .",

Future studies will need to characterize BALF and circulating extracellular vesicles from ARDS patients with regard to the cell of origin, cargo assessment (RNA, protein, organelle content), and their biological effect on human cells and human tissues. Standardized methods of biologic fluid collections and RNA isolation from extracellular vesicles are now possible, so that the data will be comparable and generalizable [48] . Extracellular vesicle profiles from ARDS patients will need to be compared with those from animal models and ex vivo human lung models in order to determine how well the extracellular vesicles released in these models correlate with those observed in the clinical setting of ARDS. Clinical studies to test the utility of extracellular vesicles as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in ARDS patients will be needed. Clinical trials of mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles are needed to determine therapeutic utility in patients with ARDS as well as infant respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.",
