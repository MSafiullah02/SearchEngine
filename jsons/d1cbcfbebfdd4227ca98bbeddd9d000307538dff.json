The interest in a systematic investigation of such inductive limits in both the continuous and the holomorphic case derives from several applications, but also from an effort to understand the (intricate) structure of the corresponding spaces; it dates back (at least) to the joint articles [9] and [lo] of the first-named author with R. MEISE and with R. MEISE, W. H. SUMMERS, respectively. A new, important approach to the study of weighted inductive limits was developed in [lo]; viz., the method of \"projective descriptions\": It is a well-known fact that, in general, an inductive limit topology is not directly accessible from its definition and that, in particular, there is no \"good\", useful and sufficiently explicit \"formula\" for its continuous seminorms which would allow direct computations and estimates as they are required in the applications. For weighted inductive limits where the \"steps\" are defined by use of weighted sup-norms, however, projective descriptions do indeed provide natural bases of weighted sup-seminorms for the inductive limit topologies (by associating with the original inductive weight systems V new, projective ones,",

In the important paper [23], VOGT characterized the regularity, completeness and (weak) acyclicity of Kothe (LF)-sequence spaces EP, 1 ,< p < rx) or p = 0. (The only remaining case; viz., the characterization of the weakly acyclic spaces of type Em, was then settled by the authors in [8] .) VOGT already mentioned in [23] that part of his results could be extended to spaces of continuous functions. Here we include such extensions and, to some extent, use VOGT'S methods, results (in particular, Lemma 2.3 is taken from his work) and, above all, his conditions (wQ) and (Q). On the other hand, we do have a different point of view: We concentrate on projective descriptions and exploit the associated system V of weights and the projective hulls C v ( X ) and CVo(X) as far as possible. ~ In Section 2, we quote the unpublished lecture notes 1201 of VOGT at several places. Such references are always complemented by others to the published work of VOGT, but we have preferred to keep the references to [20] since these notes contain full proofs.",

In Section 2 the al-gebraic identity Y C ( X ) = C V ( X ) is characterized in terms of VOGT'S condition (wQ) for the sequence Y (Proposition 2.4). We show that (wQ) is also equivalent to both the regularity and the completeness of Y C ( X ) (Theorem 2.7). In Section 3 we turn to the corresponding algebraic equality Y o C ( X ) = C E ( X ) (or, equivalently, to the completeness of YoC(X)). It holds if and only if Y satisfies VOGT'S condition (Q), and there are several other equivalences (Theorem 3.3). A formulation of (Q) which resembles the regularly decreasing condition of [lo] is included (Lemma 3.2), and we also describe when Y,C(X) and Y C ( X ) satisfy the conditions (M) resp. (M,) of RETAKH (Theorems 3.3, 3.4, 3.6) . The topological identity Y C ( X ) = C v ( X ) is discussed in Section 4. If X is o-compact or discrete and Y satisfies (wQ), we characterize this identity in the spirit of [l], [5] and [22] (Theorem 4.7). The first part of Section 5 is devoted to a natural condition (2) which arises in some applications. Finally, examples of sequences V' for which (wQ) or (Q) hold resp. do no hold are given.",
