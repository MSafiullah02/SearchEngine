On 30. January 2020, the WHO Emergency Committee declared a global health emergency based on growing case notification rates at Chinese and international locations. The case detection rate is changing daily and can be tracked in almost real time on the website provided by Johns Hopkins University 1 and other forums. As of midst of February 2020, China bears the large burden of morbidity and mortality, whereas the incidence in other Asian countries, in Europe and North America remains low so far.",

Coronaviruses were first described in 1966 by Tyrell and Bynoe, who cultivated the viruses from patients with common colds 2. Based on their morphology as spherical virions with a core shell and surface projections resembling a solar corona, they were termed coronaviruses (Latin: corona = crown). Four subfamilies, namely alpha\u2010, beta\u2010, gamma\u2010 and delta\u2010coronaviruses exist. While alpha\u2010 and beta\u2010coronaviruses apparently originate from mammals, in particular from bats, gamma\u2010 and delta\u2010viruses originate from pigs and birds. The genome size varies between 26 kb and 32 kb. Among the seven subtypes of coronaviruses that can infect humans, the beta\u2010coronaviruses may cause severe disease and fatalities, whereas alpha\u2010coronaviruses cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to the B lineage of the beta\u2010coronaviruses and is closely related to the SARS\u2010CoV virus 3, 4. The major four structural genes encode the nucleocapsid protein (N), the spike protein (S), a small membrane protein (SM) and the membrane glycoprotein (M) with an additional membrane glycoprotein (HE) occurring in the HCoV\u2010OC43 and HKU1 beta\u2010coronaviruses 5. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is 96% identical at the whole\u2010genome level to a bat coronavirus 4.",

More recent reports also describe gastrointestinal symptoms and asymptomatic infections, especially among young children 6. Observations so far suggest a mean incubation period of five days 7 and a median incubation period of 3 days (range: 0\u201324 days) 8. The proportion of individuals infected by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of infection has not yet been definitely assessed. In symptomatic patients, the clinical manifestations of the disease usually start after less than a week, consisting of fever, cough, nasal congestion, fatigue and other signs of upper respiratory tract infections. The infection can progress to severe disease with dyspnoea and severe chest symptoms corresponding to pneumonia in approximately 75% of patients, as seen by computed tomography on admission 8. Pneumonia mostly occurs in the second or third week of a symptomatic infection. Prominent signs of viral pneumonia include decreased oxygen saturation, blood gas deviations, changes visible through chest X\u2010rays and other imaging techniques, with ground glass abnormalities, patchy consolidation, alveolar exudates and interlobular involvement, eventually indicating deterioration. Lymphopenia appears to be common, and inflammatory markers (C\u2010reactive protein and proinflammatory cytokines) are elevated.",

Artificial intelligence predicts that drugs associated with AP2\u2010associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) disrupting these proteins may inhibit viral entry into the target cells 13. Baricitinib, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is an AAK1 and Janus kinase inhibitor and suggested for controlling viral replication 13. Moreover, one in vitro and a clinical study indicate that remdesivir, an adenosine analogue that acts as a viral protein inhibitor, has improved the condition in one patient 14, 15. Chloroquine, by increasing the endosomal pH required for virus\u2010cell fusion, has the potential of blocking viral infection 15 and was shown to affect activation of p38 mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK), which is involved in replication of HCoV\u2010229E 16. A combination of the antiretroviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir significantly improved the clinical condition of SARS\u2010CoV patients 17 and might be an option in COVID\u201019 infections. Further possibilities include leronlimab, a humanised monoclonal antibody (CCR5 antagonist), and galidesivir, a nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitor, both of which have shown survival benefits in several deadly virus infections and are being considered as potential treatment candidates 18. Repurposing these available drugs for immediate use in treatment in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections could improve the currently available clinical management. Clinical trials presently registered at ClinicalTrials.gov focus on the efficacy of remdesivir, immunoglobulins, arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomisation, ASC09F+Oseltamivir, ritonavir plus oseltamivir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, mesenchymal stem cell treatment, darunavir plus cobicistat, hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone and washed microbiota transplantation 19.",
