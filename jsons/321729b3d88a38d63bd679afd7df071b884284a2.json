In the UK Covid-19 epidemic, infections cannot be counted, but their influence is seen in the curve of the mortality data. This work simulated social distancing and the lockdown in the UK Covid-19 epidemic to explore strategies for relaxation.",

The twin did not influence the curve of current infections or the behaviour of the epidemic. In this way the variance in the critically ill contagious period was allowed to influence the exponential phase in a larger virtual mortality data set.

The periods are those shown in Figure 4 . Normally the critically ill distribution applies to only 5% of individuals. As anticipated, in [A] the curve for infections is relatively insensitive to the 5% proportion having a longer contagious period whilst the mortality curve is shifted by about 1 week. In [B] all infected individuals had a contagious period from the critically ill distribution and the curve for infections was then markedly altered. It is the change in the curve of infections which leads to the mortality curve in the right-hand panel being larger and displaced to the right.

In the final illustration, the pre-mitigation parameters { 18 , 10 , 90 } were used to generate an epidemic without mitigations, in search of the 260,000 deaths modelled by Imperial College (1). The epidemic was impressive, see Figure 13 . The two month-long epidemic shown in Figure 13 , which experienced no mitigating interventions, would have accounted for around 65,000 deaths in this analysis, somewhat short of the 260,000, but nonetheless a challenge in its magnitude and brevity. The unmitigated epidemic is shown in contrast to the achievements of social distancing and the lockdown which 'flattened the curve'.",
