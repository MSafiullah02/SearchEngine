It is proposed that the incorporation of software agents into the crisis communication portal will be capable to send alert news to subscribed users via internet and mobile services. The proposed system consists of crawler, wrapper, name-entity tagger, AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup language) and an animated character is used in the front-end for human computer communication.",

Within the context of this paper, crisis may be referred to events or incidents that have the potential to cause national panic, confusion, unrest and possible catastrophe. These crises may be due to health epidemic, natural disasters and man-made tragedies such as terrorist attacks. Examples of these events that happened in the recent past are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), bird flu, mad cow disease, September 11, earth quakes and tsunami. In these cases, accurate information delivered within the shortest duration of time at the lowest costs would be essential in informing the affected communities and the relevant authorities. In particular, if decisions are made quickly and appropriately, this will have the benefits of reducing the potential damages and will lead to better manage of the situations. This paper reports the development an Automated Knowledge Extraction Agent (AKEA) which was designed to establish the knowledge base for a global crisis communication system called CCNet. CCNet was proposed during the height of the SARS epidemic in 2003. It was aimed at providing up-to-date information to its users via a conversational software robot called AINI (Artificial Intelligence Neuralnetwork Identity). The purpose of AINI is to deliver essential information from trusted sources and is able to interact with its users by animated characters. The idea is to rely on a human-like communication approach thereby providing a sense of comfort and familiarity. The functionalities of AINI have been reported in the past and development on AINI is ongoing [1] . It is foreseeable that the combination of AINI and AKEA will produce a more natural means of communication and computing in the near future. ",

Information in the news repository is directly published to the CCNet portal without any further processing. The AIML converter uses the template bank to transform the news repository entries into AIML representation, which will be populated into AINI's knowledge base. The richer the template bank, the wider the scope of questions AINI will be able to handle. Substitutions will be made to the template using relevant values of each entry in the news repository. There are four fields in the template namely the wh-token corresponding to the ontology tag, first two lines of content, disease named entity and URL. The first and second require some processing prior to replacement. The ontology tag associated with each named entity is resolved to obtain the corresponding wh-token. Currently, the agent is capable of handling four types of wh-token: where, resolved from location named-entities; when, resolved from date named-entities; who, resolved from agent named-entities and what. The what token is resolvable from all ontological entities with additional tokens. For example, given the named entity Burkina Faso and its tag country, we can obtain the where token and what token with the country tag. This is possible because the question where does meningitis\u2026? is similar to asking what country does meningitis\u2026?",

The remaining news will be presented as part of a URL push. The AIML converter follows precedence in converting named-entities and their ontology tag into AIML representation. All questions handled by AINI are based on the concept of disease and thus, all news content will surely contain disease named-entities. During conversion, priority will be given to entities other than disease. Only when a news item that does not contain any other entities (i.e. there are no information about location, person or date) is encountered, then the converter will resolve the sole disease named-entity to the what token. Finally, these instances will be populated into AINI's knowledge base for learning and used by the AINI's chat interface in the CCNet portal for natural language question answering.",

            "text": "This section explains how AINI knowledge works. Firstly, AINI will search for an answer from Level 1 specific domain (Crisis Communication knowledge base) created by AKEA. If an answer is not found, it will move to Level 2 from the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) knowledge base which are stored in the FAQ table on MySQL database. Questions such as what is SARS, how SARS spread, what is SARS vaccination, where SARS happen, etc can be answered at this level. The next level is Level 3, which is metadata (News database). The search is done by identifying the keyword in the question and matching it with the content of the metadata. Since the WWW is so big that simple pattern matching techniques can often replace the need to understand both the structure and meaning of language. If an answer is still not found, AINI will proceed to Level 4 where AIML common knowledge will take place. If AINI still cannot answer the question, the last step will store the unanswered question in the database for the attention of the administrator. The answers will then be subsequently stored in the Level 2. This will enable AINI to answer the same question in the future.",

This research will continue to develop and make use of the Internet to create global virtual communities by using intelligent agents and software robot. This intelligent software robot will assist the communication process by giving necessary and vital information needed by users during a crisis. It will also help in maintaining calmness and order so that the country and the communities will not be hijacked by fear and panic. It is proposed that users will have more trust in the information provided by the intelligent software robot because of its interactive features and an ongoing engagement with the users. Furthermore, the integrated Text-To-Speech Technology and 3D human-like character or avatar in the system is capable to deliver speech and interact with the user in a humanlike manner thereby generating a sense of care and comfort. The portal also provides news, advertisements, conversation logs and statistics in the system benefiting the researchers in their efforts to further enhance the system. In the anticipated forthcoming epidemics or waves of new diseases due to mutation of bacteria and viruses, the output from this research will be useful to tackle future health crises. Information on natural disasters such as tsunamis, typhoons, earthquakes and floods will also be effectively managed and disseminated by deploying CCNet System. It is believed that CCNet provides a well-engineered platform for experimentation with various Web-enabled question answering techniques by employing conversation software robot. The implementation is currently under ongoing development. Progress and preliminary results will be reported. In the future, we will endeavour to continually refine the existing technology and to develop new frameworks in order to enable an efficient Internet-based global crisis communication.",
