The pandemic led to nationally-recognized surgical care guidelines from the American College of Surgeons (ACS), the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS),4, 5, 6 which implemented a tiered framework of recommendations to appropriately triage and plan for a surge of COVID-19 cases. Hospitals began prioritizing services and care to those with emergent cases and acute pain to optimize the use of essential medical supplies and equipment. As a result, normal clinic and operating duties for many orthopaedic surgeons were severely diminished.",

Our hypothesis was that the initiation of the OWICs would decrease the number of orthopaedic non-emergency referrals from the ED, and free personnel and equipment to combat the COVID-19 surge. The preliminary success of the OWICs was determined by comparing the number of non-emergency orthopaedic referrals generated by the ED both before and after the implementation of the OWICs.

Prior to March 23, 2020, patients who presented to the ED with orthopaedic complaints either had emergency inpatient consultation performed by the on-call orthopaedic surgeon or were treated by the ED staff and discharged home with an outpatient non-emergency orthopaedic referral.

Exclusion criteria included patients both with injuries that were too severe for our clinic as well as those that were chronic. Patients with severe injuries sent directly to the ED included polytrauma, open fractures (except for Gustilo-Anderson Grade I open fractures of the upper extremity), and patients transported by Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Patients who were suffering from chronic complaints of greater than one month were also excluded from the OWICs, and instead were consulted via telemedicine at a later date. The orthopaedic surgeon overseeing the clinic made the final decision on whether a patient was acceptable to be seen in the OWIC or needed to be sent to the ED.

The study included 6 weeks of data from the OWICs, and 11 weeks of historical data from the ED, limiting the current work to a preliminary evaluation. However, given the timing and acute nature of this evolving situation, these preliminary data were useful for addressing current hospital response strategies and providing the basis for a long-term and larger study. Second, the OWICs were set up in semi-rural parts of Maine. Given Maine's relatively low number of cases of coronavirus, this model may not be generalizable to hospitals in larger cities that have been more affected by COVID-19. However, the threat of overburdened healthcare systems and lack of medical resources are universal, and the OWICs demonstrated how EDs can allocate the supply of PPE and other scarce medical equipment for COVID-19 cases. Third, although the orthopaedic clinics developed at our hospital could potentially serve as models for other hospitals across specialties and regions, they are not the only systems to set up specialized emergency clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic; temporary surge clinics have been built across communities in response to the crisis.8\n,\n13 Fourth, these clinics are associated with the need for additional resources that might not be available to other facilities.",
