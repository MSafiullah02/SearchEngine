One of the most difficult clinical distinctions is whether the patient has primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (SS) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with secondary SS. It is easiest to think of SLE to be composed of a series of clinical subsets that are characterized by their characteristic autoantibodies and associated HLA-DR associations. SS has close similarity to one of the subsets in SLE. Similarly, many older patients who are labeled \u201cSLE\u201d based on arthralgia, rashes, and a positive ANA probably have SS rather than SLE",

Although the previous figure emphasizes the \u201coverlap of symptoms\u201d between SLE and SS, this figure demonstrates that the diagnosis of SS does lead to consideration of a slightly different pattern of extraglandular manifestations. Put most simply, many manifestations of SLE can be considered to develop as a result of antibody\u2013antigen immune complexes and complement activation. In this simplified model, SS is considered a \u201clymphocyte\u201d infiltrative disorder (as manifest by the salivary gland infiltrates on one hand and increased lymphoma at the extreme). This would lead to glomerulonephritis in SLE and interstitial nephritis in SS. Similarly, lung abnormalities would be pleural effusions in SLE and interstitial pneumonitis in SS.
