However, DNA microarray technology possesses some limitations because mRNA profiles do not always correlate with protein expression (Gygi et al., 1999; Kopf and Zharhary, 2007) .

More recently, a so-called reversephase array has been developed, providing an alternative format to analytical microarrays in which tissue/cell lysates (or fractionated lysates) are used to form such an array (Poetz et al., 2005) .

The first model to demonstrate the application of antibody arrays employed the \"analytelabeled\" assay format. In this format, proteins are detected after antibody capture using direct protein labeling (Haab, 2005) . Using this format, Knezevic et al. (2001) successfully found alterations in protein expression in cancer cell development. Multiple differences in protein expression could be detected in epithelial and stromal cells using this array format. However, some of its limitations have to be taken into consideration because this method lacks specificity in protein target labeling and has poor sensitivity for low-abundance proteins. Moreover, targeted protein labeling may lead to epitope destruction because of some chemical reactions (Poetz et al., 2005 ). Another antibody array model provides higher sensitivity using the \"sandwich\" assay format. This format employs two different antibodies to detect the targeted protein (Haab, 2005; Poetz et al., 2005) . One antibody, called the capture antibody, immobilizes the targeted protein on the solid phase, while the other antibody, called the reporter or detection antibody, generates a signal for the detection system. Using two antibodies significantly increases the specificity and sensitivity of the \"sandwich\" assay format, even at femtomolar levels (Poetz et al., 2005; Chen and Zhu, 2006) . Gonzalez et al. (2011) reported the application of the sandwich assay format to distinguish between two similar samples: blood plasma and serum. They were able to perform highspecificity and high-sensitivity detection using less than 1 \u03bcl of sample with this platform.

The need for highly specific antibodies has become a major challenge in the use of analytical protein microarrays (Talapatra et al., 2002; Poetz et al., 2005; Chen and Zhu, 2006) because nonspecific binding will lead to large numbers of false positive results (Talapatra et al., 2002) .

Harnessing this sophisticated technology, Ciaccio et al. (2010) profiled EGF receptor signaling dynamics using micro-western arrays (MWAs), which combine western blotting and reverse-phase protein microarrays to produce better sensitivity by the separation of whole-lysate sample components. This method allowed them to precisely measure 91 phosphosites of 67 proteins at six different time points with five EGF concentrations in A431 human carcinoma cells to analyze the dynamic profile of EGF receptor concentrations. A significant drawback of this approach, however, is that it is highly dependent on the availability and specificity of commercially produced antibodies. Because of this bias, it has limited applications. Commercially available protein microarrays are available in many different formats, which represent the three types of protein microarrays. While some companies provide high-content protein microarrays comprising hundreds of purified proteins or antibodies, most of them provide a specialized array platform for certain research purposes, such as the detection of human cytokines, phosphorylation events, and the study of certain pathogenhost interactions (Table 27 .1.1). For example, Invitrogen provides a human protein microarray of \u223c9000 full-length human proteins purified individually from insect cells. The quantity and quality of this array is carefully controlled. The major advantage of commercial protein microarrays is that they provide commercial access to researchers who are not familiar with this technology. However, the disadvantages are obvious as well.

Phage display was one of the early methods developed to generate recombinant antibodies (Carmen and Jermutus, 2002; Brichta et al., 2005) . Using antibody-fragment encoding genes (VH and VL) and bacteriophage capsid gene fusion, this technology enables sets of human antibody libraries to be stored in prokaryotic systems where they can be readily expressed by phage infection. Prokaryotic expression systems promise large-scale antibody production in short time periods. In addition, this system generates antibody fragments lacking the Fc domain rather than intact IgG antibodies, eliminating nonspecific binding to the Fc receptor (Knappik and Brundiers, 2009 ). The recombinant antibodies are expressed and displayed in the phage capsid, and then purified using column chromatography. Recently, other methods have been developed to generate recombinant antibodies in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g., yeast display) or even in vitro environments (e.g., mRNA display, ribosome display), which provide additional advantages for recombinant antibody fabrication (Irving et al., 2001; Chao et al., 2006; Tabata et al., 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 223, "end": 250, "text": "(Carmen and Jermutus, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 251, "end": 272, "text": "Brichta et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 769, "end": 797, "text": "(Knappik and Brundiers, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1222, "text": "(Irving et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1241, "text": "Chao et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1262, "text": "Tabata et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Protein Production"}, {"text": "The fabrication of functional protein microarrays faces an even bigger challenge because of the need for large amounts of highly purified proteins. Furthermore, to generate functional proteins, biochemical characteristics (such as protein folding and posttranslational modifications) and physical conditions during the purification procedure have to be considered.

Using a batch purification protocol in a 96-well format, >4000 recombinant proteins can be overexpressed and purified in yeast or E. coli Jeong et al., 2012) . Because it is challenging for most laboratories to purify large numbers of proteins, Angenendt et al. (2006) developed an alternative technology in protein chip fabrication, dubbed the nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA; UNIT 27.2). Spotting plasmid DNAs with capture antibodies allows for the generation of a protein microarray via simultaneous in situ transcription/translation reactions and protein immobilization on the printed slides. A significant benefit of this approach is that the printed template DNA microarray can be stored for a long time, and the resulting protein microarrays are always freshly made. This method allows the generation of up to 13,000 protein spots on one slide without laborious cloning and expression vectors. In addition, our group has developed two strategies to fabricate protein microarrays by directly capturing nascent polypeptides on a solid surface during translation using puromycin. Employing synthetic or in vitrotranscribed RNAs for this strategy, we can produce high-density and high-quality protein microarrays (Tao and Zhu, 2006) .

Moreover, these fluorescent dyes provide a multicolor detection system, which allows for multiplex assay design. Harnessing the advantage of signal amplification, enzymatic methods offer a significant improvement in signal detection sensitivity. The most popular enzyme is horseradish peroxidase. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) and tyramide signal amplification (TSA) have also been developed to detect low-abundance proteins (Schweitzer et al., 2002; Varnum et al., 2004) .

To date, these assays have been successfully developed to detect various types of protein-binding properties, such as proteinprotein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA, proteinlipid, protein-drug, and protein-glycan interactions (MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000; Zhu et al., , 2007 Hall et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2004; Ho et al., 2006; Popescu et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2009; Kung et al., 2009) , and identify substrates of various classes of enzymes, such as protein kinases, ubiquitin/SUMO E3 ligases, and acetyltransferases, to name a few (Zhu et al., 2000; Ptacek et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2008; Schnack et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2009) . During the development of various types of assays, it became obvious that surface chemistry plays an important role in the success of a new assay (Table 27 .1.2). For example, protein-DNA interactions were first performed on yeast proteome microarrays on a nitrocellulose surface (i.e., FAST Slide) with randomly shared yeast genomic DNA fragments (\u223c500 bp) that were labeled with Cy5 (Hall et al., 2004) . Later, Hu et al. also found that, among other tested surfaces, the FAST Slide produced the best signal-to-noise ratio for detecting interactions between short DNA motifs (36 to 100 bp) and proteins (Hu et al., 2009) . In another example, when the Zhu group was developing protein acetylation reactions using 14 Clabeled Ac-CoA as a donor, they first tested the HAT activity of the NuA4 acetyltransferase complex using histones H3 and H4 as substrates on FAST Slides, as well as aldehydeand Ni-NTA-coated slides Lu et al., 2011) . The results clearly showed that both FAST and nickel surfaces worked, but the FAST surface produced better signalto-noise ratios. However, the FAST surface was not suitable for phosphorylation reactions because the background noise was too high (Ptacek et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2009 ). Another instance where surface chemistry is vital to assay development is the profiling of cell surface glycans on a lectin microarray. Our group and others have found that the only proper surface for this type of binding assay is a commercial Schott slide, although the exact surface chemistry is proprietary (Hsu et al., 2006; Pilobello et al., 2007; Tao et al., 2008) . Several reasons factor into the importance of surface chemistry. First, for low-affinity binding assays (e.g., protein-DNA interactions), a porous surface (e.g., FAST) is likely to retain more proteins and hence improve sensitivity. Second, when radioisotope-labeled small molecules are used, it is important to completely remove unincorporated radioisotopes from the surface to reduce background noise. Excess retention of radioisotopes might explain why phosphorylation assays do not work well on FAST surfaces.

In phase II, they fabricated an AIH-specific protein chip with the 11 proteins and obtained autoimmunogenic profiles of serum samples from 44 AIH patients, 50 healthy controls, and 184 additional patients suffering from hepatitis B, hepatitis C, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, or", "cite_spans": [{"start": 866, "end": 884, "text": "Song et al.

These studies clearly demonstrate the power of protein microarrays in the identification of potential biomarkers; however, several shortcomings are repeatedly seen in these studies. For instance, many of these arrays were fabricated using proteins expressed in E. coli without purification (Doolan et al., 2008; Luevano et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011; Vigil et al., 2011) . Since these proteins are contaminated with E. coli proteins, the sensitivity of the assay is likely reduced because of the high immunogenicity of the contaminating proteins . As a result, E. coli lysates had to be used as a blocking reagent to alleviate this problem. Also problematic is that in many of these studies, identified biomarkers were not validated with additional cohorts and therefore, the possibility of overfitting (see Biomarker Identification) was not completely ruled out.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 304, "text": "(Doolan et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 305, "end": 326, "text": "Luevano et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 327, "end": 346, "text": "Liang et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 347, "end": 366, "text": "Vigil et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 659, "end": 680, "text": "(Doolan et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 681, "end": 702, "text": "Luevano et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 703, "end": 722, "text": "Liang et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 723, "end": 742, "text": "Vigil et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "27.1.13"}, {"text": "Protein microarrays have become one of the most powerful tools in proteomic studies and can be applied with many different purposes. High-throughput processing has become the trend because of its reduced cost and highproductivity results. Given a high-throughput and parallel system, protein microarrays will accelerate new findings in protein interactions for basic research as well as clinical research purposes. One important factor that demonstrates the superiority of this technology compared with other techniques is the reduction of sample volume usage. This factor is especially important for clinical research that uses precious samples, such as human serum. In addition, the high sensitivity and specificity of protein microarrays provides a powerful tool in quantifying and profiling proteins. Despite many successful applications of protein microarrays, the limitations of this technology still leave many challenges. The large-scale production of high-quality antibodies using recombinant platforms is still difficult due to the complexity of expression and purification procedures.
