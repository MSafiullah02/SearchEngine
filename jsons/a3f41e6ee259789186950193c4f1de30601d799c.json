' Abbreviations used: BSA, bovine serum albumin; BCIP, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt; BSM, bovine subman-sion activities (1, 2) , uses 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac,) as a high-affinity receptor determinant for attachment to cells (3) . The specificity of influenza C virus (INF-C) for Neu5,9Ac, has been studied mostly using either hemagglutination assays or binding of radioactively labeled virus. The virus binds to any Neu5,9Ac, regardless of the (~(2-3) or (2-6) linkage, in Gal/3( l-3/4)GalNAc or Gal/3( l-314)GlcNAc complexes (3) . There is no convincing report, dealing directly with the binding activity, which gives evidence of any other carbohydrate structure involved in the specificity of this activity. A major determinant of the cell tropism of INF-C is the expression of appropriate cell surface receptors (4) . Using chicken erythrocytes, this determinant, which contains Neu5,9Ac,, was shown to be a differentiation marker, whose expression increased after birth (5) .",

As previously described (24, 25) , glycophorins strongly aggregate in aqueous solution. The dissociation of aggregates is not complete in the presence of detergent and this explains why glycophorins exist in the form of dimers. This is the reason why the number of PAS-positive bands does not reflect the number of glycophorins following SDS-PAGE analysis. In addition, some bands are due not only to homo-and heterodimers but also to higher oligomers (26) . As shown in Fig. lA, lane 2 , four bands detected by INF-C can be identified as GPl, GP2, GP3.1, and GP3.2. GP2 and GP3 were demonstrated to be the two murine glycophorins, and GPl was described as the heterodimer of GP2 and GP3 (27) (28) (29) . GP3.1 was described as the mature complete form of the glyco- phorin GP3, and GP3.2 as an incomplete form of it (30) . As shown Fig. lA, lane 2 , staining of GP2, and GPl to a lesser extent, was much stronger than that of GP3. These data are consistent with the previous reports from Sarris and Palade cited above, showing that the majority of the 0-acetylated sialyl residues were carried by GP2 and GPl. As shown in Fig. lA, lane 1 , colloidal gold staining of proteins seemed to be the inverse of \"viro-staining,\" since GP3, which carries a small amount of 0-acetylated sialic acid, was clearly stained by colloidal gold, whereas the major band recognized by INF-C was not stained at all. For molecular weights higher than 67,000 M,, the identification is not possible because of aggregates as discussed above. According to the reports cited above, it could be estimated that the total amount of murine 0-acetylated glycophorins put in a lane for detection with INF-C was less than 1.7 pg for the results shown GP2 and GPl could be detected by this technique when only 0.4 pg of 0-acetylated glycophorins was put in the lane (data not shown). Thus the detection is sensitive.",

Mouse erythrocytes, whose sialic acid is 50-60% O-acetylated, provided receptor-like glycoproteins. Embryo chicken brain provided a receptor-like glycolipid mixture, rich in 0-acetylated gangliosides. As proposed by Muchmore and Varki (38) , who suggested that hemagglutination and receptor-destroying enzyme activities do not share the same binding site of HEF, we used selective inactivation of the viral e&erase activity by DFP to prevent virus detachment.",

The former are known to contain 9-0-acetylated sialic acid. The failure to recognize ovine sialoglycoproteins was consistent with the lack of hemagglutination by INF-C. In order to verify that the specificity of binding of INF-C was preserved on electrophoregrams, it was shown that INF-C bound to some but not all proteins. The major glycoprotein recognized by INF-C in mouse EGP was identified as the more 0-acetylated murine glycophorin (27) . This protein was also detected by MAA, which is specific for sialic acids. Alkali, 0-acetyl e&erase, sialidase treatments, and inhibition experiments supported the expected specificity of INF-C for 0-acetylated sialic acids.",

The applications of such techniques in our laboratories for studying the occurrence of 0-acetylated sialic acids in various cell lines and in some tissues, such as chicken cerebellum, are in progress, since preliminary experiments showed that INF-C might be neurotropic in experimentally infected chicken embryos. The biological importance of acetylation of sialic acids is poorly understood.The occurrence of O-acetylated sialic acids on red blood cells can vary not only with the animal species but also with the age of the animal, as was demonstrated for chicken erythrocytes (5). 0-acetylation of disialoganglioside GD3 by human melanoma cells was shown to provide a potential tumor-specific antigen (39) . INF-C has been used in the past for studying virus receptors: the major receptor for human coronaviruses OC43 and E229 was shown to be O-acetylated sialic acids by comparison with those of INF-C (40) . The acetylation of sialoglycoconjugates should interfere with different processes, such as cell maturation; cell recognition, probably with immunological implications; cell differentiation and dedifferentiation; and virus-cell interactions.The use of both binding and esterase activity could provide a better understanding of the biological roles played by 0-acetylated sialic acids.
