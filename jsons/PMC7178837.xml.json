DNA is responsible for determining the structure of the cell, the function and activity of the cell in response to various stimuli, and the interaction the cell has with other cells and the extracellular environment. The DNA molecule consists of two chains of deoxyribonucleotides held together by complementary base pairs. The deoxyribonucleotides contain the four nucleotide bases, adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) that are covalently bound together by phosphodiesterase bonds linking the 5\u2032 carbon of one deoxyribose group to the 3\u2032 carbon of the next group. The two chains of deoxyribonucleotides are linked by hydrogen bonds between the A\u2019s of one strand and the T\u2019s of the other. Likewise, the G\u2019s of one strand are linked by hydrogen bonds to the C\u2019s of the complementary strand. These two complementary strands form the DNA double helix (Fig. 11-1), with one strand running in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction while the other strand runs in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction. The order of nucleotides bases is termed the sequence and is read in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction.

Overall, humans have 46 chromosomes, including 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of a centromere and two telomeres (ends) (Fig. 11-2). The two arms of the chromosome are the short arm (p) and long arm (q). The parts of the genome that contain nucleotide sequences that code for proteins are the genes and it is estimated that the human genome contains about 20,000\u201330,000 genes. The structure of genes is very complex and highly variable. Genes are made up of a variable number of exons, which contain the actual coding sequence for the proteins, and introns, which are noncoding regions which separate the exons. While the function of the introns is unclear, some disease processes have been found to be associated with certain nucleotide variations located in these intron regions (Fig. 11-3). Genes also have regulatory regions, including promoter sequences that generally reside at the 5\u2032 end of the gene (referred to as upstream) and regions at the 3\u2032 end associated with stability of the mRNA.\n\nGenes are made up of a variable number of exons, which contain the actual coding sequence for the proteins, and introns, which are noncoding regions which separate the exons.\n",

The closer together two loci are on a chromosome, the lower the likelihood of recombination to occur between them. If loci are very close, they are said to be linked. The reliability of genetic linkage between loci is determined using the LOD score, which is an estimate of whether two loci are likely to lie near each other on a chromosome and are therefore likely to be inherited together. A LOD score of 3 or more, which represents odds of 1000:1 or greater in favor of linkage, is used to indicate statistically significant linkage, and therefore concludes that the two loci of interest are close.",

Mutations can be classified as somatic mutations, which occur in somatic cells and are not commonly passed on to offspring, and germ-line mutations which occur in the reproductive cells and are passed on to offspring. There are several different types of mutations. Translocations are large-scale mutations comprised of switching of chromosomal regions between one chromosome and another chromosome. Mutations can also consist of single changes in the nucleotide bases and include substitution, deletion, or insertion of nucleotides. Insertions and deletions can also involve hundreds of nucleotides. Mutations that occur in the coding regions can have several consequences: they can change the amino acid of the protein at a single site, they can cause a premature stop codon resulting in early termination of translation, and, consequently, lead to a truncated protein, or they may have no effect at all if the mutation leads to a nucleotide substitution that does not alter the amino acid. Likewise, mutations in noncoding regulatory regions (such as promoters) may also affect the expression of the gene by altering the quantity of mRNA transcribed and, hence, the level of the protein. Mutations in the intron/exon boundary region may also lead to incorrectly spliced mRNAs and result in significantly different proteins or differences in levels of protein products.\nGenetic mutations are rare changes that occur in the sequence of DNA that occur in less than 1% of the population.\n",

There are estimates that the human genome may contain over 10 million of these types of variations. These differences in the nucleotide sequence are what give rise to our genetic variability; they account for inherited differences in our physical traits and the way we respond to environmental stimuli and medications. While the majority of these nucleotide variations do not cause a disease, some genetic variations may influence the development of certain diseases. The mutations discussed in the preceding paragraph are variations that occur in less than 1% of the population and are, thereby, rare. On the other hand, variations that occur at a frequency greater than 1% in the population are referred to as polymorphisms. If the polymorphism is a change in a single nucleotide, it is referred to as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). These more common genetic variations, whether SNPs or small insertions or deletions of nucleotides, are the ones currently being examined in many studies for associations with susceptibility to and outcome from diseases seen in the intensive care unit setting. Copy number variations (CNVs) are stretches of DNA of greater than 1 kb that show differences in the expected number of copies of the DNA in greater than 1% of the human population. Very recently it has become clear that CNVs are also common in human genomes and contribute significantly to human genetic variation.\nPolymorphisms are variations that occur at a frequency greater than 1% in the population; if the polymorphism is a change in a single nucleotide, it is referred to as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).\n",

Keeping in mind the above discussion of genetic variations, a locus may contain two slightly different sequences for a specific gene. These alternative forms of a gene are termed alleles, or variants. The alleles for a specific individual at a genetic locus is that person\u2019s genotype. An example is the surfactant protein B (SP-B) +1580 site. An individual\u2019s genotype at that site may either be TT, CT, or CC. Individuals are heterozygous if they possess two different alleles at the locus of interest and homozygous if they possess two identical alleles at that locus. But we obviously do not contain only one genetic variation in our genome. A haplotype represents a combination of polymorphic alleles on a single chromosome delineating a pattern that is inherited together and transmitted from parent to offspring. Haplotype analysis is a useful tool for analysis of disease gene discovery, as investigators may capitalize on the fact that many of the polymorphisms of interest are not transmitted independently of each other, and the presence of one gene variant can tag the presence of another polymorphism from the same chromosome. In some cases, haplotype assessment can provide a higher level of specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy in \u201ctrue\u201d associations with disease risk or severity. By focusing on haplotypes as well as SNPs, researchers are now able to more accurately study genetic predisposition to various diseases of interest. With the recent report of the International HapMap Consortium, and the identification and cataloging of haplotypes now available, the utility of this type of study is brought into focus as an important tool to guide genetic association studies on complex human diseases.\nA haplotype represents a combination of polymorphic alleles on a single chromosome delineating a pattern that is inherited together and transmitted from parent to offspring.\n",

This occurs by a combination of two distinct processes: transcription and translation. Transcription is the process by which the genetic information in DNA is transcribed into messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). mRNA differs from DNA in that it is single-stranded, has a modified sugar backbone, and contains uracil (U) instead of T. The process of transcription involves the unwinding of the two complementary strands of DNA, the enzyme RNA polymerase binding to the promoter region of a gene on a single strand of DNA, and synthesizing the mRNA molecule by adding ribonucleotides in an order that is complementary to the DNA strand. The transcribed mRNA thus contains all the genetic information between the transcriptional start and stop sites on the DNA including exons and introns. The non-coding intron sequences are removed by a process referred to as splicing which connects all the exons together to form the final mRNA product. This mRNA represents the coding DNA sequences for a single gene. (It should be noted that splicing variations have been identified that influence disease processes that impact the final protein product by altering the mRNA sequences that are spliced together.) The mRNA is then transported to the cytoplasm, and translation occurs, in which the genetic information from mRNA is utilized to guide the synthesis of proteins. Proteins are composed of amino acids. There are 20 different amino acids in humans, and each is encoded by a set of 3 nucleotides in the mRNA. These three nucleotides are called triplets or codons. The corresponding anticodon on the transfer RNA (tRNA) links with a codon, presenting its unique amino acid in the process of translational protein synthesis.\nGene expression is the process by which the information contained within genes is used to make proteins.\nTranscription is the process by which the genetic information in DNA is transcribed into messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA).\nTranslation is the process by which the genetic information from mRNA is utilized to guide the synthesis of proteins.\n",

This differential expression of genes ensures that cells develop correctly, can differentiate and function as specialized cells, and can mount various responses to external stimuli. In certain disease states, expression of specific genes may change, thereby providing a clue as to which genes may be important in that disease process. Recent advances in technology have provided a valuable tool to evaluate the expression of genes during various diseases, including sepsis. These technologies include DNA microarrays, in which the basic approach is as follows: small strands of DNA probes representing the genes of interest, for example, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), are attached to a solid substrate such as a glass slide or silicon chip (in reality, thousands of probes are applied to the same micorarray chip). mRNA is then isolated from, for example, a patient without acute lung injury (ALI) and one with ALI. These two samples are then separately converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) in a manner which incorporates different fluorophores in the two samples of cDNA (e.g., red into all the cDNAs from the patient with ALI which would also include cDNA made from the mRNA coding for TNF-\u03b1, and green into all the cDNAs from the patient without ALI including the cDNA made from the mRNA coding for TNF-\u03b1). The cDNAs from the two patients are then mixed and hybridized to the chip containing the DNA probes. Thus, if TNF-\u03b1 is up-regulated in ALI and there is significantly more cDNA in the ALI sample than the non-ALI sample, then more red fluorophore \u2013labeled cDNA would be present. When the mixture of cDNAs is hybridized to the chip containing the probes, the probe for TNF-\u03b1 would light up red and represent increased expression of the TNF-\u03b1 gene in ALI. If TNF-\u03b1 is expressed at a lower concentration in the patient with ALI then when the samples are mixed, more green fluorophore-labeled cDNA would be present than red fluorophore-labeled cDNA, and the probe for TNF-\u03b1 on the microarray chip would light up green indicating decreased expression of TNF-\u03b1 gene in ALI. Finally, if there is no change in the expression of the TNF-\u03b1 gene, the amounts of red and green fluorophore-labeled cDNAs would be equal, and the probe for the TNF-\u03b1 gene would light up yellow. In this fashion, one can identify specific genes that are expressed in the development of ALI. Several examples of the use of this technology in the critically ill patient have been published which have aided our understanding of the pathophysiology of certain ICU specific diseases.",

The \u00adobservable characteristics of an individual define that individual\u2019s phenotype. This may include common physical and biochemical characteristics, but can also describe a person\u2019s disease status (such as in cystic fibrosis). Phenotypes caused by mutations in a single gene may show Mendelian inheritance patterns. These patterns can be autosomal dominant (where a single copy of the gene causes the phenotype), autosomal recessive (where both copies of the gene are necessary for the phenotype), or sex linked (where the mutation occurs on the X chromosome). It is crucial to note that Mendelian inheritance patterns are only seen for single gene disorders.

In other words, a person\u2019s genetic background may make them prone to a specific disease; this is called susceptibility gene variants or susceptibility genes. Due to their inherited genetic make-up, the individual is at a higher inborn risk for developing the disease of interest, but only if they are exposed to the environmental stressor that is known to associate with the disease. The susceptibility gene variant will not directly lead to the disease, but will put that person at a higher risk if they are exposed to the environmental risk. For example, individuals may possess a susceptibility gene variant for the development of lung cancer, but this will only lead to the development of cancer if they are subject to a known environmental risk factor, such as smoking. Alternatively, a newborn may possess one or more susceptibility gene variants for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but if they are not born prematurely and do not require mechanical ventilation in the newborn period (and therefore are not subject to the environmental stressors known to impact the development of this lung disease), they will never develop this disease despite being genetically susceptible.\nDisease aggregation may be due to complex genetic factors, the interaction of multiple genes on the development of the disease of interest, a host of environmental factors which place the individual at risk for the disease, or, most commonly, a combination of all of the above factors.\n",

To give an example, there are individuals who smoke their entire adult lives and yet never develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is likely that these individuals possess protective gene variants against the development of this disease, even in the face of a strong environmental insult. A person may possess both susceptibility and protective genetic variants for the same disease, and the mix of these variants will impact together the overall genetic risk of that person to the disease of interest. This resultant genetic risk also interacts with the environmental risk of the individual, leading to the overall risk of that person developing the disease. In critical care, it is unlikely that one gene will cause the diseases that are treated in the intensive care unit; it is more likely that multiple genes will interact with multiple environmental insults to predispose individuals to diseases processes resulting in an overall risk for an individual patient to develop a certain disease of interest. Interestingly, certain populations seem to be immune to certain complex diseases. Examples include the Australian aborigines and Inuits from Greenland, in which both populations appear to be resistant to the development of type 1 diabetes. It is plausible that the disease resistance observed in these populations is due to absence of susceptibility gene variants or presence of protective gene variants in the group\u2019s gene pool.",

Examining gene expression may, therefore, provide a clue as to which genes are important in a specific critical illness. Many studies have examined gene expression in critically ill patients, but most examine the expression of only a few genes. With the advent of the DNA microarray technology discussed above investigators have begun to explore gene expression patterns in thousands of genes in children with septic shock using mRNA isolated from whole blood representing the gene expression response in circulating white blood cells. These studies have compared gene expression from blood samples obtained within 1 day of admission to the PICU with that observed in blood of healthy controls, examined longitudinal changes in gene expression in children with septic shock (days 1 and 3) and compared expression in patients with septic shock to expression in children with sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Genes that were up-regulated, down-regulated, or unchanged between the groups were examined. The genes that were up-regulated when the septic shock group was compared to healthy controls included genes related to immunity and inflammation as would be expected. Unexpectedly the study demonstrated that many genes related to zinc biology and zinc homeostasis were down-regulated. The significance of this finding was supported by the observation that children who did not survive septic shock had lower serum levels of zinc and the demonstration in a murine model that zinc depletion leads to increased mortality from sepsis. In addition, genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling and antigen presentation appeared decreased suggesting that septic shock may be associated with depression of the adaptive immune system. Interestingly expression studies of adults with sepsis and septic shock did not identify a down-regulation of genes related to zinc biology although up-regulation of genes related to immunity and inflammation and down-regulation of genes related to the adaptive immune system was observed.\nWith the advent of the DNA microarray technology, gene expression patterns in thousands of genes can lead to insight into disease pathogenesis, treatment, and outcome.\n",

Examples include the finding that up-regulated genes that were involved in the IL-10 signaling pathway had a greater signal which persisted for longer in the septic shock patients and down-regulation of genes for zinc biology and the adaptive immune system was greater and lasted longer than that seen in the other two groups. In addition to providing insight into the pathophysiology of sepsis and identifying potentially important proteins in early sepsis, the use of this technology may also provide physicians with a unique diagnostic tool. If the gene expression profile of a patient who is in the early stages of sepsis is different from a patient who exhibits SIRS but does not develop sepsis, then earlier therapies could be initiated before full blown sepsis is clinically evident. There is also some evidence that various subclasses of sepsis and septic shock may be able to be identified using this technique.",

In addition to the elevated mRNA levels, PBEF protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was also elevated in adults with ALI. It is also worth mentioning an important study in a canine model of lung injury to highlight the value of gene expression arrays. The use of mechanical ventilation is invariably needed to treat patients with ALI though the use of positive pressure ventilation itself may exacerbate the lung injury. Gene expression arrays in a canine model of ventilator associated lung injury have identified a number of genes that are regulated during ALI. Many of the genes can be grouped into biological processes known to important in the pathophysiology of ALI; these include inflammation (e.g., IL-1b, IL-6, IL-1ra, MMIF), coagulation (tissue factor, PAI-1), and chemotaxis/cell motility (myosin light chain kinase, cell chemokine receptor 2). Several other genes also appeared to be expressed including PBEF, heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Thus, the use of expression arrays has identified a number of candidate genes that may play important roles in the development of ALI.

Why one child with pneumococcal pneumonia has little consequence of their infection and can be treated as an outpatient while another child develops refractory septic shock and respiratory failure has been attributed to a number of factors. These have included virulence of the pathogen, length of time between onset of symptoms and appropriate treatment, and comorbid conditions. While all these certainly contribute to the severity of disease, a growing body of evidence suggests that genetic variations in the individual patient may also contribute to the severity of and outcome from critical disease. These genetic polymorphisms may not be of any consequence during normal healthy periods but their importance may only become evident during a severe stressor such as an infection, trauma, cardiopulmonary bypass, or other scenarios seen in the intensive care unit (Table 11.1). A strong genetic influence on the outcome from infections was indicated by a family based study of adoptees. Adoptees with a biological parent who died due to infection before the age of 50 had a relative risk of death due to infection of 5.81 (CI  =  2.47\u201313.7); a higher relative risk than that seen when risk related to early death of a biologic parent due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (4.52; 1.32\u201315.4) or cancer (1.19; 0.16\u20138.99) was examined.

Genetic variations that lead to alterations in the amount or functional activity of any of these proteins involved in the recognition of or response to pathogen-associated products may influence the individual\u2019s response. Examples of the influence of genetic variations in proteins involved in recognition of pathogens on the severity of infections include polymorphisms in the genes coding for mannose binding lectin (MBL), the receptor for Fc\u03b3, and toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. The heterotrimeric MBL is involved in binding bacterial surface carbohydrates and the opsonization of bacteria. A helical domain in the tertiary structure of the protein is crucial for formation of the active heterotrimer. Three genetic polymorphisms in the gene coding for MBL result in amino acid changes in the helical tails of the protein and result in increased degradation and decreased serum levels of MBL. Genetic association studies have demonstrated associations between the 3 MBL genetic polymorphisms and increased susceptibility to infections, hospitalizations due to infections, number of acute respiratory infections, and risk of meningococcal infections in children, and pneumonia and sepsis in neonates.

The mechanism by which this imbalance occurs is thought to be multi-factorial. One possibility that has attracted much interest is that the host may harbor genetic variations in the regulatory regions of genes involved in the response to noxious stimuli resulting in an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

As a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-\u03b1 is responsible for the activation of the inflammatory response and by itself can produce many of the clinical manifestations of sepsis such as capillary leak, hypotension, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The regulatory region of the gene coding for TNF-\u03b1 has several polymorphisms that alter transcription of TNF-\u03b1, thereby influencing the amount of TNF-\u03b1 produced. Several of these polymorphisms alter nucleotides which make up the recognition sequences of some of the transcription factors that regulate transcription. Two of these polymorphisms in particular have been studied. The rarer A allele (TNF-\u03b1-308) at a location 308 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site results in greater transcription than the more common G allele. A second rare A allele (TNF-\u03b1-238) at a location 238 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site results in lower transcription than the G allele. In addition, another site located \u223c3,200 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site of the TNF-\u03b1 gene and located in the gene coding for another gene, lymphotoxin (LT)-\u03b1, (also referred to as the TNFB allele, TNF-\u03b2  +  252, and LT-\u03b1  +  250) also appears to regulate transcription of the TNF-\u03b1 gene. In genetic association studies, the frequency of the TNF-\u03b1-308 A allele has been shown to be higher in children who died from meningococcal infections and adults who died with septic shock compared with controls. Genetic association studies examining the influence of the polymorphic LT-\u03b1  +  250 site has shown a higher frequency of the A allele in adults with pneumonia presenting with the clinical symptoms of sepsis, in adults in post-operative and trauma intensive care units who develop sepsis and who have a higher mortality, and in bacteremic children who exhibit higher serum TNF-\u03b1 levels and have a higher mortality. However other genetic association studies examining the TNF-\u03b1 gene have reported conflicting results. Recently a well designed, prospective study examining a number of polymorphisms in the gene for TNF-\u03b1 (including those described above) in adults with trauma admitted to the ICU demonstrated that the A allele of TNF-\u03b1-308 was associated with elevated TNF, sepsis syndrome and death in trauma patients both in their initial cohort and a replication cohort.

Loss of homeostatic mechanisms regulating the coagulation/fibrinolytic system also plays an important role in sepsis. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1(PAI-1) inhibits fibrinolysis thereby favoring the formation of microthrombi in the capillaries. The pathophysiology of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in patients with sepsis is thought to involve, in part, intravascular fibrin deposition. Thus, elevated PAI-1 activity could contribute to organ failure in sepsis and elevated plasma concentrations have been observed in patients with sepsis. A genetic variation in the gene coding for PAI-1 consisting of either the presence of 4 guanines or 5 guanines at a specific location appears to influence the amount of PAI-1 produced. Individuals homozygous for the 4G genotype (4G/4G) produce more PAI-1 than individuals homozygous for the 5G genotype (5G/5G) or individuals that are heterozygous (4G/5G). Association studies have demonstrated that children with meningococcal disease who were 4G/4G at this site had an increased risk of death compared to children who were 4G/5G or 5G/5G. More recent studies in both children and adults have demonstrated higher mortality in individuals homozygous for the 4G allele in a number of infectious diseases. Since fibrin deposition is thought to play a role in the multiple organ system failure in patients with sepsis, genetic variations that influence the production of fibrin might also influence the severity of disease in patients with sepsis. The production of fibrinogen, the precursor to fibrin, is dependent on the transcription of fibrinogen-beta. Several polymorphisms in the promoter region have been associated with higher plasma levels of fibrinogen, and higher levels of fibrinogen have been associated with improved outcomes in sepsis. Association studies have demonstrated that the GAA haplotype, consisting of the genotypes at the \u2212854, \u2212455, and +9006 sites, is associated with higher levels of fibrinogen and with decreased mortality and less organ dysfunction. Protein C has anticoagulant activity as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects suggesting that diminished activity of protein C may lead to increased fibrin deposition, inflammation, and apoptosis. Genetic polymorphisms located in the promoter region of the gene coding for protein C result in decreased levels. Association studies in Caucasian and Han Chinese adults have demonstrated increased mortality and organ dysfunction in adults with sepsis who carry the A allele at the \u22121641 site and the C allele at the \u22121654 site. This haplotype has also been reported to be associated with decreased protein C concentration. Interestingly, an increased risk of more severe sepsis has been observed in children less than 1 year of age with meningococcal disease who carry the G allele at the \u22121641 site along with the C allele at the \u22121654 site. This haplotype was not associated with severe sepsis in older children suggesting a potential developmental difference in these variations on the severity of sepsis.\nGenetic polymorphisms located in the promoter region of the gene coding for protein C result in decreased levels, and possibly an impact on mortality with sepsis.\n",

Major causes of direct lung injury include pneumonia, aspiration, pulmonary contusion, and inhalation while major causes of indirect injury include sepsis, trauma without pulmonary contusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, and multiple transfusions. Despite these various causes, the central pathogenesis of ALI involves derangements in multiple biological processes. These include activation of inflammation, loss of coagulation and fibrinolytic homeostasis, disruption of vascular permeability, epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis as well as proliferation, and derangements in surfactant. Some of these processes, notably inflammation and coagulation, play key roles in the pathophysiology of sepsis as well as ALI.

            "text": "Pulmonary surfactant is synthesized by the type II alveolar epithelial cells and is required for normal lung function. One of surfactant\u2019s primary functions is to lower the surface tension at the alveolar air-liquid interface. Surfactant is composed of phospholipids and four proteins, surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D. Knockout models in mice have demonstrated that of these four proteins, only SP-B is absolutely required for post-natal survival. Deficiency in, or impaired activity of SP-B appears responsible for a number of interstitial pulmonary diseases in humans including ARDS. Several genetic variations exist in the genes coding for the surfactant proteins and two will be discussed here; the SP-B  +  1580 T/C polymorphism and insertion/deletion polymorphism consisting of dinucleotide (CA) tandem repeats in intron 4. Several studies have demonstrated an association between these polymorphisms and the need for mechanical ventilation in children (SP-B  +  1580 T/C) and mechanical ventilation and ARDS in adults (SP-B  +  1580 T/C polymorphism and insertion/deletion of dinucleotide (CA) tandem repeats). The consequences of these variations are not fully known. The SP-B  +  1580 T/C polymorphism results in an amino acid change in exon 4 in a region of the amino terminal propeptide which is thought to play a role in targeting of SP-B to lamellar bodies. The resulting amino acid change alters glycosylation of SP-B and may affect the level of SP-B by altering its processing or stability. Aberrant proteolytic processing of the SP-B product encoded by the C allele is supported by a recent report demonstrating that the C allele is associated with absence of a specific pro-SP-B cleavage product in neonates. The intron 4 dinucleotide repeat length variation polymorphism is associated with incompletely spliced SP-B mRNA. Interestingly, in Caucasians this length variation polymorphism in intron 4 is in linkage disequilibrium with the SP-B  +  1580 T/C polymorphism; the C allele of rs1130866 is associated with the deletion variants at the intron 4 polymorphic site. Further work is needed to not only define the consequence of these genetic variations on surfactant function but also to further evaluate whether these genetic variations influence the development of ALI.",

As discussed above, the 4G/4G genotype in the gene coding for PAI-1 is associated with higher levels of PAI-1 expression. In a large cohort of adults, those individuals with the 4G allele demonstrated a significantly higher susceptibility to pneumonia. While PAI-1 activity inhibits fibrinolysis leading to formation of microthrombi, it also demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity, and in this fashion, may increase the susceptibility to infection. In patients with ALI, plasma levels of PAI-1 levels are elevated and protein C levels are diminished. In addition, alveolar levels of PAI-1 are elevated suggesting a possible local activation of the fibrinolytic system. Recent studies have demonstrated that the 4G allele of PAI-1 is associated with increased mortality in patients with severe pneumonia and patients with ARDS. To date there are no reports indicating association of specific protein C variants with ALI.",

Several transcription factors are involved in this process and genetic variation in any of these factors may influence the level of transcription. One such factor is nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) which under non-stimulated conditions is inhibited by the cytoplasmic inhibitor NF\u03baBIA. Upon activation of cytokine-mediated signal transduction pathways, NF\u03baBIA is degraded allowing NF-\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus. A number of polymorphisms located in the promoter region of the gene coding for NF\u03baBIA have been described but their functional consequence is unknown.

            "text": "The role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in lung injury has recently attracted uch interest. ACE is present in pulmonary endothelium and is responsible for converting ATI to ATII. ACE levels are elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of adults with ARDS and higher levels are associated with mortality from ARDS. The key component is most likely ATII, which has apoptotic effects on alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells in vitro. ATII receptor antagonists block pneumocyte apoptosis in a model of meconium aspiration. Another important component of this system is ACE2, a homologue of ACE expressed in human lungs, which is a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system as well as the probable receptor for the SARS virus in humans. Lung injury models using knockout mice lacking the ACE2 gene have higher ATII levels and exaggerated lung injury compared to wild type mice. However, the lung injury is reversed if the ACE gene is inactivated in the ACE2 knockout mice. This suggests that ACE induces lung injury through ATII and that ACE2 protects against lung injury. Indeed, ACE inhibitors and ATII antagonists appear to decrease the severity of lung injury in animal models, the risk of aspiration pneumonia in some adult populations, and reduce the 30-day mortality in adults with pneumonia. Several studies have demonstrated the D/D genotype appears associated with the susceptibility to and outcome from ARDS.",

However, these and many other genetic variations that exist in other components of the coagulation cascade could also influence the development of thrombosis including deep venous thrombosis in critically ill patients. Thrombosis of central venous catheters is a recurring problem in PICUs and while certain environmental factors play a role (eg, length of time catheter is in place, size of the patient and vessel), genetic polymorphisms in the patient favoring the formation of thrombi may also play a role.\nGenetic polymorphisms in genes coding for proteins involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis may be very important in the risk of bleeding and thrombosis in critically ill children.\n",

Whether it be inhaled \u03b22-agonists, or the array of intravenous vasoactive agents, sedatives, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, steroids, etc.; all bind to protein receptors and either activate or block specific signal transduction pathways, many bind protein carriers or transporters, and most are metabolized by various protein enzymes. Every gene coding for each of these proteins has multiple genetic variations with the potential to influence the levels or activities of these proteins. The area of pharmacogenomics attempts to determine the influence of genetic variations in genes affecting these various aspects of drug action. However, while the list of genetic polymorphisms in genes affecting drug action is growing rapidly, there are few clinical examples of the degree of influence that these genetic variations have on the response to drugs in the PICU. For example, warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant for long-term prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders and is used in many children and adults with mechanical valves. The metabolism of and response to warfarin involves several enzymes, two of which exhibit genetic variations that dramatically alter the levels of warfarin. For one of these genes, CYP2C9, the common allele is referred to as CYP2C9*1 and is consider the wildtype while CYP2C9*2 contains a C to T nucleotide change at position 430 in exon 3 and CYP2C9*3 contains an A to C nucleotide change in exon 7. CYP2C9*2 has approximately 80% of the metabolic activity of the wild type CYP2C9*1 while CYP2C9*3 contains only 20% of the wildtype activity. By also using genetic variation in a second gene, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 or VKORC1, one can account for more than 50% of the observed dosing variability. Current practice in the use of warfarin usually involves starting at an age and weight specific dose and monitoring coagulation studies. However, because of the genetic variations in these two enzymes and perhaps others, different patients take different amounts of time to achieve the appropriate therapeutic dose. Knowing the specific genotypes of patients prior to initiating warfarin may allow for more appropriate dose selection, less time to achieve therapeutic levels, and less risk of adverse events. Recently, an algorithm using the patient\u2019s genotypes at these two sites has been developed that allows for more accurate dosing in some populations. Although these algorithms are being developed and tested it should be kept in mind that they do not account for drug-drug interactions.\nThe area of pharmacogenomics attempts to determine the influence of genetic variations in genes affecting the various aspects of drug action.\n",
