It is maintained in migratory waterfowl and can infect many species including humans, birds, pigs, horses, and other animals. The virus genome contains eight segments that code for 10 or 11 proteins. Three segments encode the polymerase complex: basic polymerase 2 (PB2), basic polymerase 1 (PB1), and the acidic protein (PA). The nucleoprotein segment (NP) encodes a protein that binds to viral RNA. The matrix segment (MP) encodes two proteins: a structural component of the viral capsid and a membrane ion channel. The nonstructural segment (NS) encodes a protein essential for cellular RNA processing and transport. Two other segments, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), encode viral surface glycoproteins responsible for host cell entry and exit, respectively [7], [8].

This paper reports multidisciplinary research, involving several diverse fields. As such, we must necessarily cover a wide range of issues in order to provide a clear understanding of our methods and results. It is important to describe many of the low-level implementation details to allow other researchers to appreciate the complexities of this project and pursue its applications and extensions. In particular, we cover the details of data gathering and processing that were necessary to create the database that is at the center of this work. The issues of parallel computation, both on a distributed memory commodity cluster as well as on a shared-memory massively multithreaded supercomputer are also covered, as the reassortment algorithm could not be run in an acceptable amount of time without these. Finally, the presentation of output as \u201cin-trees\u201d that capture both mutation and reassortment is important for interpretation and evaluation of our results.",

Although expressed as functions, these are really machine operations that are executed in one clock cycle, leading to very efficient, fine grained synchronization. This behavior is possible because the Cray XMT supercomputer has special synchronization bits with each memory location. An illustration of synchronization is provided in the online Supplemental Material, Appendix H. Notice how variables are declared only in the scopes where they are used. This ensures that if a loop is parallelized, the corresponding thread will have an independent copy of the variable, thus eliminating contention.\n",

In these loops, we had to ensure that all accesses to shared variables were safely parallelizable. This is easy to do, since the XMT compiler will indicate unsafe parallelization (i.e., situations where there are accesses to shared locations without appropriate synchronization). Full/Empty operations, readfe(.) and writeef(.), as described above, were used in such situations. In a few cases, loops had to be restructured so as to allow efficient parallelization.",

If a high threshold (or no threshold) is used, all evolutionary paths will be only a few edges long, thus obscuring fine grained information on mutations and reassortments. If a zero threshold is used, no path will be found (as the target will be disconnected from the rest of the graph). For our 5, 016 virus, 35 stage problem, we found that 500 was a choice of threshold that gave useful information.

            "text": "It is of great interest to compare the reassortments in the paths of Tables 4 and 5 against the models described in Section 3. We consider a reassortment indicated in our in-tree as matching a reassortment in Figs. 3, 4, or 5, if there is a path in the figures matching (in terms of subtype, host) the reassortment from the in-tree. For example, in Table 4 the three-edge path for 1977 gets PB1 from H3N2 swine. There is a path from H3N2 swine to SOIV in each of Figs. 3, 4, and 5.",
