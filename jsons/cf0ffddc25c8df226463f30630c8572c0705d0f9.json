            "text": "Rapid advances in bioengineering and biotechnology over the past three decades have greatly facilitated the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. Affinity-based methods that employ protein or peptide based tags for protein purification have been instrumental in this progress. Yet insolubility of recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a persistent problem. One way around this problem is to fuse an aggregation-prone protein to a highly soluble partner. E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) is widely acknowledged as a highly effective solubilizing agent. In this chapter, we describe how to construct either a His 6 -or a dual His 6 -MBP tagged fusion protein by Gateway \u00ae recombinational cloning and how to evaluate their yield and solubility. We also describe a simple and rapid procedure to test the solubility of proteins after removing their N-terminal fusion tags by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease digestion. The choice of whether to use a His 6 tag or a His 6 -MBP tag can be made on the basis of this solubility test.",

            "text": "A major time-consuming process in nearly all structural and functional studies of proteins is their overproduction and purification. Recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli has become the most popular platform for researchers who require large amounts of protein. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) with a polyhistidine tag (usually six consecutive histidine residues) has emerged as the most common and convenient method for purifying recombinant proteins. However, many Histagged proteins form insoluble aggregates, especially in E. coli [1] . Before abandoning bacterial expression in favor of more complicated and costly eukaryotic systems, we suggest employing a simple strategy that combines the solubility-enhancing benefit conferred by E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) [2, 3] with the powerful advantage of IMAC [4] , made possible by the use of a polyhistidine tag in a tandem configuration with MBP (His 6 -MBP) [5] . In this chapter, we describe how to construct either a His 6tagged or His 6 -MBP tagged fusion protein and conduct a few simple pilot experiments that are reliable predictors of protein production success, prior to extensive resource investment. The outcome of these pilot experiments dictates which N-terminal tag (His 6 or His 6 -MBP) should be used for large-scale protein production.",

Next we perform successive BP and LR reactions. The 3\u2032 ends of the primers include a sufficient number of nucleotides that are complementary to the template sequence to result in a 69 \u00b0C melting temperature (by modified Breslauer's method, see http://www.thermoscientificbio. com/webtools/tmc/). This enables two-step PCR cycling using 72 \u00b0C as both the annealing and extension temperature. Proximal to the ORF-specific part of the forward primer, we add a sequence that encodes a TEV protease cleavage site preceded by an attB1 site to enable recombination. Because shorter primers are less expensive and because the TEV-and attB1-containing sequences are common to many of our experimental designs, we often use two overlapping forward primers, only one of which is ORFspecific ( Fig. 1 ). An attB2 recombination site is added to the 5\u2032 end of the ORF-specific portion of the reverse PCR primer. During early rounds of cycling, the inner, ORF-specific forward primer (N1) acts with the reverse primer (C) to create a template amplified by N2 and the same reverse primer in later rounds. To favor full-length product accumulation, the concentration of N1 is 20-fold lower than that of N2 and C (see Note 8).",

Placing the total and soluble fractions next to each other on the gel allows easy comparison and determination of solubility.

The prominent band corresponding to ChikV protease indicates that it remains soluble after cleavage from MBP, suggesting that it is probably properly folded. Similarly, the cleavage of His 6 -tagged MERS-CoV 3CL pro was conducted and lanes 3 and 4 indicate the soluble protein and soluble products of TEV digestion, respectively. The cleaved His 6 -tag and the MERS-CoV 3CL pro (33-kDa) are clearly visible on the gel. Had the TEV protease failed to cleave the fusions or had the target protein become insoluble after cleavage, troubleshooting would have been necessary. Otherwise, having successfully passed these diagnostic tests, the production and purification of the protein may now be scaled up as described [4] . Not every fusion protein (His 6 -tagged or His 6 -MBP tagged) will be highly soluble. However, solubility usually can be increased by reducing the temperature of the culture from 30 to 18 \u00b0C during the time that the fusion protein is accumulating in the cells (i.e., after the addition of IPTG). In some cases, the improvement can be quite dramatic. It may also be helpful to reduce the IPTG concentration to a level that will result in partial induction of the fusion protein. Under these conditions, longer induction times (18-24 h) are required to achieve a reasonable yield.",

Exactly how and why this occurs is unclear, but we suspect that fusion to MBP somehow enables certain proteins to evolve into kinetically trapped folding intermediates that are no longer susceptible to aggregation. Therefore, although solubility after intracellular processing is generally a useful indicator of a passenger protein's folding state, it is not absolutely trustworthy. For this reason, we strongly recommend employing a biological assay (if available) at an early stage to confirm that the passenger protein is in its native conformation. For those proteins that are soluble as His 6 -tagged fusions, there is no need to use a solubility enhancer for large-scale expression and purification.",

Electrotransformation procedures can be obtained from the electroporator manufacturers (e.g., Bio-Rad, BTX, Eppendorf). Immediately prior to electrotransformation, the cells are thawed on ice and mixed with 10-100 ng of DNA (e.g., a plasmid vector or a Gateway \u00ae reaction). The mixture is placed in an ice-cold electroporation cuvette and electroporated according to the manufacturer's recommendations (e.g., 1.5 kV pulse in a cuvette with a 1 mm gap). One milliliter of SOC medium [9] is immediately added to the cells and they are allowed to grow at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (ca. 250 rpm) for 1 h. 5-200 \u03bcl of the cells are then spread on an LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic(s). 6 . If the open reading frame encoding the passenger protein contains codons that are rarely used in E. coli (http://www.doembi.ucla.edu/cgi/cam/racc.html), this can adversely affect the yield of a protein. In such cases, it is advisable that the expression strain carries an additional plasmid that codes for rare-codon-tRNA genes. The pRIL plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) is a derivative of the p15A replicon that carries the E. coli argU, ileY, and leuW genes, which encode the cognate tRNAs for AGG/AGA, AUA, and CUA codons, respectively. pRIL is selected for by resistance to chloramphenicol. In addition to the tRNA genes for AGG/AGA, AUA, and CUA codons, the pRARE accessory plasmid in the Rosetta\u2122 host strain (Novagen, Madison, WI) also includes tRNAs for the rarely used CCC and GGA codons. Like pRIL, the pRARE plasmid is a chloramphenicol-resistant derivative of the p15A replicon. Both of these tRNA accessory plasmids are compatible with derivatives of pDEST566, pDEST-HisMBP or pDEST527. Another option is to prepare the insert (cDNA of interest) synthetically, using E. coli-preferred codons.",
