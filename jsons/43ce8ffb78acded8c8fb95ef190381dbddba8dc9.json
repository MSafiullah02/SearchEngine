In both farms, at least one worker had been found positive for SARS-CoV-2. Necropsies of the mink revealed interstitial pneumonia, and organ and swab samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by qPCR. Variations in viral genomes point at between-mink transmission on the farms and lack of infection link between the farms. Inhalable dust in the mink houses contained viral RNA, indicating possible exposure of workers.",

The virus is spreading efficiently among people, causing predominantly respiratory disease with varying degree of severity. The virus was also shown to infect a number of animal species under experimental conditions. Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, ferrets, cats and golden Syrian hamsters supported viral replication in respiratory tract [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and some of those species (rhesus macaques, juvenile cats and hamsters) displayed a mild to moderate clinical disease. Besides the experimental infections, occasional spill-over from humans to domestic or captive animals has been reported. In a few isolated cases cats and dogs owned by infected individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA [10, 11] , and occasionally, cats also displayed clinical disease. Recently, several tigers in the Bronx zoo with respiratory symptoms were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. In all cases a direct correlation with infected humans was established, or at least other sources of infection were excluded [10] .",

In both farms, Covid-19 like symptoms were present in individuals working on the farms before signs in mink were seen, and infection was confirmed in one hospitalized person. The sequences obtained from the two farms are closely related to known human sequences, and the distance between the sequence clusters from the two farms suggests separate introductions. The most likely explanation of the widespread infection in the mink farms is introduction of the virus by humans and subsequent transmission amongst the minks. In the mink farms, the animals are caged separately with non-permeable partition between cages, precluding direct contact as a mode of transmission. Indirect transmission between minks could either be through fomites (e.g. by feed or bedding material provided by humans), by infectious droplets generated by the infected animals, or by (fecally-) contaminated dust from the bedding. Detection of viral RNA in the airborne inhalable dust in the mink farms clearly suggests dust and/or droplets as means of transmission between the minks and occupational risk of exposure for the workers on the farms.",
