Pelargonium genus comprises more than 750 species, and most of them originated from Europe and Africa. They have remarkable commercial applications due to their characteristic essential oil. The essential oil distillate of a high-value Geraniaceae plant, rose-scented geranium ( Fig. 12. 1), has a very strong, pleasant and rosy fragrance with a minty top; therefore, it is used as a substitution of the expensive rose oil, and is also known as 'poor man's rose oil'. The essential oil of rose-scented geranium was extensively used as a flavouring agent in the food, cosmetic, perfumery, and pharmaceutical industries. The rose-scented geranium essential oil is also well known for its effectiveness in various health-related treatments such as aromatherapy and for its antimicrobial properties (Narnoliya et al. , 2018a Jadaun et al. 2017) . In India, geranium was introduced in the oxides, terpineol, pinene and myrcene (Jadaun et al. 2017; Ravindra and Kulkarni 2015) . Thus, terpenes are the major contributors in the essential oil of rose-scented geranium, and these terpenes are biosynthesized through the terpenoid pathway. It was less explored in terms of its genomics, transcriptomics, gene expression and enzyme characterization. Recently, the transcriptomic information of rose-scented geranium leaf has been reported, which provides a foundation for the molecular study of primary and secondary metabolism (Narnoliya et al. , 2018a . Recently, a gene, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) was cloned from this plant and its recombinant protein was physico-kinetically characterized and heterologously overexpressed in Withania somnifera to evaluate the effect of DXS on withanolides (Jadaun et al. 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 953, "end": 978, "text": "(Narnoliya et al. , 2018a", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 979, "end": 998, "text": "Jadaun et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1100, "text": "(Jadaun et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1128, "text": "Ravindra and Kulkarni 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1601, "text": "(Narnoliya et al. , 2018a", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1862, "end": 1882, "text": "(Jadaun et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 437, "end": 445, "text": "Fig. 12.", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Hence, recent genomics and functionality studies provided a platform to enhance the quantity and quality of essential oil.

Aroma and fragrance of an oil depend on its composition. Essential oil of geranium contains more than 200 types of organic compounds, of which, terpenes, phenylpropanoids, and some other low molecular weight phytoconstituents occur predominantly (Table 12 .1). Terpenes constitute the major part of essential oil. Terpene is composed of a five-carbon isoprene unit (CH 2 -C (CH 3 )-CH-CH 2 ). The common formula of terpene is (C 5 H 8 ) n, where 'n' is the number of isoprene units. Further, depending on the number of isoprene units, terpenes are classified into different categories such as monoterpenes (2 isoprene units, i.e., 10 carbons), sesquiterpenes (3 isoprene units, i.e., 15 carbons), diterpenes (4 isoprene units, i.e., 20 carbons), triterpenes (6 isoprene units, i.e., 30 carbons) and tetraterpenes (8 isoprene units, i.e., 40 carbons). In essential oil, these terpenes are present either in their simple form or in alcoholic, ketonic, aldehyde, and ester forms, and sometimes as chlorinated or oxygenated derivatives. On the basis of carbon arrangement, these terpenes are present in different structures like acyclic, monocyclic, and bicyclic structures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 338, "end": 347, "text": "(Table 12", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Phytochemical Composition of Geranium"}, {"text": "The other main component of essential oil is phenylpropanoid, a derivative of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine, synthesized via the shikimic acid pathway.

Thus, essential oil is the key component of rose-scented geranium, and its content in geranium ranges from 0.06% to 0.16%. Approximately 20-170 kg/ha of essential oil was produced by the growers in different locations (Rao 2009 ). On the basis of available reports in the literature, it is confirmed that citronellol, geraniol, linalool, and citronellyl formate are the major phytoconstituents of geranium essential oil, but their ratio is variable with cultivation zone and season (D\u017eami\u0107 et al. 2014) . Geranium, grown in Tajikistan, showed that 79 compounds acquire 95.1% of the total essential oil. In this essential oil, 37.5% citronellol, 6% geraniol, 3.7% caryophyllene oxide, 3.1% menthone, 3% linalool, 2.7% \u03b2-bourbonene, 2.1% isomenthone, 2.0% geranyl formate, and 3.1% menthone were reported to be present (Sharopov et al. 2014) . Citronellol (36.4%), and citronellyl formate (12.1%) were also found as main components of oil isolated from aerial parts of geranium, grown in Isfahan Province and Central Iran (Ghannadi et al. 2012) . Essential oil of aerial parts of geranium grown in Dr. Josif Pan\u010di\u0107, an institute of medicinal plants, Belgrade, was reported to contain 55 compounds, constituting 99.32% in weight of total oil in which 59.74% and 0.49% comprises oxygenated monoterpenes and monoterpene hydrocarbons, respectively. Citronellol (24.54%), geraniol (15.33%), citronellyl formate (10.66%) and linalool (9.80%) are present predominantly (D\u017eami\u0107 et al. 2014 ).

There is also a clear ageing effect on the composition of oil in geranium, as shown in a report by Rajeswara Rao et al. (1993) that essential oil yield (1.56%) and geraniol content (34.6%) were the highest in the youngest leaf. Essential oil yield not only varies with different cultivars, but even the same cultivar may produce essential oil of altered composition in different seasons. Different cultivars of geranium, such as Bourbon, CIM-Pawan and Kelkar, showed variations in essential oil production from 0.05% to 0.12%, depending on the season of its cultivation (Verma et al. 2014) . Oil composition fluctuates with climatic conditions, as citronellol-, nerol-, geraniol-and menthone-rich oil was obtained from plants grown in temperate climates of high-altitude regions; on the other side, isomenthone-, linalool-, citronellyl formate-rich oil was found in plants grown in lower altitudes (Rajeswara Rao et al. 1990) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1412, "end": 1421, "text": "Geraniol;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1434, "text": "isogeraniol;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1446, "text": "isopulegol;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1447, "end": 1453, "text": "nerol;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1454, "end": 1463, "text": "linalool;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1464, "end": 1472, "text": "menthol;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1484, "text": "isomenthol;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1485, "end": 1499, "text": "neoisomenthol;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1500, "end": 1512, "text": "citronellol;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1521, "text": "borneol;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1533, "text": "isoborneol;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1595, "end": 1611, "text": "(Friedrich 1976;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1612, "end": 1632, "text": "Dudareva et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1854, "end": 1863, "text": "(Rao 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2118, "end": 2138, "text": "(D\u017eami\u0107 et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2453, "end": 2475, "text": "(Sharopov et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2678, "text": "(Ghannadi et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3096, "end": 3115, "text": "(D\u017eami\u0107 et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 4616, "end": 4626, "text": "(Rao 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 4627, "end": 4647, "text": "Sangwan et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 4648, "end": 4666, "text": "Verma et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 4667, "end": 4686, "text": "Cannon et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 4798, "end": 4815, "text": "Rao et al.

Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), generated from both the pathways, function as precursors for manufacturing a plethora of terpenes. Terpenes are biosynthesized as a result of several enzymatic reactions catalyzed by terpene synthase enzymes. For many years, MVA was thought to be solely responsible for the synthesis of terpenes, but radioactive tracer experiments revealed the discovery of the MEP pathway for terpene biosynthesis (Lichtenthaler 1999; Eisenreich et al. 2004) .

This HMG-CoA is reduced into mevalonic acid (MVA) by the action of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). Mevalonic acid kinase (MVK) and phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) further convert MVA into mevalonate diphosphate through the phosphorylation process. Mevalonate-5-diphosphate decarboxylase (MPD) catalyses an ATP-coupled decarboxylation reaction for the production of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). IPP can be converted into dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) by an enzyme, IPP/DMAPP isomerase (IDI) (Fig. 12.2 ). Recently, a modified MVA pathway was proposed in which mevalonate-5-phosphate underwent decarboxylation forming isopentenylphosphate, which can be transformed into isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) by the enzyme isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK) (Chen and Poulter 2010; Hayakawa et al. 2017 ). D-Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate are the precursor molecules in the MEP pathway. They condense together and form the first intermediate 1-deoxy-Dxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP). In the next step, DXP is reductively isomerized by reducto-isomerase (DXR/IspC) into MEP and subsequently couples with cytidine 5\u2032-triphosphate (CTP), generating methyl erythritol cytidyl diphosphate (CDP-ME) by CDP-ME synthetase (IspD).

HDL and LDL were different in many agronomically important traits, such as flowering time, plant height, canopy size and the number of branches and, the most important one, essential oil composition. After greenhouse trials these morphotypes were grown and observed for genetic stability (Saxena et al. 2008a, b) .

In this process, the somatic cell or group of somatic cell is developed into an embryo or plants after passing through specific embryological stages without undergoing callus formation (Finer 1995) . Somatic embryogenesis helps in raising identical plants as parental with fewer chances of variations. Slimmon et al. (1991) optimized somatic embryogenesis in geranium (Pelargonium x hortorum Bailey cv. Scarlet Orbit Improved) and they reported that along with indole acetic acid, other non-indolic compounds like phenylacetic acid (PAA) were capable of inducing somatic embryogenesis (Slimmon et al. 1991) . For production of somatic embryo of zonal geranium, petioles and hypocotyls and, for regal geranium, petioles were used as explants (Marsolais et al. 1991) . TDZ plays an important role in somatic embryogenesis of geranium, and it was further proved by its application on different explants such as intact seedlings, etiolated hypocotyls and cotyledons Visser et al. 1992; Hutchinson et al. 1997; Haensch 2004) . Croke and Cassells (1997) reported the formation of putative somatic embryos from Pelargonium x hortorum Baily using petioles as explants in TDZ-supplemented MS media. Different factors affecting somatic embryogenesis were also studied such as hormonal doses, pH, basal media composition and genotype. In the case of Pelargonium \u00d7 hederifolium 'Bonete', when petioles were used as explants, adventitious shoot formation occurred through a mixed role of organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis mode of regeneration. Presence of TDZ along with IBA during the induction phase enhances the rate of formation of adventitious structures, and subsequently, improvement was observed in development of shoots (Wojtania et al. 2004) . Somatic embryogenesis was also induced in Pelargonium sidoides DC, using somatic cells of inflorescence, shoots and petioles in the presence of TDZ (Duchow et al. 2015) . Presence of a symbiotic bacterium positively influenced the somatic embryogenesis phenomenon in P. x hortorum (cv. Ringo Rose) (Visser-Tenyenhuis et al. 1994) .

In this study, they optimized different factors responsible for enhancement of transformation efficiency such as nature and source of explants, type and concentration of phytohormone and, most importantly, addition of a phenolic substance acetosyringone (100 \u03bcM) in the pre-culture and co-cultivation period. Transgenic geranium (Pelargonium sp. 'Frensham') plants were raised through Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation, and the binary vector had a gene encoding an antimicrobial protein, Ace-AMP1. The transgenic plants showed resistance against Botrytis cinerea, a pathogen causing leaf infection (Bi et al. 1999) . Transgenic plants of Pelargonium x hortorum and P. capitatum were generated using a modified transformation protocol with two strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, EHA101 and LBA440 (Hassanein et al. 2005) . Many more attempts were made to improve the agronomic traits of geranium such as improvement in oil quality (Saxena et al. 2007 ). Winkelmann et al.

Traditionally, it is used for treatment of several diseases due to its unique pharmacological properties. Significant work has been undertaken for improvements in its agronomic traits; however, the functional characterization of genes related to its primary as well as secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, especially essential oil biosynthesis pathway, is required at a more vigorous pace. Further, their regulatory elements should be identified and isolated so that the pathway machinery could be manipulated in a desired direction. The protocols for in vitro regeneration and plant transformation were well optimized, which are helpful in incorporation of favourable traits in geranium crop. However, the limitation in geranium is that it has so many species and cultivars, which differ at a high level in their morphology and ploidy level, so any technique optimized for one cultivar may or may not work for another cultivar. Therefore, extensive research is required to enhance the market value of a wide range of cultivars. The industrial importance of geranium depends on the quality of essential oil, so efforts are needed to produce such varieties, which can sustain challenges in the marketing route. Therefore, there is a need to produce improved genotypes, either through classical breeding or through genetic engineering approaches, so that plants with improved essential oil profiling and yield, which exhibit resistance to cold seasons and drought, good aroma, large flower size, altered flower colour and disease-resistant properties can be developed. Interspecific hybridization for the pyramiding of desirable genes can be beneficial in obtaining high oil-yielding varieties.
