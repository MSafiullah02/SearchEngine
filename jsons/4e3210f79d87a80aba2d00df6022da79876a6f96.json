            "text": "In Brief Thiele et al. show that importin-a3 is one of the major nuclear transporters of NF-kB in the mammalian lung. High-level TNF-a-inducing HPAIVs inhibit importin-a3 mRNA transcription by interfering with its promoter activity. Thus, HPAIVs may evade antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract by generating a bottleneck in importin-a3 availability. INTRODUCTION Molecular trafficking of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is a fundamental process that is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis (G\u00f6 rlich and Mattaj, 1996; Imamoto et al., 1995) . Disturbances in these highly sensitive regulatory processes may result in the disequilibrium of cellular and nuclear proteins and eventually cause diseases. Importin-a proteins belong to the major nuclear transport factors in the cell shuttling various cargo proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Goldfarb et al., 2004) . Importin-a proteins are acidophilic proteins that bind as adaptors to cargo proteins containing a basic stretch of mono-or bipartite NLS motifs. This importin-a/cargo complex forms a trimeric complex with the receptor protein importin-b 1 , which finally translocates through the nuclear pore by the interaction of importin-b 1 with nucleoporins (Hu et al., 1996; Radu et al., 1995; Rexach and Blobel, 1995) . In the nucleus, the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound form of Ran binds to importin-b 1 and mediates the dissociation and release of the cargo protein into the nucleus (Lee et al., 2005; Matsuura and Stewart, 2005) . After successful nuclear import, importin-a binds to the recycling factor cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein (CAS) that, in conjunction with RanGTP, transports the complex back into the cytoplasm where importin-a is again available for the nuclear import of other cargo proteins (Kutay et al., 1997) . Importina proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution (Goldfarb et al., 2004) . In eukaryotes, seven importin-a isoforms were described, whereas the budding yeast encodes one importina, and flies and nematodes encode for three importin-a isoforms. However, all of these organisms encode for only one importin-b 1 receptor protein. The specificity of importin-a isoforms to cargo proteins is determined by the complexity and the three-dimensional context (Friedrich et al., 2006; Goldfarb et al., 2004; Sankhala et al., 2017) . Moreover, importin-a proteins play a key role in cellular differentiation by regulating the transport of transcription factors through lineage-specific expression profiles in cells (Yasuhara et al., 2007) . However, little is known about the expression profiles of importin-a isoforms in organs that could give important insights into molecular mechanisms in health and disease. There is accumulating evidence that under cellular stress, such as oxidative stress, heat shock, or ultraviolet irradiation, importin-a proteins may accumulate in the nucleus and disrupt cellular homeostasis (Furuta et al., 2004; Kodiha et al., 2004; Yasuda et al., 2012) . In the last decade, a growing amount of evidence suggests that importin-a proteins are utilized by various viruses (e.g., influenza, Ebola, dengue, hepatitis C, and coronaviruses) to circumvent host defense mechanisms (Basler and Amarasinghe, 2009; Canton et al., 2018; Fraser et al., 2014; Frieman et al., 2007; Gabriel et al., 2011; Hudjetz and Gabriel, 2012; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Neufeldt et al., 2013; Pryor et al., 2007) . Little evidence is available on their mode of action in specific organs under inflammatory conditions such as virus infections. In this study, we identified the anatomic expression profile of importin-a isoforms in the mammalian lung and studied their transcriptional regulation and impact on influenza-virusinduced pneumonia using cell culture models, genome-wide transcription analyses, and transgenic mouse models.",

Importin-a1, -a3, and -a5/7 isoforms (Kpna2, Kpna4, and Kpna1/6, respectively) were abundantly expressed in epithelial cells, glands, and macrophages of the human ( Figure 1A ) as well as the murine URT and LRT ( Figure 1B ). We then measured the relative mRNA expression levels of importin-a isoforms along the mammalian RT. In the human URT and LRT, importin-a3 was by far the most abundantly expressed isoform, with 4-5 times increased mRNA levels compared to importin-a1. Average expression levels of other isoforms were similar to those of importin-a1, except for importin-a7, which was the second-most abundant isoform (Figure 1C) . Similarly, importin-a3 was also the highest-expressed isoform, followed by importin-a7 in the murine URT and LRT. Laser-based microdissection of epithelial cells was used to ensure homogeneous cell populations ( Figure 1D ). We further confirmed the exclusive abundance of importin-a3 in the murine lung, followed by importin-a7 as the second-most abundant isoform also on the protein level, using whole-organ homogenates (Figures 1E and 1F) . Notably, in immortalized cells (Figures S1A-S1D) and unlike in primary cells, importin-a1 is the most abundant isoform and is therefore used as a prognostic cancer marker (Christiansen and Dyrskj\u00f8t, 2013; Dahl et al., 2006; Kau et al., 2004) . Thus, it is particularly important to investigate the role of importin-a isoforms either in primary cells or in an in vivo animal model. We then determined the expression of importin-a isoforms in various murine organs on the mRNA and protein levels and confirmed that the lung ( Figure S1E ) is unique in exhib-iting exclusively high importin-a3 levels, compared to other solid organs (Figures S1F-S1K). Moreover, comparable distribution and expression levels of importin-a isoforms within the human and murine RT suggest that the mouse model may be considered adequate to study the impact and mode-of-action of these cellular factors in health and disease. Next, we directly compared relative importin-a amounts in laser-microdissected epithelial samples of the URT versus the LRT (Figures 1G-1K ). For all importin-a isoforms, mRNA levels were highest in the alveolar tissue (LRT (A), up to 6 times) followed by epithelial cells of the bronchi and bronchioles (LRT [bronchiolar epithelium, BE]). The lowest mRNA levels were detected in epithelial cells of the nasal concha (URT). Thus, importin-a isoforms are expressed as a gradient in the RT with gradually increasing mRNA levels from the URT toward the LRT ( Figure 1L ). However, importin-a3 is the most abundantly expressed importin-a isoform in the mammalian RT, unlike in other solid organs.",

Herein, particularly importin-a3 and its close relative, importin-a4, were shown to act as one of the main isoforms that imports tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a)-activated p50/p65 heterodimers into the nucleus via direct interaction (Fagerlund et al., 2005) . Since the mammalian lung most abundantly expresses the importin-a3 isoform, we continued to dissect the physical and functional interaction between importin-a3 and NF-kB. We could confirm that purified human importin-a3 protein directly interacts with NF-kB p50 and p65 subunits as well as with its precursor p105 protein upon activation with TNF-a unlike importin-a1 that was used as a negative control (Figures 2A and 2B) . Consistently, treatment of murine fibroblasts with TNF-a most significantly increased NF-kB levels in nuclear cell fractions along with importin-a3 ( Figure 2C ). In order to confirm that importin-a3 is required for the nuclear import of NF-kB, we generated murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) with a deleted importin-a3 gene (a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 ). Nuclear fractionation analysis in TNF-a-treated a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs showed significantly reduced nuclear translocation of the NF-kB subunit p65 compared to wild-type (WT) control (a3 +/+ ) MEFs ( Figure 2D ). Immunofluorescence analysis further confirmed that nuclear localization of NF-kB p65 was also reduced in a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs compared to a3 +/+ MEFs ( Figure 2E ). Conversely, NF-kB p65 accumulated in the cytoplasm of a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs, albeit slightly, likely due to the degradation of inefficiently transported cargo proteins ( Figure 2E ). The extent of reduced nuclear localization of importin-a3 was dependent on the method used, albeit the absence of importin-a3 consistently impaired efficient nuclear localization of TNF-a-induced NF-kB subunit p65. These data clearly show that importin-a3 acts as a nuclear translocator of TNF-a-activated NF-kB.",

These findings might suggest that importin-a3 gene expression itself could also be affected by TNF-a treatment. In order to understand how importin-a3 gene transcription is regulated, we screened the promoter region of the importin-a3 gene for the presence of potential transcription factor binding sites. We found that the promoter region of the importin-a3 gene contains a binding site for NF-kB, as shown by earlier chromatin immunoprecipitation studies (Raskatov et al., 2012) ( Figure 2H) . Consistently, using a reporter construct encoding for renilla luciferase under the control of the importin-a3 promoter, we could show that importin-a3 gene expression is differentially affected upon TNF-a treatment in a cell-type-and dose-dependent manner ( Figures 2I-2K ). In clinically relevant primary human airway epithelial cells as well as in generated MEFs herein, importin-a3 promoter activity was highest upon low-dose TNF-a treatment, while high-dose TNF-a treatment resulted in a reduction of importin-a3 gene expression ( Figures 2J and 2K ).

Next, we wanted to assess whether TNF-a-activated NF-kB is directly involved in regulating importin-a3 gene transcription. Therefore, we used cells deficient in the NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO), the regulatory subunit of the IKK (IkB kinase), which is required for NF-kB phosphorylation and thus its activation. Importin-a3 mRNA levels were reduced in TNFa-treated NEMO \u00c0/\u00c0 cells compared to untreated controls (Figure 2L) . As expected, reduced importin-a3 mRNA levels also resulted in reduced importin-a3 protein expression in NEMO \u00c0/\u00c0 cells treated with TNF-a as compared to untreated cells (Figure 2M) . Reduced importin-a3 expression in NEMO \u00c0/\u00c0 cells could be restored upon transfection of a NEMO-expressing plasmid back into NEMO \u00c0/\u00c0 cells ( Figure 2M ). Control treatment of NEMO \u00c0/\u00c0 cells with IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-g or TGF-b showed similarly reduced importin-a3 mRNA expression levels as upon TNF-a treatment ( Figure 2N ). It is important to note that IL-6 transcription is directly dependent on NF-kB, unlike IL-10, IFN-g or TGF-b. These findings support the concept that TNF-a-activated NF-kB is crucial for importin-a3 gene expression. However, other cytokines might also reduce importin-a3 expression at high, but not low, cytokine concentrations (Figure S2C) . Our findings support the concept that importin-a3 gene expression is controlled by TNF-a-activated NF-kB in a cell-and dose-dependent manner. This is in line with general control mechanisms in cells, such as negative or positive feedback loops, where gene transcription is regulated (e.g., either by activating or blocking the promoter, respectively, depending on demand) ( Figure 2O ). However, other, not yet defined, NF-kBindependent pathways might also affect importin-a3 gene expression. Future studies are required to dissect the importin-a3 promotor for transcription factor binding sites other than NF-kB.",

Importin-a3 protein levels were strongly reduced in human-type HPAIV compared to avian-type HPAIVinfected MEFs ( Figures 3B-3E ). In contrast, protein expression levels of other importin-a isoforms (a1, a4, a5, and a7) were not affected ( Figures 3F and 3G ). Next, we wanted to assess whether replication of avian-and human-type HPAIV is affected in cells deficient in importin-a3. Cells deficient in importin-a3 were obtained from fibroblasts of mice generated for this study with a deleted importin-a3 gene (a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 ; a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs; Figures  S2D and S2E ). MEFs with a deficient importin-a7 gene were obtained from mice with a deleted importin-a7 gene (a7 \u00c0/\u00c0 ), described previously (Gabriel et al., 2011) . Replication kinetics in MEFs revealed that avian-type but not human-type HPAIV replication is impaired in cells with a deleted importin-a3 gene (a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 ), unlike in control cells, with a deleted importin-a7 gene (a7 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) that acts as a positive factor of human-type HPAIV replication in mammalian cells (Hudjetz and Gabriel, 2012) ( Figures  3H and 3I ). Interestingly, avian-type HPAIV replication in a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs is increased by >1,000 times compared to WT control cells. Human-type HPAIV replication was comparable between WT and a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells ( Figures 3J and 3K ). In line, human-type SC35M-PB2 701N HPAIV replication was not affected in human H1299 a3 +/+ cells upon TNF-a treatment, likely due to the strong inhibition of importin-a3 protein expression ( Figure 3L ). In human H1299 a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells, SC35M-PB2 701N HPAIV replication slightly increased, suggesting some residual inhibitory activity of importin-a3 in human cells ( Figure 3L ). These findings show that low-level TNF-a-inducing HPAIVs with avian-type polymerase signatures are highly sensitive to importin-a3-mediated virus restriction. In contrast, high-level TNF-a-inducing HPAIVs with human-type polymerase genes are resistant to importin-a3mediated virus restriction.",

            "text": "Importin-a3 Belongs to the Most Conserved Nuclear Transport Factors between Avian and Mammalian Species Differential regulation of importin-a3 expression levels upon avian-and human-type HPAIV infections prompted us to analyze the sequence identity of importin-a isoforms in various avian and mammalian species. Among all importin-a isoforms analyzed, importin-a1 was the most diverse nuclear import factor, with amino acid homology of 83.52% between chicken and humans ( Figure 4A ; Table S1 ). The isoforms importin-a3 and importin-a4 displayed the highest amino acid homologies between chicken and humans of 99.04% and 98.08%, respec-tively (Figures 4B and 4C; Table S1 ). Importin-a5, -a6, and -a7 presented amino acid homologies between chicken and humans of 95.91%, 94.22%, and 94.4%, respectively (Figures 4D-4F; Table S1 ). These findings suggest that particularly importin-a3 and importin-a4, both known nuclear transporters of NF-kB (Fagerlund et al., 2005) , are highly conserved across species kingdoms. However, importin-a3 is expressed up t\u00f5 5-times-higher levels than importin-a4 in the murine and human lung ( Figures 1C and 1D) , highlighting particularly the importance of importin-a3 in respiratory immune responses. Thus, acquiring the ability to downregulate importin-a3 in the lung might serve as an important basis in avianmammalian virus transmission. In order to see whether differential importin-a3 regulation is also present in human isolates, we analyzed human-type HPAIV strains that caused poultry outbreaks with human infections in the Netherlands (H7N7) or Thailand (H5N1). Infection of primary lung cultures with cytokine storm, including TNF-a-inducing H5N1 and H7N7 HPAIV isolates with human-type polymerase signatures (PB2 627K ; PB2 701N ), showed significantly reduced importin-a3 expression levels compared to their counterparts with aviantype polymerase signatures (PB2 627E ; PB2 701D ) ( Figures 4G  and 4H ). These findings highlight the crucial role of importin-a3 as a respiratory factor conserved across animal kingdoms in HPAIV interspecies transmission.",

Therefore, we assessed importin-a3 expression levels in lung samples of HPAIV-infected WT mice. Infection with avian-type SC35-PB2 701D led to increased importin-a3 mRNA levels in the lung compared to uninfected controls on day 3 post infection (p.i.) (Figures 5A and 5B) . In contrast, infection with humantype SC35M-PB2 701N resulted in significantly reduced importin-a3 mRNA levels ( Figure 5C ). Since the human-type SC35M HPAIV contains mainly two host adaptive signatures (PB2 701N and NP 319K), we analyzed recombinant viruses with these single mutations to dissect their individual impact on the dysregulation of importin-a mRNA transcription. Herein, the PB2 D701N host adaptive mutation was predominantly responsible for reduced importin-a3 transcription, while its effect was further enhanced when combined with the NP N319K host (F and G) Additionally, importin-a1, -a4, -a5, and -a7 and viral NP protein were detected and quantified with GAPDH adjustment to confirm that observed effects were specific for importin-a3.

Herein, genes controlled by an NF-kB promoter were particularly prominent, with 34% of all analyzed genes (27 out of 79 hits) (Figure 6B) . Moreover, literature analysis of the hits highlighted that especially genes involved in TNF pathways were of high abundance, supporting the in vitro findings (data not shown). TNF-a mRNA levels were increased in the lungs of human-type HPAIV-infected a3 +/+ mice when compared to lungs of aviantype HPAIV-infected animals ( Figure 6C ). As expected, TNF-a protein expression, which is also regulated by NF-kB, was reduced in a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice infected with both avian-and humantype HPAIV ( Figure 6D ). We then assessed a subset of antiviral genes under an NF-kB promoter that showed reduced expression in a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, such as TNFSF-10, IFN-b1, IRF-2, MX-1, IFN-g, EIF2AK2 (alias PKR), IRF-3, MAVS, and IFNA-14. While none of these genes showed significant alterations in PBStreated control mice irrespective of the presence or absence of the importin-a3 gene ( Figure 6E ), the transcription, most prominently of IRF-2 and MX-1 genes involved in major antiviral pathways, was most significantly reduced in SC35M-PB2 701N HPAIV-infected a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice compared to a3 +/+ mice ( Figure 6F ). Infection of a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with both SC35-PB2 701D and SC35M-PB2 701N resulted in enhanced weight loss and lethality compared to a3 +/+ mice ( Figures 6G, 6H , and S5). Virulence was significantly increased in human-type HPAIV-infected a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Table S4 ). These data show that importin-a3 is required for the efficient expression of antiviral genes under the control of an NF-kB promoter.

Here, we shed light on the anatomic distribution of importin-a isoforms in the mammalian lung. We provide evidence of the highly abundant expression of importin-a3 in the murine and human RT. Moreover, importin-a isoforms are expressed as a gradient, with increasing concentrations from the URT to the LRT. Abundant and exclusive high-level expression of importin-a3 was a hallmark of the lung, unlike in other solid organs assessed, such as the liver, spleen, and brain. Knowledge on the importin-a expression pattern in the lung is important to understand the molecular basis of cellular homeostasis that might be dominated by importin-a3-transported transcription factors.",

The high substrate specificity is reflected by only a few cargo proteins reported to be transported into the nucleus by importin-a3. Importin-a3 seems to exclusively serve as a trans-porter of p53, a transcription factor involved in many cancer pathways (Marchenko et al., 2010) . Importin-a3 is also a key factor in the transport of the NF-kB subunits p50 and p65 into the nucleus along with importin-a4, which is the closest relative of importin-a3 (Fagerlund et al., 2005) . Mutations in ARM3 of the importin-a3 protein were shown to be crucial for p50 binding, while mutations in ARM 7 and 8 were shown to be required for p65 binding (Fagerlund et al., 2005) . Based on the crystal structure of importin-a3, it was further postulated that it might pose a ''fast track'' nuclear import pathway under certain circumstances, such as environmental stress (e.g., viral infections), where cellular amounts of importin-b1 may be limited, requiring fast counteraction (Pumroy et al., 2015) . This hypothesis is in line with our findings in this study suggesting that importin-a3 serves as a defense mechanism against influenza by promoting the nuclear entry of NF-kB, which controls the transcription of many antiviral genes.",

            "text": "We further show that importin-a3 gene expression is highly dynamic under inflammatory conditions. We identified an NF-kB binding site within the importin-a3 promoter element and show that its transcription is dependent on TNF-a-activated NF-kB in a concentration-dependent manner. HPAIVs that induce lowlevel TNF-a expression, such as those with avian-type polymerase signatures (PB2 627E and 701D), increase importin-a3 mRNA expression presumably by NF-kB induction. In contrast, high-level TNF-a expression inducing HPAIV, such as those harboring human-type polymerase signatures (PB2 627K and 701N), significantly reduces importin-a3 mRNA expression levels by a yet-unknown mechanism. One possibility would be that high numbers of NF-kB proteins may block the promoter of the importin-a3 gene and thereby its transcription. Other possible interferences could be with NF-kB-activating complexes, such as NEMO or its repressor, IkBa. Future studies are required to unravel the detailed mechanism underlying the failure of importin-a3 promoter activation. Such diverse feedback loops are known in cellular processes, where gene transcription depends on demand. Herein, generating a bottleneck in importin-a3 availability leads to failure in inducing an adequate antiviral immune response, as shown in mice lacking the importin-a3 gene. Interestingly, more than 30% of the differentially expressed genes between a3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and their a3 +/+ litter mates were under the control of an NF-kB promoter, highlighting the significant contribution of importin-a3 in NF-kB-mediated gene transcription. We could further show, using HPAIV strains of the H5N1 and H7N7 subtypes that have caused pneumonia and death in humans, that downregulation of importin-a3 mRNA transcription was a hallmark that was mediated by their human-type polymerase signatures. The introduction of aviantype polymerase signatures into the genetic backbone of these HPAIV outbreak strains restored importin-a3 mRNA transcription in the lung. It is important to note that these human-type HPAIVs induce a general cytokine storm, including TNF-a. Thus, more detailed studies are required to understand the impact of other cytokines on the transcription level of importin-a3. However, a pulmonary increase in TNF-a levels with a concomitant increase in virulence has been described for many human H5N1 and H7N7 isolates containing human-type (PB2 627K ) signatures (Abdel-Ghafar et al., 2008; de Jong et al., 2006; Hatta et al., 2001; Peiris et al., 2007; Szretter et al., 2007) . Based on these findings, we propose that human-type HPAIVs have evolved mechanisms within the mammalian host to evade antiviral response pathways by high-level induction of TNFa-activated NF-kB, which blocks the transcription of importin-a3, the major classical nuclear import protein expressed in the mammalian lung.",

Upon zoonotic transmission of HPAIV from birds to humans, they switch from importin-a3 to importin-a7 usage. While importin-a3 acts as an inhibitor of influenza virus polymerase, importin-a7 acts as a positive factor of influenza virus replication. Importin-a7 is believed to act in a transport-independent function by a yet-unknown mechanism. Until now, it was unclear how importin-a3 mediates antiviral activity. To unravel the mechanism underlying the importin-a3-mediated inhibition, the generation of cell culture models as well as of a murine model with a deleted importin-a3 gene was essential. Our previous observation that replication of HPAIVs with avian-type polymerases, unlike HPAIV with human-type polymerases, was restricted in cells silenced using importin-a3 siRNA and is likely due to residual importin-a3 expression sufficient to induce nuclear import of NF-kB and thus the transcription of various antiviral genes. Furthermore, our findings here support the concept that avian influenza viruses evade importin-a3 restriction by blocking its transcription. As a consequence, influenza viruses get access to the second-most abundant isoform in the lung, importin-a7, to ensure high-replicative fitness in the human lung (Gabriel et al., 2011) .",

After homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells, exon 1 bearing the translational start site for the importin-a3 protein, was deleted. ES cells were electroporated with the linearized construct and clones were picked after double selection with neomycin and gancyclovir. Positive clones were identified by PCR and one of them was chosen for blastocyst injection. From the injected ES cell clone, germline chimeras were obtained and bred with C57BL/6 mice. Importin-a3 deficient mice were backcrossed for eight generations to the C57BL/6 genetic background; the colony was maintained by breeding heterozygous mice. For genotyping, the following primers were used for PCR on genomic DNA of tail or ear biopsies: Impa3for 5'-CCCTCAGTGTGAATTACTTCC-3'; Impa3rev 5'-GAGTC CAAAGCCACTTCGAG-3'; Impa4neorev 5'-GCCCAGTCATAGCCGAATAG-3'. To confirm the gene deletion, absence of importin-a3 mRNA and protein was determined by RT-PCR and western blot of organs. Absence of importin-a3 mRNA with b-Actin as reference was verified using the following primers: Impa3Ex1_for 5 0 -GACAACGAGAAATTGGACAACC-3 0 ; Impa3Ex7_rev 5 0 -CGTTCCAGATGCAATGTTTGTC-3 0 ; beta-actin_for 5 0 -TACAATGAGCTGCGTGTG-3 0 ; beta-Actin_rev 5 0 -CACAGCCTGGATGGC TAC-3 0 . Wild-type (WT) and importin-a \u00c0/\u00c0 murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from murine embryos harvested on embryonic day 13.5 from pregnant females.

Statistical significance of animal survival rates was determined with GraphPad Prism 5 v.5.03 (Graphpad Software, Inc.) using the Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) test and the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. All other mean values, standard deviations (SD), and P values were calculated with GraphPad Prism 5 (v5.03) or the GraphPad Software, Inc. tool (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ ttest1/?Format=SD) using the unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test or the one-sample, two-tailed Student's t test when all values in one group were identical, e.g., set 100%. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05 (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).",

RT-qPCR data were obtained using either human or mouse specific importin-\u03b1 primers. Relative expression values of importin-\u03b11 were set 1 after normalization against GAPDH. Each data point represents an individual sample. (I-K) Importin-\u03b1 protein amounts in murine spleen and liver. Western blot analyses using importin-\u03b1 isoform specific antibodies and GAPDH adjustment were performed to determine endogenous importin-\u03b1 protein amounts (\u03b11, \u03b13, \u03b15, \u03b17) in murine organs (I). For relative quantification in spleen (J) and liver (K), standard curves of affinity-purified, FLAG-tagged importin-\u03b1 proteins were used.
