On March 12, 2003, the WHO issued a worldwide alert for SARS (Seto et al. 2003). Within 4 months, 8436 infected cases and 812 deaths were reported in 32 countries (WHO 2003). Indeed, Hong Kong was the second leading endemic area in the world. By July 2003, there were 1755 infected cases and 299 deaths of SARS in Hong Kong (WHO 2003). SARS was also a tragedy for health care professionals. A total of 341 Hong Kong health care workers were infected and six of them died (Hospital Authority 2003).",

These animals may have been the origin of the SARS virus that affects humans. Symptoms of SARS include fever, shortness of breath, cough, muscle aches and malaise. In some individuals these symptoms may progress quickly to extreme shortness of breath and respiratory failure. This may require oxygen treatment with a mechanical ventilator and high\u2010dose steroids. Unlike influenza or some other viral illnesses, there currently are no vaccinations or immunizations available to prevent SARS.",

The public hospital system carried enormous strain as a result of shortage of staff and increased patient load (Parry 2003). Many nurses were deployed to different settings and worked extra hours (Thompson 2003). In the earlier stage of the outbreak, frontline nurses were not supplied with adequate protective clothing (Parry 2003). As a result, a local newspaper launched a campaign to raise fund of HK$3.43 million from the public, enough for only 17 days supply of protective clothing (Parry 2003).",

Nurses in my ward started to grumble in the midst of the SARS outbreak. Negative emotions of fear, worry and guilt emerged and a real threat to physical safety existed. Some nurses practiced self\u2010quarantine for the fear of spreading the disease to family members, and this caused frustration and feeling of isolation. As a nurse manager working at the middle management level, I sensed the tension and urgency to handle the staff's stress reactions, as Shilling and Brackbill (1987) reported that exposure to occupational stress contributes to employee burnout, acute and chronic health conditions, poor staff morale and reduced job performance. Without proper management of their stress, nurses might give up their role in the so\u2010called \u2018historical battle of SARS\u2019 (Chan & Chan 2003).",

Reflection is usually initiated when uncomfortable feelings and thoughts are sensed in a unique situation (Hancock 1999). The word \u2018reflection\u2019 originates from the Latin verb reflectere that means \u2018bend\u2019 or \u2018turn backwards\u2019 (Hancock 1999). Boyd and Fales (1983) defines reflection as a process of internally examining an issue of concern triggered by an experience, and creating and identifying personal meaning of the experience. The concept of reflective practice has been developed in nursing practice as a vehicle to enable nurses to articulate and learn from their work experience (Hancock 1999). As Schon (1987) argued, professionals are less likely to solve problems by making reference to academic knowledge but are more likely to refer to their own \u2018theories in use\u2019 that are gained from working experience.",

For examples, what is the \u2018here and now\u2019 experience? What was I trying to achieve? What were the consequences of my action? Johns (1994a) suggests that reflection can be a painful experience and a difficult task without expert guidance and support. Through the structured guidance provided by John's model, the practitioner's sense of awareness, reflectiveness, and commitment can be nurtured. This model aims to tune the practitioner's experience into a structured and meaningful one, therefore enabling the reflective practitioner to make sense of and subsequently learn from their experience (Johns 1994a).",

The paper begins with the description of the key stages of the structured reflection process: description of an experience, reflection, and learning (Johns 1994a). Within the stage of reflection, strategies adopted to handle the crisis were guided by Aguilera's (1990) problem\u2010solving model for crisis intervention. Finally, learning from reflection is discussed in terms of ethical, personal and aesthetic arenas (Carper 1978, Johns 1994b)",

Equally important to the cognitive element of reflection is the emotional aspect concerned with the recognition of the practitioner's feeling about the experience when it was happening (Johns 1994a). Due to knowledge deficit and uncertainties about SARS infection, as a nurse manager, I was anxious and I felt further stressed in facing my colleagues\u2019 negative emotions. I was tempted to escape from the role of leader. Conflict arose when I felt shameful for the thought of escaping and at the same time felt angry regarding my innocence and helplessness. On reflection, I rekindled my sense of courage and responsibility to tackle this great challenge, but I was still overwhelmed by a lack of confidence. I was confronted by an imbalance between the difficulty of a problem and my available repertoire of coping skills; a crisis was then precipitated (Aguilera 1990).",

I took an initiative to share my own feelings of fear, anger, stress and helplessness in facing the threats of SARS. Nurses then appeared to feel safe and comfortable in expressing their thoughts and feelings. Individual's emotions and concerns were being acknowledged.

Failure to report the problem of water infiltration to top management would have deprived nurses from their rights for safety needs.

Abstract notions of caring, trust and empathy were exercised through the empowerment of nurses and emotional support to each other. Caring was put into practice by the provision of updated information, provision of PPE and infection control device. The use of silence, touch and the provision of time and space to grieve fostered the establishment of empathy and mutual respect in a nursing team. Furthermore, I gained first\u2010hand experience of the importance of empowerment and team spirit in nursing management. They serve as the most powerful strategies in dealing with the disease, financial constraints, environmental limitations, and emotional distress.

From the dangerous aspects of the SARS outbreak, SARS infection threatens our physical and emotional health. We suffered from emotional distress with fear of infection and death. We lost one nurse infected with SARS and subsequently another five health care professionals died. From a positive perspective, such a crisis created an opportunity for me to learn and grow. We got the opportunity for better understanding of our values, responsibilities, and personal strengths and weaknesses. Through the process of reflective practice, I acquired practical experiences of the essential qualities and duties of a nurse leader \u2013 courage, empowerment, and team building. Team spirit, mutual support, and empathy among nurses are precious experiences for the whole team. These are the most treasured harvests that can go beyond the fear of SARS infection.",
