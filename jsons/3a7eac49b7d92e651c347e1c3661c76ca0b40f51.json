Despite the exciting efficacy observed in preclinical studies, DNA vaccines have faced challenges in inducing strong immune responses in humans. This unexpected poor immunogenicity has severely hampered the translation of DNA vaccines from investigational medications to licensed products. To overcome this obstacle, tremendous efforts have been made to improve antigen expression and enhance immunogenicity. Among these endeavors, in vivo DNA electroporation (EP) has proved to be a breakthrough technology capable of mediating efficient DNA uptake and resulting in enhanced antigen expression and vaccine immunogenicity. EP-mediated DNA delivery has become one of the major platforms used in clinical trials to evaluate DNA vaccines in humans. In this chapter, in addition to EP delivery, other progress made in DNA vaccine development including plasmid optimization, antigen design, and immunologic adjuvants is also reviewed. Finally, the use of DNA vaccines in the context of clinical trials for infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy is summarized. Specifically, the strategies that allow DNA vaccines to overcome antigenic diversity for viral infection and break immune tolerance for cancer therapy are explored. Based on the advantages of DNA vaccines and the immense progress, led by the electroporation-mediated vaccine delivery, DNA vaccines appear to have the potential to fundamentally transform the vaccine field, providing important benefits for preventing and curing diseases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In 1990, Wolff and colleagues first demonstrated that long-term gene expression could be achieved simply by direct injection of plasmid DNA into mouse skeletal muscle (Wolff et al. 1990 ).

Importantly, the inoculated mice developed anti-hGH antibodies, suggesting the immunological use of DNA (Tang et al. 1992) .

Upon administration of the plasmid DNA, the in vivo expressed antigen can stimulate the host immune system to elicit a response. As a third generation platform, DNA vaccination has distinct advantages over other vaccine approaches. DNA vaccines can induce both humoral and cellular immune responses making them distinct from conventional inactivated vaccines and subunit vaccines. In addition, plasmid DNA has a number of unmethylated CpG motifs, due to its bacterial origin, that are capable of stimulating innate immune responses via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). The ability to activate all arms of the immune system (B cells, T H cells, and cytotoxic T cells) means the DNA vaccine platform has the potential for not only prophylactic but also therapeutic applications. Unlike the traditional prophylactic vaccines that prevent infections from occurring, therapeutic DNA vaccines can be used as an immunotherapy to treat chronic viral infections and cancers by direct killing of latently infected cells and mutated tumor cells. DNA vaccines have also been shown to have a benign safety profile. The injected plasmid only encodes a selected gene from a pathogen, eliminating risk of pathogenic infection or reversion to virulence, a safety concern that is associated with live attenuated vaccines. Importantly, as plasmid DNA vaccines are noninfectious, the elicited immune responses are solely specific to the antigen encoded by the transgene rather than to the plasmid itself. As a result, no anti-DNA vector responses have been observed, thereby allowing for repeated vaccine administration without weakening the specific immune response. This feature is critical for the prime and boost regimen, a commonly used approach for enhancing vaccine immunogenicity. Another advantage that makes DNA vaccines a competitive option is its ease of design and manufacture. The advancement of gene synthesis and recombinant DNA technology allows for flexible and rapid alterations of the expressed immunogen. Large-scale production of plasmids can be completed within a short period of time, making DNA vaccines particularly suitable for responding to pandemic outbreaks. Finally, DNA vaccines are more stable and resistant to temperature extremes than other vaccine forms which are of great benefit for storage, transport, and distribution especially in resource-limited regions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Despite all the positive characteristics and the superb efficacy observed in preclinical studies, DNA vaccines have been slow to demonstrate similar success in humans. The unforeseen poor immunogenicity observed in most early clinical trials was disappointing and poses a formidable challenge for DNA vaccine licensure.

The first one, developed by Fort Dodge laboratories against West Nile virus infection in horses was approved by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2005. A second DNA vaccine (Apex-IHN, Novartis Animal Health) was licensed in Canada for prevention of hematopoietic necrosis virus infection in farmed salmon and trout.

The success of this vaccine supported the concept of using a xenogeneic protein to break central immune tolerance for cancer vaccine development (Liu 2011) . Additional insight gained from the success of DNA vaccines in veterinary practice is that the DNA scaling-up might not be a potential hindrance for DNA vaccine being effective in humans. It has been extrapolated that an impractically high dose of DNA vaccine would be required for use in human subjects in order to reproduce the vaccine efficacy obtained in mice (Tregoning and Kinnear 2014) .

In order to prime a cellular response, the intracellularly produced antigens must be released into extracellular matrix either by secretion or by cell lysis. The released antigens are then engulfed by APCs and loaded onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules leading to activation of CD8 + T cell. This uptake mechanism is different from that which occurs with exogenous proteins and is thus termed as cross-priming (Liu 2011) . DNA plasmids can also directly transfect APCs that have migrated to the injection site. After being expressed in APCs, the antigens are cleaved to peptides and uploaded onto MHC I or II molecules, leading to activation of both CD8 + CTLs and CD4 + T H cells.

The CpG motifs bind to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a transmembrane protein found on a number of immune cells including dendritic cells (DC), B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Activation of TLR9 leads to a cascade of pro-inflammatory responses and results in the production of various cytokines including type I interferon (IFN), Interleukin (IL)-12, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1).

The selection of the appropriate delivery method is dependent on multiple factors including optimum expression, immunogenicity, feasibility, and tolerability. Among the considered delivery approaches, intramuscular (i.m.) injection is the principal route of choice for DNA vaccination due to the fact that skeletal muscle is readily accessible and highly effective in taking up DNA. Furthermore, myocytes are energy rich and postmitotic cells capable of sustaining long-term transgene expression for eliciting durable immunity (Aurisicchio et al. 2013; Tregoning and Kinnear 2014) . In addition to i.m. injection, intradermal (i.d.) delivery is also considered to be an effective pathway for vaccination not only because of its greater ease of accessibility but also the prominent presence of large amount of immune cells in the dermis including dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and migrating lymphocytes. Both i.m. and i.d. are two major administration routes used in preclinical studies and clinical trials for DNA delivery. Some studies suggested that the nature of the immune response could be driven by the vaccine administration route. For example, due to the enrichment of antigen presenting cells in skin, the i.d. route is believed to preferentially induce cellular immune responses as a result of direct transfection of APCs. On the other hand, i.m. injection equally induces both humoral and cellular immunity via direct transfection and by the crosspriming mechanism. However, in a recent clinical trial where an HIV-specific DNA vaccine was delivered via either an i.m., or i.d. route, no differences in induced immune responses were observed (Enama et al. 2014 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 172, "text": "(Liu 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 173, "end": 200, "text": "Tregoning and Kinnear 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 796, "end": 821, "text": "(Aurisicchio et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 822, "end": 849, "text": "Tregoning and Kinnear 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1927, "end": 1945, "text": "(Enama et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Route of Administration"}, {"text": "After administration, the plasmid DNA must successfully overcome a series of barriers before mounting the desired immune response.

However, the efficiency of intracellular movement is very low, with less than 0.1% of plasmid DNA that enters the cytosol is eventually transcribed (Tregoning and Kinnear 2014) . Moreover, prior to arrival at the nucleus, DNA in the cytosol is subject to degradation by nuclease digestion. Finally, during the process of protein synthesis, mRNA translation efficiency can also be modulated by factors such as the presence of a Kozak sequence and codon usage.

The cell membrane is permeabilized for only a short period of time and rapidly closes after electrical treatment terminates, returning the cell to its original state. EP has been proven to be a very powerful technology, resulting in 100-1000-fold increases in plasmid uptake and subsequent antigen expression compared to naked DNA vaccines (Aurisicchio et al. 2013 ). Furthermore, EP has the additional benefit of causing tissue damage that can lead to local inflammation and release of cytokines (Fioretti et al. 2010) . This adjuvant effect of EP consequently promotes the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses, potentiating the immunogenicity of the delivered DNA. The EP technology has been safe and well tolerated (Bagarazzi et al. 2012) with the most common minor side effects observed in clinical trials being local injection-site pain and discomfort associated with short muscle contraction triggered by electric pulses. It is believed that EP represents the most promising technology in DNA delivery (Aurisicchio et al. 2013) . Recently, the application of i.m. injection followed by EP delivery has become one of the major platforms used in clinical trials to evaluate DNA vaccines in humans. However, it should be noted that EP technology has intrinsic limitations. The EP approach requires penetration with several sharp needle-like electrodes into the subject's body followed by introduction of transient electric pulses.

Therefore, optimizing antigen expression is key to improving vaccine performance. Plasmid codon optimization is one such approach to augment expression. It refers to changing the antigen coding sequence, via synonymous substitutions, from the wild type to a selected sequence that has the most abundant tRNAs in the cytosol of transfected cells. Through codon optimization, adverse rare codons are avoided and secondary structures in the mRNA are minimized, therefore, protein expression can be increased severalfold. In addition to codon optimization, various manipulations of the DNA sequence can be performed to modulate antigen intracellular processing and immune response priming. For example, adding nuclear localization signals to the plasmid helps direct DNA to the nucleus for transcription. For the purpose of introducing cellular immunity, ubiquitin coding sequence can be incorporated in the DNA vaccine to enhance protein degradation and antigen peptide production in the proteasome (Leifert et al. 2004 ). If humoral immunity is desired, the antigen coding region can be modified by adding a leader sequence capable of guiding the expressed antigen so that it undergoes proper folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), export through the secretory pathway, and release into extracellular matrix for further presentation to B lymphocytes and APCs (Fioretti et al. 2010 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 119, "text": "(Tregoning and Kinnear 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1138, "text": "(Leifert et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1504, "text": "(Fioretti et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Optimization of Plasmid Design"}, {"text": "Due to its bacterial origin, plasmid DNA carries a naturally occurring adjuvant.

To avoid this timing issue, genetic adjuvants have been investigated to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. Genetic adjuvants refer to immunoregulatory cytokines and proteins encoded by additional plasmids. The most commonly used genetic adjuvants include IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-I), CD86, and Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) (Fioretti et al. 2010; Tregoning and Kinnear 2014) .

The inactivated or attenuated virus in the vaccine promotes an immune response that can prevent infection from identical or very similar viruses. However, due to antigenic diversity, the annually recommended flu vaccine can become ineffective if new strains emerge. In order to avoid frequent composition adjustment for emerging influenza strains, new vaccine platforms capable of inducing a universal immune response against a broad spectrum of influenza strains are greatly needed. Viral surface proteins are the primary targets for prophylactic vaccine development, because of their crucial role in initiation of infection and their prominent display on the virion surface. However, due to host immune pressure, these surface proteins are constantly evolving and have high degrees of variability, making it difficult to develop a universal vaccine. Thanks to the versatility and ease of rapid alteration of the expressed immunogen, a DNA vaccine strategy has great potential in overcoming influenza antigenic diversity. For example, a novel synthetic consensus sequence technology has been developed to broaden the effectiveness of the vaccine to cover variant strains of influenza displaying antigenically altered hemagglutinin (HA). Specifically, using the combination of extensive genetic data and a computer algorithm, the gene sequences encoding the HA protein of a large number of circulating influenza strains were analyzed. Subsequently, a new arrangement of the DNA sequence is created resulting in an average gene sequence for the HA protein. The synthetic consensus DNA sequence is substantially similar to but different from those encoded by naturally occurring circulating variants.

However, neither of them can be included in HIV vaccines due to the safety concerns that attenuated HIV would cause AIDS and one cannot be certain that all virus particles would be completely inactivated. To date, only two subunit vaccines, namely, the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) vaccine and the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are approved for clinical use. However, similar success has not been reproduced for other viral diseases including HIV infection. It was noted that the HBV recombinant protein is different from many other viral recombinant proteins in regards to its ability to form particles, a feature that may render HBV recombinant protein super immunogenic (Liu 2011) . Nevertheless, the field remains far less experienced with the recombinant subunit vaccine approach.

The immunization resulted in detectable but transient-specific cytotoxicity in eight of nine patients immunized (Calarota et al. 1998 ). Since then, clinical studies using improved formulation and delivery strategies have been conducted. In several phase I trials, in an effort to improve the immunogenicity, additional plasmids encoding IL12 or IL15 were given together with DNA vaccine encoding HIV env, gag, and pol proteins. The inclusion of these molecular adjuvants led to an increase in magnitude and breath of cellular and humoral immunity (Felber et al. 2014) . Recently, several vaccines using DNA as a prime in combination with different boosts have also been evaluated. The boosts used in these trials were either viral vectors (recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara (rMVA), recombinant adenovirus (rAde), or recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis virus (rVSV))expressing env or in the form of a purified recombinant gp120 protein (Felber et al. 2014 ). The rationale of using a DNA prime and protein boost approach is based on the observations that DNA vaccination is suited to eliciting strong cellular immunity, whereas protein immunization preferentially induces antibody response (Felber et al. 2014) . From 2003 to 2006, a large-scale efficacy trial carried out in Thailand (RV144 trial) used a similar prime-boost schedule, in which the priming DNA (HIV env, gag, and pro gene) was introduced by a canarypox vector rather than by a naked DNA vaccine. Although the DNA uptake efficiency mediated by viral vectors could be higher than naked DNA, one potential disadvantage of using viral vector is that the preexisting anti-vector immunity may dampen the effectiveness of the priming immunization, an issue that can be perceived from the failed STEP (also referred to as Merck V520-023) trial. Nonetheless, until now the RV144 trial is the only one to demonstrate a transient and modest protection benefit. Notably, the limited protection appeared to be correlated with the humoral responses.

Ideally, xenoantigens should be sufficiently different from self-antigens in order to be immunogenic; they must, on the other hand, also preserve an optimal homology range with self-proteins to secure the cross-reactivity of the induced immune responses.

This vaccine consists of DNA encoding a human version of tyrosinase, which enabled the dog's immune system to break tolerance to the dog tyrosinase and mount an effective response. The concept of using xenoantigens to enhance vaccine immunogenicity is also supported by a recent preclinical study in which mice immunized with human p53 (hp53) DNA vaccine protected against challenge with murine colon cancer MC38 while those immunized with mouse p53 (mp53 DNA) were not (Soong et al. 2013) . In a therapeutic model, established MC38 tumors were also well controlled by treatment with hp53 DNA therapy in tumor bearing mice compared to mp53 DNA.
