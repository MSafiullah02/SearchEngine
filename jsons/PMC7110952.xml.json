Informed consent was obtained from patients 16 years of age or older; patients between the ages of 7 to 15 years provided patient assent while their parent or guardian provided proxy consent. For patients under 7 years of age, parental or guardian consent alone was obtained. Of patients approached, 269 (76.9%) were recruited. Those who refused to participate in the study did not significantly differ from the participants in age and gender. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at The Hospital for Sick Children. In 2003, recruitment was slow due to low ED patient volume after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

Multiple conditional logistic regressions were used to model patient outcomes during follow-up. Specifically, the impact of drug insurance coverage was examined while adjusting for confounders. Because adverse asthma events at 1 month were rare, only patient outcomes at 6 months were examined in the logistic regressions analysis.

For example, Spurrier and colleagues9 followed children with asthma for 6 months after attending an ED and found that 37% had at least 1 unplanned subsequent visit to the ED. In the current study, the incidence of repeat ED visits was 6.1% and 26.8% at 1 and 6 months, respectively. Though still concerning, the rates were lower than those reported by most others. Possible explanations for this difference may lie in the asthma education given to children/family in the ED and the emphasis of the use of inhaled corticosteroids after ED discharge. Our data showed that inhaled corticosteroids were used to some extent\u2014although it may not be consistent with guideline recommendations\u2014in about three fourths of our study population over the study period.

This indicates that the affordability and accessibility of asthma medications may still be major barriers to long-term asthma control in children, even under a public health care system. Recently, the development of better drug benefit plans has been recognized as one of the key challenges, if addressed, that would make the biggest impact on improving access to the medications and education that Canadian children need for optimal asthma control.23 In the United States, a multicenter study found that medical care insurance status had no impact on quality of care and short-term outcomes in children with acute asthma presenting to 36 EDs.10 This suggests that other risk factors such as affordability and accessibility of medications may play a more important role in determining outcomes of children with asthma in privately insured health care systems. Therefore, improving the affordability and accessibility of asthma medications\u2014maybe through public health policies and interventions\u2014should be considered a priority target for future efforts to improve outcomes in children with asthma.",

Similar to previous studies, we found that environment control measures (eg, washing bed linens in hot water weekly) were associated with a significantly lower risk of subsequent acute asthma episodes. Current guidelines endorsed reducing exposure to allergens in asthma patients as the tertiary prevention strategy for asthma.11, 12, 13 Some researchers recommended that clinicians provide education regarding effective environmental measures for all families with potentially modifiable asthma triggers,24 although the optimal location, content, and duration of the delivery of such asthma education remain an ongoing debate.25 Although some have advocated that education for asthma patients should be initiated in the ED, many barriers exist that make it difficult to implement. These include the allocation of adequate staff time for patient education, adjustment of content to meet individual patients' needs, and the assessment of learners' comprehension.26 Our study suggested that providing patient education in the ED may contribute to improved long-term outcomes in children with asthma. Further studies that assess the cost-effectiveness of allocating an asthma educator in the ED would be informative to guide future policy changes and resource allocation.",

Furthermore, in contrast to recommendations in national guidelines, less than half of these children had scheduled visits to health care providers for asthma within 1 month after ED discharge.

However, a recent study showed that agreement between health administrative data and respondent reports was moderate for ED visits in the past year, and the agreement was significantly higher for children who had an asthma attack in the past 6 months.20 In addition, the time windows (4 weeks or 6 months) adopted in our questionnaire were much shorter than those applied in national population-based health surveys (12 months),27, 28 which would help reduce the risk of underreporting as children recovered over time.",
