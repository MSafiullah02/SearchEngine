Their subtle ability to develop strategies to evade the host immune system, along with the high mutation and replication rates, has made viruses plague terrestrial ecosystems since their appearance. Indeed, virus-borne infectious diseases tend to spread abruptly over wide geographical areas, leading to outbreaks that can dramatically affect health, national economies, and the overall well-being of societies. 1 In the past few decades, pharmaceutical and biotechnological advance has succeeded in developing new therapeutics for the management of different viral diseases: for example, anti-retroviral therapy against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or the pan-genotypic direct-acting antiviral drugs used for hepatitis C (HCV) management. Nevertheless, the majority of current therapies are unable to accomplish virus eradication or sustained virological response, therefore the battle against viral pathogens still represents a primary focus of medical research. In addition, the constant onset of new viral pathogens, generally correlated with massive outbreaks, imperils researchers to determine the pathogenic mechanisms of the new viruses, with the ultimate goal to provide new therapeutic approaches in the antiviral field. 2, 3 Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites characterized by great diversity in terms of morphology, size, genome nature, and protein composition. A virus particle, also called a virion, consists of the viral genome, which can be either DNA or RNA in a single-or double-stranded state, surrounded by a protein coat, the capsid. Some virus families additionally present an external lipid bilayer called envelope, derived from cellular membranes (Fig. 1) .",

As a consequence, new virions are assembled in the cell and egress from it to infect other cells, completing their replicative life cycle (Fig. 2) . Some viruses do not always actively replicate while within the host but remain dormant in defined cell types by integrating their genome into the host DNA, or through formation of circular viral genome molecules (episomes). This process is termed viral latency: through it the virus can evade the host immune system, usually establishing a lifelong infection. 4 It is worth noting that each viral class has its own peculiar viral cycle: their details will be described later in this chapter.

The most commonly used system is the Baltimore classification, which allocates viruses into seven different classes, according to the nucleic acid type and the resulting mRNA synthesis mechanism (Table 1) . 5 G-quadruplexes (G4s) have been identified in viruses belonging to almost all groups of the Baltimore classification. Indeed, in the past few years, research on the biological role of G4s in virology has boomed, providing strong evidence of the relationship between G4s and the regulation of key viral steps. A recent comprehensive bioinformatics analysis traced putative G4-forming sequences (PQSs) in all human viruses, showing that their distribution is statistically relevant, making them a distinctive feature of the different virus families. In addition, such PQSs are highly conserved, despite the high recombination rates that characterize viruses, suggesting a crucial role for G4s in viral evolution and replication, and corroborating their targeting as a valid pharmacological approach for antiviral therapy. 6 ",

Among all human herpesviruses (HHVs), nine species routinely infect humans, are extremely widespread and responsible for the onset of several different diseases, such as orolabial and genital herpes, chickenpox and shingles, mononucleosis and different types of cancer (Table 2) . Interestingly, more than 90% of adults are infected with at least one of these. 9 HHVs differ significantly in terms of DNA base composition and sequence arrangement; nonetheless, they share many biological properties, including the ability to sustain, after a primary infection, a latent state through maintenance of their genome in the infected organism as an extrachromosomal nuclear episome. 10 During their life cycle, HHVs trigger an intricate chain of events to achieve replication, which involves both cellular and viral structures. Briefly, after attachment to the host's cell 11 Pharmacological research in the antiherpetic field has been quite successful, since to date, several efficient drugs are available on the market. One of the most efficient antiviral agents is acyclovir, along with its derivatives. These compounds are classified as nucleosides analogues: they block viral replication by being incorporated into the nascent viral DNA. They have been widely employed for the treatment of alpha-HHVs and are still considered the first line drugs of choice in the management of these viruses. However, the excessive use of anti-HHVs agents over large periods, especially in immunocompromised patients, has led to the onset of resistant viral strains. Moreover, considering that HHVs undergo latency, and that, to date, there is no way to eradicate the virus from the host cells, the development of new compounds with innovative targets and mechanisms of action is urgently needed. 11 Genome-wide bioinformatics analysis has revealed remarkable PQS density in all HHV species, mostly in genome regulatory and repeated regions, which are crucial to sustain the episomal form. The enrichment, distribution and conservation rate of these sequences strongly corroborate G4s as functional elements in the regulation of the viral life cycle. 12, 13 In addition, a recent study demonstrated an interesting correlation between G4 sequence composition in HHVs and their hosts, suggesting a possible long-term virus-host co-evolution process. 14 Consequently, G4s may represent efficient pharmacological targets, alternative to those aimed at by the current anti-herpetic therapies.",

The majority of the sequences have been demonstrated to actually fold into G4 structures, and to be stabilized after treatment with two different porphyrinbased G4 ligands, TMPyP4 and NMM. Interestingly, in a luciferase reporter system that included different PQSs in viral promoters, NMM was shown to suppress the expression of several mRNAs and to reduce both intracellular and extracellular viral DNA levels. 20 Recently, the anti-CMV activity of a polymerase inhibitor CX-5461, a known G4 ligand currently in phase I clinical trial, was also demonstrated. Interestingly, the compound induced a 2.0 log reduction in viral titer, together with a significant decrease in the amount of viral DNA and pUL44, the viral processivity factor: these data indicate that the effect of CX-5461 is exerted at the viral DNA replication stage of the viral life cycle.

The HHV-6 genome is characterized by the presence of variable-length telomere-like repeat regions at its termini, which can integrate by homologous recombination into the human chromosome at the telomeres; however, the mechanisms regulating this process remain poorly understood. Considering that telomeres are commonly known to fold into G4s, involvement of these non-canonical arrangements in the regulation of HHV-6 chromosomal integration is plausible. Indeed, treatment of HHV-6 infected telomeraseexpressing cells with the G4 ligand BRACO-19 resulted in a significant reduction in chromosomal integration, likely due to the prevention of telomere end elongation. 22 ",

            "text": "EBV is one the most common human viruses in the world, affecting more than 90% of the world's population. Its primary infection tends to be generally asymptomatic. However it could lead to infectious mononucleosis and, in the worst case, to various types of cancer. Its genome comprises genes encoding for six EBV nuclear proteins that are expressed only in the latent infection and sustain the viral episome maintenance. 23 Studies on the characterization and role of G4s in EBV showed that the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1), the viral protein pivotal to immune evasion, promotes viral DNA replication by interacting with RNA G4s and recruiting the cellular origin replication complex. The EBNA1 mRNA itself is enriched in folded G4s, which behave as cis-acting modulators of viral mRNA translation, producing ribosome dissociation. 24,25 EBNA1 mRNA G4s have also been found to regulate the endogenous presentation of EBNA1-specific CD8 + T-cell epitopes, seen in persistent infections. 26 The employment of G4 ligands has helped the investigation of the functional and biochemical characteristics of EBNA1. BRACO-19, for instance, stabilized the viral RNA G4 and, in infected lymphocytes, reduced EBV genome copy numbers. It also negatively modulated transcription levels of EBNA2 and EBNA3A, and inhibited EBNA1-dependent DNA replication. 24 Another G4 ligand, pyridostatin (PDS), enhanced the stability of the EBV G4s, reducing EBNA1 synthesis level in a concentration-dependent way, both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, EBV-infected cells were found to be less efficiently recognized by virus-specific T cells, although such a mechanism still needs to be elucidated. These data show that G4-mediated inhibition affects processes that are crucial for viral DNA replication, 25 reinforcing the importance of alternative DNA structures in the regulation of virus processes. The cellular protein nucleolin, which has been widely shown to bind G4s, 27 recognizes and also binds viral EBNA1 mRNA G4s. As a consequence it downregulates EBNA1 expression and antigen presentation, counteracting EBV stealthiness. Such interactions can be targeted to modulate EBV progression: indeed the PhenDC3 G4 ligand was found to prevent nucleolin binding to EBNA1 mRNA G4s and to increase the endogenous EBNA1 levels in EBV-infected B cells and in cells derived from a nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 28 Following on from PhenDC3, variously substituted bis(acylhydrazones) derivatives have also been investigated for their ability to interfere with the nucleolin/EBNA1 mRNA G4s interaction. Two compounds, PhenDH2 and PyDH2, have been found to be more active and less toxic with respect to the lead compound. 29 However, it is worth noting that although many of the tested PhenDC3 analogues displayed strong in vitro binding and stabilization of RNA G4s, only a few of them were able to interfere with EBV immune evasion. This result suggested that the ability to hamper nucleolin/EBNA1 interaction might require additional activities, independent from G4 stabilization. Indeed, different G4 ligands can generate opposite effects: this is the case of PDS, which, in contrast to PhenDC3, further suppressed EBNA1 mRNA translation, 25 as also demonstrated by quantitative proximity ligation assay. 30 All these data support the ability of EBNA1 G4s to operate as nucleolin-binding platform. A very recent study reported that they also promote nuclear retention, 31 but the relationship between the two processes needs further investigation. Notably, EBV nuclear antigens are involved in B-cells transformation, especially EBNA1, which is expressed in all EBV-related tumors. 32 Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the nucleolin/EBNA1 G4 complex could be involved in virus-related oncogenesis and it might be exploited as a pharmacological target to impair both virus and tumor progression.",

It mostly concerns AIDS patients, as KSHV seroprevalence is directly proportional to HIV seropositivity rates. At the moment, there are no treatments for the lytic or latent infections. 33 The KSHV genome is arranged in a $ 140 kb long central region, encoding viral genes, flanked by repeated regions (terminal repeats, or TRs), which harbor the viral episome unique origin of replication. TRs are highly enriched in G/C bases and have been demonstrated to form stable G4s, located both in the forward and reverse strands, and involved in the regulation of episomal replication. Stabilization of viral G4s by means of different G4 ligands, PhenDC3 and TMPyP4, stalled the replication fork at the TR level, with consequent replicative stress and inhibition of KSHV DNA replication, which resulted in the dramatic reduction (60%) of viral episome copy numbers. 34 In addition, the KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA1) protein, which is the master regulatory protein of KSHV latency, forms G4 structures in its own mRNA, analogous to EBNA1. G4 stabilization induced by TMPyP4 treatment downregulated LANA1 translation, with consequent reduction of protein expression in KSHV infected cells, suggesting that LANA1 mRNA G4s are involved in the regulation of the translation machinery. Interestingly, reduced translation has been found to be strictly related to reduction of antigen presentation, one of the main mechanisms adopted by LANA1 to promote immune evasion. 35 Altogether, these data confirm that G4s are key regulatory element in the regulation of host-pathogen interaction in the Herpesviridae family and support the feasible exploitation of these structures as innovative pharmacological targets in the antiherpetic therapy.",

Seven of the identified sequences were found to be surprisingly conserved within more than 50 analyzed flavivirus genomes. Given the great viral genome variability, this observation suggests a significant involvement of these PQS in the regulation of the life cycle of these viruses.

The one located in the core gene was characterized as the most stable G4. 48 Its stabilization with the G4 ligands TMPyP4 and a PDS derivative (PDP) promoted viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase stalling, with consequent reduction in HCV core protein levels. In vivo analysis revealed that PDP led to G4-mediated antiviral activity in the low micromolar range, by inhibiting intracellular replication of different HCV genotypes. 49 A deeper investigation also showed that the HCV core RNA G4 is recognized and bound by the cellular protein nucleolin. This interaction, which has been found to be structure-related, resulted in inhibition of HCV replication in cells. Such activity was counteracted by the employment of G4 ligands such as PDS and PDP, which competed for the same binding site. TMPyP4 did not produce the same effect, however, this last compound is in general less selective for G4s. 50 Moreover, HCV infection promoted nucleolin overexpression, which in turn induced a drastic reduction of HCV total RNA levels. Conversely, nucleolin silencing was directly correlated with increased HCV RNA expression. 48 These results strongly suggest the existence of a host anti-viral immunity mechanism involving G4 structures. Additional bioinformatic studies based on a different algorithm showed the presence of a very interesting G4-forming sequence in the stem-loop IIy of the HCV negative strand, precisely in the 3'-UTR, which is the initiation site for the (+)-strand replication. The G4 sequence, highly conserved in many different HCV strains, was strongly stabilized by the bisquinolinium derivative PhenDC3 and as a consequence, RNA synthesis was hampered by more than 70%. Moreover, in a luciferase system in which luciferase expression was directly related to viral replication, 60% reduction was observed upon treatment with the compound. 51 HCV was also used as the reference RNA virus to develop a fluorescence light-up probe, a thioflavine T derivative (ThT-NE), for the direct visualization of the native HCV RNA genome in living cells. ThT-NE showed remarkable specificity for HCV RNA G4s with respect to other G4s in different cell models, probably because during infections viral G4s outnumber cellular G4s in order to maximize viral replication. Moreover, the HCV replication machinery promotes formation of vesicle-like viral replication complexes that contain most of the newly synthesized viral RNA, generating a localized G4 enrichment that improves ThT-NE recognition. 52 If this strategy were applicable also to other pathogens, it would represent a striking turning point in pathological research and clinical diagnosis.",

The virus is one of the most pathogenic viruses in humans and it is highly contagious. Furthermore, no effective drugs are available against it. SARS-CoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family and has a (+)-ssRNA genome of 29.7 kb in length, encoding for 13 viral genes. The nonstructural protein 3, also known as SARS unique domain (SUD), plays a crucial role in viral replication and transcription. It was demonstrated to preferentially bind G4-forming oligonucleotides that form in the 3 0 -UTR of mRNAs coding for host-cell proteins implicated in the regulation of several processes, such as apoptosis and signal transduction. For this reason, the SUD/G4 interaction has been speculated to be involved in the modulation of genome replication and host cell response to viral infection. 55, 56 In December 2019, a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 was identified in Wuhan, China; it causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) , which in a minority of people progresses to severe atypical pneumonia that requires hospitalization and has extremely high mortality among the elderly and immunocompromised people. 57 SARS-CoV-2, being highly contagious, caused a pandemic in the early months of 2020. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 86% genome homology: they both infect humans by entering the lower respiratory tract through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 58 However, an amino acid composition difference of about 25% was found between the SUD of the two viruses, 59 therefore further characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 SUD will be necessary to assess its function and possible interaction with G4 nucleic acids.",

Retroviruses are classified into two subfamilies: Orthoretrovirinae, including alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-retroviruses and lentiviruses; Spumavirinae, represented by the genus spumavirus. They possess two copies of (+)-ssRNA genome, formed by four coding genes, gag, pro, pol and env, several genes encoding for accessory proteins and two flanking repeat segments followed by untranslated regions. The pol gene encodes for the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme, the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that allows synthesis of viral DNA from the genomic RNA. The newly formed dsDNA, which presents two identical long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both ends, once integrated into the host's chromosomal DNA forms the provirus. The provirus is transcribed and translated to form new virions, or it may remain dormant, i.e., latent: in both cases, it can be no longer eliminated from the host. The LTR located at the 5 0 -end represents the control center for viral gene expression. It is organized in three sections, U3, R, and U5. The U3 region includes binding sites for transcription factors and acts as the unique promoter for retroviral transcription. 60 Interestingly, highly conserved PQSs have been found in the majority of retrovirus subfamilies, mainly located in the LTRs. Biophysics assays have demonstrated the actual ability of these sequences to fold into G4s, which were strongly stabilized by G4 ligands, such as BRACO-19 and a coreextended NDI, supporting the possibility of targeting the LTR G4s as innovative antiretroviral therapy. 61,62",

            "text": "Regarding the provirus, the LTR U3 promoter sequence is highly enriched in guanines, especially at the Sp1 and NF-\u03baB binding sites. 70 In this region, three overlapping G4 structures can form: LTR-II and LTR-III that are constitutively formed, and LTR-IV, the folding of which is induced by proteins or ligands binding. 71 LTR-III and LTR-IV structures, which have been characterized through NMR spectroscopy, showed very peculiar features. LTR-III G4 folds into a hybrid, three-layered quadruplex, with a conserved duplex stem-loop in the central loop. 72 LTR-IV G4 has a parallel topology with a bulged G-tract at its 3 0 -end. 73 Such distinctive structures could be exploited to design specific ligands able to selectively target HIV-1 LTR G4s, overcoming the low selectivity that characterizes currently available G4 ligands. The two LTR G4s are mutually exclusive and induce opposite effects on the LTR promoter activity. LTR-III G4 stabilization inhibits viral transcription, 71 while LTR-IV G4 hampers this activity. 73 The folding/unfolding of this region is controlled by at least two cellular proteins: nucleolin, which greatly stabilizes the LTR G4s, with a consequent overall silencing effect, 74 and the human ribonucleoprotein A2B1, which in turn unwinds the G4s to promote transcription. 75 These data infer that the fine balance between G4s might be one of the regulatory mechanisms in the regulation of HIV-1 promoter activity. Moreover, it has been very recently shown that the LTR transcription machinery also involves another alternative structure, the i-motif, 76 which can form in the provirus negative strand, further supporting the regulatory role of non-canonical nucleic acids structures in virus biology. 77 Several G4 ligands have been tested to assess the effect on HIV-1 G4s on the viral promoter and promising stabilizing activity was observed, leading to an overall antiviral effect. BRACO-19 significantly stabilized the naturally occurring G4s, LTR-II and LTR-III, and induced folding of LTR-IV. Upon treatment with increasing compound concentrations, LTR promoter activity was reduced by almost 70% when compared to the untreated condition: a mutated non-G4 sequence used as control showed no variation in promoter response and thus confirmed the effect to be G4-related. 71 BRACO-19 was then tested in various cell lines, using different HIV-1 strains. It exerted promising G4-mediated antiviral activity, in the micromolar range. Considering that the G4 ligand also stabilizes HIV-1 RNA G4s, the antiviral effect could be ascribed to a dual mechanism of action, both at the pre-and the post-integration level. 66 The development of a new series of core-extended NDI derivatives has significantly improved the anti-HIV-1 activity of the G4 ligands. In fact, these molecules, characterized by exceptional solubility properties, displayed outstanding in vitro stabilizing activity on HIV-1 LTR G4s, with preference for the viral over the human telomeric G4s, used as a cellular reference. Most importantly, the series exhibited strong antiviral activity in the low nanomolar range (IC 50 < 25 nM). Time-related antiviral assays combined with reporter assays, have confirmed the G4-mediated mechanism of action. 78 Further investigation on G4s in the HIV-1 integrated genome have identified three PQSs in the nef gene. This encodes for the viral accessory protein Nef, a factor involved in the maintenance of a persistent HIV infection in vivo. The nef gene is located at the 3 0 -end of the viral genome, with its coding region that partially overlaps with the 3 0 -LTR. The observed PQSs were highly conserved and able to fold into two-tetrads G4s. Nef G4s were stabilized in vitro by different G4 ligands, such as TMPyP4, BRACO-19 and PIPER. Interestingly, employment of TMPyP4 in the TZM-bl reporter cell line, which supports Nef-dependent HIV-1 replication, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity. 79 Altogether, these data support the possibility of exploiting viral G4s as novel anti-HIV-1 targets, possibly in both the lytic and latent infection.",

The virus establishes a state of latent infection in T cells: at this stage, it is not susceptible to antiretroviral drugs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are complex and not completely understood; nonetheless some forms of latency entail transcriptional interference, thus the 5 0 -LTR and its G4s might be involved. 80 G4 stabilizing agents have been tested in cells infected with latent HIV-1, where they showed strong antiviral activity, effectively linking G4s to HIV-1 latency. BRACO-19 in latently infected cells reduced viral titer to undetectable levels, an effect that was still observed after long-term treatment. TMPyP4 administration also blocked viral replication in two lymphocyte T cell lines with established HIV-1 latency. The antiviral activity was found to be coupled with higher apoptosis/death rates, with respect to untreated cells and the effect was enhanced upon association with DNA damage repair inhibitors. 81 ",

Altogether, the data collected in the past few years on G4s in viruses, their interaction with specific ligands and the consequent effect on the modulation of the viral machinery validate the possibility of developing G4-based antiviral drugs. The first aspect to acknowledge is that all the characterized viral G4s are located in highlyconserved genomic regions. In virology, base-conservation analysis is a critical issue, since viruses are characterized by high mutation rates. 82 The limited availability of deposited sequences for many viruses, especially the emerging ones, limits a comprehensive conservation analysis; however, data accumulated so far clearly show that PQSs are conserved elements within viruses, thus representing efficient targets in antiviral research.",

To this end, NMR and crystallographic determinations of viral G4s and their complexes with ligands are necessary, in order to allow ad hoc design of new antiviral molecules. To date, only two viral G4 structures have been solved through NMR spectroscopy: the HIV-1 LTR-III 72 and LTR-IV 73 G4s.

To this end, the virus-induced manipulation of host chromatin needs to be considered. Recently, several studies reported virus-host chromatin interactions and chromatin machinery modulation by viral proteins. 86 Epigenetic modifications of viral chromatin and viral transcriptome might be crucial in conveying the virus toward either lytic or latent infection. 87, 88 Since G4 formation has been directly linked to the suppressive role of heterochromatin and it seems to occur only in highly transcribed nucleosome-depleted chromatin regions, 89 it would be fascinating to understand how viral G4s affect and could be affected by such a complex mechanism.",

The virus attaches to the host cell through surface receptors or proteins (step 1) and enters the cell, according to different mechanisms (step 2). After penetration, the viral genome is uncoated (step 3) and released into the cytoplasm. At this stage, the DNA or RNA genome nature defines the location and the strategy adopted for genome replication (step 4): the majority of DNA viruses replicate in the cell nucleus. Most RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. For retroviruses, retrotranscription occurs in the cytoplasm, while integration takes place in the cell nucleus. After viral mRNA synthesis, viral proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm (steps 5-6). The newly synthesized viral elements (genomes and proteins) are assembled into new virions (step 7) and released outside the cell (step 8). Adapted from Ruggiero, E.; Richter, S. N.

After penetration, the viral genome is uncoated (step 3) and released into the cytoplasm. At this stage, the viral RNA is retro-transcribed into a double-stranded intermediate (step 4) which enters the nucleus, where it can be integrated into the host genome (step 5). After transcription (step 6), mRNA acts as template for the synthesis of new viral genome copies and for the expression of viral proteins in the cytoplasm (steps 6). The newly synthesized viral elements (genomes and proteins) are assembled into new virions (step 7) and released outside the cell (step 8). Adapted from Ruggiero, E.; Richter, S. N.
