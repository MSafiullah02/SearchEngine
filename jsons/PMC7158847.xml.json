            "text": "Human adenoviruses (HAdV) encompass more than 90 genotypes that are classified into 7 species designated Human mastadenovirus A through G (HAdV-A through -G) (Espinola et al., 2017; Houldcroft et al., 2018). HAdV-B comprises two subspecies, B1 and B2. In immunocompetent individuals members of subspecies HAdV-B1 and in particular types 3 and 7 are causative agents of acute respiratory disease (ARD) of variable severity (Brown et al., 1973; Chen et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2015; Hage et al., 2014; Kajon and Ison, 2016; Lin et al., 2015; Siminovich and Murtagh, 2011; Wo et al., 2015; Yamamoto et al., 2014) and also of conjunctivitis (Gopalkrishna et al., 2016; Guo et al., 1988; Martone et al., 1980). With the exception of types 14 and 55 which have been recently described as re-emerging pathogens associated with large community outbreaks of severe ARD (Cheng et al., 2018; Kajon et al., 2010, 2019; Walsh et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2017) members of subspecies HAdV-B2 are more often detected in transplant recipients and other immunocompromised patients (Echavarria, 2008; Hofland et al., 2004; Keller et al., 1977; Stalder et al., 1977). Importantly, the genomes of several HAdV-B types including HAdV-3, -11, and -35 have been manipulated for use as oncolytic viruses and also as vectors for vaccine development and gene therapy (Chia et al., 2017; Hemminki et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019; Seshidhar Reddy et al., 2003; Stone et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The species-specific E3 genes share a conserved domain (CR1) which is homologous to the RL11D domain in cytomegalovirus (Davison et al., 2003a, 2003b) and are designated CR1\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4 based on their order in the genome. The genomes of HAdV-B, -C, -D and -E encode CR1\u03b1 between \u03953-12.5\u039a and E3-gp19\u039a. Sets of 1-3 distinct species-specific HAdV E3-CR1 genes are located between the conserved E3-gp19K and E3-RID\u03b1 open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 1\n). The E3-CR1 genes are highly variable in size and sequence among species HAdV-A through \u2013F sharing limited or no homology, and are therefore believed to encode different biological functions. The conserved E3 proteins are known to be modulators of host responses to infection. For example, E3-19K (a.k.a. gp19K) sequesters MHC class I within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to prevent antigen presentation and recognition of virus infected cells by cytotoxic T cells (Burgert and Kvist, 1985; Rawle et al., 1989). The receptor internalization and degradation \u03b1 and \u03b2 (RID\u03b1 and RID\u03b2) form a complex and prevent the apoptosis of the infected cells by downregulating the expression of pro-apoptotic receptors FAS and TRAIL at the plasma membrane (Shisler et al., 1997; Tollefson et al., 1998, 2001). E3-14.7K blocks TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis of virus-infected cells (Gooding et al., 1988). In contrast, the functions of only a few E3-CR1 proteins have been identified to the present. Species HAdV-C-specific E3-CR1\u03b1 (a.k.a. E3-6.7K) functions together with the RID complex to downregulate TRAIL receptors and prevent apoptosis of virus-infected cells (Benedict et al., 2001). Species HAdV-D-specific E3-CR1\u03b2 (a.k.a. E3-49K) is secreted from infected cells and its N-terminus binds CD45 on leukocytes and suppresses the activation of NK cells and T cells (Windheim et al., 2013). Species HAdV-C-specific E3-CR1\u03b2 (a.k.a. E3-11.6K or adenovirus death protein/ADP) facilitates virus progeny release from infected cells at late stages of infection.

For this purpose, a fragment of the E3 region mapping between nucleotides 28000 and 29800 of the genome of HAdV-3 prototype strain GB, was amplified from the genomic clone pKSB2Ad3 (Sirena et al., 2005) (a generous gift from Dr. Silvio Hemi) and cloned into PCR blunt II-TOPO vector (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) to create a shuttle vector. QuikChange II XL Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA Cat# 210519) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol to insert small epitope tags, VSV-G and HA into the ORFs of E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K, respectively downstream of the signal sequence (Fig. S1). The N-tag DKO mutant shuttle vector was created using the PCR blunt II-TOPO N-tag wt shuttle vector, by mutating the first and the second codons of VSV-G E3-20.1K and HA E3-20.5K to a stop codon (TGA). Subsequently, to create pKSB2HAdV-3 N-tag wt and N-tag DKO bacmids, homologous recombination was performed by electroporating pKSB2Ad3 bacmid along with the corresponding shuttle vector into BJ5183 electroporation-competent cells (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA Cat# 200154) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The recombinant bacmids were then linearized by digestion with endonuclease MluI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA Cat# R0198L) and transfected individually into A549 cells using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Germantown, MD Cat# 301425) to generate HAdV-3 N-tag wt and HAdV-3 N-tag DKO mutant viruses. The viral genome from the newly generated mutant viruses was isolated as previously described (Kajon and Erdman, 2007) and used as a template for PCR amplification of the mutagenized portion of the E3 region using iProof High-fidelity DNA Polymerase (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA Cat# 172\u20135302). To verify the presence of tags and knock-out mutations in E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K ORFs, the amplicon was Sanger-sequenced through services contracted from GENEWIZ, South Plainfield, NJ. The sequences for the mutagenized regions of the genome of HAdV-3 in HAdV-3 N-tag wt and HAdV-3 N-tag DKO were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MT089949 and MT089950, respectively. Schematics of the mutagenized portion of the E3 region of HAdV-3 N-tag wt and HAdV-3 N-tag DKO are shown in Fig. S2A. To further quality control the newly generated HAdV-3 N-tag wt and N-tag DKO mutants, A549 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 pfu/cell. At 48 h post infection (hpi), cell lysates were examined for the expression of VSV-G E3-20.1K and HA E3-20.5K by Western blot (WB) analysis (Fig. S2B).",

The ELM tool predicted E3-CR1\u03b2 and E3-CR1\u03b3 to be type I transmembrane proteins with a large N-terminal domain and a short C-terminal tail. At the N-terminal domain both proteins have a signal sequences and putative N-glycosylation sites.

At various times pi total RNA was extracted to investigate the presence of E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K-containing transcripts by end point PCR (Fig. 3\nA), infected cells lysates were examined by WB analysis (Fig. 3B) or infected cell monolayers on coverslips were fixed and stained for immunofluorescence microspcopy (Fig. 4\n). E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K transcripts were detected using two different sets of primers that distinguish early transcripts from MLP transcripts. E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K transcripts were detectable as early as 6 hpi and were abundantly produced at late times pi, as MLP transcripts carrying the TPL sequence at their 5\u2019 end (Fig. 3A). To validate these observations we performed quantitative PCR and readily detected E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K MLP transcripts by 24 hpi (Fig. S5). Expression of both E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K proteins was detectable at 12 hpi, peaked at 48 hpi, and decreased by 72 hpi (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence microscopy studies revealed that at 24 hpi both E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K predominantly co-localized to cytoplasmic vesicles and to a lesser extent at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A). In an attempt to define the identity of the cytoplasmic vesicles, we performed co-localization studies using antibodies specific to PDI, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker, Golgin-97, a trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker, EEA1, an early lysosome marker, and LAMP2, a late endosome/lysosome marker. We observed that at 24 hpi both E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K were present in the ER, TGN, and in early endosomes but not in late endosomes/lysosomes (Figs. S6 and S7, Panels A to D). At 48 hpi when the levels of expression of both proteins peaked, the two E3 proteins co-localized predominantly at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). The localization of E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K to the plasma membrane was confirmed by detection of co-localization of the two proteins with E-cadherin (Figs. S6 and S7, Panel E). To validate our observations of subcellular localization, we co-transfected pMT2-PL mammalian expression vectors encoding VSV-G E3-20.1K and HA E3-20.5K (Fig. S3A) into HEK 293T cells. Consistent with the observations in infected A549 cells, both E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K co-localized predominantly to the plasma membrane of transfected HEK 293T cells (Fig. S8).",

Untreated E3-20.1K migrates at approximately 40 kDa.

Treatment with \u03b12-3,6,8,9 neuraminidase A and O-glycosidase either individually or sequentially did not change the electrophoretic mobility of E3-20.1K.

Untreated E3-20.5K migrated at approximately 40 and 25 kDa, likely as a result of differential glycosylation or partial glycosylation. Treatment with PNGase F resulted in a mobility shift of both bands to approximately 35 kDa and 20 kDa, respectively indicating presence of N-glycosylation. The 20 kDa band represents the predicted size of the translationally unmodified E3-20.5K polypeptide.

We observed no difference in infectious virus titers in either the extracellular compartment or in the total virus yields between cells infected with HAdV-3 wt, HAdV-3 N-tag wt, or HAdV-3 N-tag DKO. The contribution of E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K to HAdV-3 spread in cell culture was evaluated using a dissemination assay and by examination of plaque phenotypes.

The results of our recent studies determining the critical contribution of the TPL sequence to the successful ectopic expression of HAdV-B and HAdV-E E3 CR1 genes (Bair et al., 2017) suggest that the presence of this non-coding element is essential for efficient translation of HAdV-3 E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K transcripts at late times post infection.",

The N-terminal domain of HAdV-B E3-CR1\u03b3 was also shown to interact with SLAM receptors, although the functional implications of this interaction were not investigated (Martinez-Martin et al., 2016).

The YXX\u03a6 motif is present in all of the E3-CR1\u03b2 proteins encoded by human types and in most of the E3-CR1\u03b2 proteins encoded by simian members of the species. Interestingly, while the YXX\u03a6 motif is also present in many of the E3-CR1\u03b3 proteins encoded by simian HAdV-B, it is not present in any of the E3-CR1\u03b3 encoded by human types classified within this species. The LL and YXX\u03a6 motifs are sorting signals that aid in the trafficking of proteins through the secretory pathway and in the targeting of membrane proteins to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells (Heilker et al., 1999; Miranda et al., 2001). Like the LL motif in HAdV-D-specific E3-49K, the LL motif in HAdV-B E3-CR1\u03b2 and E3-CR1\u03b3 does not fit the consensus sequence of acidic (D/E)XXXL(L/I) or DXXLL di-leucine motifs (Windheim et al., 2016). The LL motif of HAdV-D E3-49K was shown to be important for trafficking of the full length protein and the C-terminal portion of the cleaved protein from the cell surface to the early endosome/trans Golgi network (TGN) and lysosomes, respectively (Windheim et al., 2016). Our observations of subcellular localization of ectopically-expressed mutant versions of HAdV-3 E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K indicate that, at least in our experimental system, obliteration of the LL motif or deletion of the class II PBM did not affect the localization of these proteins to the plasma membrane. Likewise, deletion of the N-terminal or C-terminal domains while retaining the transmembrane domain did not alter the localization of E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K. These results indicate that the TM domain of these proteins is sufficient for localization to the plasma membrane and that neither the LL nor the class II PBM nor the YXX\u03a6 motifs play a critical role in their trafficking to the plasma membrane in non-polarized cells.",

Our thorough examination of E3-CR1 protein sequences for a wide range of HAdV types representing species HAdV-A through -G identified a putative class II PBM (-SLTVCOOH), at the extreme C-terminus of E3-CR1\u03b2/11.6K encoded by various strains of HAdV-C5 (AC_000008, AY601635, KX868466, KF429754, MF681662 among others) but intriguingly, not by E3-CR1\u03b2/11.6K of types HAdV-C1, -C2 and \u2013C6 (data not shown).

For example, adenovirus E4-ORF1 contains a class I PBM (-ATLVCOOH) through which E4-ORF1 binds PDZ domain containing proteins to disrupt epithelial cell junctions of infected cells (Latorre et al., 2005).
