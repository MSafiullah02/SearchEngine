They are important causes of human and animal diseases that include respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, hepatic and neurological disorders, as well as immune-mediated diseases such as SARS and feline infectious peritonitis (reviewed in de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005, Kahn, 2006, Spaan et al., 1988, Wege et al., 1982). The coronaviruses possess a characteristic genome composition. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes two polyproteins (1a and 1ab) that contain proteins necessary for RNA replication. The 3\u2032 one-third encodes two non-structural proteins (NS1 and 2) and several structural proteins, including a nucleocapsid protein (N) and three or four envelope proteins: the membrane (M), spike (S), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and/or a small membrane (E) proteins.",

When coronavirus genome sequence data became available, the original antigenic groups were converted into three genetic groups based on the similarity of their nucleotide sequences (Gonzalez et al., 2003, Lai, 2003, Vijgen et al., 2006). Group 2 coronaviruses include murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronaviruses (BCoV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), rat sialodacryoadenitis virus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), canine respiratory coronavirus and equine coronavirus. Fifteen strains of BCoV have been sequenced and have been implicated in a variety of diseases including respiratory and enteric infections (Chouljenko et al., 2001a, Dea et al., 1995, Han et al., 2006, King and Brian, 1982, Park et al., 2006, Woloszyn et al., 1990). For example, the ENT and LUN strains were isolated from animals with fatal shipping fever pneumonia (Chouljenko et al., 2001a). The former was associated with enteritis; whereas the latter is associated with respiratory infection (pneumonia). Mebus, Quebec and DB2 are virulent strains associated with neonatal calf diarrhea and winter dysentery in adult dairy cattle (Dea et al., 1995, Han et al., 2006, Park et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Coronavirus associated with outbreaks of diarrhea in all age groups of New World camelids (llamas and alpacas) was first identified in 1998, in Oregon. The symptoms were similar to cattle infected with bovine coronavirus. Sick camelids showed varying degrees of severity of clinical disease, with some animals dying and others requiring intensive medical care. Coronavirus-like viruses were frequently isolated from the diseased animals (Cebra et al., 2003). Because of the severity of the infection and the ability of coronaviruses to cross the species barriers, including human\u2013animal barriers, we undertook an investigation to further characterize this virus. In this report we describe the sequence of the ACoV and compare it to other members of the coronavirus genus. We found that it is closely related to Group 2 bovine coronaviruses.",

The oligonucleotide primer sets used for these amplifications are listed in Table 1\n. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the genome were determined by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032RACE, respectively. This resulted in a genome sequence of 31,076 nt including a poly A tail of 38 nt. The genome encodes 10 ORFs characteristic of Group 2 BCoV and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated sequences of 210 and 298 nts (which do not include the poly A tail), respectively (Fig. 1\n). The ORF coordinates are shown in Fig. 1. The predicted ORF 1a and ORF 1ab contained 13,152 and 21,282 nt, respectively (Fig. 1). ORF 1ab contains a 26 nt region that overlapped with ORF 1a and included a predicted \u2018slippery\u2019 sequence UUUAAAC. Based on evidence from other coronaviruses (Chouljenko et al., 2001b), this sequence causes a \u2212 1 frameshift during the translation of ORF1a. This results in a portion of the proteins (called ORF 1ab) avoiding translation termination and containing an additional 2711 amino acids. Upstream of five of the genes, there is a repeated intergenic sequence, UCUAAAC, that is predicted to interact with the viral transcriptase along with cellular factors to \u2018splice\u2019 the leader sequence onto the start of each ORF. ORF-NS1, HE, S, M and N were all preceded by this sequence (Table 2\n), which would be predicted to give rise to a nested set of mRNAs characteristic of the order Nidovirales.",

The ACoV HE protein is phylogenetically similar to those of BCoV ENT and LUN, with one and three amino acid differences, respectively (Fig. 3B). In addition, the following differences were noted between ACoV and the most closely related BCoV strains for the structural proteins: membrane (M), one difference out of 229 aa; internal orf (I), two differences out of 207 aa; and N, one to five differences out of 448 aa. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronavirus has been used as an early diagnostic marker for coronaviruses such as the SARS virus (Che et al., 2004). The highly conserved small membrane envelope (E) protein is unique to BCoV Group 2 and is identical between ACoV and the closely related BCoV strains. A similar pattern of relatedness was evident for the non-structural (NS) proteins. There were one to two aa differences in the predicted 32 kDa NS1 protein of ACoV compared to the most closely related BCoV ENT and LUN strains. This protein is not essential for virus replication in vitro, but has been implicated in virus pathogenicity (Vijgen et al., 2006). There were also one to two aa mutations between the predicted 12.7 kDa NS2 and those from the most closely related BCoV isolates.",

The spike protein of ACoV and BCoV is 1363 aa long. The predicted proteolytic cleavage site (KRRSRR) was conserved between all strains. Cleavage at this site results in the production of two subunits (S1 and S2) in the well-characterized murine coronaviruses (de Haan et al., 2006). S1 and S2 of ACoV were predicted to be 760 and 603 amino acids, respectively. The neighbor-joining method of molecular evolutionary analysis revealed that the ACoV S protein appears to evolve at a somewhat accelerated rate compared to other proteins, e.g., the HE (Fig. 3). The predicted ACoV S protein had 9 and 12 amino acid differences from the predicted S proteins of BCoV strains LUN and ENT, respectively. Most of the mutations occurred in the S1 subunit. Three ACoV S amino acid changes are particularly striking, including: serine at aa #174; proline at 565; and serine at 702. In all the other S proteins analyzed (Fig. 3A and Table 4\n), these amino acids replace a Pro, Leu and Leu, respectively. The loss of one proline (#174) and the gain of another (#565) could significantly alter the structure of ACoV relative to the homologs from the closely related viruses. It has been shown that S2 is not directly involved in receptor binding, indicating that changes in S1 could be involved in host specificity (de Haan et al., 2006).",

New World camelids have been in contact with cattle for over 500 years in South America, compared to their relatively recent and small-scale introduction to North America. Although the identification of coronaviral infection and epidemic diarrhea in all age groups of llamas and alpacas occurred only recently, it is possible that the virus crossed between species during earlier interspecies contact or is a BCoV strain that is pathogenic for both bovids and camelids, although BCoV infection in camelids had not been described previous to the Cebra et al.

The S protein forms distinctive surface projections on the virions and is responsible for the primary attachment of the virus to cell surface receptors (Schultze et al., 1991). It is a glycosylated and acetylated polypeptide with a molecular weight of 170 kDa to 220 kDa and is the major hemagglutinin of bovine coronaviruses (Schultze and Herrler, 1994). It has been suggested that the high degree of variation in host range and tissue tropism of coronaviruses is largely attributable to variations in the S glycoprotein (Gallagher, 2001). There are a number of distinct differences in S proteins between the respiratory isolates and diarrhea isolates (of bovine coronaviruses, human and porcine). Although the importance of such variability in the virulence and tropism of BCoV is unknown, some amino acid changes could have significant effects on the conformation, charge, hydrophobicity and antigenic regions of the protein. These mutations could change either the protein folding or physicochemical characteristics and could be involved in altering the host specificity of the virus.",
