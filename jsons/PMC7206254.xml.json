            "text": "Nowadays, huge amount of data is produced by a large and diverse family of sensors (e.g., remote sensors, biochemical sensors, wearable devices). Modern sensors typically measure multiple variables over time, resulting in streams of data that can be profitably organized as multivariate time-series. While a major part of recent literature about multivariate time-series focuses on tasks such as forecasting [14, 19, 20] and classification [11, 26] of such data objects, the study of multivariate time-series clustering has often been neglected. The development of effective unsupervised clustering techniques is crucial in practical scenarios, where labeling enough data to deploy a supervised process may be too expensive (i.e., in terms of both time and money). Moreover, clustering allows to discover characteristics of multivariate time series data that go beyond the apriori knowledge on a specific domain, serving as tool to support subsequent exploration and analysis processes.",

Early approaches have been proposed which were generally based on adaptations of standard clustering techniques to such data, e.g., density based methods [3], methods based on independent component analysis [25] and fuzzy approaches [5, 8]. Recently, Hallac et al. [9] proposed a method, namely TICC (Toeplitz inverse covariance-based clustering), that segments multivariate time series and, successively, clusters subsequences through a Markov Random fields based approach. The algorithm leverages an (EM)-like strategy, based on alternating minimization, that iteratively clusters the data and then updates the cluster parameters. Unfortunately, this method does not produce a clustering solution considering the original time series but a data partition where the unit of analysis is the subsequence.",

Tzirakis et al. [24] recently proposed a segmentation/clustering framework based on agglomerative clustering which works on video data (time series of RGB images). The approach firstly extracts a clustering assignment via hierarchical clustering, then performs temporal segmentation and, finally, extracts representation via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The clustering assignment is used as pseudo-label information to extract the new representation (training the CNN network) and to perform video segmentation. The proposed approach is specific to RGB video segmentation/clustering and it is not well suited for varying length information. All these factors limit its use to standard multivariate time-series analysis. A method based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) has also been recently proposed in [23]. The representation provided by the RNN is clustered using a divergence-based clustering loss function in an end-to-end manner. The loss function is designed to consider cluster separability and compactness, cluster orthogonality and closeness of cluster memberships to a simplex corner. The approach requires training and validation data to learn parameters and choose hyperparameter setting, respectively. Finally, the framework is evaluated on a test set indicating that the approach seems not completely unsupervised and, for this reason, not directly exploitable in our scenario.",

Differently from previous approaches, our framework is enough general to deal with time-series coming from different domains, providing a partition at the time-series level as well as manage varying length information. The DeTSEC has two stages: firstly a recurrent autoencoder exploits attention and gating mechanisms to produce a preliminary embedding representation. Then, a clustering refinement stage is introduced to stretch the embedding manifold towards the corresponding clusters. We provide an experimental analysis which includes comparison with five state of the art methods and ablations analysis of the proposed framework on six real-world benchmarks from different domains. The results of this analysis highlight the effectiveness of the proposed framework as well as the added value of the new learnt representation.",

We underline that X can contain time-series with different lengths. The goal of DeTSEC is to partition X in a given number of clusters, provided as an input parameter. To this purpose, we propose to deal with the multivariate time-series clustering task by means of recurrent neural networks [1] (RNN), in order to manage at the same time (i) the sequential information exhibited by time-series data and (ii) the multivariate (multi-dimensional) information that characterizes time-series acquired by real-world sensors. Our approach exploits a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [4], a type of RNN, to model the time-series behavior and to encode the original time-series in a new vector embedding representation. DeTSEC has two different stages. In the first one, the GRU based autoencoder is exploited to summarize the time-series information and to produce the new vector embedding representation, obtained by forcing the network to reconstruct the original signal, that integrates the temporal behavior and the multi-dimensional information. Once the autoencoder network has been pretrained, the second stage of our framework refines such representation by taking into account a twofold task, i.e., the reconstruction one and another one devoted to stretch the embedding manifold towards clustering centroids. Such centroids can be derived by applying any centroid-based clustering algorithm (i.e. K-means) on the new data representation. The final clustering assignment is derived by applying the K-means clustering algorithm on the embeddings produced by DeTSEC.\n",

            "text": "Figure 1 visually depicts the encoder/decoder structure of DeTSEC, consisting of three different components in our network architecture: i) an encoder, ii) a backward decoder and iii) a forward decoder. The encoder is composed by two GRU units that process the multivariate time series: the first one (in red) processes the time-series in reverse order (backward) while the second one (in green) processes the input time-series in the original order (forward). Successively, for each GRU unit, an attention mechanism [2] is applied to combine together the information coming from different timestamps. Attention mechanisms are widely used in automatic signal processing [2] (1D signal or Natural Language Processing) as they allow to merge together the information extracted by the RNN model at different timestamps via a convex combination of the input sources. The attention formulation we used is the following one:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} v_{a}&= tanh(H\\cdot {}W_{a} + b_{a}) \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}\n2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} \\lambda&= SoftMax(v_{a} \\odot u_{a}) \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}\n3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} h^{att}&= \\sum _{j=1}^{T} \\lambda _j \\cdot h_{t_{j}} \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$H \\in \\mathbb {R}^{T,l}$$\\end{document} is a matrix obtained by vertically stacking all feature vectors \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$h_{t_j} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{l}$$\\end{document} learned at T different timestamps by the GRU and l is the hidden state size of the GRU network.

Similarly to K-means, also this approach is suited for data with fixed length. Also in this case we perform zero padding to fit all the time-series lengths to the size of the longest one.The Dynamic Time Warping measures [7] (DTW) coupled with K-means algorithm. Such distance measure is especially tailored for time-series data with variable length-size.The Soft Dynamic Time Warping measures introduced in [6] (SOFTDTW). This measure is a differentiable distance measure recently introduced to manage dissimilarity evaluation between multivariate time-series of variable length.
