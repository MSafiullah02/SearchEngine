            "text": "Recently, there has been a widespread interest in using evolutionary game theory to study economic system, which remedies some drawbacks of orthodox game theory. In particular, orthodox game theory assumes that (a) players are fully rational and can take an optimal action (sophisticated); (b) they have the common knowledge of rationality; (c) they know the rules of the game. But, in reality players often have bounded rationality, can not take an optimal action (na\u00efve), may not know the others\u2019 rationality and the rules of the game, which are the assumptions made in evolutionary game theory. Even rational players often make mistakes that will affect the strategies of other players. Other fully rational players often make noise in the form of mutations or mistakes (see Young, 1993). There may be multiple solutions of general non-cooperative games. How do players choose among multiple solutions? It is very difficult for orthodox game theory to answer this question, but rather straightforward for evolutionary game theory. From a particular starting point, a unique steady state will be reached in a evolutionary game. The selected equilibrium is path-dependent, and the observed equilibrium depends on the initial condition.",

            "text": "Our study is closely related to the disruption management and evolutionary management of a supply chain, and duopoly competition. There are literatures studying oligopoly competition from evolutionary perspective. For the competition of the quantity-setting homogeneous oligopoly, see, for example, Tanaka (1999) studied the stochastically stable output of the asymmetric homogeneous oligopoly with low cost and high cost firms and showed that a stochastically stable output equals the competitive (Walrasian) output. Bischi and Kopel (2001) considered a simple Cournot-type duopoly market where competitors produce homogeneous goods and offer them at discrete time periods on a common market. They showed that for the nonlinear model multiple (locally) stable equilibriums may be observed. In this paper, we will study the quantity-setting homogeneous duopoly. Xiao and Yu (2005) studied the evolutionarily stable marketing strategies of retailers in two vertically integrated channels with differentiated goods. In the model, they analyzed the effects of the type of strategic interaction (strategic substitutes or complements). In this paper, we consider the two vertically integrated channels with homogeneous goods. There are literatures studying the differentiated goods competition (see, Tanaka, 2000, Xiao and Yu, 2005). Tanaka (2000) presented evolutionary game theoretic analyses of symmetric price-setting and quantity-setting oligopolies with differentiated goods. Jin (2001) showed that a simple and optimal price strategy could lead the market to a unique steady state. He found that the price convergence does not necessarily require almost perfect information and full rationality. In our model, we investigate the quantity-setting duopoly other than the price-setting duopoly. Xiao and Yu (2005) showed that profit maximization is a unique ESS in the price-setting duopoly situation with differentiated goods and linear inverse demand functions. Hence, we do not consider the price-setting duopoly situation.",

            "text": "On the evolutionary management of a supply chain, Kosfeld (2002) argued that the \u2018solution\u2019 to the coordination problem between stores and customers depends on the specific cost structure of stores and the preferences of customers. In his model, the demand is deterministic. However, a typical supply chain frequently faces disruptions caused by internal or external factors including demand fluctuations (new orders, order cancellations), raw material shortages, delivery delays due to transportation problems or inclement weather (such as storm, heavy fog), resource unavailability, natural disasters, etc. The supply chain disruption management is a new and interesting field. Qi et al. (2004) considered the coordination of a supply chain with one supplier and one retailer under demand disruptions. In their model, the demand disruptions incur a penalty to the supplier. Xia et al. (2004b) considered disruption management for a two-stage production and inventory system. Xia et al. (2004a) introduced a production and inventory management model with raw material supply disruptions. Xiao et al. (2005) considered the coordination of a supply chain with one manufacturer and two competing retailers when the demand is disrupted. Huntington (2003) studied the effect of energy disruptions on the decision-making of firms and aggregate economy. In addition to the disruption caused by accidental events, strategic disruption is often used by some firms. Strategic disruption refers to a firm\u2019s intentional manipulation of its competitor\u2019s transaction cost structure in an attempt to weaken the competitor\u2019s alignment of its governance structure. Averyt and Ramagopal (1999) used the auto industry as a case to examine the policy of strategic disruption pursued by American producers against Japanese competitors since the 1980s. In their model, a firm destroys its competitor\u2019s alignment of transactions and governance structures but leaves the firm\u2019s own alignment relatively unchanged through altering governance rules. Thus, its competitor\u2019s cost increases. In 1992, the United States and Japan signed the \u2018Global Partnership Plan of Action\u2019, which is a strategic disruption management policy of breaking the established ties between Japanese auto producers and Japanese parts suppliers (Lewis and Weiler, 1996). To our best knowledge, an evolutionary perspective on the effect of disruptions on a supply chain has not yet been studied in the literature. This paper will study the effect of the supply chain disruptions including the raw material supply and demand disruptions on the retailers\u2019 strategies by employing an indirect evolutionary game model. We neglect the penalty cost incurred by the supply chain disruptions when we consider the long-term equilibrium because the manufacturers will adjust their production scales and plans rapidly. In Section 6, we will also consider the case with a penalty cost. We will illustrate our findings using a numerical simulation.",

Bester and G\u00fcth (1998) argued that altruism preferences may be evolutionarily stable. In other words, a profit maximization strategy may be evolutionarily unstable (see Bolle, 2000). Schaffer (1989) applied the finite population evolutionarily stable strategy to study whether profit-maximizers are the best survivors. He showed that the strategy that survives in an economic natural selection is the relative, not absolute, payoff maximization strategy. G\u00fcth and Peleg (2001) studied when a payoff maximization strategy will survive by employing an indirect evolutionary game. Xiao and Yu (2005) introduced an indirect evolutionary game approach to explain why there exists revenue maximization behavior and argued that a revenue maximization strategy may be a stable strategy and a profit maximization strategy may be unstable in the quantity-setting duopoly situation with differentiated goods. In this paper, we assume that a retailer has two strategies: profit maximization and revenue maximization. We will study the stability conditions of the profit maximization strategy. Our dynamic system is a special ordinary differential equation system that satisfies the admissible conditions given in Friedman (1991). We find that profit maximization strategy may become extinct and revenue maximization strategy prevails when the market scale is large enough. In this case, the retailers choosing revenue maximization strategy will gain more profit through selling more goods although the unit profit decreases. We also find that the relative unit cost affects the retailers\u2019 strategies and the coexistence phenomenon often happens. Supply chain disruption is often recovered within a finite desired time, so we also introduce a disruption recovery model.",

            "text": "Assume that an economic system consists of two vertically integrated channels denoted by A and B. Every channel consists of one manufacturer and many (a sufficiently large number of) retailers. The manufacturer in channel i denoted by i, i\n = \nA, \nB. The manufacturers need some raw materials to produce homogeneous products. The retailers respectively sell products in many (a sufficiently large number of) independent markets (Boyaci and Gallego, 2002). We call a retailer in channel i an individual in population i consisting of all retailers in channel i, i\n = \nA, \nB. An individual in population A randomly competes with an individual in population B in a market (there are exactly two retailers in a given market, we will eliminate a market if neither a pair of retailers is matched in this market). For simplicity, we do not consider the intra-population\u2019s competition that two individuals in the same population compete. Every individual has two (pure) strategies: profit maximization (for short P) and revenue maximization (for short R). In a one-shot game, two individuals simultaneously determine their marketing strategies, and determine optimal quantities according to their strategies. Hosomatsu (1969) showed how oligopoly firms reach a Cournot equilibrium without knowing the demand function and rivals\u2019 costs. Hehenkamp et al. (1999) showed that the quantity distribution always converges under monotonic selection dynamic system to a distribution with probability one on a quantity equal or similar to a classical Cournot equilibrium. For simplicity, we assume that every retailer can take its optimal quantity reaction based on its preference (P or R). We focus on the ESS of the preferences. In other words, we study the ESS of the populations by employing an indirect evolutionary game. Friedman and Mezzetti (2002) set up a quantity choice model of dynamic oligopoly with bounded rationality. However, they retained an important feature of rational behavior strategy, profit maximization. We also assume that the individuals have bounded rationality. We focus on the distribution of the individual strategies in the population. In our model, the individuals repeatedly play an evolutionary game other than a one-shot game with each other. Let the unit production cost of manufacturer i be c\ni and the quantity of goods of a retailer in channel i be q\ni, i\n = \nA, \nB. We normalize the unit cost of retailers to zero.\n1 The unit price is p. We assume that every market faces the same inverse demand function and two channels monopolize markets. Without loss of generality, we assume that c\nA\n \u2a7e \nc\nB and the inverse demand function is p\n = \na\n \u2212 \nq\nA\n \u2212 \nq\nB, or q\nA\n + \nq\nB\n = \na\n \u2212 \np. The parameter a represents the market scale and a\n > max{c\nA, \nc\nB} = \nc\nA. The analysis can be extended to the case with nonlinear inverse demand function.",

Without loss of generality, we assume that the population\u2019s strategy evolve in the form of a Malthusian dynamic system (or replicator dynamic system) which is a very general dynamic system in evolutionary game theory (for detailed, see Friedman, 1991, Cressman, 1992, Xiao, 2004). In a replicator dynamic system, the growth rate s\u02d9A/sA equals the strategy P\u2019s fitness e\n1\nA(s\nB, 1 \u2212 \ns\nB)T less the average fitness (s\nA, 1 \u2212 \ns\nA)A(s\nB, 1 \u2212 \ns\nB)T of population A, where s\u02d9A=dsA/dt, e\n1\n = (1, 0), represents that all individuals in population A choose strategy P, and A=\u03c0APP\u03c0APR\u03c0ARP\u03c0ARR, represents the payoff matrix of individual A.

SARS affected to a large degree the demand for tourism, recreation, food, medicine and the related industries in the regions. Some rumors on the fact that vinegar can prevent SARS were released after SARS was discovered in Guangzhou, China, and then the demand for vinegar increased dramatically.

In the real world, the disruptions of raw material supplies often result in the change of raw material price. If the raw material supplier launches a promotion, it will reduce price. The material supplier desires to earn more profit by increasing its unit price. Sometimes, the raw material price increases due to a shortage. When some crises are anticipated, the price will increase although there is ample supply currently. Examples on the raw material price increase could be seen from the crude oil price change in our daily life (the oil supply disruptions from the Middle East often result in the change of the crude oil price). We assume that \u0394c\ni, is the changed amount of the unit production cost of manufacturer i, i\n = \nA, \nB, i.e., the unit production cost after disruptions is c\ni\n + \u0394c\ni. For example, the production cost of a manufacturer whose raw material supply depends on other countries increases (decreases) if the tariff increases (decreases). In general, we have sign (\u0394c\nA) = sign(\u0394c\nB), i.e., the unit production costs of the two manufacturers increase or decrease simultaneously because they produce homogeneous goods. But, the changed amounts can be different. In this section, we will study how the raw material supply disruptions affect the ESS of retailers without considering recovery. We assume that the demand is not disrupted. We can also regard the case in which the manufacturers do not know the recovery time as the case without considering recovery. In this case, the manufacturers do not expect recovery and thus adjust their production scale rapidly. Although they will suffer loss, the loss is transient and it does not affect the ESS of retailers.

For example, the demand disruptions often affect the retailer\u2019s strategy. The raw material supply disruptions also affect the retailer\u2019s strategy. The indirect evolutionary approach does not deny rational decision-making. This paper employs the usual rationality assumptions of game theory to endogenize preference strategies (revenue maximization and profit maximization), and analyzes the ESS of preference. In our model, the retailers can maximize their utilities, revenue or profit of the channel, based on their preferences. And then we focus on the preference strategies.",
