            "text": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been shown to induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells through the action of MAPKs, NF-kB, and AP-1. On the other hand, the transcription factor CREB has also been implicated in the expression of COX-2 in other cell lines. Here, we report that EV71-induced COX-2 expression and PGE 2 production were both inhibited by pretreatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 or by transfection with CREB siRNA. In addition, EV71-induced COX-2 expression and c-Src/EGFR phosphorylation were both attenuated by transfection with c-Src siRNA or pretreatment with the inhibitors of c-Src (PP1) or EGF receptor (EGFR) (AG1478 and EGFRneutralizing antibody). We also observed that EV71-induced p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation was decreased following pretreatment with AG1478. Moreover, EV71-induced COX-2 expression was blocked by pretreatment with the p300 inhibitor GR343 or by transfection with p300 siRNA. Using immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we observed that EV71 stimulated the association of CREB and p300 with the COX-2 promoter region. Notably, we also demonstrated that EV71-induced COX-2 expression and PGE 2 production promoted viral replication via cAMP signaling. In summary, this study demonstrates that EV71 activates the c-Src/EGFR/p42/p44 MAPK pathway in human SK-N-SH cell, which leads to the activation of CREB/p300, and stimulates COX-2 expression and PGE 2 release.",

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an important role during acute CNS inflammation or following an injury since it is rapidly induced by various stimuli usually implicated with these conditions, including virus infections. The COX-2 enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) in various cell types [Hinson and Tyor, 2001; Chen and Reis, 2002] . The expression of COX-2 is regulated by several transcription factors including the cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) [Tsatsanis et al., 2006] . We had previously demonstrated that EV71 induced COX-2 expression via NF-kB and AP-1 in SK-N-SH cells [Tung et al., 2010] . On the other hand, CREB have also been shown to regulate COX-2 expression by binding to the cyclic adenosine 3 0 ,5 0 -monophosphate (cAMP) response element (CRE) present in the COX-2 promoter which harbors the core sequence CGTCA [Desdouets et al., 1995; Ahn et al., 1998; Lonze and Ginty, 2002; Impey et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005; White et al., 2006; Klein et al., 2007] .",

CREB is activated by phosphorylation at Ser 133 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and/or following nuclear translocation of the transducer of regulated CREB activity [Shaywitz and Greenberg, 1999; Mayr and Montminy, 2001; Conkright et al., 2003; Iourgenko et al., 2003 ]. In addition, CREB is activated by virus infection in various cell types. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S protein regulates COX-2 gene expression through two independent signaling pathways: the calcium-dependent NF-kB signaling pathway and the calcium-independent CREB pathway [Liu et al., 2007b] . In addition, transcriptional activation of NOXA by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or by sendai virus (SV) requires the presence of CREB as well as interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-3. In this case, SV infection has been shown to activate CREB by a pathway involving Ca 2\u00fe -independent phopholipase A 2 [Lallemand et al., 2007] . We have previously demonstrated that COX-2 expression and PGE 2 production induced by EV71 requires the action of MAPKs (p42/p44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and JNK1/2), thereby linking EV71 infection with the activation of NF-kB and AP-1. However, whether CREB is implicated in COX-2 expression during EV71 infection in human neurons remains unknown.",

However, several other signaling pathways have been shown to regulate CREB activity. For instance, angiotensin II activates the AT1 receptor which leads to phosphorylation of CREB via Cdc42/ PAK1/MKK3/6/p38 MAPK [Pham et al., 2008] . In addition, CREB activation can be stimulated by either transactivation of EGF receptor (EGFR) by angiotensin II or directly by binding of EGF to the EGFR which activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/p42/p44 MAPK and the Rac/PAK1/MEK/p42/p44 MAPK pathways. The activated form of CREB binds to COX-2 promoter and activates COX-2 expression [Pham et al., 2008] . Several studies have demonstrated that CREB phosphorylation is mediated through an EGFR-dependent cascade in various cell types [Amorino et al., 2002; Laag et al., 2006; Ozgen et al., 2008] . However, whether activation of EGFR by EV71 infection could lead to COX-2 expression in neurons remains unclear.",

To verify the transcriptional regulation of COX-2 gene in this context, SK-N-SH cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter vector containing an exogenous COX-2 promoter, and the cells were then stimulated with EV71 (moi \u00bc 5) for 16 h. As shown in Figure 1E , EV71 infection stimulated COX-2 promoter activity which was attenuated by H89. To verify whether the CREB-binding site CRE was required for these responses, the cells were transfected with a mutated COX-2 promoter. As shown in Figure 1F , EV71-stimulated COX-2 promoter activity was decreased by transfection with a mutated CRE (Mt-CRE) in the COX-2 promoter, suggesting that CREB was required for EV71-induced COX-2 expression. Moreover, EV71 stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1G ). In this case, a maximal response was obtained within 30-45 min and then declined to the basal level within 60 min (Fig. 1G) . The phosphorylation of CREB was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with H89 (Fig. 1H ). In addition, we compared the effects of EV71 and UV-irradiated EV71 (EV71 was irradiated with 365-nm UV light for 30 min in a 10-cm dish) on these responses. UV-irradiated EV71 could also induce the activation of CREB, indicating that CREB activation required virus binding and entry into the cell, while activation was independent of viral replication (data not shown). These results were transfected with CREB siRNA, and were incubated with EV71 for 12 h. (C) Cells were pretreated with H89 for 1 h before incubation with EV71 for 16 h.

The association of CREB and p300 leads to enhancement of p300 transcriptional activity and increases the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Thus, we investigated whether CREB-activated p300 could play a role in EV71-induced COX-2 expression. As shown in Figure 5A , EV71induced COX-2 expression was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with GR343 (an inhibitor of p300) [Mantelingu et al., 2007] . To further determine whether p300 was required for EV71-induced COX-2 expression, as shown in Figure 5B , transfection with p300 siRNA down-regulated the expression of total p300 protein and significantly reduced COX-2 expression following EV71 infection. Next, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to ensure that CREB was directly associated with p300 in response to EV71 (Fig. 5C ). To further investigate whether both CREB and p300 were recruited to the promoter region of COX-2 following EV71 infection, ChIP assays were performed using either an anti-CREB or anti-p300 antibody. The cells were incubated with EV71 for the indicated time intervals. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated by using either an anti-CREB or anti-p300 antibody. As expected, EV71 stimulated the recruitment of both CREB and p300 to the COX-2 promoter region within 10-30 min, which was attenuated by pretreatment with H89 ( Fig. 5D and E) . These results suggested that EV71 stimulated the association between CREB and p300 and recruited to COX-2 promoter.",

Previous studies have reported that PP1 blocks EGFR transactivation stimulated by glucagon-like peptide 1 in pancreatic b-cells [Ohtsu et al., 2006] . Our results indicated that c-Src was involved in EV71-induced EGFR and CREB activation since pretreatment with PP1 attenuated the phosphorylation of these signaling proteins. In addition, we demonstrated that EV71 activated the association of c-Src and EGFR, which was blocked by pretreatment with either AG1478 or PP1 ( Fig. 2E and F) . Therefore, transactivation of EGFR could represent one of the basic mechanisms underlying the mitogenic activity of EV71 in SK-N-SH cells. Moreover, COX-2 protein expression, PGE 2 production, COX-2 mRNA synthesis, and COX-2 promoter activity were induced by EV71 infection, which were inhibited by pretreatment with AG1478, an EGFR-neutralizing antibody, PP1, or transfection with c-Src siRNA (Fig. 3A-F) .

In the present study, pretreatment of SK-N-SH cells with AG1478 inhibited EV71stimulated p42/p44 phosphorylation, indicating that activation of EGFR was required for this cellular response (Fig. 4A) .

The infected cells were treated with H89 for 1 h before incubation with either PGE 2 or forskolin for 4 h. (B) Cells were infected with EV71 for 1 h and were treated with AH6809 or GW627368x as indicated, prior to incubation with PGE 2 for 4 h. The expression of VP1 mRNA was determined by real-time PCR.

Proposed model to illustrate the signaling pathways involved in COX-2 expression and PGE 2 release in SK-N-SH cells infected with EV71. EV71induced COX-2 expression is mediated through c-Src, EGFR, p42/p44 MAPK, and CREB. Phosphorylated CREB in turn interacts with p300 and the resulting complex binds to the promoter region of COX-2. The expression of COX-2 and the concomitant release of PGE 2 following EV71 infection could subsequently enhance viral replication via cAMP signaling. pretreatment with U0126 (Fig. 4B ), but not by treatment with other MAPK inhibitors, such as SB203580 (inhibitor of p38 MAPK) and SP600125 (inhibitor of JNK1/2) (data not shown). These results were consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that the total cell number of both Rat-2 fibroblast cells and BrdU-positive cells increased following treatment with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) via a p42/p44 MAPK/CREB pathway [Kwon et al., 2009] . We suggested that activation of the p42/p44 MAPK signaling pathway was required for CREB activation. Nonetheless, we also demonstrated that EV71 induced the activation of Akt by using inhibitors of PI-3K (LY294002) or AG1478. In addition, pretreatment with LY294002 or transfection with Akt siRNA significantly attenuated the activation of Akt and COX-2 expression following EV71 infection in SK-N-SH cells. However, pretreatment with LY294002 had no significant effect on EV71-stimulated CREB phosphorylation (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that EV71-induced COX-2 expression was dependent on CREB mediated through c-Src/EGFR/ p42/p44 MAPK, but not c-Src/EGFR/Akt in SK-N-SH cells.",

            "text": "On the basis of observations published in the literature and the findings presented here, we propose a signaling model to explain the downstream events that occur following infection of SK-N-SH cells by EV71. As depicted in Figure 7 , EV71 stimulates the activation of EGFR through c-Src and leads to phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK. The MAPK p42/p44 in turn promotes the activation of CREB. Furthermore, CREB associates with p300 and the resulting complex is recruited to the COX-2 promoter region to activate COX-2 promoter activity, mRNA accumulation, and protein expression. In summary, our findings suggested that EV71-induced COX-2 expression may be mediated through c-Src/EGFR/p42/p44 MAPK/ CREB signaling in SK-N-SH cells. Based on our earlier findings [Tung et al., 2010] , EV71 was shown to induce the expression of COX-2 and the production of PGE 2 in SK-N-SH cells through the concerted action of c-Src, EGFR, MAPKs, NF-kB, AP-1, and CREB. The production of PGE 2 following EV71 infection further promoted viral replication through EP2/EP4 receptors-cAMP signaling. Therefore, pharmacological approaches which target COX-2 and its upstream signaling components may provide useful strategies to limit the deleterious effects of CNS inflammation during viral infection.",
