Approximately 8000 people were infected during the SARS-CoV epidemic (\u223c10% mortality; http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/), while the global MERS tally is now over 1800 laboratory-confirmed cases, with a mortality of about 35% (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/). In mid-2015, an air travel-related outbreak in South Korea (186 confirmed cases, 36 deaths, and about 17,000 potentially exposed individuals quarantined) again illustrated the socioeconomic impact of this kind of emerging pathogen, also outside regions in which the virus is endemic (http://www.who.int/csr/don/07-july-2015-mers-korea/en/). The lack of effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans remains a serious public health concern, especially given increasing evidence that SARS-like coronaviruses continue to circulate in bats and may have the potential to readily cross the species barrier and emerge as human pathogens (Ge et al., 2013, Menachery et al., 2015).",

The outcome of the clinical use of interferons was variable, with some reports questioning the long-term survival benefits (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014, Omrani et al., 2014, Shalhoub et al., 2015), whereas others suggested that further investigation is warranted (Khalid et al., 2016), possibly in combination with the use of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kim et al., 2015). Unfortunately, some of the negative outcomes are confounded by the late-stage treatment of critically-ill patients.",

            "text": "Since the development and registration of novel therapeutic compounds is generally time consuming, the repurposing of approved drugs offers one of the few shortcuts to establishing anti-coronavirus therapy. Several FDA-approved compounds have been reported to inhibit MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV replication in cell culture (de Wilde et al., 2014, Dyall et al., 2014, Hart et al., 2013), but their efficacy in animal models remains to be determined. Previously, the FDA-approved drug cyclosporin A (CsA) was shown to inhibit the replication of a variety of viruses (reviewed in Nagy et al., 2011), including coronaviruses (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2014, de Wilde et al., 2013b, de Wilde et al., 2011, Kim and Lee, 2014, Pfefferle et al., 2011, Tanaka et al., 2012). CsA targets members of the cyclophilin (Cyp) family, which are peptidyl-proline isomerases (PPIases) that act as chaperones in protein folding and function (Davis et al., 2010). Since the immuno suppressive properties of CsA (Schreiber and Crabtree, 1992) are an undesirable side-effect in the context of antiviral therapy, numerous non-immunosuppressive Cyp inhibitors have been developed. Among these, alisporivir (ALV) showed increased sustained viral response during treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in phase III clinical trials, when treatment with ribavirin and pegylated interferon was combined with ALV (Buti et al., 2015, Flisiak et al., 2012, Pawlotsky et al., 2015, Zeuzem et al., 2015).",

            "text": "In this study, we have first investigated whether ALV inhibits MERS- and SARS-CoV replication in cell culture. We employed previously described cell-culture based screening assays relying on the rapid cytopathic effect (CPE) observed in coronavirus-infected cells (de Wilde et al., 2013b, de Wilde et al., 2014). First, the viability of MERS-CoV-infected Vero cells (MOI 0.005) treated with increasing ALV concentrations was assessed at 3 days post infection (p.i.). We found that virus-induced CPE was prevented by ALV in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 3.6 \u03bcM; Fig. 1\nA). A similar efficacy was observed in MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells (MOI 0.005) (EC50 3.4 \u03bcM; Fig. 1B). The toxicity of ALV treatment was assessed for both cell lines and CC50 values were found to be comparable and 7\u201313 times higher than the observed EC50 values (26.4 and 43.8 \u03bcM, respectively; see Fig. 1A-B). ALV sensitivity was not restricted to the original MERS-CoV isolate (EMC/2012; Zaki et al., 2012) as similar EC50 values of 1.5 and 3.0 \u03bcM were determined when using MERS-CoV strain N3/Jordan in Vero (MOI 0.05) and Huh7 cells (MOI 0.005), respectively (Fig. 1C-D). The potential of ALV to inhibit other betacoronaviruses was illustrated by the complete block of SARS-CoV replication in VeroE6 cells. The SARS-CoV field isolate Frankfurt-1 was inhibited with an EC50 of 8.3 \u03bcM (CC50 in VeroE6 cells is >50 \u03bcM; Fig. 1E; de Wilde et al., 2014) and for the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strain MA-15 (MOI 0.05; kindly provided by prof. Luis Enjuanes, National Center of Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC), Madrid, Spain) an EC50 of 1.3 \u03bcM was determined. The EC50, CC50, and selectivity index (SI) values are summarized in Table 1\n.",

Progeny virus from MERS-CoV-infected Vero cells was harvested at 48 h p.i. and titrated by plaque assay, which revealed a \u223c2 log reduction when using 6.3 \u03bcM ALV (Fig. 2\nA). This effect was more pronounced in Huh7 cells, as a comparable decrease in progeny titer was already observed when using 3.1 \u03bcM ALV (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained using fully differentiated primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cells, of which the non-ciliated cells were shown to be the primary target for MERS-CoV infection (Raj et al., 2013). First, air\u2013liquid interface cultures derived from two donors were cultured for 14 days on semi-permeable transwell membranes (van Wetering et al., 2007). Next, these HAE cell cultures were pretreated for 16 h with 25 \u03bcM ALV or 0.13% EtOH (vehicle control) and infected with MERS-CoV isolate EMC/2012 (MOI of 2; titer determined on Vero cells). After a 48-h ALV treatment, MERS-CoV progeny titers were reduced by 1 or 3 log, depending on the donor (Fig. 2C-D).",

A \u223c1.5 log reduction in virus progeny could be achieved in VeroE6 cells using the same dose (Fig. 2F), suggesting that ALV treatment in VeroE6 cells was twice less effective compared to Vero cells. For both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, differences in ALV sensitivity in various cell lines were observed. One explanation for such difference would be that ALV uptake differs per cell line. Interestingly, we also observed remarkable difference in e.g. SARS-CoV-induced cell death between VeroE6 and Vero cells, ranging from severe CPE in the former to minimal CPE in the latter after the same incubation period (unpublished observations). This suggests that these related cell lines can respond quite differently to virus infection.",

Nevertheless, the use of Cyp inhibitors remains a promising and innovative antiviral strategy. This class of drugs can potentially inhibit against broad range of pathogenic viruses, including hepatitis B virus (Phillips et al., 2015; EC50 of 4.1 \u03bcM), HCV (Coelmont et al., 2010, Paeshuyse et al., 2006, Puyang et al., 2010; EC50 values between 0.02 and 0.23 \u03bcM), and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (Ptak et al., 2008; EC50 values in the low-nanomolar range).

Further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of action underlying ALV\u2019s interference with coronavirus replication, as well as the involvement of Cyps in the coronavirus replication cycle. For HCV, ALV has been shown to disrupt functional interactions between cyclophilin A (CypA) and viral proteins and/or RNA (Coelmont et al., 2010, Garcia-Rivera et al., 2012, Nag et al., 2012). Interestingly, although ALV has a \u223c4 times higher affinity for CypA compared to CsA (unpublished data), the EC50 values for both inhibitors are similar, leaving the possibility that ALV and other Cyp inhibitors target CoV replication independently of CypA.",

The observed variations in EC50 values suggest that different coronaviruses may not be equally sensitive to the drug, although they may also reflect differences in e.g. experimental design, Cyp expression levels, and/or ALV uptake or turnover in different cell lines. The lack of ALV activity in the SARS-CoV animal model suggests that the drug itself may not be suited for the treatment of coronavirus infections. Nevertheless, Cyp inhibitors remain interesting leads for the development of host-directed anti-coronavirus therapy, as well as interesting tools to study the role of Cyps in coronavirus replication in more detail.",
