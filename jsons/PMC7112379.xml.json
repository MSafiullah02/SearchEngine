Among bacteria, protein A producing S. aureus has been an attractive vector for immunoassays of pathogens, especially for coagglutination tests of bacteria and viruses [3], because it is easy to conjugate IgG antibodies through protein A molecules on the surface of S. aureus cells. On the same time, biosynthesis of nanoparticles inside S. aureus cells could be exploited to enhance detection sensitivity. For example, biosynthesis of quantum dots inside S. aureus cells has been used for sensitive detection of H9N2 virus [2]. In our lab, we established a simple way to transform S. aureus into red and fluorescent nanobioprobes by reacting with a monotetrazolium redox dye, 5-cyano-2, 3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) at room temperature [4]. Comparing with the uncolored S. aureus nanobioprobes, 100 fold higher sensitivity was achieved in rapid coagglutination test of E. coli O157:H7 with the novel red nanobioprobes.",

In this study, we aim to present a simple way to conjugate antigens to the S. aureus nanobioparticles by utilizing a cell wall binding domain (CBD) from a bacteriophage lysin PlyV12, which could bind to the surface of the S. aureus nanobioparticles [5], [6]. Based on this novel design, simple agglutination tests of the IgG antibodies of Ebola virus (EBOV) nucleoprotein (NP) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) NP were successfully developed by conjugating the S. aureus nanobioparticles with two fusion proteins EBOV NP-CBD and MERS NP-CBD.",

            "text": "EBOV and MERS-CoV are highly contagious pathogens which can cause Ebola virus disease and the acute respiratory infectious disease-Middle East respiratory syndrome, respectively [7], [8]. Because until now no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines have been approved for clinical use against EBOV and MERS-CoV, rapid and specific diagnosis is essential for controlling the infections. In general, virus-specific antibodies IgM or IgG with rising titers constitute a strong presumptive detection. Therefore, detection of IgM or IgG antibodies in blood are used commonly in epidemic investigation of viral infections [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Some diagnostic methods, such as Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [9], [10], [11], [15], indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [16], [17], [18], neutralization test [12], [19], [20] and protein microarray [21], have been developed for EBOV and MERS-CoV antibody detection. However, the requirement of dedicated instruments limits the application of these assays in field, which is important for fast responses during epidemics. In comparison, agglutination test is more rapid, inexpensive, simple to interpret, and most importantly requires no specialized instrument since naked eyes could read the results [3]. Therefore, agglutination test might be a good choice for EBOV or MERS-CoV antibody detection in field. In our agglutination test, the conjugation is quite simple and could be done easily by just mixing the fusion proteins with the S. aureus nanoparticles. As far as we know, this is the first time to realize the detection of viral antibodies based on S. aureus nanoparticles.",
