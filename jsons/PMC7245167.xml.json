At present, the disease has occurred in a worldwide pandemic, is highly contagious, has a high morbidity and mortality, and has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) [2\u20134]. As of April 10, it has caused a total of 1.6 million patients, of which more than 95,000 died. The most typical symptom of COVID-19 is respiratory distress. More and more evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not always limited to the respiratory system, but can also violate the cardiovascular, digestive tract, kidney, nervous system, and reproductive systems [5\u20137]; symptoms of nervous system are divided into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms (headache, dizziness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, disturbance of consciousness, epilepsy), and peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hyposmia, taste loss, loss of appetite, neuralgia), skeletal muscle damage [8\u201313]. However, no cases related to acute cerebrovascular disease have been reported so far. This article reports a case of COVID-19 complicated with cerebral hemorrhage and summarizes the relevant treatment experience, which is now shared as follows.",

Studies have found that ACE2 is an important target for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. After infection, ACE2 levels are reduced or even absent. Therefore, it was learned that all tissues and organs expressing ACE2 may be the battlefield between SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells, eventually leading to multi-organ failure and life-threatening [17].",

Whether this is a coincidence or an inevitable correlation, the pathophysiological mechanism requires further study. As we all know, cerebral hemorrhage refers to spontaneous hemorrhage in non-traumatic brain parenchyma. Common causes are hypertension, cerebral arteriosclerosis, intracranial vascular malformation, cerebral amyloid vascular disease, hematopathy, vasculitis, etc. The vast majority of cerebral hemorrhage is manifested as small artery rupture caused by hypertension, which can cause extremely serious symptoms within a short period of time, and even affect patients\u2019 basic physiological activities such as breathing and heartbeat, resulting in death. It is a common acute cerebrovascular disease in middle-aged and elderly people, with a high fatality and disability rate [18]. The patient had no history of hypertension, sudden cerebral hemorrhage, and no vascular abnormalities such as aneurysms during the operation. Is the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage in patients related to the consumption of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2?",

However, in combination with the patient\u2019s high fever, lymphocytopenia, increased neutrophils, and poor anti-bacterial treatment effect, the clinical manifestations conform to the COVID-19 characteristics, and nucleic acid detection is required. As is known to all, nucleic acid detection is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the first test result is negative, which is related to the low positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 detection using fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR as the detection method, currently only 30 to 50%, leading to an extremely high false negative rate [19]. Because the test results are affected by a variety of factors, including: in vivo viral load, whether the specimen is qualified, whether the transport conditions meet the standards, whether the specimen is contaminated by RNA enzymes resulting in nucleic acid degradation, etc. The patient obtained a positive result on the second test and was eventually diagnosed with COVID-19. Therefore, we believe that the standardized collection and transportation of specimens and repeated testing are conducive to the improvement of positive rate, early diagnosis and early treatment.",

Respiratory failure is the main cause of death, followed by sepsis (multiple organ failure), heart failure, bleeding, and kidney failure. The affected organs mainly include the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, coagulation function, and the liver and the kidney. In many cases, multiple organ functions are impaired. Through the study of death cases, it was found that in addition to directly attacking human tissues and organs, SARS-CoV-2 caused a cytokine storm by stimulating the human immune system. Many patients with severe COVID-19 will develop cytokine storm, which is an over-immune response of the human body. The main reason is the over-activation of non-specific immune cells, which release a large number of pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor. [23]. Therefore, it is suggested that clinicians should take a two-pronged approach to severely ill patients with COVID-19, in addition to paying special attention to the protection of organ function, but also need to strengthen the control of cytokine storm.",
