Based on the antigenic difference of the virus nucleocapsid protein (NP), infl uenza viruses are classifi ed into types A, B, and C (Table 21 .1 ). Infl uenza virus is an RNA virus, which is most stable in an environment with a pH value of 6.5-7.9 and has weak resistance to heat. It loses its pathogenicity at a temperature of 56 \u00b0C for several minutes and is inactivated at a temperature of 100 \u00b0C for 1 min. Infl uenza virus is more stable in an environment of low temperature. It can survive for more than 1 month at 4 \u00b0C and for more than 5 months at \u221270 \u00b0C. Infl uenza virus is sensitive to dryness, ultraviolet radiation, ethanol, iodine, and other common disinfectants. Rapid mutation and evolution are its main features, which is the result of antigenic structural changes in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, particularly hemagglutinin. Each variation of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase continually combines to form new mutant strains, and a new strain may defeat the established immunity against the former strain. Only when the population immunity is compromised to a certain level can the new strain likely invade the susceptible populations to cause an outbreak. This is the main reason for recurrent pandemics of infl uenza. Signifi cant variation commonly occurs in infl uenza A virus, but rarely in infl uenza B virus and none in infl uenza C virus.",

Infl uenza B commonly occurs in outbreaks or small-scale epidemics and infl uenza C occurs sporadically. Infl uenza has a sudden onset and spreads rapidly.

The lesions are basically diffusive damages to pulmonary capillaries with increased permeability. The pathological changes mainly include pulmonary emphysema, formation of hyaline membrane, and pulmonary atelectasis. And clinically it is characterized by progressive respiratory distress and intractable hypoxemia, which are typical manifestations of acute pulmonary lesions in the advanced stage. The radiological demonstrations of ARDS are related to leakage of edema fl uid containing a large quantity of proteins to fi ll in the alveolar cavity because of damaged alveolar epithelial cells or diffusively destructed alveolar walls. Chest X-ray commonly demonstrates diffusively distributed shadows in both lungs and characteristic radiological changes of basic diseases such as severe pneumonia caused by various pathogens. CT scanning demonstrates unevenly distributed lesions, including (1) normal or nearly normal gravity-independent area (mainly the anterior chest in supine position), (2) ground-glass opacity at the anterior and middle regions, and (3) consolidation shadow in the gravity-dependent area. In the cases with no lesions in the pulmonary capillary membrane, the patches of shadows in both lungs are evenly distributed, with no gravity dependency and no gravity-dependent change after changing body posture, which facilitates the differentiation from pulmonary infectious diseases. The advanced manifestations of ARDS include twisted bronchi and traction of bronchi and shrinkage of pulmonary segment or lobe volume, with grid-like shadow, cord-like shadow, and honeycomb-like shadow. In serious cases, honeycomb-like lung occurs.",
