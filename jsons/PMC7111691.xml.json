The fission process of the mitochondria is mediated by mitochondrial translocation of cytosolic dynamin related protein-1 (Drp-1). The recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria is regulated by phosporylation of respective serine residues and are specifically modulated by mitochondrial outer membrane proteins like mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1), mitochondria fission factor (Mff) [2,3]. Mitochondrial dynamics is tightly regulated in response to variations in cellular physiology such as stress, infections, and nutrient supply [4].",

Localized to the mitochondria, MAVS coordinates the IFN production through regulated signaling cascades [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. Studies have shown that many viral proteins enhance mitochondrial fission and compromise the host immune response by preventing MAVS signaling and the majority of the mammalian viruses escape the host IFN response by targeting the MAVS [[9], [10], [11], [12]]. The IFN response escape strategy used by many of the aquatic viruses are still unclear, even though, studies demonstrated that the N protein of spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) degrades Zebra fish MAVS [13,14].",

RNA1 encodes an approximately 100 kDa non-structural protein that has been designated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or protein A. Nodavirus synthesize a sub-genomic RNA3 from the 3\u2032 terminus of RNA1 during RNA replication which encode a B2 protein which plays a role in silencing host RNA interference [15]. Betanodavirus predominantly infect fish causing viral nervous necrosis (VNN), an infectious neuropathological disease characterized by necrosis of the central nervous system and retina [16]. VNN can induce massive death of the larval and juvenile populations of several marine teleost species including Asian seabass in India accounting for a larger mortality rate. Despite their severe economic impact on the aquaculture industry, the viral molecular regulation processes and the mechanism(s) of viral pathogenesis and infection of NNV have not been well studied. Oxidative stress and presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by NNV was observed in previous studies [17,18]. Studies of Su et al. [19] reported that B2 protein of NNV increases the production of hydrogen peroxide and leads to Drp-1 activation invitro. In this study, we investigated the involvement of mitochondrial fission in the attenuation of RLR downstream signaling during NNV infection.",

For studying the oxidative injury in NNV infected cells, we detected the mitochondrial superoxide production with MitoSOX\u2122 Red, a mitochondrially localized, superoxide-sensitive fluorescent ROS indicator. As demonstrated in Fig. 1\n, NNV infection in the cells resulted in greater mitochondrial superoxide production compared with control in a time dependent manner. Studies have demonstrated that damaged mitochondria are potential source to initiate a vicious cycle of ROS generation and deteriorate other cellular components promoting cell death [22]. Concurrent with the present observations, HCV core protein resulted in the Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial ROS production and inhibited complex I activity in Huh7 cells [23,24]. NNV infection induced oxidative stress has been reported in turbot brain, and the presence of ROS in GF-1 cells at an early stage of infection (24 h post infection, h.p.i.) induced cell death by affecting mitochondrial morphology [17,18]. As shown in Fig. 2\n, NNV-infected cells displayed distinct fragmented mitochondria (mitochondrial fission), in contrast to un-infected cells, which displayed a typical tubular mitochondrial network indicative of normal healthy cells. A similar result was also observed in Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [[25], [26], [27]].",

            "text": "The physiologic regulators such as mitochondrial morphology, dynamics and mitochondrial ROS also play a major role in mitochondria mediated antiviral signaling [28,29]. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) are being recognized as both positive and negative modulators of RLR signaling. NOX2 and ROS are reported to have a major role for triggering the host cell for efficient MAVS signaling [30]. However in the present study, as the mitochondrial ROS and fragmentation increased significantly in a time dependent manner, transcript abundance and protein expression of MAVS have shown considerable depletion in the cells (Fig. 3\n). Further, gene expression analysis of MAVS downstream molecules viz, IRF-3, IFN-1 and Mx have shown the significant down regulation in the mRNA transcript levels (Fig. 3C). The majority of the mammalian viruses escape the host IFN response by targeting the MAVS. In case of hepatitis C virus, enterovirus71, GBvirusB and the coxsackievirus B3, their NS3/4A serine protease, protease2Apro NS3/4A serine protease and cysteine protease 3Cpro respectively cleaves MAVS [[9], [10], [11], [12]]. Studies demonstrated that the N protein of spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) degrades Zebra fish MAVS by E3 ligase(s) mediated K48-linked ubiquitination [13,14]. In Contrast to these, the influenza A virus, oncolytic measles virus and the SARS corona virus dampens MAVS signaling by perturbing the mitochondrial physiology [[31], [32], [33]]. Thus the exact mechanism of MAVS depletion in the cells post infection with NNV needs to be addressed with more studies.",

            "text": "Ser616 phosphorylation of Drp-1 by cyclin B/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) recruits them to mitochondria and drive the fission process [34]. To understand whether NNV induces mitochondrial fission by promoting Drp1 Ser616 phosphorylation and its subsequent translocation to mitochondria, NNV-infected cells were analyzed by using a anti-Drp1 antibody that recognizes the Ser616-phosphorylated Drp1. Confocal microscopy revealed a significant stimulation of Drp1 Ser616 phosphorylation in NNV-infected cells and most of the Ser616 phosphorylated Drp1 localized to the mitochondria (Fig. 4\nA). To conclude the observation that NNV induced Drp1 translocation to mitochondria, western blot analysis of mitochondrial fractions demonstrated that phosphorylated Drp1 is associated with mitochondria (Fig. 4B). Further real time expression studies stated that NNV infection increased the expression of Drp1 and Mff at mRNA level but the transcript abundance of Fis 1 remained stagnant throughout the infection (Fig. 4C). These results were in concordance with previous studies of HBV, HCV and PRSSV thus suggesting that NNV promoted Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria by stimulating Ser616 phosphorylation. To substantiate the functional role of Drp 1in mitochondrial fission, the siRNA mediated silencing of Drp 1 expression was performed. As shown in Fig. 5\nA, intracellular viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) was decreased in Drp 1deficient cells indicating the functional role of Drp1in mitochondrial fission. In similar studies on hepatitis C virus, classical swine fever virus and dengue virus, silencing of Drp1 had shown significant reduction in the viral replication as in the present study [25,35,36]. The transcript abundance of MAVS and its downstream molecules have also shown significant upregulation in Drp 1 deficient cells (Fig. 5C and D).Western blot analysis of mitochondrial fraction of NNV infected Drp 1 deficient cells shown high abundance of MAVS on mitochondria as the infection progress (Fig. 5B).",
