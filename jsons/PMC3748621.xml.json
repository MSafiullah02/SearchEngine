The systems biology paradigm requires the integration of numerous components to successfully interrogate and evaluate the connectivity that exists between biological and genomic information (Fig. \n1). Merging massive biological and clinical correlates with mathematical and computational modeling followed by validation and extension represents one of the most challenging aspects of the systems biology approach. Building a multidisciplinary team of independent researchers provides a means to rapidly integrate these different disciplines; however, the process is intrinsically difficult and requires dedicated effort and continuous interaction. For example, mathematical modeling often can exclude 99% of possible targets, leaving 1% for examination; yet for transcriptional datasets, this can result in >1000 possible gene targets which prove unmanageable for testing and validation. Similarly, the absence of mock treatments or sufficient sample numbers greatly reduces the power and utility of any modeling algorithm. In each case, consistent communication is required to harmonize key issues in study that maintain experimental and statistical rigor as well as model performance. In our experience, constant dialog through multimedia channels, and more importantly, via face\u2010to\u2010face meetings provides an essential dynamic for developing coordinated experimental and modeling platforms that maintain statistical rigor, inform across disciplines, and promote key relationships for program performance. Without this underlying foundation, the systems biology paradigm would ultimately fail to produce any useful insights into biological functions.",

Examples include difference in global transcription at early/intermediate/late time points 17, changes to overall lethality (18), and variation in functional gene subsets across different viral pathogens (19, Menachery VD, Eisfeld AJ, Josset L, Sims AC, Schaefer A, Proll S, Fan S, Li C, Neumann G, Tilton SC, Chang J, Gralinski LE, Long C, Green R, Matzke MM, Webb\u2010Robertson BJ, Shukula AK, Burkett S, Metz TO, Pickles R, Smith RD, Waters KM, Katze MG, Kawaoka Y, Baric RS, in review).

The purpose of this is to generate data and targets that are not biased by the previous knowledge base. Although this premise is critically important for experimental design and data acquisition, target generation is inherently a biased approach. In the systems biology landscape, the bias is typically toward mathematical models built upon expansive biological databases; this methodology allows generation of novel targets independent of the previous knowledge bases. However, this approach discounts the prior experimental understanding and fails to utilize it in refining targets. Therefore, after the generation of unbiased gene sets that discriminate between different biological stimuli (e.g. different viruses, mutants, age, dose), we sought to incorporate known correlates into our modeling to refine and produce better targets for confirmation and validation studies. An example of this approach is integration of a known viral protein function or analysis of a process shown to be important to the infection. In addition, observation from broad systems\u2010based studies can also be utilized to refine the predictive model. In this way, we are able to improve the quality of target selection for downstream validation studies.",

Often, the numerous targets make it nearly impossible to adequately demonstrate validation of the broad pathways identified. However, the first two tenets of our systems biology approach begin to address this scope issue. To fully address this criticism, our group began by making a distinction between confirmation and validation. Confirmation, for our purposes, is verification of the same biological output by a different method or in a different experimental condition. For example, array data generated from a cell line can be confirmed by either real\u2010time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of targeted genes or by repeating the experiment in an independent culture system. In contrast, validation occurs when initial findings are verified with a different biological output. For example, RNA expression data can be validated by proteomics and/or immunohistochemical staining. Together, confirmation and validation are paramount in our systems biology approach and are necessary to provide robust verification of systems\u2010based targets. Therefore, we have added increased emphasis to this area to allow pursuit of further studies through both iterative studies and the approach outlined in our final tenet.",

In this way, systems biology can produce novel insights, identify complex interactions, validate targets, and continuously add to our biological understanding of infectious disease. However, this process requires significant capital in terms of both time and resources. Importantly, continuation of the iterative cycle may not extend the observed finding, but rather identify new areas to explore. Therefore, our group examined ways to extend system biology findings beyond the iterative cycle by using standard reductionist techniques. Typically, these experiments query mechanistic aspects, seeking to identify required viral components or molecular processes involved in protective or pathogenic response and disease outcomes. Examples include studies of functional assays, identification of structural motifs, and/or utilization of knockout animals. Together, this approach effectively provides a second level of validation and provides similar outputs as reductionist\u2010based studies. In addition, these types of analysis can be programmed into the iterative cycle of systems biology and provide the perturbation necessary for the next round of data generation.",

Utilizing overexpression systems, functional assays, and a variety of viral mutants, numerous RNA and DNA virus proteins have been characterized by reductionist approaches, leading to important biological findings and translational products like vaccines and therapeutics. These proteins have primarily been associated with either the viral life cycle (viral polymerases, structural proteins, etc.) or viral\u2013host interaction like immune antagonism. However, due to their limited genetic capacity, RNA viruses typically encode multifunctional proteins that perform numerous processes beyond the scope of viral replication or immune evasion. Often, identifying these additional processes may be very difficult to reveal using traditional reductionist approaches. In these situations, systems biology provides an opportunity to utilize detailed experimental data to predict and identify novel roles for viral proteins.

Although non\u2010essential for in vitro replication, initial screens quickly identified ORF6 as an interferon antagonist 23. Subsequent experiments established that ORF6 interfered with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling via binding karyopherin \u03b12, trapping both the import factor and its partner in complex karyopherin \u03b2125, 26. The resulting block prevented STAT1 nuclear localization and interfered with induction of the antiviral state within the host. However, despite its role in antagonizing the type I interferon (IFN) response, mutant SARS\u2010CoV lacking ORF6 (\u0394ORF6) grows to titers equivalent to WT in both IFN competent (CALU3) and incompetent cells (Vero) 21. Similarly, type I IFN pretreatment has only a modest impact on viral replication of \u0394ORF6, resulting in reduced titers similar to WT SARS\u2010CoV (data not shown). These results argued that the absence of ORF6 is complemented by the myriad of other SARS\u2010CoV IFN antagonist 27. However, in vivo infection revealed significant attenuation of \u0394ORF6 pathogenesis; notably, this attenuation did not extend to viral titers within the lung.

Modeling the data with a focus on gene ontology confirmed augmented expression of antiviral genes. However, the results also revealed stark differences in terms of nuclear signaling, cell proliferation, cell cycle, as well as metabolic processes, and demonstrated a role for ORF6 beyond just IFN antagonism. Additional analysis filtered the dataset by the known ability of ORF6 to inhibit karyopherin\u2010based transport; the resulting modeling revealed important transcriptional hubs that play a critical role in differential regulation of cellular processes. These hubs, which include CREB1, VDR, and p53, were then confirmed in primary human airway epithelial cultures (HAE) and validated using both proteomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches. Together, the results suggested that in addition to IFN antagonism, ORF6 regulates several karyopherin\u2010dependent transcriptional hubs and alters host cell processes that impact SARS\u2010CoV pathogenesis.",

In addition, these areas may provide ORF6\u2010based targets for therapeutic development of vaccine and drug treatments that may be effective against SARS and other CoVs. Similarly, Creb1 and p53 have been implicated in impacting influenza pathogenesis, and therapeutics may also have efficacy against IAV 28, 29, 30, 31.

Together, these studies illustrate a trend that has implications on future systems\u2010based analysis of viral proteins. As mentioned previously, one tenet of our approach focuses on contrasts within the system. Using \u0394ORF6 studies as a template 21, mutants with ablated viral protein activity can be examined and compared with WT virus to quickly identify differential host gene expression. These host responses can then be modeled to determine broad differences based on gene ontology, pathway disruption, or a variety of other transcription\u2010based categorizations. This type of analysis provides a window into the possible functions of a specific viral protein and an avenue to begin further studies. Notably, known functions derived from reductionist approaches can also be integrated into the modeling which provides both refined targeting as well as incorporating the second tenet of our systems\u2010based approach. Next, identified targets can be confirmed and validated by a variety of approaches including proteomics analysis, drug treatments, or knock\u2010down studies to demonstrate functional significance in vitro.

However, these doses sharply diverge in terms of weight loss at late time points and overall lethality. This contrast provided an opportunity to explore pathways and networks that were different between lethal and sublethal disease. To incorporate these biological data, we utilized a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA); this approach uses underlying correlation structures to partition gene expression into modules not biased by existing knowledge bases 37. Connectivity inferred by WGCNA is a strong predictor of biological function, and the most highly connected hub genes provide candidate mediators of disease that have been used in a variety of fields including cancer, plant, and genetics 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. Gene ontology analysis of this module revealed a strong categorization for extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and wound healing pathways.

A similar approach has also been used to identify and validate other networks that regulate SARS\u2010CoV and IAV pathogenesis in vivo; these include complement components (18) as well as TNFRSF1b\n14 and Kepi1 (McDermott JE, Gralinski LE , Eisfeld AJ, Mitchell HD, Bankhead A, Josset L, Tchitchek N, Chang J, Neumann G, Tilton SC, Li C, Fan S, Sch\u00e4fer A, McWeeney S, Kawaoka Y, Baric RS, Waters KM , Katze MG, in review).

Systems virology datasets alleviated these problems and permit analysis beyond a single treatment or infection condition. Therefore, in lieu of the typical unbiased modeling approach, we incorporated a network with known biological importance to virus infection: type I IFN and ISGs. Type I IFN induces a signaling cascade that arms immune defenses and serve to provide the first line of defense against viral pathogens 51, 52. Upon binding through the type I IFN receptor, IFN signaling initiates transcription of hundreds of ISGs that have antiviral, immune modulatory, and cell regulatory functions. Expression of these genes within host cells renders an inhospitable antiviral state critical to limiting viral infection in vitro and in vivo. While several prominent ISGs such as Mx, PKR, and OAS have been studied in depth, the vast majority have never been fully evaluated. However, the ISGs impact on viral infection is clear; in the absence of the type I IFN cascade, the host fails to mount effective immune responses and becomes very susceptible to viral challenge 53. Successful viral pathogens, including SARS\u2010CoV and IAV, have developed means to overcome specific IFN and ISG effector functions 27, 54, 55. Globally, ISGs as a class have broad functions beyond just direct viral antagonism including increased MHC class I and II expression, augmented immune infiltration and trafficking, and host protein shutoff 51. These processes can impede viral replication and pathogenesis; therefore, viruses likely attempt to short circuit global ISG induction, potentially through different means.",

Using RNA expression data, we asked and confirmed that ISG delay following SARS\u2010CoV was primarily due to delayed type I IFN production. Modeling downstream gene expression patterns, we also determined that H5N1\u2010VN1203 did not target transcriptional factors to mediate ISG antagonism. Next, we utilized RNA expression patterns to identify target genes for differential histone modification. The resulting experiment confirmed that H5N1\u2010VN1203 mediated incorporation of a repressive histone modification in the 5\u2032 untranslated region of downregulated ISGs; this modification was absent in upregulated ISGs. Having established a role for epigenetic regulation in the ISG antagonism, we next sought to identify the involved viral components. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, a statistical technique to visualize similarities and differences between datasets, revealed informative insights for both SARS\u2010CoV and IAV infection (Fig. \n4). MDS analysis comparing ISG expression following WT and \u0394ORF6 SARS\u2010CoV infection demonstrated little contrast between the two, suggesting a limited role for ORF6 in global ISG antagonism. In contrast, MDS analysis of H5N1 mutants revealed NS1 truncation resulted in closer alignment with H1N1\u2010CA04 ISG expression than WT; PB1 and PB2 mutants had some change, but aligned closer to the WT. Subsequent experiments revealed that NS1 truncation ablated ISG downregulation and no incorporation of the repressive histone marker. These findings suggest that epigenetic regulation via NS1, in addition to interference with sensing/signaling, contributes to IAV control of the type I IFN response. Together, these results established novel mechanistic insights into ISG antagonism by both SARS\u2010CoV and IAV.",

Derived from eight founder lines, the CC provides extensive variation [47 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and 4 million insertions/deletions, on the same order as those observed in the human genome], high reproducibility of genetically identical mouse lines, and customization via inbred intercrosses. Screening infectious disease outcomes in this resource provides the opportunity to understand how genetic variation within a population affects the host response to viral infection. Importantly, the CC is powerful enough to untangle the role of monogenic and oligogenetic traits in complex disease phenotypes by providing a diverse range of independent readouts ideal for modeling areas like inflammation, innate immunity, and lymphocyte responses 67. For example, SARS\u2010CoV infection in the founder lines results in dramatically divergent disease outcomes ranging from mild respiratory and clinical disease symptoms (<5% weight loss) to fulminant lethal disease in 2 or 3 days and a wide range in lethal doses ranging from <102 to >106, depending on the line (data not shown).

Similarly, the expansion of systems biology also led to the development and application of new modeling paradigms based on statistical tests (Fischer's summary statistic), module mapping (WGCNA), and fold\u2010change z\u2010score (CLR). However, for the most part, these modeling systems existed in isolation interacting primarily with simple datasets and experimental conditions. Advancement of systems\u2010based modeling requires integration of these high\u2010throughput datasets, varying experimental systems, and novel mathematical approaches.",

            "text": "Several groups, including ours, have sought to meld these diverse aspects to develop models that refine and enhance targets for validation and confirmation within systems biology. One approach utilizes different high\u2010throughput data types to generate common, refined targets. For example, our SARS\u2010\u0394ORF6 studies utilized CLR\u2010based modeling of both transcriptomics and proteomic data to identify transcriptional hubs regulated by karyopherins; this approach narrowed the targets and provided manageable validation avenues. Another approach seeks to examine modeling approaches across experimental systems with common biological stimuli. Studies with IAV H5N1 exemplify this approach as conservation of network modeling was observed between varying in vitro and in vivo models for interferon responses, inflammasome, and hypercytokinemia 73. A third approach attempts to bridge varying mathematical and computational approaches to yield a more complete picture of complex biological systems. Using this method, our group combined CLR\u2010based analysis with WGCNA module mapping to create a blended model system that helped to identify important regulators influencing pathogenesis including Tnfrsf1b and Kepi1 (JE McDermott, LE Gralinski, AJ Eisfeld, HD Mitchell, A. Bankhead, L Josset, N Tchitchek, J Chang, G Neumann, SC Tilton, C Li, S Fan, A Sch\u00e4fer, S McWeeney, Y Kawaoka, RS Baric, KM Waters, MG Katz, in review). Another example generated meta\u2010analysis from SARS\u2010CoV, IAVs H5N1\u2010VN1203, and H1N1\u20101918 infection data at multiple doses using statistical tests, module mapping, and z\u2010score\u2013based analysis 74. The study suggested that increased magnitude, rather than differential gene expression, drove differences in host damage between low and high pathogenic infection conditions. Together, these studies illustrate simple steps taken toward integrating aspects of the modeling approaches; however, significant advancement is still necessary as systems biology research moves forward.",

With the development and incorporation of numerous new high\u2010throughput data sources including the CC, the next leap in model design must move beyond single and dual input analysis. Incorporating multiple biological parameters is required to understand complex biological systems involved during infectious disease pathogenesis. Along with developing new models for areas like whole\u2010body plethysmography, immune infiltration, and metabolomics, systems biology teams must devote significant resources toward integrating these models with other output measures. In addition, incorporation of multiple modeling approaches will help refine and advance the responses; new algorithms like the inferelator and cross\u2010validation approaches provide a blueprint to these advances 61, 75. Similarly, modeling approaches including discriminant analysis via mixed integer programming or principal component analysis have been utilized by other systems biology groups with great success and could be combined with our approaches to produce more robust models of disease 14, 15. In addition, efforts to \u2018train\u2019 the modeling approaches are underway, utilizing known biological signatures and datasets to help refine and improve targeting in similar, yet unknown conditions. For example, studies with SARS\u2010CoV mutants lacking NSP16 have defined important pathways independent of any modeling approach (Menachery VD, Eisfeld AJ, Josset L, Sims AC, Schaefer A, Proll S, Fan S, Li C, Neumann G, Tilton SC, Chang J, Gralinski LE, Long C, Green R, Matzke MM, Webb\u2010Robertson BJ, Shukula AK, Burkett S, Metz TO, Pickles R, Smith RD, Waters KM, Katze MG, Kawaoka Y, Baric RS, in review); these data were then used to screen the efficacy of newly developed models to examine other mutant viruses with similar infection kinetics. A similar approach was utilized in examination of influenza vaccine responses 15. Together, these efforts are just a few of the ways that systems\u2010based modeling can be refined to provide efficient, effective targeting. While significant commitment is needed for this possibility to come to fruition, the resulting models would provide an opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of complex biological systems.",

            "text": "Reductionist\u2010based validation approaches often rely on knock\u2010out and overexpression studies to provide understanding, using the absence or overabundance of a molecule as a means to define its function. However, these types of null genetic mutation are rarely observed in nature, making it difficult to directly translate these finding into human disease models. For validation to have a translational impact on human disease, our studies must use genetic diversity to alter target gene/pathways functions rather than knock\u2010out or knock\u2010down studies. The CC allows this type of analysis through generation of customizable recombinant inbred intercrosses 76, 77. For example, studies with SARS\u2010CoV have identified Serpine1, a key component of the urokinase pathway and an important player in tissue damage/repair following infection. Serpine1 deficiency results in enhanced disease and pathogenesis following SARS\u2010CoV infection, likely due to increased lung pathology (18). However, the impact of these data remains unclear with regards to human disease: the vast majority of people maintain functional Serpine1, but genetic diversity in this gene or region of the genome may have a significant impact on pathogenic outcomes and disease severity. To assay this possibility, we can utilize the CC to generate mouse lines with allelic diversity in this region of the genome, while maintaining genetic identity throughout the rest of the genome (Fig. \n5\nA). Similarly, the genome region could remain static and the background shifted to assess the impact of a specific allele. For Serpine1 in the CC, this means the possibility of examining the impact of six haplotypes during in vivo infection (Fig. \n5\nB). Importantly, other analysis can be layered onto the CC RIX experimental model including predictions based on SNP consequences (Fig. \n5\nC), structural alterations 78 (Fig. \n5\nD), and/or epigenetic regulatory factors. In addition, multiple genes could be analyzed in parallel to assay their allelic impact on each other; while either holding constant or randomizing the majority of the genome, allelic variants can be shuffled between the two gene regions, creating combinations to assay their interaction with each other and the global response (Fig. \n5\nA). For example, systems vaccinology has identified important genes impacting the antibody response (TNFRS17 & CaMKIV) and T\u2010cell response (EIF2AK4 & C1QB) following yellow fever and influenza vaccination 15. Using the CC, the varying allele combinations could be examined in the same background and provide a window into the interactions of different gene combinations and pathways.",

Notably, for systems biology targets, the CC allows validation of genes and pathways without the requirement of previously generated reagents alleviating one of the major issues with validation. Because the CC is based on natural genetic variation rather than genetic deletions, this resource also allows for investigations into the role of genes that cannot be knocked out or knocked down in traditional validation approaches.

Drug targets effective in these areas would be further tested in inbred models of infection for in vivo efficacy.

Detailed transcriptomic analysis of SARS\u2010CoV and EMC2012 host response networks had demonstrated early upregulated genes (approximately 200) that are downstream of p38 map kinase signaling pathways. A systematic review of the FDA database indicated that SB203580, a pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor of p38 mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase, significantly downregulated overlapping sets of genes that are induced by high path coronaviruses 80. To test compound effectiveness, we infected Vero cells with SARS\u2010CoV at a MOI of 0.01 and then treated cells with type I IFN or SB203580. Importantly, SB203580 significantly reduced both EMC\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV growth (and CPE) in culture, and in some cases, was equivalent to IFN treatment, supporting our hypothesis that lead compounds for therapeutic testing and evaluation can be identified by modeling approaches that compare contrasting expression patterns during infection and drug treatment. Further testing in tissue\u2010specific cells and in vivo continues for SB203580, but the data illustrate conceptual support for this approach. A similar method is planned for other systems biology targets suggesting that identified drugs may enhance protective responses mitigated by the Urokinase pathway (e.g. protein kinase C) or stimulate the TLR3/TLR4/myd88 signaling pathways (e.g. TLR3\u2010 PolyIC, Poly AU, TLR4\u2010Monophosphoryl lipid A) 80, protecting against lethal disease.",
