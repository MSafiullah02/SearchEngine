UGS are increasingly seen as a potential solution for sustainable urban planning and development. Informal green spaces (IGS), even though they J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f may make up a large share of UGS, are often overlooked in this regard. This study examines residents' awareness of the ecosystem services provided by IGS and their need for redevelopment. The data were collected through structured interviews in the immediate vicinity of selected IGS in the Polish city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is typical of post-industrial European cities struggling with environmental (heatwaves, cloudbursts), social (aging, depopulation) and spatial (a neglected and dense city center) issues. Our results show that residents saw IGS as places able to provide a range of services, mostly of the regulating type, and even minor design interventions can improve the attractiveness of IGS. Taking this into account, we conclude that IGS are important vegetated areas in the city, which can be complementary to formal greenery.",

The most commonly desired UGSurban parks and forestsare frequently not sufficient to meet the demand for services due to their location (usually the outskirts of city centers, or even in suburban areas) or limited size or location options, hence the role of alternative green areas has been highlighted, e.g.",

Such places are referred to as informal green spaces (IGS). Although they are defined in various ways, in general they are all neglected areas which are not formally recognized or planned for recreational use by inhabitants (Rupprecht & Bryne, 2014a,b; Pietrzyk-Kaszy\u0144ska et al., 2017) .

IGS have been considered even less frequently (e.g. Weber et al., 2014; Mathey et al., 2018 ; Table   1 ., Appendix A). Little is also known about the needs of local residents in terms of redevelopment of IGS (Mathey et al., 2018) . As the attractiveness of the space plays an important role in how people consider the value of greenery, the perception of IGS can be highly diverse. They are perceived as problematic areas which are aesthetically undervalued (e.g. unpleasant spaces, perceived as a landfill or a source of social problems) (Brun et al., 2018) , untidy and dangerous due to the structure of the vegetation (Jorgensen et al., 2007; Mathey et al., 2018) . Conversely, some people see IGS as useful, valuable, highly natural spaces (Brun et al., 2018) , characterized by wildness, uniqueness (Pietrzyk-Kaszy\u0144ska et al., 2017) , biodiversity, and tranquility (Rupprecht et al., 2015) . This paper focuses on IGS in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (central Poland). The aim was to investigate i) the attractiveness and uses of UGS not intended for recreation, ii) the awareness of ecosystem services provided by IGS, iii) conservation vs. redevelopment of IGS, and iv) favorable uses and management of such sites as a basis for planning decisions and policy intervention.

The central zone is mainly home to low-income and unemployed residents, while the upper and middle classes tend to live outside the old core of the city. This is due to the fact that instead of allocating funds to the reconstruction and revitalization of the pre-war housing stock during the communist period (after the Second World War), efforts were instead focused on building vast residential areas on the outskirts of the city (Marci\u0144czak & Sagan, 2010) . This has led to a societal degradation of the city center and to collapse of its physical attributes (Marci\u0144czak & Sagan, 2010) . The differences between the city center and its outskirts are also reflected in the health of residents of different zones, e.g. children from the center have a significantly lower body mass and height (Rosset et al., 2012) . A similar effect can be noted for the prevalence of asthma in both adults and children, as well as seasonal rhinitis in children (Kupry\u015b & Kuna, 2003; Kupry\u015b et al., 2009 Kupry\u015b et al., , 2010 .",

According to Sikorska et al. (in press) , this statistic also includes arable land, private greenery and unmanaged green spaces, which account for 85.43% of all vegetated areas. Consequently, only a minority of residents have access to highquality managed greenery.

According to the same studies, 77% of those citizens who do not have formal green spaces in their surroundings do have access to IGS. The location of formal green areas in the vicinity of city residents, a high proportion of greenery not being included in urban green space planning and governance, and unequal access to greenery, all make \u0141\u00f3d\u017a an important location for analyzing the benefits and management options of IGS.",

Preliminary studies were carried out in 40 IGS. Fenced sites, those with limited access, and those located within housing estates were excluded. In total, five locations were selected for further research (Table 2 ., Fig. 1 ). Most of the sites were located in or adjacent to the low income areas of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a with a predominance of tenement houses (only the fifth location is outside the degraded area, but the poverty and unemployment rates are similar, the difference is manifested mostly in the predominance of blocks of flats over tenement houses). The majority of inhabitants do not have access to private and community gardens, nor formal green areas of appropriate quality and size with adequate infrastructure in close distance. Two of them represented street greenery (with and without trees, with low levels of maintenance) and three abandoned, derelict sites at different succession phases (with spontaneous pioneer or ruderal vegetation, no maintenance). All sites were selected as the biggest green patches within the neighborhood, and due to proximity of housing. ",

This bias is unfortunate because urban foraging could be an important and widely accessible way of handling environmentally-friendly production and transport of food, and tackling social issues such as poverty (Russo et al., 2017; Shackleton et al., 2017; Landor-Yamagata et al., 2018) . More information may be needed on the subject, including issues favoring the development of IGS J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f which may provide food provisioning, for example by introducing natural barriers to pollution (e.g. planting trees along the street (Al-Dabbous & Kumar, 2014) ).",

In our study, respondents showed a high awareness of ecosystem services of IGS; this is related not only to their age or education, but also to the features of the site (e.g. tree coverage, management level). However, socio-demographic factors appear to be statistically related with just three UES: aesthetic function, mental health benefits and noise reduction. The aesthetic function of IGS was more highly recognized by younger and highly educated people. Elderly respondents were more likely to recognize the positive influence of IGS on mental health and noise reduction. This could be related to generational variance and age-related needs, which is linked with a higher physical and mental vulnerability of the elderly. The findings are concordant with those by Van den Berg and Van Winsum-Westra (2010) and Van den Berg and Kole, (2006) , where people with an academic education rated wild spaces as more beautiful, and elderly people displayed relatively high preferences for managed natural settings.

Additionally, street greenery protects against pluvial flooding (through retention of rainwater), which is a highly recognized problem in densely built-up city centers during rain events (Wagner & Zalewski, 2009 ). The answers indicated that the presence of trees on land parcels is particularly associated with noise reduction, temperature regulation and air purification, which may be due to the responders' beliefs/feelings or the increasing availability and accessibility of scientific evidence. The findings are directly in line with research which provides evidence that urban trees reduce heat stress (Bowler et al., 2010) , noise levels (Nowak & Dwyer, 2007) and air pollutants (Nowak & Dwyer, 2007; Escobedo et al., 2011; Nowak et al., 2014) . Furthermore, the presence of trees is related to respondents recognizing mental health benefits of IGS, which confirms findings of other studies (Gerstenberg & Hofmann, 2016) .

Another suggested change, almost as popular as improved orderliness, was to improve the functionality of IGS, for example by adding benches or delineation of walking paths; this is concordant with results obtained by Unt & Bell (2014) , who showed that the number of users increased when a few pieces of equipment were set in an urban wilderness.

As a result, they proposed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f solutions that would improve the safety of the site, which did not always include removing greenery and changing its wild appearance. Instead, they suggested for example, frequent inspections by city authorities or municipal police. The problem of perceived safety risks in IGS is widespread and recognized in literature (\u00d6zg\u00fcner & Kendle, 2006; Jorgensen et al., 2007; Rink & Arndt, 2016) . The reasons given include dense, unmanaged vegetation, which translates into short viewing distances (Bixler & Floyd, 1997; Schroeder & Anderson, 1983) , where vegetation interferes with surveillance (Jorgensen et al., 2002) . This can be conducive to antisocial behavior such as dumping rubbish, violence, harassment and drug/alcohol consumption (Rink & Arndt, 2016; Rall & Haase, 2011) . Several studies suggest that even minor maintenance interventions such as trimming vegetation (Rall & Haase, 2011; Unt & Bell, 2014) can reduce the perception of danger (\u00d6zg\u00fcner & Kendle, 2006; Lindemann-Matthies & Brieger, 2016) .",

Greenery in cities can help to cool the environment through evapotranspiration and shade provision (Bowler et al., 2010; Kleerekoper et al., 2012; Djeki\u0107 et al., 2018) , reduce noise nuisance (Li et al., 2010; Dzhambov & Dimitrova, 2015; Van Renterghem & Botteldooren 2016) , and filter particulate matter from polluted air (Popek et al., 2013; Przybysz et al., 2019) . Almost 84.5% of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a residents have highly limited access to any formal UGS. This has a twofold effect: it places existing high-quality green areas at risk of invasion of housing estates, and increases the effects of eco-gentrification, making the most vulnerable communities more exposed to adverse effects of urbanization and climate change (Wolch et al., 2014; Anguelovski et al., 2018; Koprowska et al., 2020; Pearsall & Eller, 2020; Rigolon & Nemeth, 2020) . In both cases, IGS can serve as important planning alternatives, especially in cities where they are as abundant and widespread as in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Sikorska et al., in press) . Their integration into spatial planning systems as new temporary or permanent green spaces can be a viable solution, potentially welcome by residents, whoas shown by our researchare aware of the impact such places have on their quality of life. Since cultural ecosystem services are co-created by people and ecosystems (Andersson et al., 2015) , this is likely to set IGS in the city fabric by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f activities that promote their widespread use. A similar pattern of results was obtained by Mathey et al. (2018) : their research into urban brownfields with spontaneous vegetation shows that in the case of redevelopment, spontaneous vegetation should be linked with aesthetic motives as well as traditional concepts of land management in order to meet the residents' preferences for land use. This can lead to higher acceptance by local residents and help spatial planners to combine nature conservation and use of greenery (Sukopp, 2005; Mathey et al., 2018) . Moreover, the changes requested by respondents in our research referred to relatively minor interventions that would not always completely change the nature of the site nor impose a burden on municipal services. Such balanced intervention can meet the requirements of both people and nature. Additionally, the suggestion to plant trees in places with scarce tall vegetation would improve biodiversity and regulatory services. Indeed, studies of the influence of revitalization of brownfields conducted by Koch et al. (2018) show that redevelopment does not always lead to a reduction of i.e. cooling effects.",

In the conditions of generally poor health status of citizens, exacerbated by effects of climate change, shrinking and aging population, and struggle with poverty and social exclusion, IGS seem to be the easiest, and the most economical way to create multiple benefits to society and nature-based insurance system. Lack of formal recognition of IGS creates a very fragile balance between green and grey infrastructure, questioning sustainability and adaptability of cities. During preparation of this paper two out of five studied areas have been already lost for housing development. It coincided with coronavirus outbreak followed by enclosure of all formal green areas (still located at half kilometers distance, and separated with barriersbusy streets and railways from study places). The situation became an eye opening event to residents of many city districts, whose daily activities got squeezed to tiny, overcrowded back and front yards. There is however no evidence of changes in the city spatial planning policy while many other European cities started to revise approach to IGS (Samuelsson et al. 2020) .",

Data on visitor perception was collected through structured interviews in the immediate vicinity of the selected IGS (see the Appendix B). Since respondents were interviewed on-site (convenience sampling), their replies depended on their familiarity with the area and the direct visual perception of the IGS. The structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with randomly selected passers-by during two two-hour visits (morning and afternoon) between August and September 2017. The interviews were conducted under similar weather conditions (sunny, above 25 o C). In total, 20 conversations were conducted at each location. The first part of the questionnaire asked the respondents about their use of IGS (closed-ended questions). The second part explored the respondents' recognition of ecosystem services at the sites, with questions such as \"What does the site provide for you?\". Respondents could choose from a list of 11 services: five cultural ecosystem services, i.e., looking after their mental health (relaxation), maintaining physical health (recreation), J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f educational use, aesthetic function and inspiration; four regulating services, i.e., air purification, temperature regulation, rainwater retention and noise reduction; provisioning service, i.e., foraging for flowers, fruit and nuts; and supporting services, i.e., habitats for plant and animal species. Finally, the third part asked open-ended questions whether the respondents would like to change anything at the site, and what would it be. The questionnaire also contained a section on socio-demographic data (gender, age, education) (see the Appendix B).",
