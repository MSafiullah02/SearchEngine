SP-D is recognized to bind the S protein of SARS-CoV and enhance phagocytosis. Moreover, systemic SP-D is widely used as a biomarker of alveolar integrity. We investigated the relation between plasma SP-D, SARS-type pneumonia and the SARS-specific IgG response. Sixteen patients with SARS, 19 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (Streptococcus pneumonia) and 16 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. Plasma SP-D and anti-SARS-CoV N protein IgG were measured using ELISA. SP-D was significantly elevated in SARS-type pneumonia [median (95% CI), 453 (379-963) ng \u2044 ml versus controls 218 (160-362) ng \u2044 ml, P < 0.05] like in patients with CAP. SP-D significantly correlated with anti-SARS-CoV N protein IgG (r 2 = 0.5995, P = 0.02). The possible re-emergence of SARS or SARS-like infections suggests a need for minimal traumatic techniques for following the alveolar compartment, e.g. during testing of antivirals.

Secondly, the disease stage of patients in the study was not classified. Thus, these data cannot be applied to subgroups of patients with mild, moderate or severe disease. Thirdly, we did not measure SP-D in bronchoalveolar samples and as such it is uncertain why serum SPD levels were increased. Although systemic SP-D was increased in SARS patients and correlated with SARS-specific antibodies, SP-D failed to correlate with other measures of SARS disease, including leucocytopenia, thrombocytosis or chest radiographic score. One possibility is that these variables are not causally related. However, potential associations may be weak and a larger study with a wider variation in scores among study participants are needed to investigate these relationships in further detail. Some measures of disease activity, e.g. leucocytopenia and thrombocytosis, may reflect aspects of disease development which are not directly associated with alveolar damage and are not expected to follow the development of systemic SP-D. In this regard, previous studies of CAP demonstrated that there is no correlation between measures of SP-D and CRP or leucocyte counts in patients with pneumonia [32] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1291, "end": 1295, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, SP-D is a well-known biomarker for alveolar damage.

coated plates were washed and incubated with 200 ll of 10% BSA buffer for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Then the plates were washed again and incubated with dilutions of samples [1:100 dilute by 5% BSA Trisbuffered saline, 0.05% (v \u2044 v) Tween 20] for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Then the plates were washed again and incubated with 1:200 diluted horseradish peroxidase-labelled antihuman IgG antibody for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After the final wash, the bound enzyme was estimated by addition of 3,3\u00a2,5,5\u00a2-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Zymed, CA, USA) substrate solution. The colour reaction was stopped after 15-min incubation in the dark by the addition of 50 ll of 1 M H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance was read at 450 nm using a multichannel spectrophotometer. Each sample was tested in duplicate. Negative samples were the normal controls. A sample was considered positive if its adjusted optical density (OD) value (OD of test ) OD of control) exceeds the mean +3 SD of the normal controls and its titer is >1:400. The cut-off value for a positive sample corresponded to the lowest measurement of 0.219.Plasma SP-D measurement. SP-D in plasma was quantified as previously described[32] using ELISA. Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with F(ab\u00a2) 2 anti-human SP-D IgG (K477) at 4\u00b0C. Washed and blocked plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with dilutions of plasma, calibrator and control samples. Primary antibodies were 0.5 lg \u2044 ml of biotinylated monoclonal antibody antihuman SP-D (Hyb 246-4). Detection was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (43-4323; Zymed, South San Francisco, CA, USA) o-phenylenediamine (Kem-En-Tec, Copenhagen, Denmark) in citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5, containing 0.014% H 2 O 2 .", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "Purity of expressed SARS-CoV N proteins.
