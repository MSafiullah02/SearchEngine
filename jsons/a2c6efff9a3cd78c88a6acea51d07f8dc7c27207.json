Although evidence of the prevalence of PDCoV in China is accumulating, little published information about Chinese PDCoV isolates is available. In this study, we investigated the presence of PDCoV in 49 faecal/intestinal samples from piglets with diarrhoea on different farms in Hebei province. Five samples (10.2%) were positive for PDCoV, but no coinfection of PDCoV with other enteropathogens was observed. A PDCoV strain named HB-BD was successfully isolated from the intestinal contents of a diarrhoeic piglet and serially propagated in swine testicular (ST) cells for >40 passages. The complete genome of the HB-BD strain was sequenced and analysed. Genomic analysis showed that the HB-BD strain had a closer relationship with Chinese strains than those from other countries and was grouped within the Chinese PDCoV cluster.

The full genome of PDCoV is approximately 25.4 kb in length (Woo et al., 2012) , encodes two polymerase proteins (ORF1a/b) gene, four major structural proteins for the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well as non-structural protein 6 (NS6) and non-structural protein 7 (NS7) (Lee & Lee, 2014; Li et al., 2014) . The functions of PDCoV individual proteins have not been elucidated. However, among the structural proteins of the other coronaviruses, the S protein is known to play pivotal roles in interacting with the cellular receptor to mediate viral entry and is an antigenic target for neutralizing antibodies (Park, Song, Ha, & Park, 2007; Sato et al., 2011) . The M protein is a transmembrane protein that is responsible for the transport of nutrients across the membrane. In addition, the M protein plays an important role in viral assembly, as well as the induction of virus neutralization antibodies (Fan, Zuo, Li, & Pei, 2012) . The coronavirus N protein binds viral RNA and highly conserved. It is involved in several of the biological activities of the virus (Chang et al., 2006; Molenkamp & Spaan, 1997) . The S, M and N protein genes have been targeted for the development of virological and serological diagnostic assays for PDCoV (Chen, Gauger, et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015; Marthaler et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015; Su et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014) .

The purification of PDCoV HB-BD was performed as previously described(Hu, Jung, et al., 2015;Hu, Li, et al., 2015). To confirm whether PDCoV alone was replicated in ST cells, the cultures were evaluated for PDCoV, PEDV, TGEV and PRoV, respectively. Results showed that only PDCoV was detected from the HB-BD inoculated cell cultures that were all negative for other enteric viruses. This demonstrated that the PDCoV HB-BD strain was successfully isolated from the ST cells.

The cDNA was amplified by PCR using Taq DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The PCR mixture (20 ll) contained 4 ll cDNA, 2 ll of 10 9 PCR Buffer, 3 ll of 2.5 mM dNTP, 1 ll forward primer and reverse primer, respectively, 0.5 ll of Taq polymerase (5 U/ll) and 8.5 ll of H 2 O. Fragments of the HB-BD strain were amplified under the following conditions: denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C 9 30 s, 55\u00b0C 9 30 s and 72\u00b0C 9 2 min, and a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR product was cloned into the pMD19-T cloning vector (TaKaRa). The positive recombinant plasmids were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and were submitted to a commercial company (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) for sequencing. The raw genomic sequence fragments were imported to SeqMan in DNASTAR (DNAS-TAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) for assembly and annotation.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "BD strain showed 97.9%-99.1% nt identity and 97.2%-99.2% deduced amino acid (aa) identity.

Interestingly, no coinfection with PDCoV and PEDV was detected. In addition, all five PDCoV-positive samples were negative for all other enteropathogens detected in the present study. These findings are somewhat different from observations of infection with PDCoV in other provinces and other countries. If a greater number of samples were collected, some coinfection might have been detected. Although the prevalence of PDCoV in some provinces of China has been confirmed and the genetic characteristics of some Chinese PDCoV strains and those from other countries have been analysed, there is little published information about Chinese PDCoV isolates. In the present study, using ST cells, the PDCoV HB-BD strain was successfully isolated from the intestinal contents of a piglet with diarrhoea. After several passages, propagation of PDCoV HB-BD was confirmed by the detection of a typical CPE and infectious virus titration. The M, N and S gene sequences of HB-BD were also determined. To confirm whether the replication of any other swine enteric viruses occurred on ST cells, the cell culture-passaged samples were detected by RT-PCR and tested negative for PDCoV, PEDV, TGEV and PRoV. These results all indicate that the PDCoV HB-BD isolate was highly adapted to ST cells. The findings of Hu,Jung, et al. (2015) andDong et al. (2016)  indicate that the success rate of PDCoV isolation from samples of intestinal contents is relatively higher than that from faecal samples. However, even if the PDCoV virus is isolated from intestinal contents, the success rate is also influenced by other factors, such as virus viability, infectious virus titres and other substances in the intestinal contents", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
