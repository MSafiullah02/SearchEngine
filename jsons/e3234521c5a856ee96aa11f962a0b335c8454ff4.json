Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is the human cell receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. ACE2 expression increases on lung alveolar epithelial cells and adipose tissue due to obesity, smoking and air pollution. A significant relationship exists between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as more severe COVID-19 symptoms occur in smokers; comorbid J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 20 conditions due to obesity or excess ectopic fat accumulation as underlying risk factors for severe COVID-19 strongly encourage the virus/ACE2 receptor-ligand interaction concept.

To date it is unclear if this paradox is not broken by COVID-19. Whilst they can suffer less from severe COVID-19 infection, obese patients are nevertheless subject to the comorbidities associated with being overweight and they are subsequently more difficult to treat due to these factors (Jose and Manuel, 2020) . It is thought that obesity or excess ectopic fat deposition may be the underlying risk factors for severe COVID-19, because of their comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, insulin resistance, adipose tissue inflammation and detrimental effects on lung function. These risk factors are strongly associated with mortalities from COVID-19 and are more frequent among smokers. Indeed, obesity and smoking both definitely upregulate ACE2 receptor (Brake et al., 2020; Engeli et al., 2003) . Interestingly, obesity, air pollution and smoking-associated risk factors share underlying pathophysiology related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 is single strand RNA virus which uses type 1 transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein projections as a lock-and-key combination to breach cells. The viral glycosylated cell surface protein can be further classified as using two (S1 and S2) functional domains which manage the entry process ( Figure 1 ). Initial ACE2 receptor cell entry is operated by domain S1 (Li et al., 2005) , whilst S2 sets up cell and virus membrane fusion which is necessary for full infiltration into the cell (Coutard et al., 2020) .",

Proteolytic cleavage processes, as well as endocytosis are all activated by viral binding and these unit to attenuate ACE2 activity. Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 not only effectively exploits a critical and irreplaceable system that is ACE2 to enter and multiply in the host (Gheblawi et al., 2020) , but its ACE2 binding allows it to evade immune surveillance. The engulfment of ACE2 provides the virus access to the host cellular infrastructure, hence viral proliferation and immune evasion are inextricably linked with regard to successful and potentially devastating infection (Brake et al., 2020) . In normal circumstances, the RAS system is antagonized by ACE2, which is protective in terms of the development of systemic damage due to hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells. Indeed, a bad prognosis has been shown to be linked to ACE2 receptor activity, as well as the presence of secondary ARDS and other factors such as age, and sex and multiple comorbidities . Collectively, it is thought that dysfunction of the RAS is a common pathology seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected obese patients and smokers, however it has not been evaluated in detail.",

Their ICU admissions and subsequent IMV requirements are also considerably higher. Indeed, a fatal outcome is more likely with smokers Zhou et al., 2020) . Compounded by the smoking, the presence of obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular pathology and diabetes is greater among severe cases . In one study, (1099 COVID-19 patients), of the 19% of patients severely affected, just J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f under 17% were current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers. In another report, patients who had severe disease, where they were admitted to ICU, ventilated and/or who had fatal outcomes, about a quarter (25.5%) smoked and 7.6% were former smokers . Conversely, Liu et al. reported that among an adverse outcome group of patients, a smoking history was nine-fold more prevalent, than the group that showed improvement or stabilization. In these patients, age, history of smoking, respiratory failure, low albumin and high C-reactive protein were identified as the risk factors that lead to the acceleration of disease progress to pneumonia (Khot and Nadkar, 2020; . In only two studies from total of five, 288 of 1399 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with severe disease. In these patients COVID-19 progression was driven by smoking history, while the others were not thus associated Huang et al., 2020; Lippi and Henry, 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . The rate of ARDs development in COVID-19-infected individuals that already had pneumonia was around fifty-percent (Y. . Patients who are likely to die from the infection suffer pulmonary oedema and bilateral diffuse alveolar damage which is caused by significant inflammatory infiltrates (Solaimanzadeh, 2020) . Unfortunately, in these patients, obesity has serious consequences. In fact, ARDS from a number of causes, is often a major reason for significantly overweight (class III obese) patients being admitted to ICUs, where they are ventilated, which also occurs with COVID-19 patients (Marshall et al., 2016) . Multiple organ failure is usually cause of mortality in both morbidly obese and COVID-19 patient groups (Bellani et al., 2016) .",

Meanwhile, nicotine exhibits a dual effect by increasing ACE expression and causing a fall in ACE2 activity (Alifano et al., 2020; Meulenbelt et al., 1992) . Nicotine upregulates activity and expression of renin, ACE and Ang II type I receptor (AT1R). Interestingly, nicotine can also switch off compensatory expression and activity of ACE2 and Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) (Figure 1 ). Tobacco combustion products as well as nicotine administration itself promotes angiotensin I (Ang I) conversion to Ang II via promoting plasma ACE J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f activity (Oakes et al., 2018) . Tobacco smoke exposure also promotes lung inflammation, thus increasing mucosal inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (TNF-\uf061) expression, as well as increasing permeability in epithelial cells, mucus production, and impaired mucociliary clearance (Strzelak et al., 2018) . Similarly, the binding of the virus to the TLR promotes prointerleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 levels, which is in turn cleaved by caspase-1. As soon as this occurs, inflammasome activation is followed by the formation of mature IL-1\u03b2; this is itself an important promotor of inflammatory processes in the lung, as well as fever and fibrosis (Conti et al., 2020) . For the reasons described above, smoking increases the severity of COVID-19 associated inflammatory response.",

The proportions of IFN-\u03b3 yielding CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells rise in the seriously COVID-19 patients compared with mild cases. It is likely that the so-called inflammatory 'cytokine storm' in seriously ill patients is promoted by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells . It is claimed that lower counts of T lymphocyte subsets, (CD3+, CD4+,CD8+) and B-cells are associated with higher risks of in-hospital death of COVID-19 . Hence, the survival of the most seriously ill individuals is strongly predicated on the attenuation of the cytokine storm. The damage caused by the storm is orchestrated by IL-6, which presents a pharmacological target, for which there is already a candidate, tocilizumab (TCZ). This agent inhibits the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and can curtail IL-6 signal transduction (B. Luo et al., 2020; . In fact, TCZ was approved in 2017 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of life-threatening cytokine-release syndrome, which is commonly associated with respiratory symptoms ranging from cough and tachypnea to ARDS (Alzghari and Acu\u00f1a, 2020).",

Tobacco smoking is a powerful driver of all Smokers also exhibit increased ACE2 gene expression in type-2 pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, particularly at the apical end of the small airway epithelium, which is not seen in those who do not use tobacco. COPD itself promotes ACE2 expression thus providing ample targets for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (Brake et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2020) . So significant lung damage with tobacco use promotes the risk of COVID-19 and progression to severe disease (Brake et al., 2020; . Immune evasion of virus as mentioned above, may increase viral adhesion to the target host cells for relatively longer periods. This elevates the carrier status of the host due to their high local tissue viral load, which will promote the spread of the infection (Brake et al., 2020) . Ang II and AT1R, are key constituents of the RAS, and they regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Janus kinase (JAK) pathways (Kemp et al., 2014) . Lung injury is thought to be promoted by compromised RAS activity as this is linked J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f with local pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Indeed, ACEI, as well as Ang II receptor antagonists are capable of ameliorating lung damage in experimental models and this suggests that RAS activity is implicated. Thus, it could be proposed that those drugs may treat diffuse parenchymal lung disease successfully (Marshall, 2003) . Cigarette smoke exposure increases pulmonary ACE and ACE2 activity, however loss of ACE2 increases AngII by inducing the ACE activity (Hung et al., 2016) . As mentioned earlier, factors that promote ACE2 increase risk of severe COVID-19 . Any reduction in ACE2 activity restricts available virus-cell binding sites and may be protective in smokers.",

Obesity and insulin resistance are strongly linked with RAS activity. Furthermore, oxidative stress and inflammatory response along with mitochondrial dysfunction modulate the function of RAS . In addition, diabetic kidney damage is promoted by the renal RAS activation through endoplasmic reticulum stress, which is in turn induced by SFAs (Li et al., 2016) . Moreover, increased RAS activity in obesity initiates a series of interrelated pathological events. These include reduction of insulin secretion and sensitivity, as well as fostering a rise in arterial pressure. In all these conditions AT1R is upregulated. Contrarily, AT1R blockade improves hyperglycemia, hypertension and peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity (Rodriguez et al., 2018) .

            "text": "At the cellular level, renin forms angiotensin I (Ang I) from angiotensinogen. ACE cleaves Ang I forming Ang II (Lavoie and Sigmund, 2003) . Ang II acts at cell surface type I G protein-coupled receptors, AT1Rs then promote a pathological cascade including insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f vasoconstriction (Luther and Brown, 2011) . Reduction of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase activity due to elevated free fatty acids (FFA) levels is potentiated by Ang II and consequently insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is increased by RAS inhibition. Blockade of the AT1R has been shown to stimulate the differentiation of adipocytes that store FFAs, of which leads to reduced plasma FFA levels and decreased insulin resistance (Leiter and Lewanczuk, 2005) . RAS activity can also be upregulated by insulin resistance. This can in turn promote a series of linked pathophysiological issues such as inflammatory diseases, as well as the metabolic disorders associated with obesity (Muniyappa and Yavuz, 2013) . In fact, the major effects of Ang II are mediated by AT1R and AT2R. Overexpression of angiotensinogen increases adiposity, which is seen through hypertrophy of adipocytes, inflammation and increased resistance to insulin. RAS inhibition can ameliorate and even reverse these obesity related alterations in adipose tissue (Pahlavani et al., 2017 (Pahlavani et al., , 2017 . The fall in glucose-mediated insulin secretion is linked with lower pancreatic insulin content and upregulated AT1R protein expression in obesity. Essentially, \u03b2-cell dysfunction is strongly associated with AT1R upregulation, which accelerates glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, through a decrease in plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). In contrast, RAS blockade induces improvement in \u03b2-cell function and insulin sensitivity (Rodriguez et al., 2012; van der Zijl et al., 2012) . The general progression of atherosclerotic disease is also influenced by RAS, as well as its primary mediator Ang II. The mechanisms of this process include inflammation, disruption of fibrinolytic balance and endothelial dysfunction. The inhibitors of RAS such as ACEI and angiotensin receptor blockers act either by depleting the generation of Ang II or by blocking the binding of Ang II to its receptors (Husain et al., 2015) . ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels. The expression of ACE2 is substantially increased in patients with type 2 diabetes, who are treated with ACEI and ARBs (Y. . Similarly, treatment of hypertension with ACEI and ARBs, results in an upregulation of ACE2 (Li et al., 2017) . Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate COVID-19 due to spreading of SARS-CoV-2 . Since the ACE2 protein is the receptor that facilitates corona virus entry into cells, the notion that treatment with RAS blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal ARDS in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19 infection has been popularized. Interestingly, the contention that the presence of ACEI or AT1R blockers promote coronavirus infection through upregulating ACE2 expression in either animals or humans is not currently supported (Danser et al., 2020) . On the contrary, ACEI in addition to RAS inhibitors in COVID-19 patients with hypertension actually can improve clinical outcome . The use of selective AT1R antagonists in the treatment of hypertension is a useful concept.",

Obesity, air pollution and smoking are associated risk factors which share underlying pathophysiology related to the RAS in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Air pollution via the interference of NO2 increases the ACE activity. Meanwhile, nicotine exhibits dual effect on RAS. Obese adipose tissue synthesizes excess Ang II, thus the combination of an AT1R antagonist with an ACEI for more complete blockade of the RAS may be a rationally viable therapeutic strategy in obese COVID-19 patients. In this context, using ACEI or ARBs potentially contribute to the improvement of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients.

Coronaviruses use the surface spike (S) glycoprotein on the coronavirus envelope to attach host cells and mediate host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection. The spike protein includes two regions, S1 and S2. The receptor binding domain is located in the S1 region. SARS-CoV attaches the human host cells through the binding of the receptor binding domain protein to ACE2. The expression of ACE2 and the balance of Ang II/Ang 1-7 influence the course of the disease. ACEI and ARBs cause the increase in the formation of Ang 1-7 from Ang II via increased ACE2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.",
