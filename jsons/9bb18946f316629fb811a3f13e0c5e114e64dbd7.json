This virus belongs to Betacoronavirus which also contains SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV). [1, 2] The treatment of the patients with COVID-19 is the major challenge as mortality ranges from 3% to 4% as compared to seasonal influenza (0.1%). [3] More than 4,65,000 cases have now been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), and more than 21,000 people have lost their lives as of March 27, 2020. The disease started in December 2019 in China and spread to 200 countries as of now. The number is increasing day by day. It has been declared a pandemic by the WHO.

[9] Chloroquine An old drug with established safety and efficacy in malaria is being talked about so much so that it is going out of stock due to panic buying. Chloroquine, an antimalarial, antiamoebic, immunomodulatory, and a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug, is being reported to be effective in COVID-19. Chloroquine was discovered by Hans Andersag in 1934. [10] Chloroquine phosphate is being recommended in malaria in chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum malaria and is the first choice of drug in Plasmodium vivax malaria as per a national program in India. The recommended dose for treatment in malaria is 600 mg base (1000 mg salt) orally immediately, followed by 300 mg base (500 mg salt) orally at 6, 24, and 48 h. The total dose is 1500 mg base (2500 mg salt) over 3 days. The loading dose on day 1 is needed due to the large volume of distribution. The prophylactic dose is 500 mg weekly to be started 1 week before entering a malarious area and to continue 4 weeks after returning. [2, 11] ",

The main target cells for the SARS-CoV-2 are enterocytes and pneumocytes after it enters the body. After entry, the release of viral genome into the cytoplasm needs fusion of viral and cell membranes, and it attaches to these cells with the help of spike protein-host cell protein interaction. Chloroquine blocks virus infection by elevating endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of the virus. It is reported to act at virus entry and at postentry stages of the infection in vitro cells. Its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action can add to its efficacy in COVID-19. [5, 6, 12] ",
