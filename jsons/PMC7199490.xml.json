The serum samples were serially diluted 2-fold, from 1:100 to 1: 3200 (or from 1:100 to 1:12,800 if the NAb ID50 was >3200), and were mixed with 0.5 ng (p24) of pseudotype virus. After incubation for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, the mixture was added to the target cells. Virus infectivity was determined 48 h later by measuring the amount of luciferase activity expressed in infected cells. Neutralization was calculated as an inhibition percentage of virus infection (luciferase activity) at each dilution, compared with the serum-negative controls, as follows: neutralization percentage=[1-(luciferase activity with serum/luciferase activity without serum)]\u00d7100 [16, 17]. The titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the final dilution of serum at the pseudovirus ID50, which was calculated by use of GraphPad Prism4 software (GraphPad Software).",

This result suggests that NAbs may play a role in the clearance of SARS-CoV during the early stages of the disease. A similar correlation has been observed in infections caused by other respiratory viruses. For example, Chargelegue et al. found that the NAbs to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were responsible for the reduction of the viral load in vivo [24]. Moreover, as reported in previous studies, the NAbs to RSV could be successfully used for treating high-risk infants with RSV infection [25], suggesting that the NAbs to SARS-CoV may have therapeutic potency at an early stage of the disease. Another important characteristic of the NAbs to SARS-CoV is that they are maintained at a high level for at least 5 months (figure 3B), which may provide a protective mechanism and an explanation for the remarkably low rate of SARS-CoV reinfection [26]. On the other hand, we found that there was no clear correlation between the NAb titer and the course of disease (data not shown), suggesting that the NAbs to SARS-CoV did not confer protection against the development of symptoms. This apparent contradiction can be explained, however, by a recent suggestion made by Peiris et al. [20] that the lung damage that occurs during the later stages of SARS may be caused by an overexuberant host immunological response, rather than uncontrolled replication of SARS-CoV [13].",

For the 40 neutralization-positive, ELISA-negative serum samples, to rule out false-positive results in our neutralization assay, we further analyzed 17 of the samples by use of the binding assay using the S-HeLa cells.
