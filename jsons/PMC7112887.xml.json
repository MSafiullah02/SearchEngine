            "text": "Catalytic antibodies (catAbs) were first obtained in 1986 [1], [2] against transition state analogs. Amidase and peptidase activities were found in IgGs from the sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [3], factor VIII-cleaving allo-Abs in the sera of patients with severe hemophilia [4], and DNA-hydrolyzing, amidolytic and peptidolytic activities in Bence\u2013Jones proteins from patients with multiple myeloma [5]. The multiple myeloma patients of an Ab light chain that cleaves the human immunodeficiency virus protein gp120 demonstrated that natural Abs are not restricted to autoantigenic substrates [6]. Anti-DNA antibodies play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans [7]. It has been reported that some of the catAbs to DNA found in SLE patients have nuclease activity and catalyze hydrolysis of the DNA phosphodiester bond [7]. A natural catAbs was prepared by the immunization of mice with ground-state polypeptides or proteins such as Ab light chain-specific vasoactive intestinal peptide which has peptidase hydrolytic activity [8]. Also immunizing mice by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 gp41 polypeptide-stimulated Ab light chain enzymatically cleaved the conserved region of the HIV-1 envelope protein as well as the antigenic gp41 peptide [9]. Sequence analysis of anti-DNA mAbs from both patients with SLE and murine models of the disease showed that these high-affinity anti-dsDNA IgG contain a high proportion of somatic mutations in their VH and VL sequences [10], [11]. In many of these high-affinity anti-dsDNA IgG Abs, such somatic mutations lead to higher frequencies of certain amino acids, particularly arginine, asparagine, lysine, and tyrosine in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). It has been suggested that the structures of these amino acids allow them to form electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds with the negatively charged DNA phosphodiester backbone [11]. The aim of this work was to study mAbs and their DNA-hydrolyzing activities. The reactivity of the mAbs, to hydrolyse DNA, was intriguing enough to prompt us to further study their fine specificity and their catalytic mechanisms by analyzing the molecular sequence and structure of the VH and VL genes. Molecular modeling for stimulation with DNA catAb (m3D8) for predicting the catalytic mechanism of the variable region of mAb-4 (4 FV) and knowledge of the specific immunoglobulin genes used to target a common epitope may potentially be useful to identify protein DNA mimicry in the investigation of the origin of anti-DNA Abs catalytic activities.",

            "text": "The VH and V\u03ba regions of 14 CMV-specific mAbs generated from five different fusions of BALB/c mice were sequenced. These sequences were almost homologous with corresponding germline genes published in the GenBank database, outlined in Table 1\n, which summarizes the VH, D, and JH fragments of VH genes, and V\u03ba and J\u03ba of VL genes. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the expressed light chain germline gene were confidently assigned to a very restricted germline family V\u03ba2, gene bd2 (10 mAbs), GenBank accession nos. (EF672211, EF672212, EF672213, EF672214, EF672215, EF672216, EF672217, EF672218, EF672219, and EF672220; Table 1). Four Abs belonged to germline family V\u03ba1A, gene bb1.1. GenBank accession nos. (EF672221, EF672222, EF672223, and EF672224; Table 1). The identity of the V genes used was determined by searching the GenBank database for homologies to known V genes using the BLAST protocol [20]. Alternatively, the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the expressed VH genes of the 14 anti-CMV Abs are shown in Fig. 1\nand Table 1. The VH genes belong to the following GenBank accession nos.: VH1/VHJ558 (8 Abs) (EF672206, EF672197, EF672202, EF672203, EF672207, EF672208, EF672209, EF672210); VH5/VH7183 (3 Abs) (EF672198, EF672205, EF672201); VH8/VH3609 (3 Abs) (EF672199, EF672200, EF672204) (Table 1). In addition, the VH genes of the IgG Abs were more somatically mutated. D segment usage also appears to be restricted with 7 mAbs of VH using the DSP2 segment, while 3 mAbs were used for another segment, DFL16 (Fig. 1 and Table 2\n). On the other hand, it does not appear to be an obvious restriction in JH segment usage. Interestingly, most Abs could group into three sets based on their use of the same or highly similar VH and VL genes [21]. Gene rearrangement entails the joining of VH, D and JH germline genes followed by the joining of VL and JL genes. The heavy chains belong to three different families classified into three subgroups. The first includes four mAbs (4, 9, 11, and 521) and belongs to the VHJ558 germline family with different genes; the homology of the amino acid sequences are VH104B (99%), VHJ558.45 (94%), VHJ558.51 (89%) and VHJ558.51 (93%) [22], [23] (Fig. 1E, F, G, respectively). However, the VH genes belong to germline family VHJ558, gene V130.3, with 97, 97, 95, and 94% identity, respectively (Fig. 1B) [24]. D segments belong to DSP2.11 combined with JH2 (Table 1). The second subgroup includes three mAbs-(5, 8, and 52) (Fig. 1C and D) whose VH gene segments are from the VH7183 germline family [25]. The mAbs-(5 and 52) VH genes are derived from the same germline gene VH7183.14 with 97 and 95% amino acid homology, respectively (Fig. 1D) [26]. The third subgroup includes mAbs-(6, 7, and 122) VH genes which are derived from the same VH3609 germline family, CB17H.10 gene [25] with 96, 96, and 95% homology, respectively (Fig. 1A) (Table 1).",

The combined processes of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and somatic hypermutation allowed for the creation of an extremely diverse Ab repertoire. VH-521 showed 16 mutations, five of which were silent, while 11 others led to the mutation of amino acid no. 6 glutamine in germline to glutamic acid (Gln6HGlu); Ala9HPro; Ser31HLys; Thr54HSer; Glu58HAsp; Asp65HGly; Ala71HVal; Gln80HGlu; Ser82HHis; Ala94HThr; and Arg95HAsn (Fig. 1F). VH-(4 and 9) showed 18 mutants, 7 silent and 11 amino acid replacements: Thr19HLys; Lys23HArg; Ser25HLue; Gly26HIle; Met34HVal; Asp52HLue; Glu53HGly; The54HAsn; and Gly56HAsn; Arg82AHSer; and Lue94HAsn. The only difference between two VH-(4 and 9) Abs is a one-point mutation in the VH gene in CDRH2 Lys65HIle and another in the DSP2 segment of Phe99HTyr (Fig. 1G). In contrast, VH-11 revealed only two substitutions, the first in CDRH2 with Cys54HSer and the second in FW3 with Arg94HIle (Fig. 1E). VH-5 revealed 7 mutants: 2 were silent and 5 were substitutions: Ser55HGly; Tyr56HSer; Arg75HLys; Arg83HLys; Lue89HMet (Fig. 1D). VH-52 revealed 10 mutations: 3 were silent and 7 were substitutions, 5 being typical as Fd-5 with two more substitutions; Thr50HTyr and Ser62HThr (Fig. 1D). VH-6 has 10 mutants, 3 silent and 7 substitutions: Asn33HGly; Ile35AHVal; Asp56HSer; Ser62HAla; Ser74HTyr; Thr82AHAla; and Thr82BHSer. VH-72 showed 11 mutants, 3 silent and 8 substitutions, similar to Fd-6 substitutions, except for Trp52HLue and Thr82BHAsn (Fig. 1A). VH-122 showed 13 mutants, 3 silent and 10 substitutions, similar to Fd-72, except for Asn33HAsp and Ser41HPro; Ala49HLue (Fig. 1A). As the frequency of the PCR error used in this study was one in 5000\u201310,000 nucleotides, the intraclonal sequence heterogeneity observed here is most likely not derived from PCR errors.",

However, MAbs-(5 and 53) used the VH7183.14 germline gene which showed high homology sequence with IgM polyreactive natural autoAbs [34] (Fig. 2) while mAb-8 shows high similarity with the heavy chain of influenza hemagglutinin Ha1 [35] (Fig. 2). Three mAbs (6, 7, and 122) showed high homology with anti-sweetener heavy chain [36] and similarity with mimicry of cocaine by anti-idiotypic Abs.",

All 10 Abs use a VL region encoded by V\u03ba 2-J\u03ba1 or -J\u03ba2 recombination; in addition, the Tyr residue was more frequently observed in 8 mAbs at the V\u03ba\u2013J\u03ba joint (VL96). This residue is encoded by J\u03ba2, while the Gln residue was observed twice at position VL96 while the Trp residue was observed once at the same position, VL96. Interestingly, the VL34 residue is an Asn germline code V\u03baII bd2 germline gene which is typical to Abs VL-specific CMV-CP while the VL-(4, 6, and 7), VL34 Asn residue was substituted with Ser (Asn34Ser) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the VL gene was very restricted against CMV-CP, with high homology to numerous and different Abs raised against autoimmune diseases (anti-DNA, -RNA, -Sm, and -histone) as well as some human viruses (HIV-Gp41 and p24; Hepatitis B and C virus), and catAb proteolytic light chain, esterase-like catAb, and Ab catalysis of the cationic cyclization reaction (Fig. 3A). Four Abs used another V\u03baIA-J\u03ba4 (Fig. 3B) which revealed high homology with the light chain against different specific antigens whose identity varied from 94 to 98% with light chains from the database i.e., influenza hemagglutinin neutralizing Ab, anti-ssDNA, -RNA, -fluorescein, -polysaccharide, and -bisphenol-A (Fig. 3B) suggesting an intrinsic polyspecificity associated with the VL. In fact, V\u03ba1 is common to a relatively large population of Abs that bind a large number of antigens, including proteins, DNA, steroids, peptides, and small haptens [37]. Thus, the polyspecificity intrinsic to V\u03ba1 may contribute to the ability of the germline repertoire to bind to a wide array of chemical structures.",

Particularly, the Abs derived from germline gene V\u03baII bd2 showed higher relative activity than that derived from germline gene V\u03baIA bb1 (Fig. 4\n). Furthermore, the relative DNAse catalytic activity might depend on the VH germline. In this case, in the presence of Mg2+, most mAbs showed high DNA catalytic activity within a varying pH range (Fig. 4). Alternatively, the mAbs showed only a single break in linear DNA at pH 7\u201310 in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 4B, D, F, H, and L). In contrast, polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) illustrated a very restricted pH range, 7\u20137.5 (Fig. 4I and G). mAbs 5 and 6 revealed the disappearance of DNA in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 4C and E) while mAbs 4 and M2-4 showed less activity than mAb-5 and -6 (Fig. 4A and G). Notably, incubation of mAbs with CMV, polyglutamic acid, and dextrin sulphate efficiently inhibited DNase catalytic activity [15]. Remarkably, mAbs having different VH combining ability with one VL showed different DNase catalytic activity; therefore, we speculate that VH could increase or decrease catalytic activity depending on the germline genes (Fig. 4 and Table 1).",

The VL and VH sequences of the IgG4 Ab share a very high level of identity with known Abs for which a crystal structure has been reported [38]. Superposition of homology modeled 4-FV structure with the crystal structure of m3D8 scFv (PDB 2GKI) [38]. The alpha carbon traces of VH and VL domains of m3D8 and 4 are displayed in the indicated color code. Two critical residues for the catalysis (HisH35 and HisL93) with a similar orientation of key residues, potentially implied in the catalysis, were observed (Fig. 5\n) and putative DNA binding residues (Tyr residues at L32, L49, and H97) are highlighted as a stick model. The images were generated using PyMol software (DeLano Scientific LLC). The 3D structure similarity, added to the ability of 4-FV to hydrolyze DNA, suggest that the active sites of both catalysts probably have structural similarities. Superposition of the active sites of 4-FV to predict the binding site with the active sites of anti-DNA (m3D8) Ab indicates that Tyr [L32, L49 (green) and H97 (brown)] residues of 4-FV are equidistant to Tyr [L32, L49, L92 (turquoise), H97, and H100a (pink)] residues of the DNA catalytic m3D8 Ab (Fig. 6\n). Furthermore, superposition of the active sites of 4-FV with the active sites of anti-ssDNA (DNA-1) Abs indicates that Tyr [L32, L49, and L92 (turquoise)], Tyr [H97, H100 and H100a (pink)] residues binding with dT3 (brown) are at similar distances to Tyr [L32, L49 (green), and H97 (brown)] (Fig. 7\n). The structure shows that Ab binds oligo(dT) primarily by sandwiching thymine bases between Tyr side-chains, which allows the bases to make sequence-specific hydrogen bonds (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). The 3D model is assessed by simulation of molecular dynamics to determine its stability and by comparison with those of known protein structures. The structural information from the theoretically modeled complex can help us to further understand the catalytic mechanism of anti-DNA Abs.",

            "text": "Using data from known Ab crystal structures and computer modeling, a series of linkers were designed and evaluated as potential candidates to genetically connect the VH and VL regions. The resulting scFv molecules were evaluated for their functional activities and relative affinity [39]. Very little molecular characterization of natural catalytic Abs with mAbs has been achieved so far. Due to the activation of the immune system as a response to a foreign antigen, maturation of the Ab response takes place, resulting in the production of specific, high-affinity Abs. Therefore, specific Abs can be selected using a relatively small, random combinatorial V gene library derived from an immunized donor [40]. The procedure included the isolation of the VH and VL of the murine mAb from mRNA of 14 hybridoma cells, followed by cloning, sequencing and characterization of the FV. VH gene usage was determined and compared to VH genes used by Ab fragments of a germline database. The VH and V\u03ba regions of 14 anti-CMV mAbs generated from five different fusions of BALB/c mice were immunized with native CMV-CP, and the VH, D, JH, V\u03ba, and J\u03ba were determined (Table 1). All the Abs were derived from distinct B cells because they had utilized diverse VH, D, and JH gene combinations, and because the length of the CDR3 region ranged from 7 to 17 amino acid residues (Table 2). An abundance of VH genes from the J558 family was observed (8/14) but each represented a separate member of the family (Table 1). The VL is encoded by the V\u03ba1 gene, which is common to a relatively large population of Abs that bind a large number of antigens including proteins, DNA, steroids, peptides, and small haptens [37]. Certain combinations of germline V genes (V\u03ba, J\u03ba and VH) are polyspecific in nature and can be used to construct Ab-combining sites for structurally very distinct ligands. Germline Ab polyspecificity further expands the binding potential of the germline repertoire [37]. This polyspecificity may be general to several germline-encoded Abs and may have been selected for by the immune system to provide a mechanism for rapid generation of Abs of moderate to high affinity for a broad range of antigens [37]. CMV-CP is capable of inducing a variety of B cells that have distinct phenotypic and genotypic paratopes. Interestingly, the high DNase catalytic Abs were encoded by germline genes such as mAb-8 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, analysis of DNase catalytic activities and nucleotide sequences of the VH and VL showed a strong correlation with the germline heavy chains, in which mAb-(8) was derived from VH7183, showing high DNase catalytic activity (Fig. 4K and L). Prominently, the result of the relative activity of the six different mAbs (4, 5, 6 and 8) showed diverse relative activities, although their light chain genes had high relative identity; therefore, the fact that VH domain can modulate catalytic activity is potentially important in these mAbs (Fig. 4). One of the important aspects of VL and VH amino acid sequences is the study of the structural analysis of the antigen-binding loops by molecular modeling and simulation of molecular dynamics. Through these findings, amino acid His (H35 and L93) residues may play a crucial role in the DNA\u2013Ab interaction (Fig. 5). Tyr (L32, L49 and H97) side-chains that exist in the antigen combining site might be capable of mediating most of the contacts necessary for DNA recognition, and thus it seems likely that the overabundance of Tyr in natural antigen-binding sites is a consequence of the side chain being particularly well suited for making productive contacts with antigen [41]. Interestingly, the genes encoding the heavy chain variable region of these Abs displayed evidence of only minimal somatic hypermutation (Fig. 1C). We consider that the negative charge on the acetate group in the CMV-CP was partially neutralized by a hydrogen bond with the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine, which exists in HCDR3. Therefore, we speculate and expect that the HCDR3-peptide be used as tool for plant virus resistance depending on the peptide-neutralizing epitope.",
