Because the latter years are more likely to reflect current practice, we restricted analysis in our primary mortality models to the last 5 years (2010\u20132014). Analysis done using the entire study period yielded similar results. We used the Elixhauser comorbidity index as a measure of the overall condition of patients in these models including baseline risk of mortality and used clinical factors such as coma, hemiplegia, hydrocephalus, craniotomy/craniectomy, hydrocephalus requiring external ventricular drain (EVD) placement, tracheostomy, APR-DRGs for severity of illness and mortality as surrogate measures for ICH severity.

The program starts with the minimum number of joinpoint (e.g., 0, which is a straight line) and tests whether more joinpoints are statistically significant and must be added to the model. The annual percentage change (APC) is then computed for each of the identified trends by fitting a regression line to the natural logarithm of the rates using calendar year as a regressor variable.",

Prior studies have shown that emergency medical services may systematically transfer the sickest ICH patients to stroke centers most of which are in urban communities [22], so it is not surprising that patients hospitalized in urban centers had more severe ICH. However, before now, excess mortality in rural areas has been thought to be secondary to higher stroke incidence (new cases of stroke) alone with no major contribution from case fatality (proportion of patients dying from stroke) [23]. Mortality = incidence X case-fatality rate [24].

Rural residents have traditionally been known to be more likely to have poorer control of ICH risk factors including hypertension, an important determinant of early post-ICH neurologic deterioration [25]. Late recognition of stroke symptoms [26], geographic dispersion of hospitals in rural areas with increased transit time to care hospitals and delays in triaging stroke patients may all result in delayed management in rural residents [27]. The resultant time delays could increase the risk of brain edema, hematoma expansion and other negative sequelae of ICH. Previously identified systemic factors such as lack of established stroke treatment protocols or suboptimal ancillary medical care, in addition to paucity of human resources including emergency response personnel, neurologist, neurosurgeons, radiologist and neuroimaging services in rural areas, may also contribute to the poorer ICH outcome [28].",

Whereas neurocritical care as a specialty has expanded over the last decade and there has been diffusion of neurocritical expertise to medical and surgical intensive care units across the country, most centers with neurocritical care expertise are in urban locations. Increased adherence to American Heart Association guidelines recommending stroke patients be treated in centers equipped for emergency stroke care [30] is most likely a major contributor to declining ICH hospitalization in rural hospitals as rural patients may have been increasingly diverted to designated stroke centers in urban areas for their care. With fewer patients treated at rural hospitals over time, physicians and other healthcare workers at these centers may have slowly become less experienced or less competent in managing ICH over time. Bolstering neurocritical care support to rural hospitals through telemedicine technology may provide an avenue to bridge some of the clinical gaps in care and improve ICH outcome in these centers.",

Despite the strengths of ICH case ascertainment by use of clinically diagnosed ICH as opposed to self-reported stroke and the generalizability of our results to the entire US population, there remain limitations. Although we relied on previously validated codes for ICH and for major covariates, we cannot exclude potential inaccuracies due to coding errors. Our results represent those across all hospitals in specific regions and the entire country and do not necessarily reflect the quality of care in individual hospitals or states. Our results likely underestimate true mortality gaps between patients residing in rural and urban areas because definition of rural location was based on hospital location and not residential area of patients. The sickest rural ICH patients may have been transferred to designated stroke centers usually in urban locations for care and therefore misclassified under this group. The converse is also possible: that is the sickest ICH patients who are too unstable for transfer, those who choose hospice care or have DNR orders may remain in rural hospitals and potentially increase in-hospital mortality estimates for rural hospitals. However, given the small percentage of rural hospitalizations that are transferred to other hospitals (5.9%), the magnitude of any effect from this on study estimates is likely minimal. DNR is often the initial process of the negotiations (clinical pathway) relating to withdrawal/withholding of life sustaining therapies [31]. Prior studies have shown after multivariable analysis, that urban hospital location is an independent predictor of palliative care utilization [32], but in the absence of temporal data on the implementation of these orders, we are unable to comprehensively evaluate the influence of DNR or palliative care orders on outcome.",

ICH patients hospitalized in Joint commission-certified stroke centers have lower odds of mortality compared to those in non-certified stroke centers [33]. Information on stroke center designation or Get with the Guidelines affiliation is not available in the NIS, so we are unable to compare outcomes between designated stroke centers in rural areas to those in urban areas. We are also unable to adjust for other important factors such as mode of transportation, neurosurgical coverage or intensive care unit status because this information is not available in our dataset. Our study evaluated mortality risk in hospitalized acute ICH patients alone. However, many patients die before ICH hospitalization and others continue to die after acute ICH hospitalization, so this study does not capture total ICH mortality for the entire population. Thirty-day and 90-day outcome measures are still needed to more accurately estimate short-term mortality. We were unable to differentiate between first-ever and recurrent ICH and could not provide information on radiological severity of ICH by virtue of inherent limitations in our database. Disparity in the recognition/treatment of hydrocephalus and utilization of craniotomy noted in this study may be indicative of some areas where care between rural and urban hospitals differs but in the absence of radiological information on ICH characteristics, no definite conclusions can be drawn from our findings. The APR-DRGs used as one of the indices of ICH severity have shown good predictive performance for stroke and critical care mortality but have not been validated specifically in ICH patients. Other surrogate measures of ICH severity used in this study such as ventilator status, tracheostomy and gastrostomy may also reflect differences in the care received between rural and urban patients. Although we adjusted for an extensive list of covariates in our multivariable models, we cannot exclude residual confounding due to uncontrolled factors. For example, because information on hematoma size or hematoma expansion was unavailable in the NIS, these variables could not be included in the models and thus may represent a potential source of residual confounding.",
