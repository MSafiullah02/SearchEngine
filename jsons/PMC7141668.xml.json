Available data shows that effectiveness of ARV therapy is also influenced by both viral subtype and pre-existing mutations [10, 11]. Furthermore, it has been postulated that the pathways to drug resistance may be affected by pre-existing polymorphisms among different HIV-1 subtypes [12].",

            "text": "Most reports on HIV-1 drug resistance so far has focused on subtype B viruses which is prevalent in the Western world. There is however comparatively little available data from less developed countries where non-B subtypes predominate. In Nigeria where the epidemic is largely driven by non-B subtypes, reports on HIV drug resistance and polymorphisms [12\u201321] have primarily focused on resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) while resistance to Protease inhibitors (PI) remain understudied. Since the commencement of ART program in Nigeria in 2001, government has collaborated with some donor agencies such as Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to scale up its ART clinics. With subsequent revision of the treatment guidelines by WHO first in 2010 [22], 2013 [23] and more recently in 2016 [24], initiation of ART for infected individuals is now recommended regardless of WHO clinical stage and at any CD4 cell count as against the previous \u2264200 cells/mm3 during the pre-2010 era. This greatly increased the number of patients commencing first-line ART with anticipated increase in development of drug resistance. In Nigeria the recommended first line ARV drugs between 2010 and 2013 were AZT+3TC +EFV OR AZT+3TC+NVP OR TDF +3TC (or FTC) + EFV OR TDF +3TC (or FTC) + NVP. Patients failing first-line ARV treatments require switching to second-line regimens. Drug-regimens consist mostly of NNRTIs and NRTIs in the first-line with the addition of protease inhibitors (PIs) in the second-line. Adequate knowledge of drug resistance mutations and polymorphisms in protease gene of the circulating strains is therefore needed to help optimize the selection of second-line regimens for patients who are failing first-line regimens and limit the acquisition of cross-resistance. The aim of this study was to characterize and determine the polymorphisms and drug resistance mutations to PIs of HIV-1 isolates from first-line ART-experienced individuals in South-eastern Nigeria.",

However, some other studies conducted in different parts of the country on both drug na\u00efve and experienced patients reported no major PI resistance mutations [18, 19]. Acquisition of PI resistance is known to be cumulative in nature requiring sequential accumulation of mutations in the setting of on-going exposure to non-suppressive PI-based ART [27, 28]), therefore the appreciable level of IAS PR mutation detected among the patients in our study is a serious cause for concern as it places them at increased risk of accumulating additional PI resistance mutations.",

This V82L mutation is shown to confer low-level resistance to ATV/r, FPV/r and SQV/r as well as potential low-level resistance to IDV/r and LPV/r while it confers intermediate-level resistance to NFV and TPV/r. All the patients had preserved susceptibility to DRV/r since it is the only PI drug analysed that was not selected by any resistance mutation. Similar observations had been reported in a more widespread study in Nigeria which examined the impact of maintaining patients on failing second line ART on the accumulation of PR mutations [30]. Isolates in this study also showed high level of susceptibility (96.4%) to SQV/r. The only isolate with intermediate-level resistance to these drugs had V82L major PI resistance mutation as well as L10I and N88D minor PI resistance mutations. V82L is an uncommon non-polymorphic substrate-cleft mutation known to reduce susceptibility to TPV. This mutation was reported at a frequency of 22.2% in a similar study by Odaibo et al. [17].",

Although the presence of these minor mutations do not lead to high level resistance when occurring alone, they have to be taken into account by physicians before making treatment decisions as they may play a role in improving viral fitness or increasing the drug resistance level in the presence of major PI mutations [31\u201334].",

Other mutations/polymorphisms that occurred at very high frequencies among patients in this study include; I13V/A, K20I, E35Q, M36I/L, R41K, R57K/G, L63T/P/S/Q, C67E/S, H69K/R, V82I and L89M. Similar mutations/polymorphic substitutions in the protease region had been reported earlier for some Nigerian isolates [13]. I13V/A, K20I, M36I/L, R41K, H69K/R and L89M are the consensus mutations identified for subtypes G, UG and CRF02_AG while E35Q, R57K/G, C67E/S and V82I are the consensus mutations for G and UG in this study. A study on PI-naive Nigerian HIV-patients have earlier identified I13V, M36I and H69K as wild-type consensus mutations for HIV-1 subtypes G\u2032, G, CRF02_AG, CRF06_cpx, and A. The same study also identified K20I as consensus for G\u2032, G, CRF02_AG, and CRF06_cpx while V82I was identified as the consensus for G\u2032 and G [14]. Although our study utilized samples from first-line drug experienced individuals, the findings are consistent with these earlier reports from drug na\u00efve individuals. In addition, the mutations K14R, N37D/S/E/H and L63T/P/S/Q occurred in \u2265 25% of subtype G, UG and CRF02_AG patients, at a proportion that is significantly greater than in subtype B. Similarly, mutations L10V/I, L19P, E35D, I64L/M and K70R occurred in \u2265 25% of CRF02_AG patients at a proportion that is significantly greater than in subtype B in this study. There is already a concern that treatment of non-subtype B infected persons with PI could be less effective as a result of higher frequency of polymorphism in the protease gene of non-B isolates including positions 20, 36, 63 and 82 [10]. The limitation of this study however is the small sample size (28 samples) analysed. A larger sample size would have showed a clearer picture of the situation.",

The high level of these drug resistance mutations will not augur well for PI treatment interventions. This result therefore underscores the need for periodic genotypic DR testing of patients on ART and prior to second-line ART switch for early detection of DR mutations and selection of appropriate treatment regimens. The only challenge however is the high cost of carrying out these tests which may limit its implementation in resource limited settings.",
