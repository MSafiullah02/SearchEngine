Three proteins (\u2423a, \u2424a, and \u2425a) are translated directly from the genomic RNAs and the remaining proteins encoded on RNA\u2424 and RNA\u2425 are expressed via three subgenomic messenger RNAs (sgRNAs). sgRNA\u24241 directs synthesis of the triple gene block 1 (TGB1) protein. The TGB2 protein, the TGB2\u0408 minor translational readthrough protein, and the TGB3 protein are expressed from sgRNA\u24242, which is present in considerably lower abundance than sgRNA\u24241. A third sgRNA, sgRNA\u2425, is required for expression of the \u2425b protein. We have used deletion analyses and site-specific mutations to define the boundaries of promoter regions that are critical for expression of the BSMV sgRNAs in infected protoplasts. The results reveal that the sgRNA\u24241 promoter encompasses positions \u03ea29 to \u03ea2 relative to its transcription start site and is adjacent to a cis-acting element required for RNA\u2424 replication that maps from \u03ea107 to \u03ea74 relative to the sgRNA\u24241 start site. The core sgRNA\u24242 promoter includes residues \u03ea32 to \u03ea17 relative to the sgRNA\u24242 transcriptional start site, although maximal activity requires an upstream hexanucleotide sequence residing from positions \u03ea64 to \u03ea59. The sgRNA\u2425 promoter maps from \u03ea21 to \u03e92 relative to its transcription start site and therefore partially overlaps the \u2425a gene. The sgRNA\u24241, \u24242, and \u2425 promoters also differ substantially in sequence, but have similarities to the putative homologous promoters of other Hordeiviruses. These differences are postulated to affect competition for the viral polymerase, coordination of the temporal expression and abundance of the TGB proteins, and constitutive expression of the \u2425b protein.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The synthesis of subgenomic messenger RNAs (sgRNAs) is a common strategy employed by positive-sense RNA viruses to mediate expression and regulation of 3\u0408 proximal open reading frames (ORFs) on multicistronic genomic RNAs. Three general mechanisms have been proposed for sgRNA synthesis (White, 2002) . The most commonly accepted mechanism, internal initiation from negative-sense RNA templates (Miller et al., 1985) , appears to be operating during sgRNA synthesis by the Bromoviruses (Seigel et al., 1997 (Seigel et al., , 1998 , Alfamoviruses (Van Der Kuyl et al., 1990) , Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) (Wang and Simon, 1997) , and several other viruses . In contrast, a discontinuous mechanism of transcription that produces sgRNAs with 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 sequences identical to the genomic RNAs has been reported for the large Coronaviruses (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998) and Arterioviruses (Pasternak et al., 2001) . These sgRNAs arise from minus-strand subgenomic templates produced via polymerase jumping during transcription from genomic RNA templates. A third mechanism, premature termination, has been reported for Flock house virus (FHV) (Zhong and Ruekert, 1993; Lindenbach et al., 2000) , Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) (Sit et al., 1998) , and Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) (reviewed by White, 2002) . In these cases, truncated negative-sense RNAs that had been generated by premature termination at regions of secondary structure of genomic RNA are postulated to serve as templates for the positive-sense sgRNAs. In the case of FHV and TBSV, cis-acting sequences within the genomic RNA are postu-lated to mediate long distance interactions that contribute to premature polymerase termination during transcription of the negative-sense templates (White, 2002) , whereas in the case of RCNMV, termination during transcription from the RNA 1 template requires base pairing of trans-activator sequences residing on RNA 2 with trans-activator binding sequences on RNA 1 (Sit et al., 1998) . Other less welldefined examples of premature termination appear to occur during synthesis of two classes of 5\u0408 coterminal sgRNAs appearing in Citrus tristiza virus (CTV) infected plants (Che et al., 2001) . Although the possible functions of the CTV sgRNAs have not been resolved, the synthesis of the two species appears to be regulated because they exhibit some differences in the timing of their appearance and they are the earliest and the most abundant sgRNAs synthesized.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 300, "text": "(White, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 395, "end": 416, "text": "(Miller et al., 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 486, "end": 506, "text": "(Seigel et al., 1997", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 507, "end": 529, "text": "(Seigel et al., , 1998", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 546, "end": 573, "text": "(Van Der Kuyl et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 603, "end": 625, "text": "(Wang and Simon, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 834, "end": 861, "text": "(Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 881, "end": 905, "text": "(Pasternak et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1160, "text": "(Zhong and Ruekert, 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1185, "text": "Lindenbach et al., 2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1247, "text": "(Sit et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1311, "text": "White, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1771, "text": "(White, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1996, "text": "(Sit et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2203, "text": "(Che et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The core sgRNA promoters have been mapped and characterized in a variety of plant RNA viruses that synthesize either single or multiple sgRNAs .

BSMV is a Hordeivirus whose genome is divided into three positive-sense, single-stranded RNAs, designated \u2423, \u2424, and \u2425 (Fig. 1) . The \u2423 and \u2425 RNAs are required for replication, while RNA\u2424 is essential for cell-to-cell movement. The replicase proteins \u2423a and \u2425a are translated directly from their respective genomic RNAs . In addition, RNA\u2425 also encodes a small cysteine-rich protein, designated \u2425b, that is translated from sgRNA\u2425 and is dispensable for BSMV replication. The coat protein, \u2424a, is translated directly from RNA\u2424 and, following an intergenic region, the overlapping viral movement genes are arranged in a \"triple gene block\" (TGB). The three major TGB proteins (TGB1, 2, and 3) and one minor protein, TGB2\u0408, are translated from two sgRNAs, designated sgRNA\u24241 and sgRNA\u24242.

The TGB2\u0408 protein is a translational readthrough product of the TGB2 ORF, and the TGB3 protein is translated by leaky scanning of the TGB2 start codon (Zhou and Jackson, 1996b) .

This site resides within the 42-nt intergenic region between the \u2425a and \u2425b ORFs (Fig. 1) . To analyze the sgRNA\u2425 promoter, BY-2 protoplasts were transfected with in vitro transcripts, and the RNAs synthesized during infection were evaluated by Northern blot analyses. Because the \u2425a stop codon is located 18 nt upstream of the sgRNA\u2425 transcriptional start site, we predicted that the sgRNA\u2425 promoter would overlap the \u2425a ORF. The \u2425a protein encodes the viral polymerase and hence is essential for viral replication. Therefore, engineering deletions to map the sgRNA\u2425 promoter could have interfered with the \u2425a ORF and might have affected replication. To circumvent this problem, protoplasts were transfected with two RNA\u2425 derivatives. One RNA, \u2425KpnI/HpaI, provided a source of the \u2425a replicase protein and also contained a 350-nt deletion (from positions 2112 to 2461 on RNA\u2425) to remove the majority of the \u2425b ORF, and a second derivative designed to assess promoter activity contained deletions engineered within the putative sgRNA\u2425 promoter ( Fig. 2A) . The deletion present in \u2425KpnI/HpaI RNA al-lowed us to distinguish between the two RNA\u2425 derivatives based on their sizes. Protoplasts were transfected with RNA\u2423, RNA\u2425, and RNA\u2425KpnI/HpaI, and nucleic acid was extracted from protoplasts at 20 h posttransfection. Each of the three RNAs replicated to wild-type (wt) levels in protoplasts and synthesized the predicted sgRNAs (data not shown). Therefore, in subsequent mapping experiments, Fig. 1 . Illustration of the BSMV genomic and subgenomic RNAs. RNA\u2423 serves as the mRNA for the \u2423a protein, which contains the capping and helicase subunits of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RNA\u2424 encodes the \u2424a protein (coat protein) and the \"triple gene block\" composed of the TGB1, TGB2, TGB2\u0408, and TGB3 proteins. The \u2424a protein is translated from the genomic RNA; the TGB1 protein is expressed from sgRNA\u24241 and the TGB2, TGB2\u0408, and TGB3 proteins are translated from sgRNA\u24242. The genomic RNA\u2425 serves as a messenger for translation of the \u2425a polymerase subunit of the RdRp and encodes the \u2425b protein, which is expressed from sgRNA\u2425. All genomic and subgenomic RNAs are capped (black circle) at the 5\u0408 terminus, contain an internal poly (A) tail (A n ), and possess a conserved tRNA-like structure (black rectangle) at the 3\u0408 terminus. The schematic illustration shows the two \u2425 RNAs used in conjunction with RNA\u2423 to transfect protoplasts. The \u2425 KpnI/HpaI RNA provided a source of the \u2425a protein, while the second RNA\u2425 was used to construct deletions within the region surrounding the sgRNA\u2425 transcription start site (note arrow). Tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were cotransfected with the \u2423 and \u2425 KpnI/HpaI RNAs plus RNA\u2425 derivatives with deletions originating at either \u03ea152 or \u03e957 relative to the sgRNA\u2425 transcription start site. The deletions are shown above the blot. Total nucleic acid was extracted 20 h posttransfection, separated on 1% agarose gels, and transferred to nylon membranes. Northern blot analyses were conducted with a \u2425-specific riboprobe designed to detect the presence of the genomic RNA\u2425 and sgRNA\u2425. The probe was derived from the KpnI/HindIII (2111 to 2444 nt) fragment of RNA\u2425 and hence does not hybridize to the genomic or sgRNAs generated from the \u2425 KpnI/HpaI RNA.

These results indicate that the deleted regions are not required for sgRNA\u2425 synthesis and that they do not contain regulatory elements that affect replication. Therefore, a more refined analysis of the sgRNA\u2425 promoter was initiated by evaluation of deletions beginning at position \u03ea152 (position 1902 on RNA\u2425) and extending to positions \u03ea119, \u03ea78, \u03ea38, and \u03ea18 upstream of the transcription start site.

Independent experiments have demonstrated the importance of the \u03e91 nt in the sgRNA promoters of a number of well-characterized viruses.

These results indicate that the abundance and timing of transcription of the three Hordeivirus sgRNAs, \u24241, \u24242, and \u2425, may be regulated by promoter sequences that are only distantly related. Alternatively, it is possible that short and/or long distance structural interactions that are not evident in our analyses may have profound roles in promoter timing and activity. It appears that the sgRNA\u24242 promoters of BSMV and PSLV are sufficiently similar for recognition by the BSMV replicase because in vivo studies have revealed that BSMV can support synthesis of PSLV sgRNA\u24242 (Solovyev et al., 1999) . In these studies, a hybrid BSMV RNA\u2424 containing PSLV TGB1, TGB2, and most of the TGB3 sequence was able to replicate and move through the vasculature to uninoculated leaves in plants coinoculated with the \u2423 and \u2425 RNAs (Solovyev et al., 1999) .

These results suggest that the BSMV replicase complex can recognize the related PSLV sgRNA\u24242 promoter, but it either cannot recognize the LRSV sgRNA\u24242 promoter or the LRSV TGB proteins do not form sufficiently compatible interactions to mediate BSMV movement.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1099, "end": 1122, "text": "(Solovyev et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1366, "text": "(Solovyev et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In comparisons of the BSMV sgRNA promoters with the analogous sequences of non-Hordeivirus TGB promoters, we were unable to detect a strong correlation between the putative promoter sequences directing sgRNAs encoding specific TGB proteins.

Moreover, an equivalent degree of limited similarity was also observed in the regions upstream of the unrelated BNYVV p14 and the PCV TGB2 genes. Likewise, the sgRNA\u2425 promoter shares small blocks of common sequence with the region upstream of the PCV p15 gene, which encodes a protein closely related to the \u2425b protein, but the promoter also has similarity to the regions upstream of the unrelated BNYVV TGB1 and TMV p30 genes. The BSMV, BNYVV, PVM, and PCV replicase proteins belong to the supergroup 3 tobamo lineage of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Koonin and Dolja, 1993) , so in these cases it is tempting to speculate that the promoter sequences coevolved in response to the polymerase specificity rather than as a block consisting of the promoter and its associated protein. However, the RdRp proteins of BMV and PVX are also classified in the supergroup 3 tobamo lineage, yet their sgRNA promoter sequences share no apparent similarity to the BSMV promoters.

This is surprising because in other viruses, sgRNA promoter recognition by replicase complexes often requires primary sequence as well as secondary structural elements. These requirements may facilitate diverse interactions between replicase complexes and promoters with limited sequence similarity. In BYDV, both RNA sequence and secondary structure are essential for promoter activity (Koev et al., 1999) . The BYDV sgRNA1 promoter folds into two stem loops downstream of its transcription initiation site, but comparisons with the predicted structures of the sgRNA2 and sgRNA3 promoters reveal that they possess very different sized stem loops downstream of their respective transcription initiation sites . The TMV MP sgRNA promoter also requires a stem loop structure for promoter activity that will tolerate substantial variation in primary sequence without major effects on sgRNA synthesis (Grdzelishvili et al., 2000) . In addition, chemical and enzymatic probing of the 1.45-kb sgRNA promoter of TCV has confirmed the presence of a 96-nt hairpin structure, although only a 21-nt hairpin and a 9-nt flanking single-stranded region comprise the minimal promoter (Wang et al., 1999) .

In the case of sgRNA\u24242, expression increased substantially upon removal of a 48-nt sequence required for sgRNA\u24241 promoter activity. This result suggests that competition for replicase has an important role in mediating the levels of expression of sgRNA\u24241 and sgRNA\u24242. The ectopic expression experiments support this hypothesis because both the ectopic sgRNA\u2425 and the sgRNA\u24242 promoters directed transcription more efficiently in constructs lacking the wt promoters than in constructs with wt promoters. Positioning also appears to have variable effects on promoter activity. Accumulation of sgRNAs transcribed from promoters located close to the 3\u0408 terminus of the genomic-sense RNA was less abundant than those of the wt sgRNA from an upstream promoter. When the sgRNA\u2425, sgRNA\u24241, and sgRNA\u24242 promoters were placed downstream of the wt sgRNA\u24241 promoter in RNA\u2424, the ectopic sgRNAs were considerably reduced in comparisons with the wt sgRNA\u24241 (Fig. 5) . However, in RNA\u2425, the ectopic sgRNA\u2425 promoter strength appeared to be similar to that of the wt sgRNA\u2425 promoter. On the other hand, when the ectopic sgRNA\u24242 promoter was placed downstream of the wt sgRNA\u2425 promoter, the ectopic sgRNA accumulated to much lower levels than the wt sgRNA\u2425 (Fig. 5C) . In contrast to the larger regions encompassing the BSMV sgRNA promoters, the minimal BSMV promoter sequences were unable to function ectopically. These results suggest that positioning, flanking sequences, and, in the case of sgRNA\u24242, an upstream enhancer element may contribute substantially to promoter strength. In particular, the reduction in activity resulting from placement of the BSMV sgRNA promoters near the 3\u0408 end of the genomic RNA contrasts with many examples reported from other RNA viruses where more 3\u0408 located ectopic promoters are preferentially transcribed (French and Ahlquist, 1988; Boccard and Baulcombe, 1993; Wang and Simon, 1997; Koev and Miller, 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1998, "end": 2025, "text": "(French and Ahlquist, 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2026, "end": 2054, "text": "Boccard and Baulcombe, 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2076, "text": "Wang and Simon, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2077, "end": 2099, "text": "Koev and Miller, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1114, "end": 1122, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1419, "text": "(Fig. 5C)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The majority of viruses that contain multiple sgRNA promoters on the same RNA shows a strong correlation between the abundance of their sgRNAs and their proximity to the 3\u0408 end of the genomic RNA (Kelly et al., 1994; Wang and Simon, 1997; Grdzelishvili et al., 2000) .

This pattern of synthesis for TGB sgRNAs has also been demonstrated for Potato virus X (Verchot et al., 1998) and is likely the case for the multicomponent Benyviruses, Furoviruses, Pomoviruses, and Pecluviruses and the monopartite Carlaviruses, Allexiviruses, and Foveaviruses (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) , which contain related TGBs. During replication of BSMV, PVX, and BNYVV, two sgRNAs are generated for translation of the overlapping TGB proteins. The relatively high abundance of sgRNA1 reflects the accumulation of the TGB1 protein during the early stages of infection, whereas the 3\u0408 proximal sgRNA\u24242 is often difficult to detect Jackson, 1996a, 1996b; Verchot et al., 1998) .

These varied interactions may also help explain the temporal regulation of the sgRNA promoters in the same virus.

The resulting derivative was partially digested with SspI, digested with SmaI, and religated to generate the \u24242 \u03e9 9/SspI clone. For large-scale mapping of the sgRNA\u24242 promoter, the \u24241\u03ea34/\u03e914 cDNA clone was used in conjunction with the \u24242-specific oligonucleotides listed in Table 1 to engineer unique KpnI sites upstream of the sgRNA\u24242 promoter at positions \u03ea110, \u03ea76, \u03ea52, and \u03ea28.
