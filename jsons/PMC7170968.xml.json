We used population densities, proportion of the population living in urban areas, and populations delineated by 3 age groups: 0\u201314 years, 15\u201364 years, and \u226565 years. Furthermore, we considered daily new cases (>10) up to the first reported peak of COVID-19 cases and the corresponding date ranges for all the countries for which such data were available. This range of days varied between 8 and 16 days (Table 1). We use 2 coupled differential equations  and , where s(t) and k(t) represent susceptible and infected at time t, and \u03b2 is the transmission rate that is assumed to be invariant within the range of days for which the infection numbers in each country were computed. The respective \u03b2 values per 100,000 thousands for the age groups 15\u201364 years and \u226565+ years considered for various countries are as follows: China: 0.8\u00d71.5  and 1.5, 0.75; Italy: 1.5 and 3.0; Iran: 1.5 and 9.0; South Korea: 2.25 and 4.50; France: 1.50 and 3.0; Spain: 3.0 and 6.0; Germany: 1.5 and 3.0; and the United States: 0.75 and 1.5. The difference between model-predicted numbers and the actual numbers reported within the range were treated as underreported, which includes underdiagnosed cases. We constructed the Meyer wavelets for the reported and adjusted data after adjusting the infected number in the population for underreporting. The Meyer wavelet is a differentiable function, \u03c8(\u03c9), which is infinitely differentiable in the domain with a function u as follows:\n",

We also had no clear idea of the duration that SARS-CoV-2 virus remains active on nonliving surfaces such as plastics, metals, paper, etc; thus, we did not consider the interaction between humans and nonliving surfaces. Mathematical modeling can be made more complex by adding more parameters, but caution is necessary to ensure that these studies are well designed and that these parameters use readily available, scientifically collected data. Once we obtain more data on the duration of COVID-19 living on nonliving surfaces, we can build more complex models with more parameters.",
