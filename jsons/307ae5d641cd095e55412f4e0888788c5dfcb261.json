            "text": "The following paper seeks to understand Donald Trump as a \"dialectical image\" for the contradictions of neoliberal capitalism. Trump's management style, as described in his Art of the Deal, combines a fetishizing of entrepreneurial risk as a \"lifestyle\" with the insistence that it is not the entrepreneur but his targets who are ultimately exposed to risk. This suggests that we might understand the elevation of \"deal-making\" to a lifestyle as a characteristic of modernity that, with neoliberalism, is increasingly coming to the fore. Such a critique of modernity, I further argue, is anticipated by Fichte's Closed Commercial State with its intriguing dialectic of risk. I conclude by arguing that Trump's politics marks the rise of a new, specifically American style of Fascism-one that demands identification not with the state as supra-individual collective, but with an impersonal system governing over individual lives and rendering them precarious.",

Indeed, if the phenomenon of Trump brings the present conjuncture into an unprecedented focus, it is precisely insofar as the situation of the present is not merely of the present, but issues from, and indeed carries over, the contradictions of the past-contradictions that are dialectical, in the sense of Walter Benjamin, insofar as they reveal an order of emergent temporality, of the time of the event as one might say, that is radically discontinuous with the continuous order of progress.",

In a single moment, that which had appeared impossible, having no place in the world, not only suddenly seems inevitable and necessary, but draws everything else into its field of attraction, allowing other things to appear only in relation to it. A modal logician might, of course, still insist that there could be a possible world without Lady Gaga, Obama, or Trump: but this world, this absolutely singular world in which we exist-and we have never quite had the luxury of existing in another, merely possible world-has become utterly unthinkable without them, since the entire horizon of sense has come to be warped around the facts of their existence as if around a black hole.",

This is in part because the seeming triviality of celebrity phenomena, and indeed of everything, however enormous its impact, which has been relegated to the sphere of private life (e.g., the personal computer, social networking), serves a function similar to that of the stage's proscenium: it creates the illusion of a safe distance (the distance, indeed, of illusion) in relation to what is in fact threateningly close. Many, such as Inglis (2010) , have recognized that celebrity (as opposed to fame, renown) is characteristically modern, or indeed, as Rojek (2004) argues, ineluctably woven into the fabric of contemporary society. But perhaps the phenomenon of celebrity itself, together with all that is subsumed within its orbit, might be regarded not simply as a consequence of modernity, but as a \"coping mechanism,\" a reaction formation, that, as such, has itself made it possible to survive the condition of modernity and postmodernity. It is a way of processing historical change itself, insofar as it has already reached a feverish and traumatic pitch of intensity, into safer, less threatening forms: a cutification of historical time, as it were. The continuum-breaking irruption of the new becomes novelty-an object of contemplative pleasure, enjoyment, intrigue, fascination.",

Since Trump was already a celebrity in the 1980s, and indeed, as a celebrity businessman, already straddled two worlds and unsettled the protecting veil of illusion (and it is instructive, in this way, to take note of the two domains over which he claims his tasteless mastery: television and architecture-intimately related and yet polar opposites), his ascent to politician, indeed to \"leader of the free world,\" involves a second-order shock, a second-order event: it is as if the entire order bound up in the phenomenon of celebrity has become the only thing it never could have been before: real. The enormity of this event must be recognized for what it is. Whatever else happens, and it is perhaps still too soon to tell, this has already happened: the logic of celebrification, transforming the event into novelty-the \"domestication\" and \"cutification\" of historical time itself-having served as the principal shock absorber for the shocks of modernity, has, in a shocking and sudden fashion, failed. There is now only celebrity, or no celebrity. Celebrity has become a quantitative, rather than qualitative factor, as is made evident when one considers how the various ranking schemes organizing social media allow a hitherto impossible comparison between, say, a teenage girl in Topeka, Kansas live-feeding videos of her cat to her ten \"followers\"-or even the cat itself-and Lady Gaga with her millions of minions. Before we thought of celebrities as outliers, deviations from a human norm; now we think of even ourselves as failed celebrities. There are now only monsters, little and big; no one, and perhaps nothing-not even animals (one thinks of Cecil the Lion)-that are still able to exist at all if they exist outside the monstrations of media. And hence there is also no reality-authoritative, serious, secure-beyond the veil of celebrity, save perhaps in the most intimate, disgusting facets of daily life. It is in this way that we might make sense of the recent somewhat hyperbolic talk about \"post-truth.\" It is not that correspondence truth has suddenly disappeared from the world, or even that the norms guiding most forms of praxis and discourse have been undermined. Rather, what has happened is this: previously, media interfaced with the real by way of a strata of authorities who, themselves media figures and celebrities, were nevertheless able to set up a protective barrier between the mediascape and the realscape by offering an authorized, authority-bearing opinion. Regardless what this opinion was, and whose interests (state, corporate, ideological) it represented, its demonstrative authoritativeness, buttressed by serious gazes and steady, stentorian tones, served to keep the two worlds apart: daytime TV might be dominated by all manner of triviality, silliness, melodrama, but, come evening, when the men have returned home from work and families are gathered back together, Walter Cronkite would remind everyone that, far away, a war was being fought, that their neighbors' sons were dying, that students were protesting, that the world was changing. The shocks of real history, this is to say, were tied back to the comforting continuity of authoritative knowledge, sound common sense, abiding ethical, political, juridical norms, whereas the novelty of the event-always already corresponding to nothing, the event is always already \"post-truth\"-was relegated to the sphere of the trivial and ephemeral. Now, however, this mediating function-called into question from both the top down and the bottom up, squeezed from all sides-has lost much of its efficacy: it is becoming increasingly clear that not only, as the prophets of postmodernity anticipated, is there no outside to the media, but that the qualitative texturing-the topographic distinctions-within the mediascape have been flattened out, such that they remain mere quantitative signifers of qualitative differences, akin to the markings on a topographic map.",

Perhaps the most fundamental methodological principle of this investigation is the belief, grounded in the remarks of the previous paragraphs, that, in order to gain access to the dialectical torsion at work, it is necessary to start out by juxtaposing something seemingly trivial and ephemeral with that which brings the further-reaching historical horizon into view. Hence I will attempt to read Trump starting from what might seem like an unlikely constellation: on the one hand, his board games and, on the other, Fichte's highly philosophical political-economic treatise on the Closed Commercial State, a text which may be regarded as the founding document of economic nationalism insofar as it defends the necessity of restrictions on commerce, going far beyond the tactics of mercantilism, not in terms of the comparative advantages to be gained by one party over another, but in terms of what is absolutely necessary for the sovereign nation state to exist. Even though the \"economic nationalism\" of Trump and Bannon shares almost nothing concrete with Fichte's proposals, it does draw, at least at an ideological level, on principles that find very pure expression in Fichte's treatise. This is nowhere so clear than in Trump's infamous promise to \"build a wall and make Mexico pay for it.\" This expresses the very essence of Fichtean closure-Fichte too believes he can make other countries pay-hollowed out into a purely rhetorical gesture. This is, needless to say, only one possible approach to the complex phenomenon that is Trump and Trumpism, and yet its seemingly willful arbitrariness is precisely what is methodologically demanded: only a chance point of departure can offer a point of access to that which relentlessly undermines all the resources of sound political, juridical, scientific reasoning.",

Trump, 45 th President of the USA, is not only the first head of state of a world power to have hosted his own reality show but can also claim the distinction of having not one, not two, but at least three board games consecrated to his name: \"Donald Trump: The Game,\" \"I'm Back and Your Fired,\" and the \"Apprentice Board Game.\" Given that the first of these predates his reality TV show \"The Apprentice\" by 15 years, this suggests a certain telos driving the peculiar phenomenon that is Donald Trump-it could even seem as though, if the survival-format reality show had not existed, Trump would have had to invent it. 1 The fulfillment of Donald Trump is to become the game-master, the dealer-the house. And yet this is perhaps not quite as simple as it might seem: the house is the structure, the system, the law. Those who play the game are submitted to contingency; they must compete with one another and are exposed to all the moods that go with the ups and downs of fortune. The house-the system, the structure-by contrast, like the divine beings of which the German poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin writes, feels nothing, experiences nothing. If it is possible to occupy the position of the house, it is only by becoming inhuman; incapable of human pleasure. Trump, however, seems to want it both ways: he wants to be the house, free of risk but also free of joy, and he wants to be a winner, the biggest winner. He wants to be both the dealer and the one who deals consummately with that which has been dealt.",

            "text": "Precisely this double desire is articulated throughout Trump's The Art of The Deal. From its first pages, Trump claims that his animating desire-the ultimate good orienting all his choices and actions-is neither wealth nor even (as one might suspect now more than ever, and which is certainly in fact the case) power: I don't do it for the money. I've got enough, much more than I'll ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks (Trump and Schwartz 1987) . 1 Regarding the significance of Trump's career as reality TV host, see Ouellette (2016) , Hearn (2016 Hearn ( , 2017 and Kavka (2018) . General studies of reality TV, and its transformative impact on American society, include Hill (2014) and Deery (2015) , as well as the edited collection by Murray and Ouellette (2004) . But perhaps the most profound and trenchant reflection on Reality TV, with regard to the 1971 show An American Family, appears in Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation: \"Ideal heroine of the American way of life, it is, as in ancient sacrifices, chosen in order to be glorified and to die beneath the flames of the medium, a modern fatum. Because heavenly fire no longer falls on corrupted cities, it is the camera lens that, like a laser, comes to pierce living reality in order to put it to death\" (1994).",

It determines a form of life in the fullest sense. In the first book of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle speaks of three ways of life that hold a special prominence, gathering together and illuminating our varied paths as human beings upon the face of the earth: the life of pleasure, the political life (the life of honor or of virtue), and the contemplative life. (Aristotle 2002) Each of these lives is oriented around a \"good\" that can coherently present itself as the meaningful, and meaning-giving, end of human action. By contrast: \"the life of money making is a type of compulsory activity, and it is clear that wealth is not the good being sought, since it is instrumental and for the sake of something else.\" (Aristotle 2002 ) For Trump, it would seem, deal-making is a fourth kind of life.",

So we might say, rather, that the life of deal-making is a version of the creative life, made possible, as Hannah Arendt (1998) had argued in The Human Condition, by the post-Classical ascendance of homo faber. Or finally, drawing together these two points, we could even say that deal-making exemplifies the way in which political life is transformed through the rise of homo faber. Yet this conclusion does not seem quite adequate, either, since as Hannah Arendt argues, the modern world is characterized by the rise of homo laborans and the suppression of both the life of making as well as activity.

The deal-master tries to experience the deal and master the deal at one and the same time. He tries to master the deal by forethought, anticipation of risk, and yet the greatest degree of forethought brings us before a risk, a fragility to things, that cannot be surmounted. So it would seem the deal-maker must live for the present; the life of the deal is not a life of art, of creativity, but a life of pleasure. The temporal horizon of the deal-maker collapses into the present. And yet it is also not clear if the deal-maker can ever actually experience the pleasure of the moment. \"It never stops, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present. That's where the fun is. And if it can't be fun, what's the point.\" (Trump and Schwartz 1987) One can only live in the moment, but the moment only exists in the future. Ultimately, fun is had only in the past: the life of deal-making lives fully in a present that only ever exists in the future, and only ever knows that it has lived at all by looking back at all the fun it has had. Fun, in fact, is not something we feel, something we enjoy, but something that is made, bought, had: the commodity form of pleasure.",

One might speak, in this way, of a psychopathology of everyday life, though perhaps in a sense that owes as much to Heidegger as to Freud. What is most interesting about this account is that it shows the pathology from the side of the winner, the absolute winner. Usually, capitalist pathologies start from the side of the \"losers\"; failed salesmen, drug addicts, compulsive gamblers, neurotics of all shapes and stripes. 3 Now, it is possible to see that the pathology of the loser is merely a special case, and limiting case, of the pathology of the winner. Yet what interests me above all is the way in which this pathology already manifests itself in Fichte's thought-and not simply as a private quirk, an idiosyncrasy, but as the constitutive horizon of German idealism, and even of modern philosophy as such; a horizon that continues to play itself out not only in Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, but even in Heidegger\u2026 This is not meant as a critique ad hominem; it speaks to the greatness of a thinker to bring forth the ruling characteristics of the age, even if this is itself pathological.",

The tension between necessity and contingency, as also between autonomy and heteronomy, comes to the fore. German idealism regards this tension as generative, productive, and ultimately seeks a systematic reconciliation. Heidegger, in turn, following Schelling and Nietzsche and also H\u00f6lderlin, returns to this tension but makes it irreducible, fundamental, starting with his \"existential\" analysis of thrownness and projection.

Precisely because Fichte regards the fundamental tendency of his age not as one countervailing factor among others in a progressively unfolding historical dialectic, but as an extreme horizon in which the very possibility of any sort of goal-directed action is called into question, he must reject the view of the political, given brilliant expression two decades later with Hegel's Elements of the Philosophy of Right, as the reconciliation of the freedom and particularity of the individual with the abstract universality of the state.",

Citizens will be forbidden from freely engaging in economic activity with foreign entities, and indeed travel abroad will only be permitted to scholars and artists. Even though this vision of the state might seem perversely anti-modern, Fichte indeed regards it as the culmination of the historical process of modernity: the emergence of the sovereign nation state reveals a tendency toward closure, and yet the merely juridical closure of the Westphalian state is not enough, and must be supplemented by complete economic closure. In a powerful and prescient analysis of the global order of colonial relations, Fichte argues that these are not only fundamentally exploitative, but that they must ultimately lead to the complete destitution of weak nations, which, as a result of trade imbalances, will ultimately be compelled to sell their own sovereignty to the highest bidder.",

Here, he claims that mercantilism itself represented a series of halfmeasures undertaken in pursuit of economic closure. If one were to consider the passage cited above with a view only to the argument pursued in the first two books, Fichte's reasoning would seem peculiar if not altogether bizarre. On the one hand: there would seem little or no point in offering a proposal that is so contrary to the spirit of the age and its tendencies. On the other hand: if the tendency of the present age is toward closure, then this would not only suggest that the present age is more serious than might first seem to be the case, but that indeed the relation of the playful and the serious, as modes of existence, is more complex than Fichte's closing words suggests. Or perhaps indeed, if playfulness is itself a necessary step driving the species forward, then this might imply that the playful wheeling and dealing man of the present is in fact the agent of world history's very serious intentions, whereas Fichte's economic philosophy, in all its ponderous heavy Teutonic seriousness, is a non-starter.

The first state that does this will reap tremendous benefits, instantly nearly doubling its wealth, since its gold will be freed up from its function as a domestic means of exchange. It will be able to acquire tremendous military power, which it can and must use for the sole purpose of claiming the natural boundaries needed for a self-sufficient economic existence. Other states, seeing this, will follow, though they will benefit less than the first. Eventually, all states will be compelled to close themselves off economically just to survive.",

Fichte does not spend much time on these risks, but this is not because he does not take them seriously, but rather because he is concerned above all with \"selling\" his proposal to those who are in a position of power. He, we might say, is convinced that the danger that the present world faces is so great that only this sort of gamble could lead us back from the abyss. What he fears most of all is that the very economic conditions which allow for a noble, free, truly human existence will be destroyed. In the best tradition of the philosophers, he is afraid for philosophy, for the dignity of contemplative human reason. And yet it is precisely the characteristic of the present age, its love of risk and gambles and tricks and cunning, that makes Fichte's world-historical wager possible. Only a world that loves to gamble could find a statesman crazy enough to gamble everything. But what is the payoff: peace on earth-among states and within each state's own territory. An abrupt end to the dynamism of history; the substitution of the madness of history with a gentle, stable progress based on the peaceful, but very limited interactions of nation states, each with its own welldefined, rich national character.",

            "text": "Almost two centuries before Francis Fukayama, and more than a 100 years before Kojeve, Fichte envisions the end of history. And yet the end of history will not be brought forth more or less of its own accord through the ruse of history, driving forward through suffering and contradiction toward the absolute, but through the ruse of Fichte. Perhaps, had Fichte not existed, another great thinker would have figured out the \"money operation\"-yet whoever discovers it, and however long this takes, it will always involve an event that intervenes in the existing order of things, catalyzing a chain reaction of occurrences that will leave the world utterly transformed. 5 This event is not destined or necessitated in any way; it is an intervention and an invention: a fundamentally new kind of currency, imposed from the top down, introducing a new kind of numismatic regime, a new sovereignty beyond all sovereignty. 6 For Fichte, true property must issue in free activity. He indeed believes that the fundamental error of all existing theories of property consists in the fact that \"one posits the first, original property in the exclusive possession of a thing.\" Against this, his theory maintains that \"the first and original property, the basis of all others, [consists] in an exclusive right to a determinate free activity.\" (Fichte 2013 ) But if we take this Idealistic theory of property, already developed with great consequence, seriously, then we might ask: how is it that the human race appropriates its own history, such that it can become most fully the property of itself in its historical existence-or such that, indeed, its historical existence could be the very event of self-appropriation. This is a vital question, a necessary question, since without this historical self-appropriation human freedom would amount to nothing. The thought of the early \"humanistic\" Marx still operates within the horizon of this question, and it is perhaps still even at work in Heidegger's Ereignis-the propriative event. Here, however, the difference between Fichte and Hegel comes into striking view. For Hegel: history is the ongoing process by which absolute spirit appropriates itself, passing from dunamis to energeia. It is in just this sense, indeed, that Hegel could have never actually entertained an \"end to history\" in any simple sense. For Fichte, by contrast: the highest appropriative event is the wager of the philosopher-statesman; the wager to end all wagers, and hence end a history that has been characterized by chance. There is in this way a kind of Platonism at work in Fichte: the philosopher is the one who, owing nothing to the world in which he was born, precipitates an event of conversion; the first in the chain of liberating actions. Human beings can only take ownership of their historical existence, hence of their humanity, by acting in a decisive way against the riskiness in which their existence is enmeshed. And yet such a decision, which need in fact only happen once and can originate with one visionary, is itself risky to the highest degree. It is only possible as the highest wager. The secret motto of Fichte's Closed Commercial State is, one could almost say, the H\u014dlderlinian bon mot, coined 2 years later, that Heidegger, writing in the wake of the devastation of the Second World War, draws on in The Question Concerning Technology: \"Wo aber Gefahr ist, w\u00e4chst das Rettende auch\"-where the danger is, there too is salvation, the saving power.",

Speculative thought is risk-taking thought; the speculative desire of the philosopher is of a piece with the characteristic of the age. Indeed, Fichte recognizes as much when, claiming that many wrongly blame poetry and philosophy for the frivolousness of the age, he remarks that poetry and philosophy are not responsible for this phenomenon, but merely serve, in the case of the former, \"to divert [it] toward something else than life,\" and, in the case of the latter, to challenge \"it to the extent that it concerns itself with life.\" This can only mean that, in its proper domain-beyond the sphere of ordinary life-philosophy remains playful.",

Donald Trump, at once master of the game and master-player, offers the perfect point for a new mode of identification, in which we identify ourselves not with the state, the collective, by sacrificing our claim to individual autonomy and rights, but rather identify ourselves, in our atomized individuality, with the system that governs our lives, dispenses with our lives, without either demanding sacrifice or offering the hope of rediscovering our individuality in the universal. We take pleasure in the system, live vicariously through the system, even though this itself inevitably condemns us, however much fun we have along the way, to lose. 7 It is in this sense that we can understand Trump's economic nationalism. On the one hand, it is the very opposite of Fichte's; it has nothing to do with securing economic rights and economic justice through even a limited recognition of the responsibility of the state to provide its citizens with the possibility of a livelihood sufficient to allow for a dignified, fully human life. It has nothing to do, even, as some in the alt-right might have it, with the \"cultural\" integrity of the nation state. Rather: Trump's economic nationalism follows from the elevation of the president to the \"deal-maker-in-chief\"; economic relations between nations, this is to say, are mere occasions for the leader to show off his deal-making prowess, and this, in turn, serves to allow for popular identification with the one who is able to play the game, enjoy the game, and master it at the same time; who can keep on playing the game and yet can never lose.",

            "text": "In the case of Trump, of course, this identification itself only happens through various exclusions: of the racial and ethnic and sexual, of foreigners, of \"liberals,\" of women who refuse objectification, and now of the elderly, the urban poor, and those with \"preexisting conditions,\" all of whose lives, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, have become expendable in the rush to \"reopen\" the economy. While it is this aspect of Trump's political style that has provoked the greatest degree of public outrage, it also suggests a point of vulnerability in the logic of late capitalism. For what it reveals, above all, is that it is still largely impossible to identify with the system, to take pleasure in the system, without these gestures of exclusion. It might be tempting to claim that this is because the logic of exclusion is itself structurally necessary to the system. Yet while it may well be the case that capitalism at once depends on and gives rise to stratifications that fall outside the strict logic of class conflict, the tendency of capitalism remains directed at the dissolution (at least at the level of the explicit, public ideology) of all \"qualitative\" distinctions, since these will inevitably stand in the way of the maximization of profit. What Trump has made clear, in a particularly brutal fashion, is that, while it is increasingly necessary to identify with the system, since all other forms of life have become hollowed out and can no longer offer a path to enjoyment and happiness, it is also, at least for a broad section of the population, impossible to identify with the system in its outermost purity and abstraction. To become \"relatable,\" to become \"livable,\" the system must again become precisely what it no longer is: a nation, an ethnicity, a race. Thus, in the eyes of many, the system has become divided into two systems, one good, one evil: the radically impersonal system of capitalism itself impersonated in the ethno-racial state and ultimately in the felicitous and happy image of the businessowner-Trump himself is a small businessman grown to monstrous proportions-and the radically impersonal system of the deep state, impersonated in the scheming agent, the journalist, the cultural-Marxist Jew. The need for this impersonation, and the surge of explicitly exclusionary idioms back into mainstream national politics, itself results from the failure of the project of division and identification that, since the end of the Second World War, conservatism in the United States and England has pursued: of the good system of life-affirming, creative entrepreneurial capitalism versus the bad system of totalitarianism and government regulation. Yet the complete failure of Trump to do anything, beyond adventuresome grandstanding in the global arena, to challenge the unfettered dominion of corporate interests suggests that the ethno-racial and nationalist impersonation of capitalism is just a mask for neoliberalism, which remains in force.",
