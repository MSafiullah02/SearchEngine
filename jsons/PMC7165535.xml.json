Opportunistic infections of the gastrointestinal tract are responsible for 68\u201385% of both acute and chronic cases of diarrhoea in HIV\u2010infected patients[1, 2, 3]. The principle opportunistic pathogens include cryptosporidia, microsporidia, mycobacteria and cytomegalovirus in addition to conventional pathogens found in the immunocompetent. Gut autonomic neuropathy[4], bacterial overgrowth[5,\n6] or HIV enteropathy[7] may account for a small proportion of the remaining so called \u2018pathogen\u2010negative\u2019 cases of diarrhoea.",

Enteric viral infection has been increasingly recognized as a cause of both endemic and epidemic diarrhoeal disease[8,\n9]. Rotavirus, adenovirus and coxsackie virus have been implicated as causative agents of diarrhoea in primary immunodeficiency disease[10] and in immunosuppressed bone marrow recipients[11]. Adenovirus has been reported as a disseminated infection in AIDS and isolated from brain, lung and liver samples. However, the main manifestations of this infection appear to be in the gastrointestinal tract[12], where this and other enteric viruses can be isolated from the stool and intestinal tissue. Clear consensus about the role of enteric viruses in acute and chronic infection in HIV patients does not exist[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Few data exist regarding the natural history of these infections and their possible association with other pathogens. Adenovirus infection of colonic tissue has been described[19,\n20], but it is unclear whether \u2018adenovirus colitis\u2019 is responsible for symptoms in this group of patients.",

The overall prevalence of enteric viruses in this study (15.9%) is similar to that of Schmidt et al.[18], who found an overall prevalence of 17% (6.6% adenovirus) using electron microscopy in a similar cohort of patients. Reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction techniques are becoming available for the detection of some enteric viruses and are likely to be more sensitive than the electron microscopic techniques employed in this study.

Using a previously validated investigative protocol to identify co\u2010infection with known pathogens[21] we found that 25/29 (86%) of unselected HIV patients with enteric virus infection had associated acute diarrhoeal episodes (less than 4 weeks\u2019 duration). In contrast, the presence of a concurrent gut pathogen known to cause diarrhoeal symptoms in the immunosuppressed was associated with chronic diarrhoea (P = 0.004). Data on viral carriage in asymptomatic patients in our study population are not available and we cannot therefore be certain of a causal role of these viruses in HIV\u2010related diarrhoea. We also have reservations about the accuracy of analysis of formed stool. However, the strong association between acute diarrhoea and the presence of enteric viruses without evidence of other pathogens suggests this association. Three previous studies have suggested an association between enteric viral carriage and diarrhoea[13,\n14,\n18]. In other studies no association has been found[16,\n19,\n22], which may be explained in part by their focus on chronic diarrhoea as opposed to acute diarrhoea. Establishing a pathogenic role for enteric viruses in HIV\u2010related diarrhoea is likely to remain difficult, in view of the occurrence of asymptomatic shedding of virus and the high rate of concurrent enteric pathogens in this group of patients, particularly those with chronic diarrhoea.",

This is in contrast with a previous report in which adenovirus and coronavirus infections were found to occur at similar median CD4 counts (20 and 67 cells/\u03bcl, respectively)[18]. Several other studies have found evidence of increasing prevalence of enteric viral infection with increasing immunosuppression[14, 15, 16,\n23].

This condition has been termed \u2018adenovirus colitis\u2019 and is poorly understood, with published material limited to case reports[19,\n20]. The clinical significance of adenovirus colitis has not been established. We therefore compared cases of adenovirus colitis identified from histological records with those in whom adenovirus was identified in stool. Cases were matched for CD4 counts, antiviral therapy and the presence of concurrent gut pathogens. In the adenovirus/stool group 14/23 patients had acute diarrhoea compared to 6/21 in the adenovirus colitis group (P = 0.03). There is a potential bias towards a rectal biopsy in patients with chronic diarrhoea and hence a diagnosis of adenovirus colitis. These results suggest that a proportion of patients develop overt mucosal inflammation in association with adenovirus infection and may go on to develop chronic diarrhoea. Further work is required to characterize adenovirus isolates from patients with adenovirus colitis. Subgenus F serotype 40 adenovirus has been associated with symptomatic gastrointestinal infection, and data from a seroprevalence study suggest the recently proposed adenovirus serotypes 48 and 49 may be endemic among gay men and sexual transmission is the likely source of exposure[24,\n25].",

Adenovirus infection has previously been associated with increased frequency of co\u2010infections[18] and a facilitator role for the virus has been suggested[26]. We postulate that the cytopathic damage to the colonic epithelium caused by adenovirus, which may be extensive, may predispose to CMV infection.
