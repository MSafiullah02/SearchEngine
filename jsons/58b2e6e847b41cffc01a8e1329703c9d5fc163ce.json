In this chapter, we present a near real-time sentiment analysis service of public health-related tweets. Traditionally, it is impossible for humans to effectively measure the degree of public health concerns due to limited resources and significant time delays. To solve this problem, we have developed a computational intelligence approach for Epidemic Sentiment Monitoring System (ESMOS) to automatically analyze the disease sentiments and gauge the Measure of Concern (MOC) expressed by Twitter users. More specifically, we present a knowledge-based approach that employs a disease ontology to detect the outbreak of diseases and to analyze the linguistic expressions that convey subjective expressions and sentiment polarity of emotions, feelings, opinions, personal attitudes, etc. with a sentiment classifier. The two-step sentiment classification method utilizes the subjective vocabulary corpus (MPQA), sentiment strength corpus (AFINN), as well as emoticons and profanity words that are often used in social media postings. It first automatically classifies the tweets into personal and non-personal classes, eliminating many tweets such as non-personal \"retweets\" of news articles from further consideration. In the second stage, the personal tweets are classified into Negative and non-Negative sentiments. In addition, we present a model to quantify the public's Measure of Concern (MOC) about a disease, based on sentiment classification results. The trends of the public MOC are visualized on a timeline. Correlation analyses between MOC timeline and disease-related sentiment category timelines show that the peaks of the MOC are 425 426 X.

Their thread of research led to the realization that an aggregation of large numbers of queries might show patterns that are useful for the early detection of epidemics. However, comprehensive access to search engine logs is limited to the search engine providers. Twitter, a popular social network site, has more than 500 million users out of which more than 302 million are active users [10] . This shows Twitter's potential to address the limitations of traditional public health surveillance methods, and of search keyword logs. A percentage of Twitter messages are publicly available and researchers are able to retrieve the tweets as well as related information through the Twitter API [11] .",

The MOC increases with the relative growth of Personal Negative tweets and with the absolute growth of Personal Negative tweets. Previous research [17, 18] visually noticed that sentiment surges co-occurred with health events on a timeline. Different from the previous work, which is based on visual observation, we correlated the peaks on the MOC timeline (i.e., change over time) and the peaks of the News timeline and also the peaks of the Non-Negative timeline and the peaks of News timeline using the Jaccard Coefficient [19] . Government officials can use MOC to track public health concerns on the timeline to help make timely decisions, disprove rumors, intervene, and prevent unnecessary social crises at the earliest possible stage. More importantly, public health concern monitoring using social network data is faster and cheaper than the traditional method.",

It monitors social media data (specifically, Twitter data) and \"recognizes\" and collects tweets about publichealth related diseases. ESMOS then analyzes the data to automatically classify them into sentiment categories, and calculates the public degree of concerns for a particular disease outbreak and its spread. ESMOS also provides visual tools such as the intensity map (heat map) of sentiments to understand the geographic distribution and concentration of public concerns, and a health concern trending map to be able to track the public health concerns over time. The trending map will also allow users to compare collected tweets with the disease-associated news events to qualitatively investigate how the news coverage may influence the public concern. Figure 1 shows the component architecture of ESMOS. The goal of computational intelligence is to build cognitive systems that can act like and interact with humans, to provide insights and intelligence that are needed in complex problem solving and decision-making situations. Cognitive systems [20] structured and unstructured data and learn specific domain knowledge by experience, much in the same way humans do. Cognitive systems use Natural Language Processing and image and speech recognition to understand the world and to interact with humans and other smart systems seamlessly. Unlike many expert systems, cognitive systems not only match and fire pre-defined rules with anticipated possible actions, but also can be trained using AI and Machine Learning methods to sense, integrate, analyze, predict and reason as human brains do for various tasks.",

However, all DO disease terms may be used, given sufficient computational resources. The core component uses the Twitter Streaming API for collecting epidemics-related real-time tweets. The advantage of using the Disease Ontology is that it is linked to medical terminology codes in other ontologies with a set of synonyms. For instance, the Ebola virus is known under different labels. It has the following synonyms and cross-references with three of the most important medical terminology collections: NCI, SNOMED CT and UMLS: The use of other collections of medical terms (e.g. Wikipedia's list of ICD-9 codes 001-139: infectious and parasitic diseases [22] ) may further support the purpose. The major issue with the use of formal ontologies of medical terms is that the laymen's disease terms (e.g. Ebola) may have to be matched with the scientific terms used in medical terminologies (e.g. Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever) [23] .

We used the valence ratings in the AFINN lexicon to further distinguish the Personal Negative from Personal Non-Negative tweets. Our goal is to develop an automated sentiment analysis system for the social heath tweets generated by the general public. This system can provide public health officials with the capability to monitor the viral effects in social media communication, so that they can take early actions to prevent unnecessary panic regarding public health related diseases.",

Firstly, Twitter messages were classified into either positive/negative or positive/negative/ neutral with the assumption that all Twitter messages express ones' opinion. However, this assumption does not hold in many situations, especially when the tweets are about epidemics or more broadly, about crises. In these situations, as we found when we randomly sampled 100 tweets, many tweets (up to 30 %) of the samples, are repetitions of the News without any personal opinion. Since they are not explicitly labeled with re-tweet symbols, it is not easy for a stop-word based pre-processing filter to detect them. We attempt to solve a different problem, which is how to classify tweets into three categories: Personal Negative tweets, Personal Non-Negative tweets, and News tweets (tweets that are non-Personal tweets).",

Salathe and Khandelwal [45] also identified irrelevant tweets together with sentiment classifications. Without considering irrelevant tweets, they calculated the H1N1 vaccine sentiment score from the relative difference of positive and negative messages. In our two-step classification method, we can automatically extract News tweets and perform the sentiment analysis. The results of sentiment classification are used for computing the correlation between sentiments and News trends. In this way, the goals of sentiment classification and measuring the public concern can be achieved in an integrated framework. Secondly, although sophisticated models were developed by the above research, the results of the sentiment classification were not utilized to provide insights. We provide the Measure of Concern timeline trends as a useful sentiment monitoring tool for public health specialists and government decision makers.",

            "text": "Sentiment quantification is a method to process unstructured text and generate a numerical value or a timeline of numerical values to gain insights into the sentiment trends. Zhuang et al. [46] generated a quantification of sentiments about movie elements, such as special effects, plot, dialogue, etc. Their quantification contains a positive score and a negative score towards a specific movie element. For tweet-level sentiment quantification on a timeline, Chew and Eysenbach [47] used a statistical approach to computing the relative proportion of all tweets expressing concerns about H1N1 and visualized the temporal trend of positive/negative sentiments based on their proportion. Similar research was done by O'Connor et al. [48] , in which they calculated a daily (positive and negative) sentiment score by recording the number of positive and negative words of one tweet appearing in the subjectivity lexicon of OpinionFinder [31] . Sha et al. [17] found that the sentiment fluctuations on Sina Weibo were associated with either the new policy announcements or government actions. The drawbacks of the existing Twitter sentiment quantification research are twofold. Firstly, the lexicon-based sentiment extraction models have limited coverage of words. As pointed out by Wiebe and Riloff [49] , identifying positive or negative tweets by counting words in a dictionary or lexicon usually has high precision but low recall. In the case of Twitter sentiment analysis, the performance suffers more. The lexicon or dictionary does not contain the slang words that are common in social media. For example, LMAO (Laughing My A** Off), is a positive \"word\" in Twitter, but it does not match any word in MPQA [25] , which is a popular sentiment dictionary. In this study, we consider these profanity or slang words as well as the emoticons. Secondly, the existing sentiment quantification work [17, 48] has shown the correlation between sentiments and real-world events (e.g. news) through observing their co-occurrence on a timeline, but has not provided a comprehensive, quantitative correlation between the sentiment timeline trend and the News timeline trend. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work that both quantitatively and qualitatively studies these correlations between Twitter sentiment and the News in Twitter to identify concerns caused by diseases and crises.",

As shown in Fig. 3 , the sentiment classification problem is approached in two steps. First, for all English tweets we separated Personal from News (Non-Personal) tweets. Second, after the Personal tweets were extracted by the most successful of the Personal/News Machine Learning classifier, these Personal tweets were used as input to another Machine Learning classifier, to identify Personal Negative tweets and Personal Non-Negative tweets.

For coverage, this previous method only considered the existence of profanity and emoticons, but it did not take into account the frequency of them. A single use of a profanity word is relatively common for Twitter users to express their emotions, but multiple uses of profanity words indicate a strong negative sentiment. In addition, the number of profanity words or emoticons is relatively small, since the profanity list contains \"only\" 340 words and the emoticon list consists of 33 emoticons. It is quite possible to miss potential Personal Negative or Personal Non-Negative tweets with this approach. For the sentiment strength, this previous method only considered the existence of profanity or emoticon, but did not consider the various sentiment strengths of words, which are good indicators for the tweet sentiment detection. In this chapter, to address these previous limitations, we have developed a new Personal Negative versus Personal Non-Negative labeling method. This new method uses metrics generated from the AFINN lexicon as shown in Table 3 , in addition to emoticons and profanities. AFINN [26] is a publicly available list of 2,477 English words and phrases rated for valence with an integer between \u22125 (negative) and +5 (positive). To label a Personal tweet as Personal Negative or Non-Negative, we aggregated the frequencies of profanity words, emoticons, and AFINN words into two metrics: Negative Score and Non-Negative Score. Subsequently we used a threshold to determine the label of the tweet. The Negative Score and Non-Negative Score are defined as follows.",

We compare the performance of Negative versus Non-Negative classification with previous labeling method and with the current labeling method. In this chapter, we call the previous method EPE, as it is an Existence-based method using Profanity list and Emoticons, and we called the current labeling method FPEA, as it is a Frequency-based method using Profanity, Emoticon, and AFINN. The classifier is trained by each of the three models, Multinomial Na\u00efve Bayes (MNB), Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The accuracies of Negative versus Non-Negative classification and confusion matrices of the best classifiers for human annotated datasets are shown in Tables 9 and 10 , respectively. Overall, the Frequency-based method with Profanity, Emoticon, and AFINN increases the accuracy of the best classifier by 7 % in the epidemic dataset, and by 2 % in the mental health dataset compared with the previous Existence-based method using Profanity list and Emoticons.

To derive the MOC from Twitter, we developed a two-step classification approach to analyze sentiments in disease-related tweets. We first distinguished Personal from News (Non-Personal) tweets. In the second stage, the sentiment analysis was applied only to Personal tweets to distinguish Negative from Non-Negative tweets. In order to evaluate the two-step classification method, we created a test dataset by human annotation for three domains: epidemic, clinical science, and mental health. The Fleiss's Kappa values between annotators were 0.40, 0.54, and 0.33, respectively. These moderate agreements illustrate the complexity of the sentiment classification task, since even humans exhibit relatively low agreement on the labels of tweets.",
