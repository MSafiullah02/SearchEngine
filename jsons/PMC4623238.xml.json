            "text": "H7N9 is a novel avian influenza virus A strain whose infection of poultry occurs worldwide, but infection of this subtype in humans in Asia has not been observed previously [1]. Surprisingly, this strain was found to be highly pathogenic to humans and infected three urban residents in Shanghai or Anhui, China, in March 2013. The virus spread mainly though the respiratory pathway via direct or intimate contact with excretions or secretions from infected birds [2\u20136]. Since then, the new H7N9 strain infections in humans have spread rapidly from eastern China to other provinces of China, leading to approximately 130 cases of infections that are highly pathogenic, rapidly progress to the lower respiratory tract, and have a high mortality rate [2\u20136]. Infection by the H7N9 strain causes highly distributed lesions in the infected lung. Due to immune deficiency during the early-to-mid course of the disease, the alveoli of the infected lung excrete exudate accompanied by lung consolidation and/or pleural effusion [7]. Finally, most of the patients develop and some die of severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [8, 9]. Thus, it is extraordinarily important to evaluate accurately the pathological lung entities and pulmonary aeration in these patients.",

Chest CT is important for ARDS diagnosis but is expensive, exposes patients to radiation, and might cause patients to be at risk of infection during transportation [10\u201314]. Besides, chest radiography cannot be used to monitor the lung repeatedly in real time. Therefore, the routine use of bedside lung ultrasonography for critically ill patients with ARDS is especially important to monitor the chest changes in a timely manner for the diagnosis or treatment of the complications caused by infection of the H7N9 strain [4].",

The scoring was performed according to the criteria described previously [15]. Normal ventilation (N, score of 1), A line; mild reduction of pulmonary ventilation, B1 (score of 2); severe reduction of pulmonary ventilation, B2 (score of 3); consolidation of lung signs (score of 5). The scoring was reproducible without major discrepancies, and ultrasonography (USG) assessment was repeated at least three times.

The characteristics of ARDS in the patients infected with H7N9 were similar to previous investigations [19\u201321]; however, how to dynamically monitor the lung morphology and intrathoracic airways in patients in real-time and adjust the treatment plan for a definitive diagnosis has not been explored previously. We applied bedside lung ultrasonography to evaluate the lung injury by examining the pulmonary exudation and consolidation regions. We found that the lung ultrasonogram score was positively correlated with the severity of lung injury after H7N9 infection and that patients with severe ARDS had a greater score than other patients with multiple comet-tail signs, including the area from the posterior back to the anterior chest. Thus, the effective ventilation area reduced sharply, resulting in acute severe hypoxemia or even death. Therefore, we demonstrated that bedside lung ultrasonography can be used to observe the pulmonary morphological changes in patients infected with the H7N9 virus. In addition, the lung sonogram score and oxygenation index were negatively correlated, indicating that the sonogram score and oxygenation index similarly evaluated the patient\u2019s condition during early ARDS. Although the statistical analyses had certain limitations due to the low number of cases and the short period of treatment, it was clearly shown that the mortality rate increased if the lung sonogram score continuously exceeded 30 in 1 week, which was closely related to exudation during early ARDS.",

Pleural effusion usually emerges during the course of early-to-mid disease in accordance with the ARDS caused by H7N9 infection [22, 23]. The effusion volume might increase quickly in a short period. To maintain satisfactory oxygenation, a high PEEP value during ventilation was generally used, which possibly led to tension pneumothorax, especially when lung consolidation and pulmonary fibrosis developed. Once plural effusion or pneumothorax happened, the effective ventilation area decreased dramatically so that the hypoxemia was aggravated with a fatality [24, 25]. Therefore, bedside lung ultrasonography could help us to discover pulmonary morphological changes in a timely manner and guide the puncture accurately, leading to a favorable prognosis.",
