The hospital is providing tertiary medical care for an estimated population of two million. The hospital became a comprehensive stroke unit in February 2019. The stroke unit operated by a multidisciplinary team from different neurosciences background. Due to the global coronavirus (COVID-19) disease pandemic and to lessen potential infectious hazards to the medical teams, stroke physicians, neuro-interventional team and other patients, a group of vascular neurology, neurosurgery, emergency room physicians, anesthesia, neuro-interventional physicians, along with local healthcare taskforce were gathered to develop a modified protected stroke code for stroke patients with large vessel occlusion. All members were board-certified in their specialties. The encounters were conducted through teleconferencing platforms. Each group of the team was asked to develop a modified algorithm to the pre-existing local stroke mechanical thrombectomy code acknowledging the new COVID-19 disease pandemic. The Protected Stroke Mechanical Thrombectomy (PSMT) code aims to facilitate the timely necessitated acute stroke intervention and protecting the healthcare providers. The modified protocol was agreed upon by each group based on the best medical shared knowledge, clinical practice, available literature review, and the final consensus among the team. The final approval to launch the protected stroke mechanical thrombectomy code was obtained from the local healthcare taskforce.",

Strokes with LVO remain a top neurological emergency even during a medical crisis because of the high mortality rate and severe neurological disability. The global pandemic crisis of the highly contagious COVID-19 outlines a unique challenge to any medical organization. Since the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients is globally increasing, neurologists, and especially neuro-interventionalists who attend the stroke codes, should pay attention to the safety protocols. Here we present our local experience in dealing with acute stroke patients with LVO who need urgent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) during the pandemic of COVID-19. We are a new comprehensive stroke center established by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in February 2019, with a total of 50 cases of mechanical thrombectomies till the end of March 2020. Also, our hospital is the only ready COVID-19 center in Aseer region (southwestern part of Saudi Arabia). This paper will focus only on acute stroke patients who need urgent mechanical thrombectomy. We established a protected stroke mechanical thrombectomy (PSMT) code ( Table 1) Furthermore, due to the exceptionally increasing number of COVID-19 patients, and unlikely to have COVID-19 test status before the mechanical thrombectomy, we assumed that every stroke patient with LVO who presented to our stroke center is having COVID-19 until proven otherwise. Our hospital is applying a strict COVID-19 visual and clinical screening to all visitors and patients. However, we use extra safety measures, particularly toward stroke patients with LVO due to the inherited complex clinical presentation, which includes but not limited to the decreased level of consciousness, aphagia, and sometimes difficulties in obtaining collateral needed clinical information.",

In such scenarios, we use recommended standard personal protective equipment (PPE) precautions (eye protection, face shield, surgical gown, gloves, shoe covers, and a fit-tested N95 mask) before approaching any stroke patients [5, 6] . To protect healthcare workers, these precautions are applied to any staff members directly dealing with stroke patients (neurologists, neuro-interventionalists, emergency room staff, angiography suite nurses, and technicians). We perform focused neurological examination and try to limit the neurological examinations that may compromise the contact or airborne precautions such as repetitive language assessment or cerebellum examination [7-9].
