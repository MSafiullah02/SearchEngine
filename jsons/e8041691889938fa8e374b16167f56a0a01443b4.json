While existing supply chains are struggling to meet the surge in demand, the limited supply of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has placed healthcare workers at risk. This paper presents a method for scalable and distributed manufacturing of FFR filter material based on a combination of centrifugal melt spinning utilizing readily available cotton candy machines as an example. The proposed method produces nonwoven polypropylene fabric material with filtering efficiency of up to 96% for particles 0.30-0.49 \u00b5m in diameter. We additionally demonstrate a scalable means to test for filtration efficiency and pressure drop to ensure a standardized degree of quality in the output material. We perform preliminary optimization of relevant parameters for scale-up and propose that this is a viable method to rapidly produce up to one million N95 FFRs per day in distributed manner with just six machines per site operating across 200 locations. We share this work as a starting point for others to rapidly construct, replicate and develop their own affordable modular processes aimed at producing high quality filtration material to address the current FFR shortage globally.",

The unprecedented demand for N95 FFRs has rapidly depleted existing supply chains, causing medical centers in major cities to initiate efforts to decontaminate N95 FFRs for reuse. Resource limited regions that normally have very limited access to N95 FFRs have limited choice but to utilize ineffective substitutes such as T-shirts and tissues, which places their already-limited number of healthcare workers at great risk of infection. While existing N95 supply chains have struggled to meet the surge in demand, bad actors have begun flooding the market with counterfeit FFRs that are incapable of providing appropriate respiratory protection 1 . For these reasons, there is an urgent need to augment the existing supply chain of valid N95 FFRs through distributed, rapidly accessible manufacturing methods combined with quality control and local testing and validation techniques.",

Electrostatic charge contributes as much as 95% of the filtration efficiency 8 and is typically accomplished using corona charging 9 . However, expanding production to new industrial meltblowing facilities is a major effort that includes precision manufacturing of large-scale, specialized extrusion dies as well as design of an extensive fabrication workflow, requiring months of construction before operation is possible 10 .

The physical footprint of CMS operation is significantly reduced compared to that of industrial meltblowing operations, allowing multiple CMS production lines to be run in parallel at smaller, local settings.

Commercial cotton candy machines, normally used for centrifugal spinning of sugar-based fibers, are a convenient apparatus for producing sufficiently high temperatures, although many designs do not have sufficiently fast rotational speeds. Larger industrial-grade machines, such as the one used in this report, achieve higher rotational speeds, enabling production of fibers suitable for use as a filtration material ( Figure 1 ). The material studied in this report was produced using a cotton candy machine modified only by replacing the standard aluminum mesh with a solid aluminum ring. The ring has several small apertures (600 \u00b5m) along its perimeter, thereby allowing more effective distribution of heat and better control over fiber morphology.",

Amorphous polypropylene produced dense material that displayed high cohesiveness and adhesiveness, meaning it was not compatible for application as FFR material.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to compare a commercially available N95 filtration material with CMS-produced and compacted high molecular weight material ( Figure 3) . The images indicate that the compaction results in the formation of a well-packed fiber matrix, suitable for further testing. Filtration media rated for N95-grade performance requires removal of at least 95% of particles of average diameter 0.3 \u00b5m. To verify the applicability of our CMS material in the context of FFRs, we performed filtration testing using a custom-built setup involving a handheld particle counter and a capsule constructed from threaded PVC piping to hold circular samples excised from bulk, compacted CMS material. Using incense smoke as a source of particles primarily in the 0.3 \u00b5m diameter range, we found that material produced by our CMS process enabled filtration efficiencies that exceeded 95% on average for three independently compacted samples. We found that N95-grade performance was achieved regardless of the molecular weight of polypropylene used (Figure 4 , right). Samples excised from commercial N95 FFR material yielded an average filtration efficiency exceeding 97%, as expected. By contrast, samples excised from T-shirt fabric material (suggested for homemade masks by the CDC) gave a filtration efficiency of 45%, similar to previous reports 14 . Airflow pressure drop across our CMS material samples was found to significantly greater than that of commercial N95 FFR samples (20 vs. 3.2 kPa) (Figures 4, left,  and 9 ). This suggests that high filtration efficiency in the case of CMS material was achieved at the expense of breathability relative to commercially manufactured filtration material. The significantly higher grammage of compacted CMS samples relative to N95 FFR material likely gives rise to this reduced breathability and could be addressed by reducing the mass of material used for compaction. Moreover, given that increased electrostatic charging of non-woven fibrous material enables higher filtration efficiency for a given material density 8 , introducing electrostatic charging could improve breathability of our CMS material while maintaining high filtration efficiency.",

We first attempted to introduce electrostatic charge on filtration material after production by CMS using corona charging 17, 18 , coupling to a van de Graaff generator, as well as triboelectric charge transfer using polystyrene material. A surface voltmeter was used to measure the voltage close to the insulator surfaces. Surface charge density on the fibers was then estimated based on the measured voltage readings (details in the methods section). Charge density on a commercial N95 FFR material was estimated to be around -2000 nC m \u22122 . Compacted filtration material produced using high MW polypropylene have exhibited charge densities close to -1000 nC m \u22122 . After charging using the above three methods, estimated surface charge densities on the CMS-produced fibers have been calculated to . Filtration efficiency and pressure drop testing of filtration material produced using CMS. Particle filtration efficiency of filtration materials were tested using incense smoke as a source of particles and a handheld particle counter (Lighthouse 3016). Circular samples of commercial N95 FFR (Kimberly-Clark), compacted CMS material produced from polypropylene feedstock of two different molecular weights, and T-shirt fabric were excised and characterized in a custom-built filtration testing apparatus. Filtration efficiency was calculated as the ratio of detected particles (0.30-0.49 \u00b5m) with and without filter. T-shirt fabric material consisted of 50% cotton, 25% polyester, and 25% rayon. Pressure drop testing was performed at a constant flow rate of 4.00 L min \u22121 using an in-line pressure sensor (Honeywell) and the same excised material samples. Breathability is reported as the inverse of pressure drop across material and is taken relative to that measured for commercial N95 FFR material. be as high as -9500 nC m \u22122 . However, our surface charge measurement method does not accurately reveal the homogeneity or stability of the transferred charges, and therefore careful interpretation of the measured charge density values is advised. Further measurements which can help analyze the uniformity of charges are necessary to inform how to use electrostatic charging for improved filtration efficiency. We also attempted charging of fibers during the production process (e-CMS) by applying an external electric field between the heated CCM spinneret (containing molten polypropylene) and collection drum. Charging of fibers would occur by trapping induced dipoles in the fibers in the aligned state after solidification 17 . Preliminary results indicated that this method of charging did not noticeably influence fiber morphology or improve filtration efficiency (Figures 7 and 8) . Parallel efforts by another group using a CMS process have similarly shown that kilovolt-strength electric potentials are not necessary (OIST) 19 . Further development of the CMS process to accommodate and better understand potentially beneficial effects of charging during fiber production remains important.",

The motivation for this is twofold. First, a purpose built device will offer greater control over experimental parameters. For example, a simple spindle rotor offers greater control over and access to higher rotational speeds. This has the potential to reduce fiber diameter, offering improvements in filtration performance, and increasing throughput. Additionally, a modular device design will allow for much more flexibility in testing different approaches for charging the material during production. This is especially valuable since it allows for community based development, where improvements to the process can be made in a distributed way. Second, the use of readily available components can reduce cost by up to 50%. The current unit cost of our prototype is \u223c $1, 000. This cost is based on a standard cotton candy machine ($650), a custom machined cylinder ($50), and a van de Graaff Generator ($300). A 50% reduction in unit cost increases the economic scalability of this approach.",

During our prototyping phase, we iterated over several unique CMS designs and have been able to consistently produce at least 1-2 g/min of material across a range of processing parameters. Given that a typical N95 FFR contains \u223c 2g of filtration material, we can gain some perspective on the extent to which the present proposal can make a meaningful impact. A single CMS can produce enough filtration material for 1000 FFRs in a day. Therefore, a small scale facility consisting of 6 CMS devices operated for 12 hours by a small group of people to produce enough material for 5000 FFRs per day. This is sufficient to supply the daily demand of a large medical facility 20 . Alternatively, 1000 CMS devices operating as a distributed network provides a rapidly configurable and resilient manufacturing capacity equivalent to a single, industrial-scale facility. We believe that the approach described here has the potential to make a significant contribution towards addressing the current FFR shortage.

Circular samples of commercial N95 FFR (Kimberly-Clark), compacted CMS material produced from polypropylene feedstock of two different molecular weights, and T-shirt fabric were excised and characterized in a custom-built filtration testing apparatus. Filtration efficiency was calculated as the ratio of detected particles (0.30-0.49 \u00b5m) with and without filter. T-shirt fabric material consisted of 50% cotton, 25% polyester, and 25% rayon. Pressure drop testing was performed at a constant flow rate of 4.00 L min \u22121 using an in-line pressure sensor (Honeywell) and the same excised material samples.
