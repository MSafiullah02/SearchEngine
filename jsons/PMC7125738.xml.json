Lower yields of 6ChPurdRib productivity were obtained when equimolar quantities of substrates were used. Productivity was 0.63 mM/h when 2:6 mM ratio (6ChPur/dUrd) was evaluated. However, when an excess of 6-halogenated base was tested (6:2 mM ratio), 6ChPurdRib productivity was increased significantly (0.9 mM/h).
