Earlier, morphological traits were used for assessing similarities between species and building phylogenetic trees. Presently, phylogenetics relies on information extracted from genetic material such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) or protein sequences [2]. Methods used for phylogenetic inference have changed drastically during the past two decades: from alignment-based to alignment-free methods [3]. This paper has reviewed various methods under phylogenetic tree construction from character to distance methods and alignment-based to alignment-free methods. A brief review of phylogenetic tree applications is also given in cancer studies.",

            "text": "A phylogenetic tree can be unrooted or rooted, implying directions corresponding to evolutionary time, i.e. the species at the leaves of a tree relate to the current day species. The species can be expressed as DNA strings which are formed by combining four nucleotides A, T, C and G (A\u2014adenine, T\u2014thymine, C\u2014cytosine and G\u2014guanine). In literature, various string processing algorithms are reported which can quickly analyse these DNA and RNA sequences and build a phylogeny of sequences or species based on their similarity and dissimilarity. A high similarity among two sequences usually implies significant functional or structural likeliness, and these sequences are closely related in the phylogenetic tree. To get more precise information about the extent of similarity to some other sequence stored in a database, we must be able to compare sequences quickly with a set of sequences. For this, we need to perform the multiple sequence comparison. Dynamic programming concepts facilitate this comparison using alignment methods, but it involves more computation. Moreover, the iterative computational steps limit its utility for long length sequences [3]. Alignment-free methods overcome this limitation as they follow alternative metrics like word frequency or sequence entropy for finding similarity between sequences.",

These methods use probability and consider variation in a set of sequences [10]. Both approaches consider the tree with the best score tree, which requires the smallest number of changes to perform alignment. Maximum parsimony method suffers badly from the long-branch attraction and gives the least information about the branch lengths [10]. In such cases, if two external branches are separated by short internal branches, it leads to the incorrect tree. Some of the salient features of character-based methods are mentioned in Table 1.\n",

In the k-tuple method, a genetic sequence is represented by a frequency vector of fixed length subsequence and the similarity or dissimilarity measures are found based on the frequency vector of subsequence. The probabilistic methods represent the sequences using the transition matrix of a Markov chain [12] of a pre-specified order, and comparison of two sequences is done by finding the distance between two transition matrices. Graphical representation comprising 2D or 3D or even 20D methods provides an easy way to view, sort and compare various sequences.

Application of the phylogenetic tree can be explored for finding similarities among breast cancer subtypes based on gene data [14, 15]. Discovery of genes associated in cancer subtype help researchers to map different pathways to classify cancer subtypes according to their mutations. Methods of phylogenetic tree inference have proliferated in cancer genome studies such as breast cancer [13].
