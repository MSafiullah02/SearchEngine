Using turkey embryo to isolate virus directly from beetle gut or whole beetle provided a more direct diagnosis of the presence of TCV by reducing competitive organisms that may interfere or confound the results. Previous studies indicate that TCV was detectable by direct immunofluorescence (FA) by day 3 after inoculation (Guy et al. 1997). Inoculated embryos were dissected and the intestines examined for presence of TCV. Immunofluorescence detected the presence of virus in embryonic tissues inoculated with beetles euthanized 1 h after feeding on NC95 infected feces. No virus was found in beetle inoculated embryonic tissues for time intervals 12 and 24 h (Table 2). No virus was found in the negative control groups.",

The agent may be transported on the cuticle or exoskeleton of the insect, or may be ingested by the insect to be retained in a viable state as it passes through the insect gut. In this study we found that surface sterilization of the insect effectively eliminated TCV from the exoskeleton of the insect. Turkey poults infected with embryo-propagated TCV (NC95) and TCV from PEMS affected turkeys had reduced weight gains when compared with the control groups. Turkeys administered surface sterilized virus infected beetles did not suffer a reduction in weight gains, nor did they test positive by either the FA or serology. Although birds inoculated with unsterilized beetle homogenates in NC95 group did not experience a reduction in weight, one of six birds had converted serologically. Experimental studies with isolate NC95 demonstrated that the virus did not produce clinically apparent disease (Guy et al. 1999). In our study viable virus (NC95) was either not present or perhaps below detectable levels in the beetle gut 24 h after feeding on infected feces, suggesting that the beetle gut was environmentally inhospitable for the virus. Further examination of the viability of NC95 indicated the virus remained active in beetle guts and on whole beetles (unsterilized) for 1 h but was no longer viable after 12 h. The implications of these results are evident. A. diaperinus may well be involved in the transmission of TCV within a turkey house in which an active outbreak has occurred where beetles and birds are in close contact. However, it is less likely to transmit disease upon immigrating from field soils to a turkey house after the land application of litter.",

Turkey poults infected with TCV+ feces from PEMS affected turkeys had reduced weight gains when compared with the control group. Turkeys administered unsterilized beetles in the TCV+PEMS group had reduced weight gains similar to that of the positive control group and tested positive in the FA test and serologically. Therefore, the agent(s) contributing to PEMS appear to be viable on the surface of A. diaperinus for at least 24 h. Although, the results of our second experiment indicated TCV was fastidious, some virus particles in the PEMS + inoculum must have remained viable and gained purchase to be serologically detectable. The insect exoskeleton or perhaps fecal material adhering to the exoskeleton may have provided sufficient harborage to protect the agent(s). Although the etiology of PEMS remains unsettled this study further supports the theory that PEMS may involve a complex of organisms. Conclusive evidence of the role of A. diaperinus and other insects in the transmission of PEMS depends on the more complete characterization of the etiologic agent.",
