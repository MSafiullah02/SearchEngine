Transmission heterogeneity describes a state in which most transmissions are related to a few patients and most patients do not transmit the disease.

The course of an epidemic is influenced by the basic reproduction number (R 0 = the average number of cases that 1 case produces in a susceptible population) and transmission heterogeneity [3] . As R 0 represents an average quantity, it is often insufficient to explain individual variation, and as transmission heterogeneity reflects individual variation, it can help predict the likelihood of super-spreading events.

These spreaders had higher host infectivity and wider and prolonged contacts compared to nonspreaders. The risk factors for super-spreading events included a larger number of contacts and a pre-isolation ER visit. Doctor shopping was marginally associated with a super-spreading event. However, both spreaders with 5 or more transmissions and spreaders with 4 or fewer transmissions exhibited similar levels of host infectivity. It appears that both host infectivity and the number of contacts influenced MERS-CoV transmission, whereas super-spreading events were mostly associated with a greater likelihood of encountering other people under diverse environmental conditions. During the 2015 outbreak, approximately 75% of the transmissions occurred during days 4-7 after symptom onset, and this may be a period when the risk of transmission is particularly high. Furthermore, this high-risk period was temporally associated with other epidemiological factors. First, the period overlapped with the confirmed cases' visits to healthcare facilities, as hospitalization and ER visits peaked during days 4-7 after symptom onset. It is well known that MERS-CoV outbreaks generally occur in the healthcare setting [1, 5, 13, 20] , and the high-risk period may be associated with healthcare-seeking behaviors. Second, the high-risk period was several days (1-4 days) after the radiographic diagnoses of pneumonia, which generally occurred on days 3-4 after symptom onset. Although the significance of pre-isolation pneumonia has not been discussed previously, a radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia may influence transmission in 2 ways. First, it may directly increase the chance of transmission by actively generating lower respiratory tract secretions and a productive cough. Second, it may be an indirect index of disease severity and hospital visiting status.

Similar results were observed in a study of the SARS outbreak, which revealed that late admission to healthcare facilities (especially >4 days after symptom onset) was associated with super-spreading events [21] . Thus, infection prevention measures should target isolation before this critical period (ie, within 4-7 days after symptom onset and within 1 day after the detection of pneumonia).

First, some of the confirmed cases had multiple potential sources of infection, and we attributed the transmission to the case with the highest epidemiological probability. The source of infection was clear in >95% of the transmissions, and we excluded 3 cases that had contact with multiple cases and an unclear source of transmission.

Second, we did not have access to genomic sequencing data, which might have provided information regarding the relatedness of transmitted strains.
