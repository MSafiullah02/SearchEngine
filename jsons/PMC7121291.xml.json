Reliance on creatinine and urine output to identify AKI (using, e.g., the pediatric RIFLE score [7]) may in the future be improved using alternative biomarkers, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) [2, 8]. Management is directed at improving renal perfusion and oxygenation. Volume replacement with crystalloid or colloid should be undertaken to optimize preload. Central venous pressure or pulmonary wedge pressure monitoring is essential to guide volume replacement in children in severe shock. The use of low-dose (2\u20135 pg/kg/min) dopamine to reduce renal vasoconstriction together with administration of inotropic agents such as dobutamine or epinephrine to improve cardiac output may reverse prerenal failure. Early elective ventilation should be undertaken in patients with severe shock. If oliguria persists despite volume replacement and inotropic therapy, dialysis or hemofiltration should be instituted early, because septic and catabolic patients may rapidly develop hyperkalemia and severe electrolyte imbalance.",

In developed countries, most cases are caused by group B and Y strains, particularly after introduction of meningococcal C vaccination, whereas epidemics of meningococcal groups A, C, and W135 continue to occur in many underdeveloped regions of the world [9]. In 2013, a meningococcal B vaccine was approved for use in Europe, Canada, and Australia, and it has been used in the United States to help control outbreaks (see www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine). Peak incidence is in infants for group B disease and teenagers and young adults for groups C. However, the disease can occur at any age. There are two major presentations of meningococcal disease: meningococcal meningitis presents with features indistinguishable from those of other forms of meningitis, including headache, stiff neck, and photophobia. Lumbar puncture is required to identify the causative agent and distinguish this from other forms of meningitis. Despite the acute nature of the illness, the prognosis is good, and most patients with the purely meningitic form of the illness recover without sequelae. The most common sequelae is hearing loss and so all children should have a hearing test after discharge [10].",

Mortality is directly related to both the plasma endotoxin concentration and the intensity of the inflammatory response, as indicated by levels of TNF and other inflammatory markers. Patients with meningococcemia have a profound capillary leak leading to severe hypovolemia. A loss of plasma proteins from the intravascular space is probably the major cause of shock, but myocardial suppression secondary to IL6 production is also important [14]. Intense vasoconstriction further impairs tissue and organ perfusion, and vasculitis with intravascular thrombosis and consumption of platelets and coagulation factors is also present.",

This is prerenal in origin and may respond to volume replacement and inotropic support. If cardiac output cannot be improved and renal underperfusion persists, established renal failure supervenes. Occasionally, cortical necrosis or infarction of the kidneys occurs. Children with meningococcemia should be aggressively managed in a pediatric intensive care unit, with early administration of antibiotics (penicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin), volume replacement, hemodynamic monitoring, and the use of inotropic agents and vasodilators. If oliguria persists despite measures to improve cardiac output, elective ventilation and dialysis should be instituted early. Because activation of coagulation pathways occurs, severe acquired protein C deficiency may result and is usually associated with substantial mortality [15]. Protein C is a natural anticoagulant which also has an important anti-inflammatory activity. Despite evidence for impaired function of the activated protein C pathway in meningococcal diseases [15] and adult trials suggesting benefit of activated protein C administration in septic shock (PROWESS trial) [16], pediatric trials of activated protein C showed no clear benefit and were associated with increased risk of intracranial bleeding in very young infants [6]. The role of aPC therapy in pediatric sepsis remains unclear. Most patients who survive the initial 24\u201348 h of the illness and regain hemodynamic stability will ultimately recover renal function even if dialysis is required for several weeks.",

In recent years, there have been increasing reports of severe staphylococcal disease, associated with shock and multiorgan failure, caused by strains of staphylococci producing the PVL toxin. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a phage-encoded toxin, which profoundly impairs the host response due to its toxic effect on leukocytes (see review [24]). PVL-producing strains are associated with tissue necrosis and increased propensity to cause abscesses in lung, bone, joint, and soft tissue infections. Perinephric abscesses have been reported [25]. There are increasing numbers of children and adults admitted with fulminant sepsis and shock due to PVL-producing strains, and renal failure is a significant component of the multiorgan failure. In addition to intensive care support, antibiotic treatment of PVL strains should include antibiotics which reduce toxin production, such as clindamycin, linezolid or rifampicin, as well as vancomycin if the strain is resistant to methicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics should be avoided, as there is some data to suggest that PVL toxin production can be increased by these antibiotics under some conditions [23, 26]. Immunoglobulin infusion may also be of benefit. PVL sepsis is often associated with thrombosis, and prophylactic heparin should be commenced in seriously ill patients. Aggressive surgical drainage of all collections requires close consultation with orthopedic and surgical teams.",

It accounts for 5\u201315 % of all HUS cases in children and typically develops 3\u201313 days after streptococcal infection. The incidence following streptococcal infection is 0.4\u20130.6 %. Since the introduction of the 7- and 13-valent vaccines, there have been reports of HUS cases caused by strain not covered in the vaccine [46]. In 1955, Gasser and colleagues described HUS as a clinical entity in children, and they included two infants with pneumonia among the five patients they described [47]. HUS associated with pneumococcal infection differs in pathophysiology from that caused by the commoner Vero toxin-producing E. coli. S. pneumoniae (as well as influenza and Clostridia species) produce the enzyme neuraminidase which cleaves sialic acid from the surfaces of exposed cells [48]. Neuraminidase causes desialation of red blood cells, and possibly other blood cells and endothelium, by the removal of terminal neuraminic acid, which leads to unmasking of the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T antigen) which is present on the surface of red blood cells, platelets, and glomerular capillary endothelia. Normal serum contains antibodies to this antigen which cause a widespread agglutination of blood cells and platelets when the antigen is exposed, resulting in intravascular obstruction, hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. The direct Coombs test is positive in 90 % of cases of streptococcal HUS [49], either from bound anti-T IgM or from anti-T antibodies. The diagnosis of Thomsen-Friedenreich antibody-induced HUS should be suspected in patients with AKI, thrombocytopenia, and hemolysis after an episode of pneumonia or bacteremia caused by S. pneumoniae. Fragmented red blood cells will usually be present on blood film.",

Diagnosis can be confirmed by isolation of the spirochetes from blood or CSF in the first 10 days of the illness or from urine in the second week [58]. The organism may be seen in biopsy specimens of the kidney or skin or in the CSF by dark-field microscopy or silver staining. Serologic tests to detect leptospirosis are now sensitive and considerably aid the diagnosis. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody may be detected as early as 6\u201310 days into the illness, and antibody titers rise progressively over the next 2\u20134 weeks. Some patients remain seronegative, and negative serologic test results do not completely exclude the diagnosis. In one series, levels of IgM and IgG anticardiolipin concentrations were significantly increased in leptospirosis patients with AKI [57]. Leptospirosis is treated with intravenous penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics. The severity of leptospirosis is reduced by antibiotic treatment, even if started late in the course of the illness [55].

A major breakthrough in the search for the cause of HUS occurred in the 1980s when Karmali et al. reported that 11 of 15 children with diarrhea-associated HUS had evidence of infection with a strain of E. coli that produced a toxin active on Vero cells [63]. In diarrhea-associated HUS in the United States and most of Europe, E. coli 0157:H7 is the most important of these strains. E. coli 0157:H7 occurs naturally in the GI tract of cattle and other animals, and humans become infected through contaminated food products. Most outbreaks have been associated with consumption of undercooked meat, but unpasteurized milk and cider, drinking water, and poorly chlorinated water for recreational use have also been implicated as vehicles for bacterial spread.

Children under 10 years, those with a compromised immune system and those with a delayed diagnosis are at an increased risk of fatality. Prior to specific antibiotic therapy, the mortality was 25 % (http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/). The onset occurs 2\u20138 days after the bite of an infected tick, and the majority of cases occur during the summer months. High fever develops initially, followed by the pathognomonic rash, which occurs between the second and sixth days of the illness. The rash initially consists of small erythematous macules, but later these become maculopapular and petechial, and in untreated patients, confluent hemorrhagic areas may be seen. The rash first appears at the periphery and spreads up the trunk. Involvement of the palms and soles is a characteristic feature. Headache, restlessness, meningism, and confusion may occur together with other neurologic signs. Cardiac involvement with congestive heart failure and arrhythmia are common. Pulmonary involvement occurs in 10\u201340 % of cases. Infection is associated with an initial leukopenia, followed by neutrophil leukocytosis. Thrombocytopenia occurs in most cases [74].",

The incidence of shunt nephritis has decreased due to the preference of ventriculoperitoneal shunts over ventriculoatrial shunts; however, shunt nephritis has been reported with the former [85]. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the causative organisms in 75 % of cases. It is an immune-complex disease with chronic hyperantigenemia, hyperglobulinemia, and the deposition of immunoglobulins, complement, and immune complexes on the glomerular basement membrane [86]. The clinical and pathologic findings are similar to those in SBE. Presenting features are proteinuria, hematuria, and pyuria, and they may progress to renal failure. Immune complexes containing the bacterial antigens and complement are present in the serum, and C3 is depressed. Histologic findings are those of a diffuse mesangiocapillary GN. The prognosis for the renal lesion is good if the infection is treated early. This usually involves removal of the infected shunt or replacement of a VA with a VP shunt and administration of appropriate antibiotics, though possible progression to end-stage renal disease requires frequent renal monitoring of patients with ventriculoatrial shunts [87]. Certain case reports have also seen benefit with the use of steroids as adjunctive therapy [88].",

After a prodromal illness, frank vasculitis affecting virtually any organ appears. Abdominal pain, fever, mononeuritis multiplex, and pulmonary and renal involvement may occur and can be the first clinical presentation of hepatitis B [94]. The renal involvement may appear as hypertension, hematuria, proteinuria, or renal failure. Laboratory investigations reveal a florid acute-phase response, leukocytosis, and anemia. Transaminase levels are usually elevated, and HBsAg is present in the circulation. The pathology consists of focal inflammation of small- and medium-sized arteries, with fibrinoid necrosis, leukocyte infiltration, and fibrin deposition. Renal pathology may be limited to the medium-sized arteries or may coexist with GN [95]. Circulating immune complexes containing HBsAg and anti-HBs antibodies are usually present in the circulation. C3, C4, and total hemolytic complement levels are depressed. A positive ANCA excludes HBV PAN [93]. Although most evidence suggests that the pathogenesis involves an immune-complex-mediated vasculitis, autoantibody- or cell-mediated vascular injury may coexist. If the condition is untreated, the mortality is high. Most studies suggest that steroids or immunosuppressants help to suppress the vasculitis but potentially predispose to chronic infection or progressive liver disease. Successful treatment of hepatitis B-associated PAN with nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine or newer antiviral drugs, either alone or in combination with interferon-alpha and conventional immunosuppressive therapy, has been reported [93, 96].",

HBV MGN usually presents in children aged 2\u201312. There is a striking male predominance. The virus is usually acquired by vertical transmission from infected mothers or horizontally from infected family members. Unlike adults with HBV MGN, children do not usually have a history of hepatitis or of active liver disease, but liver function test results are generally mildly abnormal. Liver biopsy specimens may show minimal abnormalities, chronic persistent hepatitis, or (occasionally) more severe changes.",

Immunohistologic study reveals deposits of IgG and C3 and (less commonly) IgM and IgA in subepithelial, subendothelial, or mesangial tissue.

            "text": "Immunologic deposition of HBV and antibody in the glomerular capillary wall is clearly involved in the glomerular injury, but the underlying immunologic events are incompletely understood [90]. Passive trapping of circulating immune complexes may be involved, but the circulating immune complexes containing HBsAg are usually larger than would be expected to penetrate the basement membrane. HBsAg and HBcAg are anionic and are therefore unlikely to penetrate the glomerular capillary wall. In contrast, HBeAg forms smaller complexes with anti-HBe antibodies and may readily penetrate the GBM. This may explain the observation that HBeAg in the circulation frequently correlates with the severity of the disease [90]. An alternative mechanism for immune-mediated glomerular injury is the trapping of HBV antigens by antibody previously deposited in the kidney. Anti-HBe antibodies are cationic and may readily localize in the glomerulus and subsequently bind circulating antigen and complement. The third possibility is that the depositions of HBV and antibodies are consequences of glomerular injury by cellular mechanisms or autoantibodies. Little evidence supports this view at present [90]. A transgenic mouse model of HBV-associated nephropathy has been developed, in which HBsAg and HBcAg is expressed in the liver and kidney, particularly tubular epithelial cells, without viral replication. In these mice, gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of acute-phase proteins, particularly C3, although measurable serum C3 levels were reduced. This supports the notion that local persistent expression of HBV viral proteins contributes to HBV-associated nephropathy [97].",

Experience with pediatric kidney transplant recipients suggests a 67 % incidence of CMV infection, with approximately 67 % being negative at the time of transplantation [115]. The direct and indirect effects of CMV infection result in a significant morbidity and mortality among kidney transplant recipients. CMV-negative patients who receive a CMV-positive allograft are at risk for primary infection and graft dysfunction. Patients who are CMV seropositive at the time of transplantation are also at risk of reactivation and superinfection. Tubulointerstitial nephritis is a well-characterized pathologic feature of renal allograft CMV disease, which can be difficult to distinguish from injury caused by rejection. Histologic evidence of endothelial cell injury and mononuclear cell infiltration in the glomeruli has been reported. CMV glomerular vasculopathy in the absence of tubulointerstitial disease, causing renal allograft dysfunction, has also been reported [116]. Beyond the acute allograft nephropathy associated with CMV viremia, CMV is known to cause chronic vascular injury. This may adversely affect the long-term outcome of the allograft and may be the explanation for the observed association with chronic allograft nephropathy.",

Immune histocytochemistry is used for diagnosing end-organ disease. Quantitative plasma PCR testing (PCR viral load) is increasingly used for diagnosis and monitoring of CMV viremia in renal transplant recipients [117].

Major limitations of ganciclovir therapy are the induction of renal tubular dysfunction and bone marrow toxicity, principally neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Dosage adjustments are necessary for recipients with renal dysfunction. Oral valganciclovir is recommended for CMV prophylaxis posttransplant [118]. Duration of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on the serostatus of the donor and recipient [115]. While it is effective in reducing the incidence of symptomatic CMV, prospective viral surveillance studies have shown subclinical infection in 12\u201322 % of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, hence the importance of viral surveillance [115]. Use of other antiviral agents such as foscarnet and cidofovir is limited because of nephrotoxicity and difficulty of administration. The role of high-titer CMV immunoglobulin therapy in reducing severe CMV-associated disease after stem cell transplant remains unclear [119].",

Varicella, however, is rarely associated with renal complications. In fatal cases with disseminated varicella and in the immunocompromised individual, renal involvement is more common. Histologic findings in fatal cases include congested hemorrhagic glomeruli, endothelial cell hyperplasia, and tubular necrosis. In mild and nonfatal cases and in nonimmunocompromised individuals, varicella is occasionally associated with a variety of renal manifestations, ranging from mild nephritis to nephrotic syndrome and AKI [120]. Histologic findings include endocapillary cell proliferation, epithelial and endothelial cell hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Rapidly progressive nephritis has also been reported. Immunohistochemical studies reveal glomerular deposition of IgG, IgM, IgA, and C3. On electron microscopy, granular electron-dense deposits have been found in the paramesangial region, and varicella antigens may be deposited in the glomeruli. The features suggest an immune-complex nephritis. Elevated circulating levels of IgG and IgA immune complexes and depressed C3 and C4 levels support this possibility [121].",

It is usually caused by interstitial nephritis that is likely the result of immunopathologic injury precipitated by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. However, the identification of EBV DNA in the kidney raises the possibility that direct infection might play a role [122, 123].

There is microcystic distortion of tubule segments, which contributes to increasing kidney size. Podocyte hyperplasia can become so marked that it causes obliteration of much of the urinary space, forming \u201cpseudocrescents\u201d [136]. Capillary walls are wrinkled and collapsed with obliteration of the capillary lumina. The interstitium is edematous with a variable degree of T-cell infiltration.

HIV is thought to infect renal tubuloepithelial cells through direct cell-cell transmission which then act as a separate viral compartment and facilitates replication distant from the blood. HIVAN 1 and 2 are the host susceptibility genes identified in animal models for HIVAN. Two variants (g1and G2) in the ApoL1 gene have been identified as the susceptibility alleles that contribute to the increased risk of FSGS in African Americans (previously attributed to MYH9 on chromosome 22) [135].

Nephrotic syndrome and chronic renal insufficiency are late manifestations of HIVAN. Children with HIVAN are likely to develop transient electrolytic disorders, heavy proteinuria, and AKI due to systemic infectious episodes or nephrotoxic drugs. Early stages of HIVAN can be identified by the presence of proteinuria and \u201curine microcysts\u201d along with renal sonograms showing enlarged echogenic kidneys. Urinary renal tubular epithelial cells are frequently grouped together to form these microcysts, which were found in the urine of children with HIVAN who had renal tubular injury [128]. Advanced stages of HIVAN typically present with nephrotic syndrome with edema, heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and few red or white blood cells in urinary sediments. Hypertension may be present, but usually blood pressure is within or below the normal range. HIVAN in adults follows a rapidly progressive course, with end-stage renal disease developing within 1\u20134 months, but in children this rapid progression does not necessarily occur. Definitive diagnosis of HIVAN should be based on biopsy results, and biopsy should be performed if a significant proteinuria is present, because in approximately 50 % of HIV-infected patients with azotemia and/or proteinuria (>1 g/24 h) who undergo renal biopsy, the specimen will have histologic features consistent with other renal diseases [134].",

Similar responses have been reported to treatment with corticosteroids in various studies; however, steroids are not currently recommended for the routine management of HIVAN. There has been short-term improvement in kidney function in children with lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, but there is the risk of exacerbation of infection with TB when used in developing countries, and in the absence of HAART, it has not been shown to limit the progression of HIVAN in children [126\u2013128].",

Mortality is therefore still close to 50 % within the first year of dialysis. In general, improved survival is associated with younger age at initiation of hemodialysis and with higher CD4 counts. Complications such as infection and thrombosis tend to occur at a higher rate in HIV-infected hemodialysis patients. Cross infection with HIV in dialysis patients is very rare. Peritoneal dialysis is an alternative for HIV-infected patients. The incidence of peritonitis varies across studies, but some studies did report a higher incidence of Pseudomonas and fungal peritonitis in the HIV-positive population [148]. Infections with unusual organisms such as Pasteurella multocida, Trichosporon beigelii, and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex have also been reported. Several studies, however, have suggested that there is no significant difference between the HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected populations. Of note is that virus capable of replication in vitro has been recovered from the peritoneal dialysis effluent, and it can be recoverable for up to 7 days in dialysis bags at room temperature and for up to 48 h in dry exchange tubing [148].",

In uncomplicated dengue, the fever usually lasts 5\u20137 days. Shortly after onset, a maculopapular rash appears, sparing the palms and the soles, and is occasionally followed by desquamation. Fever may reappear at the onset of the rash.",

Increased capillary permeability is suggested by hemoconcentration, edema, and pleural effusions [163]. In severe cases, hypotension and shock supervene, largely as a result of hypovolemia. Renal manifestations include oliguria, proteinuria, hematuria, and rising urea and creatinine. AKI occurs in patients with severe shock, primarily as a result of renal underperfusion. However, glomerular inflammatory changes may also occur. Children with dengue hemorrhagic fever show hypertrophy of endothelial and mesangial cells, mononuclear cell infiltrate, thinning of basement membranes, and deposition of IgG, IgM, and C3. Electron microscopy shows viral particles within glomerular mononuclear cells [164].",

The incubation period is 4\u201342 days. Although HFRS occurs with the same clinical picture in children as in adults, both incidence rates and antibody prevalence rates are very low in children under 10 years of age. Mild cases are indistinguishable from other febrile illnesses. In more severe cases, fever, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, and dizziness are associated with the development of periorbital edema, proteinuria, and hematuria. There is often conjunctival injection, pharyngeal injection, petechiae, and epistaxis or GI bleeding. The most severely affected patients develop shock and renal failure. The disease usually passes through five phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic, and convalescent. Laboratory findings include anemia, lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin and bleeding times, and elevated levels of fibrin degradation products. Liver enzyme levels are elevated, and urea and creatinine levels are elevated during the oliguric phase. Proteinuria and hematuria are consistent findings. The renal histopathologic findings are those of an interstitial nephritis with prominent hemorrhages in the renal medullary interstitium and renal cortex. Acute tubular necrosis may also be seen. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals deposition of IgG and C3, and the GBM, mesangial, and subendothelial deposits may be seen on electron microscopy [171].",

This, together with the fact that antimalarial treatment does not affect the progression of the disorder, raises the possibility that factors other than malaria might be involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the disorder.

The variable patterns of renal disease throughout Africa may no longer reflect a dominant role for \u201cmalarial glomerulopathy,\u201d and the relative causative role of tropical infections in nephropathy remains an unanswered question [190].

Volume expansion with either colloid or crystalloid results in improvement in hemodynamic indices and reduction in acidosis [194]. However, a phase 3 randomized trial of 20\u201340 ml/kg albumin, saline, or maintenance fluids only showed increased mortality in patients receiving bolus fluids [195]. This surprising finding has been intensively debated, and bolus fluids have been part of standard resuscitation measures for children with critical illness worldwide. A likely explanation for the adverse affects of fluid bolus is that deterioration in pulmonary or neurological condition was associated with fluid administration. As the trial was conducted in African countries where ventilator support was not available, it is not clear that the findings can be extrapolated to settings where ventilator support and modern intensive care are available. However in the light of this trial, routine volume expansion with colloid or crystalloid is currently not recommended for children with severe malaria in settings where intensive care monitoring and support is not available.",

Blackwater fever has become rare since 1950, when quinine was replaced by chloroquine. However, the disease reappeared in the 1990s, after the increase in use of quinine because of the development of chloroquine-resistant organisms. Since then, several cases have been described after therapy with halofantrine and mefloquine, molecules similar to quinine (amino alcohol family) [196]. Renal failure generally occurred in the context of severe hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinuria, and jaundice. The pathophysiology of the disorder is unclear; however, it appears that a double sensitization of the red blood cells to the P. falciparum and to the amino alcohols is necessary to provoke the hemolysis. Histopathologic findings include swelling and vacuolization of proximal tubules, necrosis and degeneration of more distal tubules, and hemoglobin deposition in the renal tubules.

AKI caused by systemic candidiasis or obstruction of the renal tracts with fungal hyphae is a well-recognized complication of systemic candidal infection. Indwelling catheters (which form a nidus for persistent infection) should be removed [205]. Successful treatment of nonobstructing bilateral renal fungal balls by fluconazole either alone or in combination with liposomal amphotericin B has been reported [206]. In the presence of obstruction, however, percutaneous nephrostomy to relieve the obstruction with anterograde amphotericin B irrigation, coupled with systemic antifungal therapy, is the mainstay of treatment. Amphotericin B is the most effective antifungal agent, but it is not excreted in the urine. Local irrigation via nephrostomy provides good results, however. For treatment of urinary tract candidiasis, it is usually combined with fluconazole or 5-flucytosine, both of which are excreted in high concentrations in the urine. Treatment is required for weeks to months to ensure complete elimination of the fungus, and the ultimate outcome is largely dependent on whether there is a permanent defect in immunity.",
