The diagnosis of these two species is achieved generally by specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain (RT-PCR) reaction methods. In this study, a real-time RT-PCR was developed using a common pair of primers-probe (HPIV-1+3) for the simultaneous detection of both HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 genomes. Results obtained in a 10-fold dilution series assay demonstrate a high sensitivity of the assay with a lowest detection limit of approximately one plasmid copy for both HPIV-1 and HPIV-3. A comparison of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 clinical sample detection between specific HPIV-1/HPIV-3 pairs of primers-probes and the HPIV-1+3 combination clearly shows that the latter is significantly more sensitive (gain of about five threshold cycles) than the former for HPIV-3 detection, while equivalent values are observed for HPIV-1. The HPIV-1+3 combination constitutes a more rapid, more sensitive, and less expensive alternative than classical or multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays usually used in clinical laboratories.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "a b s t r a c t"}, {"text": "\u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 genomes are characterized by a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA of about 15,000 nucleotides encoding for six genes. HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants, young children, and immunocompromised individuals (Apalsch et al., 1995; Henrickson, 2003; Karron et al., 1994; Mufson et al., 1973; Singh-Naz et al., 1990; Welliver et al., 1982; Wendt and Hertz, 1995; Whimbey et al., 1993) . At the upper respiratory tract level, HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 infections are associated with pharyngitis, otitis, conjunctivitis, and croup. HPIV-1 is considered to be the most frequent cause of croup. At the lower respiratory level, these viruses are known to cause tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis (a characteristic feature of HPIV-3) and pneumonia (Monto, 1973; Vainionpaa and Hyypia, 1994) . Studies suggest that HPIV may cause up to 40% of acute viral respiratory tract illness in children (Reed et al., 1997) . In addition, HPIV-3 has been linked also to meningitis in both children (Arguedas et al., 1990; Arisoy et al., 1993) and adults (Vreede et al., 1992) .

Nucleotide sequences of these primers and probe are shown in Table 1 . Based on this finding, a unique reverse primer (PIV1-3 R) and probe (PIV1-3 probe) were able to be designed to detect all HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 genomes, whereas the use of two forward primers (PIV1-3 F1 and PIV1-3 F2) was required. However, PIV1-3 F1 and PIV1-3 F2 are similar in length, position and differ only at three positions in their sequences (Table 1) . Primers and probe were screened by NCBI nucleotide BLAST to exclude any cross-reaction with human cellular sequences or other virus targets. Of note, an alignment was performed including all the above-mentioned HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 sequences as well as 20 HPIV-2 sequences (full-length and partial genomes) and the few HPIV-4 partial sequences available in Genbank. Given that these viruses belong to two different genera (HPIV-2 and HPIV-4 belong to the Rubulavirus genus), this alignment did not allow pointing of any common conserved regions either among the four HPIV species genomes, or between HPIV-2 and HPIV-4 species. Primers were obtained from Invitrogen (Basel, Switzerland). The PIV1-3 probe (Applied Biosystems, PE Europe BV, Basel, Switzerland) was labelled at the 5 -end with the 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and at the 3 -end with the 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) fluorescent quencher.

In concordance with results obtained in the analytical 10-fold dilution series experiment, the HPIV-1+3 exhibits a sensitivity similar to the specific HPIV-1 combination, whereas it is strongly increased (approximately 5 C T on average) compared to the specific HPIV-3 set of primers-probe (mean of C T values comparison between specific HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 primers-probe versus HPIV-1+3 combination: 38.45 \u00b1 5.67 versus 37.33 \u00b1 4.44 for HPIV-1 clinical samples and 33.22 \u00b1 6.01 versus 28.44 \u00b1 5.59 for HPIV-3 clinical samples).
