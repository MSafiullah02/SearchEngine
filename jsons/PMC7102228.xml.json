The clinical manifestations of this disease range from spiking fevers, arthritis, evanescent rash, elevated liver enzymes, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and serositis [1\u20133]. While it is not possible to make an accurate prognosis during the initial presentation of the disease, several clinical characteristics, identified in large patient cohorts, may hint toward a more complicated course (Table 1).\n",

Involvement of an infectious agent, as suggested by the reported temporal relationship between disease onset and prior exposure to viral, bacterial, and other pathogenic organisms has been suspected. This hypothesis is consistent with the pre-eminent role played by innate immunity in this disease. A predisposing genetic background has also been suggested, although no consistent associations with HLA haplotypes or other non-HLA genes has been confirmed [4]. Several proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis; high levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-18; macrophage colony-stimulating factor; interferon-\u03b3; and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) have been detected in sera from patients with AOSD [5]. The clinical response to the empirical use of biologic medications that were originally developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; Table 2) and target these inflammatory mediators has shown promise, thus pointing towards their role in the disease pathogenesis [6\u20139]. Prognosis depends on the course of the disease and tends to be more favorable when systemic symptoms predominate and the disease does not evolve into its chronic articular sub-type. Laboratory abnormalities including neutrophil leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and increased ferritin levels.\n",

It is characterized by an uncontrollable activation of the reticulo-endothelial system within the bone marrow, reticuloendothelial system and central nervous system, with subsequent phagocytosis of hematopoetic cells by tissue macrophages (histiocytes) [20, 21]. Its clinical picture consists of acute high fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly (Table 3). Laboratory findings include pancytopenia and high serum levels of ferritin, triglycerides, and liver enzymes, while, paradoxically, demonstrating a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Although macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is, overall, a very rare condition, it is not uncommon in AOSD, with an incidence of 12\u201314 % in two recent series, a rate higher than other rheumatic diseases [22, 23]. Clinical and biological features of MAS closely resemble reactive hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH) and the disease is in fact considered today as a subclass of HLH (secondary), which is induced by heterogeneous disorders including infections, malignant tumors, and medications [24]. HLH criteria include a decrease in white blood cell count, platelets, or fibrinogen and the demonstration of low or absent natural killer cell activity or soluble IL-2 receptor. However, the minimum threshold level for hyperferritinemia required for the diagnosis of HLH (500 \u03bcg/l) is not useful in detecting MAS, with the ferritin level generally peaking to more than 5,000 \u03bcg/l in the latter condition [25].\n",

            "text": "Preliminary diagnostic guideline used in MAS complicating sJIA was based on a set of laboratory and clinical criteria [27]. The clinical criteria include central nervous system dysfunction, hemorrhage, and hepatomegaly while the laboratory criteria consisted of a low platelet and white cell count, hypofibrinogenemia and elevated AST (Table 4). Early suspicion of MAS is most commonly raised by the detection of subtle laboratory changes, whereas clinical symptoms may be delayed. A recent international effort to identify candidate markers using an expert consensus process identified nine criteria that included a falling platelet count, hyperferritinemia, evidence of macrophage hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow, increased liver enzymes, falling leukocyte count, a persistent continuous fever \u226538 \u00b0C, a falling erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypofibrinogenemia, and hypertriglyceridemia [25]. Hemophagocytosis, seen in bone marrow aspiration and biopsy establishes the diagnosis, even though hemophagocytosis could be seen more frequently in biopsies from the liver, spleen, and/or lymph nodes. Bone marrow aspiration is considered the gold standard and is usually required in atypical cases where there may be a diagnostic dilemma. There is significant overlap between AOSD and MAS and these two conditions are often thought to be anchoring the same disease spectrum, with AOSD representing the milder form. Moreover, it may be a two-way street, with the individual patients\u2019 clinical manifestations fluctuating between those two phenotypes, throughout the disease\u2019s lifespan [22]. It is not unusual for a patient to simultaneously carry both diagnoses, i.e., AOSD and concurrent mild MAS. The similarities in clinical presentation may reflect overlapping pathophysiologic mechanisms. Less severe or \u201csubclinical\u201d cases of MAS may not be diagnosed if they respond to immunosuppressive treatments given for a presumed flare of AOSD [28\u201330]. In 2005, Mazodier et al. published the results of a study showing significantly elevated serum IL-18 concentrations and decreased levels of IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) in the population affected with MAS, when compared to healthy controls [31]. Interestingly, IL-18 has been repeatedly shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis of AOSD and IL-18 inhibition may prove to be a desirable future approach for both entities. A case of AOSD-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has also been reported suggesting the association of IL-18, high levels were seen at onset of disease which dramatically decreased with TMA resolution suggesting the antiangiogenic effect of IL18 [32].\n",

In addition to the reported efficacy, the authors marveled at the avoidance of the potentially toxic immunosuppressant cyclosporine A and/or the antineoplastic agent etoposide [35]. SJIA-associated MAS has required anakinra doses as high as 10 mg/kg/day and, in one published report, combination with abatacept [36]. Recently, a case of AOSD-associated MAS that was complicated by a history of active spinal tuberculosis responded favorably within 48 h to the addition of anakinra to her corticosteroid regimen. Furthermore, there was no tuberculosis reactivation after 10 months of anakinra treatment [37].",

There are several cases of MAS following the use of etanercept in patients with AOSD [37, 39]. In such cases, the observed decreases in ESR and WBC counts may be erroneously interpreted as response to treatment, while in reality they may signify the beginning of MAS. Therefore, MAS should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of AOSD patients with low WBC and platelet counts lacking clinical improvement after etanercept use.",

However, no mechanism, so far, has been able to sufficiently explain their coexistence. It has been suggested that autoantibodies to CD36 (glycoprotein IV) may play a dual role in the pathogenesis of TTP and AOSD, since CD36 is important in the clearance of inflammatory cells and T-cell activation [54]. Alternatively, decreased activity of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif), member 13 (ADAMTS-13) may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of TTP [55]. In the presence of ADAMTS-13 inhibitors (e.g., antibodies against ADAMTS-13), intravascular platelet thrombi develop [56]. The characteristic pathologic findings in TTP include hyalinized thrombi in the vascular beds of the brain, pancreas, heart, and kidneys. TTP is a medical emergency, since the outcome of untreated TTP is renal failure and death [57]. There have been at least 11 published cases of TTP/HUS associated with AOSD, five of which with presenting renal failure [56]. Masuyama et al. reported a case of AOSD complicated by TTP that resulted in retinal microangiopathy and rapidly fatal cerebral edema [53].",

The current mainstay of treatment is plasma exchange because of its efficacy in randomized clinical trials, and relapsing episodes can be managed successfully with additional plasma exchange, aspirin, vincristine, hemodialysis, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, azathioprine, cyclophosphomide, rituximab, and/or splenectomy [50, 56].

It is still a matter of speculation whether the association between AOSD and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is coincidental or if it can be attributed to some common pathogenic link. The first case of chronic AOSD complicated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage during the acute flare of the disease has been reported by Sari et al. in 2009 [61].

Pulmonary microangiopathy, which may also cause renal involvement and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in AOSD patients, has been implicated. Inflammatory mechanisms appear to play a significant role in autoimmune rheumatic-disease-associated PAH, although the mechanisms may differ significantly in AOSD where innate immunity mechanisms have a predominant role. In autoimmune-disease-associated PAH, the presence of antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, IgG, and complement fraction deposits in the walls of pulmonary vessels are characteristic [72]. It is believed that the regulatory T-cells play a role in preventing B-cell activity, and lead to the severe angioproliferative changes. Veno-occlusive disease, formation of microthrombi, and pulmonary fibrosis are also frequently seen. The key histological findings are intimal thickening and media hypertrophy of the small- and medium-sized pulmonary arteries and formation of plexiform lesions. Both the sporadic forms of PAH and those associated with rheumatic diseases are characterized by endothelial proliferation [73].",

Several case reports describe regression of PAH with immunosuppressive therapy in patients with rheumatic diseases [75]. All three groups of advanced therapies; prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors used in idiopathic PAH have also been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and functional status in patients with CTD-PAH [76\u201380]. Biologic agents have been explored as an important avenue in patients, especially in steroid-resistant cases [81]. Anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, has been shown to reduce the systemic inflammatory reactions [82].

Although the prognosis of AOSD is generally favorable, death may occur in some patients due to overwhelming infection, hepatic failure, amyloidosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, macrophage activation syndrome, and pulmonary hypertension [69, 98\u2013101]. Clinicians should be aware of those complications, since early recognition and prompt management in a monitored setting can significantly decrease morbidity and mortality. Treatment efforts should include both supportive measure and coordinated efforts to control the underlying systemic inflammation. High doses of systemic glucocorticoids combined with immunosuppressive agents are usually recommended [102\u2013104]. Targeted therapy with biologic agents, in particular with anti-IL1 and anti-IL6 inhibitors has enhanced our ability to manage refractory AOSD and its associated severe complications [105]. However, the rarity of the disease, diversity of clinical presentation, and lack of controlled studies (especially in AOSD) has limited our knowledge of the exact efficacy and safety of our interventions. For example, novel treatments for AOSD and its pediatric counterpart sJIA have been reported to both effectively treat and potentially induce severe complications such as MAS. This gap in knowledge could be potentially filled by information gathered by prospective, disease specific, registries, and an international collaborative effort.",
