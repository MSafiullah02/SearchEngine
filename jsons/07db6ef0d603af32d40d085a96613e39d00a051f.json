The plant is cardio active and showed antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties. It is used as a pigmentor. The plant showed cytotoxicity against tumors and worms (Baquar, 1989; Rizvi, Saeed, & Zubairy, 2007; Sharma, 2004) . In Chinese medicines, the Psoralea plant is considered warm by nature, and therefore shows many healing actions on kidney and spleen meridians (Daiquan, 2000 (Daiquan, -2006 . The seeds of P. corylifolia are used in indigenous medicine systems for healing of various ailments. The seeds are diuretic, aphrodisiac, laxative, anti-helminthic, and are used in febrile conditions. In Ayurveda, the seeds are used in the form of paste and as an ointment for external as well as internal use for treatment of different conditions such as alopecia, inflammation, leukoderma, leprosy, psoriasis, and eczema (Huang, 1998; Judd, Campbell, Kellogg, Stevens, & Donoghue, 1999; SJc, 2015) . In India, the powder of seeds is mixed with haratalabhasma (yellow arsenic) and converted to paste with the urine of cow. This paste is used to treat leukoderma lesions. In another formulation, the mixture of powdered seeds with buttermilk have been used externally for treating ringworm and scabies. The seed oil is taken orally with betel nut leaf for treatment of leprosy. Another skin condition, dermatosis, has been treated with adjuvants therapy of bakuchi (P. corylifolia) with other local plants such as Amalaki and Khadira. Similarly, the oils of bakuchi and Karanja are mixed with Vaseline to treat chronic skin diseases (Khare, 2008) . The seeds of the plant are also considered useful in bilious disorder, snakebite, and in scorpion sting. The seeds are also used in the production of perfumes (Deshaprabhu, 1966; Maisch, 1889; Sharma et al., 2000) . The root of P. corylifolia has shown its effectiveness in dental caries. The fruits are aphrodisiac and have laxative effect, and the leaves are antidiarrheal (Baquar, 1989; SJc, 2015) . The plant is also valuable in treating alopecia areata (Dua, Kumar, Pandey, & Kumar, 2013b) . In combination with Haritka and Gokshura, this plant is used for urinary frequency, and with Ashwagandha and Bala, it is used for treatment of reproductive diseases and cough. In chronic diarrhea and for treating cold symptoms, this plant is used in combination with Nutmeg and Haritaki (Anderson & Voorhees, 1980) . The seeds of Bakuchi in powder form mixed with the decoction of Bibhitaka (Terminalia bellirica bark) and Kaakodumbara (Ficushispida) was effective to treat vitiligo. The infection of ringworm is treated with a combination of Tila (sesame seeds) and Bakuchi (Gupta, Dhar, & Atal, 1978) . A combination of bakuchi with Haratalabhasma provides relief against leukoderma when applied externally (Khatune et al., 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 250, "end": 264, "text": "(Baquar, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 265, "end": 295, "text": "Rizvi, Saeed, & Zubairy, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 296, "end": 309, "text": "Sharma, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 455, "end": 469, "text": "(Daiquan, 2000", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 470, "end": 485, "text": "(Daiquan, -2006", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 911, "end": 924, "text": "(Huang, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 925, "end": 976, "text": "Judd, Campbell, Kellogg, Stevens, & Donoghue, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 977, "end": 987, "text": "SJc, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1469, "text": "(P. corylifolia)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1634, "text": "(Khare, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1815, "text": "(Deshaprabhu, 1966;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1816, "end": 1829, "text": "Maisch, 1889;", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1850, "text": "Sharma et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2026, "text": "(Baquar, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2027, "end": 2037, "text": "SJc, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 2095, "end": 2131, "text": "(Dua, Kumar, Pandey, & Kumar, 2013b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2421, "end": 2448, "text": "(Anderson & Voorhees, 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2709, "end": 2736, "text": "(Gupta, Dhar, & Atal, 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2843, "end": 2865, "text": "(Khatune et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY"}, {"text": "In Japan, the plant extracted with alcohol has been used as an additive in processed foods and pickles (Nadkarni, 1976) .
