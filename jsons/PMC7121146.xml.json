World Health Organisation (WHO) is currently at a Phase 6 alert which refers to the pandemic stage which is characterised by community level outbreaks in at least one other country (than where the first outbreak started). The risk is real as amply demonstrated by the 1918\u20131920 Spanish flu (of type H1N1) which was estimated to have killed approximately 50 million people [13]. Only a few diseases are truly airborne, such as tubercle bacillus (TB), chickenpox and measles, in the sense that they are created in the respiratory tract and emitted as droplets when we sneeze, breath, shout and talk [20]. But other diseases are recognised to have the potential to be spread in the air (and also by contact), such as the Norwalk virus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), C. difficle etc.",

One well-documented case is of an individual vomiting in a large dining room, and the following day 32 people suffered from vomiting and 19 had fever [15]. Recent analysis has also shown that understanding how droplets move in vortical structures ejected from the nose/mouth can have important implications for forensic science [7, 12].",

The effect of this is to significantly increase the droplets residence time which is known as Wells droplet-nuclei hypothesis [23]. This evaporation is quite dramatic as it means that, for example, a solid particle with a diameter of 100 \u03bcm will fall to the ground from a height of 2 m in about 6 s, but a similar sized droplet of pure liquid will evaporate in unsaturated air (at 18 \u00b0C) in 1.7 s and will not strike the ground, Fig. 1 (b). On the other hand droplets with a diameter of >150 \u03bcm will hit the ground before they have time to evaporate. In reality though, droplets ejected from the mouth typically contain about R\ns=1.5% [4] of solid matter and even when the liquid in the droplet completely evaporates, the pathogens still have the potential for recurrent infection. \n",

            "text": "Our focus in this paper is on the movement of droplets within hospital rooms and wards. In this environment the chronically sick and immuno-compromised are based which means that airborne and contact driven transmission can occur and is potentially lethal. Ventilation strategies are prescribed for different areas such as the operating theatre, isolation rooms and general ward. Regulations differ from country to country, but amount to roughly the same, pressure differences between rooms/corridors/toilets and room air changes per hour (ACH). Immuno-compromised patients are placed in positively pressured rooms, while those with infectious diseases, in negatively pressured rooms. The pressure difference is maintained using flap valves and having contrasting inlet and exit volume fluxes. The prescribed pressure difference, between the rooms and atrium, or room and toilet, tends to be quite small (minimum of 2.5 Pa and usually 6 Pa) which means that flow reversal occurs when doors are opened and closed. Tang et al. [19] discussed the case of a nurse acquiring chickenpox from a patient in an isolation room, despite the nurse having never entered the room. The minimum ACH varies from 6 for a ward, 10 for a toilet to 12 for an isolation room. Forced ventilation is typically used in urban hospitals where airborne contaminants are removed by a large ACH and high levels of turbulence to promote mixing. For rural hospitals a combination of natural and forced ventilation tends to be used, where the level of turbulence is lower but the ACH is higher.",

The conclusion from a study of eight hospitals in Lima, Peru was that natural ventilation was more beneficial [8]. A more recent study by showed that for naturally ventilated rooms, the transmission was enhanced because hot breathe in a stratified environment can move horizontally over large distances [18]. Increasing the level of turbulence for instance in an isolation room, is beneficial because this leads to contaminants being uniformly mixed and the mean concentration decreases rapidly due to well-mixed air being removed. But, there are potential dangers for wards where turbulence can lead to material spreading to adjacent beds and cross contaminating other patients. The major question is then, what effect does turbulence have on spreading contaminants, such as droplets in the air?",

PIV measurements were taken of the flow in a forced ventilated hospital room to characterise the levels of turbulence [22].

            "text": "The most general approach to study how discrete elements are dispersed is to use a Lagrangian formulation where each droplet is followed in time using an equation of motion based on considering the balance of forces. In this modelling approach the droplets are assumed to be spherical (of diameter d\np, density \u03c1\np) moving with velocity v in an airflow u. Since droplets of mucus/saliva are much denser than air (\u03c1\np\u223c1000 kg/m3), the equation of motion describing how they move with time is dominated by a balance of buoyancy and drag forces which can be arranged to give: 4 where X=(X,Y,Z) is the position at time t, g is the gravitational acceleration and t\np is the droplet response time. This model is based on a Stokes drag law, where the viscous drag is proportional to the relative slip between the droplet and air (see [6] for instance). Equation (1) is a second-order linear differential equation with a non-linear forcing caused by the air motion [1]. The ability of a small spherical (rigid) particle to respond to changes in the air flow is characterised by a response time t\np defined by: 5 where \u03bc=18.2\u00d710\u22126 Nsm\u22122 is the dynamic viscosity of water and the droplet fall velocity is given by: 6 As the droplet moves it loses mass due to evaporation and for small droplets, the diameter decreases as: 7 where D\ne=6.1\u00d710\u22129 m2/s is the evaporative constant for water in unsaturated air (at 18 \u00b0C) [23]. This is considered by varying the Stokes number with time depending on the initial droplet diameter, d\n0. We nondimensionalise the system of equations using the length 1/k\nI and the timescale 1/u\n\u2217\nk\nI. Equation (4) is unchanged for droplets which lose mass with time (see [5] for justification): 8 where the dimensionless parameters are defined by: 9 where t\np0 and St\n0 are the initial droplet response time and initial Stokes number respectively. Physically, St\n0 measures the ability of the droplet to respond to changes in the air flow. For large St\n0 the droplets move ballistically. \u03b2 is a measure of the time it takes for the droplet to evaporate compared to the eddy turnover time, and \u03b3 is a measure of the acceleration within the air. St\n0 and \u03b2 are related since \u03b2/St\n0=18\u03bc/D\ne\n\u03c1\np. Thus the general dynamics are represented by a two parameter family, St\n0 and \u03b3. The droplet is assumed to evaporate uniformly with time to the point were only 1.5% of the droplet remains. After this, the droplet equation of motion is 10 since the droplet Stokes number is constant after the droplet has evaporated to leave a solid residue (i.e. \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$\\mathit{St}_{0}(1-R_{s}^{2/3})$\\end{document}).",

The effect of turbulence (made of random Fourier modes) has a rather weak effect on the mean settling velocity which is consistent with [16], however the residence time for d\n0=100 \u03bcm approximately doubled, Fig. 2 (a). More striking is the effect of turbulence on how clouds of particles spread in time. Figures 2 (a), (b) and (c) show graphically the size of spread from the mean position as a function of time. This spread is represented in the figure as a spherical possibility region for the droplet. Figures 3 (a) and (b) presents these results in a dimensionless time with R/L increasing with u\n\u2217\nt/L for d\n0=50 \u03bcm and d\n0=100 \u03bcm respectively. The droplet spread was found to be independent of the droplet diameter. This is because after evaporative effects the droplets\u2019 Stokes number is sufficiently small such that the droplets (irrespective of d\n0) will follow the fluid streamlines closely. For short time (and R/L<1), R/L increases according to (u\n\u2217\nt/L)3/2 which is consistent with Richardson dispersion ([3, p. 277], [10]). For R/L>1, R/L\u223c0.8(u\n\u2217\nt/L)1/2, indicating that transport is ultimately diffusive with an effective dispersivity: 14 Also, this radius has been split into its horizontal and vertical components, R\nxy and R\nz respectively, Fig. 3 (c) and (d). This shows that the horizontal spread is greater than the vertical spread. This would be expected as the influence of gravity will have the effect of reducing the variance in the vertical direction. Therefore, the spheres in Fig. 2 are a simplification, as they assume R\nxy=R\nz (in fact R\nxy/R\nz\u22481.25). \n\n",

From [2] a cough or a sneeze has a droplet distribution peak at around 10 \u03bcm. The closest droplet size from these numerical experiments (i.e. 20 \u03bcm), after approximately 1000 s or 20 minutes a droplet might have hit the floor or may still be at a height of 1.5\u20131.6 m, Fig. 2 (c). This is quite remarkable as not only could a droplet be inhaled/ingested by other patients it is likely that staff clothes will come into contact with any remaining droplet aiding indirect (person-object-person) transmission. It should be noted that not all inhaled/ingested droplets will result in disease [24]. However, as it is estimated that a cough or a sneeze has between 3,000\u201340,000 droplets the risk is certainly there. Figure 4 shows that for values of u\n\u2217 and L measured in a hospital [22], a droplet of \u224830 \u03bcm will move nearly 2 m. Considering that these calculations have also been carried out without a mean flow present which is likely to be present in a hospital, they represent quite conservative estimates on droplet spread. Therefore, the concept of bed-spacing, currently recommended to be at least 1\u20132 m apart [25], though some more recent guidelines recommend 2.5\u20133.6 m apart [14], as being sufficiently well-separated enough to significantly reduce the likelihood of infectious agents transmitting between patients in neighbouring beds via coughed or sneezed droplets, is therefore also probably unreliable.",

Homogeneous turbulence was simulated using the well known technique kinematic simulation. The flow was characterised by u\n\u2217 and L (using typical values found in a hospital environment). Three different configurations were considered; no evaporation/no turbulence, evaporation/no turbulence and evaporation/turbulence. Although the first two models have been studied extensively, the third (the effect of turbulence) has not. The effect of turbulence was to significantly increase residence time for larger droplets d\n0=100 \u03bcm. The droplet spread from the mean position showed that droplets can move large distances and that this, together with increased residence time can lead to increased disease (direct or indirect) transmission. Therefore it is not only evaporation but also turbulence which is responsible for the long residence time of the droplet in the air. Taking this into consideration, increased turbulence should be welcome in isolation rooms where there is no risk of infecting other patients and the increased mixing (due to the turbulence) helps decrease the mean contaminant concentration. However, turbulence levels in general wards should be strictly monitored to avoid cross contamination between patients. Therefore this study urges a conceptual shift in how infection control should be approached in modern healthcare settings, particularly in the current global pandemic influenza situation. Hence, perhaps true physical barrier isolation is the only reliable means of isolating an individual infected with an aerosol- or airborne-transmissible infectious agent.",
