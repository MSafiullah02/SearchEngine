We report here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported renal transplant recipient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. This is a 52-year-old man who received kidney transplantation 12 years ago. His overall clinical characteristics (symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT) were similar to those of non-transplanted COVID-19 patients. Following a treatment regimen consisting of reduced immunosuppressant use and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, the COVID-19 pneumonia in this long-term immunosuppressive patient was successfully recovered.",

Next, considering the progress of the patient's illness and his subsequent improvement, immunosuppressive agents were gradually reinstated. However, for the period prior to reinstating oral immunosuppressants, we considered it important to use appropriate doses of intravenous corticosteroids. The immunosuppressive effect of corticosteroids might protect the renal allograft from acute rejection and avoid imminent Addison crisis in the period of the discontinuation of oral steroid; moreover, the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids may also reduce alveolar exudation and relieve systemic symptoms (such as fever or fatigue) caused by the storm of inflammatory factors. 9,10 It is crucial to pay F I G U R E 2 High-resolution computed tomography images before and after treatment. A, Multiple ground glass density lesions were observed in the upper and lower lobe of the lung, some with consolidation, although without obvious subpleural distribution. B, The lesion range enlarged, and new lesions were observed. C, The lesion was almost completely absorbed, leaving only a few blurs attention to the dosage and duration of steroid administration.
