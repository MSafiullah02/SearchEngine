For example, Bartonella species can live in blood without causing disease, producing an asymptomatic bacteremia in the wide assortment of animals that they may infect. Hence, we can no longer assume that blood samples from healthy animals are sterile. The mechanism of Bartonella transmission from animal to animal is not fully understood, but arthropod vectors (ticks, fleas, and lice) are suspected, as well as scratches and bites from infected animals (e.g., cats and rats) [1] [Glossary Vector].",

In some cases, the last event is infectious, wherein a focal bacterial endocarditis precipitates a thrombus that blocks a narrowed coronary artery. It would be folly to believe that the sequence of events that lead to a myocardial infarction can be precipitated simply by injecting an organism into an animal. Later in this chapter, we will see two examples of rare infections for which several conditions must prevail before a disease emerges [4], [5].\u20134.The microorganism must be extracted from the infected experimental animal and demonstrated to be the same microorganism that was originally isolated from the original diseased animal.\n",

In susceptible individuals, the organisms multiply within macrophages. When organisms are released from dying macrophages, additional macrophages arrive to feed, but this only result in the local accumulation of macrophages bloated by bacteria. Whipple disease is a good example of a disease caused by an organism but dependent on a genetic predisposition, expressed as a defect in innate immunity; specifically, a reduction of macrophages expressing CD11b (also known as macrophage-1 antigen) [8]. Whipple disease cannot be consistently reproduced in humans or any other animals, because it can only infect and grow in a small portion of the human population.",

In the case of Whipple disease, the infected individual must be exposed to a soil organism, limiting the disease to farmers and gardeners. The organism, residing in the soil, must be ingested, perhaps by the inhalation of dust. The organism must evade degradation by gut macrophages, limiting disease to individuals with a specific type of defect in cell-mediated immunity, and the individual must have disease that is sufficiently active to produce clinical symptoms.

A prion is a misfolded protein that can somehow serve as a template for proteins of the same type to misfold, producing collections of nonfunctioning protein globs that accumulate, causing cells to degenerate. The cells of the body that are most vulnerable to prion-produced disease are the neurons of the brain. The reason for the particular sensitivity of neurons to prion disease relates to the limited ability of neurons to replicate (i.e., to replace damaged neurons with new neurons), and to repair damage occurring in their uniquely long cytoplasmic extensions (e.g., axons).",

It is significant that PrP(C) knockout mice [i.e., mice with no PrP(C)] are essentially normal at birth, and survive over the following months with only marginal behavior deficits [29]. Animals that lack PrP(C) are completely resistant to all forms of prion-induced disease, simply because they lack any protein that can be converted to a pathogenic form. Hence, it is important to understand the role of PrP(C), if we plan to develop drugs that treat or prevent prion diseases based on targeting the PrP(C) molecule.",

In particular, it has been suggested that the disease known as multiple system atrophy (MSA) with parkinsonism may qualify. MSA is a CNS disorder that develops very slowly, and produces a progressive loss of autonomic nervous system function. In MSA, there is always an accumulating ball of sticky, misfolded alpha-synuclein protein, observed as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in glial cells. In 2015, it was shown that a neurodegenerative disease could be transmitted to transgenic mice expressing normal human alpha-synucleoprotein, after injection with a brain homogenate prepared from human MSA cases [34].

As another example, patients with HIV/AIDS are susceptible to two different skin conditions that closely resemble one another: bacillary angiomatosis and Kaposi sarcoma. Bacillary angiomatosis is an exaggerated overgrowth of small vessels of the skin, produced by infection with species of Bartonella (i.e., B. quintana and Bartonella henhenselae). Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer of vascular origin (i.e., a type of angioscarcoma) that is caused by Herpesvirus-8. Both bacillary angiomatosis and Kaposi sarcoma look very similar by gross examination and by microscopic examination with standard histological stains (i.e., Hematoxylin and eosin stains). Both bacillary angiomatosis and Kaposi sarcoma occur in AIDS patients, but their respective prognoses and treatments are very different. The correct diagnosis requires an astute pathologist who understands and anticipates the rare and the common causes of vascular proliferative lesions in immune-compromised patients [Glossary Hematoxylin and eosin].\u2013The list of nonpathogenic organisms is growing shorter.\n",

Blastocystis hominis was a eukaryotic organism seen as an incidental finding, of no known significance, on stool examinations. For a long time, the proper taxonomic classification of this organism was undetermined, and it has been variously referred to as a yeast, a fungus, an amoeba, a flagellated single-celled eukaryote, or a sporozoan (former name for apicomplexan), at various times [40]. Today, Blastocystis is considered a genus belonging to the heterokonts, and is the only heterokont known to produce a human infection. Infection follows ingestion of the cyst through the fecal-oral route. Most infections do not result in any clinical symptoms, but sometimes, a syndrome mimicking irritable bowel syndrome may occur. Among individuals who have microscopic school examinations, for any reason, up to 25% of specimens contain Blastocystis [41]. Because Blastocystis is found in the stools of healthy individuals, the finding of the organism in the stool of a symptomatic patient does not necessarily establish a causal relationship. Treatment with metronidazole, an antibiotic effective against eukaryotes and prokaryotes, has its advocates [42], [43], but can we do better? Blastocystis is the only heterokont known to cause disease in humans, and we know almost nothing about the heterokonts that would help us design a drug that would be effective against Blastocystis. Our experience with Blastocystis reminds us that as we may discover pathogens belonging to classes of organisms that were previously thought to be devoid of infectious agents. In such cases, we will need to find new, class-specific antibiotics.

The bacterial organisms that invade via indwelling devices include species of Pseudomonadales, Bacillales, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Legionallales. Despite their taxonomic diversity, all these organisms seem to share an ability to secrete biofilms over surfaces, and to glide through the biofilms they create. Biofilms are invisible, slimy coatings, composed of polysaccharides and cellular debris that provide sanctuary from the antibacterial sprays and solutions used in hospitals. Bacterial species that can glide through a biofilm can track a catheter into the body. For example, Staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal organism that lives on human skin.

Roughly, here is how it works [57], [58]:\u20131.Genus-specific rRNA oligonucleotides are prepared as fluorescent probes.\u20132.The rRNA probes are incubated with a mixture of organisms.\u20133.The target organisms are detected ( via fluorescence in situ hybridization).\u20134.The fluorescent organisms are extracted and examined by ancillary methods (e.g., scanning electron microscopy, culture) to determine the species name of the organism.\n",

In the aforementioned case of gene-based diagnosis of childhood meningitis caused by leptospirosis, we note that an astute clinician may have reached the same diagnosis sooner, and without state-of-the-art technology. Empirically, it is known that children with meningitis whose cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen does not grow organisms will have leptospirosis in about a third of cases [59]. The diagnosis could be confirmed quickly using older technology that directly tested for the presence of the suspected organism (rather than laboriously searching through a large database) [59]. We should be prepared to accept that there will always be circumstances wherein a gene-based diagnosis must give way to common sense.\u2013Some diagnoses can only be established by highly specialized laboratories. Some of these laboratories were created to find the cause of epidemics, not of isolated illnesses. Under normal conditions, empiric treatments may be a practical alternative to precision diagnoses.\u2013Sometimes, it is faster and more effective to deduce a diagnosis than to resort to sequence analyses.\u2013Sometimes, precision diagnosis can be overly sensitive, detecting sequences of contaminants or detecting organisms that are present in such low numbers that they could not have caused the disease.\u2013Sometimes precise diagnoses are mistaken. Aside from sample contamination, which is a persistent problem whenever tiny quantities of diagnostic material are analyzed, we must be prepared to encounter instances when DNA sequences, thought to be characteristic of a species, are found in other organisms [60], [61].\u2013Sometimes precise diagnoses will be irreproducible by other laboratories examining samples of the same specimen. The difficulties in verifying and reproducing the results obtained through precision measurements are a matter of deep concern to those who regulate new diagnostic tests [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77].\n",

If the disease causes fever and signs of inflammation and responds to anti-inflammatory medication, then we can infer that the condition involves a primary disorder of the inflammatory system, or a secondary disorder (such as the response to an infection). If the disease arises as an epidemic, then an infection or a newly introduced environmental toxin is likely to blame.

Gluten peptides are resistant to complete proteolytic digestion and enter the small intestinal lamina propria (i.e., the layer just beneath the epithelial cells lining the gut) where they elicit a strong, local immune reaction [78] (i.e., a disease of immunity). Recent literature suggests that the inflammatory response to gluten is primed by reovirus infection (i.e., a microbial infection) [79].

As in celiac disease, there seems to be a genetic component to the syndrome, with about 75% of affected individuals having the Human Leucocytic Antigens B27 marker.

The disease stunts normal growth of the brain, and produces seizures. During the seizures, the neck muscles do not support the weight of the head, resulting in a characteristic nod, emphasized in the name of the disease. It was noticed that nodding disease occurs in areas where river blindness is endemic. River blindness is the second most common cause of infectious blindness worldwide and occurs in individuals infected by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus [82]. The nematode migrates to the eyes, where a peculiar secondary infection takes control of the pathogenic process. Wolbachia pipientis happens to be an endosymbiont that infects most members of the filarial Class Onchocercidae [83]. It is the Wolbachia pipientis living within O. volvulus that causes the local inflammatory reaction that leads to blindness.",

Endemic to the Keshan region of Northeastern China, this disease, first reported in 1935, produces a cardiomyopathy, mostly in boys under 15 years old and women of childbearing age. This disease is often fatal, and thousands of deaths were reported in its peak incidence years (1960\u201370). Knowing that the region with the highest incidence of disease corresponded to a region with selenium deficiency, Chinese authorities treated spring crops with sodium selenite. It worked. The incidence of Keshan disease dropped in the areas where the crops were sprayed [85]. In 1981, a report came out indicating that Keshan disease patients had high levels of antibodies against Coxsackie virus, a virus known to produce cardiomyopathy [85], [86]. Current thinking would suggest that Keshan disease occurs in individuals whose hearts are weakened by selenium-deficient individuals, and who subsequently become infected with a virulent and cardiotoxic strain of Coxsackie virus [4].",

Although the origin of aggregates of misfolded protein in Alzheimer disease is unknown, we see such changes, to some degree, in the brains of virtually every individual who dies at an advanced age. We tend to credit such changes to long-term effects that accumulate in aging (i.e., nonrenewing or postmitotic) cells.

The evidence so far would seem to indicate that individuals with chronic gingivitis have higher than normal incidence of the disease, the organism can infect brains, and that toxins produced by the organism and found in the brain are neurotoxic [88], [89]. We need not speculate on the potential significance of finding that a bacterium is an underlying cause of Alzheimer disease. Clinical trials, as they say, are underway. The point emphasized here is that diseases of unknown origin are often caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and infectious conditions that work in steps, over time.

For instance, two binomials legitimately apply to the same organism: Filobasidiella neoformans (the teleomorphic form) and Cryptococcus neoformans (the anamorphic form).

As a stop-gap measure, they invented the Kingdom Protozoa, the class of all one-celled animals, the parent class of all multicellular organisms. Kingdom protozoa was a pseudoclass, consisting of all manner of organisms that were not closely related to one another, and which contained organisms that should have been assigned to separately named classes of single-celled eukaryotic organisms [94]. Many decades passed before taxonomists caught up with the blunder, and reassigned individuals in class protozoa to proper classes of their own. Nonetheless, biologists are unwilling to abandon long-cherished terminology. Taxonomists who should know better have pleaded to retain obsolete and misleading plesionyms, such as \u201cprotist,\u201d \u201cprotoctista,\u201d and \u201cprotozoa\u201d on the grounds that doing so will enhance communication and facilitate teaching [95]. They make a fair point, but surely the chief objective of science is to correct misconceptions, not perpetuate them. We have seen some evidence of progress. For example, the Society of Protozoologists, founded in 1947, has seen fit to update their name to Society of Protistologists, in 2005. It would be asking too much for them to change their name, once more, to the awkward but accurate \u201cSociety of single-celled Eukaryotic Organisms.\u201d In this book, the term \u201cprotozoa\u201d is avoided altogether.",

The Sauropsids and the Synapsids are the first classes of animals to lay their eggs on land or to retain eggs in gestating mother. To do so, the embryo acquired a set of protective extra-embryonic membranes (i.e., allantois, amnion, and chorion). If the Sauropsids (including future birds and reptiles), and synapsids (including future mammals) belong to Class Amniota, it would seem only fitting to presume that Class Amphibia, whose eggs lack an amnion, would be a subclass of Class Anamniota. This would be a mistake, insofar as none of the classes of animals other than the Sauropsids and Synapsids, and their descendants, have amnions; hence, the anamniotes do not constitute a sensible class of animals [Glossary Negative classifier].",

For example, Class Reptilia is a descendant of Class Sauropsida, but the pairing of present-day amphibians with present-day reptiles creates a grouping with a tenuous phylogenetic relationship. Furthermore, among the members of Class Reptilia are birds, which are not studied by herpetologists. In summary, the field of herpetology covers animals of two distantly related classes, but excludes certain subclasses of animals within its member classes (i.e., excludes birds). Herpetologists should choose one or two classes of animals to study, and not confuse the rest of us with a name that violates the laws of biological classification.",

The most common stain used in pathology laboratories. With H&E staining, the nuclei of cells are blue, and the cytoplasm is pink. Without staining, cells are colorless (except for those cells that are pigmented, such as melanocytes), and the anatomic parts of the cell (nucleus, cell membrane, nucleolus, brush borders, etc.) cannot be easily distinguished. The development of histologic staining techniques in the 19th century was among the most important advances in medical science.Negative classifier A negative classifier is a feature whose absence is used to exclude an organism from a taxonomic class; it is the riskiest way to assign classes. A species may lack a particular feature because none of its ancestors ever had the feature, as might be the case in a valid lineage of organisms. An example is the Collembola, popularly known as springtails, a ubiquitous member of Class Hexapoda, and easily found under just about any rock. These organisms look like fleas (same size, same shape) and were formerly included among the true fleas (Class Siphonaptera). Like fleas, springtails are wingless, and it was assumed that springtails, like fleas, lost their wings somewhere in evolution's murky past. However, true fleas lost their wings when they became parasitic. Springtails never had wings, an important taxonomic distinction separating springtails from fleas. Today, springtails (Collembola) are not classed with fleas or with any member of Class Insecta. They belong to Class Entognatha, a separate subclass of Class Hexapoda. Alternately, taxonomists may be deceived by a feature whose absence is falsely conceived to be a fundamental property of a class of organisms. For example, Class Fungi was believed to have a characteristic absence of a flagellum. Based on the absence of a flagellum, the fungi were excluded from Class Opisthokonta and were put in Class Plantae, which they superficially resembled. However, the chytrids, recently shown to be a primitive member of Class Fungi, have a flagellum. This places fungi among the true descendants of Class Opisthokonta.Nomenclature A nomenclature is a listing of terms that cover all of the concepts in a knowledge domain. A nomenclature is different from a dictionary for three reasons: (1) the nomenclature terms are not annotated with definitions, (2) nomenclature terms may be multiword, and (3) the terms in the nomenclature are limited to the scope of the selected knowledge domain. In addition, most nomenclatures group synonyms under a group code. For example, a food nomenclature might collect submarine, hoagie, po' boy, grinder, hero, and torpedo under an alphanumeric code such as \u201cF63958.\u201d Nomenclatures simplify textual documents by uniting synonymous terms under a common code. Documents that have been coded with the same nomenclature can be integrated with other documents that have been similarly coded, and queries conducted over such documents will yield the same results, regardless of the term is entered (i.e., a search for either hoagie or po' boy will retrieve the same information, if both terms have been annotated with the synonym code, \u201cF63948\u201d). Optimally, the canonical concepts listed in the nomenclature are organized into a hierarchical classification [103], [104].Problematica The term \u201cproblematica\u201d is used by taxonomists to indicate a class of organism that defies robust classification [105]. The very existence of this term tells us that taxonomy is a delicate and tentative science. We must always be prepared to examine and test our current classification, and to make corrections wherever warranted.Proximate cause Synonymous with the immediate cause. The proximate cause of a biological event is the closest action that can be held responsible for the cause of the event. For example, the rupture of a blood vessel in the lung may be the proximate cause of death, while an invasive lung cancer may have been the underlying cause of death. The erosion of a vessel by tumor cells was one of the sequence of events leading from the underlying cause of death to the proximate cause of death. The underlying cause of death satisfies the \u201cbut-for\u201d condition. But for the lung cancer, the vessel would not have eroded, and blood would not have flooded the lung tissue. The proximate cause of death need not be a necessary condition resulting from the underlying cause of death. Had the vessel not ruptured, the individual may have died from an alternate proximate cause (e.g., metastasis, pneumonia).Root cause The earliest event or condition that is known to set in motion a chain of additional events that can result in some specified result. The term \u201croot cause\u201d is preferable to another term \u201cunderlying cause\u201d that is often applied to the same concept. Any of the events that precede a result could be construed as underlying causes. The term \u201croot cause\u201d conveys the idea of a first or earliest event in a multievent process.Of course, we can never be certain what the earliest event is in any process. For example, infections from Naegleria fowleri result from exposure to free-living organisms in their natural habitat (pond and river water). The organism travels from the nose to the brain, where it causes a meningoencephalitis. It seems self-evident that Naegleria fowleri is the root cause of Naeglerian meningoencephalitis. Maybe not.Because these organisms are widely found in water, it is presumed that millions of people are exposed to the organism, but only very few individuals develop meningoencephalitis. It is not known why most people are unaffected by the organism, while others develop a rapidly progressive meningoencephalitis. Perhaps the root cause of disease is a very specific deficiency in the host defense system, rendering a few individuals susceptible to infection with a ubiquitous organism. If so, the root cause shifts from the organism to the host.Even in the simplest of cases, it is difficult to assign a root cause with any certainty. We never know if we've looked backwards far enough. Still, we do the best that we can, and we apply the term \u201croot cause\u201d with the understanding that we may need to modify our thinking, if evidence of an earlier event comes to light.Serotype Subtypes of a species of bacteria or virus that differ in their surface antigens.Serovar Same as serotype.Unclassifiable objects Classifications create an hierarchical collection of classes, and their taxonomies assign each and every named object to its correct class. This means that a classification is not permitted to contain unclassified objects; a condition that puts fussy taxonomists in an untenable position. Suppose you have an object, and you simply do not know enough about the object to confidently assign it to a class. Or, suppose you have an object that seems to fit more than one class, and you can't decide which class is the correct class. What do you do? Historically, scientists have resorted to creating a \u201cmiscellaneous,\u201d \u201cproblematica,\u201d or \u201cincertae sedis\u201d (uncertain placement) class into which otherwise unclassifiable objects are given a temporary home, until more suitable accommodations can be provided [105].Historically, the promiscuous application of \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d classes has proven to be a huge impediment to the advancement of the biological sciences. In the case of the classification of living organisms, the class of protozoans stands as a case in point. Ernst Haeckel, a leading biological taxonomist in his time, created the Kingdom Protista (i.e., protozoans), in 1866, to accommodate a wide variety of simple organisms with superficial commonalities. Haeckel himself understood that the protists were a blended class that included unrelated organisms, but he believed that further study would resolve the confusion. In a sense, he was right, but the process took much longer than he had anticipated; occupying generations of taxonomists over the following 150 years. Today, the former members of Kingdom Protista have been reassigned to positions among the animals, plants, and fungi. In the meantime, therapeutic opportunities for eradicating the so-called protozoal infections, using class-targeted agents, have no doubt been missed [3]. For practical reasons, textbooks still use the term \u201cprotozoan,\u201d but strictly speaking, Kingdom Protista no longer exists [95].You may think that the creation of a class of living organisms, with no established scientific relation to the real world, was a rare and ancient event in the annals of biology, having little or no chance of being repeated. Not so. A special pseudoclass of fungi, deuteromycetes (spelled with a lowercase \u201cd,\u201d signifying its questionable validity as a true biologic class) has been created to hold fungi of indeterminate speciation. Currently, there are several thousand such fungi, sitting in a taxonomic limbo, waiting to be placed into a definitive taxonomic class [3], [46].Underlying cause The event that initiated the sequence of events leading to some clinical outcome (e.g., disease). Death certificates require physicians to list the underlying cause of death. The World Health Organization, aware of the difficulties in choosing an underlying cause of death, and assigning a sequential list of the ensuing clinical consequences leading to the proximate cause of death, has issued reporting guidelines [106]. Instructions notwithstanding, death certificate data are notoriously inconsistent, giving rise to divergent methods of reporting the diseases that cause death [107], [108], [109].Reluctantly, we must acknowledge that, in any biological system, we can seldom designate the underlying causes with any certitude. One event may lead to many other events, and events which we believe to be initiating may have their own predicative causes.Vector An organism that moves a disease-causing organism from one host to another. Diseases spread by vectors include malaria, plague, leishmaniasis, African trypanosomiasis, relapsing fever, yellow fever, dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus disease, West Nile encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and chikungunya. All arboviruses have arthropod vectors, and there are about 100 known arboviruses that cause human disease [52]. One vector can carry more than one type of infectious organism. For example, a single species of Anopheles mosquito can transmit Dirofilaria immitis, O'nyong'nyong fever virus, Wuchereria bancrofti, and Brugia malayi. Obversely, one disease organism can be spread by more than one vector. For example, orbiviruses are spread by mosquitoes, midges, gnats, sandflies, and ticks.\n",

A dense mycelia composed of tangled hyphae forms the background from which about 10 pod-shaped septate structures are observed. These structures are macroconidia (i.e., large, multiseptate conidia), which grow asexually from conidiophores growing from mycelial hyphae. Conidia are the propagules of fungi, which are swept into the air and water. It is estimated that humans inhale about 40 conidia, of diverse provenance, every hour. Most human encounters with conidia are inconsequential, but infections or allergic reactions may occur in susceptible individuals. It is notable that conidia form in cultured fungi, but are virtually never observed in infected human tissues.",
