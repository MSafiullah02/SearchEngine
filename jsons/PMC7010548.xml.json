These relative abundances and their interaction by time point were both scaled such that a 10% change in abundance was equivalent to a unit change and incorporated as time-dependent covariates into a Cox proportional hazards model with the outcome recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. We used Bayesian methods through a modified version of the rstanarm R package, assuming scaled default prior distributions. This Bayesian approach produces conservative model estimates without the multiple comparison problems found in frequentist approaches.21 Significance was determined by using the 95% high-density interval (HDI) of the posterior distribution of the log hazard ratio (HR) within a region of practical equivalence around zero.",

The relative abundances of these risk bacteria on hospitalization were not associated with recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. However, in the weeks after severe viral infection, enrichment of an infant\u2019s nasal ecosystem with either Moraxella or Streptococcus species increased the risk of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years and recurrent wheezing accompanied by asthma at age 4 years. Similar to the Childhood Asthma Study,12 we also found a separate group of children who at a median age of 9 months (ie, around 6 months after hospitalization), although healthy, had increased Streptococcus species abundance and a greater risk of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. However, it remains unclear why these infants have a later increase in Streptococcus species abundance and, as seen in Fig 3, a later onset of recurrent wheezing. The lack of a significant association with Haemophilus species might have been due to inadequate power, a weaker association, or both. Importantly, we confirmed all of these findings using multiple analytic techniques. Moreover, our joint models demonstrated that the present microbiota findings are independent of multiple other potential confounding factors associated with childhood asthma, including viral cause and IgE sensitization in infancy.",

Log-rank test results indicated that differences in hazard functions of stratified curves were significant for all risk groups.",
