To this end, we take disruptive innovation theory as our point of departure to scrutinize cryptocurrencies as an instance of sociotechnical change. We employ Causal Layered Analysis to develop our four-layer analytical framework to conceptually examine the changes pertained by the diffusion of cryptocurrencies. We provide examples of changes company-level, industry-level as well as societal changes where cryptocurrencies have played a central role. On a company level, cryptocurrencies provide a cost-efficient means for cross-border money transfer and thus pose a significant threat to the existing intermediary-based business models. On an industry level, many central banks are experimenting with crypto-or digital currencies. On a societal level, cryptocurrencies play an important role in particularly when the traditional institutions and societal structures collapse. For example, in Venezuela's recent political and economic crisis, cryptocurrencies contributed to the development of a parallel financial system when the bolivar practically lost its value. Our study provides an analytical framework to systematically evaluate the potential disruptive nature of cryptocurrencies as well as other blockchain-based technologies.",

Five most valuable cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Etherum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS have a total market cap of more than 200 billion USD 1 . The rapid development of blockchain or distributed ledger technologies has paved way for various Financial Technology (FinTech) innovations. Alongside venture capitalists and FinTech startups, major banks and stock exchanges have rolled out blockchain-based products and services. Furthermore, according to Barontini and Holden [4] several central banks have established explorative as well as experimental blockchain-based initiatives as a part of the prospect for central bank-issued crypto-or digital currencies.",

[11] define disruption as \"An agent is disrupted when the agent must redesign its strategy to survive a change in the environment. From the perspective of the system, disruption is an event in which a substantial share of agents belonging to the system is disrupted\" (p. 276). In the realm of digital disruption, Skog et al. [29] dig deeper: they define digital disruption as \"The rapidly unfolding processes through which digital innovation comes to fundamentally alter historically sustainable logics for value creation and capture by unbundling and recombining linkages among resources or generating new ones. Skog et al. further conceptualize digital disruption to pertain three constitutive elements, namely digital innovation, digital ecosystem, and value logics. They define digital innovation as \"process of combining digital and physical components to create novel devices, services or business models, bundling them to constitute and enable market offerings, and embedding them in wider sociotechnical environments to enable their diffusion, operation and use\" (p. 433). Digital ecosystems in turn are \"sociotechnical networks of interdependent digital technologies and associated actors that are related based on a specific context of use\" (p. 433). Finally, they define value logics as \"foundational rationales for designing, bundling and embedding a digital innovation to fruitfully create and capture value\" (p. 434).",
