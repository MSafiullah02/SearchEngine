In many countries strict social distancing protocols and guidelines have been put in place to limit the spread of the disease. Yet, there seems to be a world-wide tendency to negate many of these restrictions, at least within certain subpopulations. In a few countries, there are no formal restrictions on social interaction. The price of not imposing such restrictions, or of defying them, is not easy to quantify and remains ambiguous. Also, it is unknown whether temporary or partially loosening of restrictions, during a weekend or a holiday, has significant impact on the number of infected people or death.",

In order to account for random variability, raw data was smoothed using a moving average with a window size of three days. Then, in order to account for global trends in each time series, the differences between every two consecutive time points (days in this case) were calculated and used for further analyses. Next, autocorrelations were calculated using an independence model method for calculating standard errors (implemented in SPSS, Version 25) using lags ranging between 1 and 16 days. An autocorrelation is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of a given lag. The results represent the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. As such, a significant autocorrelation indicates the presence of recurring pattern such that values in the series can be predicted based on its preceding values. For example, if an autocorrelation with a lag of 7 days is positive and significant, it means that the values of the series tend to repeat themselves every seven days. We hypothesized that autocorrelations with a lag of 7 days will be significantly positive. We considered here significant autocorrelations coefficients that were outside the .

These countries were: Belgium, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the USA and the UK. Fig. 1 presents a sample of the results obtained in a subset of countries (Germany, Sweden, Spain and the USA) selected to demonstrate the variability we observed in the current analysis. Qualitatively, a periodic pattern can be observed in the original time series for Germany, Sweden and Spain (left top panel); this pattern becomes more pronounced in the detrended data (black line, left bottom panels). The autocorrelation analysis (right panels) unequivocally demonstrated the presence of such periodicity in the time series from Germany and Sweden (the other countries with significant periodicity can be seen in Supp Fig. 1&2 ). As stated in the method section, autocorrelations falling beyond the 95% confidence interval are significant at the .05 level. For the US data, significant autocorrelations were obtained with lags of 6 and 8. Since the average of those cycles is 7, the US can be considered to have cyclic death period ranging between 6 and 8 days, with an average of 7 days. Furthermore, the analyses performed on the number of deaths on an additional database 2 for the US, showed a significant autocorrelations with the 7 days lag (see Supp. Fig. 5 ). Taken together, we can therefore consider the presence of seven-day period also for the US. Similar patterns emerge from the analysis of the records of new cases reported daily (Fig 2 [ where 7-day lag autocorrelations were significant for Germany, Sweden and Spain] and Supp Fig 3&4 [ 7-day lag autocorrelations significant for Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and UK]). Here, seven out of twelve countries showed significant autocorrelations with a 7-day lag. These countries were: Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and Switzerland. It should be noted that once such a component is present in the time series, one should expect to see also significant components at multiples of the same fundamental period (i.e 14 days, 21 etc) as can be observed also in analyses presented here albeit only for 14 days as our data is limited to one month.

Higher infection rate during weekend days may stem from lower social distancing, or higher frequency of interactions between young and old individuals during the weekend. Furthermore, as most new cases of COVID -19 occur in people older than 70, and the great majority of deaths are within this age group, we believe that this vulnerable population is infected by younger relatives or friends unaware of carrying the virus. If this postulation indeed accounts for the observed 7-day pattern, many lives may be saved by greater adherence to social distancing, especially during the weekend. In a few countries (e.g., Sweden), the levels of oscillation were more than 50% of the average levels, suggesting large potential for saving lives. In the US, the low range of daily deaths in the period assessed is about 1700, while the high range is about 2500. We believe that social distancing may lower such difference. This potential should be weighed against the expected mental and medical costs of loneliness and isolation.",
