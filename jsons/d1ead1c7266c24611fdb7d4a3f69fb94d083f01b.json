These include significant cardiopulmonary co-morbidity, frequent exacerbations, advanced decline in lung function, malnutrition or other generalized debility, advanced age (> 70 years) and concurrent treatment with corticosteroids. In such patients, an aggressive antimicrobial approach to AECB may be warranted in order to prevent clinical failure or representation.

Patients are subject to acute exacerbations in which there is an acute decline in FEV,, often in association with increased dyspnoea, and production of increased quantities of sputum which may be purulent. Recent epidemiological data from the U.S.A. show that COPD affects an estimated 50 million individuals and is the fifth most common cause of death (1) . Development of respiratory failure during an acute exacerbation of COPD occurs in those whose stable airway function is severely impaired (2) . However, respiratory failure is not the only cause of death in this group; as acute exacerbation of COPD can also result in death due to other causes, such as acute myocardial infarction (3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 11, "end": 16, "text": "[845]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 17, "end": 22, "text": "[846]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 23, "end": 28, "text": "[847]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 29, "end": 34, "text": "[848]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 35, "end": 40, "text": "[849]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 41, "end": 46, "text": "[850]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 763, "end": 766, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 907, "end": 910, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1103, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESPIRATORY MEDICINE"}, {"text": "The role of infection in AECB is a contentious issue. Bacteria and neutrophils are frequently identified in the sputum of patients with AECB, but it is unclear whether they have a causal relationship with the development of exacerbations, or whether bacterial counts are merely allowed to increase as a result of the acute impairment of mucociliary clearance. Studies with antibiotics have revealed a positive, but small effect compared to placebo, in patients with AECB. In the interests of targeting therapy to those who need it most, there are some data that allow us to identify patients who do not benefit from antimicrobial therapy, and others for whom it is probably a mandatory component of management.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESPIRATORY MEDICINE"}, {"text": "Within the trachea, bronchi and medium to small airways of the lung, the respiratory mucosa is normally sterile. During the evolution of COPD in an individual patient, there is a gradual increase in mucus production, depressed ciliary function and epithelial cell injury. Bacteria that are not normally present in the airway below the larynx are then able to colonize the diseased epithelium (4). The association of purulent sputum in chronic bronchitis with Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae was convincingly demonstrated by May (5) . These pathogens, of course, are common colonizers of the upper respiratory tract and they can be recovered from the lower airways even c 1999 HARCOURT PUBLISHERS LTD R. C. READ during stable COPD (6). Monso et al. (7) performed bronchoscopic sampling by protected specimen brush (PSB) of the lower airways of outpatients with stable COPD and compared this with patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. This showed that the prevalence of lower airway bacterial colonization in outpatients with stable COPD is high (25%), mainly due to H. infruenzae in S. pneumoniae, whilst exacerbated COPD is associated with a higher yield (51.7%) of these pathogens and higher numbers of organisms. In patients with more severe AECB, PSB will retrieve a wider range of bacteria including Gramnegative enteric bacilli, Pseudomonas sp. and Stenotrophomonas sp. (8) . Therefore at the very least, even if infection with bacterial pathogens is not the cause of acute exacerbations, they are clearly flourishing in the lower airways in some of these patients, in association with an inflammatory infiltrate (as evidenced by a yield of neutrophils in sputum). Molecular typing of strains of H. influenzae isolated from sputum of patients with COPD has demonstrated that a single strain may persist for many months within the lower respiratory tract mucosa of these patients, and remains present even if there have been acute exacerbations of COPD which have been treated with antibiotics (9). This suggests that Haemophilus infuenzae exists in a state of equilibrium with the host defences, which is lost during exacerbations. During antimicrobial therapy, the equilibrium is restored though the microbe is not eradicated. During chronic colonization there is likely to be a constant balancing act between the host and its bacterial colonizers. On the one hand, host defences include cough, ciliary beating, mucus containing secreted immunoglobulin and lactoferrin, and alveolar macrophages. On the other hand, microbes have adapted to avoid rapid clearance, gain nutrients and survive in the respiratory tract sufficiently to grow and disseminate to other hosts. In the case of Haemophilus injluenzae, the factors which enable the organism to achieve these aims include the production of a polysaccharide capsule, pili, lipopolysaccharide, outer membrane proteins, iron-regulated proteins and factors toxic to ciliary activity (reviewed by Read and Finch) (10).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 548, "end": 551, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1400, "end": 1403, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of infection in AECB"}, {"text": "The pathogens associated with exacerbations of COPD have been summarized by Ball (11) In summary, bacteria are present within the lower airways in most patients with stable COPD.

The studies assessed in this meta-analysis differed in terms of the main outcomes measured (symptom score, days of illness, etc.) so it was able only to report a crude overall effect size relative to placebo, and the effect on peak expiratory flow (PEF), which was reported in the majority of the studies.

Both of the major /?-lactamases are plasmid-mediated and transferable, and so their prevalence is expected to rise with increased use of aminopenicillins in the community.

Moraxella catarrhalis demonstrates almost universal production of p-lactamases and is also resistant to trimethoprim (reviewed by Amyes and Gemmell) (31) . Resistance to p-lactams amongst Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates is due to a stepwise mutation of the penicillinbinding proteins. There is controversy regarding the impact of penicillin resistance of pneumococci on the management of patients with respiratory tract infection. Patients with pneumonia treated with high dose penicillin and subsequently shown to be infected with penicillin-resistant pneumococci, showed no increase in severity of outcome compared to patients with sensitive strains (32) . However, the effect of penicillin resistance amongst pneumococci on outcomes in community-treated AECB, where lower doses of oral agents are generally used, has not been investigated. Pneumococcal resistance is associated with childcare facilities, hospital facilities, antibiotic use and immunocompromise (33) .

Future studies should determine whether use of antimicrobial therapy in these patients affects clinical outcome, quality of life measurements and the likelihood of hospital admission. Of further importance, economically, and in terms of quality of life, is the failure of outpatient management resulting in patients needing to return to their physician.

The majority of patients presenting to their general practitioner will not require antibiotic therapy.

Patients who are ambulant and relatively well with no co-existing illnesses, but who present with two or more 'Anthonisen criteria' can probably be managed by simple therapy with ,&lactams, for example an aminopenicillin, which is cheap and likely to be efficacious in this group.

These include co-amoxiclav, the quinolones and modern macrolides (clarithromycin or azithromycin). In patients with advanced age, or with cardiopulmonary comorbidities or moderately to severely impaired lung function (FEVi <50%), it would seem logical to treat infection with more sophisticated antibiotics in order to ensure microbiological clearance.
