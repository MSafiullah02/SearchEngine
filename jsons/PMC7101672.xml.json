Data were collected retrospectively or prospectively on all patients who had H1N1-2009-related critical illness from April 2009 to August 2009. On April 30, 2009, research ethics board approval was granted by Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre as the central coordinating centre and by each participating local research ethics board. The need for a priori informed consent was waived due to the non-interventional study design. The results of the entire cohort were recently published.10 An additional form was developed and disseminated to allow collection of ECLS-specific data. Herein we present a detailed examination of patients who were supported with ECLS. The use and indications for ECLS were left to the treating physician. For study purposes, indications for ECLS were grouped into broad categories, i.e., hypoxemia, hypercarbia, impossible to ventilate, other, and the worst physiologic data preceding initiation of ECLS were recorded.",

Severity of illness was assessed in adults and children using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and the Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III score,16,17 respectively. We recorded co-morbidities and a priori defined major co-morbidities as the presence of one or more of the following chronic medical conditions: congestive heart failure; cerebrovascular, neoplastic, chronic liver, or renal diseases; and use of immunosuppressant medications.18 Data were submitted to the coordinating centre and checked for errors by manual inspection and electronic range limits.

The average age was 32 yr and 67.3% were female (Table 1). Six of these patients were unresponsive to conventional therapy and were treated with ECLS. Although there were no standard inclusion/exclusion criteria, all ECLS programs were heavily influenced by the criteria outlined in the Conventional Ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR) trial,19 with hypoxemia (P/F ratio < 100 on FiO2 = 1.0) being the primary indication for ECLS in our series. These patients were profoundly hypoxemic (mean PaO2/FiO2 61 mmHg) and hypercapneic (mean PaCO2 70 mmHg) one hour before the start of ECLS. Three patients were treated with high frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV); all received inhaled nitric oxide during their ICU stay, and two had hemodynamic instability requiring intravenous inotropic medication. Two patients had a cardiac arrest before initiation of ECLS. Table 2 outlines the ECLS patient characteristics.\n\n",

Left ventricular function was normal in all patients; one patient who had previous Tetralogy of Fallot repair had mildly impaired right ventricular function. Right ventricular systolic pressure was normal in three patients, mildly elevated in one patient, and significantly elevated in the remaining two patients. All patients were cannulated peripherally, and all circuits were heparin-coated. For three patients who were treated with vv-ECMO, the circuit utilized a Rotaflow pump and a Quadrox D oxygenator (Maquet-Dynamed, Markham, ON, Canada). For the fourth patient, the circuit consisted of a Biomedicus (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Medos 2400LT oxygenator. Cannulation for ECMO consisted of drainage from a femoral vein with return to the contralateral femoral vein via a long single stage cannula advanced to the level of the inferior vena cava/right atrial junction. To improve blood flow, three patients required insertion of a third cannula in the right internal jugular vein. Two patients were supported with the Interventional Lung Assist (iLA, NovaLung GmbH, Talheim, Germany). This device does not employ a pump in the circuit. Cannulae are inserted in the femoral artery and vein, and blood flow is driven across the device by the arterial-venous pressure difference.",

At present, there is no consensus on absolute indications or contra-indications to ECMO or iLA. Initiation guidelines vary among centres and are based mostly on personal and institutional experience. As the H1N1-2009 pandemic evolved, however, ECLS teams received requests for this therapy. The many uncertain aspects of the pandemic further clouded the decision-making process. Specifically, the course of the disease was uncertain, as was the number of potentially affected individuals. Nonetheless, as more patients developed ARDS due to H1N1-2009 infection, it became clear that an attempt at ECLS would be required in some young, otherwise healthy individuals.",

However, it is challenging to identify patients who will not respond to more conventional therapies. Numerous studies have shown that ECMO is not beneficial and may be associated with increased mortality if offered to all patients who have ARDS according to the consensus criteria.20 In 1979, the first randomized trial comparing ECMO with conventional ventilation for treatment of ARDS reported a survival rate of < 10% in both groups and no significant difference in mortality.21 However, there has been recent interest in non-randomized studies supporting the use of ECMO in adults who have severe hypoxic respiratory failure.22\n",

In this study, 180 patients were prospectively randomized to treatment in centres that deliver ECMO or to treatment in centres that deliver conventional ventilation.19 While the investigators were able to demonstrate an improvement in the composite outcome of death/cognitive dysfunction in favour of ECMO, there was no difference in all-cause mortality.23 Furthermore, although these were patients with severe ARDS, ECMO was not the sole therapy in that treatment arm. With proper patient selection, the mortality among patients who have the most severely impaired gas exchange treated with ECMO can be lowered to approximate the mortality of those patients not requiring ECMO.24-28 The Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) influenza investigators recently reported their experience with ECMO for respiratory failure secondary to H1N1-2009 infection in ANZ.29 In this series, ECMO usage for H1N1-2009 infection was frequent (68/201, 33.8%), whereas it was infrequent in Canada (6/168, 3.6%). The time from intubation to initiation of ECLS in ANZ was also shorter, i.e., mean two days vs mean five days in our series, although gas exchange parameters immediately prior to the initiation of ECLS were similar. The sole method of ECLS used in the ANZ series was vv-ECMO. Survival rates in both series were similar.",

Proposed as an alternative to the full ECMO, the pumpless iLA circuit has demonstrated benefit in severe hypoxemic lung failure (PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 65 despite optimized ventilator settings).30 Although this device is most beneficial for carbon dioxide removal, it may also improve oxygenation. The indications for iLA have therefore been extended by some to include the prevention of ventilator-associated lung injury during the early phase of ARDS.13 This concept recognizes the inability to limit plateau pressures and tidal volumes in a situation of grossly diminished respiratory compliance without causing severe hypercapnia and profound respiratory acidosis. However, there are no published clinical trials regarding this device. The Canadian critically ill H1N1 patients were characterized by a hyperacute disease process and rapid deterioration, often within hours of hospital admission. Our limited experience of iLA for H1N1-infection cannot determine whether this treatment is effective. The results from a multicentre trial (XTRAVENT, Clinical.Trials.Gov. identifier NCT00538928) may provide further insight into the utility of this therapy. As such, iLA therapy should be considered experimental at the present time, and treatment should be offered in the context of clinical investigation.",
