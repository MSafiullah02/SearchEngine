            "text": "Water is the most basic and irreplaceable need of our ecosystem. Water is not only a universal solvent but also a vital resource for life to sustain. With an exponential rise in the anthropogenic activities and illicit management, water pollution has been spiraled and resulted in an escalation of waterborne diseases (WDOs) all over the world. The microbiological pollution in waterbodies is an issue of serious concern. According to reports of UNICEF in 1995 (The state of the world's children. Oxford University Press, Oxford), waterborne pathogens accounted for approximately 5 million deaths per year, out of which half was accounted for children. Waterbodies' surfaces and groundwater contain number of pathogens that may pose serious threat to human health. Thus, the need of water disinfection is an undeniable issue worldwide (Ong, 2016). Bacteria (Burkholderia pseudomallei, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Plesiomonas, Campylobacter spp., Shigella spp., etc.), cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Anabaena, Planktothrix, Nostoc), viruses (adenoviruses, enteroviruses, astroviruses, hepatitis A viruses, hepatitis E viruses, noroviruses, sapoviruses, rotavirus), prions, protozoa (Acanthamoeba spp., Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium, Balantidium coli, Isospora belli, Naegleria fowleri, Toxoplasma gondii), cysts, fungi, helminths (Dracunculus medinensis, Schistosoma spp.), Rickettsia, etc., are variety of microbes proved fatal to human beings and pose serious threat to aquatic systems as well (Seo et al., 2012). Bacterial pathogens may lead to infections such as typhoid, cholera, intestinal infections, etc. On the other hand, cyanobacteria produce microcystins that may prove lethal to human systems. Virus pathogens cause serious health issues such as conjunctivitis, throat sores, abdominal inflammations, rashes, fever, respiratory disorders, and enteric infections. Protozoan cells such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia are reported to cause human gastroenteritis, while fungal cells produce mycotoxins that induce inflammations in respiratory tracts and digestive systems (Kumar et al., 2014a, Kumar et al., 2014b). A detailed account of pathogens and disease related with them has been summarized in Table 19.1\n.",

            "text": "Every year millions of people lose their life because of these WDOs all around the world. Waterborne pathogens pose serious global challenges and around 800 million populations is diploid of safe and consumable water. Biological contamination of water needs to be curbed and water disinfection techniques are the methods to tackle these pathogens. The history of water purification dates back to around 1804 in Scotland where world's first citywide municipal water treatment plant was set up using sand filter technology. The earliest mode of disinfection was introduced by Humphrey Davy in 1814 using chlorine, which was further brought into application of water disinfection around 1902. Few years later, ozonation was introduced as new pathway for water disinfection. From then, treatment of waterborne pathogens has traveled a lot through. Even today chlorination is used as a method for water disinfection in not only many developing countries but also in the United States and some developed nations in Europe because of its simple application and cost-effectiveness. Extensive techniques have been implied for the termination of biological pollutants including physical processes such as adsorption, heating (boiling), distillation and filtration, biological processes in the form of activated sludge, chemical processes such as flocculation and chlorination, light irradiation, and photocatalysis. Disinfectants are not only limited to combat microbial pollution but they also help in eliminating taste and color, oxidize iron and manganese in waterbodies, and enhance coagulation and filtration activity. The inefficiency of common chemical disinfectants (chlorine, chloramines, ozone, chlorine dioxide, etc.) has steered need of more efficient systems for pathogenic inactivation. Also, the side products of these conventional disinfectants are haloacetic acids, chlorite, haloacetonitriles, dibutyl phthalate, and chloral hydrate formed because of the reaction between these disinfectants and natural organic materials and had been reported to be carcinogenic, teratogenic, and highly mutagenic (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004, Wei et al., 1994). The highest amount of disinfection by-product is chlorate followed by bromochloro-, bromodichloro-, dibromochloro-, and tribromoacetic acid, trichloronitromethane, and chloral hydrate (Muellner et al., 2007). These conventional techniques for disinfection of water have been proved to be unsuitable in the long term. There are number of side effects and limitations that have been proposed for conventional techniques of pathogen inactivation. There are around 600 by-products of disinfection reported so far and all the conventional oxidants that are being used as disinfectant have been reported to produce side products that are very harmful for the living systems. The nonspecificity of conventional disinfectants poses another threat for the living systems as higher doses are required to carry out disinfection (Lee, 2015). Limitations of current disinfectants can be listed as follows (Muellner et al., 2007):\u2022Tedious preparation and application because of their harmful and rapid degradation attributes.\u2022Short range of antimicrobial ability.\u2022Harmful by-products during and after their use.\u2022Harmful to human beings.\u2022Storage is arduous.\u2022Highly corrosive for any equipment or surface.\u2022Unsafe disposal.\n",

            "text": "These conventional techniques are not only slow but also some of them such as filtration creates lots of sludge, another toxic waste which needs to be disposed and tackled (Catalkaya et al., 2003). Adsorption has been the most common method for the removal of pathogens especially bacteria and fungi from the system because of their easiness and highly efficient features. Removal of viruses is a tough task as they are very small in size and thus easily pass through theses filters (20\u201390 nm). As time goes by, some of the pathogens such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia are reported to develop resistance to chemical disinfectants. It means high doses of these chemicals are required to kill these pathogens, as a result of which more and more disinfection by-products are added to system. A large extent of works has been already done for studying the adsorbents and their applications for pathogens removal in the past many years. However, issues such as high cost of equipment, separation challenges, disposal, and other reasons limit the application of adsorbents in removal of pathogens (Hao et al., 2010, Zhang, 2003). Till date no chemical disinfectant has been proved sufficient for complete sterilization and disinfection (Favero, 2007, pp. 31\u201350). Therefore, development of eco-friendly, highly robust, and advanced techniques with higher efficiency has become the need of time.\n",

            "text": "Nanomaterials are characterized on basis of their size, morphology, and the charge they bear on their surfaces. Many advanced microscopic techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are already available to determine their size distribution, average diameter, morphology of the nanomaterial surfaces, and their shape. These parameters play an important role in determining their physical stability and in vivo particle distribution which is mostly controlled by their size and surface charge (Bhatia, 2016, pp. 33\u201394). A deep insight into these physicochemical properties leads a vast understanding regarding the application of nanomaterials in various fields. Some of the important characteristics have been mentioned below:(a)\nParticle size: Particle size holds important information of studying the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles, their biodistribution, and their retention the tissues. Smaller the size of nanoparticle, larger the surface area it possesses. The small size of nanomaterials facilitates its easier cell penetration (cell wall and cell membrane), thereby promoting cellular dysfunctioning. Cellular uptake of nanomaterials is inversely related to their particle size. Many advanced techniques are available, which helps in determining the size of the nanomaterials that are listed here:\nPhoton-correlation spectroscopy (PCS) or dynamic light scattering (DLS): It qualifies to be the most admired and speedy technique that determines the nano- and submicron ranges of Brownian nanoparticles in a colloidal suspension. The mode of determination of particle size involves Doppler shift due to Brownian motion of nanoparticles against monochromatic light beam (LASER). The interaction of light beam with particle results into shift in the wavelength of incoming light which is used to correlate the size and motion of the particle in the colloidal suspension (DeAssis et al., 2008).\nScanning electron microscopy: It is the most customary method to ascertain shape, size, and surface morphology of the nanoparticles. They help in directly visualizing the morphology of nanomaterials; however, their information about size distribution and average population tends to be of limited benefit. The technique is costly and time-consuming and requires complementary information for the data accuracy (Molpeceres et al., 2000) (Fig. 19.1\n).\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM): It provides image, diffraction patterns, and spectroscopic data of the material. High-resolution TEM imaging can be coalesced to nanodiffraction, atomic resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (AREES), and X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (X-ray EDS) techniques to investigate their properties in advancement. They have much more advancement when studying biological sample as compared to thick-stained section studies.\nAtomic force microscopy: The technique is also known as scanning force microscopy (SFM). A probe tip of atomic scale is used to physically scan samples at submicron level. The method holds an advantage above every morphological study process. The study of biological samples in AFM requires no specific treatment and therefore easily provides details for biological and delicate polymeric samples. It provides the most accurate data for size, size distribution, and morphology and hence is most suitable method for studying the interaction of nanomaterials with biological samples (Polakovic et al., 1999, Cho et al., 2013).Other techniques include differential centrifugal sedimentation (DCS) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which are new methodologies based on high resolution and are quite useful for biological systems such as proteins, DNA, and RNA (Sikora et al., 2016).\n(b)\nMorphology and surface area: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive technique for analyzing exact elemental ratio, composition, and bonding nature of elements in the nanomaterials. Their vibrational characteristics can be studied by FTIR and Raman spectral analysis. The fingerprint region of these spectral data provides exact information of the nanomaterial and peak shifts are important revealing factor for detecting the extent of functionalization. The surface area of nanomaterials is studied by Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) technique. The large surface area of nanomaterials makes them available to diverse applications ranging from catalysis, medical, and environmental to many other advanced technologies (Saeed and Khan, 2017).(c)\nSurface charge and surface hydrophobicity: The interaction of nanomaterials with the biological system is largely determined by their surface charge and intensity. The surface charge is indirectly determined through zeta potential measurement. Zeta potential plays an important role in determining the stability of colloids (nanoparticle) as well as knowing the intensity of electrostatic attraction between biomolecules and the nanoparticles. High value of zeta potential in either direction (positive or negative) is an indicator of high stability of the colloidal solution.Surface hydrophobicity can also be determined with zeta potential values. Besides, other methods for the determination of hydrophobicity include hydrophobic interaction chromatography, biphasic partitioning, probe adsorption, and contact angle measurements. The latest advancement in the field of studying surface hydrophobicity involves X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, which determines surface hydrophobicity as well as identifies chemical groups (or functional groups) also on their surface (Scholes et al., 1999, Pal et al., 2011).(d)\nElectronic and optical properties: The electronic properties of nanomaterials also control most of its optical properties. The optical properties of nanoparticles are mostly dependent on its size and surface property. Nobel metal nanoparticles show strong absorption in UV-visible region. Localized surface plasma resonance (LSPR) is the phenomenon that provides a deep insight of electrooptic property of the nanomaterials. Optical property determination is an important factor in determining the photocatalytic activity and hence the application of the nanomaterials. A core analysis of photocatalytic activity helps in deducing the mechanism for photochemical reactions. Using the basic principles of photochemistry (Grothus-Draper's law, Beer\u2013Lambert law), the characterization of optical properties can be largely done. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopic (DRS) measurement technique is on such method that assists in determining the photoactivity of nanomaterials in terms of absorbance, reflectance, luminescent, or phosphorescent properties. Besides DRS, photoluminescence and null ellipsometer are other means to derive optical properties of these nanoparticles. UV-Vis DRS also helps in determining the bang gap in semiconductor nanomaterials. Bandgap lets us know the photocatalytic activity and material conductivity of these nanomaterials.(e)\nMagnetic and mechanical properties: Magnetic activity of certain nanomaterials is another important benefit and can be applied in field of catalysis, biomedical techniques, and MRI as well as water remediation. The uneven distribution of electrons leads to formation of magnetic moment in these nanomaterials. The mechanical strength of nanomaterials is measured in terms of modulus, stress, strain, adhesion, or friction. Mechanical properties are necessary for studying effect of porosity, particle size, filled composites, and polymer-based nanocomposites of various kinds of nanomaterials. Magnetic properties of some metals are visible at nanoscale such as for Au or Pt. Ferromagnetism is observed in case of nano-Pt and nano-Pd due to structural changes (Alagarasi, 2009, pp 45\u201360).\n",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are not actually human inventions. Their presence in nature dates back to the time of origin of Earth. Various geological and biological activities have added variety of nanoparticles into the system. Naturally occurring peptides, celluloses, chitins, and many other such biological nanoparticles have been studied for their applications in various fields. Peptides are the class of biomolecules that form the protein structures in living systems. Cellulose nanoparticles are most promising biopolymers in nanotechnology. Their high mechanical strength and robustness make them a perfect material for nanomembranes. The surface of cellulose can easily be functionalized and therefore can be switched for variety of purposes (Moon et al., 2011). Chitins \u03b2-(1\u20134)-poly-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine are most abundant polysaccharides derived from many organisms including some fungi and insects. They can be easily processed into membranes and nanofibers. Chitin nanoparticles (50\u2013100 nm) were prepared from acid hydrolysis and ultrasonication of chitin (Barikani et al., 2014). Chitosan is a naturally obtained material from the arthropod shells, crustaceans, fungi, and algae and has been reported for its antimicrobial activity. It is the second largest naturally occurring biopolymer after cellulose. They are nontoxic, mucoadhesive polymers formed by deacetylation of chitin. Chemically, chitosan is similar as cellulose with a \u03b2-(1\u20134) glycoside bonded 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose monomers. Chitosan is potential bactericide against a range of pathogens especially Gram-negative bacteria (Chung et al., 2003). Chitin and chitosan have widely been applied to fabricate nanopolymer scaffolds in many nanomembrane-based antimicrobial systems (Don et al., 2005). Curcumin nanoparticles (2\u201340 nm) obtained from wet milling technique was effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Penicillium notatum, and Aspergillus niger (Bhawana et al., 2011).",

They serve as an excellent material for water treatment over other macromolecules because of their higher ratio of surface area by volume. There are varieties of methods to synthesize these nanomaterials such as laser applications, discharge tubes, and chemical vapor deposition techniques (Kumar and Kumbhat, 2016, pp. 189\u2013236). The carbon-based nanomaterials may be functionalized or nonfunctionalized with hydroxyl (\u2013OH) and carboxylic acid (\u2013COOH). The functional groups are attached through covalent or noncovalent interactions and tend to increase the dispersion in water as compared to their nonfunctionalized graphene as well as increase their adsorption properties (Kuila et al., 2012, Upadhyayula et al., 2009). Functionalization serves two major prerequisites for their environmental application, i.e., (1) it increases the hydrophilicity of carbon-based nanomaterials such as CNTs, GO, etc., making them more stable and highly dispersed in aqueous media, which leads to exposing microbes and contaminants to a larger surface area, and (2) it allows tuning the surface of nanomaterial according to the sorbate for higher electrostatic interaction with sorbent (Vukovi\u0107 et al., 2011). CNTs are synthesized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs). Some of the factors that affect the activities of these nanomaterials include pH, functional groups, ionic strength of the solution being used, and presence of organic matters (Smith and Rodrigues, 2015). CNTs are highly flexible and hence are very suitable to capture bacterial cells. Their flexibility (both SWNTs and MWNTs) has been experimentally verified on Streptococcus mutans bacterial colony, where the growth was stagnated on introduction of these CNTs (Akasaka and Watari, 2009). Fullerol suspension inactivated bacteriophage MS2 by photosensitization (Badireddy et al., 2007). Graphenes can be used as hydrogels, thin film membranes, recoverable nanocomposites, or electrodes in the treatment of microbial contamination of wastewater. They wrap around cell or enter cell membrane and interact with, leading to cell disruption and cytotoxicity (Zeng et al., 2017).",

These studies indicated varying activity levels and prove to be very reliable in future (Mauter et al., 2018). Nanotechnology in past few years emerged as highly advanced and reliable technique in many areas including water treatment units. Exploiting nanotechnology in treatment of contaminated water has been proved to be breakthrough in water purification. Their application ranges from detection, monitoring, and possible solutions of eradication of waterborne pathogens (Anjum et al., 2016a). Their extremely small size (1\u2013100 nm) and larger surface area make them highly reactive, thereby providing greater activity for treatment of polluted water. Nanomaterials hold a wide range of application in today's world. They may be utilized as attached to a substrate, i.e., immobile or free nanoparticles. Nanosilver (AgNP), CNTs, nano-TiO2 (P-25), and many others such as nanomaterials form an integral part of daily life. Their application has not only been restricted to research and pharmaceuticals but also now their application has extended to electronic devices, catalysis, fillers, etc. Current research fields focus on more and more implementation of nanotechnology for the solid waste management and wastewater treatment because of their miscellaneous antibacterial activity. Their small size and large surface areas tend to increase their chemical activities. The removal of heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium, thallium, and lead has been extensively targeted in the role of nanotechnology as water treatment technology. It has also been hinted that there is less chance of developing resistance toward these nanomaterials as compared to classical antibiotics (Pal et al., 2007). Silver nanoparticles, silica-based nanocomposites, TiO2 nanoparticles, and carbon-based nanomaterials have proved their outstanding role in the treatment of pollutants in aqueous systems. Silver nanoparticles show an excellent bactericidal property (Weir et al., 2008). Noble metal nanoparticles show an excellent result for the disinfection of E. coli. SWNTs and MWNTs have been reported to be excellent filter for virus adsorption and inactivation than other routine filters. Nanofiltration membrane technologies are even effective for pathogens such as Cryptosporidium oocytes that have been major concerns in some developed nations also (Anderson et al., 2011). Some of the advantage that lies in implying nanotechnology for water treatment includes point-of-use techniques, time economy, high efficiency, simple treatment methods, and space saving (Nassar, 2013, pp. 52\u201365).",

Derivatives of chitosan such as N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan, N-propyl-N,N-dimethyl chitosan, and N-furfuryl-N,N-dimethyl chitosan tend to have higher antimicrobial activity and can perform at high pH also (Qi et al., 2004, Holappa et al., 2006).",

They serve as an excellent antimicrobial agent when compared to traditional or conventional adsorbents because of their larger surface area and high surface area-by-volume ratio (Kang et al., 2007). The surface area of SWNTs is around 407 m2/g, which can remove bacterial and virus contaminants up to 3.18 \u00d7 1012\n CFU/mL and 107\u2013108 PFU/mL, respectively (Brady-Est\u00e9vez et al., 2008). Moreover, SWNT shows specificity to certain bacteria that increase their application for on point use as sensor and also developing filters. Affinity of SWNT for B. subtilis is 27\u201337 times higher than conventionally used powdered activated carbon. Bacterial biofilm formation of E. coli and B. subtilis can be reduced significantly by applying SWNT and GO coatings (Rodrigues and Elimelech, 2010). The factors that control the cytotoxicity of carbon-based nanomaterials mainly include shape, size, surface area, functional groups, surface charge, and their chemical constituents. Larger surface area of these nanomaterials promotes their higher antimicrobial activity. The dispersed samples of CNTs showed more toxicity as compared to the aggregates of CNTs and activity of these CNTs increases two- to threefolds on adding functional groups to these nanotubes for bacterial species such as S. aureus, E. coli, and B. subtilis (Murugan and Vimala, 2011, Mauter and Elimelech, 2008).",

The larger diameters of these MWNTs tend to reduce the antimicrobial activity of nanotubes. The sharp endings of SWNTs cause cell membrane puncturing on interacting with the microbial cell. The smaller diameter of them pushes the bacterial cell to produce more stress-related gene products (Kang et al., 2007). Experiments on the expression of genes showed that mechanism for membrane damage, repair and lipid recycling, such as the fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation, glycolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways were highly enunciated in the presence of SWNT as compared to that of MWNT. The studies further stated fatty acid uptake from neighboring media is due to the \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids. These fatty acids were obtained from the lipid breakdown. These lipids discharged into the media by cell membrane disruption or cell death in the presence of SWNT. The fatty acid biosynthesis pathway is regulated by the synthesis of new lipid molecules which are to be incorporated into the cells for cellular mechanisms such as cell growth or membrane repairing caused by the nanomaterial. Cells need to produce more and more energy under the stress situations. In the presence of SWNTs, it was observed that cells showed high rate of glycolysis (the energy producing phenomena) to combat the stress created on the cell due to these SWNTs. Cell also needs high amount of acetyl-CoA, which are by-product of glycolytic pathways, to synthesize fatty acids to repair damaged cell membranes (Kang et al., 2008).",

Formation of toxic peroxides (H2O2\n\u2212) and superoxides (O2\n\u2212) due to carbon-based nanomaterials creates toxic reactions within the bacterial cells. These ROS disrupt the cell functioning by oxidizing the fatty acids in cell membranes and destructing the cells. The higher activity of genes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase in these bacterial cells to detoxify these harmful ROS confirmed this pathway of bacterial inactivation. DNA damage and repair system were also activated in presence of these nanomaterials. The large surface area-by-volume ratio of graphene sheets and other carbon-based nanomaterials serves as an excellent sorbent for bacteria and viruses.

For example, we use a TiO2/GO nanofiber it will adsorb the pathogen as well as shows bactericidal activity photocatalytically.

Their high surface volume ratio and magnetic characteristics can make them efficient disinfectant material when grafted with suitable polymers and also raises their adsorbent property. The easy separation of magnetic nanomaterials facilitates recycling of these materials and hence provides additional benefit over other engineered nanomaterials. Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 are widely used MNPs that have proved their high efficiency against range of bacteria and viruses once they are functionally modified with biocompatible organic or inorganic moieties. One such antibacterial nanomaterial is quaternized poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate), i.e., PQA modified magnetite nanoparticles. They are easily recyclable and can be separated from water after the action on pathogens by applying external magnetic fields. The reported efficiency of this nanomaterial was found to be around 100% for E. coli (Dong et al., 2001). Another such antimicrobial nanomaterial is amine-functionalized (AF) magnetic Fe3O4/SiO2, which were found extensively effective against bacteria and viruses in water (bacteriophage f\n2\n, poliovirus, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Salmonella, B. subtilis). The effectiveness largely depends on surface charge and hydrophobicity of pathogen as well as the material. Pathogen surfaces are negatively charged due to phosphates and carboxyl groups over envelopes covering them and their isoelectric point ranges from 4.0 to 6.0. On the other hand, isoelectric point of amine-functionalized nanomaterial is around 9.0. It was suggested that it was pure electrostatic interaction that prompted pathogen removal with efficiency of 92%\u201393% (Zhan et al., 2014). Quaternary ammonium compounds coated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles serve as dual purpose to treat heavy metal removal as well as bacterial disinfection through quaternary compounds destroying microbial cells and magnetic material to eliminate heavy metals (Zhang et al., 2015). Chitosan-oligosaccharides coated Fe3O4 bonded with cell wall at specific sites and were removed applying magnetic field. The nanoparticles show less agglomeration and are stable over a wide range of pH (Shukla et al., 2015). Functionalization with amine group reported to increase the effectiveness of pathogen removal by 2\u20133 times compared to Fe3O4/SiO2. Amino acid (arginine, lysine, and poly-l-lysine) functionalized Fe3O4 nanomagnets were found effective against both Gram-positive (B. subtilis) and Gram-negative (E. coli) and antimicrobial efficiency was around 95% (Jin et al., 2014).",

They have advancements such as surface functionalization, highly permeable structures and resistance to fouling (Pendergast and Hoek, 2011). Their efficiency, easy and cost-effective designing, and low space requirement make them stand apart and much better than other treatment processes. Some of the common types of nanostructured membranes includes zeolite-coated ceramic membranes, reactive/catalytic ceramic membranes, inorganic\u2013organic membranes, thin film nanocomposite membranes, biologically inspired membranes, vertically aligned nanotube membranes and isoporous block copolymer membranes (Pendergast and Hoek, 2011). Nanomaterial coupled membranes systems were found to be more effective and highly advanced. Researches on such systems not only were biocidal against bacterial cells but they also acted on virus systems. One such progress in this area was electrospinning of carbon fiber cloth with polymers, for example, PANI/PAN/AgNWs-CC nanomembranes. This nanocomposite was highly effective in filtering off E. coli and S. aureus completely without application of external voltage and the AgNWs acted in complete inactivation of bacterial cells within few hours. The electrospinning technique provide a suitable route for modification of pore size as per the requirements and maintain flux amount and prevent fouling as compared to traditional methods of filtration. Electroporation and generation of ROS are the proposed mechanism of action of such nanofilters. Such composite filters serve the dual purpose of pathogen removal by physical membrane filtration and their inactivation through electrochemical disinfection. Some of the major benefits of these polymer-based membranes includes low cost of energy requirements, highly efficient removal of bacteria and its inactivation, and small disinfection contact time, and amount of silver released was very low and up to the standard criteria of 15 ppb. Some experiments carried after coupling membranes with P-25 showed effectiveness against bacteriophage MS2 (Zheng et al., 2017). Novel nano-thorn TiO2, titanate porous nanotube membranes, and TiO2 nanowire-based ultrafiltration membranes were also good in preventing membrane fouling and fighting the microbes (Bai et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2009a, Zhang et al., 2009b).",

One such nanoparticle consists of MgO nanoparticles that show high affinity for Gram-negative bacteria such as (E. coli and B. megaterium) and B. subtilis bacterial spores (Koper et al., 2002). They deeply affect the functioning of the cell membranes and causes cell death. AgNPs are also important in this class of bioactive nanomaterials because of their direct interaction with cell membranes and protein structures. Comparative studies between GO coated and noncoated AgNPs showed that addition of GO increased the bactericidal efficiency of these nanoparticles (Karnib et al., 2013). AgNP electrospinning over cellulose acetate and ascorbic acid reduced silver nitrate in DAXAD 19 (polymerized sodium salt of alkylnapthalene sulfonic acid) are such nanocomposites that have been found effective biocides against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial cells such as E. coli, S. aureus, V. cholerae, Salmonella typhus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa (Son et al., 2004). In addition to silver nanoparticles some other metals, metal oxides and sulfides have been reported to show antibacterial activity. Nanoparticles such as TiO2, Cu, CuO, ZnO, CeO2, and CdS have also shown an effective antibacterial activity (Jones et al., 2008, Kang et al., 2008, Thill et al., 2006, Yoon et al., 2008, Prasse and Ternes, 2010, pp. 55\u201379).",

Cu-doped SiO2 was tested for antibacterial activities against variety of bacteria, fungi, and yeasts such as S. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Penicillium citrinum, and C. albicans at varying compositions and antibacterial activities were seen (Kim et al., 2006). Co-doped ZnO nanoparticles have been applied in targeting waterborne bacterial treatment. They showed an active antibacterial property against S. dysenteriae, S. typhi, V. cholerae, and E. coli with or without sunlight (Oves et al., 2015, Padmavathy and Vijayaraghavan, 2008). Exfoliated graphite/Se/ZnO acted as photocatalyst for dyes as well as antibacterial agent when studied for E. coli and Enterobacter (Sonde et al., 2017). Researchers working on cytotoxicity of Fe (III) oxide found that zero valent and divalent iron is much toxic when studied on E. coli because of their oxygenation tendency which destroys the cells. They create an oxidative stress by generating ROS and disrupting ion exchange across the cell membranes (Auffan et al., 2008). Iron-based nanoparticles also showed antimicrobial activities especially zero valent iron was found to be active against Gram-positive bacteria as well as fungus with 100% efficiency against B. subtilis and P. fluorescens. The best part of using zero valent iron nanoparticles (NZVI) is that it ends up as iron oxide or iron hydroxides which are already present in environment and form an important part of mineral systems (Diao and Yao, 2009, You et al., 2005). Some of the researchers suggested NZVI to be quite effective in dealing with S. typhimurium phage 28B from contaminated water (Rad, 2014, Thesis Chapter, 44 pages). ZnO NPs and its derivatives were found to much effective as compared to other six common metal oxide NPs including TiO2 (Jones et al., 2008).",

Dendrimer-based filters provide an extraordinary opportunity in the field of antimicrobial activity. Not only have they proved to be efficient in fighting the water hardness, but also they established as an excellent filter for toxic metal ions, organic and inorganic contaminants, radioactive wastes, bacteria, and viruses. They are available in various polymeric forms which are monodispersed and extensively branched like randomly hyperbranched, dendrigraft, dendrons, etc. Dendrimers are made up of three units: core, interior branch cells, and terminal branching cells, size of which ranges from 1 to 20 nm (Ottaviani et al., 2000). Dendrimers show an additional benefit for fighting drug-resistant bacteria by following different mechanisms of action. Dendrimer-immobilized biocides are very effective and easy to separate from the systems. Their potency was found to be more than their counterpart small molecules or particles. They have been expected to possess more active time and are less toxic (Diallo, 2014). Dendrimers are very useful as carrier of antimicrobial nanoparticles as they possess a hollow cavity and the surface can be modified for a range of microbes. PAMAM dendrimer (core made of alkyl diamine, exterior made of primary amine, and branches of tertiary amine) based silver nanocomposite is one such material that shows an effective antimicrobial activity against waterborne pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli (Balogh et al., 2001, Savage and Diallo, 2005). High positive charge on biocide dendrimers binds with negatively charged bacterial cell wall through electrostatic interaction and disintegrates the bacterial cell membranes. Biocidal dendrimer attached to antimicrobial terminals such as phospholipids replaces Ca2+ and K+ and neutralizes the surface charge or reverses it. At high concentration they denature membrane proteins and destabilize membrane (bacteriostatic effect) and at extremely high concentration they completely break the cell membrane leading to cell death (bactericidal effect) (Chen and Cooper, 2002). Quaternary ammonium salt functionalized or phosphonium dendrimers of polycarbonates, poly(amidoamine), and poly(propylene imine) were reported by some groups against E. coli and S. aureus (Xue et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2000). The low stability and less knowledge of dendrimers, however, limit its application as biocidal materials.",

            "text": "Photocatalytic activity of nanoparticles is due to the interaction between light and metallic nanoparticles. Photocatalysts are the semiconductor devices that have tendency to degrade a variety of chemicals (organic, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc.) and disinfect range of pathogens (bacteria, virus, fungi, and protozoan cells). Advance oxidation processes (AOPs) appeared as an outstanding application of photocatalysis in disinfecting water. The process of photocatalytic inactivation mainly depends upon nature, morphology and concentration of the catalyst (Sondi and Salopek-Sondi, 2004). Metal oxide nanoparticles such as zinc oxide (ZnO), titania (TiO2), zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4), and tungsten oxide (WO3) based semiconductor materials have been reported for their antibacterial activities (Baruah and Dutta, 2011, Baruah et al., 2012). Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been validated to be the most common photocatalytic nanoparticle to inactivate pathogens in aqueous systems. Pathogen inactivation depends upon many factors, such as concentration of photocatalyst, microbe, intensity of light and its wavelength, degree of hydroxylation, pH, temperature, O2 supply and ROS, and retention time. Ag/TiO2 has been reported for high antimicrobial activity even at 425 nm (Akhavan, 2009) and effective against bacteriophage MS2 (Liga et al., 2011). Ag@ZnO core\u2013shell nanoparticles have been developed to be used against E. coli and were found to be recyclable and reused for around three cycles. They have been practically applied to pond water and municipal water too for studying their activity (Das et al., 2017). Pt/TiO2 are found to be effective against pathogens like E. coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in UV-region (Matsunaga et al., 1985); TiO2/MWCNTs (B. cereus and E. coli); nano-TiO2/acetyl cellulose, carbon-doped TiO2 and N-doped TiO2\n(L. monocytogenes, E. coli); S-doped TiO2 (Micrococcus lylae); Zr-doped titania, and hydroxyapatite supported Ag/TiO2 were reported to be successful in inactivation of endospores of B. cereus and E. coli (Lee et al., 2005, Matsunaga et al., 1988; Reddy et al., 2007, Mitoraj et al., 2007, Swetha et al., 2010, Wong et al., 2006, Yu et al., 2005). Enhanced cytotoxicity was reported in Pt(II) and Pt(IV) doped TiO2, which can clearly be understood from the fact that Pt ions have been known for their inhibitory actions on DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis (Asliyuce et al., 2012). Reports on antimicrobial activities of Au\u2013TiO2 nanoparticles are also present and have been found effective not only against pathogens but also organic contaminants (Ayati et al., 2014).",

They have bandgap of 2.42 eV and can function below wavelength less than 495 nm. As the bandgap is still higher and photocatalytic activity is largely in UV region of light, these nanomaterials are doped with some other active material to bring their activity in visible region. Such nanocomposite materials show a decrease in bandgap and higher photoactivity even in visible region. Ag, Si, Mn, Co, Cu, anions such as nitrogen, etc. Besides these metal-based nanoparticles, laponite nanodiscs loaded with Si(IV) phthalocyanine dihydroxide (photosensitizer) was also applied as photocatalytic materials. They were found to be active against resistant Gram-positive pathogens (Gr\u00fcner et al., 2015). Other issues that need to solved are posttreatment separation of nanomaterials and presence of extracellular polymeric materials (EPS). While the former increases the chances of nanotoxicity, the latter has potential to reduce the photocatalytic efficiency because of competition with bacterial cell for ROS (Chaturvedi et al., 2012). Few points that are necessary to keep in mind while applying photocatalysis and setting photocatalytic reactors are robustness of the process, cost-effectiveness, high sustainability, low risk while exposure, safe photocatalysts, and less chance of catastrophic effects if something goes wrong (Dimapilis et al., 2018).\n",

            "text": "Molecularly imprinted polymers are kind of affinity ligands that bind specifically to a molecule or a substrate to form complexes through ionic, covalent, hydrogen bonding or ligand exchange. They are also known as \u201cPlastic Antibodies\u201d and highly specific for binding with the target molecules. They are less prone to chemical or biological damage and hydrophobic in nature which leads to less chances of reversibility of binding of target with them (Wangchareansak et al., 2014, Volkert and Haes, 2014, Asliyuce et al., 2012). MIPs have been developed in form of nanocomposites have been applied as adsorbents. Designing of MIP is done such that binding is reversible to prevent damage of MIP on binding with target. Recently researchers developed surface-imprinted polymers that binds with influenza virus H5N1 (Wangchareansak et al., 2014). APTES-based MIP integrated on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chip with microfluids was assessed for binding with E. coli bacteriophage MS2 (Altintas et al., 2015). The drawback with MIPs the release of residual template molecules during adsorption phenomena and still there is need of water soluble MIPs (Nnaji et al., 2017, pp. 129\u2013167).",

These nanomaterials are classified into two basic categories: biomimics and biotemplates. It employs the application of biological methods of nanomaterial synthesis and is eco-friendly and highly adaptable (Bhattacharya et al., 2014). The most commonly synthesized bioinspired nanoparticles is AgNPs and mediated through various biomolecules such as carbohydrate (chitosan, glycogens, polysaccharides), plants (Cinnamon, Allium cepa, Mentha, etc.), fungi (Aspergillus, Fusarium, Candida guilliermondii, Trichoderma viride, Phoma sorghina, Penicillium sp.), and bacterial cells (K. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas,\nStreptomyces, Bacillus) (Zinjarde, 2012, MubarakAli et al., 2001, Sonar et al., 2017). Carbohydrate-based AgNPs range from 6 to 13 nm and were highly effective against E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans, and some Gram-negative bacteria while that synthesized using fungi were from 3 to 50 nm (some between 550\u2013650 nm and 10\u2013100 nm also) and were quite effective against bacterial cells mentioned above as well as S. typhi also. Plant-inspired AgNPs were synthesized using parts of plants (barks, leaves, fruit peels, callus) such as Cinnamon zeylanicum bark powder; Sesuvium portulacastrum callus and leaves; leaf extracts of Acalypha indica, S. portulacastrum, Eucalyptus citriodora, Ficus bengalensis, Solanum torvum, Allium cepa, Garcinia mangostana, Mentha piperita; fruit peels of Musa paradisiaca and Citrus sinensis; and Curcuma longa tuber. Such bioconjugated nanoparticles were studied for antimicrobial activity and highly effective against E. coli, S. aureus, V. cholerae, P. aeruginosa, Aspergillus flavus, S. typhimurium, C. albicans, C. lipolytica, E. aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., and Shigella sp, B. subtilis, Fusarium, and A. niger (Sathishkumar et al., 2009, Sathishkumar et al., 2010, Nabikhan et al., 2010, Krishnaraj et al., 2010, Ravindra et al., 2010, Govindaraju et al., 2010, Saxena et al., 2010, Veerasamy et al., 2011).",

Nanofibers are created by applying high voltage to charged liquid or melt using high-voltage supplier through a capillary. They have high surface-to-volume ratio and micron level pore size. Various active antimicrobial nanofibers have been developed in recent years. NanoCeram alumina fibers are electropositive and remove bacteria by size exclusion method. They are much robust and resistant to clogging than most of ultrafiltration membranes (Tepper, 2002). The formation of antimicrobial nanofibers mainly depends upon surfactants and polymers used (Botes et al., 2010, p. 196). One of them includes PAN/GO/CNT-based nanotubes systems for water disinfection, developed using ultrasonicated mode of synthesis and was studied for antimicrobial activities against E. coli and S. aureus (Hussein et al., 2018). Poly (4-vinylpyridine) grafted PU fibers functionalized with hexyl bromide was used as disinfectant against S. aureus and E. coli. Polycarbonate (PC)/chloroform solution of benzyl triethylammonium chloride (BTEAC), Nylon 6 nanofibers with N-halamine additives, Chitosan with PAA and PEGDA were shown to inhibit bacterial cells such as S. aureus, E. coli and K. pneumonia with approximately 80%\u201399.7% efficiency in filtration (Kim et al., 2007, Tan and Obendorf, 2007, Don et al., 2005).

Poly(ethylene oxide) nanofibers coated with AgNPs via electrospunning predominantly antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and K. pneumoniae (Kim et al., 2009). Quaternary amine functionalized chitosan (N-[(2-hydroxyl-3-trimethylammonium) propyl] chitosan) electrospun by PVA and cross-linked to glutaraldehyde was prepared to impart antiviral property (tested for porcine parvovirus, PPV and Sindbis virus, SDV) and stability in water to chitosan nanoparticles (Mi et al., 2014). \u03b2-Cyclodextrin/cellulose acetate nanofibers and chitosan (CTS)-based nanofibers loaded with AgNPs and AgNPs/Fe NPs were found to be effective against B. cereus, E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, S. boydii, and S. sonnei (Nthunya et al., 2016, Nthunya et al., 2017).",

The smaller size and larger surface are facilitates high chemical reactivity as well as adsorption capacity of these nanomaterials. They consist of metallic nanoparticles, mixed oxide nanoparticles, magnetic NPs, etc. CNTs, silica nanotubes (SiNTs), carbon nanosheets, etc., also fall under this category. Their functionality is mainly controlled by various factors such as size, surface morphology, crystal structure, shape, and solubility. Tricalcium phosphate nanoparticles mixed with DNA solution before applying to target cell population showed effectiveness against virus sorption (Link et al., 2007). SWNTs are reported to be better nanosorbents for bacteria (B. subtilis) than any other conventional or any other common adsorbents. Their fibrous structuring and easily accessible surface makes them 37 times better adsorbent for bacteria as well as cytotoxins (Ahmad et al., 2016). Nano-SiO2-AgNPs was proposed as new antifouling adsorbent where Ag reduction was protein-mediated against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. It was reusable, high adsorbing, eco-friendly, cost-effective, high yielding, and even removed dye from the solution (Das et al., 2013). Reusable adsorbent \u201cpebbles\u201d made of nanocellulose AgNPs are found to completely remove heavy metals, dyes and pathogens were made, and efficiency was reported to be above 95% (Suman et al., 2015).",

Unwanted dispersion and disposal of waste have been various possible routes through which nanomaterial is introduced into the system during waste management. Nanomaterial surface having the tendency to modify continuously has been an issue of serious concern for the stakeholders and researchers to a major extent. With the immensely strong potential exhibited by these nanomaterials in the field of environmental science, with a thrust upon water treatment applications, there lies an extensive possibility that they will be exposed to the living system too. This creates a serious concern over their long-term effects on the living systems (Tomar and Kumar, 2017). Ecotoxicity of NPs and nanomaterials being studied and investigations are going on over the effects of nanomaterials on various phyla. Some of the researchers have deduced that the formation of ROS and oxidative stress can cause damage even to the human cells.

A clear risk assessment and risk management systems should be developed before the application of these materials into the systems (Berekaa, 2016). Any new nanomaterial should be examined for cytotoxicity under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restrictions of Chemicals) framework before the introduction (Handy and Shaw, 2007, Handy et al., 2008, Hansen, 2009). Use of easily available, cheap precursors or natural sources can be convincing mode for price drop of them. Polymer-based nanocomposites show more activity and less amount of nanomaterials (e.g., PVK-SWNT) can also be a leap in the field of nanomaterial application with the higher antimicrobial activity. The cytotoxicity of carbon-based nanomaterial can be curbed by blending them with biocompatible polymers to produce their nanocomposites (Ahmed et al., 2012). A reduction in cytotoxicity from 40% to 20% was reported for PEG or bovine serum albumin\u2013coated GO, PEG-based SWNTs nanomaterials showed drop from 80% to 20% and similar effects were observed for graphene (reduction from 15% to 7.5%); however, they showed higher antimicrobial activity than the pure carbon-based nanomaterials (Li et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2001). To prevent the leaching out of metal nanoparticles or such small nanoparticles, it is better to coat them with polymers such polyurethane, PEG, PVA, etc. Combustion can be one of the methods that may be used in case of carbon-based nanomaterials discarded in bulk amount (Bystrzejewska-Piotrowska et al., 2009). The size correlation with toxicity can be an important step in finding the nanocytotoxicity and risk analysis of nanomaterials before their applications (Sayes and Warheit, 2009).",

Irreversible aggregation and dissolution of nanomaterials and then processing the resultant materials is an innovative method suggested by some research groups (Sanchez et al., 2011). Application of biomimetic methods such as aquaporins can be helpful in reducing the toxicity effects of nanomaterials. Multifunctional nanomaterials that combine two or more nanomaterials to treat varieties of pollutants can be one possible solution for reducing the amount of exposure of nanomaterials.",

Some of the steps that can help in monitoring the NPs translocation include studying the exact conditions under which the nanomaterials will be used and studying their effects. Combining two or more analytical techniques is also one of the proposed methodologies for tracking the nanomaterials (Kumar et al., 2014a, Kumar et al., 2014b). Technologies are needed to prevent leaching out of nanomaterials into the system after use as disinfectants. Magnetic nanomaterials can be used as suitable method for disinfection as their removal is much easier by simple application of magnetic field. Their recyclability adds an extra advantage for their application as disinfectant (Li et al., 2008). Models should be developed to track the discharge, translocation, transformation, agglomeration, and uptake of nanoparticles within the environment (Bridle et al., 2015). A global awareness is the need of the time for knowing the toxicity of nanomaterials as well as focus on safe and eco-friendly nanomaterials is to be developed with time.\n",

Waterborne pathogens create a major hindrance in the way of pure water availability. Earlier methods of disinfection defined above hold many of its own drawbacks and some of the pathogens have already developed resistance against these conventional methods. Nanomaterials application in water treatment and contaminant removal holds a highly daunting and promising future than their traditional counterparts, wiping out limitations and side effects of conventional methods. Metal oxide NPs, fullerenes, photocatalysts, nanomembranes, and other such technologies ensure a long-term solution biological contamination of water. Combination of two or more nanomaterials can serve as multipurpose solution to eradicate pathogens as well as dissolved and undissolved impurities. Many of these nanomaterials have also high adsorbent properties, which establish new pathways for development of hybrid system for water treatment techniques. Many carcinogenic chemicals will be discontinued after their cost-effective establishment as water treatment units. The future of safe drinking water can be thrusted up on these \u201ctiny particles.\u201d The tailoring nature of these nanomaterials let the researchers develop more and more sustainable and robust technology.",
