Consolidation in CSS is present, usually mixed with other patterns of abnormalities including small nodules and ground-glass opacity (GGO), and shows random distribution [ 8 ] . Consolidation in radiation pneumonitis involves uniformly the irradiated lung portion, but not necessarily conforming to the shape of the irradiation portal [ 9 ] . The consolidation may show patchy and extensive distribution.",
