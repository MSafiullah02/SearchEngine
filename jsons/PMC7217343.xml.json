The translation method used is consistent with that described by the World Health Organization for such purpose (WHO 2020). The Russian version of the questionnaire was posted online by Moscow State University of Psychology and Education, Penza State University (Russia), and Belarusian State Medical University faculty members to students, colleagues, and friends asking them to invite others to respond.

For example, the findings may be relevant for online training of trainers who, in turn, may work with others to help prevent or reduce COVID-19 fear, stress, and anxiety causing problem behavior such as harmful substance use, domestic violence, and crime. Also, sources of information (e.g., tips sheets on helpful ways of coping) disseminated online or by other means should be considered for intervention purposes.
