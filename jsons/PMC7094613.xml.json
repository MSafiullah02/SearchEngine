Dysautonomia is the most frequently diagnosed condition affecting autonomic ganglia and the disease has been reported in horses (equine grass sickness), cats (Key-Gaskell syndrome), dogs, rabbits, hares and sheep with common clinical signs of oesophageal dysfunction, inappetence and gut stasis (Key and Gaskell, 1982, Pollin and Griffiths, 1992, Griffiths and Whitwell, 1993, Pruden et al., 2004, Hahn et al., 2005, Niessen et al., 2007, Wylie and Proudman, 2009). Histopathological changes associated with dysautonomia are central chromatolysis and fine vacuolation of neuronal cytoplasm, variable numbers of dead neurons, marked neuronal loss and the presence of spheroids (Mahaffey, 1959, Howell et al., 1974, Pogson et al., 1992, Uzal et al., 1992).",

A review of the literature revealed a lack of information on common background changes in bovine ganglia.

However, lesions that were present in very low number, such as neuronal and perineuronal vacuolation, satellitosis and spheroids, were enumerated in each section examined. Gliosis was assessed as diffuse, mild, moderate or severe or nodular and the numbers of nodules were recorded. Inflammation was graded arbitrarily as: absent or mild, representing up to two small foci; moderate, representing up to seven small foci; and severe, representing up to eight or more foci or a focally dense infiltrate. Additional findings such as neuronophagia, changes of the interstitial tissue or peripheral nerve were recorded. Where appropriate, sections were stained with cresyl violet for Nissl substance, von Kossa's stain for calcium, periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) for lipofuscin and toluidine blue for Renaut bodies (Bancroft and Gamble, 2007).",

These were interpreted as artefacts, which are often produced by post-mortem tissue compression or excessive handling during removal of fresh tissue (Summers et al., 1995, Jortner, 2006). In the present study these dark neurons were mainly seen in the cranial cervical ganglion. This is likely related to the location of the ganglion between the vagal nerve and the internal carotid artery and results from inadvertent pressure put on the ganglion during sampling. Acute ischaemia, hyperglycaemia or status epilepticus have been reported to induce similar dark neuronal changes (Summers et al., 1995, Jortner, 2006). Acutely injured neurons, however, are associated with marked oedema and the entire spectrum of neuronal injury up to neuronal necrosis is observed within the section (Jortner, 2006).",

            "text": "The present study was initiated as a consequence of the need to evaluate ganglia from a heifer (C20) with megaoesophagus. Central chromatolysis in 35% of the neurons in the cranial cervical ganglion was the main microscopical change in this case. Dysautonomia was suspected as megaoesophagus is one of the clinical signs associated with the disease in horses, dogs and cats (Wise and Lappin, 1990, Pollin and Griffiths, 1992, Longshore et al., 1996, O'Brien and Johnson, 2002) and central chromatolysis is a hallmark of acute primary dysautonomia of several species (Wise and Lappin, 1990, Whitwell, 1991, Pogson et al., 1992, Pruden et al., 2004, Hahn et al., 2005). In acute cases of equine grass sickness the number of degenerate chromatolytic neurons can vary between 23 and 90% (Brownlee, 1959). However the additional changes of fine vacuolation of neuronal cytoplasm (Howell et al., 1974), large numbers of dead neurons, marked neuronal loss and the presence of spheroids (Mahaffey, 1959, Pogson et al., 1992, Uzal et al., 1992) was not evident in the present case. In addition, three other cattle (C9, C16 and C35) of the study population had marked central chromatolysis (>20% of neurons affected) in the cranial cervical ganglion without exhibiting megaoesophagus. Therefore, it is unlikely that the more widespread central chromatolysis is of significance; however, the cause remains obscure. Clearing of central Nissl substance was commonly observed in ganglia of normal dogs and was attributed to artefact or fixation (Longshore et al., 1996). In the present study autolysis may have contributed to artefactual chromatolysis in one case (C35), but fixation is unlikely to be a factor here as all samples were fixed and processed similarly. Summers et al. (1995) maintained that neurons within ganglia normally have the Nissl substance dispersed to the periphery, but such a wide distribution was not seen in the present study. Mildly chromatolytic neurons have been reported in the cranial mesenteric ganglia of two healthy sheep (Pruden et al., 2004) and are rarely seen in normal bovine brains (Gavier-Widen et al., 2001). Central and peripheral chromatolysis are considered normal findings in certain nuclei in the brain, including the olivary nucleus, pontine and supraoptic nuclei and the lateral cervical nucleus of the spinal cord (Summers et al., 1995). Surprisingly, there was a significant relationship between the occurrence of central chromatolysis and younger age. This has not been reported before and it is difficult to explain as neuronal degeneration is usually associated with older age (Bot\u00e1r, 1966).",

Sporadic intraneuronal vacuolation in human ganglia was considered part of nerve cell degeneration that occurs in all ganglia in healthy individuals throughout life (Bot\u00e1r, 1966). As was the case in the present study, the latter researchers occasionally observed proteinaceous material within the vacuoles (Bot\u00e1r, 1966). Intraneuronal vacuolation is one of the histopathological hallmarks of BSE (Wells et al., 1989), but this disease was ruled out as all control animals and diseased cattle over the age of 48 months were negative for prion proteins.

The fact that it was equally present in animals with and without concurrent disease suggests that it is likely to be an incidental finding. As the majority of cases did not show any evidence of inflammation, the background number of inflammatory cells expected to be found in bovine ganglia is very low. The inflammatory infiltrate consisted of mixed mononuclear cells including T and B lymphocytes as often seen with viral infections (Robbins et al., 2010). Infectious diseases commonly associated with changes in trigeminal ganglia in cattle include BHV1 infection, rabies and listeriosis due to the centripetal or centrifugal spread of infection (Lapi et al., 1952, Charlton and Garcia, 1977, Nandi et al., 2009). There have been no reports that other ganglia may be involved in these diseases. BHV1 or other herpesviruses, including malignant catarrhal fever, were ruled out as causative agents in the present study as no viral DNA was detected in affected and unaffected ganglia by PCR. Although detection of viral DNA in latently infected cattle is difficult, the presence of inflammation usually correlates with viral gene expression (Perez et al., 2006). Another possible cause of the inflammation may be bovine coronavirus infection, as these viruses are ubiquitous in cattle and persist in adults as subclinical infections of respiratory and intestinal tracts (Boileau and Kapil, 2010). Centripetal spread from these sites is conceivable and related viruses cause ganglionitis in other species (Maxie and Youssef, 2007). Immune-mediated diseases of ganglia such as sensory ganglioradiculitis have been described in dogs and characterized by predominantly CD3+ T-cell infiltration with a perivascular, parenchymal and perineuronal distribution (Porter et al., 2002). This is a rare and progressive disease also affecting sensory neurons in the spinal cord and causing severe clinical signs (Summers et al., 1995), which were not reported in any of the study cases. Mild inflammation in ganglia of horses without clinical signs has been reported (Uzal et al., 1992) and as an incidental finding in the brain of various species (Gavier-Widen et al., 2001, Jahns et al., 2006). Similarly, neuronophagia was considered part of a spectrum seen in degeneration and destruction of neurons of autonomic ganglia as occurs in man, even in healthy individuals, at every stage of life and particularly in older age (Bot\u00e1r, 1966). Considering these facts, inflammation, gliosis and satellitosis in bovine ganglia was considered a common incidental finding.",
