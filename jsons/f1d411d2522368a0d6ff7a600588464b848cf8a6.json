This paper presents an end-to-end framework to automate detection of disinformation narratives, networks, and influential actors. The framework integrates natural language processing, machine learning, graph analytics, and a novel network causal inference approach to quantify the impact of individual actors in spreading IO narratives. We demonstrate its capability on real-world hostile IO campaigns with Twitter datasets collected during the 2017 French presidential elections, and known IO accounts disclosed by Twitter. Our system detects IO accounts with 96% precision, 79% recall, and 96% area-under-the-PR-curve, maps out salient network communities, and discovers high-impact accounts that escape the lens of traditional impact statistics based on activity counts and network centrality. Results are corroborated with independent sources of known IO accounts from U.S. Congressional reports, investigative journalism, and IO datasets provided by Twitter.",

In general, more sophisticated NLP techniques that exploit semantic similarity, e.g. transformer models (10), can be used to identify salient narratives. Third, accounts participating in the selected narrative receive an IO classifier score based on their behavioral, linguistic, and content features. The second and third steps may be repeated to provide a more focused corpus for IO narrative detection. Fourth, the social network of accounts participating in the IO narrative is constructed using their pattern of interactions. Fifth, the unique impact of each account-measured using its contribution to the narrative spread over the network-is quantified using a novel network causal inference methodology. The end product of this framework is a mapping of the IO narrative network where IO accounts of high impact are identified.",

Contextually relevant Twitter data are collected using the Twitter API based on keywords, accounts, languages, and spatiotemporal filters specified by the authors. For example, during the 2017 French presidential election, keywords include the leading candidates, #Macron and #LePen, French election-related issues, including hostile narratives expected to harm specific candidates, e.g. voter abstention (11) and unsubstantiated allegations (12). Because specific narratives and influential IO accounts are discovered subsequently, they offer additional cues to either broaden or refocus the collection. In the analysis described in the preceding subsection, 28 million Twitter posts and nearly 1 million accounts potentially relevant to the 2017 French presidential election were collected over a 30-day period preceding the election, and a total of nearly 800 million tweets and information on 13 million distinct accounts were collected.",

Before the internet, the tools used to conduct such campaigns adopted longstanding-but effectivetechnologies. For example, Mao's guerrilla strategy emphasizes-\"[p]ropaganda materials are very important. Every large guerrilla unit should have a printing press and a mimeograph stone.\" Today, many powers have exploited the internet to spread propaganda and disinformation to weaken their competitors.

Situational awareness of semiautomated IO at speed and scale requires a semi-automated response capable of detecting and characterizing IO narratives and networks, and estimating their impact either directly within the communications medium, or more broadly in the actions and attitudes of the target audience. This arena presents a challenging, fluid problem whose measured data is comprised of large volumes of human-and machinegenerated multimedia content (7), many hybrid interactions within a social media network (8) , and actions or consequences resulting from the IO campaign (9) . These characteristics of modern IO can be addressed by recent advances in machine learning in several relevant fields: natural language processing (NLP), semi-supervised learning, and network causal inference.",

First, potentially relevant social media content is collected using the Twitter public application programming interface (API) based on keywords, accounts, languages, and spatiotemporal ranges. Second, distinct narratives are identified using topic modeling, from Narrative Detection. Narratives are automatically generated from the targeted Twitter data using a topic modeling algorithm (13) . First, accounts whose tweets contain keywords relevant to the subject, or exhibit pre-defined, heuristic behavioral patterns within a relevant time period are identified. Second, content from these accounts are passed to a topic modeling algorithm, and all topics are represented by a collection, or bag of words. Third, interesting topics are identified manually. Fourth, tweets that match these topics above a pre-defined threshold are selected. Fifth, a narrative network is constructed with vertices defined by accounts whose content matches the selected narrative, and edges defined by retweets between these accounts. In the case of the 2017 French elections, the relevant keywords are: 'Macron', 'leaks', 'election', or 'France'; the languages used in topic modeling are English and French. IO Account Classification. IO account classification is performed with a semi-supervised machine-learning approach built using the open source libraries scikit-learn and Snorkel (14, 15) , and soft labeling functions based on heuristics of IO account metadata, content, and behavior. The feature space comprises behaviorial characteristics, profile characteristics, languages used, and the 1-and 2-grams used in tweets; full details are provided in SI:C, and feature importances are illustrated in the 'Results' section in Fig. 4 . The classifier is trained using data from the narrative networks constructed as described in the preceding subsection and using truth from the publicly available Twitter Elections Integrity dataset (7) . Dimensionality reduction and classifier algorithm selection is performed by optimizing precisionrecall performance over a broad set of dimensionality reduction approaches, classifiers, and parameters (see SI:C). In the results section, dimensionality reduction is performed with Extra-Trees (ET) (14) and the classifer is the Random Forest (RF) algorithm (14) . Ensemble tree classifiers learn the complex concepts of IO account behaviors and characteristics without over-fitting to the training data through a collection of decision trees, each representing a simple concept using only a few features.",

The narrative network-a social network of participants involved in discussing and propagating a specific narrativeis constructed from their observed pattern of interactions. In the 'Results' section, narrative networks are constructed using retweets. Narrative networks and their pattern of influence are represented as graphs whose edges represent strength of interactions. The (directed) influence from (account) vertex v i to vertex v j is denoted by the weighted edge a i j . For simplicty in the sequel, network vertex v i is also referred to as i. The influence network is represented by the adjacency matrix A = (a i j ). Because actual influence is not directly observable, the influence network is modeled as a random variable with Poisson distribution parameterized by the observed evidence of influence. Specifically, influence a i j is modeled with distribution a i j \u223c Poisson(\u03bb i j = number of past interactions), as counts of interactive influence in real-world networks (16) . Impact Estimation. Impact estimation is based on a novel method that quantifies each account's unique causal contribution to the overall narrative propagation over the entire network. It accounts for social confounders (e.g. community membership, popularity) and removes their effects from the causal estimation. This approach is based on the network potential outcome framework (17) , itself based upon Rubin's causal framework (18) . Mathematical details are provided in SI:D.",

Targeted collections for several other IO scenarios were also collected during 2017, resulting in a dataset with 782,678,201 tweets and 12,723,995 distinct accounts. Most of these data do not concern the French election, but will provide negative examples for IO classifier training. Narrative Detection. Narratives immediately preceding the election are generated automatically by dividing this broad content into language groups, restricting the content and time period to electionrelated posts within one week preceding the election's media blackout date of 5 May 2017, and filtering accounts based on interaction with non-French media sites pushing narratives expected to harm specific candidates. Topic modeling (13) is applied to the separate English and French language corpora, and the resulting topics are inspected by the authors to identify relevant narratives. Two such narratives are illustrated in Fig. 2 by the most-frequent word and emoji usage appearing in tweets included within the topic. From the English corpus (N = 152,203), 15 topics are generated; from the French (N = 1,070,158), 30 topics.

The classifier is trained using content from three distinct sources: known IO accounts that have tweeted on any topic at least once in either English or French (true examples), and a combination of randomly Precision-Recall (P-R) Performance. P-R performance of the classifier is computed via cross validation using the same dataset with a 90 : 10 split, averaged over 20 rounds (Fig. 3) . Because the number of known cases is limited, weak supervision from the heuristic Snorkel labeling functions is used to identify true examples before cross validation (15) . All training is performed with Snorkel-labeled data, and cross validation is performed both using both Snorkel-labeled data (solid curves in Fig. 3 ) and omitting Snorkel positives (dashed curves). Sensitivity to language-specific training data is also computed by restricting topically relevant, false examples to specific languages. All classifiers exhibit comparably strong performance, and small differences in relative performance is consistent with the authors' expectations. All classifiers detect IO accounts with 96% precision and 79% recall at a nominal operating point, 96% area-under-the-PRcurve (AUPRC), and 8% equal-error rate (EER). The English-only and French-only classifiers perform slightly better (nominally 0-3%) than the combined language model, consistent with the expectation that models with greater specificity outperform less specific models.

Section SI:C lists the behavior, profile features, and language features. Grid search over feature dimensionality is used to identify the best feature set for dimensionality reduction: 10 behavioral and profile features, 30 language features, and 500 1-and 2-grams. The most important features used by the classifier are illustrated by the relative sizes of feature names appearing in the word cloud of Fig. 4 . Note that the most important features for IO account classification are independent of topic, and pertain instead to account behaviorial characteristics and frequency of languages other than English or French. This topic independence suggests the potential applicability of the classifier to other IO narratives. Classifier Performance Comparisons. Several online IO account classifiers exist that are often cited in the press (23), notably Botometer (formerly BotOrNot) (24) and Bot Sentinel (25) . We compare the P-R performance of our IO classifier to both Botometer and Bot Sentinel. This comparison is complicated by three factors: (1) neither Botometer nor Bot Sentinel have published classifier performance against known IO accounts; (2) neither project has posted open source code; and (3) known IO accounts are immediately suspended, which prevents post hoc analysis with these online tools. Therefore, a proxy for known IO accounts must be used for performance comparisons. We use the observation that there exists strong correlation between likely IO accounts in our narrative network and membership in specific, distinguishable communities independently computed using an MCMC-based blockmodel (22) . Community membership of accounts in the French language narrative network ( Fig. 2 ) are illustrated in Fig. 5 . Five distinct communities are detected, three of which are identified to have promoted Macron allegation narratives. The other two narratives promote pro-Macron and pro-abstension narratives. Accounts in this narrative network are classified on a 0-1 scale of their similarity to known IO accounts, shown in Fig. 6 . Comparing Figs. 5 and 6 shows that the great majority of accounts in the 'Macron allegation' communities are classified as highly similar to known IO accounts, and conversely, the great majority of accounts in the pro-Macron and pro-abstention communities are classified as highly dissimilar to known IO accounts. This visual comparison is quantified by the account histogram illustrated in SI Fig. S7 .",

French-language tweets made in the week leading up to the blackout period, 28 April through 5 May 2017, are checked for similarity to the French language topic. To ensure the inclusion of tweets on the #MacronLeaks data dump, which occurred on the eve of the French media blackout, English-language tweets from 29 April through 7 May 2017 are compared to the English topic. In total, the French topic network consists of 6,927 accounts and the Impact Estimation. Estimation on the causal impact of each account in propagating the narrative is performed by computing the estimand in Eq. (1), considering each account as the source. Unlike existing propagation methods on network topology (26) , causal inference accounts also for the observed counts from each account to capture how each source contributes to the subsequent tweets made by other accounts. Results demonstrate this method's advantage over traditional impact statistics based on activity count and network topology alone. Impact estimation and IO classification on the English narrative network (Fig. 2 ) are demonstrated in Fig. 8 . Graph vertices are Twitter accounts sized by the causal impact score (i.e. posterior mean of the causal estimand) and colored by the IO classifier using the same scale as Fig. 6 . Redness indicates account behavior and content like known IO accounts, whereas blueness indicates the opposite. This graph layout reveals two major communities involved in narrative propagation of unsubstantiated financial allegations during the French election. The large community at the top left comprises many accounts whose behavior and content is consistent with known IO accounts. The relatively smaller community at the lower right includes many mainstream media accounts that publish reports on this narrative. Within this mainstream journalism-focused community, the media accounts AP, ABC, RT, and Reuters are among the most impactful, consistent with expectation. The most remarkable result, however, is that known IO accounts are among the most impactful among the large community of IO-like accounts. The existence of these IO accounts was known previously (7, 27), but not their impact in spreading specific IO narratives. Also note the impactful IO accounts (i.e. the large red vertices) in the upper community that appear to target many benign accounts (i.e. the white and blue vertices).",

The prominent @RT_America, a major Russian media outlet, and @JackPosobiec, a widely reported (20) account in spreading this narrative, corroborate our estimate of their very high causal impact scores. This is also consistent with their early participation in this narrative, high tweet counts, high number of followers, and large PageRank centralities. Conversely, @UserA and @UserB have low impact statistics, and also receive low causal impact scores as relatively non-impactful accounts. Known IO account (7-9, 27) @Pamela_Moore13's involvement in this narrative illustrates the relative strength of the causal impact estimates in identifying relevant IO accounts. @Pamela_Moore13 stands out as one of the most prominent accounts spreading this narrative. Yet 'her' other impact statistics (T, RT, F, PR) are not distinctive, and comparable in value to the not-impactful account @UserB. Additionally, known IO accounts @TEN_GOP and @TXCowboys-Rawk (7, 27, 28) , and Sputik writer @CassandraRules (29) all stand out for their relatively high causal impact and IO account classifier scores ( Fig. 9 ). Causal impact estimation is shown to find high-impact accounts that do not stand out using traditional impact statistics. This estimation is accomplished by considering how the narrative propagates over the influence network, and its utility is demonstrated using data from known IO accounts on known IO narratives. Additional impact estimation results are provided in SI:E.",

Such accounts appear in the upper-right side of the scatterplot illustrated in Fig. 9 . Partial validation of this approach is provided by the known IO accounts discussed above. Many other accounts in the upper-right side of Fig. 9 have since been suspended by Twitter, and some at the time of writing are actively spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 coronavirus pandemic (30) . These currently-active accounts participate in IOaligned narratives across multiple geo-political regions and topics, and no matter their authenticity, their content is used hundreds of times by known IO accounts (7) (SI:F). As an effective tool for situational awareness, the framework in this manuscript can alert social media platform providers and the public of influential IO accounts and networks, and the content they spread.",

The framework integrates NLP, machine-learning, graph analytics, and novel network causal inference to quantify the impact of individual actors in spreading the IO narrative. Application of this framework to several authentic influence operation campaigns run during the 2017 French elections provides alerts to likely IO accounts that are influential in spreading IO narratives. Our results are corroborated by independent press reports, U.S. Congressional reports, and Twitter's Elections Integrity public dataset. The detection of IO narratives and high-impact accounts is demonstrated on a dataset comprising 29 million Twitter posts and 1 million accounts collected in 30 days leading up to the 2017 French elections. We also measure and compare the classification performance of a novel semi-supervised classifier for IO accounts involved in spreading specific IO narratives. At a representative operating point, our classifier performs with 96% precision, 79% recall, 96% AUPRC, and 8% EER. Our classifier precision is shown to outperform two online Bot detectors by 20% (nominally) at this operating point, conditioned on a network-community-based truth model. A novel causal network inference approach is used to quantify the impact of accounts spreading specific narratives. This method accounts for the influence network topology and the observed volume from each account, and removes the effects of social confounders (e.g. community membership, popularity). We demonstrate the approach's advantage over traditional impact statistics based on activity count (e.g. tweet and retweet counts) and network topology (e.g. network centralities) alone in discovering high-impact IO accounts that are independently corroborated.

            "text": "B. Narrative Detection Using Topic Modeling. Tweets were collected that are potentially relevant to a representative scenario in which actual IO accounts were expected to be active: the 2017 French election. A large dataset containing both English and French language corpora was created from this collection. From these corpora, 15 English language topics and 30 French topics are generated automatically using a topic modeling algorithm (24) . The set of generated English topics includes several relevant to the French election as well as topics on U.S. politics and other world events. A selection of the English topics is shown in Table S1. The first topic relates to unsubstantiated financial allegations; this is the topic used for network discovery in the main paper. The generated French topics are predominantly focused on the French election, including a French language version of unsubstantiated financial allegations. A subset of these topics is shown in Table S2 . Note that in both tables and the sequel, the notation ':emoji_symbol:' specifies an emoji symbol. (25) is employed. In this approach, training data from known truth are augmented with weakly labeled training data provided by heuristic 'labeling functions' (Table S3) , and the learning model learns and incorporates labeling function inaccuracies. Our Snorkel labeling functions are based on reported characteristics of IO account behavior, content, and metadata (26) (27) (28) (29) . These Snorkel heuristics were then refined by applying them to a small validation set. One hundred accounts were randomly selected out of the 5,000 that tweeted on the French election in English. An attempt was made to label each account as either a real person or an IO account by examining their Twitter profile and current tweets. However, many accounts were either suspended or difficult to determine with confidence to which category they belong. Of these 100 randomly chosen accounts, 24 were labeled as IO accounts, 31 were labeled non-IO, and the remaining were discarded from the validation set. Though 9-15% of all Twitter accounts are estimated to be bots (30) , it is possible that the charged topics analyzed in the main paper contain a higher proportion of bots and possible IO accounts. To account for this possibility in classifier training, all accounts that have a 70% or higher likelihood of being IO-like, according to Snorkel, are labeled as IO accounts, and accounts below the 70% threshold are labeled as non-IO accounts. This results in roughly 30% of the training accounts on the French election and 15% of the topic-neutral accounts being labeled IO accounts. The proportions of each training data subset that falls above the threshold is given for three different points in Table S4 .",

The performance of the all classifier design combinations over a grid of classifier parameters is evaluated via averaged cross validation over twenty 90 : 10 splits. Cross validation is performed both over 10% of all training data (Fig. S2) and after discarding all accounts that were labeled as IO-like by Snorkel heuristics (Fig. S1 ). Of the eight combinations and for both methods of cross validation, the best performing method is composed of dimensionality reduction using the Extra Trees method followed by a Random Forest classifier (Figs. S1, S2). We compare the P-R and ROC curves for Random Forest, Extra Trees across the two methods of cross validation in Figs. S3 and S4, respectively. The standard deviation from cross-validation is shown in Fig. S3 , in which it is seen that the maximum standard deviation for when all data is used is 1.6%, and 3.2% when Snorkel positives are omitted. Although xgBoost with Extra Trees performs as well as the Random Forest, Extra Trees classifier when the validation set includes 10% of all training data, it performs significantly worse when the Snorkel-labeled IO accounts are discarded from the validation set. Further, examination of the performance of xgBoost, Extra Trees on accounts in the narrative networks shows that the classifier scores tend to be skewed towards extremes, rather than being distributed more evenly across the interval [0, 1] (Fig. S6 ).",

A Snorkel score is computed for each account, and in the main paper, all accounts that exceed a score of 70% are treated as IO truth within classifier training. This 70% threshold is determined by both a sensitivity analysis that compares classifier performance across a range of metrics: precision-recall (P-R) at a fixed classifier score threshold (0.6 based on Fig. S7) , area-under-the-PR-curve (AUPRC), the equal-error rate (EER , Table S5 ), and the fraction of training accounts that are labeled positively by Snorkel (Table S4) . Performance is comparable across the three bracketed thresholds considered-50%, 70%, and 90%-though the 50% threshold has the worst performance for most of the statistics. Retaining all training data within cross-validation sets (contra omitting Snorkel positives) is most consistent with the objective of measuring classifier performance on actual accounts within a narrative network. The relative performance comparisons of Table S5 (using all data) and Table S4 show that a 70% threshold has the best AUPRC, best recall, with a small (0.5-1.5%) trade-off in EER and precision, and also the fraction of IO accounts at this threshold is consistent with published estimates of bot activity as discussed in C.1. C.4. Feature Engineering. The IO classifier is trained on three categories of features: account behavior, languages used in tweets, and all 1and 2-grams that appear more than 15 times across all account tweets in the training set. Initially, the feature set is composed of 17 behavioral features, 60 language features, and 1.8 million 1-and 2-grams. To limit the per account content used to generate these content features, a maximum of 10,000 randomly selected tweets are chosen from each account. The total number of tweets used in the English and French classifier is 40,155,545.",

Its optimality is further justified upon examination of the distribution of the classifier scores across accounts in the French narrative network (Fig. S5 ). The accounts are divided by current (March 2020) status as reported by the Twitter API: active, suspended, and deleted. The suspended and deleted accounts are skewed toward higher classifier scores, showing a correlation between accounts detected by the classifier and behavior that results in suspension from Twitter.",

Network potential outcomes are the fundamental quantity used to capture various types of causal effects such as network impact in Eq. [1] of the main paper. Realistically, many network potential outcomes will be unobserved and a complete randomization over the different treatment exposures is infeasible, making the estimation of the causal estimands challenging. Bayesian imputation of the missing network potential outcomes provides a natural conceptual solution. Theory for this imputation is developed based on the critical assumptions of unconfounded treatment assignment and an unconfounded influence network, leading to the key ignorability condition for the treatment exposure mechanism. Driven by this theory, a rigorous design and analysis procedure is proposed for causal inference under network interference.",

More recent work detects and estimates interference effects on networks, many of them building on the potential outcome framework (54) . To detect network interference effects, Bowers et al. (55) propose hypothesis testings using potential outcome models with specific primary and peer effects, and Athey et al. (56) propose exact p-value tests by constructing artificial experiments on the original experimental units such that the null hypothesis is sharp. To estimate network interference effects, Aronow and Samii (57) propose inverse probability weighting when the probability of the specific exposure condition can be computed, Ugander et al. (58) develop a cluster randomization approach that leads to a closed-form solution on the probabilities of specific neighborhood exposures, and Sussman and Airoldi (59) propose exclusion restrictions on the potential outcomes and derive design conditions that lead to unbiased estimators. Social confounders present another source of challenge for causal inference under network interference. Early work by Manski (51) demonstrates unidentifiability of the peer effects in the presence of social confounders under linear outcome models. Recent works in causal inference show that confounding social covariates lead to unidentifiability and biased estimates of causal effects (60), especially on social networks (61, 62) , and how longitudinal studies (63, 64) and design of experiment for specific peer effects (65) provide a way forward.",

Under SUTVA, the potential outcomes for each unit i are a function of its own treatment and are denoted as Y i (Z i ), where Z i is a binary indicator for whether the treatment is assigned to unit i. The potential outcomes of all N units in an experiment, Y , can be partitioned into two vectors of N components: Y (0) for all outcomes under control and Y (1) for all outcomes under treatment. Y can also be partitioned according to whether it is observed. In an experiment, a unit is either under control or under treatment. Therefore, half of all potential outcomes are observed, denoted as Y obs . The other half of the potential outcomes are unobserved, denoted as Y mis . As a result, causal inference is fundamentally a missing data problem, with a rich body of work on rigorous design and analysis for estimating and imputing the missing outcomes (67) .",

Assumption 1 holds under such treatment assignment strategies because the treatment Z only depends on the influence network, A, and relevant unit covariates X.

Activity level and group memberships are examples of such characteristics. For example, an account's node degree on the retweet network may be positively correlated with its potential outcomes (i.e. tweet count on the IO narrative) because hubs in the influence network may tweet more in general. Similarly, an account's membership to an IO community may be positively correlated with its potential outcomes.

Most if not all of the currently well-known network models in the network inference community can be described in this way, including the latent space models (71) , the latent class models such as the membership blockmodels (72) (73) (74) , degree distribution models (75, 76) , and the graphon (77) .

            "text": "E. Impact Estimation on the #MacronLeaks Narrative. Further support of this framework's efficacy is provided by its application to a well-known, highly visible, and distinctive IO narrative network defined by a simple Twitter hashtag, #MacronLeaks (35, 38) (Fig. S8 ). Vertex color in Fig. S8 indicates the number of times each account tweets the hashtag #MacronLeaks; vertex size is the in-degree, i.e. the number of retweets received by each account. Compared to the financial allegation narrative detected via topic modeling in the main paper, this narrative is on a related but more focused event of the leaking of candidate Macron's emails. While many IO narratives do not align nicely with a hashtag and need to be detected via topic modeling, the #MacronLeaks narrative is an instance where the hashtag became a prominent signature for the narrative. The hashtag was widely used in many tweets and retweets, as reflected by the higher magnitude impact statistics in Table S13 , compared to Table 1 in the main paper. Among the accounts with high estimated impact, there exists independent confirmation of the prominence of the two accounts @wikileaks and @JackPosobiec in pushing the #MacronLeaks narrative (35) . The relatively high causal impact of these accounts shown in Table S13 is consistent with independently reported articles about this narrative. Further, a new finding is the high-impact spreading of this IO narrative by the known IO account @Pamela_Moore13 (36, 37) . Comparison between impact statistics in Table S13 highlights the advantage of causal impact estimation in quantifying impact over activityand topologically based statistics such as retweet (RT) volume and PageRank centrality (79, 80) . The limitation of activity count statistics as indicators for impact is seen in @UserA and @UserC, both having high tweet and retweet counts but little impact due to their positions on and connectivities to the network with low centrality. Follower count and PageRank centrality clearly highlight @wikileaks's impact on the network, which is consistent with its high causal impact. However, accounts such as @JackPosobiec, @UserB, and known IO account @Pamela_Moore13 have only a medium level of PageRank centrality, but high causal impact. @JackPosobiec, being one of the earliest participant, has been reported as a key source in pushing the #MacronLeaks narrative (35) . @UserB serves as a bridge into the predominantly French-speaking subgraph (the cluster seen in the middle of Fig. S8) . Causal impact is able to detect these prominent accounts that do not stand out in other impact statistics by modeling the narrative propagation on the network. Unlike existing propagation methods on network topology (81) alone, causal inference accounts also for the observed outcomes at each node.",

            "text": "F. Influential IO-like Content 2017 vs. 2020. Many of the high-impact accounts with behaviors and content similar to known IO accounts (upper-right corner of main paper Fig. 9 ) have been suspended by Twitter since 2017. However, several remain actively engaged at the time of writing in narratives also used by IO accounts in 2020 (12, 82, 83) . For example, high-impact, IO-like accounts that posted on the 2017 French election narrative network (main paper Figs. 2, 6) are actively posting three years later on COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Additional validation of this paper's approach is suggested by examining how the content of such active accounts has been used by known IO accounts. Inspecting a small-but-representative sample of 3 active accounts appearing in the upper-right corner of Fig. 9 of the main paper shows that content from these accounts has been used by known IO accounts hundreds of times (9 in one case, 472 in another, and 589 in another) for each of these active accounts (37) . Furthermore, we observe that our classifier is robust to whether or not these accounts are directly retweeted by known IO accounts. Only 5 tweets from these 3 representative accounts (1, 1, and 3 tweets for each account) were included in our classifier as 'positive' examples used by known IO accounts, whereas 555 tweets (total for all 3) were retweeted by accounts included as negative examples in the training data. Because the classifier training data is comprised of 40 million tweets, the presence of 5 tweets from these specific accounts does not have a large effect on their positive classification, especially that their content appears 555 times in non-IO 'negative' training data. Finally, note that we do not assert or imply that these are IO accounts, but merely observe that their content and behavior is quantifiably similar to known IO accounts, independent of their authenticity. This observation is consistent with the fact that content from these specific accounts has also been used hundreds of times (as retweets) by known IO accounts (37, 84) . ensemble  macron  pen  france  voter  2017ledebat  veux  vote  marine  macron  pen  macron  projet  tour  lepen  europe  appelle  d\u00e9bat  r\u00e9publique  m\u00e9lenchon  programme  pays  faire  2017led\u00e9bat  national  france  euro  fran\u00e7ais  insoumis  mlp  mai  blanc  debat2017  jevotemacron  abstention  mme  politique  mai  projet  macrondirect  marine  soir  libert\u00e9  lepen  jevotemacron  :france:  faut  jamais  porte  emmanuel  france  macronpresident  1er  madame  2017led\u00e9bat twitter.com faire jt20h dimanche twitter.com ",
