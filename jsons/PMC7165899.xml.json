A number of studies reported that bats, especially from southern China, carried a variety of viruses (Chu, Poon, Guan, & Peiris, 2008; Ge et al., 2011, 2012, 2016; Hu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2014). However, so far, few studies have been conducted on bats in northern China, which harbours a diversity of endemic insectivorous bats. To ascertain the prevalence and diversity of viruses circulating in bats in northern China, insectivorous bat representing six species were collected and screened for viruses belonging to six families including coronaviruses, astroviruses, hantaviruses, paramyxoviruses, adenoviruses and circoviruses.",

However, some bat astroviruses detected in this study clustered with porcine/murine/rat astroviruses, implying cross\u2010species transmission between different mammalian hosts. Several studies also showed the existence of cross\u2010species transmission among mamastroviruses. For example, some turkey flocks had antibody against chicken astroviruses (Baxendale & Mebatsion, 2004), several astroviruses isolated from brown rats were most closely related to human astrovirus MLB1 (Chu et al., 2010) and bat astroviruses were phylogenetically related to astroviruses of mink, ovine and human (Xiao et al., 2011).",
