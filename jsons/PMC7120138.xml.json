SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse such diseases based on a mathematical model. After an outbreak of SARS, the first SIR model of SARS was published and many researchers studied the epidemic of the disease using this model. When an outbreak of a new type of influenza is first reported, the U.S. government immediately starts an emergency action plan to estimate parameters of its SIR model. Nevertheless the SIR model has difficulty to analyse which measures are effective because the model has only one parameter to represent infectiveness. For example, it is difficult for the SIR model to evaluate the effect of temporary closing of classes because of the influenza epidemic. The agent-based approach or the individual-based approach has been adopted to conquer these problems in recent years [1\u20134]. The model enables to represent behaviour of each person. It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model.",

What we want to know is how to prevent an epidemic of infectious diseases not only using mechanisms of the epidemic but also decision making of health policy [5]. Most Importantly, we should make a decision in our modern society where people are on the move frequently world wide, so we can minimise the economic and human loss caused by the epidemic. Therefore we developed a new serious game in which authorities of areas or countries need to make a prompt decision regarding health policies such as vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of medical staff in order to achieve effective control measures. In the game, decision-makers need to focus on many kinds of policy variables and control them in an appropriate manner to minimise human loss. Policies have inevitable costs to operate them. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to control an epidemic in a single country in the modern world; therefore cooperation between countries is tantamount. We developed a health policy game designed as a serious game against a new type of infectious disease. Through this game, we aim to analyse how complex decision-making of policies are, and confirm the effectiveness as an educational tool of policy decision-making.",

Vaccine and antiviral medicine for the disease are already developed and provided to the market in this model. Players as authorities of two countries decide the amount of both medicines stocks according to their restricted budget. They also need to decide the number of medical staff, blockade and restrictions on outings. The players should consider giving support medicine and staff to countries to prevent or control its epidemic for his/her own country, while taking account of economic cost and loss. Travel restrictions have a huge economic impact, while it is very effective in stopping an outbreak. Supporting to another country means decreasing its own preparations.
