Infection results in the development of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) (WHO 2020). EMS providers are potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 while providing patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet data concerning Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers and COVID19 is scarce. A search of NCBI using the terms \"EMS AND COVID-19\" returned no articles. Response to COVID-19 in the pre-hospital setting is currently guided by the Interim Guidance for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems and 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for COVID-19 in the United States. (CDC 2020). This study aimed to investigate individual EMS provider competency and resource accessibility amid COVID-19 in the United States using a self-report survey questionnaire. Limitations for this study include a limited sample size and the consideration that no current model for this type of questioning exists.",

The survey also featured a COVID-19 opinions section. Between April 1, 2020 and April 16, 2020 the survey was randomly distributed to various active Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel in all 50 U.S. states including the District of Columbia (n=192) by way of multi-organizational distribution and promotion, press release, and social media distribution. An ethics approval was obtained and certified by the Institutional Review Board. The public or participants of this study were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of research. Based on available U.S. Census data for EMS professionals, we approximate a 95% confidence interval with a marginal error of \u00b1 0.07 to reflect representation of practicing providers in the United States. Table 1 , the majority of survey respondents were EMT-Basics. However, the training level of respondents ranged from EMR to Paramedic. Most respondents reported that their education consisted of a high school diploma or GED. The minority of respondents reporting the earning of a graduate degree. The working environment of providers was reported to be mostly suburban. Figure 1 reflects respondent distribution by U.S. state. As reflected in Table 2 , early all EMS providers reported access to medical gloves when needed, with nitrile gloves being the most common gloves used in the pre-hospital setting. 48% of providers reported having access to N95 masks when needed. Of those who had access to N95 masks, 31% reported having to use the mask for 1 week or greater and 16% reported injury due to excessive PPE wear.",

The preliminary data suggests, however, that providers may benefit from improved standardized training in pandemic response, specifically with regard to clinical symptomatology recognition, origins of the disease, a uniformed decontamination protocol, pandemic-specific inventory inservice, and stricter regulations and enforcement on decontamination of personal items, such as stethoscopes. The employment of disposable stethoscopes for EMS providers may also prove beneficial in reducing spread of infection. The data also warrants investigation on the efficacy of currently practiced decontamination procedures, as well as the presence of pathogenic novel coronavirus on the surface area of EMS equipment.",

Additionally, almost one-third of surveyed providers report being unsure whether a COVID-19 patient is infectious, and more than one-half of participants inaccurately identified a common symptom of COVID-19. Current practices to appropriately educate EMS providers on the novel coronavirus may not be sufficient, and families of providers and future patients may benefit from a nationally established COVID-19 EMS response protocol that complements or supersedes the recommendation of the current Interim Guidance by the CDC. The data reveals concerning deficits in COVID-19 related education and administrative protocols which potentially poses a serious public health concern that should be urgently addressed to reduce the spread of infection.",
