Expressing this differently, one has to tune the algorithms which is requiring domain knowledge and a larger amount of experience. Furthermore, it may be expensive, error prune and time consuming to arrive at a suitable tuning. However, as a radically different approach, the paradigm of parameter-free data mining has emerged (cf. Keogh et al. [11] ). The main idea of parameterfree data mining is the design of algorithms that have no parameters and that are universally applicable in all areas.",

Our data are gene sequences for the hemagglutinin of influenza viruses. The hemagglutinin of influenza viruses is important, since it is responsible for binding the virus to the cell it infects. So far, 16 subtypes of influenza hemagglutinin are known. More details are given in Subsection 3.1. The definite method used by biologists to determine the subtype of the influenza hemagglutinin is based on the antiserum that prevent the docking of the virus. So intuitively, the similarity between the gene sequences for the hemagglutinin of influenza viruses should be large if they have the same subtype and small if the have a different subtype. Therefore, it seems justified to test the paradigm of parameter-free data mining in this domain.",

In order to achieve this goal with collected from each subtype up to 8 examples. The reason for choosing at most 8 sequences from each type has been caused by their availability. While for some subtypes there are many sequences, there are also subtypes for which only very few sequences are available. The extreme case is the subtype H16 for which only one sequence is in the data base. Figure 2 shows the number of sequences chosen.",
