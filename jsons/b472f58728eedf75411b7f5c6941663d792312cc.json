Conventional HIV diagnostic assays are based on an enzyme assay (EIA/ELISA) followed by western blot and requires trained laboratory personnel. Universal access to HIV diagnostics is stymied by the lack of trained technicians, patient motivation, and laboratory access especially in rural areas and the developing world. For instance, about 83% of HIV patients remain undiagnosed in Kenya ( 102 ) . Thus, a simple, inexpensive diagnostic tool for HIV would be readily welcomed. The number of CD4 + T-lymphocytes per microliter of HIV-infected blood is a critical monitor of disease state and this measurement is needed to make informed antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment decisions. Therefore, the primary mechanisms for HIV detection in POC micro fl uidic devices are enumeration of CD4 + T-lymphocytes and HIV viral load quanti fi cation. To be successful, the POC device needs to detect around 200 CD4 + cells/ \u03bc L and 400 copies/mL of HIV from whole blood ( 103 ) . Towards this goal, Sia et al . reported a micro fl uidic immunoassay, \"POCKET (portable and cost-effective)\" for quantifying anti-HIV-1 antibodies in the sera of HIV-1 infected patients. The device consisted of a PDMS slab with microchannels placed orthogonally to a polystyrene stripe patterned with HIV-enveloped antigen. The HIV-1 infected patient serum sample is fl owed through the microchannels to quantify anti-HIV-1 antibodies. Although the device was able to identify the sera of HIV-1-infected patients from those of non-infected patients, it could not make a correlation of the output data with HIV disease states ( 103 ) . Lee et al . developed a RT-PCR-based POC diagnostic chip for HIV. The chip relies on HIV markers p24 (a major core protein encoded by the HIV gag gene) and gp120 (an external envelope protein encoded by envelope gene) for diagnostic purposes ( 104 ) . Cheng et al . reported a POC micro fl uidic CD4 + T-cell counting device. The device works in two stages, initial depletion of monocytes from whole blood and subsequent CD4 + T cell capture. The strategy of contaminant (monocytes) depletion prior to CD4 + T cell isolation enhances the performance in low CD4 count (200 cells/ \u03bc L) scenarios ( 105 ) . Other label-free CD4 + T-lymphocyte capture techniques have been reported. Although the micro fl uidic devices themselves are disposable and usually cheap, they still require expensive optical microscopes to count the captured CD4 + T-cells ( 106, 107 ) . A lensless portable CCD-based micro fl uidic platform developed by Demirci et al . overcomes this limitation. The captured label-free CD4 + T-lymphocytes are detected by a charge coupled device (CCD) sensor using lensless shadow imaging techniques and counted using automatic cell counting software in a few seconds ( 108 ) .

The lack of success is not due to problems with micro fl uidic devices; for example, drug screening requires high-throughput methods to fi nd and test different drug candidates. Micro fl uidic high-throughput screening (HTS) techniques have been applied to drug discovery to perform thousands of tests in parallel with some success (162) (163) (164) . As of now these methods haven't been applied in micro fl uidic diagnostics for several reasons. Current diagnostics are typically performed in large hospitals or reference labs. In these labs, most tests are Cardiac STATus\u2122 Not reported ( 142 ) batched and performed using robots in a highly parallel, high throughput approach. Replacing these robots by using micro fl uidics is unlikely in the short term due to the large infrastructure already developed. Essentially, a solution to this problem already exists, so adoption of micro fl uidics for these assays will only occur if there are compelling assay improvements. In addition, if an assay can be performed in a batch mode using micro fl uidics, it is likely to be able to be performed in the clinic or POC setting, and for nearly the same price. Thus, micro fl uidics is likely to be driven to the POC rather than to large reference laboratories. The reverse of high-throughput screening (multiple samples with one target) is multiplexed screening, where one sample is tested for multiple agents or biomarkers. A few examples of multiplexed screening have already been provided, especially for cardiac biomarkers, but highly multiplexed diagnostics are still being developed. Multiplexed screening is likely to have a more signi fi cant impact on diagnostics than high throughput screening, especially with the move towards personalized medicine. Micro fl uidics has been combined with microarray technology, which is used regularly in genomics and proteomics, and which will likely have diagnostic applications in the future; however, this is beyond the scope of the chapter. More relevant are micro fl uidic devices that can diagnose multiple diseases simultaneously. A recently released product that uses \"mesoscale\" fl uidics can simultaneously diagnose 15 respiratory diseases associated with viruses ( 165 ) . A challenge with getting the device to commercialization is that regulatory agencies such as the FDA require individual validation of each assay, meaning that multiplexing must clear very challenging regulatory requirements, which will likely limit substantial multiplexing in the near future. Nevertheless, micro fl uidics will probably lead to highly multiplexed assays that can perform 100s or 1,000s of diagnostic assays on one sample. About 1,200 patents related to micro fl uidics have been issued in the USA through 2010. In spite of immense academic interest in micro fl uidics and signi fi cant research investment directed towards both academic and industrial organizations, relatively few commercial products based on micro fl uidics have been introduced into the market ( 166, 167 ) ; however, the rate of introduction is increasing and many barriers are coming down. One of the reasons cited for lack of commercial success is the lack of a potential \"blockbuster\" end-user product that could generate billions of dollars in revenue. Until the industry can fi nd a product with high volume demand, the fabrication costs due to lack of \"economies of scale\" are going to remain high.

Table 4 provides a sample of micro fl uidic companies and products in the market. More comprehensive lists are available ( 169 ) . Micro fl uidic diagnostic devices have been developing at a rapid rate over the past few years. While the potential for these devices was fi rst recognized more than 20 years ago, the realization of that potential has been slow, even though thousands of devices and methods have been published. The continuing development of applications and micro fl uidic manufacturing methods, including platform technologies that can be customized easily for each diagnostic test, will be the drivers of success. Very recent progress and an emphasis on global health has helped move the fi eld towards POC devices that will likely become ubiquitous in the years ahead. While most micro fl uidic devices have one diagnostic target, devices capable of diagnosing 100s or 1,000s of diseases will likely be developed and commercialized in the next decade, making micro fl uidics a major driver of disease diagnostics.
