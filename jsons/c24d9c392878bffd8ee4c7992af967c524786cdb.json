This approach is novel in a way that combines methods of different types and adds edit distance based corrections.",

Furthermore, some characters cannot accept any diacritics at all (ex: ), and some others cannot do that in specified grammatical contexts (ex: the definitive at the beginning of the word). The diacritics are essential to indicate the correct pronunciation and the meaning of the word. They are all presented on the letter in Table 1 . These marks are dropped from almost all the written text today, except the documents intolerant to pronunciation errors, such as religious texts and Arabic teaching materials.

To generate the word pattern, the following substitutions are applied: are all replaced by . is replaced by . The rest of the Arabic characters except and the long vowels ( ) are substituted by the character . The diacritics and the other characters are not affected. The predicted diacritized pattern is compared to the saved diacritization forms of this pattern when available, and the closest one, according to the Levenshtein distance, is used as a correction, following the same idea of the previous stage. This correction is effective when the test data contains many words not seen in the training data.",
