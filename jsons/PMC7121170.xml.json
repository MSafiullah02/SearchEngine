VT detected in the stools of children with HUS (free fecal VT) and lysates from VT producing E. coli (VTEC) [18] were neutralized by convalescent patient and rabbit immune sera [2, 17]. In the same year, Dr. Allison O\u2019Brien from the Armed Services, Bethesda, recognized that a toxin, elaborated by a newly described E. coli strain (E. coli O157:H7), bore close similarity with the toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Shiga toxin) which she termed Shiga-like toxin (SLT) [19]. The prototypic disease caused by E. coli O157:H7 became known as hemorrhagic colitis [20\u201323] and the organism was termed \u201centerohemorrhagic E. coli\u201d or EHEC. Subsequent work by Karmali, O\u2019Brien, Karch and others showed that verotoxin, SLT and the classic Shiga toxin belonged to a family of closely-related bacterial protein exotoxins with the major subdivisions of SLT-I or VT1, now termed Stx1, and SLT-II or VT2, now termed Stx2 (and variants) [24] as outlined in Table 26.1. We will use the terms STEC-HUS, Stx-HUS or enteropathogenic HUS (eHUS) to describe patients with the \u201ctypical\u201d or \u201cclassical\u201d form of HUS.\n",

EHEC (enterohemorrhagic E. coli) are defined by the disease they induce in humans, bloody (hemorrhagic) colitis [45].

Per definition, all STEC strains have the potential to produce Stx. However, STEC serotypes and clones variably express additional pathogenic factors that mediate bacterial adherence in the gut and in vivo toxin production and delivery [114]. Deadly outbreaks by other non-O157 STEC strains have been reported, and the large E. coli O104:H4 epidemic in Northern Germany in 2011 was a powerful reminder that non-O157:H7 Stx producing E. coli, when introduced into widely distributed food items, can have devastating consequences.",

A study from Germany estimated that E. coli O157:H7 imparts overall an approximately tenfold greater HUS risk compared with non-O157 STEC strains (<1 % versus 8\u201315 %) [116]. Nevertheless, there is substantial variation in the HUS risk according to the infecting (non-O157) STEC clone. In the cited US-based, CDC analysis [109] a greater percentage of persons infected by Stx2-positive non-O157:H7 STEC developed HUS compared with persons infected by Stx1-only producing strains (7 % vs. 0.8 %; P < 0\u00b7001) [109]. Infections by the emerging, highly pathogenic, Stx2-producing E. coli O26:NM/H11 [93, 117, 118] and, in particular, by the sorbitol-fermenting (SF) non-motile E. coli O157 clone [119], carry high case fatality rates between 11 % and 50 % [88, 120]. No animal reservoir has been identified for the \u201cGerman\u201d E. coli SF O157:NM strain, which has also been isolated from HUS patients in the Czech Republic and Finland [88, 121, 122].",

It is found on microvascular endothelial cells (including glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium), glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes), platelets and germinal center B-lymphocytes [219], and peripheral and central neurons [220, 221]. Only the efficient transport to the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent rRNA depurination result in cell toxicity. Platelets, and possibly red blood cells (RBCs), can bind Stx (and LPS) [208, 209, 222, 223]. Newer ex vivo studies suggest a link between platelet Stx binding, complement activation and microparticle-induced endothelial injury and microvascular thrombosis in patients with eHUS [223\u2013225].",

The A subunit is nicked by the intracellular protease furin [241] and is chaperoned to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the disulfide bond linking the A1 and A2 fragments is reduced. Stx endocytosis and transport to the Golgi apparatus are facilitated by various second messenger (phosphorylation) events that include Stx-induced tyrosine kinases as well as remodeling of cytoskeleton components [198, 242]. The processed A1 fragment then cleaves a specific adenine residue from the 3\u2032 region of the 28S rRNA of the mammalian 60S ribosomal subunit of actively translating ribosomes. Loss of the adenine residue causes a conformational change of the ribosomal RNA resulting in the effective inhibition of protein biosynthesis in toxin-sensitive cells [243] (Fig. 26.4). Very few molecules are needed to paralyze the cell making it one of the most potent known toxins.\n",

The observed biological effects are tissue dependent. For example, bovine intestinal epithelial cells express Gb3 but are insensitive to Shiga cytotoxicity, possibly due to their sorting of the toxin to lysosomes instead of the endoplasmic reticulum [254]. Other tissues that are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effect of Stx may still respond with an \u201cactivated\u201d phenotype [255\u2013258].

Stx (and LPS) interact with platelets, monocytes and neutrophils, and possibly RBCs and plasma proteins (serum amyloid proteins) or glycolipids [205, 223, 225, 272\u2013279]. There is little evidence that Stx modulates neutrophil or monocyte function under in vivo conditions [280\u2013284]. The previously postulated \u201ctransfer\u201d of toxin from low affinity receptors on circulating leukocytes to high affinity receptors on small vessel endothelial cells [274, 285, 286] may be (too) simplistic [279, 287]. However, investigators have demonstrated more recently that Stx (and LPS) induce the formation of platelet and monocyte microparticles loaded with tissue factor and complement [223, 288]. Biologically active microparticles and (direct) Stx-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells, including the externalization of plasma membrane phosphatidylserine [289], may provide a mechanism how localized (colon) or systemic microvascular thrombosis is initiated in the gut and kidney [290]. Endothelial cell injury or activation may induce or modulate vasoactive mediators, including chemokines and their receptors [255, 258, 259, 290\u2013294] which would then result in a prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive endothelial phenotype known as thrombotic microangiopathy.",

The SOS response is initiated when damaged bacterial DNA binds and activates the (bacterial) RecA protein. Activated RecA induces the degradation (cleavage) of key repressor molecules, LexA and CI, leading to the temporary arrest of DNA synthesis, cell division and error-prone DNA repair. Cleavage of the CI phage repressor/activator protein results in the coordinately regulated induction and expression of previously silent phage encoded genes (including Stx A and B subunit genes), the production of phage particles, and bacterial cell lysis [330, 340, 345]. Experiments in mice infected with RecA mutated STEC strains [341] have demonstrated the importance of the bacterial SOS system under in vivo conditions.",

Prior to the use of Shiga toxin assays and PCR, the isolation of non-O157:H7 STEC strains among commensal gut flora by traditional microbiological techniques was laborious, which contributed to the delayed appreciation of non-O157:H7 STEC clones as a cause of enterocolitis and HUS. Another potential barrier to the efficient isolation of non-O157:H7 STEC strains are variable toxin production and instability or loss of toxin producing phages. The latter phenomenon was first noted in subcultures of STEC isolates, but was subsequently shown to occur in vivo as well [84, 326]. In fact, the gut appears to be a veritable hot bed for the exchange of phage material and other mobile genetic elements [325, 356].",

STEC isolation and free fecal toxin detection rates diminish soon after the onset of HUS [115, 150, 151]. If stool culture or toxin assay(s) are delayed or negative, serological assays can be employed to search for elevated (or rising) IgM class antibodies to one of the more common STEC O-groups (LPS antigens) by ELISA, hemagglutination assay or Western blot [150, 222, 363\u2013366]. Saliva IgA (and IgM) provide a suitable alternative to serum antibodies [366\u2013368]. Testing for serum antibodies to Stx has been used as an epidemiological tool [97, 369], but its diagnostic utility in the clinical setting is limited [142]. Additional STEC-expressed or secreted proteins may elicit an antibody response [370], but are rarely used diagnostically. Serological tests are generally offered in reference laboratories (Table 26.3).\n",

Relying on a clinical diagnosis (\u201cD+ HUS\u201d) and omission of microbiological testing is inadequate. A prerequisite for the correct microbiological diagnosis is the dialogue with the microbiologist. The diagnostic workup should not be limited to free Stx [377]. Where available, stool samples should be screened (by PCR) for Stx genes and/or specific STEC \u201cvirulence\u201d-associated genes. In the absence of microbiological evidence of STEC, serological testing for serum or saliva IgM or IgA antibodies against defined O-group (LPS) antigens or other virulence proteins may aid in the diagnosis. Although new and more sensitive diagnostic techniques continue to be developed, a combination of methods will still be necessary for optimal yield [353, 378, 379].",

Hemolysis is accompanied by a rapid fall of platelet numbers, usually <50, at times <30 \u00d7 109/L. Direct and indirect Coombs (anti-globulin) tests are negative. Rising indirect bilirubin, free plasma hemoglobin and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (the latter often more than five times the upper normal), and haptoglobin depletion are consistent with a rapid hemolytic process. The peripheral white blood cell (neutrophil) count, already increased during the colitis phase, may continue to rise and, if associated with a leukemoid reaction, can herald a severe course with poor intestinal or renal outcome [68, 308, 410]. The severity of anemia and thrombocytopenia does not correlate with the degree of acute or chronic kidney injury. Some authors noted an inverse relationship between hematocrit (Hb level) and disease severity [410, 411]. A plausible explanation for the latter observation is the hemoconcentration seen in patients with intravascular volume depletion during the first 4 days of STEC colitis [402, 410]. A retrospective study of 137 children with STEC-HUS from Argentina, performed to determine whether dehydration at admission is associated with an increased need for dialysis, indeed showed that \u201cdehydrated\u201d children had a higher rate of vomiting and an increased risk of being dialysed than normovolemic children (70.6 versus 40.7 %, P = 0.0007) [412].",

Signs and symptoms can be vague and nonspecific, and are probably underappreciated. Patients may present with irritability, lethargy or decreased level of consciousness; short seizures are relatively common and may reflect fluid and electrolyte imbalances related to AKI and inadequate volume replacement. Abnormal electroencephalograms have been reported in up to 50 % of patients with HUS. Prolonged seizure activity, usually associated with acute respiratory deterioration or palsy, is an ominous sign and may indicate a cerebral stroke or hemorrhage. Acute, transient or persistent (isolated) palsy, dysphasia, diplopia, retinal injury or cortical blindness has been noted [426, 438]. Evident neurological complications or \u201ccatastrophic\u201d events are associated with a poor prognosis [426, 439].

However, the predictive value of MRI findings in STEC-HUS remains to be confirmed [427, 443]. In the acute phase, basal ganglia and white matter abnormalities with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) restriction are a common and reversible MRI finding. They consist characteristically of bilateral hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted imaging and T2-weighted sequences located in the basal ganglia and thalami, and can extend to the white matter [443]; they can be associated with decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images of basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem [427, 428, 443\u2013446] (Fig. 26.6a\u2013f). However, the described changes do not appear to be specific for STEC-HUS and often revert over a period of weeks or months [443]. Images can be variable, with or without ADC decrease due to the presence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or hemodialysis in addition to primary, Stx or STEC-HUS induced lesions [443].\n",

In a retrospective cohort study of 29 unselected children with E. coli O157:H7 HUS, Tarr and his group [402] showed that patients who became oligoanuric and needed dialysis had received significantly less intravenous fluid during the first 4 days of diarrhea than children who had preserved urine output and who were not dialyzed. The authors concluded that early parenteral volume expansion before the onset of HUS attenuates AKI and reduces the need for dialysis. The original findings were reproduced in a prospective multicenter cohort of 50 children with STEC O157:H7 colitis. The treated group received a median volume of 1.7 (0\u20137.5) vs. 0 (0\u20134.9) L/m2 (P = 0.02) and 189 (0\u2013483) vs. 0 (0\u2013755) mmol sodium/m2 surface area (P = 0.05). None of the enrolled patients required ventilatory assistance because of acute pulmonary edema or other volume-related complications [403]. The authors postulated that the oligoanuria of HUS results from renal parenchymal hypoperfusion and ischemia using the analogy of myocardial infarction; and that intravenous volume expansion is an underused intervention that has the potential to decrease the frequency of oligoanuric renal failure in patients at risk of HUS [403]. Support for the \u201cvolume hypothesis\u201d comes from an independent study from Argentina [479] and observations linking higher Hb concentrations at presentation with severe HUS, including neurological complications [405, 411].",

Antibiotic use was further associated with the development of oligoanuric HUS [347, 404]. When authors compared different antibiotic classes, the association with HUS remained significant for cotrimoxazole and metronidazole, but not for betalactams or azithromycin. Antibiotic therapy also failed to shorten the duration of gastrointestinal symptoms [404]. The latter analysis replicated the results of a retrospective case-control study of an institutional outbreak of STEC O157:H7 HUS, where eight residents developed HUS; five of these eight patients had received TMP/SMX compared to none of the seven residents with diarrhea, whose colitis was not complicated by HUS (p = 0.026). As the authors point out, antimicrobial treatment may have been given to patients with more severe illness [70].",

An instructive, prospective cohort study [390] originated from the 1996 outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 infection among school children via contaminated bean sprout in Sakai City, Japan, where antibiotics were used extensively during the diarrhea phase [102]. Children infected with the outbreak strain, who were given fosfomycin within the first 2 days of illness (diarrhea), developed HUS significantly less often than those who did not receive antibiotics (adjusted OR 0.15; CI95 % 0.03\u20130.78). In contrast, fosfomycin started on and after the third day of illness was not associated with HUS prevention [390]. Others suggested a beneficial effect of oral fluoroquinolones compared with IV or PO fosfomycin during the same outbreak [497]. While the latter (retrospective) study has important limitations, it draws attention to the difficulties predicting minimal inhibitory (MIC) and sub-inhibitory concentrations in the (anaerobic) milieu of the gut.",

Controlled, prospective studies with select antimicrobial agents are necessary to resolve this important caveat [508, 509]. Rifaximin and few other agents, such as azithromycin or fosfomycin may be suitable to limit the spread of the organism and, potentially, to reduce the rate of complications during STEC epidemics. Based on the experience during the Sakai outbreak in Japan, the antibiotic should be given immediately, i.e., within 48 h after the onset of diarrhea to be effective [390]. Only agents that do not induce a bacterial SOS response or augment Stx production at any concentration should be used [141, 324, 510]. All other antimicrobial agents should be discontinued after STEC identification if already started [115, 509, 511]. Until additional data become available, caution is advised in prescribing antibiotics empirically to children with bloody diarrhea, except in Shigella dysentereriae endemic regions.",

The investigators hypothesized that the agent, administered orally soon after the diagnosis of HUS, would diminish continued toxin absorption and result in disease amelioration. Primary endpoints were decreased rates of death, serious extrarenal events and dialysis frequency. The trial was stopped when the interim analysis revealed no difference between treatment and placebo groups. Several consideration may explain the negative trial outcome: (a) the binder may not reach the site of toxin production and delivery by STEC that adhere tightly to the mucosa via \u201cattaching and effacing\u201d lesions [566], (b) the binding affinity and capacity may have been insufficient and/or the chosen dose too small, and (c) the timing after HUS onset may have been too late.

            "text": "Reports of decreased plasma C3 concentrations in children with presumed STEC-HUS appeared since the 1970s [584\u2013586]. The first reports predated the recognition of the central role of STEC infection in children with (typical) HUS. Several authors described glomerular deposition of C3 in (kidney) biopsies obtained during the acute phase of HUS [587]. Nonetheless, the majority of eHUS patients demonstrate C3 serum levels within the reference range. The employment of more sensitive assays confirmed the activation of complement in eHUS. For example, Monnens et al. detected elevated levels of breakdown products of the two components of the alternative pathway C3-convertase, C3 (C3b, C3c, C3d) and CFB (Ba) in the serum of children with \u201cpost-diarrhea\u201d HUS [585]. More recently, increased plasma levels of the CFB activation product Bb and the soluble form of the terminal complement complex sC5b-9 were demonstrated in 17 children with acute STEC-HUS that normalized by day 28 of the disease [588]. Comparable results were obtained in a Swedish cohort of 10 children, all of whom displayed elevated C3a and sC5b-9 (terminal complement complex) concentrations in plasma as well as C3 and C9 bearing, mainly platelet-derived microparticles (measured as mean fluorescent intensities) during acute STEC-HUS that normalized with disease recovery [223]. A detailed case study of one patient with acute eHUS by the same authors revealed the presence of C3, Stx2 and LPSO157 on a larger number of platelet-neutrophil and platelet-monocyte complexes (by flow cytometry) compared with healthy controls [223]. The cited findings suggest the recruitment of complement components, together with Stx and bacterial LPS, on the surface of platelets [589] and, to a lesser degree, neutrophils and monocytes, and alternative pathway activation in acute STEC-HUS [223]. Stahl et al. speculated that while complement activation is not the primary event occurring during EHEC infection, it may contribute to blood cell activation and renal injury, through the release of microparticles, free radicals and cytokines. Deposition of the terminal complement complex (TCC or sC5b-9), demonstrated in post-mortem tissue from a child with STEC-HUS (Fig. 26.9a\u2013f) further suggests that complement is activated in this disease.\n",

Endothelial complement deposition and loss of thromboresistance was dependent on Stx-induced P-selectin expression and high-affinity C3 binding and alternative pathway activation [399, 591], and was blocked by a P-selectin antibody and the P-selectin soluble ligand PSGL-1. The findings were reproduced in the authors\u2019 mouse model of HUS induced by the combined injection of Stx2 and LPS [399].

Experimental data indicate that TM expression is decreased in Stx2 exposed human glomerular microvascular endothelial cells that had been sensitized with pro-inflammatory mediators [590]. In the Bergamo mouse model of HUS, induced by the combined injection of Stx2 and LPS, reduced glomerular TM expression was observed in association with fibrin and platelets deposition [399]. Zoja et al. further demonstrated that mutation of the lectin-like TM domain worsened murine Stx-HUS [607]. Mice lacking the lectin-like domain exhibited excess glomerular C3 deposition indicating impaired complement regulation and local generation of complement-derived, pro-inflammatory peptides, such as the chemokines C3a and C5a. Binding of C3a to endothelial cells leads to impaired endothelial thromboresistance and may contribute to the TMA in the authors\u2019 model [399].",

Hypertension was present in 55.6 % of patients with >10 days of anuria versus 8.9 % in those without anuria (OR 12.8; CI95 % 2.9\u201357.5).

Patients with SD1 infection should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Shiga toxin (Stx) is likely involved in the pathogenesis of S. dysenteriae colitis and HUS. The release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during the invasive infection is thought to potentiate the ribotoxic effect of Stx and disease severity [651, 652]. Children with SD1-HUS can demonstrate impressive neutrophilia and left shift [635, 641]. As with STEC-HUS, a high peripheral neutrophil count has been associated with the development and severity of HUS [649, 653]. Some patients manifest the full DIC picture [3, 654]. Although STEC can induce subtle coagulation activation [148], full-blown DIC is not seen in STEC-HUS in the absence of gangrenous or perforating colitis and secondary sepsis or peritonitis.",

However, S. dysenteriae is endemic in areas with limited resources and access to health care, and affected children may be malnourished and suffer from additional morbidities [656].

Thus, exposure of S. dysenteriae type 1 to antibiotics is not expected to increase Stx expression via phage induction. However, bacterial killing by antibiotics and subsequent lysis could augment stool toxin concentrations. In an attempt to estimate the risk of HUS attributable to antibiotic use, investigators at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Dhaka, Bangladesh analyzed a well-defined group of children with SD1 infection who were treated early in the course of illness. Free fecal Stx levels decreased after the administration of antibiotics in 85 % of enrolled children, and none of the studied patients developed HUS [637].",

Neuraminidase cleaves terminal sialyl (N-acetyl neuraminic acid, Neu5Ac) residues from membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids of red and white blood cells, endothelial cells, and other tissues [676\u2013678]. The exposed O-glycan core 1 (Gal \u03b21-3 GalNAc \u03b1-O-) is known as (asialo)glycophorin A [660, 679] or Thomsen-Friedenreich disaccharide (T or TF antigen) [671] (Fig. 26.10). The TF antigen is recognized by the lectin Arachis hypogaea which has been used to detect the in vivo effect of neuraminidase on RBCs and tissues in patients with pnHUS [4, 5, 676] and to titrate circulating neuraminidase activity by exposing control RBCs to serially diluted plasma from patients with pnHUS [680].\n",

The patient was diagnosed with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and graft failure 1\u20132 weeks after the onset of influenza, almost 2 years after transplantation; additional laboratory features included cold agglutinins (with negative direct Coombs test) and transiently reduced plasma C3 concentration.

The holotoxin binds to lipid raft-associated membrane globotriasosyl ceramide (Gb3) and enters the cell via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. A and B subunits become disengaged and the A submit is cleaved and activated by intracellular furin. Upon \u201cretrograde\u201d passage through the Golgi apparatus, the A\u2032 subunit selectively removes a specific adenine residue from the 28S RNA of the large ribosomal subunit (N-glycosidase activity). This results in (1) blockade of active (translating) ribosomes (translational inhibition), and (2) a ribotoxic cellular stress response with activation of c-jun and p38 (MAP) kinases and/or apoptotic cell death (Used with permission of author and Elsevier from Loirat et al.
