            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) includes four genera, alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronavirus, which have been clustered in the Coronavirinae subfamily (de Groot et al., 2011, Reguera et al., 2012). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are pleomorphic, enveloped viruses (Perlman and Netland, 2009). Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a representative CoV in the alphacoronavirus genus; severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-related CoV) is a representative of the betacoronavirus genus; infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a representative of the gammacoronavirus genus; and Bulbul-CoV is a representative of the deltacoronavirus genus (de Groot et al., 2011). TGEV is positive RNA viruses, which is a large family of enveloped virus (Masters, 2006). The infection of TGEV causes severe diarrhea in suckling piglets (about 2 weeks old), which results in enormous economic loss in swine-producing areas in the world (Kim and Chae, 2001, Sestak et al., 1996). TGEV genome (28.5 kb) encodes the replicase gene (rep) at the 5\u2032 end and encodes other viral genes at the 3\u2032 end (5\u2032-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032)(Penzes et al., 2001). TGEV genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), minor envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N).",

EF1A is an abundant G protein that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the elongating ribosome (Carvalho et al., 1984b). EF1A hydrolyzes GTP, dissociates from the aminoacyl-tRNA, and leaves the ribosome (Moldave, 1985). Except a major translation factor, EF1A plays important multifunctional roles in mammalian cells. EF1A Interacts with newly synthesized polypeptides for quality surveillance (Hotokezaka et al., 2002). In ubiquitin-dependent degradation, EF1A interacted with ubiquitinated proteins and is essential for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Chuang et al., 2005, Gonen et al., 1994). EF1A undergoes several post-translational modifications, mainly phosphorylation and methylation, and plays important role in facilitating apoptosis (Lamberti et al., 2004).",

EF1 complex is composed of four different subunits, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta (2:1:1:1) in mammalian cells (Carvalho et al., 1984a). In TGEV infected cells, EF1A may interact with N protein of TGEV that bind to TGEV RNA in a similar manner. Instead of an enzymatic activity, EF1A may provide protein\u2013RNA and protein\u2013protein interactions that promote the assembly of TGEV replication complexes. In this study, the results demonstrate that EF1A can interact with N protein of TGEV. It is possible that EF1A is involved in targeting TGEV N onto intracellular membranes that provide a microenvironment for the efficient replication of the viral RNA. From Fig. 3, we can see that the attenuated strain of TGEV N protein appears to be pulled down much more with EF1A than the wild type N protein in. The reason maybe that attenuated TGEV virus was better to adapt ST cells than infectious TGEV (data not shown).
