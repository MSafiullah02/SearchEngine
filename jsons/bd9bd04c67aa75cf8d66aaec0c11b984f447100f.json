            "text": "Epitranscriptomic marks in the form of RNA modifications are catalyzed by specific enzymes or RNA-protein complexes on the base or ribose sugar of the canonical adenosine, cytosine, guanosine and uridine nucleosides. RNA modifications can include simple changes such as methylation or acetylation, or hyper modifications involving multiple enzymes and cofactors. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the most heavily modified RNA species with an average of 13 RNA modifications comprising ~17% of the 80-90 ribonucleosides. Epitranscriptomic marks can be located throughout tRNA molecules and can affect tRNA stability, folding, localization, transport, processing, and function (Jackman & Alfonzo, 2013) . Modifications in the anticodon loop of tRNA can function as regulators of translation by promoting or preventing codon-anticodon interaction, by altering charge or base-pairing potential. Global studies using cell systems have demonstrated that anticodon specific epitranscriptomic marks, as well as others, are dynamically regulated during cellular stress. Further it has been shown that the collection of epitranscriptomic marks change depending on the mechanism of action of the toxicants (C. T. Y. Chan et al., 2015 Chan et al., , 2010 Dewe, Fuller, Lentini, Kellner, & Fu, 2017) .",

            "text": "Toxicant specific reprogramming of the epitranscriptome housed on tRNA has been demonstrated in bacterial, yeast and human cell studies (C. T. Y. Chan et al., 2015 Chan et al., , 2010 Dewe et al., 2017) . For example, in response to oxidizing agents such as \u03b3radiation, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or peroxynitrile (ONOO -), there is a significant increase in m 5 C, ncm 5 U, and i 6 A levels in yeast tRNA while the same modifications are unaffected in response to alkylating agents. In contrast, Um, mcm 5 U, mcm 5 s 2 U, m 2 G, and m 1 A modification levels increase in response to alkylating agents ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS), methylmethanesulfonate (MMS), isopropyl methanesulfonate (IMS) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-mitrosoguanidine (MNNG) , and are conversely unaffected by treatment with oxidizing agents. These data support the idea that there is a highly predictive and toxicant-dependent system of translational control used to respond to cellular stress. Specifically the reprogrammed tRNA promotes the selective translation of codon-biased mRNAs in order to translate critical survival proteins. Codon biased transcripts being more efficiently translated by increased epitranscriptomic marks has been observed in bacteria (Chionh et al., 2016) , yeast , mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Endres et al., 2015) and human melanoma cells (Rapino et al., 2018) . A specific example of epitranscriptomic marks driving codon biased translation is found with the RNA modifications 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm 5 U) and 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine-2'-O-methyluridine (mcm 5 Um) housed on wobble uridine of selenocysteine tRNA (tRNA Sec ) in mice and humans. The epitranscriptomic marks mcm 5 U and mcm 5 Um are an integral part of the specialized addition of the selenocysteine (Sec) amino acid into proteins. The resulting selenoproteins are made by stop codon recoding (Copeland, 2003; Copeland, Fletcher, Carlson, Hatfield, & Driscoll, 2000; Endres et al., 2015; Low & Berry, 1996; Songe-Moller et al., 2010) , where mcm 5 U and mcm 5 Um promote binding of the tRNA Sec anticodon to the UGA stop codon on mRNA. Corresponding selenoprotein transcripts are inherently codon-biased because of this unusual in-frame UGA stop codon as well as the actual stop codon (Doyle et al., 2016) . Importantly though, other core elements are required for stop codon recoding and they include a stem-loop structure in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the transcript termed the Sec Insertion Sequence (SECIS) element, a SECIS Binding Protein (SBP2), and SEC-specific elongation factors (EFSec) (Driscoll & Copeland, 2003) .",

ALKBH8 has three functional domains, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), a 2-oxogluterate Fe 2+ -dependent oxygenase (2-OG-Fe(II)) domain, sometimes referred to as the AlkB domain, and a methyltransferase domain (Fig. 1) . The Elongator complex which includes six proteins (Elp1-6) is required for the carboxymethylation of uridine (U) to 5-carbonylmethyluridine (cm 5 U) Karlsborn et al., 2014) . ALKBH8 methyltransferase activity on the wobble uridine of tRNA Sec uses 5-carbonylmethyluridine (cm 5 U) as a substrate to produce mcm 5 U. ALKBH8 also catalyzes wobble mcm 5 U in tRNA Lys(UUU) , tRNA Gln(UUG) and tRNA Glu(UUC) and tRNA Arg(UCU) (D. Hatfield & Gladyshev, 2002; Songe-Moller et al., 2010; Sprinzl & Vassilenko, 2005) . Furthermore, mcm 5 U can undergo additional modifications to mcm 5 Um (tRNA Sec ) (Endres et al., 2015;  Songe-Moller et al., 2010), mcm 5 s 2 U (tRNA Glu(UUC, tRNA Arg(UCU) and tRNA Lys(UUU) ) (Sprinzl & Vassilenko, 2005) , and mchm 5 U (tRNA Gly(UCC) and tRNA Arg(UCG) )(Van Den Born et al., 2011) . Among these further modifications to mcm 5 U, only mchm 5 U is known to be catalyzed directly by ALKBH8 via its 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase domain (Van Den Born et al., 2011) . The mcm 5 s 2 U modification depends on the CTU1/CTU2 enzyme complex, while formation of mcm 5 Um is dependent on ALKBH8 (Dewez et al., 2008; Endres et al., 2015; Songe-Moller et al., 2010) .",

NA is found in cigarette smoke, gasoline, and mothballs (Jia & Batterman, 2010; Kakareka & Kukharchyk, 2003; Sudakin, Stone, & Power, 2011) Li et al., 2008) . NA is currently classified as a possible human carcinogen (IARC, 2002) and has been shown to cause lesions and tumors in rodents, although the mechanism of toxicity and carcinogenicity is still under debate (Abdo et al., 1992; Abdo, Grumbein, Chou, & Herbert, 2001) . Notably NA has been shown to cause oxidative DNA damage (Lin et al., 2005) , and DNA adduct formation Carratt et al., 2019) . All tumor formation in both mice and rats was accompanied by cytotoxicity, with recurrent damage and repair/proliferation thought to be one of the driving forces behind NA-induced tumor formation in the lung (DeStefano-Shields, Morin, & Buckpitt, 2010; Van Winkle, Buckpitt, Nishio, Isaac, & Plopper, 1995) . Importantly, glutathione (GSH) depletion is a major determinant in NA-induced lung toxicity, and precedes observable injury. Mice treated with the GSH depleter dimethylmaleate before exposure suffered significantly more injury to the nasal and intrapulmonary airway epithelium (Phimister, Lee, Morin, Buckpitt, & Plopper, 2004) and mice treated with the GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine exhibited similar effects (West et al., 2003 (West et al., , 2002 . Treatment of mice with glutathione prodrugs prevent lung cell toxicity and necrosis (Phimister, Nagasawa, Buckpitt, & Plopper, 2005) . Selenoprotein H plays a role in glutathione synthesis by acting as a transcription factor to promote transcription of genes critical for glutathione synthesis as well as exhibiting oxidoreductase activity (Panee, Stoytcheva, Liu, & Berry, 2007) . As such, disrupted ALKBH8 epitranscriptomic systems leading to dysregulated translation of selenoproteins required for GSH synthesis, use and redox balance are likely to sensitize mice to NA.",

We used a Simple Western (Wes) automated western blot tool for protein detection. Under normal growth conditions, we observed little difference in GPX1, GPX3, and Selenoprotein S (SELS) protein levels. In contrast we observed a significant decrease in TRXR1, TRXR2 and TRX2 protein levels in the lungs of Alkbh8 def mice. TRXRs are Sec-containing proteins critical for all signaling pathways in which thioredoxin (TRX) is involved as a reducing agent as TRXRs maintain TRX in its reduced and active state. As such, they support other TRX-dependent antioxidants such as methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRS) and peroxiredoxins (PRXs). Dysfunctions in the TRXR system have been linked to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and sensitivity to added stress (Lopert, Day, & Patel, 2012) , and molecular reprogramming in the lung to adapt to the stress (Locy et al., 2012) . TRX2 is localized to the mitochondria and is an essential member of the thioredoxin system, with deletions associated with massive dysregulation of redox balance, apoptosis and early embryonic lethality in mice, corresponding to the time when mitochondria develop to begin oxidative phosphorylation (Nonn, Williams, Erickson, & Powis, 2003; Tanaka et al., 2002) . TRX2 is a non-selenoprotein enzyme containing cysteine in the active site and functions to maintain protein thiols in a reduced state, thereby becoming oxidized. As such, we predicted that molecular reprogramming of ROS and protein-damage response genes may play a factor in Alkbh8 def mouse lungs in response to TRX2 and TRXR1 and TRXR2",

We note that the increase in ORP observed in Fig. 3A in untreated Alkbh8 def mice is no longer seen in the corn oil condition. Although relative values are presented, we attribute this to a slight increase in WT ORP after corn oil injection while Alkbh8 def ORP remained the same (raw data not shown). This may suggest some metabolic differences between WT and Alkbh8 def mice. While ORP is a general indicator of oxidative stress, a more specific in vivo measure is 8-isoprostane levels. We observed an increase in 8-isoprostane levels in both WT and Alkbh8 def mice treated with NA, relative to the untreated sample (Fig. 5B) . WT NA-treated mice show a statistically significant increase (P \u2264 0.05) in 8-isoprostane levels relative to the corn-oil treated WT group, while NA-treated Alkbh8 def mice show a more significant increase (P \u2264 0.001) relative to corn oil-treated mice. Although Alkbh8 def mice show an increase in 8isoprostanes in the lung, the difference relative to the WT NA-challenged mice is not statistically significant (P = 0.23). DM mice do not have notable differences in 8isoprostane levels in the lung between corn oil and NA treatment conditions. We again note a small but statistically significant difference in the corn oil condition between WT and Alkbh8 def , supporting the idea of metabolic differences between the mice. We further measured the GSH and GSSG in CO and 200mg/kg NA-treated mouse lungs after 24 hour exposure.

While we note decreased TRXR1 and 2 in Alkbh8 def lungs under basal conditions (Fig. 2E) , after corn oil treatment the levels are similar to WT corn oil treated lungs again suggesting that there may be some metabolic effect or some level of oxidants present in the oil causing the Alkbh8 def to upregulate TRXR proteins from baseline.

First, Alkbh8 def mice function under increased oxidative stress at basal conditions (Fig. 3A-C) , which likely pre-conditions them for oxidative stress at acute doses due to molecular reprograming of oxidative stress response systems (Endres et al., 2015) . Second, acute exposure to NA results in damage to the pulmonary club cells in the airway epithelium comprising only a small fraction of all lung cells. Due to the large cellular heterogeneity of the lung material used for RNAseq, this may lead to limited sensitivity of the assay to detect changes which are only occurring in club cells. As such, we note a much greater increase in inflammatory markers in Alkbh8 def mice relative to WT mice in response to NA. As inflammatory cells, such as cytokine and chemokine-secreting macrophages, are recruited and distributed throughout the lung including airways and alveolar regions, RNAseq was able to detect the increases in inflammatory transcripts, which comprise by far the largest group of upregulated transcripts in response to NA treatment. For example, Il6 had a 23.8 fold upregulation relative to WT mouse lungs. IL6 is produced at sites of tissue inflammation and is important in the response to acute lung injury (Gadient & Patterson, 1999; Voiriot et al., 2017 Fig 4) . These data support the idea that there is clear evidence of increased stress, inflammation and lung injury in the lungs of Alkbh8 def mice 24 hours after NA.",

As the turnaround time for WT mice was around day 3, we sent lung tissues after 3-days of exposure to a boardcertified pathologist for analysis. While WT mice had the early classic response of flattened and elongated club cells and some necrosis, they begin to recover the cuboidal structure of their airway epithelial cells around day 3, a sign of tolerance. Meanwhile, Alkbh8 def lungs remain severely damaged with complete absence of epithelial cells in many parts of the bronchioles and injury and necrosis extending to ciliated cells to a moderate degree (Supplemental Fig. 6 ). The Alkbh8 def mice also present blood clot formation in the alveoli suggesting either a greater incidence of hemolytic anemia, which NA is known to cause and which can contribute to intravascular coagulation, or injury to lung cells outside of the airways, such as endothelial cells in alveolar capillaries (ATSDR, 2005; Cappellini, 2007) .",

            "text": "We have previously shown that under normal growth conditions mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in the epitranscriptomic writer ALKBH8 have increased ROS and DNA damage but adapt to these stresses by molecular reprogramming stress-response transcript levels (Endres et al., 2015) . Our current study supports the idea that this reprogramming can be extended to the lungs of Alkbh8 def mice, as they have adapted to the epitranscriptomic deficiency and corresponding decrease in selenoprotein levels by upregulating the expression of inflammation, DNA repair and protein stress-response transcripts and markers. Molecular reprogramming of stress response systems in response to an epitranscriptomic writer deficiency has also been reported in lower organisms. For example, deficiencies in wobble uridine modification systems in budding yeast have been linked to upregulation of heat shock and unfolded protein response pathways (Patil et al., 2012) . Molecular reprogramming due to cellular stress, including oxidative stress, protein stress and DNA damage, is also a well-documented response and has implications in development, aging and disease susceptibility. For example, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a master regulator of cellular resistance to oxidative stress(Qiang Ma, 2013; Vomund, Sch\u00e4fer, Parnham, Br\u00fcne, & Von Knethen, 2017) . In response to oxidative stress, NRF2 dissociates from its negative regulator KEAP1, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to specific antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter region of antioxidant and cytoprotective protein genes, including enzymes that catalyze glutathione synthesis (Qiang Ma, 2013; Nguyen, Nioi, & Pickett, 2009 Ma & He, 2012; Motohashi & Yamamoto, 2004; Rangasamy et al., 2004) , while boosting NRF2 activity has a protective effect against oxidative damage (Talalay, Dinkova-Kostova, & Holtzclaw, 2003) . Nevertheless, mice lacking NRF2 have been shown to compensate for the deficiency by upregulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which mediates cardioprotection against myocardia ischemia in conditions of decreased antioxidant capacity (Erkens et al., 2018) . eNOS synthesizes nitric oxide, which has potent antioxidant effects (Erkens et al., 2018; Wink et al., 2001) . Despite severely decreased glutathione levels and general antioxidant capacity, NRF2 -/mice were able to preserve their redox status, vascular function, and resist myocardial ischemia/perfusion damage (Erkens et al., 2018) . Nrf2 deficiency has also been shown to play a protective role against cardiomyopathy with molecular reprogramming of antioxidants at the transcript and protein levels playing a contributing role, with a noted increase in GPX1 transcript in NRF2 deficient mice with cardiomyopathy (Kannan et al., 2013) . NRF2 and selenoproteins have been shown to work in conjunction to protect against oxidative damage (Kawatani, Suzuki, Shimizu, Kelly, & Yamamoto, 2011) .",

A deficiency or mutation in SELS is also associated with inflammation-related disorders and has been linked to gastric cancer (Mao, Cui, & Wang, 2015) and inflammatory bowel disease (Seiderer et al., 2007) . In our study, we found a significant difference in SELS protein levels between WT and Alkbh8 def NA treated mice, which may also explain the dramatic increase in IL-6 and other inflammatory markers at the transcript level in the Alkbh8 def lungs. The dramatic increase in inflammation markers in writer deficient lungs can be also linked to increased ROS and decreased antioxidant enzymes in the form of specific seleno-and other proteins. In support of this idea, we observed deficiencies in selenoproteins TRXR1 and TRXR2 and non-selenoprotein TRX2 in Alkbh8 def mice and associated increase in oxidative stress markers ORP and 8-isoprostanes. TRXs primarily reduce oxidized protein cysteine residues to form reduced disulfide bonds, with TRX2 localized to the mitochondria. TRXs are maintained in their reduced and active state by TRXRs using NADPH as a reducing equivalent, with TRXR1 located in the cytoplasm and TRXR2 in the mitochondria. This system is critical for signaling pathways involved in the protection from oxidants (Saccoccia et al., 2014) . TRXRs are also required for development as complete knockout of TRXR1 and TRXR2 in mice result in severe growth abnormality and embryonic death at day 8.5 and 13, respectively (Bondareva et al., 2007; Conrad et al., 2004; Jakupoglu et al., 2005) .",

Our study highlights the importance of ALKBH8 in promoting tolerance, most likely via translational regulation of selenoproteins and GSH levels.

In addition to a modified tRNA Sec , elongation factors, SECIS Binding Protein 2 (SPB2), and 3' UTR Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS) elements are required for translation of the UGA stop codon found in transcripts corresponding to selenocysteine-containing proteins. transcript levels from basal WT and Alkbh8 def lungs were quantified using qPCR analysis (N = 3 per genotype, P \u2264 0.0001). E) GPX1, GPX3, SELS, TRXR1 and TRXR2 selenoprotein expression levels and non-selenoprotein TRX2 (blot only) from basal WT and Alkbh8 def lungs were assed using Wes\u00ae Simple Western. F) Targeted RNA sequencing was performed on 350 stress response genes and fold differences in number of sequence reads after normalization to endogenous control (Ribosomal protein L13a, Rpl13a) was used to generate a heat map. Expression values are Alkbh8 def lungs relative to WT under basal conditions. Notable transcripts with fold-change values of 1.5 or greater in each signaling pathway are listed. N = 2 mice per genotype. ",

B) 8isoprostane levels (pg/gram lung tissue) were increased in Alkbh8 def lungs (P = 0.0557, N = 3). C) GSH and GSSG were measured using LC-MS/MS and plotted as a ratio, with Alkbh8 def mice showing a decrease (N = 3, P \u2264 0.01) D) Basal WT and Alkbh8 def lungs were excised and enzymatically and mechanically separated into a single-cell suspension, fixed and stained with a FITC conjugated antibody specific for \u03b3-H2AX and the DRAQ5 nuclear stain, followed by quantitative imaging with an Amnis Imagestream ISX100 flow cytometer. \u03b3-H2AX foci were scored for intensity and number using the IDEAS Spot Count analysis program, presented as the frequency of cells with \u22641 spots or \u22652 spots (N = 3 mice per genotype, 10,000 cells per lung). E) \u03b3-H2AX-FITC channel fluorescence intensity was quantified and normalized to WT to demonstrate there are increased levels in Alkbh8 def lungs (P = 0.098). Mice were tested for their ability to tolerate a prolonged exposure to NA. A) Kaplan-Meier plot showing survival over 14 days after daily injection with 200 mg/kg NA. The log-rank (Mentel-Cox) test was used to generate a P-value. (P < 0.01). B) Weight was recorded daily over the 14-day study and plotted relative to starting weight. Any mice with a 20% or greater weight loss relative to starting weight were euthanized. C) Mice were tested for their ability to build tolerance to NA. The non adapted mice were treated with 5 doses of the carrier control, corn oil, followed by a 200 mg/kg high dose of NA.",

Lungs were sectioned, H&E stained, and analyzed by a board-certified pathologist as described in the methods.

Alkbh8 def mice are significantly more sensitive to NA than WT, showing higher susceptibility to lung damage both at the cellular and molecular levels. Tolerance to NA is defined as resistance to a high challenging dose after repeated exposures. WT mice develop tolerance to NA after 3 days while Alkbh8 def mice fail to develop tolerance to NA and die. Our data supports a model in which the ALKBH8 writer and epitranscriptomic marks allow cells to develop tolerance and adapt to chronic NA stress.
