As HT and other competitive enzymes are not able to completely inhibit the expression of Gal epitopes, this technique was combined with the expression of human complement inhibitors. Thus, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and aortic endothelial cells of double transgenic pigs that co-express HT and hCD59 are better protected from lysis by human serum than controls or single transgenic cells for each of the genes. 12 In addition, double transgenic cells maintained their resistance to XNA DQG FRPSOHPHQW DIWHU EHLQJ WUHDWHG IRU KRXUV ZLWK SRUFLQH SURLQ\u00c0DPPDWRU\\ cytokines. 12 Despite these advances, these pigs were developed to be used in cellular xenotransplantation and the organs have not been transplanted to nonhuman primates, so it has not been possible to study their effectiveness in this experimental model in FRPSDULVRQ WR SLJ RUJDQV FDUU\\LQJ RWKHU W\\SHV RI JHQHWLF PRGL\u00bfFDWLRQV The description of the process of nuclear transfer of a somatic cell into a germinal cell by the team led by Ian Wilmut in 1996 opened the door to the generation of \"knockout\" pigs.

Despite this progress, the majority of human sera show reactivity towards pig cells that lack for alpha1,3-GT gene, suggesting the existence of antibodies that recognise other antigens apart from the Gal epitope. 15 Therefore, the introduction of a human complement inhibitor is still necessary to completely block human serum-mediated cytotoxicity.",

Without immunosuppression AHXR occurs 4 or 5 days after the transplant of hDAF transgenic organs in baboons, 18 there being no similar results from cynomolgus monkeys. The use of an immunosuppressive regimen that includes cyclophosphamide (CYP), cyclosporin (CsA) and corticosteroids (CS) increases the mean survival of the renal transplant recipient to 7.5 days in baboons and approximately 12 days in cynomolgus monkeys. 2, 10 Parallel studies of orthotopic heart xenotransplants in baboons show mean survival rates of 12-15 days in similar conditions of immunosuppression. The addition of other immunosuppressants, such as rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate, to the aforementioned protocol and performing splenectomy during the transplantation procedure, increased the mean survival rates for renal xenografts to up to 25-35 days in cynomolgus monkeys and to 9-20 days in baboons 16, 17 (Tables 1 and 2 ). The temporary use of systemic complement inhibitors such as C1 inhibitor or soluble complement receptor 1 (sCR1, TP10), was also found to be effective, both in prolonging kidney xenograft survival and to revert AHXR, once diagnosed. 19 However, the toxicity of these products in the form of increased susceptibility to infections does not allow a long-term treatment with complement inhibitors.",

However, they all are very aggressive and lead to excessive immunosuppression, accompanied by severe side effects (gastrointestinal lesions, anaemia, infections, etc.) which in themselves jeopardise the life of the recipient. For this reason, the experiments carried out by the group led by Dr David Cooper are of great importance. These researchers performed a heterotopic heart xenograft transplantation in baboons from _1,3-GT knockout pigs, using immunosuppressive levels that were acceptable for clinical practice. 23 Most of these hearts were rejected with signs of AHXR or thrombotic microangiopathy. Non-etheless, they reached average and maximum survival times of 78 days and 6 months respectively, the longest survivals of porcine xenografts in nonhuman primates described to date. 23 The thrombotic microangiopathy described in these experiments is considered to be another manifestation of AHXR, closely linked to the antibody-mediated response.

Our group has preliminary data suggesting that these antibodies are not directed against porcine proteins, but rather the targets, though not the Gal antigen, are also carbohydrates. Although it would be reasonable to expect that the antibodies are directed against many epitopes, their characterization would open the possibility of developing new treatments to prevent or treat AHXR. Given that one of the principal advantages of xenotransplantation is the possibility of modifying the donor organ, the solution for AHXR would come from genetically engineering the donor animal, to avoid the expression of those elements that cause a uncontrollable production of xenoantibodies.",
