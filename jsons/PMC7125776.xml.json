            "text": "The immune network theory proposes the idea that anti-idiotypic antibodies are produced during the immune response to a given antigen (Jerne, 1974). A subset of these anti-idiotypic antibodies, termed internal image antibodies, or Ab2\u03b2, are able to mimic the molecular structure of the nominal antigen Jerne et al 1982, Pan et al 1995. Such anti-idiotypic antibodies have been successfully isolated and characterised from animals immunised with external antigens Goldbaum et al 1998, Bona 1996, Pan et al 1995. In humans, naturally occurring auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies have been detected serologically in patients with autoimmune diseases, but also in normal donors Jayne et al 1993, Bronshtein et al 1992, Zouali and Eyquem 1983. However, the isolation and characterisation of such antibodies has not been achieved on the monoclonal level using conventional hybridoma technology (K\u00f6hler & Milstein, 1975). We have previously shown that human anti-idiotypic antibodies against human IgE can be isolated from a non-immune repertoire using phage display technology (Vogel et al., 1994). Here, we used the same technology to isolate human anti-idiotypic Fab fragments able to mimic an epitope from the constant part of human IgE. To define such an epitope, we used a monoclonal anti-human (mAb) IgE antibody, termed BSW17 (Knutti-Mueller et al., 1986). With this mAb we had screened phage-displayed random peptide libraries and isolated peptides mimicking an epitope located in the third and fourth constant domain of IgE Rudolf et al 1998, Rudolf et al 2000. Here, we address the question of whether it would be possible to isolate an anti-idiotypic antibody that mimics the same epitope (Figure 1).\n",

RNA was extracted from each source and used independently to prepare PCR-amplified cDNA corresponding to the variable heavy chain immunoglobulin (Ig) region and a part of the constant region of IgG1 (Fd) and the Ig light chains \u03ba and \u03bb. The cDNAs were cloned into the pComb3 vector system, and Fab libraries from the three different sources were expressed separately on the surface of filamentous phage and then pooled for further use. To select anti-Id antibodies specific for BSW17, the pooled libraries were subjected to four rounds of biopanning on solid-phase BSW17 (Marks et al., 1991). After the last round of panning, eight positive clones were selected out of 50 clones, and all of them recognised the antigen-binding site of BSW17. This was demonstrated in an inhibition assay where the binding of the Fab clones to BSW17 was inhibited by the two previously isolated IgE mimotopes corresponding to the third and fourth domain of IgE (data not shown).",

Sequence analysis revealed that only two types of Fab clones were isolated. Figure 2\nshows the deduced amino acid sequences of the two anti-Id Fab clones compared with the most homologous germline genes. The two Fab clones (anti-Id-BSW17.52 and anti-Id-BSW17.43) showed the highest level of homology to two genes derived from different VH families, 22-2 B from VH3 and DP-65 from VH4. The VH CDR3 regions of both clones were also markedly different in length and sequence, suggesting that they originated from two different B-cell clones. Further, the light chains of these Fab clones were homologous to two different germline genes belonging to different families, V\u03ba1 and V\u03bb1 (Figure 2). The V-genes of both clones showed several differences from the germline V-gene segments, suggesting that they are derived from somatically mutated B-cells. As the source of our immunoglobulin genes was a pool of three donors, we cannot conclude whether the anti-idiotypic specificities were derived from one individual or whether both specificities may actually be present in all three donors.",

A flow cytometric assay was used to determine whether the anti-Id-BSW17 Fab clones were able to inhibit the binding of BSW17 to IgE-primed CHO\u03b1 cells. The CHO\u03b1 cells were first incubated with a monoclonal human IgE (Z\u00fcrcher et al., 1995), followed by incubation with preformed complexes of BSW17 and soluble anti-Id-BSW17 Fab fragments. As shown in Figure 3, the binding of BSW17 to CHO\u03b1 cells decreased with increasing concentrations of anti-Id-BSW17 Fab fragments, indicating that the two anti-Id-BSW17 Fab clones were able to inhibit the binding of BSW17 to IgE. These results imply that the two anti-Id-BSW17 Fab clones mimic epitope regions on IgE recognised by the mAb BSW17.",

Visual and computational analysis revealed that the VH of both Fab clones, as well as a part of the C\u03b53 mimotope, share sequence homology and mimic a common IgE epitope covering the region from Thr373 to Asn383 (Figure 4(a)). This common epitope emerges on the surface of the IgE molecule and has considerable surface solvent accessibility. These data, and the fact that structural analysis of the common epitope revealed a \u03b2-turn, support the prediction that this region is antigenic (Chou et al., 1978) and is recognised by BSW17 as described by Knutti-Mueller et al. (1986). Furthermore, this region has been reported to overlap with the possible IgE-binding site of the high-affinity IgE receptor. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis, two amino acid residues (Arg376, Ser378) present in this region were found to be directly involved in high-affinity receptor binding Presta et al 1994, Helm et al 1996.",

The homologous region of this anti-Id-BSW17.43 light chain appears to span over the common epitope (Figure 4(b)) mimicked by the heavy chains of both anti-Id Fabs, suggesting that for this second anti-Id the light chain might be involved in the antigen mimicry. Furthermore, two residues, Arg427 and Met430, present in this homologous region have been shown by Presta et al.

To assess this functional mimicry, two rabbits were immunised with soluble anti-Id-BSW17.52 and anti-Id-BSW17.43 Fab preparations four times at two-week intervals; after seven weeks, the sera were tested for anti-IgE activity. Because the C\u03b53 epitope region, mimicked by the heavy and light chains of both anti-Id Fab clones, has been shown to be involved in high-affinity receptor binding, the antibodies raised against the two anti-Id Fab clones were expected to inhibit binding of IgE to its high-affinity receptor by blocking the IgE-binding domain. To assess this inhibitory activity, the rabbit antisera were first affinity-purified on human IgE and then tested in an inhibition ELISA. Figure 5\nshows that the two purified rabbit IgG preparations inhibit the binding of IgE to the \u03b1-chain of Fc\u03b5RI. However, the affinity-purified IgG of the rabbit immunised with the second anti-Id BSW17.43 Fab showed a stronger inhibition of IgE binding to the \u03b1-chain than the IgG purified from the rabbit immunised with the first anti-Id BSW17.52 Fab. Using surface plasmon resonance in the BIAcore system (Malborg et al., 1996), the affinity of both purified IgG preparations to human IgE was determined. The polyclonal anti-anti-idiotypic IgG preparation purified from the rabbits immunised with anti-Id BSW17.52 and anti-Id BSW17.43 bound to human IgE with K\nd of 6\u00d7109 M\u22121 and of 4\u00d71010 M\u22121, respectively. This result suggests that both anti-Id can act as a functional image of the IgE molecule. Accordingly, the anti-Id BSW17.43 Fab, which shows the closest molecular mimicry to the IgE molecule, induces antibodies in vivo with the greatest inhibitory effect and the highest affinity to the IgE molecule.",

            "text": "Although functional mimicry has been reported for some anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking self antigens, there have been no studies to date that have demonstrated structural similarity between self antigens and human anti-idiotypic antibodies. Mouse monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies that mimic self structures have already been reported (Lubahn et al., 1990; Taub et al 1992, Abrams et al 1992, Garcia et al 1992; Perosa et al., 1994). Garcia et al. (1992) described a system using angiotensin which is a phylogenetically conserved octapeptide and thus can be considered as a self antigen. In this system, rabbit polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) specific to a monoclonal anti-angiotensin (Ab1) were used to obtain anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3). The conformation of the angiotensin in the complex with Ab3 has suggested that a CDR of the Ab2 could have elicited the angiotensin-specific Ab3. However, due to the polyclonal nature of the anti-idiotypic antibodies, no structural study of Ab2 was performed to confirm this hypothesis. In our system we have isolated two human monoclonal human anti-idotypic antibodies and demonstrated amino acid sequence-based structural homology by identifying the cross-reactive residues responsible for the mimicry. Additionally, we have shown that neither immunisation nor affinity maturation is a prerequisite for generating high-affinity anti-idiotypic antibodies from phage display libraries. Recently, the isolation of human recombinant anti-idiotypic scFv against coronavirus from a non-immune phage display library has been reported (Lamarre & Talbot, 1997). However, these scFv antibodies were not able to induce an antiviral immune response sufficiently strong to protect immunised animals. In our case, the fact that two human anti-idiotypic Fab fragments behaved as surrogate antigens and induced an anti-IgE response in rabbits may circumvent the problem of using non-human antibodies in humans. Preliminary results of monkey immunisations have shown that the anti-idiotypic antibodies can induce an anti-IgE response that is able to abolish partially reactivity in an in vivo passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test in the case of allergen challenge. Thus, the anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used as an active vaccine analogous to the IgE mimotope peptides that have been previously isolated and are currently in the preclinical testing phase. Clearly, the anti-idiotypic antibodies represent a much larger epitope of IgE than the mimotope derived from random phage peptide libraries. Moreover, in a vaccination procedure these anti-idiotypic antibodies may be better tolerated than peptides that have to be coupled to immunogenic carriers. Thus, it can be expected that in humans the anti-idiotypic antibodies will induce, as already seen in monkeys, an anti-IgE immune response that would prevent binding of IgE to the Fc\u03b5RI, and consequently the sensitisation of the effector cells implicated in allergic disease.",
