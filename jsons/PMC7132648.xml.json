Recreancy is the concept used to describe the relationships among trust and risk. According to recreancy theory, the trust that individuals have in society's institutions is based on the perception of 2 important considerations: the institution's competency to perform the tasks normally associated with it, and the institution's fiduciary responsibility in the sense that it is consciously working for the best interests of the population.5 In social risk situations, such as epidemics, trust in the government to respond effectively is important for the public to feel that their health interests will be maximally attended to.6\n",

The nature of public health, as a set of interventions requiring behavioral actions and lifestyle changes, requires legitimacy to achieve implementation of health policy. The local community may be viewed as a problem-solving system organized to improve the health of its residents and to be the main line of defense against contagions.7 The local health care system therefore comes under public scrutiny and is ultimately deemed to be positive or recreant. For this reason we distinguish between trust in the federal government's ability to fight outbreaks and trust in the local hospitals' ability.",

The organization and delivery of health care are topics of serious disagreement between the 2 parties. The Republican Party tends to favor less government involvement than the Democratic Party. Although individual members of the parties do not necessarily agree with their party's position on all matters, their behavior and attitudes in many issues reflect their party's position.15 At issue here is if members of the major parties differ in terms of willingness to receive the H1N1 vaccine.",

There is a slight underrepresentation of ethnic minority groups and some over-representation of college graduates. To correct for these slight biases, a weighted procedure was used.

Was the fear associated with H1N1 generated by the rate of mortality and rapidity of the spread of the disease that made it seem more virulent than other outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome? Would different outbreaks produce different results? Given the fact that viral outbreaks appear somewhere in the world much of the time, we have additional opportunities to test the recreancy hypothesis in different cultural settings. Investigations of these cases will help us determine whether vaccination is truly the most important public health development in recent years.",

Trust extends to local community health care organizations as well.2.Political partisanship: to a significant degree, trust in the government's ability to deal with the H1N1 outbreak is based on political partisan attitudes about the proper role of government; members of political parties endorsing social health care programs are more willing to be vaccinated than others.3.Vulnerability: age, family composition, and ethnicity are also factors influencing willingness to be vaccinated. Collectively, they point to a perceived vulnerability factor on the part of many that may be operating in the decision to seek vaccination.4.Fear of infection: independent of other factors, concern about getting the flu is significant in willingness to be vaccinated, the fear, the more willing to be vaccinated.\n",

We suggest that epidemics present situations that differ from the normal context of vaccination decision-making and are therefore worthy of additional investigation. Future studies should build on this study and expand the study of the role of social trust in vaccination to the sources of such social and institutional trust. For example, an important topic for future study is the role of media content in trust in the ability of the government and local hospitals to deal with a health crisis and the role of media content on trust to vaccines.",

A large percentage of the sample expressed hesitancy to be vaccinated. Our study was directed at understanding the sources of this hesitancy and indicated that increasing the likelihood of the population to participate in vaccination programs requires interventions directed at increasing the trust of the population in the government public health capabilities and the role of the local hospitals. A development of a comprehensive policy to increase recreancy in situations of real social risk is needed.",
