The family Paramyxoviridae is divided into two subfamilies (Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae), with Hendra virus (HeV) being the foundation member of the genus Henipavirus in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae. The discovery of the HeV and Nipah virus (NiV) had a striking impact on our understanding of paramyxovirus biology. Henipaviruses have a much wider host range and a significantly larger genome than other paramyxoviruses, and to date are the only biosafety level (BSL)-4 agents within the family. With mortality rates of human infection between 50 and 100%, HeV and NiV are among the most deadly viruses known to infect humans.",

            "text": "HeV emerged in 1994 in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra, Queensland, Australia, where it caused an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in horses that led to the natural death or euthanasia of 14 out of 21 affected animals. Two people who had close contact with the infected horses were infected and one of these patients died (Murray et al. 1995). Extensive sampling demonstrated that Australian mainland flying foxes (family Pteropodidae, genus pteropus) were seropositive for neutralising antibodies against HeV (Young et al. 1996), while the virus was subsequently isolated from flying fox uterine fluid and urine (Halpin et al. 2000), providing strong evidence for Australian mainland flying foxes as the HeV reservoir. Sporadic HeV incidents occurred in horses between 1994 and 2010, with 14 events identified. An alarming number of HeV incidents (34 in total) occurred between 2011 and 2013, with 18 of those occurring in 2011 alone, highlighting the unpredictable nature of HeV outbreaks. Seven human cases of HeV disease have been observed, four of which resulted in fatal disease. All recorded cases of HeV transmission to humans have occurred directly from affected horses. The horses are believed to have acquired HeV infection following direct exposure to secretions from flying foxes. More recently, the decline of reported human cases of HeV infection is potentially due to the development of a vaccine to inhibit HeV disease in horses (Middleton et al. 2014).",

Commercial pig farmers suffered disease characterised by febrile encephalitis that was linked to mild respiratory and neurological disease in pigs (Mohd Nor et al. 2000; From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1999). Nucleotide sequencing demonstrated the virus was closely related to HeV, whilst fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family, Pteropus genus, were confirmed as the natural reservoir (Yob et al. 2001). Epidemiological evidence suggested that human infections were caused by transmission from pigs which likely had prior contact with fruit bats (Update: outbreak of Nipah virus\u2013Malaysia and Singapore 1999). By mid-1999, cases of human infection were reported in Singapore, where abattoir workers developed NiV infection associated with contact with pigs imported from Malaysia. This initial outbreak of NiV in Malaysia resulted in 265 human cases reported with 105 deaths. Since 2001, NiV outbreaks have been reported almost every year in selected districts of Bangladesh (Hossain et al. 2008; Luby et al. 2009a). Unlike HeV, human-to-human transmission of NiV has been documented (Luby et al. 2009b), including in a hospital setting.",

            "text": "An increasing focus on flying foxes as viral reservoirs has led to the discovery of new henipaviruses. The genus was expanded in 2012 upon the isolation and characterisation of Cedar virus (CedPV), isolated from bat urine samples from a flying fox colony in Cedar Grove, South East Queensland. CedPV shows a remarkably similar genome organisation to HeV and NiV, antigenic cross-reactivity of the nucleocapsid protein between henipaviruses, and shares the same predominant entry receptor molecule, ephrin-B2 (Marsh et al. 2012). However, a critical difference between CedPV and HeV and NiV is that the CedPV P gene lacks coding capacity for the immune antagonising V protein, whilst the CedPV P protein shows an impaired capacity to bind and inhibit IFN signalling via signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT2 (Lieu et al. 2015). Accordingly, CedPV infection induces a robust type I interferon (IFN) response in human cells in vitro and does not cause clinical disease in ferret and guinea pig models of disease. Such findings highlight the importance of immune evasion in the context of henipavirus pathogenicity and demonstrate the diverse range of pathogenicity within the same genus.",

West African fruit bats harbour neutralising antibodies against HeV and NiV in particular, demonstrating a wider geographical range for henipaviruses not limited to pteropid bats (Hayman et al. 2008). Furthermore, a novel henipa-like virus, Mojiang paramyxovirus, was isolated from rats in the Yunnan Province of China in 2012 and may have caused fatal disease in three individuals (Wu et al. 2014). Alarmingly, a recent study looking at bat and human serum samples from Cameroon found that 3\u20134% of human samples were seropositive for henipaviruses, and that this was almost exclusively among individuals who reported butchering bat meat, providing the first evidence of human henipavirus spillover infections in Africa (Pernet et al. 2014).",

            "text": "There are currently no licensed therapies to treat human cases of henipavirus infection. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of host pathways exploited by henipaviruses for infection may identify targets for new antiviral therapies. Viruses rely on the cell host machinery for completion of their infection cycle and therefore have adapted to interact with or exploit host molecules. Retroviruses, most DNA viruses, and many orthomyxoviruses replicate their genomes in the host nucleus. Conversely, most positive-sense single-stranded viruses such as picornaviruses and flaviviruses and negative-sense, single-stranded viruses such as filoviruses, rhabdoviruses, and paramyxoviruses are perceived as cytoplasmic viruses and therefore are believed to not have a nuclear stage in their life cycle, replicating their genome entirely in the cytoplasm (Lamb and Parks 2007). However, proteins of some of these viruses can traffic into nuclear compartments during infection (Peeples 1988; Yoshida et al. 1976; Ghildyal et al. 2003; Monaghan et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2010) and this movement is sometimes critical for efficient infection (Wang et al. 2010). This evidence indicates that the host nucleus may play a significant role in the infection cycle of henipaviruses and that the dynamics of virus\u2013host interactions that occur in the nuclear compartments is an understudied area of molecular biology and virology. Furthermore, since important discoveries in cell biology often follow studies of how viruses exploit normal host machinery, investigations into these nuclear interactions may reveal interesting novel insights into the cell biology of the mammalian nucleus. With this in mind, functional genomics provides a powerful and unbiased approach to study these biological questions.",

A wide range of laboratory techniques can be considered as functional genomics, including genome interaction mapping (at the DNA level), microarrays, transcriptomics and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) (at the RNA level), yeast 2 hybrid systems and affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry (at the protein level) and loss-of-function studies such as mutational studies, RNA interference (RNAi) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) studies. Functional genomics has demonstrated much power in its ability to dissect the dynamic interplay between host and viral factors during a virus infection, paving the way for novel drug targets. For instance, a haploid genetic screen resulted in the discovery of the once elusive entry receptor for Ebola virus (Carette et al. 2011). There have been many full- or partial-genome RNAi screens of host\u2013virus interactions, including orthomyxoviruses (Brass et al. 2009; Hao et al. 2008; Karlas et al. 2010; Konig et al. 2010; Shapira et al. 2009), retroviruses (Zhou et al. 2008; Konig et al. 2008; Brass et al. 2008) and flaviviruses (Ang et al. 2010; Sessions et al. 2009). Until recently, such information was lacking for henipaviruses, and perhaps surprisingly, for paramyxoviruses generally.",

BSL-4 facilities feature additional precautions to protect workers from infections and prevent exposure, such as infectious work being conducted within class II biosafety cabinets, limited access by secure, locked doors, HEPA filtration of laboratory air, and additional primary containment (positive pressure air suits or class III biosafety cabinets). Due to these limitations, previous genome-wide screens for BSL-4 viruses used surrogate viruses, such as pseudotyped particles, and have been performed under BSL-2 conditions (Kouznetsova et al. 2015; Kleinfelter et al. 2015).",

Transcriptomics and proteomics have been utilised to uncover key differences in cellular responses to HeV infection in HeV disease-susceptible (human) and disease-resistant (bat) cells, and suggest that activation of apoptosis pathways via the innate immune pathway may contribute to the tolerance of henipaviruses by flying foxes (Wynne et al. 2014). Here we largely focus on findings from two recent RNAi screens to identify protein-coding genes and host-encoded microRNAs impacting the henipavirus infection cycle in human cells. Not only can these findings be compared to published RNAi screens of host\u2013virus interactions, but the identification of host genes required for infection (as opposed to those that are merely differentially expressed during infection) may deliver new targets for the development of antiviral therapies.",

Applying a robust Z score normalisation method often used to interpret siRNA screen results (Birmingham et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2006), 585 and 630 genes were identified that promoted or suppressed HeV infection, respectively, without adversely impacting cell numbers.

By this measure, 20 high- and 46 medium-confidence genes (>2 standard deviations from mean mock values for 4/4 or 3/4, or 2/4 siRNAs, respectively) were identified as being required for HeV infection. The apparent reliance of henipavirus infection on the nuclear or nucleolar host proteins was particularly striking, as over 40% of high confidence hits localise in the nucleus or nucleolus, with many involved in ribosome biogenesis (Table 1).\n",

In the nucleolus, the RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) is responsible for transcribing the 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNA from a single polycistronic pre-rRNA, while RNA pol III transcribes the 5S rRNA in the nucleus (Xue and Barna 2012). The pre-RNAs are then cleaved and modified during the pre-rRNA processing phase. All ribosomal proteins (RP) are transcribed in the cytoplasm by RNA Pol II and then translated before migrating to the nucleolus. These RP, along with nucleolar proteins such as fibrillarin and RPL13A, are responsible for modifying the rRNAs (ribose 2\u2032-O-methylation, pseudouridylation, etc.) with the activity of more than 100 snoRNAs guiding the process in a site-specific manner. The main nucleolar protein involved in rRNA modification is fibrillarin, which methylates more than 100 sites essential for ribosome biogenesis and stability. Although these post-transcriptional modifications are crucial for ribosome functions, their roles are not yet fully understood. In eukaryotes, the large 60S subunit of ribosomes is made of the 5S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA along with multiple large subunit ribosomal proteins (RPL), while the small 40S subunit is made of the 18S rRNA along with multiple small subunit ribosomal proteins (RPS). The two subunits are assembled in the nucleolus into the 80S ribosomes before being transferred into the cytoplasm.",

A cap-independent translation mechanism also utilised by a subset of host proteins is called Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES)-mediated translation. It is believed that most genes translated via an IRES are related to stress response, cell proliferation, cell death/survival, and that IRES-mediated translation happens when the canonical cap-dependent translation is inhibited either by the host reaction to environmental factors, damage, stress or infections. However, a group recently suggested that thousands of human genes are translated via this cap-independent mechanism, representing a 50-fold increase in the number of sequences previously associated with this translation pathway (Weingarten-Gabbay et al. 2016).",

Whilst the RPL40-dependent form of cap-dependent translation remains to be characterised in detail, one could speculate that fibrillarin, like RPL40, acts a novel initiation factor for henipavirus mRNAs. The fact that depleting cells of fibrillarin did not impact synthesis of influenza A viral proteins (which occurs via the canonical cap-dependent pathway) suggests that henipavirus mRNA translation occurs via a non-canonical pathway, perhaps used by a subset of cellular transcripts. Such a concept would allow henipavirus protein synthesis to proceed in an environment where viruses may induce cellular translation shutdown in order to suppress host antiviral immune responses. There are several reports of paramyxoviruses blocking canonical translation pathways, including the MeV N protein binding to the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3-p40) (Sato et al. 2007), whilst the P and V proteins of simian virus 5 (SV5) limit activation of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) to limit both host and viral protein translation (Gainey et al. 2008). Similar to SV5, siRNA-mediated depletion of PKR results in increased HeV growth (robust Z score 1.46), consistent with the notion that shutdown of host protein translation inhibits henipavirus infection.",

Within the Paramyxoviridae, nuclear localisation of matrix (M) protein has previously been described for NDV (Peeples 1988), Sendai virus (SeV) (Yoshida et al. 1976), human respiratory syncytial virus (Ghildyal et al. 2003), HeV (Monaghan et al. 2014) and NiV (Wang et al. 2010). During the early stages of henipavirus infection or when expressed ectopically (Monaghan et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2010), the HeV and NiV M proteins traffic through the nucleolus to the cytoplasm. It has been recently shown that nuclear traffic is required for the henipavirus M protein to coordinate viral budding. The henipavirus M protein is a structural protein that mediates viral assembly and budding (Liljeroos and Butcher 2012; Takimoto and Portner 2004; Eaton et al. 2007). Indeed, for both HeV-M and NiV-M, overexpression of these proteins alone is sufficient to trigger viral-like particles (VLPs) that bud into the supernatant. Wang and colleagues (2010) demonstrated that mutation of NiV-M nuclear localisation signals (NLS) or nuclear export signals (NES) blocks nuclear/cytoplasmic traffic and impairs viral budding. Furthermore, a highly conserved lysine residue in the NLS (K258) serves two functions: its positive charge mediates NiV-M nuclear import, while is also a potential site for monoubiquitination which regulates NiV-M nuclear export. Mutation of K258 or the treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 inhibits both NiV-M budding and NiV infection. Consistent with this work, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the protein ubiquitin D (UBD) inhibits HeV and NiV infection (Deffrasnes et al. 2016).",

The multi-faceted roles of paramyxovirus proteins in replication-specific roles and various cellular processes, particularly immune evasion, would suggest so. To explore whether M binds to host proteins associated with infection efficiency, results from the genome-wide RNAi HeV screen were cross-referenced against a proteomics study by Pentecost and colleagues cataloguing host proteins that bind HeV-M and NiV-M, among other paramyxovirus M proteins (Pentecost et al. 2015). That study revealed that the henipavirus M interactome spans hundreds of host proteins, with interactions with nuclear pore complex proteins, nuclear transport receptors and nucleolar proteins particularly prevalent. Interestingly, NiV-M and HeV-M interactomes show notable overlap to other paramyxovirus M proteins, including SeV and NDV, with over 60% of the proteins found in any single interactome also found in the interactomes of one or more of the other three viruses (Pentecost et al. 2015). Whilst the binding of fibrillarin to HeV-M was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Deffrasnes et al. 2016) and this was not observed by proteomics, interactions were observed between HeV-M and numerous nucleolar proteins such as NOP58 (Pentecost et al. 2015) which forms a complex with fibrillarin, supporting a functional interaction between fibrillarin and HeV-M.",

All four of these proteins are involved in modification of the immune response in the host cell, through inhibition of the type I interferon (IFN) responses [reviewed in (Audsley and Moseley 2013)]. Intracellular detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is mediated by membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain containing (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs). Engagement of these receptors with their agonists results in the activation of complex signalling pathways culminating in the production of cytokines and anti-microbial compounds. A critical component of this response is the type I IFN system, which induces a local antiviral state upon detection of viruses or intracellular bacteria or molecules associated with their replication (Schoggins and Rice 2011).",

This prompts the formation of STAT1\u2013STAT2\u2013IRF9 (IFN-regulatory factor 9) complexes that translocate to the nucleus and bind IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in DNA to initiate transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).

TRIM6 catalyses the synthesis of unanchored polyubiquitin chains that are used as a substrate for the activation of IkB kinase-e (IKKe), which phosphorylates IRF3 and activates IRF3-dependent transcription of type I IFN, and TNF-\u03b1. TRIM6 targeting by NiV-M occurs in the cytoplasm via an unknown mechanism not involving the proteasome or the lysosome, and requires nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking of NiV-M. Similar to viral budding, this function of M is dependant on nuclear traffic, as K258 mutants of NiV-M do not target TRIM6 for degradation.

MiRNAs function by binding to complementary sequences typically located in 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) of specific mRNA targets (Fayyad-Kazan et al. 2014; Neel and Lebrun 2013; Skalsky and Cullen 2010; Liu et al. 2013a). Depending on the degree of complementarity, this generally results in the suppression or degradation of target mRNA, thereby preventing encoded proteins from being translated (Fayyad-Kazan et al. 2014; Neel and Lebrun 2013; Skalsky and Cullen 2010). Although far less frequent, miRNA binding may also cause an increase in target mRNA translation and thus up-regulation of protein expression (Vasudevan et al. 2007).",

Inhibiting specific \u2018proviral\u2019 miRNAs, therefore, may have a direct negative impact on the viral life cycle (Janssen et al. 2013) or alternatively render the intracellular environment unfavourable for virus replication (Stewart et al. 2013).

Furthermore, inhibiting miR-146a has been found to significantly reduce HeV replication in vitro (Stewart et al. 2013). On the other hand, miR-122 is an example of a miRNA that promotes hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication by directly interacting with the viral genome\u2014this activity is the basis of the first miRNA inhibitor drug to enter phase II clinical trials (Janssen et al. 2013; Wilson and Sagan 2014).",

The screen involved the use of synthetic miRNA mimics and inhibitors targeting 834 microRNAs. Mimic and inhibitor screens identified 35 and 61 microRNAs, respectively, that promoted HeV infection, and 19 and 83 microRNAs, respectively, that inhibited virus infection. A major finding from this study was that all four members of the miR-181 family (-a to -d) promote infection by HeV and NiV. Infection promotion was primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to significantly enhance henipavirus-induced membrane fusion. Cell signalling receptors of ephrins, namely EphA5 and EphA7, were identified as novel negative regulators of henipavirus fusion. The expression of these receptors, as well as EphB4, was suppressed by miR-181 overexpression, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of several Ephs by the miRNA contributes to enhanced infection and fusion. To our knowledge, this study represented the first evidence of a host-encoded miRNA promoting virus cell entry.",

Specifically, miR-181 has been found to play a central role in the regulation of B cell differentiation and T cell selection, maturation and sensitivity (Sun et al. 2014). For instance, induction of miR-181a has been found to occur at the CD4(+)\u2013CD8(+) double-positive stage of T cell development, inhibiting the expression of CD69, Bcl-2 and T cell receptor\u2014all involved in positive selection and T cell maturation (Neilson et al. 2007). In addition, miR-181c has been found to suppress CD4+ T cell activation by targeting interleukin 2 (IL-2) (Sun et al. 2014; Xue et al. 2011). In addition, miR-181a expression levels have been shown to correlate with pro-inflammatory signals (e.g. IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) in blood and various tissues of humans with chronic inflammation, as well as in the blood of LPS-treated mice (Xie et al. 2013). Consistent with the notion that miR-181 expression is immune-responsive, levels of miR-181 were up-regulated in the biofluids of ferrets and horses infected with HeV, suggesting that the host innate immune response may promote henipavirus spread and exacerbate disease severity.",

Multiple members of the let-7 miRNA family inhibited HeV infection. There are 10 mature let-7 sequences in humans, with multiple roles described, including negative regulation of tumorigenesis (Shi et al. 2008; Esquela-Kerscher and Slack 2006). In a transcriptome-wide study in HeLa cells, genes significantly down-regulated by let-7b at either the mRNA level, protein level or both, included fourteen validated genes required for wild-type HeV infection, including AKT1 (Selbach et al. 2008). Furthermore, six proviral genes contain putative let-7b binding sites in their 3\u2032 UTR (AKT1, C6Orf106, EIF2S3, HMGA1, IFITM3 and SERPINH1), as identified by DIANA-mirExTra (Alexiou et al. 2010). Collectively, these data suggest that let-7 miRNAs inhibit HeV by suppressing host proteins required for virus infection. Cross-referencing results from the protein-coding screen study showed that the majority of verified target genes for miR-181 and miR-17-92 miRNAs (proviral in the miRNA screen) were predominately antiviral, demonstrating a level of congruency between miRNA and protein-coding gene screens.",

Currently, there is requirement for renewed research into the host immune responses to henipavirus infection and how competent immune responses may fight disease. A major challenge is to ascertain the molecular mechanisms of virus replication and immunity associated with protection to infection. The improved knowledge of functional genomics approaches and immune response to viral infection means that we now have the tools to further progress our understanding and knowledge. Nevertheless, this must be implemented to develop advanced infection control approaches.",
