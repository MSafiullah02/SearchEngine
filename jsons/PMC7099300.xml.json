This biggest WHO conference on public health since the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma Ata in 1978, produced the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health. The declaration identifies five key action areas, to: adopt better governance for health and development; promote participation in policy-making and implementation; further re-orient the health sector toward reducing health inequities; strengthen global governance and collaboration and monitor progress; and increase accountability. The Rio Political Declaration clearly focused on the \u2018how\u2019 to implement action on the social determinants of health.",

By turning unfavorable into favorable societal conditions, public health work contributes to broader societal goals.

This has been documented throughout the past century by work on social determinants of health, and unites the public health pioneers with those from other sectors. As both problems and solutions are systemic, public policies are centrally important. Empirical evidence shows that work to decrease health inequities is most effective when undertaken at different levels and by targeting policies and policymakers. For instance, in many countries, transport and housing policies are most effective at local levels; fiscal, environmental, educational, and social policies work best at the national level; and financial, trade, and agricultural polices have best impacts at the global level.",

Effective public health needs to tackle both domains. However, less attention has been paid to equipping public health practitioners with the right skills to address the latter. Addressing structural determinants of population well-being requires a new approach to inter-sectoral collaboration4 and necessitates that public health professionals participate early in policy processes. Some of the new responsibilities for public health practitioners include:\nUnderstanding the political agendas and administrative imperatives of other sectors.Creating regular platforms for dialogue and problem solving with other sectors.Working with other arms of government to achieve their goals and, in doing so, advance health and well-being.",

The story of John Snow, one of the British Public Health pioneers, illustrates the professional spirit in which public health should be pursued:\nBy talking to local residents [John Snow] identified the source of the [Cholera] outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street [in London]. Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a sample of the Broad street pump water was not able to conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle. Snow later used a spot map to illustrate how cases of cholera were centred around the pump. He also made a solid use of statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the source of water and cholera cases. He showed that the water company was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames and delivering the water to homes with an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study can be regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology. It was discovered later that this public well had been dug only three feet from an old cesspit that had begun to leak fecal bacteria. A baby who had contracted cholera from another source had its diapers washed into this cesspit, the opening of which was under a nearby house that had been rebuilt farther away after a fire had destroyed the previous structure, and the street was widened by the city. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.6",

For instance, public health practitioners need to work with city planners to increase physical activity, and with local policy makers to create incentives for healthy food shops to open in areas with high prevalence of NCD's. At the national level, public health professionals need to work with agriculture, food, and consumer protection personnel to advocate for making healthier food the easier \u2013 and therefore the normal \u2013 choice. Globally, public health officers need to better understand the agendas of the global retail industry and establish a dialogue with the industry on how to make food a resource for health.",
