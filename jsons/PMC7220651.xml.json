The week-long course begins with an interactive three days in the classroom followed on the fourth day by a field activity whereby participants are taken to a clinical trial site for a mock inspection. The course participants then report back their findings from the mock inspection on day 5. The course has been typically offered once a year, as part of a clinical trial package along with clinical trial authorization and clinical data evaluation for registration courses.",

Although the face-to-face and online courses have great deal in common, there are important differences in objectives, learning activities, tools, and technologies deployed in the two courses. This paper describes how the move from a face-to-face course to an online authentic learning environment was accomplished and concludes with a discussion of design principles derived from the EDR process.",

For example, one of the primary design principles delineated by Herrington et al. (2010) is that authentic tasks should be seamlessly integrated with assessment.

By contrast, the online course presents the content components more broadly and delves into details through engagement in authentic tasks.

Nonetheless, some activities were possible to be integrated into both course modalities. For example, in the \u2018Introduction to GCP Principles,\u2019 a card game requires participants to match a total of 14 GCP principles with 14 corresponding applications of these GCP principles. In the face-to-face course, the game is played with cards attached to the wall and participants matched 14 cards in small groups. Then, each group is visited by the other groups and facilitators, and the results were discussed. In the online version, we added more challenge in that anytime the participant made a mistake in matching, he/she lost everything that have been correctly done before, thus forcing them to start again. This matching activity in the face-to-face course takes 30 min, however, in the online course, the time is not prespecified although learners must complete it within 2 days.

All participants who stayed with the course found that the course structure and communication were not difficult, however, remaining challenges are being addressed to provide professional development both for mentors and course participants:Time management: The participants preferred to take the course when at home. They faced difficulty engaging with the course and completing online assignments when at work or while travelling on professional missions. Time periods were suggested for each task according to its complexity and whether the task involves individual or group work. The course manager sent reminders about deadlines regularly.Internet access: The biggest concern was the poor access to the Internet. Given that the participants in the online course primarily come from developing countries, this will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future.Time gap between countries: The time difference among the participants varied from 1 to 8 hrs depending on their location. This time gap complicates organizing groups. In order to change the grouping from module to module, time differences were taken into account, however, there were cases where bigger gaps were inevitable.Language barrier: For most developing countries, English is not a first language. Therefore, it takes time to understand tasks. The online course uses quite simple language to ease the comprehension. Some sections were rewritten based on the comments received from beta-course participants for the coming courses. The course also provides ample time for discussion. Mentors contact participants if there are delays in the submission of their work.Different levels of knowledge and experiences: Differences in expertise and experience can hinder active participation if some participants feel they are not up to the task due to less experience and or believe that they are unable to complete assignments. Collaborative learning was used to support \u201cthe more knowledgeable other\u201d notion (Vygotsky 1978). Mentors were also active in communicating with participants and scaffolding their interactions whenever needed.Protection to subjects\u2019 (in clinical research) privacy and confidentiality: We had to modify all records used in the major authentic task in order to protect the subjects, without eliminating the authenticity of the real clinical research. It was a formidable task in terms of number and volume of documents to be modified as well as introducing different level of mishaps in various documents.Anxiety associated with technologies such as recording video, online discussion, online submission, teleconference, video conference: Ideally, the mentors can help low tech participants engage in the effective use of all technologies and encourage participants to practice tech skills on their own. However, our experience shows mentors are often not as confident in their tech skills as we expected, and thus more experienced mentors must also help other mentors who may be still learning to use some of the platforms and tools.",
