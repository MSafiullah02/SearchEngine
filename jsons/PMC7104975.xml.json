IBV is primarily a respiratory pathogen because it replicates mainly in epithelial cells of the trachea, resulting in respiratory signs (sneezing, cough, tracheal rales, gasping and nasal discharge), which are the most frequent clinical manifestation of this disease (Raj and Jones, 1997). In some cases, field strains of IBV can associate with renal and reproductive infections, producing severe nephritis, and causing severe damage to the oviduct and result in decreased or permanent loss of production and poor egg quality (Balestrin et al., 2014). The virus is transmitted by the air-borne route, by direct contact via the respiratory tract from infected chickens, which may travel several kilometers or indirectly through mechanical spread, such as contaminated feed and drinking water, equipment, eggs, working personnel and trucks (Cavanagh et al., 2002).",

Some studies have indicated that this divergence in serotype, due to the frequent point mutations and recombination events in the S1 gene, results in the emergence of new IBV variants that can be partially or poorly neutralized by existing vaccine serotypes (Liu et al., 2003). For this reason, the analysis of the S1 gene is the most useful strategy to differentiate IBV genotypes and serotypes, because it correlates closely with the serotype and permits the selection of the appropriate vaccinal serotypes for IB control in each geographic region (Jackwood, 2012).",

In Africa, IBV is one of the main and the most important viral respiratory diseases of chickens; it is considered an epidemic virus and widely spread both in vaccinated and unvaccinated poultry farms (Ahmed, 1954, Jackwood, 2012, Khataby et al., 2016). It was described and recognized for the first time in North Africa, especially in Egypt since 1950s (Eissa et al., 1963), from birds showing respiratory signs and confirmed by Eissa et al. (1963), in Morocco in 1983 (El Houadfi and Jones, 1985), in Tunisia between 2009 and 2013 (Bourog\u00e2a et al., 2009), in Libya in 2012 (Awad et al., 2014), and in Algeria (Sid et al., 2015). Antibodies against the IBV were reported from South Africa with 43% of IB prevalence in QwaQwa (Thekisoe et al., 2003), 86% in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe (Kelly et al., 1994), and in Botswana (Mushi et al., 2006). Up to now little is known about the distribution and impact of IBV in sub-Saharan African countries including Ivory-Coast. IBV revealed with a seroprevalence of 84% in Nigerian poultry farms (Ducatez et al., 2004, Owoade et al., 2006), and 72% in Ivory-Coast (Kouakou et al., 2015). Besides, two years later, in Burkina Faso, Tarnagda et al. (2011) confirmed during a study on avian diseases [avian influenza virus (AIV), IBV and Newcastle disease (NCDV)] in domestic and wild birds in highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks areas that the prevalence of IBV was 3.9% and no co-infection by AIV, IBV, and/or NCDV was found.",

Indeed, a large number of IBV variants in Egypt were recognized and strains related to the Massachusetts (Mass) D3128, D274 and 4/91 genotypes have been detected at different poultry farms in Egypt (Abdel-moneim et al., 2002, Sediek, 2010). Subsequently, the Egyptian variants \u201cEgypt/Beni-Seuf/01\u201d isolated from H120 vaccinated broiler flocks, and Israeli variant \u201cIsrael/720/99\u201d, represent a new IBV genotype that is suggested to be assigned as Egypt/Beni-Seuf (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2006). Around the year 2012, five IBV isolates formed a distinct phylogenetic group with the \u201cEgypt/Beni-Suef/01\u201d variant (Var1), and designate that \u201cCk/Eg/BSU-2/2011\u201d and \u201cCk/Eg/BSU-3/2011\u201d can be considered a new IBV variant (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012). All the IBVs variants circulating in Egypt during 2012 were classified into two variant groups; the first group was clearly variant from \u201cIS/885\u201d strain and the second group was related to as 4/91 and CR/88121 variants vaccine strains (Selim et al., 2013). Other Egyptian variants have also been isolated, named \u201cIBV-CU2-sp1\u201d and \u201cEg/12120s/2012\u201d (Afifi et al., 2013, Arafa et al., 2013).",

Subsequently, several reports confirmed the IBV strains related to the Massachusetts and to 4/91 genotypes have been detected at different poultry farms in Morocco (Alarabi, 2004, El Bouqdaoui et al., 2005). Recently, an epidemiological survey showed the emergence of a novel strain of Italy02 serotype with a prevalence of 32%, co-circulating with two serotypes; Massachusetts and 4/91, with a prevalence of 66% and 2%, respectively, that are isolated from vaccinated and unvaccinated chicken flocks (Fellahi et al., 2015a). In addition, three unique IBV isolates \u201cIBV/Morocco/30\u201d, \u201cIBV/Morocco/38\u201d, and \u201cIBV/Morocco/01\u201d were characterized using partial S1 sequence analysis, and revealed only a few changes in amino acid composition of S1 protein, thus forming a distinct cluster with the Spanish isolates of the Italy 02 genotype, and the author suggests that a new genotype, represented by the three new IBV isolates described, has been circulating in Morocco since at least 2010 (IBV/Morocco/30) (Fellahi et al., 2015b). This seemed the case for Tunisia, three IBV variants nominated as \u201cTN20/00\u201d, \u201cTN200/01\u201d, and \u201cTN335/01\u201d isolated from different Tunisian poultry farms, were very different from the Mass H120 vaccinal strain, but closely related to Mass types found in Europe such as D274 and CR88121 serotypes (Bourog\u00e2a et al., 2009). In addition, two other new Tunisian IB variants \u201cTN296/07\u201d, \u201cTN556/07\u201d isolated during 2007\u20132010, were also very distant from the reference IBV serotypes, in particular the H120 strain Bourog\u00e2a et al., 2009, Bourog\u00e2a et al., 2012).",

S1 gene analysis demonstrated that the IBV variants designated as \u201cIBV/Libya/8-2012\u201d, \u201cIBV/Libya/1-2012\u201d, \u201cIBV/Libya/7-2012\u201d and \u201cIBV/Libya/3-2012\u201d in Libyan broiler flocks, formed a separate cluster with the Egyptian strains \u201cCK/Eg/BSU-2/2011\u201d, \u201cCK/Eg/BSU-3/2011\u201d and \u201cEg/1212B\u201d, and the isolate named \u201cIBV/Libya/5-2012\u201d formed another cluster, with 100% relatedness to \u201cEg/CLEVB-2/IBV/012\u201d and \u201cIS/1494/06\u201d strains. In the other hand, new IBV variants were recently identified in Algerian poultry farms called \u201cAlgeria/26/b1\u201d, \u201cAlgeria/26/b2\u201dand \u201cAlgeria/26/b3\u201d, that are different from the strains isolated in neighboring countries, and this could suggest the existence of a new IBV genotype in North Africa. In Western Africa, a novel variant \u2018IBADAN\u2019 has been described between 2002 and 2007 in Nigeria and Niger, and referenced genome is \u201cNGA/A116E7/2006\u201d, which is antigenically and genetically different to other known IBVs (Ducatez et al., 2009). Some serotypes of IBV, such as Qx-like virus which it is highly pathogenic, continues to be a problem in many countries, and there is evidence that it has emerged for the first time in South part of the African continent (Zimbabwe) (Toffan et al., 2011). Meanwhile, two different isolates of IBV, \u201cCkZa/5315/11\u201d and \u201cCkZa/4916/11\u201d, were identified in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) during 2011\u20132012 (Knoetze et al., 2014).",

The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of these African IBVs were blasted and compared with the reference strains emerged in different African countries (Table 2). The pair-wise comparison (Table 2) and the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) of highly variable regions HVR1 and HVR2 sequences, revealed that these IBV viruses can be classified into two distinct groups: Group I consisted of six IBV variants of three clusters (cluster of Morocco, Algeria and Nigeria), which included Moroccan-G/83, Algeria/26/b1, Algeria/26/b2, Algeria/26/b3, NGA/293/2006 and NGA/A116E7/2006, these variants belong to 4/91, Mass strains (Ma5 and M41) and Qx-like. IBV variant \u201cMoroccan-G/83\u201d which is closely related to 4/91 (Jones et al., 2004), has a nucleotide sequence identity of 76%, 76.9% and 78.3% with Algeria/26/b1, NGA/293/2006 and NGA/A116E7/2006, respectively. Besides, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences identities of Nigerian isolates with others from the neighboring countries, like Algeria and Morocco, was ranged between 75% and 79%, and between 70% and 77% when compared to Algeria/26/b1 and Moroccan-G/83. Moreover, these low identities found between these variants, revealed that the cited countries don\u2019t have commercial exchanges of poultry or contaminated birds migration. Group II consisted of three clusters of the especially variants of Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco, which most of them had a close relationship with H120 and Italy02 strains (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3\n). The cluster of the Tunisian variants including TN296/07 and TN556/07 genotypes appeared to be very closely related to TN200/01 with highest nucleotide and amino acid TN556/07 identities of 85.3% and 71.6%, but the TN200/00 was branched separately from all Tunisian variants with 75.6% of nucleotide and 71.6% amino acid identities. These variants, when compared to the Egyptian variants, show a nucleotide sequences identities ranged between 74% and 79% and an identity of 68\u201380% in amino acid level. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree demonstrates that the Egyptian and Tunisian isolates, were closer to Mass H120 than Italy02 serotype, this was also confirmed by the pair-wise comparison of the deduced proteins sequences (80.5%) (Fig. 4\n).",

However there are some areas semi-conserved, the Phenylalanine in position 108 muted to Aspartic acid, the Aspartic acid in position 112 transferred to Tyrosine, however the Tyrosine in position 137 muted to Asparagine, and Serine number 208 to Proline, Phenylalanine number 212 to Leucine, Cysteine 218 to Arginine, another the Arginine 222 transfer to Tryptophan.",

In general, the obtained data revealed that the most frequently detected IBV variants in Africa were related to Massachusetts serotypes. Whereas, the African IBV variants that are classified distantly to the Massachusetts genotype are related to other strains such as, Italy02 type detected for the first time in Africa (Morocco) and Qx-like genotype South part of the African continent (Zimbabwe). Also the IBV variants reported in Africa, display a low genetic relationship between them and with the majority of the reference strains emerging in neighboring countries, except the case of variants from Libya and Egypt that show a high relatedness. This finding is confirmed by the protein sequence alignment that shows high diversity in the type of the mutations occurring in many residues (data are available but not shown).",

There was an evolutionary pressure to escape the ancestral state, namely the positive selection pressure. This is explained by the ability of the virus to change the protein to escape the host immune recognition and at the same time retaining the functioning of the protein and the active sites which can locate this region despite its hypervariability.",

It is sometimes necessary to develop specific vaccines to control the disease, when the commercial vaccines fail to give an adequate protection against the emerging variants virus.

These variants circulating and evolving in Africa since several years are still not studied enough in the genetic and antigenic levels. Besides, the pathotype variation and dynamics of genotypes within time for a specific region in Africa need as well to be investigated. In brief, all these analyses of partial S1 gene sequences of IBV variants circulating in Africa that are mentioned in this paper, revealed a possible dissemination of IBV between the neighboring countries, but little is known about the mode of IBV spread. However, cross-border movements of poultry and poultry-related products are likely an important factor. With these considerations in mind, the topic of how to type this large number of IB found in various countries, and relate this to the best vaccination strategy to use to protect against them is clearly complex.",
