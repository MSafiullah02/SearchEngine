            "text": "Since December 2019 a novel a coronavirus identified as SARS-CoV-2 or COV2 has been spreading around the world. On the 16th of May around 4.5 million people got infected and over 300,000 died due to the infection of COV2. The effective treatment remains a challenge. Targeted therapeutics are still under investigation. The papain-like protease (PL Pro ) from the human SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a cysteine protease that plays a critical role in virus replication. Its activity is required to process the viral polyprotein into functional, mature subunits. Moreover, COV2 uses this enzyme to modulate the host's immune system to its own benefit. Therefore, it represents a highly promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. In this work, we discovered that ebselen, a synthetic organoselenium drug molecule with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective activity in mammalian cells and cytotoxicity in lower organisms, is a highly active inhibitor of PL Pro CoV2. We proved that ebselen is a covalent, fast-binding inhibitor of PL Pro CoV2 exhibiting a low micromolar potency. Furthermore, we identified a difference between PL Pro from SARS-CoV-1 (the corona virus which caused the 2002-2004 outbreak, SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 that allows to explain the difference in dynamics of the replication, and, thus, the disease progression. Namely, we present that they show differences in the binding affinity of substrates that we observed through kinetics and molecular docking studies. Using a novel Approximate Bayesian Computation method we were able to find kinetic constants for both enzymes. Molecular modeling study on the structure of the active site and binding mode of the ebselen with SARS and COV2 showed also significant differences that could explain our observation that ebselen is less active and slower bounding with SARS than COV2. In conclusion, we show that ebselen inhibits the activity of the essential viral enzyme papain-like protease (PLpro) from SARS-COV-2 in low micromolar range.",

Two of the most promising are Papain-like protease (PL Pro ) and Main protease (M pro , also known as chymotrypsin-like protease 3CL pro ) [6] [7] [8] . These proteases play an essential role in polypeptide processing during virus replication. PL pro , in addition to being crucial during replication via processing of the viral polyprotein [9] , is proposed to be a key enzyme in the sustained pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. This includes deubiquitination [10] (the removal of ubiquitin), and deISGylation [11] (the removal of ISG15) from host-cell proteins. These last two enzymatic activities result in the antagonism of the host antiviral innate immune response [12] . As a result, PL pro is an important potential target for antiviral drugs that may inhibit viral replication and weaken dysregulation of signalling cascades in infected cells that may lead to cell death in surrounding, uninfected cells [8] .",

Deep analysis of the active site of and mechanism of catalysis of coronaviruses PL pro led us to conclude that small molecules with planar phenyl moieties, which also are able to modify cysteine residue active site, could be effective ( Figure 1 ). PL pro from coronaviruses belong to the peptidase clan CA (family C16). The active site contains a classic catalytic triad composed of Cys-His-Asp. We analysed the active site and the mechanism based on the crystal structure of PL pro from SARS-CoV-1 published by B\u00e1ez-Santos et al. in [8, 26] that showed PL Pro SARS has a catalytic triad composed of Cys112-His273-Asp287. This catalytic triad transforms the -SH group from cystine into a strong nucleophilic ion that attacks the carboxylic group of peptide bonds and leads to hydrolysis (Figure 1 (left) ). The side chain sulfur atom of Cys112 is positioned 3.7 \u00c5 from the nitrogen in position 1 of the imidazole ring in catalytic histidine (His273). One of the oxygen atoms of the side chain of catalytic aspartic acid (Asp287) is located 2.7 \u00c5 from the nitrogen in position 3 of the same histidine (Figure 1 ). The side chain of Trp107 that is located within the oxyanion hole. The indole-ring nitrogen was proposed to participate in the stabilization of the negatively charged tetrahedral transition state of the reaction intermediates produced throughout catalysis [8, 26, 27] .",

Progress curves (Figures 2A and 2C ) at different levels of substrate concentration showed an interesting difference between two enzymes. PL Pro SARS catalyzed the reaction faster and achieved saturation. We estimated kinetic parameters of hydrolysis of Ub-AMC (Table 1) using the recently published novel Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) computational tool for calculating kinetic constants in the Michaelis-Menten equation [28] . This extremely useful framework gives us the opportunity to find the turnover number ( k cat ), the Michaelis Menten constant ( K M ) and, as a consequence, the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme ( k cat / K M ) without using high concentrations of Ub-AMC ( Figures 2B and 2D) . The catalytic efficiency ( k cat / K M ) is often used as a specificity constant to compare the relative rates of reactions. Here we show that this ratio is three times higher for PL Pro SARS compared to PL Pro CoV2 that indicates its higher capability to hydrolyze Ub-AMC. PL Pro is required for the processing of viral polypeptides and to modulate the host's immune response, the higher efficiency may well contribute to the fact that once infected, SARS-CoV-1 was overall more aggressive and the disease developed faster.",

Ebslen appeared to be an irreversible inhibitor of the studied PL Pro SARS as well, although in this case inhibition was weaker and the kinetics of binding was slow (Table 2) . Irreversibility seems to confirm our first assumption that the inhibition of both enzymes can be associated with covalent bonds between Se from ebselen and S from cysteine. We confirmed irreversibility via dialysis and attemption of reactivation of the enzymes. The inhibitors were screened in TRIS buffer. The release of the fluorophore was monitored continuously. The linear portion of the progress curve was used to calculate the velocity. Each experiment was repeated at least three times and the results are presented as the average with standard deviation.

The most preferable conformation shows that the molecule occupies the same intersection between catalytic Cys111-His272-Asp286 triad and Trp106 but is additionally wrapped by other amino acids (Tyr268, Ala289, Leu298). Here, we identified a different binding mode where the Se -phenyl is directed to the oxyanion hole and Trp106, not N -phenyl as it was observed for PL Pro SARS. The Se -phenyl (from ebselen fragment) and an indole (from Cys322) formed \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, while face-to-edge stacking interactions were observed with an aromatic ring from Tyr 268. The N -phenyl ring of ebselen adopts a bent-shaped conformation that fits well to the space between Leu298 and Ala288 forming \u03c0-alkyl interaction with them. The smaller distance between the oxyanion hole and ligand as well as more interactions with amino acids surrounding the active site in PL pro CoV2 could explain a better binding affinity observed in our experiments.",
