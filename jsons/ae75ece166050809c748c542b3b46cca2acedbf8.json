            "text": "In addition to the cancellation of routine surgeries like joint replacements, sports surgeries and spine surgeries, the decrease in trauma surgeries as a result of reduction in road traffic accidents has led to a significant drop in the volume of surgeries performed by our department. This substantial reduction in the surgeries, and the resulting decline in admitted patients has led to decreased resident requirement. At present, majority of our surgeries are either for oncology patients or for those who experience low energy fractures such as hip fractures. As a result, only one or two operating teams are required per day. Therefore, our residents have been divided into multiple small teams who are assigned duties on a rotational basis (Figure 1) . Each team comprises of senior and junior level residents so that 1-2 operating rooms can be run efficiently every day without overcrowding in the operating rooms. The same team is also sufficient enough to manage patients in ward and emergency department. Apart from this working team, residents in other teams are advised to stay home though they are available 24X7. Methods have been detailed to regroup the (General surgery) residents into teams to minimize patient contact and prevent transmission between the teams 4 . However, the regrouping strategies described by the aforementioned authors do not mention about decreasing the overall resident workforce, and do not involve specific teams for COVID-19 duty. We believe that having a separate team which is involved only in COVID-19 duty prevents transmission between residents, and also protects transmission to orthopaedic patients. Although a national level lockdown at a relatively early stage might have slowed the transmission in India, considering its density of population, an explosive rise in cases post lockdown cannot be ruled out and warrants escalation of preparations. Therefore, we have redistributed residents in a manner that 50% of the residents can be allocated for COVID-19 duty at any time without compromising the orthopaedic care, and safety of patients.",

Since our department does not manage sick patients, our residents are posted with the screening team at our COVID-19 clinics. Other departments which provide critical care such as Anaesthesia, Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Medicine and Emergency Medicine are involved in managing the COVID-19 ward and intensive care units, with assistance from our residents if required. Orthopedic Residents in the COVID-19 team are usually posted for a period of about two weeks after which they are quarantined for 14 days 1 . This policy not only restricts resident exposure to COVID-19, but also limit the transmission from residents if they become infected. AIIMS like many other hospitals have shut down outpatient services. Although this has limited our ability to serve new patients it has not compromised our follow-up care. Patients who have been recently operated and need to have their suture/staple removed or wound inspected are still being seen in our examination rooms in the ward or operating complex as our out-patient blocks are closed. Residents posted in the ward or operating room see the respective patients and discuss with the consultants as required. Moreover, every day residents make telephone calls to patients who already had an appointment with us in the outpatient department. Majority of their concerns could be addressed through telephone, and wherever not addressed, patients were advised to report physically.When feasible and required, patients were also given the opportunity to discuss about their orthopaedic problems using video interaction and images. Many hospitals across the world are already redistributing their residents to manage the pandemic. Sarpong et al. 2 reported the experience of orthopaedic residents and attending physicians posted in the emergency room of their hospital in New York, which had become the epicentre of COVID-19. Rahman et al. 3 described how their residents were involved in a prone-positioning protocol to minimize the physical burden on their medical colleagues.",
