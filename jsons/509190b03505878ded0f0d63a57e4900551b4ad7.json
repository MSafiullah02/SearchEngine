If animal studies of influenza indicate that statins are protective, investigators should explore the molecular effects of statins in influenza virus-infected cells. Cholesterol synthesis is essential for the normal functioning of cell membranes, especially lipid rafts [66] . Cholesterol is also essential for influenza virus assembly, budding from raft-derived microdomains, and virus infectivity for other cells [67] [68] [69] . Experimental studies in mice have shown that Toll-like receptor 7, which is located in the endosomal compartment of the cell, recognizes single-stranded influenza virus RNA [70] . Once recognized, Toll-like receptor 7 recruits several adaptor molecules (e.g., myeloid differentiation protein 88 [MyD88]) that, through a series of signalling steps, lead to the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus, an essential event in establishing influenza virus infection [71] . The \"MyD88-dependent pathway\" controls gene expression for several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b), type 1 in-terferons, plasmacytoid dendritic cell maturation, and antiviral immunity [70] . These and many other intracellular signalling cascades have been identified in cells infected with influenza virus [72] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 220, "end": 224, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 497, "end": 501, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 642, "end": 646, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 647, "end": 651, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 652, "end": 656, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 832, "end": 836, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1123, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1354, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1476, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "LABORATORY AND CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE STATINS/ INFLUENZA HYPOTHESIS"}, {"text": "One of the most important intracellular signalling pathways involves influenza virus-induced caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis.
