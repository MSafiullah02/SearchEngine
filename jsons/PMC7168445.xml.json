According to the 2014 World Health Organization report, over 36.9 million people are living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.2 The most recent estimate indicates that hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronical infection of approximately 3% of the world's population.3 In addition to those two viral pathogens, humans also constantly encounter threats from many other emerging and reemerging infectious, zoonotic and devastating viruses, such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N14 and H7N95), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV),6 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV),7 Ebola virus (EBOV),8 and so on. Given the high mutation rate of viruses and their serious threat to public health, there is a high urgency to develop new antiviral drugs to combat these pathogens. Natural products in the roots, stems, barks, leaves, fruits, and seeds of plants have been used as herbal medicines to treat diseases for more than 3000 years in China. They also have played a significant role in modern drug discovery by serving as prototypes of novel drugs. As mentioned by Newman et al.,9 it has been estimated that over 49% of clinically used antitumor drugs from around the 1940s to the end of 2014 are natural products or their derivatives. Natural product\u2010derived drugs have also been crucial for antiviral drug discovery. From 1981 to 2014, over 40% of antiviral drugs in clinical use are natural products (\u223c6%) or designed using natural products as prototypes (\u223c34%).9\n",

And many new compounds are being discovered in plants, animals, and fungi every year.10 Most of them exist in nature as free acids, as esters with fatty acids, ferulic acid, etc., or as triterpenoid saponins linked with one or more sugar chains. They are often the main active constituents of many important medicinal plants, such as the ginsenosides in Panax ginseng, glycyrrhizin in Glycyrrhiza uralensis and saikosaponins in Radix Bupleuri.11, 12, 13 Triterpenoids display a variety of structures with nearly 200 different skeletons known from natural sources or enzymatic reactions, although many are variants of a smaller number of common structural types.14 Many pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs) show a wide range of pharmacological activities, and some are marketed as therapeutic agents or dietary supplements.15 Structurally, PTs have four six\u2010membered rings called A, B, C, D with ring E being five\u2010membered or six\u2010membered. Based on the carbon skeleton, they are divided into six common subgroups: oleanane, lupane, ursane, friedelane, hopane, and gammacerane (Fig. 1).",

Under the catalysis of squalene epoxidase, squalene is biosynthetically oxidized to 2,3\u2010oxidosqualene and various cyclic products, yielding the dammarenyl, lupenyl, and baccharenyl cation intermediates that eventually give rise to three major products namely: lupeol, \u03b1\u2010amyrin, and \u03b2\u2010amyrin, respectively (Fig. 2).17 Many PTs have a hydroxyl group at C3, a 12\u2010ene and a carboxylic acid at C17 or C20. The structural diversity of PTs provides a unique group of agents with a variety of pharmacological activities,18 including antiviral, antitumor, immunomodulatory, anti\u2010inflammatory, and hepatoprotective activities. Presently, the newly discovered PTs are a subject of annual review, reflecting the increasing importance of this class of compounds.18 The available reviews cover the chemistry,19, 20 antitumor activity,21, 22, 23 anti\u2010inflammatory activity,24 bioavailability,25 and other pharmacological activity.18\n",

In Japan, Stronger Neo\u2010Minophagen C\u2122 (SNMC), a preparation containing glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic acid, 1) has been used in the treatment of chronic hepatic diseases for over 40 years. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA, 2) (Fig. 3), a PT derivative of the \u03b2\u2010amyrin type, is obtained from the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin 1, which is isolated from the herb liquorice and shows inhibition on a variety of viruses including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV.26 In 1989, saponin B1 and B2, two oleanane\u2010type triterpenoids isolated from soybean seeds, have been reported to have activity against HIV at concentrations greater than 2 and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively.27 Three years later, Chen et al. reported that salaspermic acid (3), another oleanane\u2010type triterpene derivative isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii, can block the replication of HIV in H9 lymphocytes (IC50: 10 \u03bcM).28 Afterwards, Fujioka et al. found that betulinic acid (BA, 4), isolated from the leaves and barks of Syzigium claviflorum, also showed significant activity against HIV (EC50: 1.4 \u03bcM).29 Since then, more and more natural PTs have been reported to have antiviral activity. It is well known that lipids, a class of hydrophobic biomolecules, are important for cellular life, especially during virus entry into the host cell. It was reported that the promiscuous antiviral activities of natural PTs might be related to the effect of lipid metabolism.30, 31\n",

The CC50 values of compounds 4 and 66 were >100 \u03bcM. The SI of compound 66 was 180, indicating that it effectively inhibited viral replication without obvious cytotoxicity. The two compounds were further tested through inhibition assay toward 3CL protease. Compound 4 demonstrated valid inhibitory effect on 3CL protease function with an IC50 value of 10 \u03bcM, and its K\ni value was 8.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcM, indicating a competitive inhibition mode of action. However, the IC50 of 66 was >100 \u03bcM. Computer docking analysis revealed that 4 was able to occupy the binding pocket of SARS\u2010CoV 3CL protease. Moreover, the binding was enhanced by the formation of a hydrogen bond between the C3\u2010OH of 4 and the C = O of Thr24 of the 3CL protease. On the contrary, 66 did not form other intermolecular bonds with the pocket besides the hydrophobic interaction. Their anti\u2010SARS activity could be the result of a combination of two different antiviral mechanisms. One is via protease inhibition and the other is via blocking SARS\u2010CoV entry at the post binding step during the fusion of virus particle to host cell membrane, which is also an important and general antiviral mechanism of PTs.",
