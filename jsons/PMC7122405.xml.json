As infectious diseases in that part of the world were overcome by increased public hygiene, food safety, vaccinations and proper antibiotic treatment if necessary, there seemed no need for further attention. However, a number of events has attracted public and political awareness for new and re-emerging zoonoses such as the rapid spread of SARS in 2002 (Peiris et al. 2003), West Nile virus throughout the United States (Shephard et al. 2006), the outbreaks of avian influenza in South East Asia, but also in Europe (Shortridge et al. 2003) with varying types (H5N1, H7N7) leading to human casualties which alarmed public health authorities in many countries.",

A traditional approach to deal with zoonoses is to use a template including the biology of the germ, epidemiology, disease in humans and animals, diagnosis, and prevention or control of the disease. Often it means a mere enumeration of zoonoses found in dogs without further going into relative health risks for dog owners or the population at large through environment pollution (Tan 1997). Depending on the endemicity of particular zoonoses in certain areas of the world more attention may be paid to these (e.g. echinococcosis and toxocarosis, Carmena and Cardona 2013; Desplazes et al. 2011)",

Responsible pet ownership also means that dog owners should realize that the other half of the population have no dogs or may even not like dogs. Annoyance about dog faeces in the streets or noisiness is common. Dog owners can contribute to public discussions in communities to show their attitude to regular deworming or parasite control, health certificates and to clean up the faeces of their dog while walking. It is surprising to see the differences between dog owner\u2019s attitudes in various countries in Europe.

A major issue of spreading zoonoses with dogs is transport from endemic areas to non-endemic areas. In the EU without borders such transports only require mandatory health certificates, signed by an official veterinarian, and proper vaccinations (e.g. rabies). Rabies, Echinoccocus granulosus and Leishmania are in many countries therefore \u2018imported\u2019 infections. Import of canine babesiosis (not a zoonosis) and probable settlement in Western Europe including its vector (Dermacentor reticulatus) are a clear sign of dragging off zoonoses (Daugschier 2001). Harmonization of parasite control in Europe has taken place by the independent organization ESCCAP (www.esccap.org) in order to enable veterinarians to inform clients about the differences of endemic diseases in the various European countries and how to prevent contracting or importing infectious diseases when traveling with dogs (holidays, animal assisted-dogs) or purchasing dogs from abroad. Obviously, this is not only of value regarding parasitic infections, but also for bacterial or viral zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, rabies), however, comparable informative websites for veterinarians do not exist yet. Transports from dogs originating from Eastern Europe (Romania, Bulgaria) and Mediterranean countries (Spain, Italy) for commercial enterprise to the Northwest of Europe increase the spreading of unwanted and unexpected zoonoses to non-endemic areas such as cystic echinococcosis (Carnena and Cardona 2013). The shifting frontier lines from the South (e.g. Leismania) and Middle Europe towards\nWestern and Northern Europe (e.g. E. multilocularis) also suggest changes of habitats whether or not supported by climate change. On the ESCCAP website these changes are regularly updated.",

Because E. multilocularis easily grows in dogs the threat of spreading it to owners is also realistic. Monthly deworming in endemic areas is strongly recommended (Hegglin and Deplazes 2013). Moreover in areas with raccoons and raccoon dogs in wildlife in large parts of Europe a new threat is the appearance of Baylisascaris spp. in dogs, too.
