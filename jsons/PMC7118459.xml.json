In another study that he conducted years later, Variend described CMV parotitis findings in 40 out of 112 infants as well as microglial nodules in the brain and lymphocytic infiltration findings in the liver and kidney.11 Variend emphasized the necessity to employ more precise methods for future diagnosis of CMV infections at the end of that study.11 In the present study, a microglial nodule was observed in the brain tissue of a case diagnosed with encephalitis, and also CMV-DNA was found positive in the tonsil and brain tissues of the case (Fig. 5\n). CMV-DNA was demonstrated in the tonsil tissue as the salivary gland of the case was not sampled during the autopsy.",

Moreover, the demonstration of CMV-DNA and other infectious agents in SUDI cases with clinical history and/or histopathological findings of CMV infection would significantly clarify the cause of death.14 Post-mortem molecular investigations are useful in explaining the cause of death in SUDI with a suspicion of infection in forensic autopsies. Multidisciplinary studies with the participation of microbiologists, pathologists and forensic medicine experts would obviously contribute for further detection of the cause of death in such cases.29\n",
