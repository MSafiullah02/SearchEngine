Benchmarking based on the increase in total cases or case fatality rates is one way of comparing performance across countries or territories (such as states in the USA), and could inform policy decisions about COVID-19 mitigation strategies. But comparing cases and fatality across territories is challenging due to heterogeneity in testing and health systems. We show two complementary ways of benchmarking across countries or US states. First, we used multivariate regressions to estimate the test-elasticity-of-COVID-19-case-incidence. We found a 10% increase in testing yielded ~9% (95% CI:4.2-13.4%; p<0.001) increase in reported cases across countries, and ~2% (95%CI:0.1-3.4%; p=0.03) increase across US states during the week ending April 10th, 2020.",

But CoVID-19 case counts depend on lab-confirmation, so the number of reported cases is a function of testing [6] . Benchmarking may thus be of limited use because countries or even states within the USA do not have the same testing policies or test availability for SARS-CoV-2 [5] . Comparing fatality rates, which may be comparatively easier than comparing CoVID-19 incidence, is also challenging. To illustrate, the case fatality rate in China, adjusted for underascertainment, demography, and censoring (deaths lag infection), was estimated at ~1.4%. Still, the crude case fatality rate adjusted only by censoring was ~3.7% [7] .",

A purist would argue one cannot compare countries or territories with different levels of testing without random sampling. Acknowledging these limitations, we took a pragmatic approach to suggest two relatively simple ways of comparing territories, such as countries or US states, with varying degrees of testing. First, we used multivariate regressions to estimate the test-elasticity-of-CoVID-19-incidence, that is, the proportional increase in testing of CoVID-19 and in reported cases (both in logarithms). Our results were robust to various model specifications.

Figure 1A shows a consistent association between the increase in testing per capita and reported CoVID-19 cases by country (\u03b2=0.86; 95%CI: 0.57-1.15; p<0.001). In other words, a 10% increase in testing was associated with a ~9 % increase in reported cases. Considering that a test elasticity=1 was included in the 95% confidence interval, we cannot reject that growth in weekly cases was fully proportional to increase in testing. By contrast, Figure 1B shows that for the US states, the test-elasticity of cases was substantially lower (\u03b2=0.17; 95%CI: 0.03-0.31; p=0.02), suggesting that the evolution of CoVID-19-case-growth in the US was largely driven by changes in PTR rather than testing. We get larger elasticities, more comparable to the global sample, when excluding outlier states in the USA and focusing on the same range of testing growth (\u03b2=0.54, p<0.0001, 95%CI: 0.36-0.71; Online Resource, Figure S1 ). Table 1 are consistent with the findings in Figure 1A for the cross-country sample. With and without regression controls, we get point estimates for the elasticity around 0.85-0.88 (p-value <0.001; columns 1 through 3). A 10% increase in testing yielded about 9% (95% CI: 4.2-13.4%; p<0.001) increase in reported cases. Moreover, changes in testing explained about 40% of the variance in cases for our regressions (r 2 =0.41) and adding health expenditures, population, days since the 100 th CoVID-19 case, and share of the population \u226570 years of age with chronic respiratory disease added little explanatory strength to the model (r 2 =0.46). We obtained similar results for case fatality rate, but in the opposite direction (Table 1 , columns 4 through 6). We found a test-elasticity-of-casefatality slightly above minus one (\u03b2=-0.89; column 6). A 10% increase in testing yielded about 9% (95%CI: -12.2--5.6%; p<0.001) decrease in case fatality rates, with covariates adding limited explanatory strength (r 2 =0.45). To test robustness, we re-ran the regression with the most recent available data (April 11 th through April 17 th ); results were largely consistent. We found an elasticity for reported cases of \u03b2=0.77 (95%CI: 0.23-1.30; p=0.01; r 2 =0.43, column 3), and \u03b2=-0.77 (95%CI:-1.40--0.14; p=0.02, r 2 =0.18, column 6) for case fatality rates (Online Resource, Table   S2 ).",

As in Figure 1B , the magnitude of the elasticity was smaller for reported cases (\u03b2=0.18) and case fatality rate (\u03b2=-0.16). A 10% increase in testing yielded about 2% (95%CI: 0.1-3.4%; p=0.03, r 2 =0.25, column 3) increase in reported cases, and ~2% (95%CI: -3.1--0.2; p=0.03, r 2 =0.14, column 6) decrease in case fatality rates (only significant with controls). R 2 was smaller for regressions comparing US states than countries globally. Elasticities for US states using the most recent data available (April 11 th through April 17 th ) showed some qualitatively similar results. We found a test elasticity of \u03b2=0.17 (95%CI: 0.08-0.27; p<0.001, r 2 =0.29, column 3) for reported cases, and \u03b2=-0.15 (95%CI: -0.30-0.01; p=0.06, r 2 =0.12, column 6) for case fatality rates, though the latter was not significant at \u03b1=0.05 (Online Resource, Table S3 ). shows both testing and PTR remained the same as the previous period. Figure 2 shows four quadrants where countries would fall when they increased or decreased in either testing or PTR. When both testing and PTR grow (quadrant I) or decrease (quadrant III), or countries o states move along the y-axis (change in PTR) or x-axis (change in tests), weekly change has a straightforward interpretation. But for quadrants II and IV, the net effect in cases is not obvious. To aid interpretation, we plotted a downward sloping line that represents the zero-case-growth (i.e., where \u0394 ln + \u0394 ln = 0; hence \u0394 ln = \u2212 \u0394 ln ). Countries or states above the line increased case growth in the past week; those below the line have decreased case growth. Case growth in most countries moves in complex trajectories. The distance to the zero-case growth line is a visual clue for the overall increase in cases.",

On the other hand, countries like Ecuador (ECU) and Israel (ISR) appear on top of the line, meaning that growth in COVID-19 cases was approximately the same as in the previous week (\u0394 ln = 0). Notably, this null change in case growth is accounted for by different levels of testing. In the graph, Israel decreased reported testing but increased the positive rate in the same proportion.
