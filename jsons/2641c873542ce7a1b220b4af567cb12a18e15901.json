Exact etiology of KD remains unknown, though various hypotheses on the role of micro-organisms and superantigens have been postulated. 2 The principal features that constitute the diagnostic criteria are predominantly mucocutaneous. However, as KD is a vasculitis, it can involve several other organ systems including musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, genitourinary, and pulmonary. 2, 3 A proportion of children with KD may occasionally present with unusual clinical features (atypical KD), or may have fever in the presence of less than four principal clinical features (incomplete KD). 4 The initial presentation may, at times, point toward a different disease but the child may develop KD during the course of illness.
