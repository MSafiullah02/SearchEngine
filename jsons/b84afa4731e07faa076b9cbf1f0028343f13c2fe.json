Swift control measures and etiological investigations were conducted by the Chinese government, physicians and researchers, and by using high throughput sequencing and virological testing, the mysterious pneumonia pathogen was shown to be a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) capable of person-to-person transmission (Zhu et al., 2020) . Coronaviruses are a group of non-segmented, enveloped and positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the subfamily of Coronavirinae in the family of Coronavirdiae and order of Nidovirales. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, six coronaviruses have been documented to be able to infect humans. Of them, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are the most well-described coronavirus as they were responsible for two large-scale outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, with 8,096 cases infections and roughly 10% mortality and 2,494 cases and 34.4% mortality, respectively (Cheng et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2015) . Until the moment of manuscript submission, coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to over 25 countries globally and caused over 59,000 cases with 1,316 people dead already ( http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCov/). Furthermore, there are still over 16,000 cases suspected in 31 provinces in China. Although these suspected patients are mostly quarantined in specialized hospitals or self-quarantined at home, a timely, effective and accurate diagnosis for those people is of pivotal importance for alleviating the already overwhelming medical system and preventions of further expansions. In this study, a fast and reliable multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method (multiplex rapid detection kit 2.0, Uni-MEDICA Tech, Shenzhen), which can simultaneously detect 15 respiratory tract infection pathogens including the SARS-CoV-2, was employed to screen the pathogen agents in the patients. These 15 respiratory pathogens are the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A/B (FluA/B), coronavirus NL63 (NL63), coronavirus (229E), parainfluenza virus type 1/2/3(PIV1/2/3), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (hRV), human bocavirus (hBov), coronavirus HKU1 (HKU1), coronavirus OC43(OC43), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The sensitivity and specificity of this method have been evaluated by the kit manufacturer Uni-MEDICA Tech, and the minimum detection limits for those 15 respiratory pathogens of this kit were between 100 copies and 1,000 copies per microliter.

In Shenzhen city, all SARS-CoV-2suspected patients or patients with a high possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection were eventually transferred and admitted into the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen. Most of these patients were admitted into this hospital in the first week after the onset of symptoms, and the first set of samples (sputum, nasal or throat swab) were collected immediately upon admission. A re-sampling was included for in-parallel testing analysis one day later after the first sampling. A total of 186 random patients' specimens collected from January 20th to February 1st in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen were subjected to out testing.

Detailed individual characteristics for these patients including age, gender, days after onset, clinical feature, chest CT, and chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases and blood routines are summarized in Supplementary file 2 in Supporting Information. A close examination of the medical records of these patients revealed that most of them (155 cases, 83.3%) had an epidemiologic risk including residence or traveling history to Wuhan and its nearby cities, or had a contact with patients having respiratory disease symptoms or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections from endemic areas in the past two weeks, indicating that most of the suspected cases were originally exported from the endemic regions into Shenzhen city.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dear Editor,"}, {"text": "Using this multiplex kit, we confirmed that 92 patients (49.46%) were infected by the SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) . When compared to the testing result using the National Medical Production Administration authorized GeneoDx kit instead, we found that the total 88 individuals of SARS-CoV-2 infections detected by the GeneoDx method were also all exactly identified in the multiplex approach testing (Supplementary file 3 in Supporting Information). The RT-PCR products for the four more cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections detected in the multiplex approach were further sequenceverified (Supplementary file 5 in Supporting Information). The chip-square and Fisher's exact test were employed to compare the difference between these two methods, and no statistically significant difference was detected for them These results together suggested that this multiplex panel approach can not only serve as a sensitive and reliable tool for identifications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community but also help the physician to remove the common respiratory pathogen infection cases from the suspected or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection categories. This removal of non-infected cases will help to relieve the current pressures of hospitalizations and isolations for those patients, and further alleviate the following requirements for epidemiologic investigation and contact tracing, thus saving the current extremely limited medical and human resources. Intriguingly, in the 92 SARS-CoV-2 (49.46%) positive patients, the common respiratory viruses RSV, hRV, hMPV, PIV2 and HKU1 were also simultaneously detected in six patients (3.2%) respectively, of which four patients (2.2%) were positive for at least two detected viruses (Supplementary file 4 in Supporting Information). The co-infections in these six patients were further verified in our parallel testing using a second-day sampling from the same patients. As far as we know, this is the first solid evidence for the co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses in patients although it remains conceivable.

Furthermore, among the 131 (70.4%) patients who fulfilled all of the clinical signs and epidemiologic risk of SARS-CoV-2suspected cases, 64 (34.4%) were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
