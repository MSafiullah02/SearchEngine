As cases increased and required healthcare, healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recognized as a high-risk group to acquire the infection due to the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2] , that may lead to a broad and changing spectrum of clinical disease, recently including olfactory and taste disorders. Despite this, there are few reports in healthcare workers [3, 4] , also about the occurrence of anosmia and dysgeusia [5] .",

All the HCW then needed to use the contact and respiratory precautions when attending patients with respiratory symptoms or/and flu-like illnesses in all areas with presumed ongoing community transmission of COVID-19 in most countries [4] . In a case series of 138 patients treated in a Wuhan hospital, 40 patients (29% of cases) were HCWs [3] . Among the affected HCWs, 31 (77.5%) worked on general wards, 7 (17.5%) in the emergency department, and 2 (5%) in the intensive care unit (ICU), then in any area HCWs would be exposed and infected. Our case also presented with, a still considered novel, the clinical manifestation of COVID-19, the anosmia persisting for more than two weeks, and more prominent than other common clinical findings reported in this infection (e.g., fever, cough) [5] . Olfactory and taste disorders are well known to be related to a wide range of viral infections, although not a high proportion of patients. Multiple viruses can use the olfactory nerve as a shortcut into the central nervous systems, including the influenza virus, and cause even long-term olfactory disorders in some cases [6] .",
