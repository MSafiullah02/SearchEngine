            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) represent a major public health problem worldwide, a leading cause of human acute illnesses and an important contributing factor of childhood morbidity and mortality, especially in children under 5 years [1-3]. A majority of ARIs in children have a viral etiology, probably due to absent or incomplete immune protection, sustained viral shedding and high transmissibility amongst hosts [4]. Amongst a variety of RNA and DNA viruses that can infect the respiratory tract, Human Rhinoviruses (Picornaviridae family) [5], are recognized as the most prevalent in all age group worldwide [6]. Together with coronaviruses, they represent common causative agents of upper respiratory tract (URT) infections, traditionally defined as common cold [6,7], and thus a major cause of school and work absenteeism since children experience 8\u201312 and adults 2\u20133 URT episodes per year, on average [8]. Children are the major reservoir for HRV [9]. The mean age at the first symptomatic HRV infection is 4\u20136 months (vs >6 months for other viruses such as RSV [10]; more than 90% of children have experienced at least one HRV infection by the age of 2 years [11]. HRV infection is most often associated with a non-specific, self-limiting illness with clinical manifestations ranging from an asymptomatic presentation to fever, rhinorrhea, cough and wheezing. However, HRV infections are increasingly involved in otitis media, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in infants, elderly and immunocompromised patients [12,13]. In addition, HRV represent a major viral aetiology of asthma exacerbations, with the highest incidence of all respiratory viruses in adults and children >2 years of age (60\u201365% of viral exacerbations) [14,15]. Although suspected in some studies, there is at the present day no proof of association between clinical severity and HRV species [16-20]. Altogether, these data highlight the predominant role of HRV as a respiratory pathogen especially in early life.",

Rhinoviruses share with Enteroviruses an identical genomic organization and have similar functional RNA secondary structures, but differ in their acid tolerance, receptor usage, and cell tropism [21]. The genome is approximately 7.2 kb long, and is composed of a 5\u2032non-coding region (5\u2032NCR), followed by a long open reading frame coding for four structural icosahedral capsid proteins (VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1), and seven non-structural proteins 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D, and terminated by a short 3\u2032UTR and poly A tract. HRVs are highly heterogeneous genetically and antigenically [22,23]. More than 140 serotypes have been described, and these fall into three species, HRV species A (HRV-A; 74 serotypes), HRV-B (25 serotypes) and a novel genetically distinct third genotype HRV-C, comprising 49 designated serotypes recognized in 2006 [24-27].",

As clinical presentation is non-specific, it devolves to the diagnostic laboratory to confirm the presence of HRVs [41]. Detection of HRV by culture is slow and complex for HRVA and HRVB, whilst HRVC has been unculturable in vitro to date [23]. Serologic diagnosis is virtually impossible due to the number of serotypes, and rapid antigen test kits are not available [4]. Molecular methods such as real-time RT-PCR appear to be the most suitable method, combining short analysis time, high sensitivity, semi-quantification of viral load and the detection of the majority of respiratory viruses with multiplex methods [42-44]. Most of the published systems target the 5\u2032NCR. However, the high genetic diversity of HRVs makes the detection of all variants difficult as evidenced by the alignment of available GenBank 5\u2032NCR sequences. Indeed, a comparison of published HRV-specific PCR primers pairs showed that no single pair could detect all HRVs [45] and that more than one PCR is required for accurate description of HRV epidemiology.",

In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses [50]. Accordingly, much better characterization of the epidemiology of ARIs is still needed to improve understanding of the role of the different pathogens and of bacterial-viral interaction in the pathogenesis of ARIs.

First, it is obvious that a proportion of samples truly infected by HRVs could not be detected using the Taqman probe test. This is evidenced by a number of probe-negative/BOXTO positive and probe-negative/SYBR green positive samples for which the presence of HRV amplicons was confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR products. This phenomenon was shown to be highly reproducible and the same HRV positive samples were repeatedly detectable or undetectable using the probe-based assay (data not shown). Since all assays used the same amplification primers, the most likely explanation is a default in probe hybridisation. Analysis of the genomic sequence of HRVs that could not be detected by the probe-based assay showed that only a limited proportion of strains had mutations in the probe hybridisation region. Other mechanism(s) must therefore take place to explain the default of hybridisation of the probe. A possible explanation may lie in the highly structured form of the rhinoviral 5\u201dNCR, which contains an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). On the one hand, the probe hybridisation region itself is located in a stem-loop region, and on the other hand mutations in different parts of the NCR may modify the secondary structure of the genomic RNA molecule and possibly limit the access to the probe hybridisation region, as previously reported [51]. This is, to our knowledge a rare example of inefficient probe-based detection that is not related to mutations in the probe hybridisation genomic region.",

Ideally, the probe-based detection and the intercalating agent-based reaction should be performed in the same reaction tube and detected in distinct reading canals. This is what was attempted by combining a FAM-TAMRA labelled probe and BOXTO. This system allowed the detection of a proportion of probe-negative samples, but the proportion of false positive results was so high that the use of this assay is not possible for clinical or epidemiological purposes (unacceptably low estimated specificity and positive predictive values). It remains from this experiment the important information that a significant proportion of Taqman-negative samples provided true positive results using the same primers and the BOXTO intercalating agent. Accordingly, we tested a number of BOXTO-positive samples using a standard Taqman assay and (separately) a standard SYBR green assay. The SYBR green assay was able to provide positive results in probe-negative samples, which, contrary to what was observed with BOXTO, were all confirmed by direct sequencing of amplicons, indicating that the SYBR green assay is associated with high specificity and positive predictive values. However, the assay failed to detect a few probe-positive samples. Finally, we investigated a new experimental procedure by combining the SYBR Green and a Texas-Red labelled probe. Preliminary experiments on 30 respiratory samples showed that the level of interference between Texas red-based and SYBR Green-based detections in a combined assay was lower than previously observed in the case of the couple (FAM-Boxto), but still an obstacle to routine use: (i) in 13samples testing negative using the probe or the SYBR Green alone, a combination of Probe + SG provided 11 P-SG- samples and 2 P + SG- samples (e.g., 2 false positives in 13 negative samples tested, which is too high for diagnostic use, but much lower than with the couple FAM-Boxto (circa 75%)); (ii) in 17 samples testing positive using the probe or the SG alone, the combination of Probe + SG provided 16 P + SG + samples and one P-SG + sample. The mean detection CT was slightly increased when detection was performed in the presence of SYBR Green and this was sufficient to make negative using the combined assay one sample that tested positive using the probe alone.",

Besides the possible utilisation of distinct pairs of primers to adequately cover the natural genetic diversity of HRV isolates [46] our results suggest that the optimisation of the detection of amplicons produced by primers is an important issue. In our hands, a SYBR green-based assay was slightly more sensitive that a Taqman probe-based assay and constituted the best compromise amongst the techniques tested. Attempts to associate a probe-based detection with an intercalating agent-based detection should be renewed to identify a reliable couple (DNA dye/probe label) that could be used for routine diagnostic and epidemiological detection of human rhinoviruses.",
