On the other hand, the findings on DWI in our patients bear some similarity to the typical multifocal and patchy appearance of acute cerebellar infarction.39 Hence, we postulate that at least some of the findings in our patients with small, multifocal involvement of the gray matter of the vermis and hemispheres may be more consistent with cerebral infarction rather than direct infectious cerebellitis.

As it reports only the initial MRI findings on admission in patients enrolled in SNIP in an ongoing infectious outbreak, comparison with a nationally co\u2010ordinated database of cases (S. Kalimuddin, unpublished data) affecting the CNS, heart, and joints would be useful. GBS infection can be classified according to serotypes (I to IX), and initial studies suggest that this outbreak associated with consumption of raw freshwater Song fish (bighead carp) and Toman fish (snakehead), was associated with Streptococcus agalactiae serotype III, specifically sequence type (ST) 283.40 This potential food\u2010borne zoonotic source had previously been reported to cause severe disease in farmed fish in Asia, and further study is needed to determine virulence factors of the bacteria which could account for the severity and relative incidence of complications, as well as the pathological features and source of the outbreak.7, 8, 41, 42 Because meningitis and cerebral infarction have been previously reported to be associated with poor prognosis, follow\u2010up studies of our patients will also be needed, as would comparison of MRI features of meningitis caused by GBS and other organisms.26 Nevertheless, our initial findings demonstrate that some patterns of MRI features that may be useful to alert clinicians and radiologists to the novel GBS CNS infection outbreak involving Streptococcus agalactiae Serotype III.",
