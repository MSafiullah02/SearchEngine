            "text": "According to the latest definition by the World Health Organization, probiotics are live micro\u2010organisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host (FAO/WHO 2001). Probiotic treatment aims to direct the composition of the microbiota from potentially harming to a microbiota that would be beneficial to the host. Probiotics can be used as means of prevention by reducing the risk for overgrowth of potential pathogenic bacteria, thus suppressing colonization by the latter (Ouwehand et al. 2002). They also aim to restore lost bacteria or metabolic activities in colonized organs or to stimulate the immune response (Kalliomaki and Isolauri 2003). Probiotics have been shown to be beneficial at different sites of the human body \u2013 oral cavity, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract and urogenital tract. They have well established positive effects in the treatment of diarrhoea, including antibiotic associated and traveller's diarrhoea, vaginitis and functional gastrointestinal disorders [for review see (Allen et al. 2010; MacPhee et al. 2010; Girardin and Seidman 2011)]. Nowadays, various probiotic strains are commercialized with the aim to prevent or to treat these types of diseases. Human clinical trials and animal studies have shown that probiotics could have broader applications and they could also be used to prevent, to treat or to relieve symptoms in cases of caries, periodontitis, allergies, atopic disease, respiratory infections, otitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, colorectal cancer, acute gastroenteritis, lactose intolerance and cystitis [for review see (Stamatova and Meurman 2009b; Stamatova et al. 2009a; Ozdemir 2010; Gupta 2011; Meijer and Dieleman 2011; Yu 2011)].",

Their action can be directed at the host, the pathogen or both. Probiotics may modulate the host's innate or acquired immune response by products like metabolites, cell wall components and DNA, or they may increase intestinal mucin production (Mack et al. 1999). They may produce substances that inhibit pathogens \u2013 low\u2010molecular\u2010weight substances, low\u2010 and high\u2010molecular\u2010weight bacteriocins, antibiotics and microcins (Oelschlaeger 2010). These beneficial bacteria can also exert direct, mechanical effects on pathogens. These mechanical properties allow them to antagonize and to compete with them without affecting the metabolism neither of the host, nor of the pathogen. Competition involves adhesion, binding sites, nutrients and space (Lepargneur and Rousseau 2002).",

Adhesion ability also allows probiotics to compete with pathogenic bacteria for binding sites (Lepargneur and Rousseau 2002). If they bind to the same receptor and the affinity of the probiotic is higher, it has the ability to displace the pathogen. Furthermore, adherent probiotics occlude the access of recently arrived pathogens to the epithelium and thus exert competitive exclusion (O'Toole and Cooney 2008). Size can also be an important factor. Large\u2010sized probiotic bacteria could exert better competitive exclusion of pathogens than small\u2010sized ones by masking specific receptor sites for pathogenic micro\u2010organisms on the cell surface by steric hindrance (Merk et al. 2005). Competition for nutrients results from the depletion by probiotics of nutrients from the environment that would otherwise be available for the pathogens. Additionally, they may bind and render unavailable to pathogens limited substances, such as iron (Oelschlaeger 2010). Probiotics and pathogens also compete for space that is essential for the multiplication of all micro\u2010organisms (Alvarez\u2010Olmos and Oberhelman 2001).",

Through auto\u2010aggregating or co\u2010aggregating with other probiotics, an adequate mass is achieved which is necessary for these micro\u2010organisms to manifest their beneficial effects (Collado et al. 2007). Aggregation also enables the formation of a barrier that protects the host's epithelium from colonization by pathogens. Moreover, the ability to co\u2010aggregate with a pathogen allows the probiotics to entrap it (Boris et al. 1998; Re et al. 2000).",

URTIs include rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, rhinopharyngitis, also called the common cold, pharyngitis, epiglottitis and laryngitis. We have also included otitis in this review. Even though otitis does not affect the respiratory tract, infections of the upper respiratory tract can extend to the ears through the Eustachian tubes. URTIs can have viral or bacterial origin. The most common viruses causing URTIs are rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza and influenza viruses. Among the bacteria causing URTIs, the most frequent pathogens are group A streptococci, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamidia pneumoniae, Corynebacterium diphteriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Bourke 2007). In the case of pharyngitis, the origin of the infection is viral in 15\u201340% of cases in children and 30\u201360% of cases in adults. Bacterial origin accounts for 38\u201340% of cases in children and 5\u201310% of cases in adults (Pichichero 2007). URTIs of bacterial origin are commonly treated by antibiotics. As mentioned earlier, however, antibiotherapy presents drawbacks, especially the occurrence of resistant bacteria. An alternative method for the treatment of URTIs could be the use of probiotics.",

Trials conducted on subjects under heavy physical training, as well as trials employing synbiotics, were excluded. In vitro and animal studies have explained some of the mechanical properties and modes of action of the tested probiotics.

Prevention of infection or its treatment may necessitate different mechanical properties. In the case of prevention, probiotics should establish a microbiota capable to inhibit and/or block colonization by pathogens. In the case of treatment, however, probiotics will need to confront an already established population of pathogens. In both cases, aggregation and adherence are required properties for the probiotic. In the absence of pathogens, the probiotic would adhere to the host cells and protect them by blocking the access of pathogens. When a pathogen arrives, they could trap it by co\u2010aggregating with it and thus eliminate it. It is possible that probiotics do not confer complete protection against infection. However, they could help fight pathogens and thus reduce the duration and the severity of symptoms. In an already infected organism, a desirable ability for a probiotic is to exert competitive exclusion. A higher affinity for binding sites would allow them to exclude attached pathogens that could subsequently be eliminated through co\u2010aggregation. On the other hand, strong adherence to host cells would allow the probiotic to occupy any free space on the epithelial surface. Thus, they could slow down the multiplication of the pathogens by competing with them for space and nutrients. In the case of URTIs, most clinical trials are destined to prevent disease in the healthy population or to prevent recurrence in disease\u2010prone patients.",
