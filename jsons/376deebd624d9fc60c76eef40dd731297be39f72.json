We analyzed the climate temperature from various regions according to their current ongoing human-to-human transmission (OHHT) Q3 status. We studied 3 groups; Group 1, 10 provinces from China with majority of COVID-19 cases; Group 2, areas where continuous horizontal transmission outside of China had been reported; and group 3, areas where imported cases had been detected and no horizontal transmission had been documented after at least seven days since the first case was reported. The regions without OHHT showed significantly higher temperatures when compared to China and countries with OHHT, with over an 11-degree difference. The average rainfall during the study period was significantly higher in those regions without OHHT when compared to the Chinese provinces with OHHT and the regions with active transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings show statistically significant differences between regions with OHHT of COVID-19 cases compared to those regions without horizontal transmission. This phenomenon could have implications in the behavior of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in the following months. Currently more than 60 countries have been affected and almost 100,000 cases worldwide have been reported since the beginning of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) outbreak. 1 SARS-CoV-2 (taxonomic name of the virus causing COVID-19) has shown diverse disease severity, raging from asymptomatic to acute respiratory disease syndrome with a 1.4-2.3% mortality rate. 2, 3 While the outbreak has reached every region of the world except Antarctica, it is undeniable that countries in the south- * Corresponding author.",
