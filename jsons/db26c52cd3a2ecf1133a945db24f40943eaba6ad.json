There was minimal evidence that age was associated with disease severity, but males were significantly more likely to have severe disease biomarkers, and to die, Given the current cohort were already at an advanced disease state on presentation, one reason for their generally good survival rates is likely to be the real time Clinical Decision Support tool that enabled rapid escalation of treatments, particularly relevant since the commonest critical scenario was thromboembolic disease for which anticoagulation is available: It was recognised early that the thrombotic process was most amenable to preventative and early treatment strategies, and more recent data have emphasised this: Overall thrombotic complication rates in intensive care patients are now reported as exceeding 30% [13] [14] [15] . Recent data from severely affected patients suggest the coagulopathy is not consistent with acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and instead supports hypercoagulability together with a severe inflammatory state [16] . Additionally, autopsy series published in recent weeks highlight particularly the thrombosis of small vessels [17, 18] , and multiple groupings are now advising on how best to manage anticoagulation in COVID-positive patients [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Recognising evidence of microvascular injury [17, 18] , it is plausible that early, stratified intermediate prophylactic or full therapeutic anticoagulation, where appropriate, with heparin may have modified the disease process and led to improved outomes in our protocolised case series compared to all series [4-7; 12] , and low overall admission mortality rates for a cohort already at an advanced stage of disease. Furthermore, independent of heparin's anti-coagulant properties, it may exhibit important anti-viral properties. Lang and colleagues [24] have shown that heparin inhibits SARS-CoV infection in vitro and it has been shown to interact with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 causing conformational change, which may inhibit interaction with the ACE2 receptor and thereby block host cell entry [25] .",

The addition of an antioxidant in the form of ascorbic acid, for all patients admitted to hospital, could also have contributed to lower mortality in our case series. Although not shown to improve outcome in small sepsis [26] and ARDS [27] studies, there is growing interest in the use of ascorbic acid in sepsis [28] . Ascorbic acid has been shown to shorten the duration of the common cold and reduce hospital stay in influenza-A associated pneumonia. [29] In vitro studies have demonstrated that ascorbic acid enhances the proliferation, differentiation and function of lymphocytes, and stimulates interferon release, [30] which could enhance viral clearance.",

While we cannot discount such signals, the evidence was not strong in the current cohort. Instead the most striking feature was the male predominance-in ward admissions, in admission to AICU, for biomarkers of severe disease (especially CRP and ferritin that displayed no relationships with age), and for deaths. We are not the first to report male susceptibility to severe COVID-19 [1-7], but the evidence for susceptibility to all aspects, across all age-groups, is noteworthy.",

The presented biomarker data and excess mortality seen on AICU imply however, that even with the accelerated in-hospital care provided by the traffic light system, as a group, males are not benefitting as much as females. The nature of putative X-chromosome variants that modify the expression of the viral receptor are yet to be determined, thus for now we suggest that all males should be currently considered to be at higher risk.",

We found no evidence that age was associated with biomarkers of disease severity-in contrast these emphasised the males at risk. We suggest the presented protocols are adapted more widely. Earlier presentation of males to hospital is also encouraged, in efforts to prevent the pathophysiological deterioration to which they are biologically susceptible.",

Bold face indicates the more abnormal variable between the sexes, and for p-values, those meeting p<0.0001. Females were older, there was no difference in the percentage of males and females by ethnicity, but all dashboard variables tended to be more abnormal in males, particularly CRP (illustrated in main manuscript Figure 4) , ferritin, creatinine (p-values <0.0001); respiratory rate and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.0001). BP, blood pressure, SpO2, oxygen saturation, IQR, interquartile range. P values for sex calculated by Mann Whitney rank sum. * Age dependent, SpO2 normal low 92% (for older patients), normal high 98.5%.

A) Admission CRP values including 95% confidence intervals [CI] for males and females, and illustrating higher values in males that becomes less pronounced at older age as female ferritin tends to increase. C) Natural log-transformed Ddimer. Note there was again no relationship with age for females (95% CI not shown for clarity), but that D-dimer increased with age in males. However, the regression coefficient for ln (D-dimer) predicted an averaged increase in the order of 10ng/mL per decade which we considered unlikely to have a bearing on the values under discussion.",
