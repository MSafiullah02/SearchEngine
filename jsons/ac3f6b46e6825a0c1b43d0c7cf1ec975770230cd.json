It has also been associated with encephalitis recently by detection of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients presented with encephalitis. This retrospective study aimed to present clinical features of HBOV infections in children with respiratory symptoms and describe unexplained encephalopathy in a subgroup of these patients. Results of 1,143 pediatric nasal samples from mid-December 2013 to July 2014 were reviewed for detection of HBOV. A multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction assay was used for viral detection. Medical records of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. HBOV was detected in 30 patients (2.6%). Median age was 14 months (5-80). Clinical diagnoses were upper respiratory tract infection (n \u00bc 10), bronchopneumonia (n \u00bc 9), acute bronchiolitis (n \u00bc 5), pneumonia (n \u00bc 4), acute bronchitis (n \u00bc 1), and asthma execarbation (n \u00bc 1). Hospitalization was required in 16 (53.3%) patients and 10 (62.5%) of them admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Noninvasive mechanical ventilation modalities was applied to four patients and mechanical ventilation to four patients. Intractable seizures developed in four patients while mechanically ventilated on the 2nd-3rd days of PICU admission. No specific reason for encephalopathy was found after a thorough investigation. No mortality was observed, but two patients were discharged with neurological sequela. HBOV may lead to respiratory infections in a wide spectrum of severity. This report indicates its potential to cause severe respiratory infections requiring PICU admission and highlights possible clinical association of HBOV and encephalopathy, which developed during severe respiratory infection.

            "text": "Human bocavirus (HBOV) was first described in 2005 by Allender et al. [2005] in the nasopharyngeal aspirates of children with respiratory infection. So far, it has been frequently associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in many reports worldwide with a frequency ranging from 2.2% to 19% [Allander et al., 2007; Canducci et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2014] . Its role as an etiologic agent in respiratory infections has been supported by significant associations between HBOV detection and concurrent otherwise unexplained diseases and also significantly higher detection of the virus in symptomatic patients compared to asymptomatic ones [Kesebir et al., 2006; Brieu et al., 2008; Ghietto et al., 2015] . On the other hand, HBOV has also been associated with encephalitis recently [Mitui et al., 2012; Mori et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013] . It has been postulated that if HBOV is able to cause viremia it can also disseminate to other parts of body [Allander et al., 2007] . Therefore, researchers investigated the presence of HBOV in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the children presented with a clinical picture of encephalitis and detected HBOV in 3-15% of these patients [Mitui et al., 2012; Mori et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013] . In this retrospective study, clinical features of HBOV infected children admitted to pediatric emergency room of a tertiary referral center with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection are presented, with a special interest on a subgroup of patients complicated with unexplained encephalopathy during their disease period.",

Furthermore, the current kit have shown very similar performance to that of other three different multiplex PCR assays in a recent study, with 93-100% agreement for all comparisons [Anderson et al., 2013] . It is able to detect following 21 respiratory pathogens: Human bocavirus, influenza A, (including H3N2 and H1N1), influenza B, human rhinovirus, coronavirus NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) A/B, Mycoplasma pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus A/ B, adenovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus and has an internal control.",

They found no difference between HBOV single infection and co-infection in terms of clinical and laboratory findings, similar to the current study. Another similar finding was reported by Brieu et al. [2008] who showed lack of difference in severity between children co-infected with HBOV and RSV and those infected with RSV alone. A much higher co-detection rate of HBOV (78.1%) was reported in a recent study from Argentina [Ghietto et al., 2015] . They also stated that clinical features of patients with HBoV-single infection were not significantly different from those with co-infection. In the current study, the majority of co-infections of HBOV occurred with RSV, similar to some other reports in the literature [Wang et al., 2010; Ghietto et al., 2015] . They co-circulated in winter and spring in our study period, but not in summer. It may be speculated that there may be any other interaction between these two viruses. However, it is noteworthy that there are also studies reporting other viruses like rhinovirus and parainfluenza viruses as the most commonly co-detected viruses with HBOV [Ahn et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2015] .

In the studies with a similar setting, very low hospitalization rates have been reported [Chuang et al., 2011; ] . However, severity of illness was very remarkable in the current study: 43.3% of patients had radiologically confirmed bronchopneumonia/ pneumonia, 33.3% of patients required PICU admission, and 20% of the patients were mechanically ventilated. A study conducted by V\u20ac olz et al. [2007] indicated pneumonia and need for oxygen supplementation in the majority of the study group, but no administration of mechanical ventilation. On the contrary, in another study, only 2 patients were hospitalized among 22 patients with HBOV infection [Bharaj et al., 2010] .",

On the other hand, rhinorrhea, if present, was almost exclusively a sign/symptom of outpatients. The most common clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection, bronchopneumonia, and bronchiolitis. This spectrum of symptoms and diagnoses were in accordance with other reports defining HBOV and other viral respiratory tract infections [Brieu et al., 2008; Ghietto et al., 2015] . All patients were ordered a chest X ray and only one-third of chest X rays were normal. High rate of radiological investigation may be explained by relatively young age of the patients and presence of an underlying disease in most of them. Comorbidity was detected in 60% of our study group. It was associated with increased severity of the clinical picture caused by HBOV. However, in a recent study, comorbidity was found to be present in 31% of HBOV infected patients and no difference other than age of patients with comorbidities, which were older than previously healthy ones, was reported [Ghietto et al., 2015] . Recurrent wheezing was the most common preexisting medical condition in our patients (30%), and one patient had a history of asthma. This finding supports some studies in the literature, one of which reported a significantly high rate of preexisting wheezing and asthma episode in patients infected with HBOV, compared to HMPV and RSV [Brieu et al., 2008; Ghietto et al., 2015] .",

When differential blood counts were analyzed, it was noticed that neutrophilia and lymphopenia was significantly increasing as disease severity increases. Thus, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, a convenient marker of systemic inflammation, was significantly higher in patients admitted to pediatric wards and PICU. On the other hand, eosinophil counts were significantly decreased in hospitalized patients compared to outpatients. These findings are noteworthy, but we do not think that they are specific to HBOV infection, since their relation to increased disease severity was established for other diseases as well [Zahorec, 2001; Abidi et al., 2008] .",

            "text": "HBOV is associated with respiratory disease in vast majority of reports. Its association with encephalitis has been shown only by three reports [Mitui et al., 2012; Mori et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013] . Researchers investigated the presence of HBOV genome in CSF samples of children with signs and symptoms of encephalitis. They found HBOV in 3%, 5.8% and 15% (number of patients: 191, 69, and 67, respectively) of patients with encephalopathy. HBOV viremia have been documented previously [Allander et al., 2007] . Mitui et al. [2012] detected HBOV genome also in the serum of one study patient. They found that the sequence of the HBOV detected in CSF and the corresponding serum were similar. This finding may indicate that HBOV encephalitis was caused by hematogenous route of the virus [Mitui et al., 2012] . However, the disruption mechanism of blood-brain barrier is to be determined. It is currently not known that whether HBOV dissemination to the central nervous system is related to host immunological factors, or associated with viral mutations leading to altered cell tropism or pathogenesis [Mitui et al., 2012] . CSF pleocytosis and abnormal protein/glucose levels are not common findings in all three studies evaluating HBOV encephalitis [Mitui et al., 2012; Mori et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013] . Although normal or near-normal CSF findings may be expected in viral encephalitis, it may be argued that an impaired inflammatory response related to host may exist. Mitui et al. [2012] linked this issue to the malnourished condition of their study group. However, other studies have also reported HBOV encephalitis in well nourished children [Mori et al., 2013] . So, there may be other host related immunological impairments, unknown currently. In our study group, patients were admitted to hospital with respiratory sypmtoms. On admission, no signs and symptoms related to encephalopathy were present. However, in four patients, who were admitted to PICU because of severe respiratory disease, a clinical picture of encephalopathy characterized by seizures and decreased consciousness developed within first 2-3 days of PICU admission. We described this clinical picture as encephalopathy rather than encephalitis due to negative findings on CSF investigations and cranial imaging. They had pneumonia and HBOV was determined in their tracheal and nasal specimens by PCR method. They had no preexisting neurological or metabolic disease. They neither required resuscitation, nor exposed to ischemia. No specific reason for encephalopathy was found after a thorough investigation. HBOV genome could not be investigated in CSF samples of these patients. Based on these findings, it could be postulated that HBOV viremia developed in patients with pneumonia and hematogenous spread of HBOV to the central nervous system caused the encephalopathy in these patients. However, why these four patients suffered from such a severe pneumonia followed by encephalopathy and others not is remained to be elucidated.",
