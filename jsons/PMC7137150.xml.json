After methadone-maintenance treatment services expanded into a nationwide programme in August, 2006, the number of participants reached a plateau in November, 2008. Subsequently, the number of criminal arrestees using heroin (a schedule-I drug) in Taiwan fell below the number of criminal arrestees using schedule-II drugs (metamfetamine, methylenedioxymetamfetamine [MDMA], and marijuana) for the first time in August, 2009 and the trend has continued since (figure\n).12\n",

A project of Taiwan's Society of Preventive Medicine's Living with Hope Organization started HIV/AIDS-related group education for illegal drug-using arrestees in detention centres and prisons in November, 2004, when alarming signs of outbreaks of HIV-1 infection in injecting drug users appeared.5 Previous education focused only on the risk of sharing needles or syringes rather than dissolved heroin solution; hence, one focus of the education was to correct the unintended implicit message that sharing drug solutions is risk free. Later, this correction was widely disseminated by the Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control during the harm-reduction programmes. Some injecting drug users reported that the only risk factor for contracting HIV was sharing the dissolved heroin solution.8, 9\n",
