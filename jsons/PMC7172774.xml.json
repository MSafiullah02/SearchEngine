            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterised by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in pigs of all ages (Rossow, 1998). The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is a small, enveloped, RNA virus classified within the Arteriviridae family (Cavanagh, 1997). The viral genome consists of 15 kb long, linear, polyadenylated RNA that encodes nine open reading frames (ORFs). ORFs 1a and 1b encode proteins with replicase and polymerase activities, while ORFs 2\u20137 encode virus-associated proteins, of which the glycosylated protein GP5, encoded by ORF 5, is a major component of the virus envelope (Meulenberg et al., 1995). GP5 is associated with the development of neutralising antibodies and host protection (Gonin et al., 1999, Meulenberg, 2000, Ostrowski et al., 2002, Plagemann, 2004a, Plagemann, 2004b) and has been a key target in the design of novel vaccines that overcome safety problems associated with modified live vaccines (B\u00f8tner et al., 1997, Mengeling et al., 1999) and the limited efficacy of inactivated vaccines (Nielsen et al., 1997, Prieto et al., 1997, Scortti et al., 2007).",

However, despite the development of a large number of vaccine candidates, studies in mice or pigs have indicated that their use results in limited protection with, at best, partial reductions in viraemia and tissue viral loads. This lack of protection has been attributed to the induction of weak immune responses, which are usually insufficient to prevent infection after viral challenge, especially where this challenge is heterogeneous in character.",

Given that it is possible that neutralising antibodies play a role in the development of protective immunity (Osorio et al., 2002), it was interesting to note that none of the vaccinated animals in the present study developed detectable levels of such antibodies prior to challenge, and only two pigs had developed specific antibodies by day 42 p.v. Somewhat unexpectedly, more severe clinical signs, including respiratory distress and anorexia, were encountered in more of the vaccinated than in the positive control animals. Given this clinical presentation it was important to rule out confounding infection with PCV-2 (Quintana et al., 2001).",

One of the most commonly proposed mechanisms to explain such an adverse effect is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus replication, where non-neutralising antibodies induced by immunisation bind virus and enhance target cell infection, particularly of monocytes and macrophages. Such \u2018enhancing\u2019 antibodies have been demonstrated in the serum of PRRSV-infected pigs (Yoon et al., 1996), as well as in HIV-infected humans (Homsy et al., 1989), SIV-infected macaques (Montefiori et al., 1990), Visna virus-infected sheep (Jolly et al., 1989), and caprine arthritis\u2013encephalitis virus-infected goats (McGuire et al., 1986). Furthermore, non-neutralising, GP5-specific IgG against PRRSV has also been incriminated in increasing the level and duration of PRRSV viraemia (Yoon et al., 1996). Pirzadeh and Dea (1998), found more severe lesions in pigs challenged with a wild-type strain of PRRSV, that had been vaccinated with an E. coli GST-ORF5 recombinant fusion protein, and that had developed non-neutralising antibodies against GP5 at the time of challenge, than in non-immunised controls.",

Excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially interferon-\u03b1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin-1, has been correlated with lung pathology in the case of a number of viral infections (van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000). Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 production is linked to weight loss and systemic disease in the case of both respiratory syncytial and influenza virus infection (Hussell et al., 2001). Th-2 cytokine responses have also been implicated in immunopathological processes associated with bovine and human respiratory syncytial virus and Coxsackie virus infection (Boelen et al., 2000, Kishimoto et al., 2001, Kalina et al., 2004). Autoimmunity could also be involved as piglets infected with PRRSV can develop severe hypergammaglobulinaemia and lymph adenopathy (Butler et al., 2008). Further work will be required to assess if any of the above mechanisms are involved in the development of the adverse events described in the current study.",
