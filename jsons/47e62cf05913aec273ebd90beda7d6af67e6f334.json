In particular, we investigate whether investor attention-measured by Google searches-could help to improve the forecasting of Islamic stock returns. To this end, we used quantile regressions to examine the relationship over the period 2004-2016 in order to capture its evolution during calm and turbulent times. We thus investigated the effect of investor attention not only on the mean, but also for the different quantiles. Our findings highlight two important points. First, the relationship between investor attention and Islamic stock returns exhibits time-variation and nonlinearity as investor attention significantly impacts the dynamics of Islamic returns, but its sign and effect vary per quantile. Second, the usefulness of information provided by investor attention improves the forecasting of future Islamic stock returns.",

For example, high uncertainty can lead to more anxiety and panic for investors, subsequently creating more volatility on the financial markets (Jawadi et al. 2017) . The recent and ongoing risk of the Coronavirus epidemic, for instance, has made investors highly uncertain and anxious, and as a result, the French, German and US stock markets lost over 10% of their value in the last week of February 2020 and more recently, which are the highest losses since 2008. This recent occurrence illustrates the significant relationship between the stock market and investors' behavior, attention and attitude.",

In particular, we focus on the Islamic stock market in the US and its interaction with investor attention. Islamic finance emerged as an alternative form of finance in the aftermath of the global finance crisis in 2008. The huge losses experienced by investors resulted in severe criticism of the conventional financial system. This led to an increase in investors' interest in the Islamic stock market since the latter appeared to provide an investment framework that is more social, societal, ethical and less risky than the conventional financial system.",

The Shariah law regulations are based on specific rules, such as prohibition of interest rates, speculation and uncertainty; the sharing of both profit and loss; and greater transparency . However, investor interest in Islamic finance has mainly been observed in the last decade, especially during the severe downturns in the conventional financial investment markets, in the aftermath of the recent global financial crisis.",

            "text": "The relationship between investor attention and the Islamic stock market is particularly relevant since Islamic finance -at least from a theoretical point of view-has built its ethical investment rules in keeping with the principles of Sharia-compliant investors, while conventional investors or speculators might behave differently, sometimes embracing mispricing activities in order to maximize their profits. Accordingly, and given the presence of heterogeneous investors (Jawadi et al. 2017) , investor sentiment could impact the Islamic stock market differently depending on the actors who dominate the market. Indeed, the dynamics of the Islamic stock market may be galvanized in two ways: by pure drivers of conventional stock markets (unethical investors according to Shariah law) or investor attention, corresponding to the stabilizing actions of ethically principled investors. This paper proposes a new specification per quantile to model the dynamics of Islamic stock returns, taking into account the effects of investor attention. In particular, it enables us to further capture the effects of investor attention and interest in Islamic Finance for lower as well as higher quantiles. This specification has the advantage of capturing further asymmetry, nonlinearity and time-variation in the relationship between investor attention and Islamic stock returns. Further, unlike previous related studies, we proxy investor sentiment with a Google Search index using specific research and interest in the Islamic stock market, and we test its capacity to forecast future Islamic stock returns. Our findings show that investor attention has a significant impact on Islamic returns, and that investor attention helps to drive Islamic stock returns higher.",

While this model supplants the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) to explain stock return dynamics through information about firm size and market-to-book ratio in addition to market risk data (Gaunt 2004) , other empirical studies point to the presence of additional factors that might explain the dynamics of stock returns: time-varying investment opportunities (Petkova 2006) , firm profitability and investment (Fama and French 2015) , investor attention (Tang and Zhu 2017; Nguyen et al. 2019) , etc. 1 Nguyen et al. (2019) investigated the impact of investor attention on the dynamics of stock returns for five emerging countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) over the period 2009-2016. Using the Google search index to proxy investor attention, the authors showed that investor attention has a negative and significant effect on stock returns for the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, suggesting that investors might react more quickly to bad rather than to good news in their investment decisions. According to Calvo, investors in emerging markets are less rational and less informed and their strong interest could thus generate lower stock returns as they may overreact to negative signals.",

Both indexes covered the period January 2004-December 2016. We also used the conventional Dow Jones industrial stock index obtained from Bloomberg as a control variable, as well as the Islamic stock index. This is a particularly appropriate sample selection for analyzing the interaction between investor attention and the Islamic stock market both before and after the recent Global Financial crisis. The Islamic stock index was also obtained from Bloomberg and was set up using the closing daily stock price of the end of the month, while the investor attention index was set up using the number of Google searches carried out in the US with the keyword \"Islamic Stock Market\". This Google trend index thus captures the level and frequency of investor's attention with regard to the Islamic Stock market.",

Otherwise, the market attention index shows more volatility excess during the pre-crisis and the GFC periods, suggesting that investor attention in Islamic stocks rose during the most turbulent times, but stabilized in the last decade. The application of unit root tests shows that the Islamic stock index is integrated of one order (noted I(1)) in the same way as the conventional stock index, while the investor attention series is stationary. To better illustrate the dynamics of these two variables, Fig. 2 reports the means of two variables by season and suggests a time-varying dynamic for both series.",

Next, from the OLS(1*) line, we note that when we augment Eq. (1) with the associated effect of Investor attention on conventional US stock returns, even though investor attention still remains nonsignificant, the latter interacts with fundamental drivers and reduces the effect of conventional US stock returns on the Islamic one by 4%, in addition to its statistical significance. This suggests that higher investor attention to Islamic stock returns weakens the effect of the conventional financial system. Next, in order to characterize the effect of investor attention on Islamic stock returns, we investigate their relationship per quantile. We report the main results in Table 3 and note the various interesting findings. First, investor attention has a negative and significant effect on the low quantiles of Islamic stock returns, suggesting that for lower quantiles, investors are more impacted by bad news than by good news, although the higher the quantile, the lower the effect of investor attention. The memory effect in the dynamics of Islamic stock returns is negative and significant only for the quantile 2.5%. The effect of the conventional stock market is positive and significant, however, and higher than that of market attention. Further, when combining the impact of market attention with that of the conventional stock market, the effect on Islamic stock returns is positive, suggesting that for lower quantiles, Islamic stock returns are driven more by fundamentals through the effect of the conventional stock market than by market attention. Second, when looking at the relationship between investor attention and Islamic stock returns around the median, there is no evidence of a significant effect of investor attention. Third, for higher quantiles of Islamic stock return distribution, investor attention has a positive and significant impact, suggesting that for higher quantiles, investor attention, strengthened by good and positive news, might stimulate the level of Islamic stock returns.",

Our results show that while standard linear modeling fails to capture the effect of market attention, our quantile regression specification exhibits a significant effect of investor attention on the dynamics of Islamic stock returns. Interestingly, we show that the attention effect enters nonlinearity and has a time-varying impact on Islamic stock returns. Indeed, while investor attention might reduce the increase in Islamic stock returns around the low quantile, its effect is significantly more simulative around the high quantile. This suggests for higher Islamic stock returns, Islamic finance become more attractive and therefore more driven by investor's attention, as investors seek for highest benefits. Finally, we find that investor attention could help to improve the forecasting of future Islamic returns. This result is particularly interesting as the focus on investor attention, interest and sentiment may help us to better understand the evolution of Islamic stock markets and to analyze its trends.",
