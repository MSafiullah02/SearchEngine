The spectrum of COVID-19 has ranged from a mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe progressive pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death [2] . Older patients and those with a weaker immune system appear to have a greater risk of death [3] . Thus far, the vast majority of deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Italy, China, Iran, and Spain-all Northern hemisphere countries with good health care resources and a low HIV prevalence. After the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached sub-Saharan Africa, COVID-19 cases may expand more quickly in high HIV prevalence communities with poor health resources.",

Given the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa, it now seems likely that COVID-19 cases will occur in all sub-Saharan African countries (Fig. 1) . Perhaps what may be less certain is how SARS-CoV-2 will spread in HIV-endemic settings, and whether COVID-19 will have a higher morbidity and mortality rate among people living with HIV (PLHIV). In South Africa, where only 54% of the estimated 7.7 million PLHIV are virally suppressed and tuberculosis remains the leading cause of HIV-related mortality, these questions will need to be addressed.",

With no proven therapeutic options for COVID-19, the WHO recommends a \"Test, Test, Test\" strategy in response to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic.

The WHO has identified the development and evaluation of \"rapid point-of-care diagnostics for use at the community level\" as a top research priority [10] . Second, the mortality rate of HIV-associated TB has declined in part by initiating more PLHIV on ART. Starting ART may improve the immune response to COVID-19 for PLHIV, and may help prevent onset of Cytokine Release Syndrome or progression to severe respiratory failure. Third, the HIV epidemic led to crowded and overburdened health care facilities and hospitals. There is now a similar concern that COVID-19 will severely divert limited health care resources, which could reverse observed reductions in HIV and TB mortality in recent years. The public health response may need to incorporate additional COVID-specific resources, while still maintaining the supply chain of care and ART for PLHIV. With millions of PLHIV receiving ART throughout sub-Saharan Africa, perhaps the best way to protect this population from COVID-19 may be to ensure an uninterrupted supply of ART.",

Those most vulnerable to COVID-19 may be PLHIV who are either unaware of their diagnosis or not yet receiving ART. An important part of the response therefore will be not suspending the HIV 90-90-90 efforts during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, but to expand ART in order to protect PLHIV from severe COVID-19 disease. Since the response will require adequate health care infrastructure, integrating COVID-19 testing services within the HIV treatment infrastructure may be essential for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in sub-Saharan Africa.",
