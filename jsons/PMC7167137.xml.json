The addition of dextran to HSS prolonged the effects of this solution.10 This study showed that a combination of HSS + IES, without the addition of dextran, was able to correct severe dehydration in these calves (Tables 2 and 3). The disadvantage of using dextran, besides increasing the cost of treatment per calf, is that dextran can cause coagulopathy as well as an anaphylactic reaction.18 Hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia are common in calves with spontaneous diarrhea.5 Hypernatremia also is observed in calves with diarrhea, and is related to low plasma protein concentrations.5 In this study, fluid loss was isosmotic because chloride and sodium concentrations were unchanged after induction of diarrhea. However, Sen et al2 did not observe alterations in serum sodium or chloride concentrations when they evaluated calves with diarrhea caused by unknown factors. In calves with endotoxemia, the use of HSS causes increases in serum sodium and chloride concentrations, but this effect only lasts 60 minutes.9 According to Kaneko et al,13 most domestic animals tolerate greater sodium intake if they have adequate access to water. Animals treated with HSS ingested a larger amount of water after treatment compared with other groups, although it was not possible to quantify the amount. Hyperkalemia was observed in all animals after induction of diarrhea (Table 3). Similar results were observed by other authors who used saccharose and 3 types of diuretics to induce diarrhea and dehydration in calves.10 However, when only saccharose and furosemide were used to induce diarrhea and dehydration, there was no change in serum potassium concentrations.11 Hyperkalemia occurs by translocation of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space in response to low concentrations of sodium in the extracellular fluid, or as a compensatory mechanism for acidosis.4, 13, 14 This imbalance responds to rehydration by restoration tissue perfusion, decreasing extracellular potassium concentration, and correcting metabolic acidosis.4, 13 For rehydration to be effective, sodium concentration must be reestablished and Na, K\u2010ATPase can function at full capacity and carry potassium into cells.13, 17 All solutions were able to reduce hyperkalemia. The low potassium concentrations in animals treated with HSS are related to rapid expansion of the extravascular volume and a strong ion effect resulting in extracellular potassium exchange for sodium.4 Decreased potassium concentration after administration of HSS + dextran has been documented previously, but was not considered clinically important.8 Metabolic acidosis is a common finding in calves with spontaneous diarrhea.19, 20 In addition, the reduction in circulating blood volume associated with dehydration increases production of lactic acid (because of poor tissue perfusion) and limits the ability of the kidneys to excrete hydrogenous ions.3, 17 Severe acidosis also impairs control of brain volume, causing lethargy and coma.13, 14 Changes in acid base balance also were confirmed by a significant increased in anion gap values at Time 0. The anion gap is very useful in categorizing the acid base imbalances.13, 14 An increased anion gap is associated with metabolic acidosis caused by increase in the organic acids (lactic acid and ketoacids).13 Higher concentrations of l\u2010lactate were observed at Time 0 in all groups (Table 2).",

The mechanism by which the diuretic effect of furosemide is produced is by its direct action on renal tubular function. To correct hypovolemia, the body increases reabsorption of sodium. However, to maintain electroneutrality, the sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule must be accompanied by reabsorption of anions, such as chloride. Because the patient is hypochloremic, a greater amount of sodium reaches the distal tubule, where, under the action of aldosterone, hydrogenous ions are secreted to retain sodium. Renal excretion of hydrogenous ions is directly proportional to bicarbonate reabsorption, giving rise to metabolic alkalosis.22, 23 The main action of hydrochlorothiazide is to increase the urinary excretion of sodium and chloride.23, 24 Spironolactone acts as a specific aldosterone antagonist, primarily by competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone\u2010dependent sodium potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule.23, 24 Spironolactone therefore will antagonize the hypokalemic effect of furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide,23 but exert a weaker diuretic, natriuretic, and chloruretic effect than furosemide. In this study, the use of higher doses of saccharose, hydrochlorothiazide, and spironolactone caused diarrhea, dehydration, and metabolic acidosis. In the venous circulation, metabolic acidosis has a vasoconstrictive effect, which tends to centralize blood flow and predispose to pulmonary congestion. Acid base abnormalities frequently are present in sick calves.21 One of the main compensatory effects to decrease the degree of systemic metabolic acidosis is the urinary excretion of hydrogenous ions. Because of the state of dehydration, there is a prominent decrease in urine volume, substantially decreasing the elimination of hydrogenous ions, and responsible for the decreased blood pH.4, 17 The results demonstrate that treatment with IES and IES + HSS were effective in correcting metabolic acidosis by removing excess hydrogen ions, increasing renal flow and buffering by acetate. To be metabolized in the canine liver, acetate requires 2 molecules of hydrogen ions. In a study comparing the effects of oral rehydration with sodium bicarbonate or sodium acetate in calves with spontaneous diarrhea, investigators found that both solutions were capable of treating metabolic acidosis 12 hours after administration.25 Acetate has an advantage over bicarbonate because it does not alkalinize the abomasal fluid or interfere with the coagulation of milk.26 Sodium acetate also stimulates the absorption of water in the small intestine27 and is easily metabolized by peripheral tissues.26 The calves in this study continued to receive saccharose along with milk during the treatment phase. Studies in calves with spontaneous diarrhea2 and diarrhea induced by Escherichia coli\n27 showed that metabolic acidosis can cause a decrease in pCO2. One form of compensation during metabolic acidosis is an increase in ventilation and a consequent decrease in pCO2.\n13 However, this compensation was brief, and metabolic acidosis can persist for more than 24 hours before any sign of respiratory compensation. The lack of change in pCO2 after induction of diarrhea may be because of the fact that measurements during this period were taken at relatively large intervals and the animals could have shown signs of respiratory compensation during the time periods between measurements. The current recommended treatment for moderately dehydrated diarrheic calves is PO electrolyte administration alone, whereas combined administration of fluids IV and PO electrolyte administration is a fundamental requirement for treating severely dehydrated diarrheic calves.6 Traditional isotonic fluid administration is difficult and expensive to accomplish in the field, requiring venous catheterization, large volumes of isotonic fluid, and periodic monitoring.7, 10\n",
