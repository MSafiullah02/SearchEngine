In a crisis like none other, health care facilities and physicians are now facing shortages of ventilators, beds, and even basic personal protective equipment. Many physicians are already facing a profound ethical dilemma: how to allocate these resources during shortages 1, 2, 3, 4 ; with some hospitals, states and countries even having to establish policies on which groups of patients to prioritize in providing lifesaving treatment during the COVID-19 crisis. 5, 6, 7, 8 Bioethicists, thought leaders, and think tanks have formulated frameworks to provide guidance for physicians on how to allocate scarce resources during crises 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 . Already, as seen in guidelines of resource allocation published in the United States 14 during this COVID-19 pandemic, physicians are being asked to switch from doing what-is-best for the patient (patientcentric) to doing what-is-best for society (society-centric), a position that is both uncomfortable and unfamiliar for many American practitioners.",

You are standing next to a lever that can divert the train down a parallel track, one that has only one individual tied to the track. What should you do? Do you pull the lever to sacrifice the one person in order to save the five, or do you do nothing and allow the five to die?

In other words, the physician makes decision that is in the best interest of the patient. In contrast, during times of national crisis, it can be argued that the utilitarian or public-centric approach takes precedence 23 . Priorities are shifted from doing what is needed to save an individual patient to doing what is needed to achieve the greater public good. The utilitarian approach would require that a certain degree of rationing is needed to preserve the overall well-being of society. For example, suppose there are two patients who will require a truly emergency operation right now!; the first patient is a 30-year old woman who suffered a major liver laceration and will require massive blood transfusion, and a second patient is a 65-year old man who has peritonitis from a perforated diverticulitis. In normal times, the surgeon can fulfill his/her fiduciary responsibilities to both, because the community has sufficient capacity for him/her to do both operations simultaneously. In contrast, in a situation where the surgeon can perform only one surgery and resources such as blood products are scarce, under utilitarian ethics, the surgeon would choose to operate on the 65-year old man with peritonitis, because this would require fewer resources. To do otherwise would deplete the blood products, thus denying life-saving opportunities for more than one patient and preventing society from achieving the end goal of saving the most lives.",

In essence, this recommendation, which has been advocated by some bioethicists, is asking health care professionals to, metaphorically speaking, push the fat man over the bridge in order to save the five lives. From a Kantian perspective, removing the breathing tube from one patient and giving it to another in order to maximize the greater good of society violates the moral imperative of never treating other people as means to ends, even if the action leads to a greater good.

The double-effect principle allows for bad effects as long as the following conditions are met: (1) the action itself must be morally good or morally neutral, (2) the bad effect must not be the means by which the good effect is achieved, (3) the motive must be to achieve only the good effect, and (4) the good effect must be greater than the bad effect.

The greater number of lives saved, the motive to achieve the greater good for society (i.e. more lives saved), and death foreseen but unintended fulfilled the criteria. But, the bad effect (death) cannot be considered as morally good or morally neutral; and the patient posed no threat to society and therefore, the act of withdrawing ventilator support was neither morally good nor morally neutral. Furthermore, the death of the patient was used as a means to achieve the greater good for society. One might argue that the patient was not a means and if by chance, the patient somehow survives such an ordeal and that his/her survival did not affect the end goal of having more lives saved, then the double-effect principle has not been violated. Most patients, however, whose tubes are removed while still ventilator-dependent will die. Thus, in the case of reallocating ventilators during a COVID-19 shortage, the death of one patient is exchanged for the life of others; this is a principle that clearly violates the double-effect principle.",

Although current guidelines have made a laudable effort to be fair, equitable, and just, a lack of buy-in from the public may make it difficult to implement. Lack of public trust has its precedent. Prior experiences, such as the unconscionable Tuskegee experiment and the Willowbrook school study, have left vulnerable communities understandably distrustful of the medical system 28, 29 . Consequently, this distrust may have adverse impacts on how the public interprets any COVID-19 guidelines of ventilator reallocation that prioritizes a group or reallocates resources which have been instituted at hospitals across the country. While most of the guidelines were drawn with best intentions, even the most thoughtfully crafted ones run the risk of suffering from implicit bias. One study noted that \"respondents expressed greater resentment, gave lower health care priority scores, and were more reluctant to make a financial contribution to the health care costs of patients presented as black and unemployed than as white and unemployed\" 30 .",

            "text": "described a model for public values regarding how scarce mechanical ventilators should be allocated, one that is strikingly similar to the problem many hospitals are facing today during the COVID-19 pandemic31 . The study panel emphasized a dichotomy between the understanding of the lay public and reality of decisions that must be made in the health care setting. Most strikingly, the public expressed a desire to simply create more ventilators, and that emergency allocation of resources by health care teams would simply exacerbate existing inequalities (such as insured versus uninsured). Part of the ethical duty of health care workers is to address and quell these concerns from the public. One approach to do so may be improved communicationpublic officials can be more responsive in communications surrounding how ventilators and other life-saving equipment is being allocated and in describing the realities of why simply creating more equipment may not be immediately possible. Discussing such information honestly and transparently can also help combat misinformation that has circulated during COVID-19, as it has during the past.",
