His body temperature reached the highest of 38.5 . The laboratory examinations showed a lower degree of lymphocyte percentage and increased levels of C-reactive Protein (CRP) and fibrinogen, also with prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. On admission, nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract were timely obtained and he was confirmed with COVID-19 when the RT-PCR tests of the specimens for presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (DAAN GEEN co. LTD of Sun Yat-sen University) were positive on illness day 13. After a period of symptomatic and antiviral treatments including ganciclovir (250 mg, iv drip qd) and ribavirin (500 mg, iv drip bid), he met the Chinese Guideline criteria for hospital discharge (absence of clinical symptoms, substantially improved acute exudative lesions on chest computed tomography (CT) images and two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results separated by at least one day [1] ) on illness day 20. After hospital discharge, the patient was asked to continue the quarantine protocol at home for at least two weeks. However, similar to what has been reported recently [2], this patient had two re-positive RT-PCR test results again on illness day 34 and illness day 38 (post-discharge re-testing was a policy of the Chinese Government [1] ). He was thus re-hospitalized. This time he was asymptomatic and his chest CT scans showed improvement of original lesion with a few ground-glass opacities (Figure 1 ). We ran viral antibody tests on illness day 40 and got positive results too (INNOVITA Biotechnology Company, Chengdu precision medicine industrial technology research institute co. LTD of west China). The positive results of both IgM/IgG from this patient helped us to confirm the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [3]. He has been given further therapies like Chinese herbal medicines to enhance his immunity until the RT-PCR result from nasopharyngeal swabs becomes consecutively negative twice at the time of discharge.",

By using the same sampling and detection methods with the same detection sensitivity and in the same individual, it turned positive days later. Another reason for this turning from double negatives into positive was that the virus might be able to re-grow to a detectable level [2]. Additionally, this might be due to the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and also be related to the coexisted diseases, clinical status, glucocorticoid use, sampling method, sample processing or even SARS-CoV-2 re-infection of this patient [6]. It is unknown whether the repeated PCR positivity should be considered as evidence for virus alive or not because a virus-culture was not performed. In another word, whether the patient is still contagious or not remains unclear because he has no chance to show the infectivity. In order to prevent further transmission, discharged patients must have a 14-day-quarantine and close follow-up at home or in a centralized rehabilitation institution of Wuhan city, according to Chinese Government Policies [1] . We strongly suggest that such a quarantine be applied worldwide to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19.",
