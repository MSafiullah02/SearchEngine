Aspergillus is an air-borne pathogen, bringing the lungs in the frontline for defense. Recently, severe viral pulmonary infections have shown to be associated with an increased risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Severe influenza in critically ill patients for example, is complicated by IPA in 7\u201323% of cases and associated with a case fatality rate of more than 50% [1]. Similar to influenza, the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may cause severe lower respiratory tract infections leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The proportion of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who develop severe disease with ARDS is considerably high [2]. Consequently, there is a large number of patients in need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. It is not yet known, if patients with severe COVID-19 are at similar risk for IPA development as patients with severe influenza.",

White blood cell count was within the normal limits and C-reactive protein (CRP) was slightly elevated (33 mg/dl; upper limit of norm 5 mg/dl). D-dimer was within the normal range. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral basal coarse reticular opacities (Fig. 2\na and b). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from oropharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, the patient refused to be hospitalized due to personal reasons and was discharged home with oral doxycycline 200 mg q.d. One week later, the patient returned to the emergency department because of clinical deterioration and hypoxemia (arterial pO2 46 mmHg while breathing ambient air). Chest CT-scan was performed and showed multiple bilateral ground-glass opacities with a crazy paving appearance (Fig. 2c). In addition, a reversed halo sign was described (Fig. 2d). White blood-cell count was slightly elevated (11.65 \u00d7 10\u02c69 per L), neutrophils were elevated (9.7 \u00d7 10\u02c69 per L), CRP level was 144 mg/dl, interleukin-6 was 396 pg/ml and ferritin 465 ng/ml. Creatinine levels increased from 1.85 mg/dl (first presentation) to 3.26 mg/dl. Lymphocytes were within the normal range. The patient was admitted to ICU with moderate ARDS (oxygenation index 154) and received meropenem 1 g b.i.d., azithromycin 500mg once q.d., and hydroxychloroquine 200mg b.i.d. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chest X-ray revealed a progression of the bilateral infiltrates on day 2 after ICU admission concordant with significant pulmonary deterioration (oxygenation index <100). On day 3 of ICU stay (day 14 after onset of symptoms) endotracheal aspiration was obtained. Culture grew Aspergillus fumigatus (voriconazole minimal inhibitory concentration 0.125 mg/L), without bacterial growth. Aspergillus lateral-flow device (LFD) [3], detecting an Aspergillus specific antigen secreted during active growth of Aspergillus and not during colonization, was performed from the endotracheal aspirate and revealed a positive result. Due to low sample volume, galactomannan could not be performed from this respiratory specimen. Serum fungal biomarkers (galactomannan and 1,3-\u00df-D-glucan) remained negative. Based on progression of pulmonary infiltrates, recovery of Aspergillus fumigatus in endotracheal aspirate, positive LFD in endotracheal aspirate and the clinical deterioration the patient was diagnosed with putative invasive pulmonary aspergillosis according to Blot et al. [4] and intravenous voriconazole (6 mg/kg b.i.d followed by 4 mg/kg b.i.d.) was initiated on day 4 of ICU stay. Despite treatment of ICU and addition of voriconazole, the patient deceases 3 days after initiation of antifungal treatment due to multiorgan failure. Autopsy was not performed.",

The patient presented in this report had a two-week history of symptoms before he was admitted to the ICU. On ICU admission, a CT scan revealed a reversed halo sign that is usually suspicious for the presence of mucormycosis [7] but may also be found in other mold infections, particularly IPA [8]. Chest CT scans are a valuable tool for COVID-19 diagnosis and management. Ground-glass opacities with or without consolidations are observed in the majority of COVID-19 cases [9,10] but a reversed halo may be observed in some patients [9]. Similar to patients with severe influenza a halo or reversed halo sign may be indicative for presence of a pulmonary mold infection [11] and should therefore trigger further diagnostic steps to confirm or rule out IPA.",

This seems to be of special interest as based on the data from a recently published trial, showing that GM in serum is indeed elevated in the majority of patients with severe influenza [14] on ICU and the fact that a significant amount of IPA cases on ICU are still diagnosed post-mortem only, serum GM screening may be an important tool for early recognition of IPA in critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

Thus, new diagnostic criteria for ICU patients were established to overcome these limitations [4]. This criteria base on clinical signs and symptoms compatible with IPA, abnormal chest imaging of the lungs and microbiological evidence of presence of Aspergillus. This criteria turned out to be superior to the EORCT/MSG criteria in the ICU setting [4]. Also the patient reported in this case report would not have been classified as IPA according to the EORTC/MSG criteria from 2008 due to a missing host factor. Recently, in the influenza and aspergillosis trial, GM in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was added to the ICU criteria as an additional mycological criterium to overcome the limitation of imperfect culture sensitivity for aspergillosis [15].",
