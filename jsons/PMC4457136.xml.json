Vasculotide treatment started at 72 hours post-infection is able to rescue a significant subset of infected mice (Supplemental Figures 2,3). Furthermore, virus-induced hypoxemia and lung edema were greatly ameliorated with the drug (Fig. 1c\u2013d). Echocardiography revealed that lung edema was not due to impairment of left ventricular systolic function by the virus, consistent with an increase in vascular leak from lung injury13; analogously, the reduction in lung edema by Vasculotide was not from an improvement in left ventricular systolic function (Fig. 1e). Of note, the drug was similarly effective against a lethal dose of PR8 (H1N1), a second strain of influenza virus that is highly virulent in mice17 (Fig. 1f). Next, we infected mice with the 2009 swine-origin pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Although the mortality rate in these mice was only 25%, all of the Vasculotide-treated mice survived (Supplemental Figure 4). Thus, Vasculotide appears to be effective against lung injury caused by multiple strains of influenza.",

We therefore treated influenza virus-infected mice with amantadine18 alone or in combination with Vasculotide. Treatment with amantadine modestly but significantly improved survival (from 0 to 14%, Fig. 2a). Adjuvant Vasculotide markedly increased survival even when started as long as 72 hours after infection (83% survival) (Fig. 2a and Supplemental Figure 5). This was in association with significant improvements in arterial hypoxemia (Fig. 2b), hypothermia and weight loss (Fig. 2c\u2013d). These findings are especially important because mortality from influenza virus persists despite antiviral therapy and because the efficacy of such therapy declines rapidly over time467.",

These mice express significantly less Tie2 on the lung endothelium20. Infection of CD1 wild-type mice with influenza virus (Hkx31;H3N2) resulted in significant lethality (only 22% survival) that was greatly improved by Vasculotide (78% survival), even if started 48 hours after infection (Fig. 3a). Conversely, infection of haploinsufficient Tie2+/\u2212 mice resulted in a similar degree of mortality (25% survival) that was not significantly changed by the drug (50% survival), although there was a trend towards an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, in contrast to wild-type mice, Vasculotide had no effect on influenza virus-induced hypoxemia or hypothermia in the haploinsufficient mice (Fig. 3c\u2013d). Thus, the benefit of Vasculotide is dependent on Tie2 expression.",

We first established that Vasculotide has no antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 4a). Second, Vasculotide did not affect chemotaxis of human and murine monocytes and neutrophils in vitro (Fig. 4b\u2013c and data not shown). To our surprise, despite significantly improved arterial oxygen saturation and body weight (Fig. 4d\u2013e), Vasculotide-treated mice exhibited no difference in the severity of lung injury determined by blinded quantification of lung histology at 5 days post-infection (Fig. 4g) (this timepoint was chosen as infected mice die soon afterwards). Concordantly, while infection induced a marked increase in alveolar neutrophil recruitment, this was unaffected by treatment with Vasculotide (Fig. 4f); alveolar and serum cytokine levels on day 5 post-infection were also unaffected (Supplemental Figure 6). Thus, the mechanism of benefit of Vasculotide appears downstream of innate immune responses and instead involves the lung endothelial barrier.",

While the drug had no effect on human lung endothelial proliferation (Supplemental Figure 8), it significantly attenuated lung endothelial apoptosis in vitro in response to influenza virus, as assessed by cleavage of caspase-3 (Supplemental Figure 7c); we observed a similar reduction in cleaved caspase-3 in lungs from infected mice who received Vasculotide (Supplemental Figure 7d). Although the apoptotic cells in the lungs of infected mice undoubtedly reflect contributions from epithelium and leukocytes, we observed colocalization of cleaved caspase-3 with the endothelial-specific marker VE-cadherin, consistent with our in vitro data. Finally, while influenza infection caused loss of Tie2 from the lungs of infected mice, this was significantly attenuated by treatment with Vasculotide. Vasculotide treatment also markedly increased levels of phospho-Akt in the lung, an event that is known to be downstream of Tie2 activation22 and that acts as an endothelial pro-survival signal (Supplemental Figure 9).",

First, these data strongly implicate failure of the lung endothelial barrier as the cause of death in murine models of severe influenza, as Vasculotide conferred a significant survival benefit against multiple strains of the virus in two strains of mice. The effect of the drug is Tie2-dependent, appears to be downstream of innate immune activation and does not require inhibition of viral replication. Second, the enhancement of lung endothelial barrier integrity did not impair leukocyte recruitment to the lung, supporting the notion that vascular leak and leukocyte transmigration may be regulated independently23. Accordingly, administration of Vasculotide at the time of infection (i.e. even before leukocyte infiltration could occur) was not harmful and still conferred great benefit (Fig. 1b). Lastly, administration of Vasculotide even 3-4 days after infection significantly improved survival, an observation with practical implications given that the moment of infection in patients is usually uncertain.",

The potential clinical use of recombinant angiopoietin 1, the endogenous ligand for Tie2, is limited by its tendency to bind to the extracellular matrix and to form undesirable aggregates27; furthermore, modified forms of the protein are reportedly difficult to synthesize and are unstable27. In contrast, Vasculotide was invented based on phage display experiments in which over 1 billion unique peptides were screened to identify those capable of binding with high affinity to Tie22829. Vasculotide bears no sequence homology to angiopoietin-1 and exhibits no activity against or binding to some 500 cellular receptors (unpublished data); its specificity for Tie2 is also strongly supported by our data using Tie2 haploinsufficient mice. Given the existing literature on Ang1 and other putative barrier-enhancing agents142630, the ability of delayed administration of Vasculotide to rescue mice dying of influenza (Supplemental Figure 2) is unexpected and novel. This finding, combined with its relatively low cost of production and its chemical stability, suggests that the drug might constitute a practical therapy.",

Further work will determine whether it affects other mediators of vascular instability including angiopoietin-232 and VE-PTP33. As its mechanism of action is independent of viral replication and instead involves modulation of the host response, it is possible that Vasculotide may not engender viral resistance, but this hypothesis will require direct testing. Since influenza virus infections are often complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia34, novel agents that impair the innate immune response may not be without risk. The fact that Vasculotide does not impede neutrophil recruitment to the lung is therefore reassuring. Finally, whether the impressive benefit of Vasculotide in the therapy of the influenza virus carries implications for other infectious agents35 or non-infectious causes of ARDS will require further investigation.",
