            "text": "The quest for resilient cities is becoming increasingly urgent amongst policy makers and the academia across the world. As complex entities, cities provide multiple entry points through which resilience can be explored and negotiated. These already complex pathways to resilience are further complicated by the issue of climate change in the developing world, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The reality is that, while cities in the developing world are experiencing some of the highest risks of global climate change, they are largely ill-equipped to adapt to the changing climatic conditions. This article aims to contribute to the subject of the quest for resilient cities by exploring the climate change resilience building discourse, and more specifically the social capital aspects pertinent to that discourse, in the peri-urban context of SSA. Explicitly, the article explores social capital with a focus on how it can potentially contribute to or inhibit socio-ecological system resilience (SESR) building processes in the context of climate change. It examines two major forms of social capital, i.e. bonding and bridging, and discusses their potential impact on climate change resilience discourse in the peri-urban developing world context. To realize this aim, the article engages in both conceptual and empirical exploration. While the theoretical exploration is drawn from social capital and resilience related literature, the empirical information comes from research in the peri-urban areas of Pugu and Kazimzumbwi forest reserves (PKFRs), on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam city in Tanzania. Moreover, the article builds upon and complements the growing number of studies on these peri-urban forest reserves which have established the continued decline of ecosystem services (Lupala et al. 2014; Lupala and Maglan 2015; Kashaigili et al. 2013, 2014). These studies have linked the reduction of ecosystem services to climate change effects as peri-urban dwellers resort to encroaching on the reserves as part of their autonomous adaptation strategy. This has led to a call to explore the potential for building sustainable SESR. Recent research work by Mngumi (2019) in \u2018these\u2019 peri-urban forest reserves has in part answered this call, suggesting that ecosystem services-based adaptive capacities offer enormous potential for building resilience against climate change effects. The work by Mngumi contributes to filling the knowledge void on the ecological dimension identified in earlier studies; it also highlights the need to explore the social aspects necessary for building resilience to climate change effects in these peri-urban areas. It is against this background that the present article contributes to furthering the scholarship in this topic, which is under-researched in general and especially in the context of peri-urban areas in SSA. Following this brief introduction, the article comprises four sections. The next section offers a theoretical review, while \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section describes the methodology of the study. The major empirical findings are presented and discussed in \u201cResults and discussion\u201d section, while \u201cConclusions\u201d section highlights the main conclusions of the study and makes some suggestions for further scholarship.",

            "text": "The understanding and application of the concept of social capital is still evolving. Bourdieu (1986, p. 248) offered the first definition of social capital, as \u2018the aggregate of the actual or potential resources linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition\u2019. He argued that social networks are not given but rather constructed through investment strategies oriented to the institutionalization of group relations, usable as a reliable source of benefits. The concept of social capital revolves around the idea that well-connected community members are better positioned to mobilize resources in pursuing their desired outcomes (Agnitsch et al. 2006). Social capital is thus built up by norms and networks that enable people to act collectively (Woolcock and Narayan 2006). Woolcock and Narayan argue further (idem.) that despite being articulated differently across disciplines, the idea that social networks oil the wheels of collective action is intuitively appealing in resilience-building discourse. Adger (2010) similarly argues that social capital has the potential to serve as an essential \u2018catalyst\u2019 for fueling economic development. In other words, the presence of social capital increases the capacity for action and the realization of wider community goals. This suggests that social capital has the potential to contribute towards achieving a myriad of development outcomes, especially at the community scale.",

            "text": "Although widely used in other development contexts, social capital has not been very prominent in climate change studies. However, seeing the impact that social capital has had on economic development and well-being (Ostrom 2000), there is a growing acknowledgement of its inherent potential in building SESR against the negative effects of climate change. The role of social capital is likely to be even greater when SESR building is explored in the developing world, given that the imperatives of social capital are even stronger in contexts of poverty\u2014for instance, social connectedness, help in times of need, and social safety nets\u2014especially when poverty is exacerbated by additional shocks and stresses such as climate change. Moreover, social capital is increasingly regarded as a platform upon which other forms of capital\u2014such as agency, innovative economy\u2014can be effectively developed in building resilience to climate change (Agnitsch et al. 2006). Yet, despite the increased understanding of the potential role of social capital on resilience building, its application in the urban climate change context is negligible, as most interventions still invest heavily in physical infrastructure (Adger 2010; Aldrich and Meyer 2015).",

            "text": "Two categories of social capital are particularly relevant for this article: bonding social capital and bridging social capital (Aldrich and Meyer 2015; Agnitsch et al. 2006; Putnam 2000). Putman provides an elaborate description of these categories of social capital. Bonding social capital looks more inwards and emphasizes identities and groups of a homogeneous nature (Putnam 2000). Putman explains that bonding social capital thrives in well-embedded groups with strong affective ties linking group members to one another, and is crucial in providing social support and in cementing in-group solidarity. This type of social capital is important in building socio-ecological system resilience in climate change affected communities in peri-urban areas of the developing world: this is because social support and in-group solidarity are crucial in preparing the ground for other adaptive capacity attributes necessary to build socio-ecological resilience to climate change effects.",

            "text": "However, the co-existence of urban and rural features in peri-urban areas of the developing world makes deployment of bridging social capital even more imperative in building SESR. Bridging social capital links people or groups of different orientations; in addition, it addresses how social capital facilitates resource acquisition (Putnam 2000), which is central to resilience pathways. Unlike bonding social capital, whose networks are comprised of similar individuals with supposedly equivalent resources, bridging social capital can address the array of differences typical of peri-urban areas. It also plays a crucial role in facilitating information flow within and between groups and improving access to a wide range of resources (Ibid.). Bridging social capital enables the best use of relevant knowledge and technical know-how in terms of what is feasible and what options have most potential in a given context. The role of this category of social capital in building SESR against climate change effects in peri-urban areas of the global south is related to the realities of poverty linked to resource scarcity. This reality renders sections of the population at odds with each other when subjected to shocks and stresses such as climate change. If left on their own without the external synergies made possible by bridging social capital, communities would devise their own autonomous adaptation modalities which would most likely undermine long-standing efforts geared at addressing climate change effects. This scenario has indeed manifested itself in the peri-urban areas of PK-SES. After being subjected to climate change which reduced their livelihood options, a substantial proportion of community members resorted to encroaching on adjacent ecosystem services to earn their living, with no regard for the impact of their actions on those ecosystem services and on the climate. This undermined earlier initiative towards addressing climate change by, for example, degrading forest ecosystems, thereby reducing the carbon sequestration function of those forests. The \u2018resource gap\u2019 that is thus created can be at least partly addressed by bridging social capital. How the synergies of bridging social capital were manifested in the peri-urban areas of PK-SES will be articulated in the results and discussion section below.",

Scholars have pointed out some of the negative effects of close-knit, trusting groups, which include the exclusion of outsiders, excess claims on group members, restrictions on individual freedoms, and downward leveling norms. At the same time it is increasingly agreed that street gangs, mafia groups, drug rings, and racial supremacy groups are all likely to feature high levels of bonding social capital, yet their actions often lead to undesirable and harmful outcomes (Agnitsch et al. 2006). If this unfolds, it would likely jeorpadise the efforts towards building SESR in peri-urban areas.",

            "text": "The Pugu and Kazimzumbwi forest reserves (PKFRs), which lie within the peri-urban belt to the southwest of Dar es Salaam city in Tanzania (Fig. 1), form the setting for the case study. Administratively, the PKFRs are largely under the jurisdiction of the Kisarawe District Council (KDC) in the Coast Region of Tanzania, although a limited portion of Kazimzumbwi forest reserve falls within the administrative boundaries of the Ilala District in Dar es Salaam Region. The PKFRs are surviving remnants of some of the world\u2019s ancient forests; they are of global importance as they support 37 endemic vertebrate species and about 554 endemic plant species (Burgess 2000). Accordingly, they offer important insights for this study as the ecosystem services they provide contribute to our understanding of SESR building for climate change effects in peri-urban areas. The PKFRs also form the catchment area for a number of rivers: Msimbazi, Mambizi, Mzumbwi, Vikongoro, Kimani, Nzasa and Nyeburu (Lupala et al. 2014; TFCG 2013). The Pugu forest, which was gazetted as a reserve in 1954, lies in the northeastern part of the Pugu Hills, about 25 km from the Indian Ocean. The Kazimzumbwi forest reserve, which was gazetted in 1936 (Clarke and Dickinson 1995), lies to the southwest of Pugu. Both forests are influenced by the Indian Ocean tropical monsoon climate: they are characterized by a bimodal rainfall pattern which brings long rains between late March and early June, popularly known as Masika, and short rains between October and December, known as Vuli. The average annual rainfall is approximately 1,100 mm, and the temperature ranges from 24\u00b0 to 31\u00b0 depending on elevation (Clarke and Dickinson 1995; Lupala and Maglan 2015). Topographically, Pugu forest is positioned between 100 and 305 m above sea level, while Kazimzumbwi forest lies between 120 and 280 m above sea level (TFCG 2013).",

The two methods were deployed sequentially; key informant interviews were undertaken first, followed by household surveys. This sequence was important as key informant interviews laid the ground for the deeper understanding of the broader social capital milieu, with the specific focus on SESR for climate change effects. Moreover, the key informant interviews yielded information that enabled fine tuning of the household questionnaire which was later deployed for the purpose of mapping social capital in the PK-SES. Whilst I was personally involved in carrying out interviews with key informants, the household survey was executed by three research assistants. These three enumerators were university graduates, which was necessary to ensure that they could easily understand and follow the data collection protocol and adhere to the prescribed ethical standards. Another driver that prompted the use of graduates in collecting data was the fact that the household questionnaire was framed in English (see \u201cAppendix\u201d), so it was essential to use enumerators who were fluent in English and Swahili. Prior the execution of the survey, I convened a two-day training session to familiarize the enumerators with the survey questions, and the entire survey protocol. Since the educational level of the majority of respondents was primary or lower (see Table 1), and some could not read or write well, the enumerators were responsible not only for asking the questions but also for filling in the responses on the questionnaires. The household survey took place over two consecutive weeks, with one enumerator responsible for each of the three hamlets. Every evening, I convened a brief session with all the enumerators to cross check the filling of the questionnaires and to receive feedback on the progress of the survey. This forum was used for discussing and deliberating upon any emerging anomalies from the survey work. This was crucial for ensuring data quality and consistency of the collection process, which is an integral part of the internal validity check for data quality in a case study inquiry. Once submitted, the completed questionnaires were kept in the case study database pending further scrutiny and analysis.",

The score of this scale was obtained by first taking the six sub-item scores and then dividing the subtotal by six (the number of sub-items). After the item scores were derived, bonding social capital was obtained by adding together the first five scales (one to five) and dividing by five (the number of items). Bridging social capital was calculated by adding together the last five scales (six to ten) and dividing by five (the number of items).

This indicates the existence of a high level of internal cohesion that can be used in the course of building SESR for climate change effects. The role of bonding social capital in building SESR lies in its potential influence on economic development which is a vital component in the resilience building discourse. In particular, bonding social capital is regarded as an essential element for collective action which is a key ingredient for SESR building processes. The importance of social capital in supporting economic development which can promote SESR building processes in the face of climate change effects in peri-urban areas in SSA is twofold. The first aspect relates to the widespread income poverty experienced in SSA, which highlights the crucial role played by bonding social capital: close social ties and help in times of need are of paramount importance in navigating pathways for building SESR in general, but also with specific reference to peri-urban areas which are subject to stress, including climate change stress. Building SESR is a key way of addressing and alleviating this stress, and social capital lies at the core. As previously noted, this holds true for SSA and for other countries with similar social and economic structures in the global south which face widespread poverty linked to community dependence on (unsustainable) extraction from provisioning ecosystem services (Mngumi 2019). This extractive dependency\u2014or socio-ecological interdependence\u2014highlights the reality of poverty in these communities. It also demonstrates the importance of deploying bonding social capital as an important tool in building SESR against climate change effects. This is very clear in the study area which is characterized by poverty and experiencing the negative impact of climate change on ecosystem services. Bonding social capital is thus increasingly regarded as an essential stimulus for fueling economic development, thereby forming a key attribute in building SESR against climate change effects in peri-urban areas.",

The following sub-section will detail the attributes of bridging social capital in building SESR at the PK-SES, but at this juncture it is important to note the role of bonding social capital as an anchor for other adaptive capacities, since all activities have to be channeled through the existing social capital structures. In this case, existing social ties and networks serve as primary nodes for accessing and disseminating the newer resources such as technology or information essential for building SESR against climate change effects. The effectiveness of the supportive role of bonding social capital in creating a conducive environment for peri-urban SESR building is dependent on the degree of bonding social capital itself. In general, the higher the level of bonding social capital, the greater the potential for other factors to contribute effectively towards building SESR. However, whilst strong social ties are considered to be of considerable importance in building SESR against climate change effects, there are limits: when bonding social capital becomes extremely strong (a Cronbach\u2019s alpha score of close to 1), it is likely to result in groups that are so powerful as to be damaging (Agnitsch et al. 2006). When this happens, the strength of social ties and networks might actually jeopardize SESR building pathways. This would necessitate exploring modalities for offsetting the bonding effect towards building SESR. As Table 3 shows, the bonding social capital score for the peri-urban areas of PK-SES is strong but not extreme; there is therefore no likelihood of jeopardizing the process of building SESR. Moreover, the damaging effect of strong bonding capital is context and case specific. In some scenario it has actually turned out to be of an anticipated help in crisis. This has been recently evidenced in South Africa where the cronic harmful gangs have been reported to support distribution of food and other humanitarian services to the poor households following the recent Covid-19 pandemic lockdown strategy.",

As explained above, this is a strong score, indicating the existence of substantial bridging social capital in the peri-urban areas of PK-SES. Given the potential of bridging social capital in building SESR against climate change affected peri-urban SES in SSA, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha scale score in the study area is promising. Like many other peri-urban areas in SSA, the PK-SES sites are experiencing declining ecosystem services, with negative implications for livelihood options and for climate change adaptation and mitigation potential. Indeed, ecosystem services decline in the PK-SES is likely to have been partly triggered by climate change effects, forcing peri-urban dwellers to increasingly exploit local ecosystem services as a way of adapting to the growing effects of climate change. Although such autonomous adaptation may not be bad in itself, when viewed through the lens of climate change, it can become critical. This raises the question of soliciting and engaging input which is external to the SES in question in order to support local potential in building SESR against climate change effects to arrive at a \u2018win\u2013win\u2019 outcome. The sum of resources external to the SES which synergistically engage with existing potential within the SES towards building SESR, is expressed as bridging (or linking) social capital. As already noted, analysis of the household survey suggests that the PK-SES has considerable bridging social capital resources, or resilience-building factors (adaptive capacities). As Table 3 shows, bridging social capital is particularly strong, relative to bonding social capital. While, as afore-hinted, very high levels of bonding social capital can be undesirable, this is not the case for bridging social capital; here, the higher the score the better in terms of building synergies, integrating resources from inside and from outside the SES.",

These integrative networks embodied \u2018alien\u2019 thinking (from outside the PK-SES) which was, however, crafted within local structures and which deployed local resources towards the common goal of building SESR. The formation of such networks was repeatedly noted during key informant interviews. One such network comprises the village environmental committees (VECs). In an interview with one TFS official, the formation of VECs was described as follows:Through the influence of WCST, VECs were formed in villages adjacent to the PK-SES. These committees have been instrumental in establishing tree nurseries which have increased income to community members and thereby reduced the dependence on forest reserve for survival. The committees have also provided valuable contribution in reducing the level of encroachment to these peri-urban forest reserves.From key informant interviews it could be deduced that the formation of VECs in hamlets surrounding the PK-SES was having a positive effect. Thanks to WCST, a number of such committees were formed in hamlets including Kisarawe, Maguruwe, Vibula, Chanika, Nzasa, Nyeburu and Vigama. VECs were partly responsible for raising community awareness regarding the importance of conserving PKFRs, highlighting the benefits accruing to the community as well as those accruing to the environment, specifically in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Through VECs, tree nurseries were established which played two important roles: firstly, they served as a source of income to the members of the VECs; secondly, they provided a continuous source of tree seedlings. This in turn gave an impetus to tree planting campaigns undertaken by WCST and KDC which aimed to promote tree planting within the boundaries of the PKFRs and beyond. Tree planting in areas adjacent to the PKFRs promoted village forest reserves which in turn serve as a buffer zone for the main forest reserves. This has not only reduced dependency on provisioning services in the PKRFs but has also broadened community livelihood options. Thus, the formation of the VECs had a tangible impact on the peri-urban dwellers and also contributed towards building SESR against climate change effects.",

This provides community members with survival strategies which reduce the level of forest encroachment and its negative consequences vis-\u00e0-vis climate change (Scott and Becken 2010). This was partly achieved through the concerted efforts between bridging social capital \u2018players\u2019 and resources inherent within the PK-SES. Activities geared towards promoting climate friendly income generation included bee keeping, introduced and championed by a number of the governmental and NGO groups (TFS, KDC, WCST, Green Voices) and community-based groups (PPS, Mwangaza, Vigama, Maguruwe, Nchage and Chanzige). Bee keeping was thus introduced through bridging social capital external to the PK-SES (WCST and Green Voices); newly established bee keeping groups were supplied with the initial capital necessary for start-up, which was particularly vital as most members of the groups could not raise enough funds for intalling the project due to income poverty. This initial financial help was followed by capacity building, assisting the groups with establishing bee hives, hive management, bee products and their respective potential markets. This example supports the theoretical preposition elucidated in \u201cSocial capital perspectives in climate change resilience-building discourse\u201d section, that social capital is an important factor in building SESR in peri-urban areas of the developing world and SSA in particular. While the argument in \u201cSocial capital perspectives in climate change resilience-building discourse\u201d section relates to bonding social capital, via its collective action potential, the fieldwork shows that bridging social capital was also vital in the PK-SES, suggesting that this type of social capital can play a synergistic role in building SESR in peri-urban in SSA. In this context, bee keeping, as a climate friendly economic activity (provisioning ecosystem service), enabled peri-urban dwellers to increase their income, which in turn reduced the potentially damaging community dependence on other, at-risk ecosystem services. Given the potential benefits of bee keeping, the responsible authorities felt justified in allowing such activities to take place within the forest reserves.",

            "text": "Another important climate friendly income earning activity derived from bridging social capital is the planting of early maturing hybrid mango tree species (EMHMTS). This initiative was also driven by WCST, which distributed EMHMTS to peri-urban dwellers at the PK-SES for commercial purposes. Whilst the introduction of EMHMTS was primarily aimed at increasing income earning options, it also contributed in a number of ways towards building SESR against climate change effects. Bridging social capital once again played an important role by providing technical know-how regarding the production and marketing of mangoes. One particularly important piece of knowledge that was acquired by peri-urban dwellers in the PK-SES is how to graft traditional mango species with the newer EMHMTS. Inherent within the knowledge transfer component of bridging social capital, this also has sustainability implications, as the acquired knowledge (technical know-how) can potentially have long-lasting benefits for the recipient SES\u2014as was indeed the case in the PK-SES, several years after the program had been introduced. Like the bee keeping initiative, the EMHMTS strategy was also claimed to have contributed to reducing dependence on traditional provisioning ecosystem services in the PK-SES, thereby contributing to increased carbon storage and higher levels of carbon sequestration. At the same time, bridging social capital also played a role in promoting cultural ecosystem services (CES). Again, this was realized though synergies, integrating potential resources from within the PK-SES and external resources in the form of bridging social capital. This involved a number of the actors mentioned in Table 2: TFS and KDC on the side of the government and Afri Roots, Jane Goodall, Fly Company, PHCTE, KCTE, Safari 56, and MHCTE on the side of NGOs/private companies. In this realm of CES, the role of bridging social capital was manifested in several ways, first and foremost through the formation of some of the entities established for spearheading CES towards building SESR. In interview, an official of KDC shared the following:The PK-SES has enormous CES potential for boosting the economy of peri-urban dwellers. This would in turn help to protect and safeguard the forest reserves thereby building resilience against climate change effects. Yet, in the past, there has been [very little] substantial effort deployed in tapping this opportunity for fruitful community and environmental impact. However, currently the KDC are giving particular attention to this area. In so doing, we have promoted and facilitated the formation of local cultural tourism based enterprises. These include: PHCTE, KCTE and the MHCTE. Whilst these local based cultural tourism enterprises are still in their infancy, they show signs of positive futures towards building a climate friendly local economy.Another example of this role for bridging social capital is provided by Afri Roots. Whilst the PK-SES has numerous cultural tourism sites with potential for boosting climate friendly livelihoods among the peri-urban dwellers, these are largely underdeveloped (Mngumi 2019). It could be argued that the PK-SES had a resource deficit when it came to activating its huge, untapped cultural tourism potential, including a lack of technical know-how. However, through the bridging social capital provided by Afri Roots, infrastructure is now being improved with the aim of tapping the area\u2019s cultural tourism potential. An Afri Roots representative stated in an interview that, despite having high cultural tourism potential, the PK-SES lacked the physical infrastructures that would encourage tourists to visit. Afri Roots had therefore supported the process of developing walkways to the tourist sites in the PK-SES, and had played a vital role in advertising the area\u2019s cultural tourist attractions. Tourist numbers at the cultural tourism sites in the PK-SES have begun to climb. In addition, Afri Roots devised a 20 km weekend cycling tour from Dar es Salaam city to the cultural attraction sites of the PK-SES. This has further opened up the cultural tourism potential to local and international tourists. These interventions by a bridging social capital player (in this case Afri Roots) have also created climate friendly employment opportunities for peri-urban dwellers, thereby contributing to building SESR against climate change effects. Moreover, other interventions by Afri Roots in the PK-SES include promoting tourism related activities such as hiking, bird watching, mountain biking, and antiquities, as well as promoting Swahili culture and Swahili foods. Other bridging social capital players engaged in promoting cultural tourism include TFS, KDC, Safari 56, PHCTE, MHCTE and KCTE.",

            "text": "Another role played by bridging social capital in building resilience at the PK-SES was through promoting participatory forest management (PFM). This has been effected through integrated efforts between a number of social capital players, including WCST, TFS, KDC, TFCG, UMITASU, MJUMITA and Green Voices. There have been several initiatives geared at PFM: interventions in this area include promoting friendly relations between the communities in the forest reserve neighborhoods; encouraging climate friendly livelihood activities in the forest reserve and its neighborhoods, such as collecting forest products; and allowing community members to practice their traditional rituals and taboos within the forest reserves. PFM is argued to inculcate a spirit of environmental stewardship which in turn creates a sense of ownership and belonging and eventually reduces the level of forest encroachment, thereby boosting the forest\u2019s carbon sequestration function. These claims are echoed by (Agrawal and Angelsen 2009). PFM, like other bridging social capital strategies mentioned, has contributed to building SESR against climate change effects though opening up climate friendly livelihood options.",

            "text": "However, in the course of building resilience to climate change effects at the PK-SES, one limitation facing the bridging social capital players (i.e. actors external to the PK-SES) was very clear. This is the problem of limited government support. The bridging social capital players have contributed substantially to the building of SESR in tandem with local players and resources. However, to make most effective use of this synergy with local communities in building SESR against climate change effects, the unstinting support of the government is of paramount importance. In this regard, the local government authority (KDC) and the central government agency responsible for safeguarding ecosystem services (TFS), had variously contributed towards building SESR as argued beforehand. However, during key informant interviews it was reported that government support is not as anticipated. The unqualified support from the government players was repeatedly emphasized during key informant interviews, as in the example below:There is a tendency of ill-support from the government related players namely TFS and KDC. Despite we private players being willing to support and promote tourism industry in these peri-urban forest reserves, we have been receiving inadequate support from the government counterparts which is discouraging. There are a number of initiatives (for instance creating walk ways along the forest reserves) which we have volunteered to support the industry but surprisingly the government machinery instead of backing up our efforts turns out to be the stumbling block.When a government representative responded to an inquiry regarding the inadequate support to bridging social capital players, a number of setbacks were mentioned. These included lack of manpower, unclear power relations, and budgetary limitations. Although not the central focus of this article, worries about sustainability also arose during key informant interviews. For example, several initiatives had been established aimed at building SESR for climate change effects as part of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD++) pilot project,3 but some of these are no longer functioning. It was noted that WCST, in particular, had made a substantial contribution in promoting and facilitating initiatives aimed at building resilience to climate change effects during the REDD++ project but at the end of the project, there was no effective sustainability plan. TFS was supposed to take over some of the initiatives started by WCST but to date it has not been able to fill that gap appropriately.",

            "text": "The theoretical and empirical analysis presented in this paper on the potential contribution of social capital towards building SESR against climate change effects in peri-urban areas leads to two main conclusions. The first conclusion concerns the importance of social capital in building SESR in peri-urban areas of the developing world. The analysis has shown that both bonding and bridging social capital are essential ingredients in building peri-urban resilience. This argument aligns with current thinking that sees resilience primarily as a social phenomenon. Indeed, the social nature notio of resilience is even more relevant in urban and peri-urban areas in SSA, where engineering approaches has been largely dominant. This leads to the second conclusion from this research: that social capital needs to be clearly conceptualized and then factored into climate change resilience building pathways in peri-urban areas in SSA. This would in turn contribute to building resilient cities in the region, as peri-urban spaces constitute an integral yet largely neglected part of cities in SSA.",
