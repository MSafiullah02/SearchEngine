Majority of rabies cases reported from developed countries involve wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. However, it is a major health concern in developing countries which account for more than 99% of all human deaths from rabies [2]. Exposure to rabid dogs is the cause of bulk (>99%) of human rabies deaths world-wide [3]. India has a particularly severe problem, with as many as 30,000 human deaths and 2 million people requiring post-exposure vaccination yearly. Stray and community dogs cause vast majority of human cases. Though potent and safe cell-culture derived inactivated vaccines are available, their efficacy may be compromised by disruption of cold chain storage, poor general health status of the subject, poor vaccination techniques.",

Besides their immunogenicity, DNA vaccines offer several other practical advantages. DNA vaccines being free from foreign proteins may not cause the various side reactions, which may be observed for conventional vaccines. In addition to the safety, they may have benefits of being inexpensive, overcome the need of time consuming procedures that are needed for purification of subunit proteins, are stable, can be stored and transported at room temperature.",

Efficient delivery of antigens to both MHC Class I and Class II processing and presentation pathways is required for generating an ideal immune response comprising of both CD8+ and CD4+ (cell-mediated) and antibody (humoral) immune response. Accordingly, this study investigates strategies for targeting glycoprotein antigen to MHC Class I and Class II pathways for improving its antigenicity, immunogenicity and protective efficacy.",

            "text": "For targeting MHC Class II pathway, we utilized Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA) and human Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein-1 (LAMP-1) signal sequences. TPA-fused antigens are highly expressed secreted proteins with elevated uptake by antigen-presenting cells; and thus, bring about a more generalized activation of the immune system. They have been shown to induce significant humoral and cell-mediated responses [23]. LAMP-1 is a type of transmembrane protein localized predominantly to lysosomes and late endosomes. Antigen trafficking of LAMP-1-fused antigens to the cellular site of MHC Class II processing and presentation pathway could enhance its presentation to MHC Class II restricted CD4+ T cells [24] and thus augment the humoral response. On the other hand, for directing the antigen to MHC Class I, signal sequence of Ubiquitin A-76 (UQ) was employed. UQ-conjugated antigens are trafficked through the proteasome, an organelle that generates short peptides for presentation via the MHC Class I pathway [25]. Such UQ-conjugated antigens are expected to enhance the cellular immune response. UQ-conjugated proteins have been shown to generally undergo rapid intracellular degradation and can elicit cytokine responses in the absence of specific antibody production [26]. Thereby, we explored the potential of targeted DNA vaccine encoding the glycoprotein antigen fused to TPA, LAMP-1 or UQ to elicit superior immune response in comparison to the unmodified (without target sequence) DNA vaccine.",

Transient transfection of BHK-21 cells with all the plasmid DNA constructs revealed expression of rabies glycoprotein by flow cytometric analysis. Majority of the cells were found to express glycoprotein as seen by the fluorescence monitored by cell sorter. Thus, DNA vaccine constructs were capable of efficiently expressing the glycoprotein. Distribution of chimeras was analyzed by subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting. Total cell lysate of transfected BHK-21 cells of all the constructs expressed glycoprotein at approximately 67 kDa. The observed high molecular weight of RV-G expressed in BHK-21 cells could be due to the influence of host factors on glycosylation [45]. Morimoto et al. showed both BHK and Murine Neuroblastoma (MNA) cell lines, transformed with the same retroviral expression vector encoding RV-G cDNA, show different patterns of glycosylation of the expressed RV-G [45]. rRV-G expressed by BHK cells was highly glycosylated and sialylated in comparison to MNA expressed rRV-G, indicating that the glycosylation and sialylation of RV G is dependent on the cellular conditions in which RV-G is produced. Analysis of subcellular fractions indicated that glycoprotein along with the targeting sequences was suitably recognized by mammalian cells and directed towards the respective pathway. From flow cytometric and immunoblotting analysis of transfected cells, it can be inferred that there was efficient recognition and expression of DNA vaccine immunogens in the mammalian system. The signal sequences successfully directed the glycoprotein to respective cellular locations, with comparable levels of expression as of total cell lysate.",

This was assessed by cytokine profiling of splenocytes immunized with signal sequence tagged glycoprotein based vaccine or only vector; upon in vitro stimulation with inactivated PV-11 virus. We found that all the cytokines analyzed could be detected from the splenocytes of DNA vaccine immunized mice, with a pronounced enhancement in the level of IL-2 and IL-12 in the pgp.LAMP-1 immunized group. For other cytokines, namely IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3, similar levels of cytokines were observed for all the four groups, with the level being several folds in comparison to the splenocytes from control group. Antigen binding to the T cell receptor (TCR) stimulates the secretion of IL-2, and the expression of IL-2 receptors IL-2R. The IL-2/IL-2R interaction then stimulates the growth, differentiation and survival of antigen-selected cytotoxic T cells via the activation of the expression of specific genes. IL-2 facilitates production of immunoglobulins made by B cells and induces the differentiation and proliferation of natural killer cells. IL-12, produced mainly by macrophages and dendritic cells, is quickly induced by viral infections or by vaccination stimuli. IL-12 strengthens the non-specific immune responses by activating NK cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 and in synergy with IFN-\u03b3, drives the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells, more adapted to the control of viral infections.",

High titers of RVNA and protection conferred in DNA vaccines might be due to the possibility that modified immunogens led to the expression of RV-G with appropriate folding and better accessibility of epitopes to immune system, critical for generating RVNA titers. In spite of similar magnitude of immune response generated, protective efficacies against viral challenge varied. The unmodified and secreted forms of vaccines were found to be inferior in inducing protection against viral challenge. Xiang et al. also reported that secreted form of vaccine did not confer significant protective immunity [46]. Protection against rabies virus is mainly mediated by neutralizing antibodies [47]; subtle differences in the conformation of the secreted protein, not readily detectable by conventional biochemical methods, might select a different repertoire of neutralizing antibodies with lower avidity to the full length G protein present on the surface of viral particles, thus being less able to prevent the spread of virus [48].",

A probable explanation for this could be that the tagged antigens evoke similar levels of immunity and act to enhance survival via the same primary protective mechanism. We observed that ubiquitination of antigen for MHC Class I targeting also enhanced the IgG1 antibody and CD4+ mediated cytokine response. Thus, we infer that the peptides generated by proteasomal degradation could also be presented by MHC-II. While, there is no specific information of how protein processing in transfected cells occurs in vivo, different mechanisms have been postulated. They include direct priming by somatic cells, direct priming by antigen-presenting cells, or cross priming of antigen-presenting cells. Activation by cross priming appears to be the most probable immune mechanism which occurs following intramuscular vaccination that could be shared by the TPA, LAMP-1 and UQ vaccines [24], [49], [50], [51], [52]. Cross priming may occur via exit of exogenous antigens from the endocytic compartments and its processing in the cytosol, recycling of MHC-I molecules through endosomal/lysosomal pathway and transfer of processed peptides to the endosomal compartments. It is well known that CD4+ T-cell stimulation can result from endocytosis of exogenous peptides or proteins followed by antigenic processing via MHC Class II pathways [53]. LAMP-1 targeting of antigen has been reported to increase the number of immunogenic peptide epitopes that activate CD4+ T cells, thus inducing a broadened immune response in comparison to untargeted antigen [54]. Recent studies have also demonstrated that exogenous proteins or peptides, possibly complexed to heat shock proteins, can be taken up by antigen processing cells, processed through the MHC Class I pathway, and ultimately stimulate na\u00efve CD8 cells [55], [56]. Thus, via cross-priming mechanisms, secreted fusion proteins expressed from TPA plasmids, membrane bound fused proteins expressed from LAMP-1 or peptides released from cells transfected with the UQ constructs could induce both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations.",

Actin was used as positive control. (b) The address tags efficiently target glycoprotein to various sub cellular locations. Cell lysates, lysosomal fractions, concentrated culture supernatant and membrane fractions were prepared 40 h post-transfection. Subsequently, the protein samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Presence of rabies glycoprotein was detected using mouse polyclonal anti-rabies hyperimmune sera followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The blot was developed using BCIP/NBT as substrate.",
