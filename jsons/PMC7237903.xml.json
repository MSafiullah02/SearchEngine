Live virus has been isolated from faecal samples with a positive PCR result, however it is not consistently cultured and only small studies have been conducted (5,15). ACE2 receptor is abundantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract which may account for the presence of virus in the stool however it is also expressed in the kidney and there is minimal evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in urine to date (5,6,14,15,18,19). Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum has been demonstrated in some studies however the proportion of positive samples is generally low (5,6,15,20).",

The early peak suggests transmission is likely to occur early in the disease course when the patient may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. A pre-print study supports this hypothesis with the finding of a higher rate of infection in people exposed to index patients within 5 days of symptom onset than those exposed after this time (36). In addition, a recently published study by He et al. (35) used clinical and epidemiological data to estimate that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be infectious from 2.3 days prior to symptom onset, with a peak at 0.7 days prior. Together these findings suggest that containment methods successful in prevention of SARS transmission (i.e. isolating newly diagnosed cases) are unlikely to be effective in preventing spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Up to half of patients with SARS-CoV-2 have been found to develop an antibody response by Day 7 after symptom onset, with the vast majority seroconverting by Day 15 (5,37). Serological testing may also identify patients with past infection without PCR positivity and has been used in surveillance to identify previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide the infectious link between known cases (38). Serological testing may provide greater utility in estimating the prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection within the community and its use is becoming more widespread worldwide as the pandemic progresses. While there is not definitive evidence for long-term immunity with seroconversion, positive serological testing has been proposed as a possible strategy to identify those with immunity, which would be especially useful in healthcare workers.",

As identified above, there are currently considerable gaps in our knowledge regarding viral shedding over time and across contexts, and the concrete risks to patients themselves, healthcare workers and the community at large. Diagnostics, in this case, has the considerable potential for providing data but also, and somewhat paradoxically, raising levels of uncertainty (i.e. positive results versus clarity around actual significance). Practices of testing, and their interpretations, thus have considerable implications for healthcare services burden, potential over-treatment (or under-treatment), as well as producing further uncertainty in the community of the \u2018silent threat\u2019 posed by those who have come into contact with SARS-CoV-2. Among many other implications, the identification of viral RNA on PCR without sufficient evidence of risk, or significance, offers the potential for inducing further social stigma within and beyond the clinical environment. Whilst sensitivity of testing is a vital aspect of the challenge of SARS-CoV-2, so too is moderating the need for testing, versus utilising best-evidence of likely risks/costs. What remains critical is incorporating best evidence of viral shedding and infective risk into routine care practices, which seek to reduce excess intervention and fear amongst healthcare workers and the community. This must include educational communication, based on nuanced understandings of viral shedding, which would usefully allay community/political fears around transmissibility, as well as reduce burden on healthcare services. In sum, further detailed exploration of viral shedding and its clinical/social significance would serve a range of purposes including: reducing potentially unnecessary isolation practices and length of care; increasing containment/intervention in cases of genuine risk where shedding was previously under-recognised; reduce in social stigma around those who are no longer ill but perceived as a potential threat; and, reduce in clinical and community uncertainty and fear around the ambiguities of the \u2018tail end\u2019 of SARS-CoV-2.",
