Informal names for undescribed species match those used by Maddison and Hedin (2003). The specimens are not the same, and the localities are not necessarily the same, as those used for molecular phylogenetic work by Maddison and Hedin (2003). Because geographic variability in some species hints to the possibility that some populations may represent distinct species, morphologically or karyotypically distinctive populations were kept separate for the analyses. This required a linking of the chromosome\u2010sampled populations onto the molecularly sampled populations so that the chromosomes could be interpreted on the molecular phylogeny. Chromosome data were linked to the geographically nearest and morphologically most similar population in the molecular phylogeny, indicated in Table S1 by the \u201cLink\u201d column. Chromosome data of the outgroup Pellenes peninsularis were linked to the molecular voucher from the very closely related (if not conspecific) Pellenes cf. apacheus.",

Therefore, except where the chiasma is fully distal, there is a point, along the length from the centromere to the tips, at which the chromosome bends. This is taken as the point of the chiasma. The lengths of the chromosome segments between centromere and bend, and between bend and tip, were measured. Chiasma position was calculated as (length centromere to bend)/(total length). Measurements were taken either along the interior or along the exterior of the chromosome arms, depending on the picture's clarity. The ratios of the measurements for each of the four chromatids were averaged to determine the chiasma position for the whole chromosome bivalent. If no bend could be identified because the chiasma position was extreme, the position was determined to be proximal (0.0) or distal (1.0), depending on the bivalent's orientation relative to the spindle. For a species to be included in the analysis, we required at least 40 scored chromosomes.",

Second, preliminary runs with GARLI (likelihood; Zwickl 2006) and MrBayes (Bayesian; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003) resulted in trees with some very short branches, including in parts of the tree variable in sex chromosomes.

As this test requires two binary variables, chiasma localization was discretized by coding as 1 ( = distally localized) those taxa with median chiasma position 0.8 or over, those below as 0. This threshold matches a gap in the distribution of chiasma localization among species (Fig. S1). The test was applied using MacClade 4.08 (Maddison and Maddison 2005) with the BEAST tree, and with discretized chiasma localization as the independent variable and the presence of neo\u2010Y as the dependent.

First, the X1 and the proximal half of the X2 in X1X2Y and X1X2X3Y systems show the metaphase behavior of ancestral X material, because they lie side by side without chiasmata, and because they appear less condensed (heteropycnotic) than the autosomes (e.g., Fig. 3D)\u2014as do the X1 and X2 in X1X20 species. In contrast, the distal half of the X2, all of the X3, and the Y of X1X2Y and X1X2X3Y systems behave like the autosomes in pairing and in condensation patterns. Second, with the exception of Habronattus banksi and Habronattus pochetecanus, X1X2Y species have 12 pairs of acrocentric autosomes and X1X2X3Y have 11 pairs.",

The ancestral state in Habronattus is an X1X20 sex chromosome system by both likelihood and parsimony. This is consistent with the widespread occurrence of X1X20 system in salticids and other spiders (Araujo et al. 2005, 2012; Kr\u00e1l et al. 2006). The Mk1 likelihood reconstruction on the BEAST tree (Fig. 4A) shows X1X20 on most internal nodes, with X1X2Y or X1X2X3Y systems evolving independently 13 times, six of which are in the viridipes and coecatus groups. The Mk1Ordered reconstruction is nearly the same, except that ambiguity in the viridipes group suggests as an alternative a single origin of Y (via X1X2Y) within the group (Fig. 4A, inset). If H. cf. paratus (Sucumbios), not included because of lack of molecular data, were included on this tree in its presumed location as sister to H. paratus, the number of origins of neo\u2010Y systems would rise to 14. Similarly, inclusion of the northern X1X2X3Y population of H. cuspidatus would likely raise the number of origins to 15. The apparent phylogenetic misplacement of H. notialis, H. jucundus and H. calcaratus calcaratus has little effect on our results, as this introduced no false origins of neo\u2010Y (all have X1X20) and none of these species were measured for chiasma localization.",

Because the transition from X1X20 to X1X2Y involves a gain of a Y as well as a reduction in autosome number, reversion to X1X20 would require the X2 be dissociated at the old X\u2010autosome boundary and a centromere reconstituted, so as to recover the extra autosome pair.

White (1969) does not present his phylogenetic reasoning, but concludes that morabine grasshoppers have had 11 independent X\u2010autosome fusions and five independent Y\u2010autosome fusions among the 170 sampled species.

This and the phylogenetic distribution of neo\u2010Ys in many isolated species (Fig. 4) are consistent with recent origins. Three clades, however, have multiple species that share an apparently homologous Y chromosome: the H. dorotheae group (2 species, Habronattus geronimoi and H. sp.

The localization across all autosomes suggests there was an evolutionary change that affected all chromosomes, as found also by Colombo (1989). In this regard, our data differ from those of Bidau et al. (2001), who found that distal localization was confined to those chromosomes involved in the fusions. The one species for which a direct mechanical response remains a possibility is H. sp. (CHUAST) Chiapas.
