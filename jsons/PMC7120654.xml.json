            "text": "The IL-12 family was formed with the discovery of IL-12, a heterodimer of p35 (encoded by Il12a) and p40 (encoded by Il12b), linked by disulfide bonds (Fig. 15.1). This family is characterized by heterodimers of alpha-subunits consistent with the structure of type 1 cytokines and beta-subunits that are structurally similar to soluble cytokine receptors (Jones and Vignali 2011; Vignali and Kuchroo 2012). This structure thought to have evolved from the IL-6 superfamily of cytokines. Many IL-6 superfamily members utilize gp130 as a signal-transducing subunit (IL-6, IL-11, CNTF, LIF, OSM, CLF, etc.). Beta-subunits structurally resemble signal-transducing subunits as well as cytokine-binding proteins (Jones and Vignali 2011). IL-12 was shown to be critical for induction of T helper 1 (Th1) cell differentiation and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production. The generation of knockout mice for Il12a and Il12b confirms the physiological importance of IL-12 in a variety of in vivo models, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Bettelli et al. 2007). As the Th1/Th2 paradigm suggested that Th1 cells would be important for EAE disease pathogenesis, it was anticipated that Il12b\n\u2212/\u2212 mice would be resistant to EAE. However, the observation that Il12a\n\u2212/\u2212 were susceptible to EAE was surprising and suggested a more complex biology. This idea prompted researchers to suggest that perhaps p40 was playing a role as a subunit for another cytokine, leading to the discovery of the p19 alpha-chain and the demonstration that it pairs with the p40 beta-chain via a disulfide linkage to form IL-23. This new cytokine, while originally thought to activate memory cells, was shown to induce the differentiation of Th17 cells, a predominantly inflammatory T cell subset. In the coming years, new cytokines have be added to the IL-12 family based on structural homology. IL-27, a heterodimer of p28 (encoded by Il27) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus-induced gene 3 (Ebi3, encoded by Ebi3), which lacks disulfide linkage, was shown to be produced by recently activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (Fig. 15.1). It was first thought to be a proinflammatory cytokine, because stimulation of na\u00efve T cells with IL-27 induces Il12rb2 expression, greatly enhancing T-cell sensitivity to IL-12 (Devergne et al. 1996; Hall et al. 2012). However, recent data have highlighted a more immunomodulatory role for IL-27. For instance, IL-27 can induce the generation of IL-10-producing Tr1 cells while inhibiting Th17 and peripherally induced Treg (pTreg) induction. It is also notable that several IL-12 family member subunits have been suggested to have functional roles as homodimers. IL12p40 homodimers, p28 homodimers (IL-30), and Ebi3 homodimers have been reported with various functions resulting from their antagonistic activity via receptor blockade (Hall et al. 2012; Kempe et al. 2009; Vignali and Kuchroo 2012). Recently, p28 has been shown to have an agonistic function in T cells, although it remains to be determined whether these homodimers have physiological roles in vivo (Garbers et al. 2013).\n\n",

            "text": "A decade later, detailed analysis of the Treg cell gene expression \u201csignature\u201d revealed Ebi3 as an upregulated gene and potential Foxp3 target (Collison et al. 2007; Hill et al. 2007; Knoechel et al. 2006; Zheng et al. 2007). Given that Ebi3 is a p40-related member of the IL-12 family, a cytokine family that was thought to be exclusively produced by APCs, increased expression in Treg cells was surprising. In 2007, the Vignali lab identified IL-35 as a p35:Ebi3 heterodimer important for Treg cell function (Collison et al. 2007). Importantly, Ebi3- and Il12a-deficient Treg cells, stimulated in isolation or co-cultured with wild-type conventional cells, displayed limited suppressive capabilities compared with their wild-type controls. Furthermore, recombinant 2A-linked \u201cnative\u201d or a single-chain \u201chyperkine\u201d IL-35 suppressed T-cell proliferation. Around the same time, another group used a p35:Ebi3 single-chain hyperkine-Fc fusion protein to abrogate collagen-induced arthritis in mice (Niedbala et al. 2007). However, this study seemed to indicate a role for IL-35 in the expansion of Tregs rather than the suppression of proliferation. These contrasting data in vitro confirmed some earlier observations, but a physiological role and source for IL-35 in vivo seemed to be lacking (Devergne et al. 1997; Niedbala et al. 2007). In all, these early observations suggested that IL-35 may be an important member of the suppressive cytokine \u201ccommunity,\u201d joining transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and IL-10 as soluble mediators of suppression.",

Although there is clearly much to learn about this intriguing cytokine, several recent studies have begun to provide important insight into its function (Fig. 15.2). The primary function of IL-35 appears to be the induction of cell-cycle arrest in many cell types (Bettini et al. 2012; Collison et al. 2007; Wirtz et al. 2011). The ability of IL-35 to suppress cellular proliferation may be a critical component of the Treg cell armament, especially in inflammatory environments (Bettini et al. 2012; Collison et al. 2007, 2009; Wirtz et al. 2011). It has been suggested that IL-35 can expand Treg cells, although the mechanism of this expansion is unknown and the observation has yet to be confirmed in vivo (Niedbala et al. 2007). It is possible that that Treg cells are merely resistant to IL-35 and thus are selected for in this context, or it may be that IL-35 blocks factors that would hamper Treg cell function.\n\n",

Initial studies suggested that IL-35 could ameliorate inflammatory environments, such as in models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Collison et al. 2007). Early in vivo functions of IL-35 were attributed to the expansion of regulatory cells or the suppression of Th17 cells, specifically in the progression of experimental arthritis (Kochetkova et al. 2010; Niedbala et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2008). IL-35 was also shown to be important in inhibiting the clearance of Listeria infection (Yang et al. 2008). Ebi3\n\u2212/\u2212 animals have exacerbated central nervous system (CNS) pathology in response to coronavirus infection (Tirotta et al. 2013). Use of an IL-35 expression construct in mice led to attenuated autoimmune-induced CNS demyelination (Zandian et al. 2011), decreased experimental colitis (Wirtz et al. 2011), and reduced severity of airway inflammation and antibody production in a model of dust mite allergy (Huang et al. 2011). Transgenic NOD mice expressing IL-35 in pancreatic beta cells in the islets of Langerhans have substantially decreased diabetes and immune pathology (Bettini et al. 2012). Further analysis of IL-35 function in vivo is clearly required, but the general consensus is that IL-35 exhibits an inhibitory phenotype in a broad range of disease models.",

It seemed logical that IL-35 might have a similar function as a mediator of \u201cinfectious tolerance,\u201d the notion that cells which are suppressed can themselves become suppressive, passing the tolerant state from one cell to another (Gravano and Vignali 2012). Indeed, naive CD4+ T cells stimulated in the presence of IL-35 are not only suppressed but are converted to an IL-35-producing iTreg population termed iTr35 (Collison et al. 2010). Interestingly, these cells do not express Foxp3 or suppress via TGF-\u03b2 or IL-10 and are implicated in several disease models, especially cancer, as tumors are enriched for Foxp3\u2013 IL-35-producing cells.",

            "text": "Although there is mounting evidence supporting an inhibitory role for murine IL-35, evidence supporting a role for human IL35 remains limited. It has been suggested that human IL-35 may be suppressive (Collison et al. 2010; Jones et al. 2012), but initial studies could not detect IL-35 production by human Treg cells ex vivo or following short-term stimulation (Bardel et al. 2008). Furthermore, retroviral-mediated overexpression of FOXP3 in human T cells could not induce EBI3 or IL12A expression (Allan et al. 2008). However, most Treg cells isolated from human samples are not particularly suppressive ex vivo and do not always express high levels of FOXP3. Indeed, IL-35 has been detectable in human samples from a variety of disease states (Langhans et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2011; Seyerl et al. 2010). Furthermore, hepatitis C virus-specific human Tregs have been shown to suppress via IL-35 in response to HCV epitopes (Langhans et al. 2010). IL-35 has also been shown to be produced by human Tregs in response to rhinovirus infection, implicating PD-L1 and CD169 in its induction (Seyerl et al. 2010). As in the mouse, it also appears that human CD4+ T cells exposed to IL-35 can express and mediate suppression via IL-35 (Collison et al. 2010). Although most of the focus has been on production of IL-35 by CD4+ regulatory T-cell populations, an intriguing recent study has suggested that a human CD8+ T-cell subpopulation can regulate antitumor immunity in prostate cancer via IL-35 production and CTLA-4 (Olson et al. 2012). This finding is particularly intriguing because CD8+ cells express a functional receptor for IL-35 that could induce IL-35 production (Collison et al. 2012). Also recently, a study has suggested that IL-35 may be produced by tumor cells, inducing cell-cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis among themselves as well as tumor-infiltrating cells (Long et al. 2013). Some cancer lines were also shown to express functional receptors for IL-35 as well as IL-35 itself. Furthermore, IL-35-negative tumor lines in which IL-35 was overexpressed gained the ability to mediate cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (Long et al. 2013). This ability may serve as a mechanism for tumors to evade the immune system and establish long-term tolerance, promoting disease progression. Such observations are encouraging, but it will be critical to fully evaluate the functional capacity and scope of human IL-35, moving forward to determine the potential of its therapeutic utilization or blockade.",

            "text": "Based on structural homology between the subunits of IL-35 and other members of the IL-12 family, it was likely that IL-35 would utilize one or more of the receptor subunits associated with this family. Utilizing cells deficient in these receptor subunits, we demonstrated a role for gp130 and IL-12R\u03b22 in IL-35-mediated suppression (Collison et al. 2012). However, although gp130- and IL-12R\u03b22 double-deficient cells were completely resistant to IL-35-mediated suppression, those lacking only a single chain of the receptor could still signal and suppress, especially in vivo. This observation was surprising as other members of the IL-12 family lose their signaling capacity in the absence of a single receptor chain (Garbers et al. 2012; Vignali and Kuchroo 2012). Intriguingly, signaling via gp130 or IL-12R\u03b22 alone was not sufficient to mediate IL-35 production and iTr35 conversion. Subsequent biochemical analysis and microscopy approaches revealed that IL-35 can utilize three receptors: gp130 homodimers and IL-12R\u03b22 homodimers, which were sufficient to mediate suppression, and gp130:IL12R\u03b22 heterodimers, which mediate suppression and iTr35 conversion (Fig. 15.3). This conversion occurs through STAT1:STAT4 heterodimers, which can bind to regions within the Ebi3 and Il12a promoters and initiate transcription. What remains unclear is how gp130 or IL-12R\u03b22 homodimers can stimulate STAT1 or STAT4 activation and mediate suppression in the absence of the other chain.\n\n",

Interestingly, CD8+ regulatory cells generated in prostate tumors have been shown to suppress via IL-35 production, suggesting that perhaps the presence of IL-12R\u03b22 and gp130 on activated CD8+ T cells may sensitize them for conversion to IL-35 production (Olson et al. 2012). However, gp130 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body. As IL-35 can mediate suppression through gp130 homodimers, this implies that most cells could be susceptible to IL-35-mediated suppression. This is an exciting thought but it highlights questions regarding the potency of IL-35 in vivo and implications for clinical use. Does IL-35-mediated Treg suppression require closer contact and direct delivery to its target cells? Is IL-35 removed from the microenvironment by the myriad of receptor-positive cells in vivo? Is there a method for therapeutic intervention by which one could specifically deliver IL-35 to its intended targets, sparing gp130+ bystander cells?",

            "text": "IL-35 has proven to be an extraordinarily hard cytokine to study. A key issue is that purified biologically active recombinant IL-35 is still not commercially available and has not been reported. This restriction is in part because IL-35 is poorly secreted and may be somewhat unstable (Jones et al. 2012). Generally Fc fusion proteins or hyperkines are used to study heterodimeric cytokines (such as IL-27), but attempts to generate functional IL-35 in this manner have had mixed results. Although 293T cells coexpressing p35 and Ebi3 secrete bioactive IL-35, the amount is low and it has not been successful purified (Collison et al. 2007, 2009; Jones et al. 2012). Important studies are being undertaken currently to determine the fundamental biology of IL-35, which may help shed light on problems with its production and purification as a research reagent. Interestingly, p35 utilizes two potential start codons, the first encoding a nonclassical, extraordinarily long signal peptide (Kollet et al. 2001; Vaidyanathan et al. 2001, 2003), raising the possibility that IL-35 may be processed differently than are other cytokines. These hypotheses parallel the initial observations that Ebi3 may also be membrane associated and have alternative processing (Devergne et al. 1996). Solving these inherent problems in IL-35 expression, production, and purification may help elucidate the biology of this mysterious cytokine. Such studies may pave the way for future use of IL-35 as a research reagent and a tool for therapeutic intervention.",

For instance, Il12a\n\u2212/\u2212 mice lack both IL-35 and IL-12, thus clouding whether the phenotype observed is caused by one cytokine or the other. An attractive idea would be to find sites in Ebi3 and p35 that would mediate binding with IL-12, IL-27, or IL-35, respectively, and make mutant mice that would thus be deficient in only one cytokine, rather than both (Vignali and Kuchroo 2012). Given that IL-35 is a heterodimeric cytokine, one might anticipate that mutations could be made that would abrogate binding to one binding partner versus the other. However, extensive mutagenesis of Ebi3 and p35 has suggested that this may not be the case. Although IL-12 and IL-27 have conserved regions of homology crucial to subunit pairing, p35 and Ebi3 appear to pair in an unconventional manner (Jones et al. 2012). However, using point mutants discovered by these mutagenesis studies could pave the way for generation of mice that are specifically deficient in IL-12 or IL-27, leaving IL-35 pairing and function intact.",
