These concerns can only be allayed by the intelligent use of perioperative antibiotics in well defined indications. Preferred prophylactic antibiotics should be nontoxic, inexpensive, and possess activity against the major pathogens likely to be encountered in the operative area. However, the antibiotics need not be active against every bacterial species present in the operative area. A very limited role exists for the second generation agent cefoxitin, and no indication exists for the third generation cephalosporins cefotaxime, moxalactam, and cefoperazone for perioperative pro phyla xi^.^ These more expensive agents have not been found to be more effective than less expensive agents, and their unrestrained use could encourage the emergence of drug-resistant organisms.",

Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, consisting of a change in the color, consistency and amount of sputum as well as increasing cough and dyspnea, have been ascribed to viruses (rhinovirus, coronavi rus, influenza) , Mycoplasma pneumoniae and bacteria, including Haemophilis influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, gram-negative bacilli and \"normal respiratory flora.\" Antibiotics have been prescribed to shorten the duration of the exacerbation, prevent respiratory failure or forestall progressive pulmonary deterioration that often occurs in patients with chronic bronchitis. No evidence has emerged that antibiotics can accomplish any of these desired goals.

For patients with normal host defenses drainage is adequate therapy, and antibiotics are not indicated. I 3 In addition to the problem of prescribing antibiotics for disorders in which no benefit has been established, physicians often equate \"best\" treatment with the newest, invariably more expensive, antibiotic. Penicillin G remains the drug of choice for pneumococcal pneumonia, community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, dental infections, streptococcal pharyngitis and syphilis. Although the more expensive cephalosporins possess an expanded spectrum of activity, cure rates are not improved by prescribing these antibiotics instead of penicillin. Only when controlled studies show enhanced efficacy or reduced toxicity should the newer, more expensive agent be prescribed. Similarly, the inexpensive sulfonamides remain highly effective agents to treat communityacquired symptomatic bacterial cystitis in women.14 In the absence of a history of an allergic reaction to sulfonamide, there is no reason to prescribe the more expensive compounds, such as cefaclor, cephalexin, cefadroxil, nitrofuratoin or trimethoprimsulfame-thoxazole, when treating a woman with symptomatic, community-associated bacterial cystitis.",

Tobramycin is also preferred by some experts for treating patients with renal insufficiency who have infections requiring an aminoglycoside; the rationale 243 is based on a lower frequency of nephrotoxicity, as measured by serum creatinine values. Amikacin should be selected to treat infections caused by Proteus vulgaris or Providencia stuarfii while awaiting susceptibility reports. For patients with nosocomial gram negative infections requiring an aminoglycoside, tobramycin or amikacin should be selected initially if gentamicin resistant strains are prevalent in the hospital.

Adults with disseminated gonococcal infection can be effectively treated with a one week program consisting initially of 2 million units of penicillin G administered every 4 hours followed by oral ampicillin or amoxicillin prescribed as 500 mg four times daily.34,35 Hospitalization is usually recommended to establish the diagnosis of disseminated gonococcal disease since misdiagnosis occurs not infrequently with this disorder.33 Selected patients can complete the oral regimens in an outpatient setting or, alternatively, they can be treated entirely without ho~pitalization.~~ Acceptable oral regimens consist of giving amoxicillin (500 mg four times daily), tetracycline (500 mg four times daily), or erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) for at least 7 days. 35 The following requirements should be met before home treatment is recommended: the diagnosis should be well established; the patient should be considered compliant; complications, such as purulent joint effusions, must be COST-EFFECTIVE ANTI B IOTlC PRESCRIBING Gleckman and Ganfz 245 absent; and the patient must be able to return for follow-up observations. The standard treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis consists of the combination of isoniazid (INH)ethambutol, INH-rifampin, or rifampin-ethambutol prescribed for 18-24 months. Prolonged chemotherapy is expensive and is associated with compliance and toxicity problems. Studies have confirmed that specific regimens given for 6 to 12 months to adults with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis are as effective as more prolonged therapy and have the advantage of being less expensive and well tolerated.36s 37 Short course treatment regimens for adults consist of administering INH (300 mg) and rifampin (600 mg) daily for 6 to 12 months. If the patient has had previous antituberculosis therapy or has emigrated from an area such as Asia or Africa, where high levels of initial drug resistance exist, then the INH-rifampin should be supplemented with streptomycin (12-25 mg/kg), pyrazinamide (30 mg/kg), or ethambutol ( 1 5 2 5 mg/kg) daily for the first 2 months, pending the results of susceptibility tests. If resistance to INH or rifampin is found by susceptibility tests, then short course chemotherapy is not indicated. A regimen should be selected using two or three drugs to which the organisms are susceptible, and it should be given for a period of 18 to 24 months.38 For the abbreviated treatment to be successful, patient compliance is critical. Patients should be seen monthly, pill counts should be performed, urines should be tested for the presence of INH and rifampin, and bacteriologic examinations of sputum must be done. Treatment should be continued until at least 6 months have elapsed from the time of conversion of the sputum culture from positive to negative. For most patients, the total duration of therapy will be 9 months. Patients should be followed closely for 1 year after completing the short course regimen in order to detect relapse. For noncompliant patients, after an initial phase of daily INHrifampin treatment administered for 1 to 2 months, therapy can be continued twice-weekly with INH (15 mg/kg) and rifampin (600 mg) for 7 to 10 months. 38 The medications must be administered under supervision, and patients who receive intermittent rifampin should be monitored for the development of thrombocytopenia and a \"flu syndrome.\" These abbreviated treatments cannot be recommended for children, for patients harboring drug-resistant organisms, for patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, for patients with unique predisposing concomitant disease, such as silicosis or diabetes, or patients who have experienced previous drug failure or microbiological relapse.",

Successful home intravenous programs have included patients with hemophilia who receive clotting factors, patients with parenteral alimentation, and patients sustained by chronic hemodialysis. In 1974, Rucker and Harrison were the first investigators to report on the use of intravenously administered antibiotics given in the home.43 Sixty-two children with cystic fibrosis were treated at home with either intravenous gentamicin or colistimethate for the management of Pseudomonas-related pulmonary infections. In that study, 127 infectious episodes were treated at home, resulting in a 68% reduction in the need for hospitalization. The patients were seen once weekly, and no major complications were noted.43 Subsequent reports on parenteral administration of antibiotics at home appeared in 1 978,455 46 (Table 5) and to date 363 patients have been treated at five centers in the United States and Almost half of the patients (150) were treated at home in a program developed at the Fairfax Hospital, a large community-teaching hospital in the Washington, D.C. area. 44 Patients selected for home treatment are considered to have responded satisfactorily to the intravenous program initiated in the hospital and require only a more extended course of intravenous antibiotics. Home intravenous programs are coordinated by a team consisting of infectious disease specialists, pharmacists and nurses skilled in performing intravenous infusion. One to two days prior to discharge the patients and a family member are taught the techniques necessary to care for an i.v. cannula. The cannula is changed twice a week at home by a visiting nurse or in the hospital's outpatient department. The duration of home i.v. therapy averaged two to three weeks. In each of the published series, patients with osteomyelitis and septic arthritis have predominated, but patients with other infections have also been successfully managed (Table 5) . A vast array of antibiotics have been used, and the solutions, which have been prepared in the hospital pharmacy, are kept refrigerated at home. Antibiotics with long half-lives, such as cefazolin, are preferred since they permit dosing every six or eight hours. Patients may be given a four or five day supply of antibiotic, depending on the stability of the drug, and they are instructed to return to the outpatient department once or twice weekly to have their progress evaluated. All studies have monitored patients for cornplications of the initial infection, compliance, adverse effects, including antibiotic toxicities and i.v. compli-cations, and superinfection. To date, all programs have confirmed the safety and efficacy of this form of therapy. Long-term follow-up is not available in all of the studies, but short term efficacy data parallel the experience of in-hospital care.44 Patients have been able to return to work and to school.",
