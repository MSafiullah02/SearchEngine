It was observed that the detection rate of the NS1 antigen decreased from 100% in early disease (\u22645 days) to 61.53% in those presenting with seven or more days of fever, and thus, emphasized the role of antigen detection in early disease.",

In support are observations of Smith et al, and others.[513] Neutrophil counts were in normal range in a majority of the cases.

Of these, 50% had at least one week duration of disease. Acute hepatitis showed a rise in aminotransferase levels, with peak levels on the ninth day and return to normal within three weeks.
