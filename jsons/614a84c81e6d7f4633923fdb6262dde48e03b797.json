As the growth of infection slows, decisions regarding easing of lockdown restrictions are required, keeping in view the capacity of the health-care system. In this paper, we quantify the impact of a multi-phased release of the population from lockdown. Using the SIR model for epidemic spread, we design and implement a method to determine the earliest time of release from lockdown restrictions, constrained by a specified threshold on the subsequent peaks of infection. Trade-offs between the threshold and the earliest times of removing lockdown restrictions are illustrated. Additionally, we consider alternative policy decisions where the population is released gradually from lockdown restrictions and illustrate the trade-offs between the rate of release of population and number of active infections.",

The lockdown phase, effectively a quarantine, removes a fraction of the population from contacting the infection. Upon removal of the restriction, the virus would possibly infect the population that emerges from lockdown, starting a new infection spreading phase and resulting in new peaks of infections. Lockdowns have been used in the current pandemic with degrees of success, depending on the fraction of population that respects the lockdown. The lockdown was enforced strictly in China, as well as in Italy and Spain, but these policies were implemented after the infection had spread considerably. While the lockdown has the impact of reducing the infection spread amongst a sizeable fraction of susceptible people, evidence that easing of lockdown restrictions could possibly restart the infection process can be found in recent reports [2] . The need for reducing the stress on the healthcare system [3] requires an analysis of the behavior of the infection spread after the periods of lockdown end. The US has the largest number of active infectious cases and is undergoing considerably stress [4] on the healthcare system. This indicates need for the study of a strategically timed release from lockdown.",

We utilize an algorithm that provides the earliest time of removal of restrictions of lockdown while containing the spread of the disease to within a threshold. Two scenarios are considered, one where the restrictions are eliminated in phases and the other where the population is released from lockdown gradually, as will likely occur. We utilize analysis of epidemic spread models, more specifically the SIR [5, 6] model (originally from [7] [8] [9] ). There have been multiple analysis on the COVID-19 pandemic that model its spread including some that account for lack of complete reporting, a problem that further complicates the modeling process [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Our methods require the initial susceptible population and the infection rates. A regression method is used to fit the model to provide estimates of the parameters of the standard epidemic model. We then use an optimization method to determine the earliest release times for the population under lockdown. The fraction of population under lockdown is estimated using mobility data. Our algorithms to determine the trade-offs utilize a discrete time recurrence to model the behavior of the spread of infection; this models the dynamics of the disease and is also found in the seminal works by . To determine the earliest time of release, our algorithm relies on monotonicity properties of the solution and a logarithmic search over the space of parameters. The results illustrate that sufficiently delayed and controlled release of lockdown is essential. We note that applications to public policy decisions require multiple other factors including demographics. Publicly available data from multiple repositories [19, 20] and the states of Illinois and New York are used to illustrate the method.",

In the analysis, a fraction of the population, h, that is under lockdown is eliminated from consideration during the initial stages of the infection, and is then re-introduced into the model when the lockdown restrictions are relaxed. Removal of restrictions of the lockdown impacts the susceptible population. We consider two strategies for removal of restrictions. In the first strategy restrictions are relaxed on an equal fraction of the population at distinct times and we determine the earliest time of such release, subject to conditions on growth of active cases. In the second scenario the population is released gradually in small fractions over time and we determined the impact of the release strategy on the number of active cases. We focus on the number of active cases as this metric is important for health-care systems. The current population under lockdown is estimated using the mobility numbers to roughly 50% average (The Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports [23] indicate a 45% decrease in transit and workplace mobility in New York). The analysis of the spread of the infection utilized both the SIR and SEIR models, and in order to fit the models we minimized an error function. The parameter space includes the size of the initial susceptible population, \u03b2 and \u03b3, the parameter for recovery time, guided by reports that the typical recovery time have a mean value of 14 days [24]. However the recovery data did not indicate a mean recovery period of 14 days but a much longer period. We describe the determination of the model parameter in a later section 4. Details of these parameter estimates are provided for two states, Illinois and New York . The SIR model provided a more accurate fit of the model and is used in our results on release strategies.",

This population cannot be introduced before the peak of infection, measured by the number of active cases and is illustrated in Figure 1 where the active cases grow substantially when a fraction of the population is released from the lockdown just around or before the peak. In both the states, gradual reopening at a rate of 1.5% of the population under lockdown results in a spike of cases ( Figure 1) , with Illinois projected to be worse.

This relationship can be used to determine the lockdown release expressed as a percentage of the peak of active infections, given a threshold percentage TH of the first peak of active infection cases that can be afforded by the health-care system without stress. As an example, if the health-care system has the capacity to handle 75% of the first peak, then the release of the lockdown should be at around 50 percent drop from the peak active cases in Illinois. For New York, the corresponding drop is estimated at 50%. In terms of number of days till removal of restrictions, Figure 5 illustrates the relationship between the earliest release day of the first phase, as a percentage of the day to the peak infection rate versus threshold percentage, TH, that the active infected cases are to be limited to. As an example, in Illinois, the relationship shows that to limit further infections to TH value of 75% of the active infection peak cases under lockdown, reopening the economy should start after waiting for at least 1.5 times the number of days to the first peak. This is more applicable to counties which are most affected by the spread of infection. 8 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

We sampled over multiple dates to find the best fit, i.e., that minimizes the error function above (we in fact maximized the R 2 value since we needed to normalize the two function f 1 and f 2 ). After some experimentation, we choose \u03b1 1 = 0.3 and the convex combination weights inside f 2 for I (t) and R (t) were 0.7 and 0.3, respectively. There is the distinct possibility and drawback of an over-fit but given the sparsity of the recovery data the determination of the degree of overfit was not conducted in this current version. The parameters obtained are \u03b2 = 22.80, \u03b3 = 0.00554, \u03b7 = 0.005724 for Illinois and \u03b2 = 10.41, \u03b3 = 0.01863, \u03b7 = 0.016788 for New York.
