            "text": "The RdRp is one out of four categories of polymerases and its crystal structure shows a close evolutionary relationship not only to other RdRps but also to that of DNA-dependent DNA-polymerases (DdDps), DNA-dependent RNA-polymerases (DdRps), and RNA-dependent DNA-polymerases (RdDps) also known as reverse transcriptases (RTs). All resemble a cupped right-handed structure consisting of the thumb, fingers, and palm subdomains [16, 17]. The palm is where the active site of the polymerase lies and consists of four conserved structural motifs A\u2013D [16]. A fifth and sixth motif, E and F, exists in the RNA-dependent polymerases but not the DNA-dependent polymerases [16]. The latter motifs are not in the active site but line this region. RdRps are error prone but they are as faithful as DNA polymerases that lack proofreading exonucleases [18]. The absence of a repair mechanism in the PV genome is what leads to an enhanced rate of mutation during viral replication.",

Recently, the chemical mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer has been expanded to include a general acid, which protonates the pyrophosphate leaving group of the NTP substrate and enhance the efficiency of nucleotidyl transfer [20, 21]. The general acid of PV RdRp is Lys359, located in motif D, which is conserved throughout all RdRps and RTs. Importantly, an orthologous residue at this site is known or predicted in RNA viruses for which rational design of vaccines would greatly benefit.",

Quantification of virus by plaque assay provides insight into fitness of the viral population. The subgenomic replicon permits indirect evaluation of RNA synthesis by measurement of luciferase activity. Analysis of RNA replication in the absence of virus production can provide insight on whether RNA replication is the rate-limiting step for virus production.",

However, viral quantification by plaque forming units (pfu) selects variants based on phenotype and therefore can be an unreliable measure of viruses present due to phenotypic differences between viral strains. In addition to pfu, quantifying virus based on genomes accounts for total viral particles produced. This is a more accurate measurement of total viruses in the population and the number of genomes produced by the polymerase.",

In this system, wild-type (WT) PV is generally lethal. At the highest dose, the mutated polymerase (lysine to arginine) failed to cause disease in the mice. To determine if the mutant virus replicated, mice surviving the initial infection were challenged with a lethal dose of WT PV. We can conclude from the mice that survive this challenge, the mutant is replication competent and elicits an immune response sufficient enough to protect against a lethal dose of WT PV [3].",

By altering the nature of the general acid lysine residue to an arginine, we have shown that we maintain the ability to tune RdRp speed and fidelity creating a viral RdRp that is slower and more faithful than the WT enzyme. This results in an attenuated virus with a restricted viral quasispecies that fails to cause disease, yet elicits a protective immune response.

This genetic reversion requires two transversion mutations, which is a very inefficient event thus providing some barrier to reversion.When using new primers, test the efficiency of the reaction by titrating in MgSO4. Set up 3\u2013100 \u03bcL reactions and add 0, 1, and 2 \u03bcL of the 100 mM MgSO4. Run 10 \u03bcL of completed product on agarose gel to check efficiency of reaction. Combine the successful reaction tubes and precipitate out DNA for gel purification.Combine water, cDNA and buffer in 1.7 mL tube and before adding enzyme to your reaction, remove 5 \u03bcL from the tube and set aside. This will be your \u201cuncut\u201d sample. Add the enzyme and allow reaction to proceed at proper temperature. After incubation remove another 5 \u03bcL from the tube. This will be your \u201ccut\u201d sample.The number of colonies after successful ligation and transformation of cloned pMoVRA and pRLucRA yield different results. When plating 100 % of your transformed cells, the pMoVRA clone should yield roughly 50 colonies on a plate, whereas the pRLucRA clone will yield at most 100 colonies.Multiple freeze thaws of virus stock will overtime lower the titer of the virus. To avoid this, make small aliquots of virus and store at \u221280 \u00b0C. Never use a stock tube that has been thawed more than three times after a titer or genome copy has been determined.There are two reasons why it is important to passage virus at a low MOI. First is to check the stability of the engineered mutation by sequencing the mutated region; second is to generate a quasispecies.\n",
