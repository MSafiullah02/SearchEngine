According to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report,(1) schools in unsatisfactory condition can be found in every part of the country. More than 14 million children are being taught in school buildings needing significant repairs to restore them to good overall condition. To compound this problem, the definition of a \u201cclean\u201d environment in educational facilities is lacking at present. Meeting the challenge in setting practitioner-based cleaning protocols today must be based on the relationship between our understanding of the term \u201cclean\u201d and its relationship to the health of occupants. Today, the professional cleaning industry has moved toward the approach of \u201ccleaning for health first and appearance second,\u201d based on three decades of investigation and research that has characterized the building ecosystem, in addition to the assessment of occupant exposures and potential health risks.",

Rarely are quantitative measurements of the surfaces and materials that are cleaned and sanitized required in support of the visual assessment. This is unfortunate, as cleaning practices and procedures may be adequate according to an eyeball assessment but inadequate for the efficient removal of unwanted and less visible substances such as biological residue pollutants. As a result, ecological sub-compartments (reservoirs) have been identified that can collect and retain pollutants that without adequate cleaning (physical removal of biologically derived surface soiling/cleanliness residuals invisible to the naked eye) can become active disseminators (sources) of potentially infectious agents.",

Using this data to generate \u201ctypical\u201d ranges of pre- and post-ATP or RODAC data can be conducted based on a statistical approach often used to describe such distributions. Since about 95% of values drawn from a normal distribution are within two SD away from the mean and about 68% of the values are within one SD, we calculated typical ranges for log-transformed data based on 5% trimmed mean \u00b1 2SD. In most cases, typical range is approximately \u00b11 log from the mean. Defining what may be acceptable as a reasonable range of values in schools can be based on a more rigorous criteria derived statistically. The range corresponding to a value less than (or equal to) +1SD from the 5% trimmed mean was calculated and referred to as a reasonable range, i.e., values that are not extraordinarily high. These typical and reasonable ranges are presented in Tables V (pre-cleaning) and VI (post-cleaning) as log-transformed data.\n\n",

However, post-cleaning correlations between ATP and RODAC were weaker and not statistically significant (Pearson correlations 0.03\u20130.19), and in general, higher correlations were observed between different ATP systems (pre-cleaning 0.31\u20130.45, post-cleaning 0.19\u20130.34). The reason for relatively weak/moderate correlations between different systems could be partly related to the systems themselves, but also, it appears there can be considerable differences in ATP levels across surfaces. Thus, a sample taken adjacent to another sample could have a vastly different reading. It is therefore prudent that assessment of cleaning effectiveness is based on large enough sample size (i.e., in this study 10 samples per surface type per school).

ATP is an excellent candidate marker for the monitoring of biologically derived surface soiling/cleanliness, since most surfaces collect and retain soils, dusts, and various deposits containing a myriad of particles and fragments of biological origin, including those from plants (such as pollens, fibers, dusts, and so on) and animals (skin cells, dander, insect parts, secretions, exudates, and so on), as well as microorganisms that are environmentally ubiquitous.

Reasonable range values from this study have been established and may be factored into a standardized approach to the routine monitoring of cleaning effectiveness based on detection and quantification of pollutant loads of biological origin in school buildings. Data also revealed a reduction of culturable bacteria coincident with ATP reduction after cleaning. Specific ATP values/ranges appear to be a function of both surface material type and location within a school building, and further study in school buildings across the United States is expected to confirm unique values for such critical compartments of the school building ecosystem.",
