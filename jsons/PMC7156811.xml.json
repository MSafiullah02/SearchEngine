Wildlife is traded for a multitude of purposes, including for pet purposes, food, medicine, luxury products, and collectable items (Baker et al 2013; Nijman 2010). Unregulated commercial trade and unsustainable harvesting from wild populations lead to increased extinction risks for many taxa around the world (Tingley et al 2017). Traditionally, the platforms of trade have strictly been limited to physical trading areas ranging from city markets, border markets, trading hubs at ports, and stores (Zhang et al 2008). Using data of live animals sold in local markets throughout East and Southeast Asia, Karesh et al (2005) conservatively estimated that tens of millions of wild animals are shipped across the region each year for food and medicine.",

Theoretically, the complex interactions of markets, both physical and online markets, as well as legal and illegal, have been explored to a limited extent (Fischer 2004). To date, there have only been a number of studies that examined this market place transition quantitatively. The challenges in making direct comparisons between physical markets and online platforms range from disjointed time periods, nuanced social differences in consumer buying behavior, as well as differences in survey methods and efforts. Nijman et al (2019) directly compared open animal markets and online markets in trade of wild cats and revealed that there is indeed a directional shift of trade toward online platforms but this differs generally between countries. An increased presence of enforcement agencies in many traditional markets may have also contributed to the shift; however, the rate of change occurs at varying degrees dependent on factors such as geographic location and infrastructure limitations.",

Birds are arguably one of the most popularly traded taxa, contributing as the most species rich and abundant class of wildlife traded legally based on records from 2006 to 2012 (Bush et al 2013). Traditionally, birds are kept as pets in many societies around the world but probably no where more so than in Southeast Asia (Lin, 2005, Nijman et al., 2018). However, not all of this trade is regulated and sustainable; over a third of bird species are impacted by overexploitation (Harris et al., 2017, Reuter et al., 2019). Trade has also been cited as the second most significant threat to migratory birds (Brochet et al 2016).",

            "text": "The trade of live diurnal birds of prey (Falconiformes and Accipitriformes), commonly referred to as raptors, contributes to a significant proportion of the avian trade (Panter et al 2018). Raptors are legally and illegally traded for recreational hunting or falconry, especially in the Middle East and USA, or for them to be kept as pets (Nijman et al., 2009, Wyatt, 2009, Rold\u00e1n-Clar\u00e0 et al., 2014, MaMing et al., 2014). Although not common, in some cultures, raptors are also hunted and consumed as medicine or bushmeat (Zhang et al 2008; Buij et al 2013). With the challenges involved in captive breeding of many species, raptors observed in trade are often caught from the wild (MaMing et al., 2014, Nijman et al., 2009). This poses a threat to wild populations. A recent analysis of the global raptor trade from 1975 to 2015 revealed that though current legal commercial trade seems to not pose large conservation concern, there remains a lack of quantifiable evidence on the extent and impact of unregulated trade (Panter et al., 2018, Wyatt, 2011). Legal and illegal trade in live raptor species have been reported globally, for example, in Indonesia (Nijman et al., 2009, Eaton et al., 2016), Japan (Vall-llosera and Su 2018), and Russia (Wyatt, 2009, Wyatt, 2011). The noted increased raptor trade on social media platforms has also been flagged up (Iqbal, 2015, Iqbal, 2016, Gunawan et al., 2017, Nijman, 2020).",

One of the reasons for this increased popularity is that social media plays an integral role in Thailand\u2019s modern society, with over 50 million Facebook users, earning a rank of eighth globally among Facebook users (Leesa-nguansuk 2018). Enforcement agencies and Facebook has indeed cracked down on wildlife trade on social media platforms; however, in a cat\u2013mouse manner, traders consistently reopen groups or use maneuvers to evade from regulators and authorities, as a result, trade still exists.",

For market data, we conducted a literature review of previous surveys using two comparative approaches to analyze how species on offer may have changed over time. For recent online data, we report our findings on online trade in raptors over a two-year data monitoring period, collecting information on species on offer and asking prices. First, we made a comparison based on trade platform, that is, market (data from physical brick-and-mortar markets) and online (e-commerce and social media platforms) surveys. Second, we made a temporal comparison, using the \u201cInternet era\u201d as a defining marker: pre-Internet (before 1995) and post-Internet (after 1995). We defined the start of the Internetera as the year 1995 as in that year for the first time computers outsold TV sets (Newell 2001). We created models to explain the variability in the number and composition of the species in trade, using predictor variables such as body size (wingspan), clutch size, migratory status, and conservation status. Using data on asking prices from our two-year study, we explored the aforementioned variables to explain variation in price and to analyze temporal trends and seasonality. Based on our findings, we recommend increased monitoring and improved legal protection and enforcement for species.",

It is in the best interest of the sellers to ensure that as many potential customers have opportunity to see and buy whatever they have on offer. While a small proportion of wildlife trade occurs out of sight, in the \u201cback alleys of the Internet\u201d, or even on the dark web (Harrison et al 2016), this is very small and in the case of the global trade in raptors as pets or to be used in falconry is largely irrelevant. The online trade in raptors as pets occurs in the open. For instance, many of the Facebook groups where birds of prey are offered for sale are classified as \u201copen\u201d or \u201cpublic\u201d and have their privacy settings set at a level where it is very easy to observe or join a group. Once joined, posts and comments can be seen by all those that are part of that group, as well as everyone else who wishes to do so. The number of members that have joined groups is often in the 10,000s \u2013 in our study group member volume ranged from 7,763 to 31,557, with a mean of 18,042 members per group at the last period of monitoring. As such, one can have a reasonable expectation to be observed, perhaps even more so than when entering a public space such as a town square or an animal market. Indeed Burkell et al (2014) concluded \u201c\u2026the online social spaces are indeed loci of public display rather than private revelation: online profiles are structured with the view that \u201ceveryone\u201d can see them, even if the explicitly intended audience is more limited. These social norms are inconsistent with the claim that social media are private spaces; instead, it appears that participants view and treat online social networks as public venues.\u201d",

There are several approaches possible in conducting Facebook market surveys. For instance, Hinsley et al (2016) conducted a questionnaire survey to gain insight into the online orchid trade. The approach taken by Hinsley et al (2016) was to publicly state the status of \u201cresearcher\u201d and declare the intentions to collect data on orchid trade. Thereby, the researchers used the acknowledgment as a form of consent to access closed groups (Hinsley et al 2016). While other studies do not specify methods carried out for data collection but choose not to disclose specifics of forum name such as site name and address (Sung and Fong 2018). Machine learning techniques are also becoming incorporated to investigate illegal wildlife trade on social media using the three-step idea of mining, filtering, and identifying data. However, this approach is still in its early stages, and frameworks still need to be explored particularly related to data security and privacy requirements where researchers are based (Di Minin et al 2018).",

Bird markets in Indonesia are one of the places that have been thoroughly studied over time, from traditional markets (Nijman and Nekaris unpubl. data) to modern contemporary markets (Iqbal, 2016, Gunawan et al., 2017; Table 5). Iqbal (2016) monitored five specialized birds of prey Facebook groups for, on average, 8 months over 2015. Three of the five Facebook groups were based in Java (but of course people from outside this island are able to join and participate), and these were responsible for about two-thirds of the birds of prey that were offered for sale. Gunawan et al (2017) monitored 38 general wildlife trade and specialized birds of prey Facebook groups for 11 months over 2015, with about 90% of the offers originating from Facebook groups that were based in Java. Nijman and Nekaris (unpublished) monitored 15 bird markets in eight cities in Java from April 2014 to July 2019 (Nijman and Nekaris, 2017, Nijman et al., 2018) and recorded all birds of prey that were openly offered for sale. Despite differences in methodologies and survey efforts, we find similar links in species offered for sale, specially the migrant species which also fly over Thailand and mainland Southeast Asia such as the Japanese sparrowhawk Accipiter gularis and Chinese goshawk A. soloensis, as well as sales of nonmigratory species such as mountain hawk-eagles N. nipalensis which must have been imported from the mainland and Thailand are one of the closed source countries.",

A key reason is the increased desire for the closure of wet wildlife markets for a variety of reasons. There is evidence that physical markets are used as platforms to trade both legal and illegal wildlife (Fischer, 2004, Moyle, 2017). The drive for the sale of high-value derivative wildlife products such as ivory to close markets is a high profile example aimed to reduce the poaching of African elephants. Another example is the push for closures of physical wildlife markets because of them being potential source as a zoonotic disease hotspot (Karesh et al 2005). In 2002, the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in humans was linked to Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) in wet markets in Shenzen, China (Webster, 2004, Bell et al., 2004). In 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which causes respiratory illness, was linked to Huanan wet market in Wuhan, China (Yee et al 2020). This consequence of the outbreak to the domestic and global economy has led the Chinese government to impose a comprehensive ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals, with the exception of for medicinal purposes (Xinhua News 2020).",

The challenge to properly obtain data on what wildlife is being sold, the volumes and turnover rates and market dynamics are even harder to estimate when the trade goes underground. The important thing needed to identify a shift is thorough monitoring of both platforms to closely track it. Moreover, the same issues that follow physical markets of illegal items being laundered through legal trade platforms are still evident even among online market platforms (Gao and Clark 2014). However, law enforcement actions are not the same on both platforms. Traditional markets may require authorities going to shops that illegally sell such as city markets, border markets, trading hubs at ports, and stores. Online traders, on the other hand, are more flexible and traders do not necessarily need to have a pet shop. Conservative wildlife trade legislation in many places does not currently include the online trade. The potential threat remains that, if further bans of trade are extended onto online platforms, it may potentially even drive traders to go underground into the dark web and will pose further challenges for law enforcement agencies (Harrison et al 2016).",
