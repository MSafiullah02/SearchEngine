According to literature review, these diseases mentioned above are all sensitive to the variations of meteorological factors, especially for ambient temperature [2, 3]. Water-borne diseases are conditions caused by pathogenic microorganisms that are transmitted in water. The infection would occur when people ingested contaminated water or contacted with infected water containing various forms of intestinal pathogens during bathing or swimming. As a type of old diseases, the occurrence of schistosomiasis and its vector could also be impacted by ambient temperature [4]. At present, the epidemic of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is very serious in China, and it is believed that heat could facilitate the spread of HFMD [5]. Regarding respiratory infectious diseases, influenza is surely a representative infectious diseases sensitive to ambient temperature in China [6]. Therefore, to better understand the relationship between meteorological factors and infectious diseases in China, it is essential to carry out prediction and projection of important infectious diseases under the context of climate change which will be of great significance to the prevention and control of infectious diseases in future.",

In 2017, 5893 DF cases occurred in China with two of these dead. In recent years, indigenous cases of DF occurred in Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shanghai, Henan, and Shandong, while imported cases happened in all provinces except for Tianjin and Tibet in 2017. In China, the principal vectors for DF, including Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, are all sensitive to climate. Ae. albopictus is the most important mosquito in DF transmission in Guangdong and Zhejiang, while Ae. aegypti is the major DF vector in Yunnan.",

The ambient temperature could not only impact the reproductive of dengue virus in Aedes mosquitoes but also the distribution of Aedes mosquitoes. In China, regarding the impact of ambient temperature on dengue vector distribution, Wu et al. found that Ae. albopictus have expanded their geographic range to areas with an annual mean temperature below 11 \u00b0C and a January mean temperature below \u22125 \u00b0C using CLIMEX model [8]. Temperature plays an important role in vector competence. Liu et al. found that temperature increase enhances the competence of Ae. albopictus to transmit dengue virus [9]. Most studies in China believed that temperature can drive dengue transmission [10, 11], showing a nonlinear effect [11, 12]. Among those studies, different models are employed such as generalized additive model (GAM), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model, ecologically based model, etc. In recent years, most studies were carried out in Guangdong and Yunnan provinces considering the higher frequency of DF outbreak. Local DF cases were positively associated with temperature with different time lags in Guangzhou [13]. The minimum temperature at a lag of 1 month was positively associated with dengue incidence in Guangzhou [14]. The mean and minimum temperatures were positively associated with increased DF risk, while the maximum temperature was negatively associated with DF transmission [15]. Xiang et al. demonstrated that a reversed U-shaped nonlinear association was found between ambient temperature and DF in Guangzhou. The optimal maximum temperature (Tmax) range for dengue transmission was 21.6\u201332.9 \u00b0C and 11.2\u201323.7 \u00b0C for minimum temperature (Tmin) [16].",

Extreme high temperature restricts the development of mosquitoes and reduces the transmission of malaria since higher temperature increases mosquito growth, virus replication, and biting frequency of vectors. Generally speaking, temperatures lower than 16 \u00b0C or higher than 30 \u00b0C are not conductive to mosquitoes development [19]. Daily variations on temperature could impact necessary mosquito and parasite characteristics that help to malaria transmission intensity [20]. In Jinan, maximum temperature with a 1 \u00b0C rise may be relevant to a 7.7\u201312.7% increase in malaria cases, while minimum temperature with a 1 \u00b0C rise might lead to about 11.8\u201312.7% increase in malaria cases [21]. Li et al. reported that each 1 \u00b0C rise in temperature amounts to an increase of 0.90% in the monthly malaria cases in Guangzhou [3]. However, the correlation between temperature indexes and incidence of malaria may not be throughout the year. Tian et al. found an increased risk of transmission due to a high temperature in warmer winters [22]. The effect of ambient temperature concerning malaria frequently leads to a lag-time effect because of the life cycle of Anopheles and the parasite [23]. Zhou et al. revealed that a 75.3% variation on monthly malaria incidence was related to the average temperature in last 2 months in central China [18]. In four counties of Yunnan, an increasing temperature resulted in increased malaria risk the varied lag periods for these associations [24].",

Suitable climate could increase the reproductive rate of pathogenic microbes [30] and contribute to form stable plague foci [31]. Rodent populations and flea survival respond rapidly to climate variations [30]. Epizootics are likely to occur when rodent and flea number excess a certain threshold [32\u201334]. The high abundance of rodents and fleas would also increase the human plague risk [35]. Temperature seems to determine the distribution of Yersinia pestis. Nearly 95% of human plague occur in regions with an average annual temperature greater than 13 \u00b0C, and most large plague outbreaks occur within areas with an annual temperature of 24\u201327 \u00b0C [36]. Additionally, outbreaks of historical plague pandemics also seemed to be driven by climate change. The introduction of the Black Death is associated with climate fluctuations in Central Asia, with an approximate delay of 15 years [37]. The above-normal warmer and wetter climate during 1855 and 1870 may be responsible for extensive plague outbreaks in China during the Third Pandemic [36]. The associations between climate and plague can vary by regions [38, 39].",

            "text": "Regarding the comparative studies, most studies have focused on the individual effect of precipitation or temperature, or the mixed effect of two climate variables. As for the high temperature, plague would increase under this condition in western United States [38, 40]. In Arizona and New Mexico, plague would increase if the number of days above a certain temperature threshold increased, with 80 \u00b0F for New Mexico and 85 \u00b0F for Arizona, respectively [38]. However, the transmission between fleas and mammalian hosts was significantly reduced when temperature excess 27.5 \u00b0C [41]. The mixed effect of precipitation and temperature also revealed a regional difference. Yersinia pestis prevalence was shown to increase with warmer springs and wetter summers in gerbils in Kazakhstan [42]. Similarly, the rodent and flea densities, as well as the presence of plague in Mongolian gerbils, are positively correlated with the precipitation and temperature in China [43]. High risk of human plague tends to follow the plague outbreaks in hosts [33]. However, an increased plague incidence can be expected in Vietnam during the hot, dry seasons [41]. Besides, plague outbreaks in preindustrial period were more frequent in cold and arid climate in Europe [44]. Plague is also associated with large-scale weather events [28]. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are related to precipitation and temperature which could in turn affect plague dynamics [45, 46]. The increasing rate of human plague was closely associated with Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Sea Surface Temperature of east Pacific equator (SST) in China. Ari et al. found PDO explained much of the human plague variation in western United States. However, as the association between large-scale climate and plague was nonstationary and nonlinear in Madagascar and Europe [45, 47], we should pay more attention to the scale of the climate and the complexity of the interaction in the ecosystem when analyzing large-scale climate and plague systems.",

It is generally thought that ambient temperature is one of the most key meteorological factors exerting the impact of endemic intensity of HFRS [48], because warm temperature is in ideal condition for the growth of crops and increase of rodent. Furthermore, it is probably that surface air temperature can increase more obviously in winter and spring than in other seasons, particularly in the northern China [49]. As the temperature increases, areas with relatively lower temperature could become beneficial to rodent breeding then extend the breeding seasons, which have a potential impact on the number, scale, and emergence of new natural foci of HFRS. In China, most studies showed that HFRS is sensitive to ambient temperature. Temperatures from 10 to 25 \u00b0C are most beneficial to rodent growth, and breeding rates for both A. agrarius and R. norvegicus would decrease when temperatures were out of this range [48]. Temperature of 17 \u00b0C as a threshold was identified in a study, below which there was a positive association, while above the threshold there was an inverse association [50]. Likewise, it is reported that the highest incidence of HFRS is with temperatures about 17.5 \u00b0C [51]. Temperature above 23.7 \u00b0C and below 6 \u00b0C revealed positive effects on the HFRS incidence of 3 months later; in contrast, temperature between 6.0 \u00b0C to 23.7 \u00b0C was negative with the incidence of HFRS [52].",

            "text": "Ambient temperature is an important ecological factor for growth and development of S. japonicum and the presence of O. hupensis, which can influence the prevalence and distribution of schistosomiasis in China [74\u201379]. In the process of transmission of schistosomiasis, ambient temperature plays a vital role in the biological activity of O. hupensis and the development of S. japonicum within the intermediate host. The optimal temperature range for miracidia infecting O. hupensis is between 10 \u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C. There is no significance in infection rates when temperature ranges between 21 \u00b0C and 31 \u00b0C and low infection rates under 10 \u00b0C. However, miracidia can never infect O. hupensis when temperature drops to 3.2 \u00b0C [4, 80]. After the invasion, S. japonicum arrested their development in snails when temperature was kept at about 15.3 \u00b0C or above 37 \u00b0C, while the optimum development occurred at 25 \u00b0C\u201330 \u00b0C, which means within a temperature range of 15.3 \u00b0C\u201330 \u00b0C, the higher the temperature is, the shorter the pre-patent period of S. japonicum within O. hupensis will be [79, 81]. Temperature could also influence the cercaria effusion, where 25 \u00b0C\u201330 \u00b0C were the optimal range [82]. The optimal temperature for O. hupensis ranges between 20 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C, which means any temperature out of this range would result in delayed or arrested development and reproduction of O. hupensis [74, 83, 84]. Physiological functions of O. hupensis declines as environmental temperature drops [74]. When the temperature drops to 5.8 \u00b0C\u20136.4 \u00b0C, half of the snails were in hibernation (ET50) [79, 81]. In Yunnan, it is concluded that the optimal LST for O. hupensis was \u226522.7 \u00b0C after considering land surface temperature (LST) as the most suitable environmental factor for snail habitat prediction [85]. In Dongting Lake Region, the mean snail density increased gradually when the temperature was between 24.30 and 25.70 \u00b0C, while mean snail density decreased gradually when the temperature was from 24.15 to 22.40 \u00b0C in the GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) model. A possible suitable range of temperature was from 22.73 to 24.23 \u00b0C estimated by inter-quartile range in high-high clustered areas. [86]. The accumulated degree-days (ADD) are considered to be similar to growing degree-days (GDD), which both reflects the heat accumulation during the development of the organism. It was estimated that the mean ADD for the development of S. japonicum in its intermediate host snail was 842.9\u2013852.6 degree-days, and the same index for the development of a generation of O. hupensis was 3846.3 degree-days [79, 87]. Several studies conducted in Yunnan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan have drawn the similar conclusion that the mean LST, the median night-time LST, the maximum LST at daytime, the maximum and minimum LST at night, and average temperature in June were positively associated with the prevalence of S. japonicum, which showed the importance of LST [5, 88\u201393]. From another perspective, a spatio-temporal kriging model suggested seasonal variation of LST at daytime were negatively associated with the risk of schistosomiasis [94], for the possible reason that large seasonal temperature differences would impede the development of S. japonicum [79]. The January temperature is a significant determinant to the distribution of schistosomiasis. When the January mean minimum temperature is below \u22124 \u00b0C or the annual extreme low temperature drops under \u22127.6 \u00b0C, it is not suitable for O. hupensis to survive, which is the main reason that restricts transmission of S. japonicum shifting toward to north [79, 95]. However, the northern limit of the schistosome- endemic zone has shifted due to climate change. Yang et al. [96] found that the distribution limits of O. hupensis have shifted from 33\u00b015\u2019N to 33\u00b041\u2019N due to an increase of 0.96 \u00b0C of January temperature in the past 30 years. In other words, the potential transmission area have expanded by more than 40,000 km2, which resulted in an additional 20.7 million people at risk of schistosomiasis [90]. The average minimum temperature in January and in winter had predominant influence on Oncomelania density and frame occurrence rate of living Oncomelania, respectively. The variation of average minimum temperature in January by 1 \u00b0C would lead to the change of Oncomelania density by 5.08\u20136.71%. The variation of average minimum temperature in winter by 1 \u00b0C would lead to the change of frame occurrence rate by 15.521\u201315.928% [97]. What\u2019s more, O. hupensis can only exist in areas with an annual mean temperature of 16\u201320 \u00b0C [98]. Yang et al. found that the lowest air temperature in a year was one of the factors that significantly affect the occurrence of snails in Hunan, China. When the lowest air temperature in a year ranges from \u22122.88 to \u22122.10 \u00b0C, the snails could exist, while no snail can survive when the range was between \u22122.88 and \u2212 2.34 \u00b0C [99]. A predictive model based on distribution of schistosomiasis in eastern China has been constructed to estimate the probability that schistosomiasis occurs in a target area, which showed a mean temperature of coldest quarter was of significance in model [100]. However, air temperature is less suitable for predicting snail density compared to soil temperature [101].",

Though large number of studies that involving different temperature-related variables have been conducted, the question that which one is the most closely related to the schistosomiasis is still unknown. In addition, widespread use of GIS/RS promotes the multiscale studies in China, but there is not many studies carried out on national level yet where the trend of temperature variation is more stable.

In Zhengzhou, average atmospheric temperature with 2 or 3 weeks lagged were identified as significant predictors for the number of HFMD and the pathogens [106]. Using meta-analysis, Cheng et al. analyzed the relationship between ambient temperature and HFMD in East and Southeast Asia and found that ambient temperature could increase the incidence of HFMD in Asia-Pacific regions. It was revealed that 1 \u00b0C increase in the temperature was significantly correlated to the increasing of the incidence of HFMD [107].

In Changsha, the sensitive climatic factors did have a \u201cdriving effect\u201d on the incidence of influenza A (H1N1).

In Shanghai, H7N9 incidence rate was significantly associated with fortnightly mean temperature (relative risk (RR), 1.54; 95% credible interval (CI), 1.22\u20131.94) [119]. Mean monthly temperature was significantly associated with the occurrence of human H7N9 infection [120]. Zhang et al. found that both daily minimum and daily maximum temperature contributed significantly to human infection with the influenza A H7N9 virus [121]. Models incorporating the nonlinear effect of minimum or maximum temperature on day 13 prior to disease onset were considered to have the best predictive effect. Liu et al. investigate the independent and interactive effects of ambient temperature (TM) and absolute humidity (AH) on H7N9 risks in China. Significantly nonlinear negative associations of TM and VP with H7N9 risks were observed in all cases, and in cases from northern and southern regions. Different risky windows of H7N9 infection exist in the northern (TM, 0\u201318 \u00b0C; VP, 313 mb) and southern areas (TM, 7\u201321 \u00b0C; VP, 3\u201317 mb) [122]. Temperature was correlated to the avian influenza virus (AIV) invasion in the destination to some degree [123]. Since the end of 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) H5N1 have caused lots of outbreaks in poultries and wild birds from East Asia and have spread to at least 48 countries. Liu et al. developed a new climatic approach for early predicting future HPAI outbreaks and preventing pandemic disasters. The results demonstrate a temperature drop shortly before these outbreaks in birds in each of the Eurasian regions stricken in 2005 and 2006. Dust storms, like those that struck near China\u2019s Lake Qinghai around May 4, 2005, exacerbated the spread of HPAI H5N1 virus, causing the deaths of a record number of wild birds and triggering the subsequent spread of H5N1 [124]. Climate factors were the strongest predictors of influenza B seasonality, including minimum temperature [125]. In comparison with the incidence of influenza to climatic factors during 2000\u20132007 in five countries, Tang et al. found that the mean temperature was the key climate variable associated with the incidence of influenza B in Hong Kong, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Vancouver [126]. Furthermore, Internet search metrics in conjunction with temperature [127] could be adopted to predict influenza outbreaks, which can be regarded as a prerequisite for establishing early-warning systems using search and temperature data.",

Correlation analysis and back propagation artificial neural work were applied; the annual JE incidence was considered to be positively correlated with maximum temperature and extreme maximum temperature [131]. In areas close to the three gorges dam, a significant positive association between temperature with a lag of 1 and 3 months and JE incidence was found [132]. Few studies believed that temperature has a threshold effect on JE cases. In 2007, Bi et al. have clarified positive relationships between monthly maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and JE transmission in a rural region of Anhui and a metropolitan area of Shandong with no rice plating and the uncertain role of pigs in JE transmission [133]. In Jinan, an obvious increase in JE cases occurred when the monthly mean maximum temperature was higher than 25.2 \u00b0C or the minimum temperature was over 21.0 \u00b0C [133].

Results indicated increased suitability and range expansion in O. hupensis in the future. The southern Central Route of SNWDP will coincide with suitable areas for O. hupensis in 2050\u20132060. Its suitable areas will also expand northward along the southern Eastern Route in 2080\u20132090 [142]. Modeling with application of GIS and RS that integrated ambient temperature (i.e., LST) resulted in a good predictive accuracy for the presence of O. hupensis in recent years [143]. Zhou et al. applied the mean monthly temperature and other environment variables in GIS model to predict the transmission of schistosomiasis in the southern part of China. S. japonicum-endemic areas were restricted to settings with a transmission risk index exceeding 900, which is mostly consistent with the \u22124 \u00b0C average minimum temperature isotherm in China, while an improved model conducted by Zhao et al. supposed isotherm was at \u22122 \u00b0C [144\u2013146]. After that, an improved GIS forecast model combined with mean minimum temperature in January revealed hotspots of high transmission intensities in Jiangsu and adjacent areas in different transmission seasons, which showed a high sensitivity of 88.9% [146].",

The biology-based model is used to calculate the corresponding risk areas and potential transmission index in China in response to different climate scenarios. The transmission areas of schistosomiasis are supposed to extend to north both in 2050s and 2070s under A2 and B2 scenario, especially in Jiangsu and Anhui, and the extended areas in 2070s are larger than that in 2050s. North boundary of the transmission areas will extend further north under A2 than that under B2 in 2070s, which has reached Shandong. Compared with the year of 2005, the high-risk areas with potential transmission index>1500 increased by 89.6% and 81.3% under A2 and B2 in 2050s, respectively, which further increased in the 2070s [147].",

There was not significant variation of the average incidence of HFMD from 2030s to 2080s under RCP 2.6 scenario. The incidence of the disease was also increased under RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 scenarios. However, the average incidence of HFMD would increase linearly under RCP 8.5 scenario with the fastest growth rate (unpublished). Regarding the trend of HFMD in various major administrative regions under different climate scenarios, the incidence of HFMD in the northeast and northwest regions declined continuously in the future, while the increase of the incidence of the southwest region was under RCP 2.6 scenario. Under the scenario of RCP4.5, the incidence of HFMD in North China, East China, Central China, southern China, and southwest increased continuously. In the context of RCP6.0, the incidence of the disease in north China, East China, Central China, and southern China increased continuously. And in the context of RCP 8.5, the incidence of the disease in other regions, except in the northeast, increased. According to the trend of HFMD in various climate zone under different climate scenarios, the trend of the incidence of HFMD is increased in the Qinghai Tibet plateau and the middle subtropical region while that decreased in the middle temperate zone under the scenario of RCP 2.6. Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the incidence of HFMD in the warm temperate zone, the northern subtropical zone, the middle subtropical, and the south subtropical regions is increased continuously while that decreased in the moderate temperate zone and the cold temperate zone; and the incidence of HFMD in warm temperate, northern subtropical, south subtropical, and marginal tropics is increased continuously while that decreased in middle temperate zone and cold temperate zone under RCP 6.0 scenario; and the incidence of HFMD in other regions increased except that in the middle temperate zone and cold temperate zone under RCP 8.5 scenario.",

The results show that Japan and southern China will become high-risk areas of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza in January and February. Northern Africa, Western Asia, and Central Asia entered a high-risk period from April to June. The west coast of Africa, West Asia, India, and southern China become areas high risk of outbreak after October.
