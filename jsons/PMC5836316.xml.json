            "text": "RNAi evolved in plants and invertebrates as an antiviral mechanism, combating viral infections through degradation of viral RNA into siRNAs that bind viral nucleic acids and thus inhibit viral replication [1]. In vertebrates RNAi functions as an antiviral mechanism in non-differentiated embryonic stem cells only 2, 3. In differentiated vertebrate somatic cells, type I interferon (IFN) (see Glossary) and the antiviral effectors IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) have evolved to mediate the majority of cellular antiviral responses [4]. The vertebrate RNAi system regulates the function of cellular mRNA through tissue- and cell-specific expression of host-cell-encoded miRNAs that bind mRNAs and alter their translation or abundance [5]. To date >5500 miRNAs have been predicted throughout the human genome [6] with many limited to specific tissues [5]. Invertebrates also use miRNAs to regulate mRNA translation and control protein abundance (reviewed in [7]). Recent evidence indicates that host miRNAs also bind to RNA virus genomes, regulating their translation and replication and altering viral pathogenesis. RNA virus infection can mediate changes in the expression of cellular miRNAs leading to downstream changes in the host transcriptome that can be advantageous to the virus. However, changes in miRNA expression can also lead to increases in antiviral effector activities resulting in decreased viral replication. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of RNA viruses and how they have evolved to use host miRNAs to evade antiviral immune responses, leading to enhanced viral replication and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs located primarily within the introns of both coding and noncoding host RNAs (Box 1\n). miRNAs bind to miRNA-binding sites within mRNAs and viral genomes to mediate miRNA function 8, 9. Naturally occurring miRNA-binding sites within viral genomes are generally located in the 5\u2032 [10] and 3\u2032 non-translated regions (NTRs)\n[11] but have recently been found in the coding regions of viral proteins 12, 13. Increasing the number of miRNA-binding sites in a viral 3\u2032 NTR with perfect complementarity to the target miRNA has led to increased translational repression\nin vitro and greater attenuation in mice [14]. In similar studies, cooperativity between two or more miRNA-binding sites enhanced repression of mRNA translation via an unknown mechanism when sites were separated by 13\u201335 nucleotides [15]. Therefore, the location and number of miRNA-binding sites within a viral genome can influence miRNA function. Naturally occurring viral miRNA-binding sites within viral RNAs may not be uniformly distributed or have perfect complementary to the miRNA. Further experimental validation will be required to determine whether cooperativity between viral miRNA-binding sites leads to enhanced transcriptional repression. Furthermore, empirical studies are needed for all miRNA\u2013viral interactions identified in silico \u2013 as computational methods might not fully recapitulate the cellular environment \u2013 to identify interactions that are not functional due to higher-order target RNA structures or other nucleic acid interactions.Box 1Biochemistry of miRNA\u2013RNA Virus InteractionsmiRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II into primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts containing a stem\u2013loop structure encompassing the miRNA of interest [82]. Within the cell nucleus, pri-miRNA is digested enzymatically by the Drosha protein into pre-miRNA containing a hairpin structure, which is exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (Figure 1) [83]. Subsequently, the Dicer protein cleaves the terminal loop structure of the hairpin leaving a small, 21\u201323-nucleotide miRNA duplex. The argonaute protein then associates with one strand of the miRNA duplex to form the RISC, mediating translational repression or mRNA destabilization 84, 85. Each strand in the miRNA duplex can function as an miRNA and be loaded into the RISC; however, the strand that is more thermodynamically unstable at the 5\u2032 end is incorporated preferentially [86]. For a more detailed review of miRNA processing, see [82].A seed sequence located at nucleotide positions 2\u20138 of the 5\u2032 end of the miRNA binds complementary sequences within the 3\u2032 NTR of either a host mRNA or the genome of an invading RNA virus [87]. A single miRNA can possess binding specificity for many different target mRNAs based on the cell type and the pattern of mRNA expression [88]. A perfect match between the miRNA and the entire mRNA target sequences leads to RNA cleavage, albeit rarely in mammals [87]. More commonly, an exact seed sequence match, \u2013 a canonical miRNA-binding site without complete complementarity in the remainder of the target mRNA \u2013 results in translation inhibition and, eventually, RNA destabilization and degradation 84, 85. Recently, noncanonical binding sites have also been described that have imperfect seed sequence complementarity. As an example, noncanonical miRNA-binding sites are thought to comprise up to 40% of the total miR-155 miRNA-binding sites in host mRNAs [89]. However, although noncanonical binding sites may mediate miRNA binding to the mRNA, these sites may not fully suppress mRNA translation [90]. If miRNAs can functionally inhibit RNA viruses through noncanonical interactions, the number of potential miRNA\u2013RNA virus interactions would dramatically increase. Mutational analysis of known miRNA-binding sites into noncanonical target sequences will be required to determine whether such noncanonical interactions can mediate productive miRNA\u2013RNA virus interactions.",

            "text": "Transcriptional, epigenetic, and environmental conditions drive miRNA gene transcription leading to temporal and cell-specific miRNA expression [16]. Common laboratory practices can also alter the miRNA environment within a cell. For example, culturing cells can reduce miRNA levels compared with primary tissues [17] and cells at a higher confluency can exhibit increased miRNA levels compared with less confluent cells due to increased cell\u2013cell contact [18]. Compared with cells isolated from primary tissues, it is commonly known that cancer cell lines have different expression patterns of miRNAs that can contribute to carcinogenesis [19]. C6/36 cells derived from Aedes albopictus mosquitoes do not efficiently cleave viral RNA into siRNAs for use in the antiviral RNAi pathway but can still process miRNAs [20]. By contrast, Aag2 cells derived from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have a functional double-stranded RNA processing pathway and can generate both siRNAs and miRNAs [21]. Furthermore, studies that globally inhibit the RNAi pathway in single cell types [22] are likely to fail in detecting cell/tissue-specific miRNA\u2013viral interactions and can underestimate the impact of cell-specific miRNA\u2013viral interactions occurring in infected hosts. Finally, in vitro models may not fully characterize how miRNA\u2013viral interactions alter global cellular miRNA levels [23], which could possibly lead to important changes in paracrine or autocrine signaling in intact hosts [11]. Knowledge of the pathobiological features of a viral infection within a specific host (e.g., unexplained restriction in particular tissues) and using disease-relevant cell lines that express an miRNA of interest might also lead to the identification of cell-specific miRNAs that contribute to viral pathogenesis.",

EEEV, an alphavirus, causes the most acutely virulent mosquito-borne viral disease in the USA, with a >30% mortality rate in humans and long-term neurological sequelae in surviving individuals [26]. In humans EEEV infection is characterized by a limited disease prodrome before the manifestation of encephalitis due to the inability of EEEV to replicate in hematopoietic cells and to elicit a strong innate immune response 11, 27. EEEV is a positive-sense RNA virus that encodes three canonical and one noncanonical miRNA-binding sites in the 3\u2032 NTR that are specific for the hematopoietic cell-specific miRNA miR-142-3p [11]. miR-142-3p expression has been shown to prevent translation of the incoming EEEV genome and prevent virus replication in both human and murine macrophages as well as dendritic cells [11]. This inhibition of myeloid cell replication prevented IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction in vivo, directly contributing to the extreme virulence of EEEV that is seen in mice, and presumably in humans [11]. Mutation of the miR-142-3p-binding sites in the EEEV genome has been shown to allow virus translation and replication in both human and murine myeloid cells, which was shown to lead to systemic IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production and virus attenuation in mice. Presumably, strong selective pressure has maintained these miR-142-3p-binding sites, since 17 of 23 North American EEEV strains isolated from nature have the same sequence and location of miR-142-3p binding sites within the 3\u2032 NTR [11].",

Retroviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with two different points in the virus life cycle where miRNAs can bind to virus RNA: the genomic RNA and the RNA transcribed from integrated DNA. For example, primate foamy retrovirus type 1 (PFV-1) encodes a binding site for miR-32 in the 3\u2032 NTR of multiple protein transcripts that can inhibit PFV-1 replication. To evade miR-32 repression, PFV-1 encodes a transactivator protein, Tas, that nonspecifically suppresses the miRNA processing pathway and potentially inhibits the production of miRNAs that might limit virus replication, including miR-32 in infected mammalian cells [28]. Human T cell leukemia virus, type I (HTLV-1) translation is inhibited in resting human T cells by miR-28-3p. A single nucleotide variant in the miR-28-3p target sequence of the Japanese ATK-1 strain has been shown to confer miR-28-3p translational repression resistance, increasing virus replication as well as transmission between individuals, occurrences not normally seen with other HTLV-1 strains [29]. miRNA can also contribute to retroviral latency within T cells by preventing translation of the virus RNA and suppressing virus replication. For example, during HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells in vitro, expression of miR-28-5p, miR-150, miR-223, and miR-382 has been found to mediate translational repression of HIV-1 RNA [30]. Another miRNA, miR-29a, functions through a different mechanism to restrict viral replication during HIV-1 infection by binding to the 3\u2032 NTR leading to its increased association with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and P bodies and thus preventing virus translation [31].",

Natural variants of EV71 bear mutations in the miR-296-5p-binding sites rendering this virus insensitive to miR-296-5p restriction [13].

Treatment with a miR-181 mimic limits PRRSV replication in vivo leading to extended infected-pig survival times, thus demonstrating the therapeutic potential of this miRNA during an RNA virus infection [39]. While these studies suggest widespread negative regulation of RNA virus replication by host cell miRNAs, the capacity for RNA viruses to mutate rapidly to eliminate miRNA binding 9, 41, 42 indicates that direct antiviral activities of miRNAs may be limited to particular cells or to a subset of viral quasispecies present at any given time within the host.

The most studied interaction of this type was first identified in 2005 and occurs between liver-specific miR-122 and HCV. Rather than binding to the 3\u2032NTR, miR-122 bound to the 5\u2032 NTR of HCV [10] preventing 5\u2032 host exonuclease activity and RNA degradation in the infected human hepatocarcinoma-derived cell line Huh-7 [24]. Moreover, removal of miR-122 from Huh-7 cells could reduce HCV replication [10]. Thus, miR-122 is currently an active target for antiviral therapeutics in the treatment of chronic HCV infection 10, 43. Recently, miRNAs were also found to increase RNA stability through interactions with the 3\u2032 NTR; miR-17 and let-7c both bound to the 3\u2032 NTR of the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) genome increasing virus translation and RNA stability rather than causing translational repression [23]. Interestingly, let-7 sites are present within several RNA viruses, including alphaviruses [23]. The ability of two diverse members of the Flaviviridae family, HCV and BVDV, to utilize host miRNAs to help stabilize virus RNA through two different sites within the virus genome suggests that this interaction might have evolved independently. It will be interesting to determine whether other virus families use miRNAs in a similar manner to help stabilize viral RNA.",

            "text": "In addition to tissue-specific changes in miRNA expression during viral infections (Box 3\n), other important changes in miRNA-mediated protein expression can occur. For instance, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is a key cytokine induced by viral infection that leads to the downstream upregulation of antiviral ISGs. Viruses have evolved multiple mechanisms to evade the IFN system to establish a productive infection. Typically, during an infection viral proteins inhibit either pattern-recognition receptor recognition or downstream signaling cascades to prevent ISG induction [49]. However, a role for virus-mediated regulation of the IFN signaling cascade through changes in host miRNA levels has recently been proposed. For example, EV71 [50], dengue virus (DENV) [51], and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [52] induction of miR-146a in infected cells has been shown to negatively regulate the IFN signaling protein tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 6 (TRAF6), thus preventing the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. In addition, downregulation of miR-432 by JEV infection has been reported to increase expression of the negative regulator of cytokine signaling suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5) in infected human microglial cells, thereby dampening the antiviral response [53]. Induction of miR-29c, miR-451, and miR-485 in influenza-infected cells has also been found to limit cytokine and chemokine responses through inhibition of various antiviral proteins (Table 2) and to prevent overactive IFN and inflammatory responses 34, 54, 55. HCV infection can upregulate miR-758 [56], miR-130a [57], and miR-373 [58], inhibiting various components of IFN signaling to decrease IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production (Table 2). Another example is avian leukosis virus subgroup J infection, which in chicken spleen was shown to lead to miR-23b expression and downregulation of both IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) levels and innate immune induction [59]. It is likely that future work will identify more miRNAs that are involved in downregulating the innate immune response during RNA virus infections.Box 3Tissue-Specific Changes in miRNA Expression during Viral InfectionTissue-specific changes in miRNA expression can also contribute to virus-induced pathology in mice. For instance, JEV and WNV infection of the central nervous system 99, 100, 101, 102 and influenza virus infection of the lung 103, 104 can lead to changes in multiple miRNAs implicated in the regulation of proinflammatory responses. Upregulation of miR-19b and miR-1 by Coxsackie B3 virus infection was found to downregulate the expression of gap junction proteins \u2013 required for cell-to-cell contact \u2013 in human and mouse cardiomyocytes, leading to the development of viral myocarditis 105, 106. Another study documented that induction of miR-146a and downregulation of miR-370 following EV71 infection and miR-6124 expression after WNV infection led to increased cellular apoptosis and cell death through the regulation of apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins 107, 108. Obviously, changes in miRNA levels associated with viral infection can contribute to pathological and/or protective responses. However, as with antiviral activities, the role of these effects in the replication and disease process should be considered carefully with respect to the effects on single cells or tissues and the overall pathogenesis of the virus in a given host, as well as host\u2013host transmission mechanisms.",

For example, while miR-130a can downregulate IFN-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) protein levels after HCV infection to increase virus replication [57], miR-130a induction can also lead to antiviral ISG expression, increased IFN production, and reduced virus replication in Huh-7.5.1 hepatocarcinoma cells [60]. These results demonstrate that the same miRNA can have pleiotropic effects during virus infection, which may be due to two different mechanisms: direct targeting of a cellular protein (IFITM1) [57] or targeting of an unknown master regulator that controls the expression of many ISGs [60]. Interestingly, upregulation of miR-130a following HCV infection can also downregulate the expression of miR-122, providing a second mechanism to limit HCV replication [60]. Following DENV infection of a human monocyte cell line, miR-30e* induction has been shown to suppress virus replication by downregulating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA or I\u03baB\u03b1) leading to continual NF-\u03baB activation and upregulation of ISGs and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production [61]. Finally, rather than modulating ISG levels, miR-532-5p upregulation during West Nile virus (WNV) infection has been shown to lead to downregulation of SEC14 and of spectrin domain-containing 1 (SESTD1) and TGF-beta-activated kinase 1/MAP3K7-binding protein 3 (TAB3), two proteins required for virus replication in infected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells [62].",

For example, the borna disease virus phosphoprotein was shown to inhibit the expression of a known regulator of innate immune responses, miR-155, limiting the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 during infection in human oligodendroglioma cells [63]. Also, the coronavirus OC43 nucleocapsid protein has been found to bind the NF-\u03baB negative regulator miR-9 in HEK293T cells, allowing continual NF-\u03baB translation; however, the role of this activity during coronavirus infection remains unclear [64]. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) NS1 and NS2 proteins can antagonize let-7i and miR-30b induction through the inhibition of innate immune signaling proteins in human bronchial epithelial cells [65]. EV71 3C protein can block the upregulation of miR-526a by degrading IRF7 and preventing enhancement of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling [66]. Finally, virus protein expression can also lead to the upregulation of miRNAs, as in the case of the RSV G protein, which can increase let-7f expression, negatively regulating IFN production and delaying virus clearance in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells [67]. Potentially, viral protein-mediated changes in miRNA expression may occur through an indirect mechanism governed by viral inhibition of the innate immune response rather than a direct interaction between the viral protein and the transcription factors that regulate miRNA expression, but further experiments would be required to elucidate this point.",

            "text": "As described above, miRNA sequestration and/or alteration of expression levels by RNA viruses can lead to cellular transcriptome changes that promote favorable conditions for viral replication. For example, influenza virus infection has been shown to downregulate miR-24 in A549 cells leading to increased furin protease levels and, thus, increased cleavage of the influenza hemagglutinin protein, leading to increased numbers of infectious influenza particles [68]. Also in A549 cells, influenza virus downregulation of miR-548an was shown to lead to increased NS1-binding protein levels and increased RNA stability by decreasing cellular apoptosis [69]. In another study EV71 infection increased miR-141 levels in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, leading to the downregulation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E protein and thus contributing to the switch from cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs to cap-independent translation of virus RNAs [70]. Furthermore, miR-146a-5p upregulation after HCV infection of human hepatocytes and in liver tissues from HCV-infected patients has been shown to promote the assembly of virus particles and egress from an infected cell, increasing HCV infection, through an unknown mechanism [71]. In another example RSV infection of human bronchial epithelial cells resulted in the downregulation of miR-221 levels, preventing infected cell apoptosis and leading to increased virus replication [72]. Finally, transfection of miRNAs into cells before virus infection has led to the identification of novel proteins involved in virus replication, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (C1/C2) (hnRNP C) and leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) in poliovirus [73] and influenza infections, respectively [74]. The use of miRNA expression screens to identify novel cellular proteins involved in RNA virus replication will be more common in the future. However, confirmation of the role of these miRNAs in vivo will be needed to determine their specific functional contribution to viral replication and pathogenesis.",

Therefore, positive selection, or at least the absence of negative selection, is likely to be required to maintain the miRNA-binding sites within the virus genome. For example, EEEV replication in a non-miR-142-3p-expressing mammalian cell line resulted in a 238-nucleotide deletion in the 3\u2032 NTR encompassing all of the miR-142-3p-binding sites [41]. Similarly, artificially inserted miRNA-binding sites in the 3\u2032 NTR of DENV [42] and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) [14] were deleted in vivo during infection in mice. These results demonstrate that miRNA-binding sites in the 3\u2032 NTR without a positive influence on virus replication can be rapidly deleted in vivo. Therefore, it is unclear how sites that negatively impact replication might be retained in virus populations. With EEEV, replication in the mosquito vector appears to provide positive selection for retention of miR-142-3p-binding sites, as deletion of the sites decreased virus replication in mosquito cell cultures and greatly suppressed acquisition by mosquito vectors [11]. By contrast, site removal has no impact on replication in mammalian cells that do not express the miRNA. Mosquitoes do not express miR-142-3p [76], suggesting that another, unknown mechanism underlies the requirement for these sites for efficient replication.",

One potential selective pressure to maintain miRNA-binding sites may result from tempering of viral replication in certain cells or tissues that enables efficient virus dissemination without severe detrimental effects to the host.

Future work (see Outstanding Questions and Box 4\n) will help to define the role of miRNAs during these processes. However, knowledge regarding the role of miRNAs has already been applied to the development of antiviral therapeutics [43] and gene therapy vectors (reviewed in [77]). An miRNA therapeutic for Ebola virus was used during the recent outbreak in Africa; however, testing was ultimately suspended as the drug did not demonstrate a significant role in patient recovery [78]. Also, insertion of tissue-specific miRNA-binding sites has been used as an effective mechanism to prevent virus replication in particular tissues as an attenuation mechanism for vaccines, helping to limit adverse events [79]. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests the presence of virus-derived small RNAs during infection of both mammalian and arthropod cells 80, 81. While controversial, their presence and function during animal infections will need to be further examined. Viral interactions with the miRNA system can affect cellular miRNA and transcriptome levels as well as viral replication within a cell expressing a specific miRNA; these may indirectly modulate cytokine expression and tissue responses throughout an infected host. Consequently, future approaches tackling these questions are likely to emerge from this exciting area of investigation.Outstanding QuestionsFor arthropod-borne viruses, what role do miRNAs play in determining host, reservoir, or vector range during the viral transmission cycle?Is location within the genome or the number of miRNA-binding sites the key factor determining translational repression and, consequently, the suppression of viral replication?Do viral noncanonical miRNA-binding sites mediate miRNA binding and translational repression?How does viral infection mediate changes in miRNA levels within the cell and does this affect cellular gene regulation?Can knowledge regarding the role of miRNAs during RNA virus infection lead to the development of miRNA therapeutics or targeted viral expression vectors?\nBox 4The Clinician's CornermiRNAs play a role in many different processes within a cell by regulating the production of cellular proteins. miRNA regulation of the innate immune response modulates the production of antiviral molecules by enhancing their response during the initiation of innate immunity, but also by downregulating this response to prevent aberrant physiological responses and/or immunopathology in a host.Cell-specific miRNA expression directly contributes to the pathogenesis of medically important viruses either by promoting avoidance of the innate immune response (e.g., EEEV) or by stabilizing the viral genome and enhancing viral replication (e.g., HCV).Other miRNAs can be regulated via viral infection to establish a pro- or antiviral environment. miRNA expression patterns can be used to identify a viral infection and help to determine whether a viral strain is pathogenic or attenuated.In the future miRNAs might be used as antiviral therapeutics to prevent certain viral infections. Furthermore, the incorporation of tissue-specific miRNAs into viral vaccine and gene therapy vectors might enhance the specific targeting of viral proteins and/or, hopefully, limit adverse reactions due to infection.",
