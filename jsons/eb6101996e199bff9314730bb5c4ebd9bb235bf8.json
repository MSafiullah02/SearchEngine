A probable case is defined when the patient fits one of the 2 situations:(I) A suspected case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive (inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory); (II) A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason. A confirmed case is determined as a person with laboratory confirmation of the COVID-19 infection following the WHO technical guidance for laboratory testing, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. Contact is defined as a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and 14 days after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:(I) Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 m (or 3.28084 ft) and for more than 15 min (being in the same setting with the confirmed case without necessarily having direct physical contact); (II) Direct physical contact with probable or confirmed case (faceto-face contact with direct physical contact); (III) Direct care for patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal protection equipment (prolonged direct physical contact with cases). (IV) Other situations as indicated by local risk assessment (e.g.:agglomerations in public settings, public transport). Symptomatic transmission refers to transmission from a person while symptoms and signs are present. Preliminary data suggest that individuals may be more contagious around the time of the symptom onset as compared to later on in the disease. Epidemiological and virology studies provide evidence that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from symptomatic subjects to others who are in close contact through respiratory droplets, by direct contact with infected persons, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. Pre-symptomatic transmission is the period between the exposure to the virus (becoming infected) and the onset of the symptoms in which the transmission can occur from an infected non-symptomatic subject. This period, also known as incubation period for COVID-19 is on average 5 to 6 days, but can be up to 14 days. Asymptomatic transmission refers to transmission of the virus from a person who does not develop symptoms. An asymptomatic laboratory confirmed case is a person infected with COVID-19 who does not develop symptoms. COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g.: trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death. In emergency situations codes are not always accessible in electronic systems. The specification of category U07 in the way it is done here will make sure this category and the subcategories are available in every electronic system at any time and that they can be used upon instruction by WHO, immediately.
