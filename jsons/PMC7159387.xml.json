The owner feels that they are not growing as she would expect and that they have both shown intermittent mixed, mainly large intestinal, diarrhoea of two months\u2019 duration, with large quantities of mucoid stools, urgency and faecal tenesmus. This has partially responded to previous treatment with kaolin/probiotics, broad\u2010spectrum anthelmintics (fenbendazole, Panacur [Intervet] at nine weeks of age and pyrantel/praziquantel, Drontal Cat [Bayer] three weeks previously) and dietary adjustment (Feline i/d, Hill's) from your colleague. The kittens have been vaccinated during a period of relative wellbeing. Malaise is also reported, and coincides with the episodes of most severe diarrhoea. Clinical examination notes poor body condition but is otherwise normal.",
