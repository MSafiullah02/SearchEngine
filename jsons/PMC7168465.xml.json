In Singapore, 238 people were infected and 33 died. The disease was severe, transmissible from person to person, and has caused clusters of disease among health\u2010care workers in particular. SARS outbreaks also happened in South\u2010East Asia, North America, Europe, and became the first pandemic of the 21st century. As of the time of writing, 13 more people (with 1 dead) were diagnosed with SARS in Beijing and Anhui (May 2004). It is estimated that SARS has caused a financial loss over U.S. $35 billion worldwide.",

Fever, which is often thought essential for diagnosis, is also seen in patients with common cold; thus, it is problematic to define \u201csuspected cases\u201d on the basis of fever. Sending the suspected cases to hospital for specific laboratory tests is thus necessary after confirmation of the person's actual body temperature reading with usual clinical thermometer. As quoted in the Canada National Post:\n4\n \u201cSARS scanners praised as placebo. Health Canada report: Cost $2\u2010million, of the 462 000 people screened in the first month of operation, 341 had fevers, but no SARS cases, yet \u2018build confidence\u2019.\u201d Current infrared (IR) systems in use at various boarder checkpoints have not been scientifically validated particularly in regards to the false negative rate.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n As a result they may create a false sense of security by underestimating the number of febrile (and possibly infected) individuals. The unadjusted mode threshold temperature setting in a thermal imager needs to correct for the difference between the skin and core body temperatures. It then has to take into account the effects of ambient conditions and the thermal imager's performance parameters.",

            "text": "Presently, there is a lack of empirical data in correlating facial skin with body temperature. Obtaining a meaningful temperature for the human body therefore requires identifying a suitable facial site that will provide reliable data across a large population since skin temperature does not solely depend on body temperature and may be affected by other physiological and environmental factors. Besides, the use of skin temperature as a proxy to the body temperature may be inaccurate at some stages of fever. When the fever starts, the body intends to raise its temperature and vasoconstriction happens to prevent a reduction heat loss through the skin. The skin temperature will, hence, be cold at that moment where the IR radiation may not reach the set threshold for the thermal scanner to pick out. As also known, a few patients who have underling diseases (such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or in the postoperative state would present without fever at the early stage of SARS infection. Thus, the thermal scanner and even the clinical diagnostic criteria have important limitations that might lead to false positive or negative diagnoses in the worse case. This technical note aims to discuss the effectiveness of thermal scanner for blind screening of fever subjects.",

The subjects are considered febrile if his/her mean ear temperature is >=37.7\u00b0C for adult (37.9\u00b0C for children) using Braun Thermoscan IRT 3520+. Results are drawn for the two important pieces of information: the best and yet practical region on the face to screen and guidance on optimal preset threshold temperature for the handheld radiometric IR ThermaCAM S60 FLIR system.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n The focal length from the subject to scanner was fixed at 2m and the duration of time patients must be scanned was 3s. The detector was a focal plane array, uncooled microbolometer 320\u00d7240 pixels with a thermal sensitivity of 0.06\u00b0C at 30\u00b0C, spectral range of 7.5\u201313\u03bcm and measurement accuracy at \u00b12% of the real\u2010time reading.\n14\n The average temperature of the skin surface was measured from the field of view of the thermal imager with an appropriate adjustment for skin emissivity. Human skin emissivity may vary from site to site ranging from 0.94 to 0.99 (0.98 was used here). The following spots were logged and analyzed from the frontal profiles: forehead; eye region; average cheeks; nose; mouth (closed); and average temples. The images were further processed to obtain readings from both frontal and side profiles from some of the subjects. Figures 1, 2 present an example of the processed thermal images of both frontal and side (left) profiles from the same subject. The following spots were logged from the subjects with frontal and side profiles: forehead; eye region; average cheeks; nose; mouth (closed); average temple; side face; ears; and side temple. Figure 3 further illustrates an example of temperature profiles from a temperature operation using thermal imager with temperature reading. Reproducibility of both the instrument and physiological assumptions was established by comparing paired left\u2010right readings of the temples and cheeks.\n12\n\n",

            "text": "Figure 4 shows an example of the regression line obtained with skin temperatures extracted from the near inner eye range. Table I indicates that the thermal imagers hold much promise for mass screening when the readings from the front averaged temples region have good correlation with the ear temperature, followed by maximum temperature in near\u2010eye and forehead regions. Figure 5 presents the ROC curve obtained and Table II is the ROC report. A randomly selected individual from the fever group has a test value larger than that for a randomly selected individual from the normal group in 90.7% of the time. The ROC test can distinguish between the normal and febrile groups and an optimum threshold temperature (marked as * in Table II) for the thermal imager, to detect an adult aural temperature of 37.7\u00b0C and above, is 34.6\u00b0C and this allows sensitivity of 90.7% and specificity of 75.8%. (In fact, by drawing a vertical line in Fig. 4 at skin temp=34.6\u00b0C and a horizontal line at body temp=37.7\u00b0C, one can quickly assess the sensitivity and specificity that matches the prediction from ROC with MedCalc. Note that there are 3\u00d7 as many data points in the lower left box than in the top left box due to overlapping of operating points for normal temperature range.) This setting is dependent on the values of sensitivity and specificity (both to be high) from the ROC analysis results. Any temperature readings that exceed this setting will trigger off the alarm and there is need to verify the fact.",

Such tests will have to be carefully planned and conducted, since the number of febrile subjects walking through airports, for example, is probably quite low. This step is thus essential, however, if we are to rely on IR imaging for SARS screening, since there is already general criticism that the method produces a false sense of security. Generally, different people do not always measure success in the same way. In the case of SARS, thermography probably did play a positive role during the SARS crisis, as far as psychological warfare (political) was concerned. The lesson is that we could have done a much better job of actually finding SARS cases if the methodology used had been correct implemented.",
