Except for cases in Korea in 2015, most infections with MERS-CoV (82%) have occurred in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The total number of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection is 2040 with 712 deaths related to MERS-CoV infection since September 2012. Thus, the human mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection is approximately 35% [3].",

The main viral protein is the spike protein, which binds to the cell surface receptor DPP4 during the viral entry stage via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike subunit S1 [5]. Because the spike protein is the most immunogenic structural protein [6], [7], the final goal of most current studies of MERS-CoV vaccines is to elicit neutralizing antibodies against this specific MERS-CoV spike protein.",

Previous studies have investigated viral vector-based vaccines [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], subunit vaccines [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], and DNA vaccines [18], [19]. Of these, vaccination using viral vectors or DNA immunization successfully generated neutralizing antibodies and protected against infection [12]. However, safety concerns about DNA vaccines and their weak induction of neutralizing antibodies plus the possibility of reduced efficacy of viral vector vaccines because of preexisting immunity against the viral vectors induced by repeated immunization cannot be ignored. Although protein subunit vaccines can induce neutralizing antibody, they usually elicit a lower level of cellular immune response which has close association with rapid viral clearance when infection occurs. In addition, subunit vaccines could not induce enough immune responses in host, resulting in failure to make long-term memory of antigen [20].",

            "text": "Although the first MERS-CoV outbreak occurred in 2012, there is still no commercially licensed MERS-CoV vaccine for human use. Therefore, there has been much research on how to present effectively the main target antigen, spike protein. Previous studies have reported the effectiveness of DNA vaccines containing the spike protein gene [18], [19], spike protein itself [13], [17], RBD subunit vaccines [14], [15], [16], and viral vectors including modified vaccinia virus Ankara and adenovirus [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] for immunization of mice or nonhuman primates. Subunit vaccines, such as spike protein and RBD protein, induced neutralizing antibody against MERS-CoV, indicating the induction of a humoral immune response, and the DNA vaccine triggered the activation of cytotoxic T cells, indicating the induction of a cellular immune response. However, subunit vaccines usually induce weak cellular immune and Th1 cell responses, whereas DNA vaccines induce weak humoral immune and Th2 cell responses [20], [23], [24].",

In contrast, Ad5/MERS induced MERS spike protein-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells, which indicated the activation of Th1 cells. Moreover, the levels of effector cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, GM-CSF, and IFN-\u03b3 that were produced after stimulation of cultured splenocytes with CD8+ T cell-specific peptide were higher in the Ad5/MERS-immunized groups.

            "text": "However, although the Ad5 vector has some advantages for use in development of vaccines, such as the induction of cellular immune responses and easy production [25], previous studies have reported that repeated injections of recombinant Ad5 reduced the presentation of the targeted antigen to antigen-presenting cells because of the presence of preexisting antibody against Ad5, and that this preexisting antibody, which was induced by the first (priming) vaccination, prevented further immune responses. This could be because of the low titers of neutralizing antibody induced by Ad5/MERS [26], [27]. To overcome this problem of preexisting antibody, several approaches have been developed [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. One approach was to increase the dose of viral vector, but high-dose injection increased its cytotoxicity. Another approach was to change the surface antigen of the adenovirus vector used for booster immunizations to a rare serotype to evade the preexisting antibody [28], [29], [30], [31]. However, the concern with this strategy is the difficulty of mass production of two types of recombinant viruses, although packaging of the adenoviral vector with polymer [32], [33] and/or administration of adenovirus through other routes, such as mucosal or nasal inoculation, may circumvent this problem [34], [35]. Furthermore, these methods are dependent on the experimental conditions or the researcher\u2019s skill. Therefore, to overcome this disadvantage but to take advantage of a viral vector vaccine, in this study we used a heterologous prime\u2013boost vaccination strategy, in which Ad5/MERS was used for the first (priming) vaccination to activate the cellular immune response and then MERS spike protein nanoparticles was used for the second and third (first and second booster) vaccinations to activate the humoral immune response. As shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, this strategy induced both specific neutralizing antibody and Th1 cells against MERS spike protein, indicating that it could effectively trigger a cellular immune response by priming with Ad5/MERS and bypass the limitations of viral vectors by boosting with MERS spike protein nanoparticles.",

            "text": "A recent study analyzing patients who survived MERS virus infection demonstrated that survival depended on induction of both a cell-mediated immune response and neutralizing antibody [36]. The analysis showed a correlation between the severity of symptoms, the activation of T cells extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the intensity of the antibody response. According to these data, patients with stronger activation of a MERS-specific CD8+ T cell response showed faster viral clearance and had relatively shorter exposure to the virus. In this regard, adenovirus vaccines, which are known to increase cellular immune responses via activation of CD8+ T cells [26], [37], [38], [39], may be strategic candidates for a MERS vaccine. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that both the Ad5/MERS\u2013spike protein group and the spike protein group were protected against MERS-CoV challenge, as indicated by smaller body weight loss and less severe lung pathology after MERS-CoV infection. However, the spike protein group did not induce a Th1 immune response, but rather a Th2 immune response including induction of neutralizing antibody. This imbalance of Th1/Th2 responses suggests that immunization with spike protein nanoparticles alone may provide short-term protection against virus infection but not long-term maintenance of a protective immune response.",

            "text": "Previously, formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine induced severe vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (VERD) after natural RSV infection [41]. Therefore, our safety concern is that VERD, even during a long interval between vaccination and natural infection, may increase MERS-CoV because it is another respiratory virus [1]. It has also been shown that the induction of allergic and biased Th2 immune responses and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the airways and lungs are the main characteristics of VERD in RSV-inactivated vaccines [42], [43]. Our heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy with Ad5/MERS and spike protein nanoparticle clearly showed a balanced induction of Th1 and Th2 immune responses. Therefore, this vaccine strategy may be safe. However, it requires more detailed study.",
