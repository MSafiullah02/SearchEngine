However, we should be aware that ICT should help address and not add to existing inequities both within societies and between LMICs [13]. The use of electronic or faxed prescriptions and \u2018mail-order\u2019 or \u2018home-delivery\u2019 pharmacy models to facilitate remote healthcare are all potential solutions that can help ensure ongoing pharmaceutical supply to patients whilst minimising the need for in-person interactions [8, 14]. However, the technology required to support these models of care delivery are not fully integrated in some countries, including many LMICs. As pharmacies in other higher income Commonwealth countries such as the UK, Australia and NZ move towards these new models of delivery [15], we must ensure that LMICs are not left behind. There is reassuring evidence to suggest this will not be the case. With increasingly widespread mobile phone use, African nations have pioneered in mobile banking, which is widely used across the continent since mPesa was established in 2007 [16]. Initiatives, such as the launch of the Ghanaian COVID-19 tracker app [17] follow this trend of digital innovation.",

There is a large evidence base demonstrating widespread problems with poor quality antimicrobial drugs and other essential medicines in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [20, 21]. The COVID-19 pandemic only serves to exacerbate such issues, including the risk of misinformation and false claims, for example through the use of SF medication for preventing and treating COVID-19 [22, 23]. Poor quality medicines are a significant barrier to UHC and undermine efforts to improve healthcare [24]. Consequences of using SF medicines include antimicrobial resistance, adverse drug reactions, toxicity, and treatment failure [19]. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increased urgent need to fast-track the development of technologies to counter falsified claims, detect poor quality medicines and save lives, as well as share innovation in this area. For example, the MPedigree barcode scanning app has been implemented in several African countries to allow checking of the validity of medicines [25]. Additionally, new technologies such as PharmaCheck, which uses a handheld scanner to analyse medicines, offer competitive new ICT solutions [19] to build regulatory technical capacity. Medicines quality assurance requires a robust regulatory system overseen by a medicines regulatory agency, however in many LMICs this is limited by resource and capacity constraints. However, pharmacoviligance reporting apps developed by regulatory authorities in Ghana [26] and Zambia [27], highlight how digital innovation can enhance regulatory systems. Real-time \u2018point of sale\u2019 reporting devices or mobile apps such as \u2018MedSnap\u2019, a mobile phone app that is capable of identifying medications, and assist with the data collection and monitoring of SF medicines [28], is currently being trialled by the CPA in partnership with the Pharmaceutical Society of Zambia. This is intended to synergise with the pharmacoviligance reporting app developed by the FDA to build greater medicines regulatory capacity.",

Shared common information platforms, such as the online resource portals created by national pharmacy associations and international organisations such as the CPA and International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), can facilitate the timely exchange of news, alerts on outbreaks, opportunities for collaborations and support continuing professional development (CPD) between pharmacists. To facilitate this, regional and national policies and ICT linkages need to be established, as well as infrastructure to support access to stable internet and connectivity particularly in rural and deprived areas. CPD to improve pharmacist technology literacy will also need to be prioritised [33]. For example, in Zambia, there is an increasing demand for pharmacy services, with growing numbers of pharmacists keen to upskill and evolve new roles to expand the breadth of the profession. In line with a recent change to mandatory CPD, the CPA have worked closely with Zambia to explore the opportunities for delivering CPD via an online learning platform to address pharmacist training gaps. Many medicine information resources and centres are online, which can act as repositories of evidence-based information. However, in many healthcare settings, internet access can be intermittent and there is a need for easy access to key information, compiled in one place that can be made available offline. A successful example of this is the Commonwealth Partnerships for Antimicrobial Stewardship (CwPAMS) app which supports the rational use of antimicrobials, beginning with Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia [34].",

Ensuring the right antimicrobials are used for secondary infections where indicated, but not inappropriately used for COVID-19, is particularly relevant; the current CwPAMS prescribing app is an example of an innovation that has developed COVID-19 specific resources to support this [34]. Indeed, the time could not be more apt to be embracing digitalisation. At the 2019 annual conference of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana, the Vice President of Ghana called for pharmacists to embrace digitalisation, enhancing patient recordkeeping and medicines access, noting their expanding and evolving role in supporting a health system moving towards UHC [31].",

Local manufacturing can support the provision of more cost-effective quality treatments, such as has been recognised by several member countries. The Commonwealth can achieve this by promoting local manufacturing capacity through supporting local companies to become Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) compliant, establishing bioequivalence centres to support the local industry, providing financial support (e.g. long-term, low-interest patient capital), and linking to other countries with strong local manufacturing capacity (e.g. India, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Kenya, Ghana), which can help increase global competitiveness. For example, in Ghana, initiatives to foster a manufacturing \u2018hub\u2019 are anticipated to foster economic growth in the pharmaceutical sector and improve access to quality assured medicines. This includes tax exemption on raw materials and essential medicines produced locally and a 15% local price preferment strategy [41]. In tandem, the Ghana pharmaceutical sector development strategy includes capital loans to incentivise producing medicines on the national health insurance list [42].",

This helps to safeguard sustainable practice and overall responsibility to uptake methods to reduce the environmental impact of medicines [48]. Disposal of medicines is also costly with some countries facing fees charged by regulators to dispose medicines, or high costs to use incinerators to safely dispose pharmaceuticals [49]. Countries need to move towards free disposals to encourage more responsible disposal, for example by developing guidelines and allocating funding to provide the needed infrastructure to support safe disposal of medicines, green and eco-friendly manufacturing, and campaigns to promote public awareness [50]. Of particular importance is the need to consider safe disposal of antimicrobials, as inappropriate disposal, for example of antibiotics into waste water [51], can worsen antimicrobial resistance.",

Never has the world seen such a focus on pharmacy service provision; the advantages of the dual-role of community pharmacists as retailer and health provider have emerged [53] as countries have gone into lockdown and pharmacists are named as a \u2018vital\u2019 part of the healthcare system as one of the few essential services that can remain open to the public. Beyond the pandemic, we need to ensure that this significance of pharmacists as an essential health provider is not diminished. There needs to be ongoing support at the national and global level for pharmacy services to be implemented in their full potential. This is particularly important when considering the shortfall of 18 million health workers by 2030 that is projected by WHO and the amplification of this problem in LMICs [6]. Pharmacists are skilled worldwide to provide more extensive public-facing services \u2013 such as family planning, HIV testing, screening, and vaccination. These extended pharmacy services \u2013 particularly vaccination services \u2013 will be key for achieving population vaccination coverage when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, especially as pharmacies are one of the most accessible health providers in the community [54]. The effectiveness of utilising pharmacists for public health interventions has been highlighted through Commonwealth initiatives led by female pharmacist groups to set-up clinical breast screening and raise awareness to reach the most vulnerable communities. This would help with healthcare access for the public yet policy-level barriers need to be overcome to enable full utilisation of the pharmacy workforce globally, as well as cold-chain issues.",

            "text": "New policies may be needed to support the evolution of pharmacy practice, for example the establishment of senior pharmacist roles at the government level, and involvement of national pharmacy associations in the creation and implementation of health policies. Pharmacists should be key stakeholders on all discussions involving medicines if systems and policies are to be well thought out and effective. Governments need pharmacist skillsets, but steps need to be taken to strengthen the profession and ensure they are appropriately regulated and recognised. This good governance facilitates better regulation of medicines, pharmacists and pharmacies. Without legislation or governance that specifically defines pharmacist roles and pharmacy practice, it is difficult to advocate for the expanding role of pharmacists. For example, in Zambia, the pharmacy profession is not currently self-regulated despite 60% of budget being spent on pharmaceuticals. There is a need for pharmacists to have their own pharmacy council to clarify roles and functions of regulatory agencies, whilst preventing overlap in functions leading to over-regulation and associated financial burdens. Pharmacy councils are needed to address issues at a national level collectively via implementation of regulations. For example, the Pharmacy Council and Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana, together with Management Sciences for Health (MSH), conducted a pharmaceutical service mapping exercise of a rural region in Ghana to highlight gaps to improve access to quality assured medicines. Other examples of issues where collaborative actions are required include SF medicines and its contribution to AMR, ensuring honest and corruption-free systems, and reviewing licencing systems so licenses to practice are based on a minimum required level of skill and knowledge to ensure public safety. For example, community unregulated sale of medicines, such as at markets and stores, in particular antibiotics, are of high concern in many LMICs [55]. The CwPAMS has brought together practitioners and policy makers and raised these issues leading to acknowledgment and action by pharmacy councils to work with unlicensed sellers of antibiotics to address these issues [34]. There is potential for the CPA to support this by creating online knowledge sharing symposia, webinars or online workshops.",
