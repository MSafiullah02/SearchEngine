All patients hospitalized between October 2014 and March 2015 were eligible for inclusion in the study. During the study period, an ASP pharmacist reviewed the results of PCR-based DRPs using a computer decision support system (TheraDoc, Charlotte, NC) between 10 AM and 3 PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, and paged medical teams with recommendations during these hours. ASP pharmacist recommendations included deescalating antibiotics to complete a course appropriate for community-acquired pneumonia for a subset of these patients when the medical team opted to continue antibiotics.",

Low antibiotic deescalation rates of 10%-20% have been reported in previous studies despite positive DRP results.4, 8 Although 66% of ASP recommendations were accepted overall in our study, only 19% of recommendations to deescalate or discontinue antibiotics were accepted, consistent with these previously published studies.",

The mean time from test resulting in an antibiotic change was 13.5 hours. This highlights a potential opportunity for ASPs to facilitate action sooner based on these data. Further studies are needed to explore the reasons behind failure to deescalate antibiotics despite the availability of DRP results with ASP interpretation. Although rapid diagnostic testing with real-time ASP interpretation and intervention is very promising, the best use of ASP personnel in the reporting and interpretation of these tests remains to be determined.",
