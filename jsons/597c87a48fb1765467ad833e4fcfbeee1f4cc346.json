In the PALM trial, 6.1% hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin trial for outpatient treatment of milder disease. Recent data suggesting potential link with macrolides and fetal malformation will require additional counseling regarding the risk and benefits of azithromycin for prophylaxis for participants enrolling in early pregnancy [10] . These few studies, which allow inclusion of pregnant women, are in-line with recommendations from multiple Institutional Review Boards which support the policy of providing pregnant women with the same opportunities as non-pregnant women to participate in research, provided that participants are counseled on the known or possible reproductive or lactation risks from the study, and measures that will be taken to minimize them. Per our own institutional IRB guidance, research inclusive of pregnant women increases the likelihood that the knowledge gained can be extended judiciously to this population.",

This trial was specifically designed to incorporate the needed flexibility and complexity for rapid rigorous assessment of experimental treatments, with efficacious treatments becoming the control for newer investigational agents. Similarly, the World Health-sponsored SOLIDARITY trial (ISRCTN83971151) strives to remove barriers to implementing a large scale trial by simplifying procedures and outcomes, including minimizing the burden of data collection to basic baseline characteristics and comorbidities, randomizing patients to locally available drugs or standard of care, with no additional measurements or documentation after enrollment; final outcome is the day the patient leaves the hospital or dies, and whether they required oxygenation or ventilation. Despite acknowledging that pregnant women may have a higher risk of infection in the trial registration, SOLIDARITY also excludes pregnant women. In stark contrast to these inventive efforts employed by investigators and swift support of regulatory bodies and funders in response to the pandemic, the continued exclusion of pregnant and lactating women represents exnovation; the opposite of innovation.Although data is limited, there is widespread use of hydroxychloroquine for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in several settings, and the United States Food and Drug Administration recently authorized its emergency use while encouraging the conduct and participation in randomized controlled trials to confirm efficacy[8]. There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine confers minimal fetal or maternal risk in case series of pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune disease; a recent meta-analysis of 800 women taking hydroxychloroquine in pregnancy found no increase in pregnancy complications or congenital malformations, but noted a significant increase in spontaneous abortions that may be attributed to underlying autoimmune disease[9]. While multiple trials are evaluating efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for treatment and post-exposure",

PRGLAC identified a need to alter cultural assumptions that have significantly limited scientific knowledge of therapeutic product safety, effectiveness, and dosing for pregnant and lactating women. In response to the exclusion of pregnant and lactating women in COVID-19 clinical trials, the Coalition to Advance Maternal Therapeutics (CAMT), comprised of more than twenty organizations, has urged NIH and FDA leadership to use their authorities to ensure development of vaccines and therapeutics for pregnant and lactating women, and to proactively remove barriers and work with sponsors and researchers to ensure their inclusion in critical COVID-19 research [12]. Both PRGLAC and CAMT have advocated for a 'cultural shift to protect women through research rather than protecting them from research'. Pregnant women are a unique but not uncommon population and they deserve the opportunity for fair and ethical inclusion and close safety monitoring afforded by carefully designed clinical trials. While it is highly unlikely there will be dedicated clinical trials focused in pregnancy, we should ensure inclusion of pregnant and lactating women within ongoing large scale clinical trial efforts. Too often research includes pregnant women well after the establishment of efficacy in non-pregnant population, if done at all. The COVID-19 pandemic offers the opportunity, and requires the urgency, to engage pregnant women early in the science in order to develop data-driven recommendations regarding the risks and benefits of therapies for which they may benefit.",
