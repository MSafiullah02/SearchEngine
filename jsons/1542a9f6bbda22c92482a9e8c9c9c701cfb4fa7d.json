This study is interesting and provides the direction for future researches, however, there is a need to address the importance of standardized definition of COVID-19 related liver injury, which is currently unavailable; it also , and calls for an international consensus in this regard.",

It is worthwhile to explore the mechanisms and clinical outcomes of liver dysfunction for better understanding and treatment of COVID-19. However, as a new contagious disease, there is no consensus on the definition of COVID-19 associated liver injury at present, and its definition varies in recent studies (Table 1) .",

Several studies also included alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT) for the assessment of liver function 6,7 , probably because the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, was reported to be highly expressed in cholangiocytes 8 . Interestingly, current study included lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a parameter for liver damage in COVID-19 patients 1 , which was normally regarded as an indicator for heart, kidney and liver dysfunction, and thus may be less specific in this regard. The difference on diagnostic parameters may affect the grouping of liver injury and non-liver injury, and thus compromise the results.",

In 4 contrast, Zhang et al. 7 reported that although the impairment of liver function did exist in COVID-19, it was not a prominent feature and may not have serious clinical consequences. Notably, in these studies, some researchers defined liver injury as any liver function parameter test above the upper limit of normal (ULN) 1,5 , however, others defined it as liver enzymes higher than two or three times of ULN 9 , or according to the guideline of drug-induced liver injury 7 , which may be the reason for the controversial mixed results. Together with the comment published by Bangash et al. 10 , we think it may be inappropriate to consider the mild elevation and fluctuation of liver enzymes (i.e. just slightly above the ULN) as the clinically significant liver injury, which may be predominantly a clinical distraction.",
