In addition, rationale for conducting future research in the area of nurses\u2019 experiences of intent to respond and working during major disasters is discussed. An extensive review of the literature was completed using health care literature databases including CINAHL, Medline (Ovid), PubMed, and PsycINFO. In 1974, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act was signed into law, establishing the process by which presidents could declare disasters in states overwhelmed by catastrophic events. Therefore, the literature review was limited to the past 36 years. Keywords entered into the databases were nursing, disaster, hurricane, posttraumatic stress, and preparedness. The search revealed a vast amount of disaster-related literature, which was categorized into 8 thematic sections: (a) defining disaster, (b) nursing during and after disaster, (c) nursing education in disaster preparedness, (d) military nurse preparedness, (e) postdisaster stress, (f) ethical issues and intent to respond, (g) policy, and (h) hospital emergency policy.",

A comprehensive definition for disaster is difficult to locate in the literature\u2014most definitions are either too broad or too narrow, and many organizations have created their own definitions for the term. For the purpose of this review, the definition of the term that was deemed most appropriate was that used by the American Red Cross (ARC), which defines disaster as:A threatening or occurring event of such destructive magnitude and force as to dislocate people, separate family members, damage or destroy homes, and injure or kill people. A disaster produces a range and level of immediate suffering and basic human needs that cannot be promptly or adequately addressed by the affected people, and impedes them from initiating and proceeding with their recovery efforts. Natural disasters include floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, winter storms, tsunamis, hail storms, wildfires, windstorms, epidemics, and earthquakes. Human-caused disasters\u2014whether intentional or unintentional\u2014include residential fires, building collapses, transportation accidents, hazardous materials releases, explosions, and domestic acts of terrorism.7\n",

The sample included 16 perinatal nurses who worked during Hurricane Katrina. The purpose of the study was to make explicit the perinatal nurses\u2019 shared meanings of their lived experience of providing care in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Major themes that emerged from the study include (a) duty to care, (b) conflicts in duty, (c) uncertain times, (d) strength to endure, (e) grief, (f) anger, and (g) feeling right again. Findings demonstrated that nurses who work during disasters must live through the uncertainty of the situation and be prepared to adapt to the needs that arise in both patient care and self-preservation situations. This study revealed that primary resources needed by nurses while working during a disaster include excellent basic nursing skills, intuitive problem solving, and a sense of staff unity. Researchers noted that the nurses exhibited a wide range of problems related to stress. These problems included changed sleep patterns, change in mood, eating problems, substance abuse, and avoidance behaviors. At the same time, it was recognized that the nurse participants practiced in harmony with duty to care values and demonstrated behaviors of strength, courage, and resilience.8\n",

The sample of nurses was recruited from 3 Midwest hospitals that were designated as receiving sites for evacuees. The purpose of the study was to identify beliefs and concerns of nurses who worked in hospitals designated as receiving sites during public health emergencies. Abandonment was the major theme that emerged from the focus group interviews. This theme was supported by subthemes including: chaos, unsafe environment, loss of freedom, and limited institutional commitment. Nurses felt that policies were not well thought out, and that they were left out of the communication loop. In addition, the nurses stated that they did not receive any preparedness training to handle bioterrorist events.13 Nurses believed that in the event of a bioterrorist attack, there would be a disruption in normal staffing resources. Aware that nurse staffing under normal conditions is at times already strained, the nurses feared that they would not be free to leave the workplace. Therefore, these researchers reported that the participants in the study believed that a shortage of nursing staff would be indirectly related to nurses who refused to work during a disaster. A limitation of this study is the small number of participants in some of the focus groups, which might have limited the discussions.",

The sample consisted of 41 female school nurses from across the state of Louisiana who attended an Annual School Nurse Conference held in March 2006. Nurse participants had an average age 48 years. Researchers reported that the participants were from all areas of Louisiana, including areas that were not in the path of either hurricane. Participants were asked one question: \u201cPlease share your experiences and feelings about Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita\u201d.10 In addition to the qualitative question, demographic data were collected that included: (a) age, (b) years of experience as a school nurse, (c) gender, (d) support systems loss or damage to home and vehicle, (e) damage to school, and (f) change in work assignment as a result of the storm. Data analysis was not described; however, findings were categorized into 2 major themes: personal impact and professional impact. Personal impact included 3 subthemes: (a) uncertainty, (b) helplessness, and (c) thankfulness. Professional impact included 2 themes: practice challenges and practice rewards. The participants portrayed a wide array of emotions and feelings that were similar to previous studies. Researchers recommended that all school nurses would benefit from having both formal and informal support systems and mental health services available to them in the aftermath of future hurricanes.10 Identifying the philosophic underpinnings as well as the method for data analysis and rigor would have strengthened the validity of this study.",

It has been recognized in the literature that PTSD can develop soon after experiencing a traumatic event.30 During times of disaster, caregivers and first responders react immediately to address physical injuries. However, these same caregivers have a tendency to react slowly or ignore injuries to themselves that are concealed deep within the consciousness. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) defines PTSD as:An anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, or military combat.31\n",

The study sample included 51 emergency department employees located in urban Canada. Seventy-three percent of the participants were identified as nurses. PTSD was assessed using the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS). Stress was measured using the Health Professionals\u2019 Stress Inventory\u2014Revised (HPSI-R). Both scales were reported to have a Cronbach alpha of .80 or higher, which is adequate for internal consistency. Major findings included that 12% of the participants met all of the criteria for PTSD. Eighty-two percent of the respondents confirmed they did not attend debriefing sessions provided by the hospital and 100% of the respondents reported they did not receive professional help for stress outside of the workplace. In addition, results revealed that 20% of the participants reported they had considered changing jobs after stressful incidents. Researchers concluded that this study supports the need for employers to provide emotional support for workers who have experienced working during disaster or other traumatizing events that may lead to long-term emotional upset.37\n",

A second objective of the study was to inform nurses of the psychosocial effects that they may experience as health care providers working during disaster situations. These researchers revealed that nurses may experience stress-related psychosocial consequences that continue well past the disaster. Relevant factors that must be taken into account are: (a) level of exposure to the disaster, (b) environmental or working conditions and management practices, (c) nurses\u2019 perceptions and individual coping and stress reduction practices, and (d) the amount and type of training and previous experience. Hughes and colleagues9 state that nurses are the largest entity of the emergency response team and need to be included from the beginning of emergency planning.

Brewin and colleagues38 state that in order for PTSD screening instruments to be useful, they must be brief, consist of the minimum number of items necessary for accurate identification, and be written in a language that is easy to read. Furthermore, the symptoms of PTSD and ASD that may be experienced by nurses responding specifically to a major hurricane disaster may be different. Thus, one must first explore these perspectives by asking those who actually did respond and work in an affected facility.

It was also recognized that professional ethical guidelines are needed to help HCWs fulfill their duties in cases of pandemics.41 Although this study revealed interesting information regarding the HCW\u2019s willingness to report to work during a pandemic, the survey used to complete the study was a newly developed instrument, and reliability and validity have not been established.",

The survey was sent to 531 employees of 3 major health departments in Maryland, with a return of 308 surveys. Clinical staff, nurses, physicians, and dentists accounted for 102 of the respondents. Data were analyzed using logistic regression to evaluate the association of demographic variables, and attitudes and beliefs with self-described likelihood of reporting to work during a pandemic disaster. The researchers studied the association between attitudes and beliefs related to pandemic preparedness and the self-reported likelihood of reporting to work. Of the 308 participants, only 163 (53.8%) stated that they would most likely report to work during a pandemic emergency. Forty percent noted that they would be asked by their health department to respond during an influenza pandemic event. Balicer and colleagues3 reported that 66% of all participants perceived themselves to be at risk when performing their duties during a pandemic event. It was concluded that to reduce the perceived personal threat during a pandemic and increase the likelihood of employees responding during influenza pandemics, HCPs would benefit from continuing education regarding pandemics. These individuals must be assured that adequate protective equipment and psychological support would be made available to responders. Researchers also concluded that if employees are unwilling to respond during an influenza pandemic emergency, this behavior may cause a considerable deficit in national emergency response plans. Limitations to this study include the use of a subjective self-report survey and subject recruitment from 3 clinics in Maryland, therefore findings cannot be generalized to other populations. Lastly, the power of the study was not reported.3\n",

This study was guided by Icek Ajzen\u2019s Theory of Planned Behavior. A sample of 313 licensed nurses in Texas who completed a state board of nursing mandated 2-hour bioterrorism continuing education class were recruited to participate in this study. Data were collected using 3 researcher-developed questionnaires. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16 was used to analyze data. According to the researchers, 292 participants completed all 3 questionnaires. The sample included both registered nurses (98%) and licensed vocational nurses (2%), with the majority being female (87%). Only 25% of the nurses who reported that they had a professional duty to respond also had a high intent-to-respond score. This significant finding raises concerns about adequate staffing during times of bioterrorism disasters or infectious disease events.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of Hurricane Katrina with respect to age on Mississippi nurses who worked during Hurricane Katrina. Nurses\u2019 ages in this sample ranged from 23 to 73 years. The sample was divided into 2 groups according to age: Group 1 was 23 to 45 years old and Group 2 was 46 to 73 years old. The researchers reported that there was a significant positive association between nurses aged 43 to 73 years and the development of poststorm depression, anxiety, PTSD, and lower health status when compared with nurses who were 23 to 45 years old. Older nurses developed more symptoms of stress-related disorders than the younger nurses. It was concluded that taking into consideration the growing shortage of nurses in the United States, it is important to understand how working during stressful situations affects older nurses, as retention of older nurses is important as a short-term resolution to the nursing shortage. This study used 7 self-report scales to gather data, which can be considered a limitation of the study. Self-report questionnaires are an excellent method to gain knowledge about a participant\u2019s feelings or beliefs; however, data gathered through self-report relies on the accuracy of the participant\u2019s subjective account and may also reveal socially desirable responses.44 The findings of this study relied solely on self-reported data; hence, the results must be reviewed with caution.",
