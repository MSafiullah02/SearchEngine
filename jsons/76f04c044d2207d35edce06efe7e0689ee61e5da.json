Then problem of optimizing sentinel surveillance in networks is to identify the nodes to probe such that an emerging disease outbreak can be discovered early or reliably. Whether the emphasis should be on early or reliable detection depends on the scenario in question. We investigate three objective measures from the literature quantifying the performance of nodes in sentinel surveillance: the time to detection or extinction, the time to detection, and the frequency of detection. As a basis for the comparison, we use the susceptible-infectious-recovered model on static and temporal networks of human contacts. We show that, for some regions of parameter space, the three objective measures can rank the nodes very differently. This means sentinel surveillance is a class of problems, and solutions need to chose an objective measure for the particular scenario in question. As opposed to other problems in network epidemiology, we draw similar conclusions from the static and temporal networks. Furthermore, we do not find one type of network structure that predicts the objective measures, i.e., that depends both on the data set and the SIR parameter values.",

Several concepts of mathematical epidemiology-like the basic reproductive number or core groups [1] [2] [3] -have entered the vocabulary of medical scientists. Traditionally, authors have modeled disease outbreaks in society by assuming any person to have the same chance of meeting anyone else at any time. This is of course not realistic, and improving this point is the motivation for network epidemiology: epidemic simulations between people connected by a network [4] . One can continue increasing the realism in the contact patterns by observing that the timing of contacts can also have structures capable of affecting the disease. Studying epidemics on time-varying contact structures is the basis of the emerging field of temporal network epidemiology [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

First, there are so many possible structures and correlations in temporal networks that one cannot tune them all in models [8] . It is also hard to identify the most important structures for a specific spreading phenomenon [8] . Second, studying empirical networks makes this paper-in addition to elucidating the objective measures of sentinel surveillance-a study of human interaction. We can classify data sets with respect how the epidemic dynamics propagate on them. As mentioned above, in practical sentinel surveillance, the network in question is rather one of hospitals, clinics or farms.

The simplest method would be to just include a link between any pair of nodes that has at least one contact during the course of the data set. This would however make some of the networks so dense that the static network structure of the node-pairs most actively in contact would be obscured. For our purpose, we primarily want our network to span many types of network structures that can impact epidemics. Without any additional knowledge about the epidemics, the best option is to threshold the weighted graph where an edge (i, j ) means that i and j had more than \u03b8 contacts in the data set. In this work, we assume that we do not know what the per-contact transmission probability \u03b2 is (this would anyway depend on both the disease and precise details of the interaction). Rather we scan through a very large range of \u03b2 values. Since we anyway to that, there is no need either to base the choice of \u03b8 on some epidemiological argument, or to rescale \u03b2 after the thresholding. Note that the rescaled \u03b2 would be a non-linear function of the number of contacts between i and j . (Assuming no recovery, for an isolated link with \u03bd contacts, the transmission probability is 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2 ) \u03bd .) For our purpose the only thing we need is that the rescaled \u03b2 is a monotonous function of \u03b2 for the temporal network (which is true).

Then, an infectious node recovers after a time that is exponentially distributed with average 1/\u03bd. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03bd are called infection rate and recovery rate, respectively. We can, without loss of generality, put \u03bd = 1/T (where T is the duration of the sampling).

The \u03c4 (t x , f d ) correlation is negative (of a similar magnitude), meaning that for most data sets the different methods would rank the possible sentinels in the same order. For some of the data sets, however, the correlation never becomes positive even for large \u03b2 values (like Copenhagen Calls and Copenhagen SMS). These networks are the most fragmented onesm meaning that one sentinel unlikely would detect the outbreak (since it probably happens in another component).

Panel (a) shows the results for the time to detection or extinction. There is a negative correlation between this measure and traditional centrality measures like degree or subgraph centrality. This is because t x is a quantity one wants to minimize to find the optimal sentinel, whereas for all the structural descriptors a large value means that a node is a candidate sentinel node. We see that degree and subgraph centrality are the two quantities that best predict the optimal sentinel location, while coreness is also close (at around \u22120.65). This in line with research showing that certain biological problems are better determined by degree than more elaborate centrality measures [51] . Over all, the \u03c4 curves are rather flat. This is partly explained by \u03c4 being a rank correlation For t d [ Fig. 4(b) ], most curves change behavior around \u03b2 = 0.2. This is the region when larger outbreaks could happen, so one can understand there is a transition to a situation similar to t x [ Fig. 4(a) ]. f d [Fig. 4(c) ] shows a behavior similar to t d in that the curves start changing order, and what was a correlation at low \u03b2 becomes an anticorrelation at high \u03b2. This anticorrelation is a special feature of this particular data set, perhaps due to its pronounced community structure. Nodes of degree 0, 1, and 2 have a strictly increasing values of f d , but for some of the high degree nodes (that all have f d close to one) the ordering gets anticorrelated with degree which makes Kendall's \u03c4 negative. Since rank-based correlations are more principled for skew-distributed quantities common in networks, we keep them. We currently investigate what creates these unintuitive anticorrelations among the high degree nodes in this data set.",

The time to detection is interesting if one wants to detect the outbreak early (or else it is not important), which could be the case if manufacturing new vaccine is relatively time consuming. We investigate these cases for 38 temporal network data sets and static networks derived from the temporal networks.",
