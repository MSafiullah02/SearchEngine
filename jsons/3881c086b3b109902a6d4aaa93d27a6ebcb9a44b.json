As further changes in medical school curricula continue to 137 occur, all ophthalmology departments need to remain vigilant for potential further 138 marginalization of required ophthalmology curriculum. It will be up to all of us, as 139 ophthalmologists together, to help spark a beginning foundation in ophthalmic knowledge. As 140 DMSEs and academic ophthalmology departments continue to lead innovative solutions within 141 medical schools, our specialty as a whole can continue to foster initial and longitudinal learning 142 through valuable shadowing and mentorship. Our continued evaluation of the system is crucial to 143 ensure the competence of graduating students and to ensure the future of our profession. thank Chaesik Kim, BSEE, from Wayne State University School of 147 Medicine for his statistical support, and Dr. Steven Feldon, MD for his comprehensive review of 148 the manuscript. 149 Table 1.

            "text": "-8 After the 42 1910 Flexner report, ophthalmology preserved a small but regular role in U.S. medical school 43 curricula. 9 Unfortunately, as undergraduate medical curricula expanded, ophthalmology saw a 44 decline in curricular time, which may be related to the fact that the Liaison Committee on 45 Medical Education (LCME) does not provide specific guidelines on ophthalmology training. 8,10 46 Several prior surveys have assessed the state of ophthalmology in medical education. In 47 1981, Kalina et al. reported a decrease in ophthalmology content throughout U.S. medical 48 schools, noting that didactic instruction had decreased from 25 hours in 1974 to 20 hours in 49 1979. 6 In more recent surveys, clinical rotations went from being a requirement at 60% of 50 schools in 2000, to 30% by 2004, and to 18% of Association of University Professors of 51 Ophthalmology (AUPO)-affiliated medical schools by 2014. 7,8,11 52 Given the marginalization of ophthalmology content within medical school and the 53 potential negative downstream effects of this change for the field, many ophthalmology 54 departments have created a dedicated Director of Medical Student Education (DMSE) position. 55 This individual acts as a leader for ophthalmology within the medical school and advocates for 56 medical students' learning of ophthalmology. In 2018, the AUPO's Medical Student Educators' 57 Council sought to take an updated snapshot of the state of ophthalmology education, with 58 attention to whether schools have a DMSE and how that position impacts curricula. 59 The state of medical student education in ophthalmology version of Shah et al.'s 2014 survey tool assessing curricular and extracurricular exposure to 62 ophthalmology in medical school(see table 1online).
