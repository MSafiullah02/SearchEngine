Human can get infected through close contact with a person has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing), spreads primarily through airborne droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, and transmission route represent in Figure 2 . Communication may also occur through object in the direct environment around the infectious people. [14] Therefore, spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can happens by direct contact with infectious person and indirect contact with objects in the immediate environment. Some evidence shows that it may also transmit through intestinal infection and are present in feces. [15] DRUG TARGET According to recently publish research, SARS-CoV attaches to the target cell with the help of spike protein host cell protein interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and MERS-CoV to dipeptidyl peptidase-4. [16] [17] [18] Later receptor identification, the virus genome with its nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm of the host cells. In addition, seven major targets such as membrane protein, envelope protein, spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, hemagglutinin esterase, and helicase [10] for designing of lead can considered. Moreover, 16 non-structural proteins may also consider for the development of CoV-specific drugs.",

However, a number of medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies, many of which are now being or will soon be studied in clinical trials. Supportive treatment may include administration of antipyretic and analgesic for fever and cough, maintenance of hydration and nutrition, and mechanical ventilation and even extra corporeal membrane oxygen as respiratory support may be needed. Renal replacement therapy may be needed in some instant and use of antibiotics and antifungal is necessary if coinfections are proven.
