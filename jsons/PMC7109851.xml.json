There are no reliable keys for identification of immature stages of Thysanoptera, so adults are required for morphological examination of them to species level. Moreover, because of insufficient phenotypic variation, the classical morphological taxonomy for many thripid species specifically preadult life stages has become practically useless (\nBrunner et al. 2004\n).\n",

Using the designed onion thrips primers, after a 30-min time interval, LAMP reaction products were clearly observed only when the onion thrips material was used as the template (\nFig. 8\n). Further checking at later time point (60 min) also confirmed that products were seen only in the onion thrips (not shown).

This identification approach could be used not only for the species presently studied but also, in the future, for other pest thrips species of agricultural, horticultural, and forestry interestand importance. This will, in turn, help in elucidation of the epidemiology of tospoviruses, their management, and serve as a potentially valuable tool in quarantine at ports of entry. Another merit of this approach is its requirement for relatively simple equipment for isothermal amplification and analysis of the target material. Our results also showed that by just grounding a single specimen, the sufficient amounts of material from the onion thrips to successfully LAMP detection was provided. Results of LAMP also can be observed using either gel electrophoresis or visual detection when calcein is incorporated. Lastly, a relatively short time is needed for completion of the entire process from the extraction of DNA to the detection of the presence of a particular species, so developing and using this technique for other species, especially pests of economic or quarantine importance, would be enormously precious in maintaining a pest-free status, especially in the areas subject to infestations of the quarantine pests where quick decisions about implementations of quarantine measures could be crucially important.",
