This may depend on the immune status of the patient and their ability to clear virus infection as well as the characteristics of the pathogen. The development of sensitive and specific methods for both the detection of viral nucleic acids and antiviral antibodies has greatly advanced our ability to make accurate diagnoses at different stages of the disease. Previously the extended periods needed for identification of viral etiologies; which greatly depended upon virus isolation techniques, meant that most viral diagnoses were of epidemiological value only [1\u20134].",

Since the development of antiviral drugs and treatment options available for viral infections, clinicians are encouraged to seek viral laboratory diagnosis that can provide clinically useful information in diagnosis and management of patients. This required the focus of laboratories to shift to providing better, faster diagnosis, which has driven the development of new approaches to monitor viral infections and to support antiviral treatment through: quantitative viral loads, antiviral susceptibility testing, viral genotyping and, point-of-care testing. Despite the massive impact that molecular diagnostics has had on viral diagnosis, significant strides have been made in antigen detection and serological tests, in development of \u201crapid tests\u201d, for the direct detection of viral antigen in clinical specimens and detection of antibodies in convalescent or chronic infections. Laboratory controlled molecular and serological tests continue to have the advantage of superior sensitivity, specificity and differential diagnostic options in a controlled environment [1\u20134]. With the increase in sensitivity, specificity and diversity of virological diagnostic assays available, the clinician should work in collaboration with the virology laboratory to maximize the diagnostic potential of an appropriate clinical specimen. Understanding the relevance of the diagnostic test requested for specific viruses, at different ages and interpretation of a positive test, remains key in the clinical management of a patient [1\u20134].",

Anticoagulants such as heparin may inhibit PCR and EDTA tubes are preferred for molecular testing. For serology, clotted blood may be collected in SST (serum separation tubes) tubes that allow separation of red blood cells and serum through centrifugation. Virus isolation may be preferred from whole blood (EDTA) or serum (clotted blood) depending on the virus. Swabs: Swabs with a Dacron or rayon tip are preferred to ensure cells are collected and should be placed in viral transport medium that will preserve labile viruses for viral isolation and RTPCR. Washes or aspirates such as nasopharyngeal aspirates and other fluids such as saliva and urine should be placed in viral transport medium, although CSF is usually preferred undiluted. Stool: Obtain at least 4 g of stool and place in a sterile container. Tissue: Place in a sterile container with small amount of viral transport medium, for viral diagnosis. Specimens other than clotted blood must be kept at 4 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) and transported on ice to retain viability of the viruses and keep nucleic acids intact [7].

Electron microscopy (EM) is the only method available for directly visualizing the virus, and therefore has many applications beyond being purely diagnostic. The visualization of viruses with EM involves negative staining of the clinical specimen. Negative staining of the clinical sample is a relatively straightforward; inexpensive technique that would represent a \u201ccatch all\u201d method of viral identification. EM could be particularly useful in identifying fastidious [87] or non-cultivable [88\u201390] virus in specimens, providing they have a high virus concentration with a sensitivity limit of approximately 106 viral particles per milliliter of specimen, making a negative result difficult to interpret [2]. While the sensitivity could be increased by ultracentrifugation or antibody-induced clumping, a further limitation is the lack of specificity, as EM can only identify up to the family level whereafter, other methods would have to be applied for a specific diagnosis [3]. Although the major advantage of EM is the speed with which a result could be obtained (30 min), the high cost of the instrument and specialized training and expertize needed, coupled with the lack of sensitivity and specificity, does not make this a viable option for routine diagnostics [4, 8].",

However, in the last 10 years molecular techniques have become routine. Virus isolation needs to remain an important part of viral diagnostics in order to maintain a source for analyzing, not only genotypic changes, but also phenotypic changes in virus populations for vaccine relevance and epidemiology. This allows identification of changes in antigenicity, pathogenicity and viral characteristics to update vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine, to match circulating strains [92]. Quality of the specimen, the time that it takes to reach the laboratory and transport under cold chain will determine the success of virus isolation. Detection of viruses in cell culture requires a considerable expertise and is performed by microscope examination, looking for degenerative morphological changes in the cell monolayer. This is called the cytopathic effect (CPE). Not all viruses grow in all cell types or produce CPE and further antigen or nucleic detection methods are required to correctly identify the specific virus involved. Clinical specimens are usually inoculated onto several cell lines to provide an optimum environment for a range of viruses (Table 6.2) [93].\n",

The enhanced detection rate may result from better contact between cells in the specimen and the cell culture, thus allowing for earlier and more extensive infection of the cell lines, as well as through the use of fluorescent-labeled (e.g. FITC) monoclonal antibodies directed to the viral antigen [93].

            "text": "The diversity, fastidious nature, short viremia periods of some pathogens that may cause the infection and lack of available diagnostic tests, can severely hamper the ability to identify etiologies to different clinical syndromes [81]. Several multiplex platforms have been developed either as a set of duplex assays, in-house and commercial [20, 104, 109] and multiplex systems that require specialized equipment to read and are now available for a range of syndromes [20, 104, 109]. The limiting factor has been sensitivity and most assays require PCR amplification before detecting products through a number of platforms. These include Mass-Tag PCR [110], microarray platforms [111], macro arrays [39], microbead based methods [20] and Taq-Man array cards [112\u2013115]. Currently TaqMan array cards are increasing in popularity due to the ease with which these can be adapted for specific purposes. These assays have application in diagnosis of single cases or as part of epidemiological studies to describe the etiologies of specific syndromes. Taq-Man array card (TAC; Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) assays have been developed and used with success for several syndromes such as respiratory disease [63], enteric disease [70] and neonatal sepsis [81]. Once developed, TaqMan array cards are stable at 4 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) for 2 years and can be shipped at ambient temperature [116]. The TAC assay is a 384-well microfluidic array which consists of identical arrays in eight individual microfluidic channels, each of which can be loaded with nucleic acid extract from a clinical specimen or positive control [63, 70, 81, 116, 117]. The individual channels consist of 48 wells, each of which contains singleplex qPCR reactions targeting a different pathogen. Thus eight specimens are assayed per TAC card, and can simultaneously detect up to 48 pathogens per specimen. This makes the TAC assay popular for the following reasons: (1) minimal specimen volume required; (2) reduction in cross contamination of specimens due to the closed system format; (3) the ability to tailor the panel of pathogens detected as required; (4) proven efficacy of this technology in pathogen detection for similar studies; (5) and simple to use format [63, 70, 81, 116, 117].",

However, most of the large scale methods described above are predominantly research based and used in epidemiological studies or in specialist laboratories, rather than routinely. Next generation sequencing methods, that make use of deep sequencing of all nucleic acids present in a sample, are currently mostly used for pathogen discovery or in specialist laboratories to detect outbreaks. In general amplification steps are still needed before this can be used on clinical specimens. In addition these techniques are too expensive to run on a large scale, in routine diagnostic laboratories. Even though these techniques are becoming more affordable they generate significant amounts of data that require both trained bioinformaticians to interpret the outputs and large computational systems. Nevertheless, development of automated systems for identifying viruses directly in clinical specimens, may in future make these techniques more accessible for routine diagnostics [118\u2013120].",

Recent literature has shown that specifically in the case of RV [27, 37, 38] that the virus was detected in asymptomatic as well as symptomatic patients. Due to the increased sensitivity of molecular assays it is possible to detect the presence of a virus at a low genome copy number, which may represent the pre- or post-syndromic phase of a viral infection, redefining the nature of viral disease and the clinical interpretation thereof [27, 38]. Interpretation of qualitative and quantitative PCR results as well as the application of the appropriate choice would require a close liaison with the virological laboratory.",

The development of new automated sequencing methods have enabled the study of the genetic basis of drug resistance and made the assessment of virus isolates, with reduced drug susceptibility, more accessible [8]. The use of sequence based methods for testing for antiviral resistance have also have become routine in viral diagnostics, especially for HIV [132, 135\u2013137] and HBV [138\u2013140]. The biggest drawback of this technique, other than the expense, is the downstream analysis of sequencing data that is generated.

Addition of a substrate to the enzyme linked antigen antibody complex results in a colour change which will induce a positive reaction. The assay can be adjusted for IgG or IgM through addition of the anti-human antibody. Antigen detection ELISA is performed by coating the solid phase with antibody to detect the antigen in the patient sera in order to reveal the detection antibody complex.",

Antigen is mixed with dilutions of antibody and the inhibition of CPE observed through inoculation on a tissue monolayer. The inhibition effect can either be read through observation of CPE, or through overlay of agar which allows plaque formation for plaque reduction neutralization assays (PRNT). Micro-neutralization assays can also be read through ELISA methods, which help to automate the process and reduce the test run time before infected cells can be detected. These techniques are labour intensive and not routinely done by diagnostic laboratories, but rather by reference or specialist laboratories [6, 142, 144].",

Due to cross reactivity and requirement for fresh red blood cells, it is less commonly employed in routine laboratories. The Western blot technique is still used for confirmation of HIV and HCV, and it is based on the principle of transferring specific viral proteins separated on a gel or blotting paper, followed by binding to patient serum and detection with an anti-human enzyme labeled antibody and substrate. It is very specific but sensitivity may vary. Antigen detection methods allow for the development of rapid antigen or antibody tests and allow for bedside diagnosis.

Methods that use multiplex microsphere-based suspension immuno assays (SIAs) for the simultaneous detection of IgG antibodies against a range of viruses, enables development of syndrome or application specific tests. An example would be a B19, CMV and T. gondii combination SIAs multiplex for rapid antibody screening during pregnancy [145]. These assays bind a number of antigens through antibody to a microsphere. They are then incubated with the patient sera before being visualized with a labeled anti-human IgM antibody. Similar tests have been described for arbovirus screening in the Northern hemisphere [146]. Multiplex formats, based on protein arrays, have also been developed to detect a range of viruses. For these assays the antigens are fixed to a solid phase microchip slide and tested against patient anti-serum and fluorescent labeled anti-human antibodies used for detection. The position on the chip identifies the pathogen involved. These arrays may be based on peptides synthesized from pathogen sequence [147] recombinant proteins, [148] or inactivated virus antigens [149]. These techniques are not yet widely available in routine diagnostic laboratories but developed in specialist and research laboratories. However, the automation possibilities will very likely improve their accessible in the future.",
