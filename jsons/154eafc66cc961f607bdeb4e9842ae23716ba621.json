            "text": "Italy is the country most seriously affected in the world by the coronavirus disease 2019 21 (COVID-19). As of 30 March 2020, our Government certified that 31% of the worldwide deaths 22 were from Italy (11,591 out of 36,500 cases) with the highest mortality rate (11.4%) compared the 23 global rate of 4.7%. Over the last weeks, several Italian hospitals adhered to international 24 experimental investigations on off-label drugs, such as tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor 25 monoclonal antibody and remdesivir, a nucleotide analog originally used against Ebola virus 26 disease, and artificial active immunization (vaccines creation). To our great surprise, in our country, 27 minimal medical and community attention has been riveted on passive immunity (immunoglobulin 28 therapy). In fact, while all bureaucratic efforts so far made in Italy failed to get unanimous 29 consensus and realization, the Chinese National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and 30 Disorders (set in Chongqing) and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health from Baltimore, USA, 31 both consider the passive antibody therapy a valid option for prevention and treatment of COVID-32 19 and recommend that institutions \"begin preparations as soon as possible. Time is of essence\". 1,2 33 Considering the long time for an effective vaccine and the important costs of biologic drugs, 34 antibody administration could represent an emergency, safe, less expensive, temporary but life-35 saving solution to be added to the continuous restrictive movement measures to combat 36 coronavirus. Cultural limitations can also impact the way for the cure. In the last years, paralleling 37 the development of social networks and globalization, Italy has met with a profound regression 38 characterized by a growing anti-vaccine community, lack of faith in science and misconceptions 39 about illnesses. Such blameworthy behaviors led to a violent resurgence of measles in 2017 40",
