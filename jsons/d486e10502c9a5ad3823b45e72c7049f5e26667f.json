            "text": "As with other organ systems, the vulnerability of the nervous system to infectious agents increases with aging. Several different infectious agents can cause neurodegenerative conditions, with prominent examples being human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) dementia and prion disorders. Such infections of the central nervous system (CNS) typically have a relatively long incubation period and a chronic progressive course, and are therefore increasing in frequency as more people live longer. Infectious agents may enter the central nervous system in infected migratory macrophages, by transcytosis across blood-brain barrier cells or by intraneuronal transfer from peripheral nerves. Synapses and lipid rafts are important sites at which infectious agents may enter neurons and/or exert their cytotoxic effects. Recent findings suggest the possibility that infectious agents may increase the risk of common age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke. While scenarios can be envisioned whereby viruses such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, herpes simplex and influenza promote damage to neurons during aging, there is no conclusive evidence for a major role of these pathogens in neurodegenerative disorders. In the case of stroke, blood vessels may be adversely affected by bacteria or viruses resulting in atherosclerosis.",

HIV-1 infects lymphocytes and impairs their immune function, thereby increasing the risk of several different opportunistic infections and certain types of cancers. Although effective treatments for AIDS, such as protease inhibitor cocktails have been developed, the resulting increase in survival of infected patients has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of individuals in which serious neurological consequences of HIV-1 infection arise (Gartner, 2000; McArthur et al., 2003) . Dementia is now common in treated AIDS patients and results from degeneration of synapses and neurons in brain regions such as the hippocampus and related limbic and cortical structures. HIV encephalitis also takes a toll on neurons in the basal ganglia-dysfunction and degeneration of neurons in the basal ganglia result in motor dysfunction and may also contribute to cognitive impairment, particularly in older patients infected with HIV (Berger and Arendt, 2000; Nath et al., 2000) .

The cells in which HIV-1 replicates in the CNS may include microglia/brain macrophages and neural stem cells (Haughey and Mattson, unpublished data) . HIV-1 does not infect neurons and it is therefore believed that neurons are damaged by HIV-1 proteins released from infected cells. Two such neurotoxic HIV-1 proteins have been identified, namely, the coat protein gp120 and the transcriptional regulator Tat, both of which have been shown to be present in soluble forms in the brains of HIV-1 dementia patients. Both gp120 and Tat can kill cultured neurons and can increase the vulnerability of neurons to excitotoxicity and apoptosis (Haughey and Mattson, 2002) . Patients with HIV dementia exhibit evidence of oxidative damage in their brains including increased amounts of peroxynitrite, 4-hydroxynonenal and protein carbonyls . gp120 and Tat have been shown to increase oxidative stress, and antioxidants can protect cells from the damaging effects of these proteins, suggesting an important role for oxidative damage in the pathogenesis of HIV dementia (Kruman et al., 1998) .

Lipid rafts are regions of the plasma membrane that have high levels of cholesterol and sphingomyelin, and receptors for many different cytokines and growth factors are concentrated in these membrane microdomains (Fig. 2) . Lipid rafts are believed to be portals through which many different types of viruses, including HIV-1 enter cells (Campbell et al., 2001) . In addition, lipid rafts may be regions of the cell at which gp120 and Tat exert their neurotoxic actions. Activation of cytokine receptors and oxidative stress can induce the production of ceramide from membrane sphingomyelin and ceramide, in turn can trigger a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. We discovered that levels of ceramide and sphingomyelin are significantly increased in brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HIV dementia . When cultured neurons were exposed to gp120 and Tat, levels of ceramide increased greatly. The ceramide precursor palmitoyl-CoA sensitized neurons to Tat and gp120 toxicities, and an inhibitor of ceramide production protected the neurons, demonstrating a critical role for ceramide in the neurotoxic actions of HIV-1. A better understanding of the roles of lipid rafts in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 dementia may lead to novel approaches for preventing and treating this disorder.",

Prion disorders affect primarily the CNS. Examples include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia in humans (Mastrianni and Roos, 2000; Giese and Kretzschmar, 2001; McKintosh et al., 2003) . These disorders are characterized by the intracellular accumulation of insoluble aggregates of prion protein, abnormal (scrapie) forms (PrPsc) of a normal protein called the cellular prion protein (PrPc). Because prion disorders can be transmitted from one individual to another it was initially assumed that these diseases were caused by a virus. However, intensive investigations failed to identify a virus and the emerging evidence led to the remarkable conclusion that the disease is transmitted by an abnormal form of the prion protein itself. PrPsc adopts a structure that fosters an interaction with PrPc that results in PrPc being converted to the pathogenic PrPsc form (Fig. 3) . In some cases the abnormal prion protein may result from a mutation in the PrPc gene, while in other cases the abnormal conformation of PrPsc may result from posttranslational modifications (Wiessmann, 2002) .",

It has been suggested that certain childhood infections may increase the risk of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, although the evidence is as yet meager (Martyn, 1997) . There are certainly a variety of viruses that infect cells in the nervous system and some of these viruses can be retained in neurons for long periods and even for the lifetime of an individual Examples include herpes simplex-1, Sindbis virus, measles and rabies (Kristensson et al., 1996; Griffin, 1998; Schneider-Schaulies et al., 2001; Mettenleiter, 2003 Normal forms of A\u2424 (soluble A\u2424) and prion proteins do not self aggregate, whereas in prion disorders and Alzheimer's disease the proteins generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acquire abnormal conformations. Genetic factors (e.g. mutations in the genes encoding the prion protein or A\u2424) and environmental factors (e.g. high caloric intake or folate deficiency) and the aging process may cause or promote formation of pathogenic forms of A\u2424 and PrPsc. During the process of peptide oligomer and fibril formation, A\u2424 and PrPsc induce membrane-associated oxidative stress and disrupt membrane ion transporter and channel functions resulting in synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. It has recently become evident that autoantibodies against abnormal conformations of A\u2424 and PrPsc can be generated by the immune systems in patients and in subjects immunized with A\u2424 or prion peptides. The autoantibodies may promote clearance of the endogenous pathogenic proteins from the brain and/or they may enhance the neurotoxicity of A\u2424 or PrPsc. transient infections might trigger neurodegenerative cascades when the infection occurs in aged individuals who may be at risk of the disease.",

Mutations in three different genes (the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1 and presenlin-2), and studies of cultured cells and transgenic mice expressing AD-linked APP and presenilin mutations have provided evidence that a critical event in AD is altered proteolytic processing of APP resulting in increased production of A\u2424. A\u2424 may damage neurons and render them vulnerable to excitotoxicity and apoptosis by inducing membrane lipid peroxidation and impairing the function of ion-motive ATPases, glucose and gluatmate transporters, and ion channels (Mattson et al., 1992; Mark et al., 1997; Guo et al., 1998 Guo et al., , 1999a (Fig. 3) . In addition to the degeneration of synapses and neurons that occurs in AD, damage to the oligodendrocytes that myelinate axons in the brain have been documented in mouse models of AD (Pak et al., 2003) .

Peripheral or central stimulation with lipopolysaccharide induces a transient increase in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, interleukin 1 beta and interleukin 6, and these cytokine changes are associated with microglial activation and altered processing of APP (Brugg et al., 1995; Lee et al., 2002) , suggesting roles of immune responses in neurodegenerative cascades in AD.

In a subsequent study by this the same investigators it was reported the C. pneumoniae is present in glial cells in areas of neuropathology in the brains of AD patients (Balin and Appelt, 2001) . The cells in the brains of AD patients that might be infected by C. pneumoniae include vascular endothelial cells and monocytes; these cells may play roles in the inflammatory processes and neuronal degeneration in AD (MacIntyre et al., 2003) .

Based upon data suggesting that peptic ulcer is more frequent in PD patients and that Helicobacter pylori can cause ulcers, a study was performed to determine whether H. pylori seropositivity was associated with PD (Charlett et al., 1999) . It was shown that siblings of PD patients had an increased probability of H. pylori seropositivity compared to control subjects. In one study there was an increased percentage of teachers and healthcare workers with PD in a large tertiary care movement disorders clinic suggesting the possibility that a high level of exposure to viral or other respiratory infections in these occupations might be a risk factor for PD (Tsui et al., 1999) . The possibility that viruses can induce PD is suggested by studies showing that certain viruses can induce PD-like pathology in rodents. For example, rats infected with Japanese encephalitis virus exhibited neuronal loss with gliosis which was confined mainly to the zona compacta of the substantia nigra (Ogata et al., 1997) .",

Cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Some rare cases of PD and ALS are caused by mutations. Three genes have been identified in which mutations cause early onset inherited PD (Parkin, \u2423-synuclein and DJ-1) and mutations in two genes (Cu/Zn-SOD and Alsin) are known to cause ALS. Insight into the molecular and cellular abnormalities that lead to the dysfunction and death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in PD and of motor neurons in ALS has come from studies of cultured cells and transgenic mice expressing the disease-causing human genes. In the case of PD, each of the mutations has been linked to abnormal ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated proteolysis, cellular oxidative and metabolic stress and triggering of apoptosis. In the case of ALS, Cu/Zn-SOD mutations cause oxidative stress and disrupt cellular calcium homeostasis. The aging process and environmental factors may perturb the same or similar regulatory systems that are adversely affected by genetic mutations. Synapses are particularly vulnerable to genetic, aging and environmental factors, and are sites where excitotoxic and apoptotic cascades that cause the death of the neurons are initiated. cases of ALS is unknown, but a few cases result from mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase. The pathogenic process in ALS involves increased oxidative stress and disruption of cellular calcium homeostasis which may trigger apoptosis (Pedersen et al., 1998 (Pedersen et al., , 2000 Kruman et al., 1999; Guo et al., 2000) (Fig. 4) . Recent findings suggest that abnormalities in lipid metabolism, involving increased levels of ceramides and cholesterol esters, also plays a role in the pathogenesis of ALS (Cutler et al., 2002) .",

However, it remains to be established whether C. pneumoniae induces/enhances atherosclerosis or if atherosclerotic plaques provide an environment in which C. pneumoniae accumulates. Similarly, it was reported that C. pneumoniae is present in symptomatic atherosclerotic carotids and that this is associated with increased serum antibodies, inflammation and apoptosis of T cells (Neureiter et al., 2003) . Other systemic bacterial and viral infections may promote stroke by enhancing atherosclerosis and by weakening cerebral blood vessels (Emsley and Tyrrell, 2002) . Acute infectious episodes may increase the risk of acute ischemic stroke in the elderly independently of other predisposing factors (Nencini et al., 2003) . Another infectious agent that may increase the risk of stroke is influenza which is suggested by studies showing that elderly individuals receiving the influenza vaccine have a significantly lower risk of stroke than do those not receiving the vaccine (Meyers, 2003) .",

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is caused by the infection of oligodendrocytes by JC papovirus and is characterized by slowly progressing dementia, visual problems and ataxia. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is caused by the measles virus and is characterized by behavioral changes mental and visual disturbances and ataxia; it is almost always fatal. The damage to oligodendrocytes may result from infection by the virus, exposure to viral proteins and/or an autoimmune response. Certain coronaviruses can also cause demyelination. For example, the mouse hepatitis virus can cause demyelination in the brains of non-human primates and human coronaviruses related to mouse hepatitis virus have been detected in brain tissue samples from patients with multiple sclerosis.",

It is clear that there is an autoimmune component to multiple sclerosis and it is possible that infectious agents may initiate damage to oligodendrocytes or otherwise elicit targeting of oligodendrocytes by the immune system. Because it is well-established that many different viruses can cause demyelination, it will be important to establish which specific viruses play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.",

Accordingly, synapses have been shown to vulnerable to dysfunction and degeneration in each of the infectious and age-related neurodegenerative disorders described above. Synapses are where excitotoxicity is initiated, a process in which glutamate receptors are overactivated under conditions of oxidative and metabolic stress, resulting in excessive calcium influx (Gilman and Mattson, 2002; Mattson, 2003) . Apoptosis may also be triggered at synapses and, indeed, biochemical cascades can be locally engaged in synapses in experimental models relevant to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders (Mattson et al., 1998a,b; Duan et al., 1999b; Glazner et al., 2000; Gilman et al., 2003) . Thus, synapses are vulnerable to the kinds of factors that are promoted by infectious agents. For example, the HIV-1 proteins gp120 and Tat induce oxidative stress and promote calcium influx through glutamate receptor channels and voltage-dependent channels which are concentrated in synapses (Haughey and Mattson, 2002) .",
