It cleaves the replicase polyproteins at 11 sites and is a promising drug target. Several groups of inhibitors have been identified through high-throughput screening and rational drug design. In addition to the pharmaceuti-cal applications, a mutant 3CL pro (T25G) with an expanded S1 space has been demonstrated to tolerate larger residues at P1 , facilitating the cleavage behind the recognition sequence. This review summarizes current developments in anti-SARS agents targeting 3CL pro and the application of the mutant protease as a tag-cleavage endopeptidase.",

            "text": "Respiratory viral infective diseases are renowned as a major threat to all ages worldwide, particularly children under 5 years of age [1] . Beginning in late 2002, a severe epidemic disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China and quickly spread to more than 30 countries and areas [2] , causing a significant impact on health and economy. SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) typically causes respiratory and enteric diseases, pneumonia, exacerbation of asthma, neurological symptoms, and myocarditis in humans [3] [4] [5] , with a mortality rate as high as nearly 10 % of those diagnosed [6] . SARS-CoV is a positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to a family of enveloped coronaviruses [5, 7] . The SARS-CoV genome contains five major open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the replicase polyprotein, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane glycoproteins (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). Extensive proteolytic processing of these nonstructural and structural polyproteins is a vital step for providing the functional proteins for SARS-CoV viral propagation, and such processing is mediated primarily by the nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), the main protease (M pro ) with a dimeric chymotrypsinfold, also known as 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) because of its analogy with the monomeric 3C protease (3C pro ) form picornavirus [8] [9] [10] . In contrast to the common serine proteases containing a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, SARS-CoV 3CL pro employs a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) in the catalytic site. This is similar to the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 3CL pro and the human coronavirus 229E 3CL pro (HCoV 229E) using Cys144 and His41 [8] . According to the previous studies on the substrate specificities and proteolytic sites, SARS-CoV 3CL pro utilizes the substrates with bulky hy-drophobic residues (mainly Leu or Ile), invariable glutamine residue, and small aliphatic residues (Ser, Ala, or Gly) at the P2, P1 and P1 positions, respectively [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In addition, secondary structural studies for substrates of SARS-CoV 3CL pro have revealed that substrates with more beta-sheet like structures tend to be cleaved more quickly [12] . The determination of the crystal structures for HCoV 229E 3CL pro and the inhibitor complex of TGEV 3CL pro also confirmed a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate binding sites for CoV 3CL pro [8] .",

The reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) experimental system was used to analyze cleaved products by a linear gradient of aceto-nitrile-containing trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and to screen inhibitors, but it is a time-consuming process. A fluorogenic substrate, Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans, with the fluorescence quenching pair (Edans-Dabcyl) has been developed to facilitate enzyme assay and inhibitor screening (Fig. 2) [14] . With this or other quenching pairs, such as 2-amino benzoyl-(Abz)-Tyr(NO 2 ) [15] , an intense increase of fluorescence was detectable upon the peptide cleavage by the protease due to the effect of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Accompanying a fluorescence plate reader, such a fluorogenic substrate can be applied to high-throughput inhibitor screening. In addition, fluorogenic peptides containing a SARS-CoV 3CL pro consensus cleavage sequence and Rhodamine 110 [(Ala-Arg-Leu-Gln-NH) 2 -Rhodamine] can also serve as substrates for the enzyme activity assay with high sensitivity (at low pM range) [16] .

The crystal structures of the 3CL pro from TGEV, HCoV 229E, and SARS-CoV  [8, 10, 17, 18] reveal a common feature for CoV 3CL pro with  two chymotrypsin-like b-domains (domain I & II) and one a-helical dimerization domain (domain III) which is absent from the picornavirus 3C pro and chymotrypsin [19] . In addition, deletion of the first four amino acids in the N terminus significantly increased the dimer dissociation constant (K D ) and accordingly decreased the protease activity [20] [21] . From analytic ultracentrifugation (AUC) analysis, sequential deletions of the first 3, 4, and 7 residues at the N terminus caused a 12-, 205-, and 1275-fold increase in dimer K D , respectively [20] , indicating the role of Arg4 in dimerization. Besides the N terminus, a cluster of conserved serine residues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) located adjacent to the active site, but away from the dimer interface of the protease initiates long-range cooperative interactions to modulate dimerization [22] . The mutation of Ser147 to Ala, which does not make any contact with the opposite subunit, totally abolished dimerization and enzyme activity. However, the measured K D values of the dimer varied [14, 20, 23, 24] , but a His-tag of the recombinant protein for NiNTA purification might interfere with the dimer formation [12] .",

The first crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro is complexed with a substrate-like hexapeptidyl chloromethylketone (Cbz-Val-Asn-Ser-Thr-Leu-Gln-CMK) inhibitor, revealing the structural features of this protease [10] . The protease forms a dimer with two protomers oriented almost at right angles to each other. The Cys-His catalytic dyad is located in an active site cleft between domains I and II, which adopt antiparallel b-barrel structures. Domain III, for mediating the tight dimerization, contains five a-helices arranged into a large antiparallel globular cluster. Another structure of the protease with C-terminal six amino acids from the neighboring protomer bound in the active site (product-bound form) reveals the detailed interactions of the protease with the P1 to P6 amino acids (QFTVGS) [18] . In this structure, two protomers (A and B) form a dimer, and the N terminus of protomer A is located close to the active site of protomer B. However, in the active site of protomer B, extra electron density originating from the six C-terminal amino acids of protomer B (the nearby protomer in the crystal packing) was found. The side chain of Gln (the last C-terminal residue of protomer B ) is~10 \u00c5 away from the side chain of Ser (the first N-terminal residue of protomer A), suggesting a positional shift after autocatalytic cleavage of the premature protease. This structure provides the necessary information for rational design of the active-site inhibitors [18] . The detailed interactions in the active site are as follows.

Wu et al. identified~50 active compounds by cell-based assay that block SARS-CoV replication, including two existing drugs, reserpine and aescin [28] . In the subsequent target verification, a compound named TL-3 that was developed as a transition-state analogue of the HIV protease (inhibition constant K i = 1.5 nM and 4 nM, against HIV protease and feline immunodeficiency virus protease, respectively) [29] was able to inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CL pro (K i = 0.6 \u03bcM; measured by the Edans-Dabcyl FRET assay) (1, Fig. 4 ). Lopinavir (one of the two components from the anti-AIDS drug Kaletra from Abbott) was shown to weakly inhibit the protease (K i = 15 \u03bcM), consistent with observed better clinical outcome for treating SARS patients with this drug in a Hong Kong Hospital [30] . Blanchard et al. had screened 50 000 druglike small molecules to find five novel SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors, MAC-5576, MAC-8120, MAC-13985, MAC-22272, and MAC-30731 (2-6, Fig. 4) , with IC 50 values of 0.5-7 \u03bcM measured using Abz-Tyr(NO 2 ) FRET assay [15] . Kao et al. screened 50 240 structurally diverse small molecules and found 2 compounds targeting the SARS-CoV 3CL pro [31] . One of the compounds, MP576 (7, Fig. 4) , a 3-quinolinecarboxylic acid, displayed inhibitory activity with a K i value of 2.5 \u03bcM in the HPLC-based cleavage assay and an EC 50 value (half maximal effective concentration) of 7 \u03bcM in the Vero cell-based SARS-CoV plaque reduction assay without apparent toxicity (CC 50 (half maximal cytostatic concentration) > 50 \u03bcM) [32] . The other compound, MP521 (8, Fig. 4 ), an imidazolidine, exhibited a K i value of 11 \u03bcM, an EC 50 value of 14 \u03bcM, and a CC 50 value > 50 \u03bcM. A library of 960 commercially available drugs and biologically active substances were screened by Hsu et al. using the cell-based assay to find three inhibitors, namely phenylmercuric acetate, thimerosal, and hexachlorophene (9-11, Fig. 4 ), which inhibited SARS protease activity according to the Edans-Dabcyl FRET assay [33] . The K i values of phenylmercuric acetate, thimerosal, and hexachlorophene were determined to be 0.7, 2.4, and 13.7 \u03bcM, respectively. Phenylmercuric acetate and thimerosal containing mercury are used as pharmaceutical excipients and more widely used as antimicrobial preservatives in parenteral and topical pharmaceutical formulations [34] . As shown below, other metal-containing compounds (such as zinc-containing compounds) were also identified to be the protease inhibitors. The hexachlorophene derivatives were further explored as SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors with similar inhibitory activity using the Abz-Dnp FRET assay by Liu et al. [35] . Chen et al. screened from a natural product library consisting of 720 compounds to obtain two compounds, tannic acid (IC 50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) = 3 \u03bcM) and 3-isotheaflavin-3-gallate (TF2B) (IC 50 = 7 \u03bcM), to be inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL pro with the Edans-Dabcyl assay [36] . These two large compounds (structures not shown) belong to a group of natural polyphenols in tea [37] . Also from a natural product library, an esculetin-4-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (MC8; 12, Fig. 4 ) with an IC 50 value of 46 \u03bcM against SARS-CoV 3CL pro was derived from the marine sponge Axinella corrugate [38] . The screening was performed by using a sensitive red-shifted internally quenched fluorogenic substrate for SARS-CoV 3CL pro , also based on the FRET between the CAL Fluor Red 610 and Black Hole Quencher-1 as a donor-acceptor pair. In the cell-based assays, MC8 is an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations (EC 50 = 112 \u03bcM; CC 50 > 800 \u03bcM).",

            "text": "Dragovich et al. synthesized a series of compounds targeting rhinovirus 3C protease for the possible treatment of the human common cold [39] . The best inhibitor is AG7088, a ketomethyl isostere of a tripeptide-conjugated ester (a peptide-like rhinovirus 3C protease inhibitor) with an EC 50 value of 0.013 \u03bcM in inhibiting the rhinovirus protease [40, 41] . Its P1 is a g-lactam moiety to mimic the P1 glutamine residue, and P1 is an a,b-unsaturated ester that acts as a Michael acceptor to inhibit the rhinovirus 3C pro by forming a covalent bond with the active site Cys residue. To improve cell membrane permeability, the P2 phenylalanine residue was replaced with a methylene isostere bearing a 4-fluorophenyl substituent. Although it was a potent inhibitor of the rhinovirus 3C pro , it was not approved for clinical use due to a lack of obvious advantage in treating patients with common cold. He et al. from Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., applied for a US patent entitled ''Inhibitors of SARS 3C like protease'' for the application of the AG7088-like compounds with Michael acceptor to inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Two formulae were proposed as potential SARS protease inhibitors (13 and 14, Fig. 5 ) without giving their activity data [42] . Kania et al. from Pfizer, Inc., developed a series of compounds with the same structural features of \u03b3-lactam at P1 and a isobutyl group at P2 to inhibit SARS-CoV 3CL pro , as described in their world patent entitled ''Anticoronaviral compounds and compositions, their pharmaceutical uses and materials for their synthesis'' [43] . These compounds were shown to provide protection for the Vero cells from HCoV 229E and SARS-CoV infection in a viability assay. Although having the same structural features, some of these compounds were inactive (EC 50 > 100 \u03bcM) against the SARS-CoV and some showed inhibitory activity. The best compound of this series displayed 0.053 \u03bcM for compound 19, Fig. 5 ), based on the HPLC assay [45] . The inhibitor exhibited potent activities in suppressing replication of SARS-CoV (4.7 log viral titer reduction at 5 \u03bcM concentration, EC 50 = 0.6 \u03bcM and cytotoxicity CC 50 > 20 \u03bcM) and HCoV 229E (5.2 log viral titer reduction at 1.25 \u03bcM concentration, EC 50 = 0.14 \u03bcM). The tight binding between TG-0205221 and the SARS-CoV 3CL pro is through a covalent bond, hydrogen bonds, and unprecedented hydrophobic interactions as evidenced by the crystal structure of the corresponding complex [46] . Shie et al. found that the replacement of the g-lactam moiety in AG7088 with a phenylalanine side chain resulted in a more potent SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitor [47] . As shown in Fig. 5 , the best inhibitor (20) of this series has a K i value of 0.5 \u03bcM measured by the Edans-Dabcyl FRET assay. The compound also showed potent activity (EC 50 = 0.2 \u03bcM) against SARS-CoV replication by blocking the synthesis of the viral spike protein without apparent toxicity (CC 50 > 200 \u03bcM) in cell-based assays [47] . From the computer modelling, the phenylalanine side chain at P1 and P2 positions may be shifted by one position to occupy S2 and S3 sites as the a,b-unsaturated Michael acceptor is not covalently bound with the Cys145. According to the product-bound crystal structure of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro [18] , S2 is a hydrophobic pocket to hold the hydrophobic residue, and the P3 side chain is exposed to the solvent.",

The inhibition activity was measured by the continuous colorimetric assay using the colorimetric substrate Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA.

As mercury-containing compounds may pose therapeutic hazards to a patient if orally taken, a series of zinccontaining compounds and metal ions were evaluated for SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibition [33] . The most potent inhibitor found was 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc, a competitive inhibitor with a K i value of 0.17 \u03bcM (29, Fig. 6 ) with more inhibitory activity than just Zn 2+ (K i = 1.1 \u03bcM). Zn 2+ was previously found to be tetrahedrally coordinated by three Cys sulfurs and one His nitrogen of the 2A protease from a common cold virus, which is responsible for the shut-off of host-cell protein synthesis [60] . Zinc-containing compounds, such as zinc acetate, are added as a supplement to the drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease [61] , indicating the safety of the ion for human use. Zinc salts such as zincum gluconicum (Zenullose) may be effective in treating the common cold, a disease caused by rhi-noviruses, without knowledge of the molecular target [62] .

In fact, this Ser cluster is conserved in all known CoV proteases and may represent a common target of wide-spectrum CoV protease inhibitors. Based on the known reactivity of boronic acid compounds with the hydroxyl group in Ser residues, the inhibitory potency of bifunctional boronic acid compounds was evaluated. A chemical scaffold containing two phenyl boronic groups attached to a central aromatic ring by ester linkages were tested. This compound has a K i value of 0.04 \u03bcM based on an Edans-Dabcyl FRET assay. Different variations of the compound were prepared, including several isomers with replacement of the central aromatic ring with shorter ester linkage and different functionalities at the phenyl boronic rings. The highest improvement in affinity was observed when the ester linkage between the aromatic rings was replaced with an amide group, thereby resulting in nanomolar inhibition constants. The inhibitors display a mixed competitive pattern and bind to both free enzyme and enzyme substrate complex. This may be due to the large substrate used in the kinetic measurements. These compounds inhibited the enzyme in a reversible manner. Freire et al. provided a series of organic boron-containing compounds (compound 31 as a representative and 31A, 31B, and 31C as examples in Fig. 6 ), compositions thereof and methods of using such compounds and compositions for inhibiting CoV proteases and for treating infections [66] . The invention provides a method of inhibiting CoV proteases, treating infections caused by CoV and detecting CoV, particularly CoV proteases that have one or more serine or threonine residue(s) at or near its active site and proteases of SARS-associated CoV. Such methods comprise contacting the testing sample obtained from a patient with boron-containing compound 31 [66] that have been: i) tethered to an appropriate surface such that protease coming into contact and being bound to the tethered compound can be detected; ii) labelled by fluorescent, radioactive, or other markers that allow identification of CoV protease bound to the compound; or iii) that by any other means can be used to detect the presence of CoV protease.",

            "text": "In addition to serving as a promising target in anti-SARS chemotherapy, SARS-CoV 3CL pro possesses potential as a tag-cleavage endopeptidase. As analogous to picornaviruses 3C proteases, 3CL pro has substrate specificity in cleaving the amide bond between P1-Gln and a small amino acid such as Ser, Ala, or Gly at P1 [78, 79] . According to the structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro [10, 18] , this small P1 residue is near Thr25, which likely limits the substrate specificity. Since the recombinant SARS-CoV 3CL pro can undergo auto-processing [18, 80] , a modification on the S1 might tolerate a large amino acid at P1 position. In fact, SARS-CoV 3CL pro with T25G mutation expands the S1 site and, thus, is able to cleave peptides with larger amino acids such as Met (the starting amino acid of most native proteins) at P1 [81] (Fig. 8a) . Indeed, compared with the k cat of 1.6 + 0.2 min -1 and the K m of 76.6 + 3.5 \u03bcM for the wild-type, the T25G mutant displays the k cat of 16.2 + 0.5 min -1 and the K m of 18.6 + 2.4 \u03bcM (43.5-fold higher k cat /K m ) against the SAVLQ MGFRK substrate. Moreover, vectors that contain the nucleotides encoding the T25G recognition site AVLQ M between the tags and the N-terminal Met of the target proteins have been constructed and expressed by the prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. In these vectors, PstI (CTGCAG) is chosen as a 5 cloning site, since its sequence overlaps with the nucleotide sequence (GCGGTGCTGCAG) encoding the protease recognition site (Fig. 8B) . Identical 5 -PstI/3 -XhoI cloning sites in these vectors can be used to allow sticky-end DNA fragments of the target genes generated by PCR [82] vectors simultaneously (parallel cloning method) [83, 84] . These engineered vectors and the T25G mutant can be assembled as a kit for the maximal production of soluble and functional proteins with authentic sequences (see the patent entitled ''Protein expression system involving mutated severe respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 3C-like protease'' by Liang et al. [85] ).",

            "text": "Since viral protease inhibitors are remarkably effective at blocking the viral replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects, inhibiting 3CL pro proteolysis is a convincing strategy against SARS-CoV. In this review article, the effective inhibitors against SARS-CoV 3CL pro are summarized and the methodology for detecting the protease activity and inhibitor screening are discussed. Most of the peptidomimetic inhibitors of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro are designed based on its substrate specificity of P1-Gln, but some have Phe to replace the Gln moiety. For covalent inhibitors, the electrophilic structural features, such as Michael acceptor (a,b-unsaturated ester), fluoromethyl ketone, aziridine, epoxide, and etacrynic acid, are built in to react with the activesite Cys residue. The metal-containing compounds also target the Cys145 residue. Other compounds that have been suggested to bind to the active site of SARS protease based on computer modelling are potential inhibitors. All the inhibitors for SARS-CoV 3CL pro may also be used in inhibiting other viral proteases due to some degree of structural similarity of their active sites. In fact, some of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors are derived from previously identified rhinovirus 3C pro inhibitors such as AG7088 (now called Rupintrivir). Rupintrivir is a potent inhibitor of 3C pro based on in vitro and in vivo studies. Its analogues modified based on the structural differences between 3C pro and 3CL pro represent promising leads for anti-CoVagents. Several classes of 3CL pro inhibitors can also inhibit picornaviral 3C pro [86] . Structural studies have revealed that 3C pro is a monomer, whereas 3CL pro is a dimeric protein which has an extra third domain for dimer formation, although their active sites are superimposed very well [87] . Moreover, 3C pro has a more open but shallow S2 site, as well as a smaller S3 site, which account for different inhibitory specificity, as concluded from the structural comparison of the same inhibitor in the 3C pro and 3CL pro active sites [86] . Moreover, these inhibitors could possibly serve as new drug leads for other viral diseases such as those caused by rhinovirus, HCoV 229E, enterovirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and infectious bronchitis virus. Particularly, the recently emerged SARS-like coronavirus, human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC), also called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has a 3CL pro structurally similar to SARS-CoV 3CL pro and the protease can be inhibited by N3 (18, Fig. 5 ) [88] , which is a Rupintrivir analogue inhibiting SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Moreover, CE-5, a small-molecule inhibitor of 3CL pro of SARS-CoV [89] also inhibits the activity of MERS-CoV 3CL pro [90] . Therefore, the information discussed in the present review helps to ultimately develop drugs against infectious CoVs and picornaviruses, which should be continuously pursued.",

            "text": "A mutant (T25G) of SARS 3CL pro can recognize Ala-Val-Leu-Gln Met and cleave the fusion proteins efficiently. As a result, it can serve as a novel endopeptidase for tag cleavage when the fusion proteins expressed in E. coli and yeast Pichia contain the AVLQ sequence immediately before their own N-terminal Met residue. Moreover, the mutant protease also showed similar cleavage efficiency to the commonly used FXa in cleaving the tag under the same condition. Other vectors with different expression systems including baculovirus-infected insect cells, mammalian cells, and cell-free system, could also be constructed to contain the same protease recognition site. The common 5 -PstI/3 -XhoI restriction sites can be used for parallel cloning of the sticky-end PCR product of a target gene into these vectors. These engineered vectors and the mutant protease can be assembled as a kit for parallel expression of a target gene in multiple hosts simultaneously to screen for the most optimal condition to produce a soluble and functional protein with maximal yield. The fusion protein can then be purified with the affinity column against the tag (e.g., NiNTA for His-tag) and the tag can be removed by T25G 3CL pro to yield the recombinant protein with authentic sequence.

A general formula is given inFig. 5(16). Rao et al. applied for a patent covering a series of AG7088 analogues with the common structure of compound 17(Fig. 5) as inhibitors of SARS 3CL pro[44]. Using a continuous fluorometric assay with the fluorogenic substrate MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)Lys-NH 2 , an effective compound (18,Fig. 5) in this series inhibited not only the 3CL pro of SARS-CoV (K i = 9 \u03bcM, k inact (rate of enzyme inactivation) = 0.0031 s -1 ), but also the protease of HCoV 229E, TGEV, feline infectious peritonitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and infectious bronchitis virus[45]. This compound exhibited an EC 50 value of 4.3 \u03bcM against mouse hepatitis virus on murine delay brain tumour cells in a plaque-reduction assay.
