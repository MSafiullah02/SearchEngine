Very many more laboratory and clinical studies have investigated the role, function, and support of the lung, heart, brain, and kidney in critical illness than have studied the liver. Nevertheless, in the time of the Greek scholars, there was already acknowledgement of the role of the liver in non-hepatic diseases such as systemic sepsis, and an understanding that such involvement confers a poorer prognosis -hence the inclusion of the wisdom of Hippocrates in this compilation of classic papers. In the review article by Matuschak and Rinaldo, the reasons why liver dysfunction is associated with a poorer outcome in critical illness are explored, and the concept of the liver being a 'driving force' in multiple organ dysfunction is developed. In addition, jaundice without significant liver dysfunction is associated with left ventricular dysfunction, at least in the dog model developed by Professor Otto Better and his colleagues in Israel. This observation is relevant to the progressive resistance to inotropic and vasopressor agents in jaundiced critically ill patients.",

With the advent of liver transplantation as the principle treatment for patients with fulminant hepatic failure, these patients are almost always managed in ICUs servicing liver transplant units. Consequently, it is extremely important that intensive care practitioners in non-liver units understand the need to refer patients to transplant units, as well as the role of transplantation in acute liver failure and its indications. The seminal paper by O'Grady and the group from King's College Hospital, London, develops criteria for liver transplantation in acute liver failure. That a successful outcome is possible after emergency liver transplantation for acute liver failure is shown in the early series of cases reported from the French group from Clichy and Villejuif. When transplantation is not indicated, or while awaiting a donor, the principal treatment is supportive. The paper by Harrison and co-workers, again from the King's Liver Unit, investigates the effects of n-acetylcysteine in patients with acute liver failure, and the findings of this study have resulted in widespread use of this agent in this setting. Currently, there is still no safe, effective means of artificial liver support for patients awaiting transplantation or liver regeneration. The case report from Saunders and co-workers from Cape Town, South Africa, describes an early attempt to develop such support.",

It is argued that the normal liver plays a pivotal role in aspects of host defence that are crucial to the protection of the lung and other organs in systemic sepsis. The authors note that the fixed hepatic macrophages, or Kupffer cells, constitute nearly 90% of the body's reticuloendothelial cell mass. They further note that these cells are the major mechanism for clearance of systemic endotoxin and bacterial products. The strategic location of the liver, immediately downstream from the large gastrointestinal reservoir of bacteria and bacterial products, normally constitutes an effective first line in host control of systemic endotoxemia and bacteremia.",

Moreover, the authors describe the activation of Kupffer cells by the phagocytic burst, resulting in the release of an array of inflammatory mediators that are 'exported' systemically, and result in acute pathophysiological reactions in distant organs. These inflammatory mediators also have effects on adjoining hepatic parenchymal cells. Evidence is presented that the resulting hepatocyte damage may result in decreased clearance of some of these mediators, resulting in heightened and prolonged effects, and consequent amplification of multiple organ damage. Furthermore, these inflammatory mediators -particularly interleukin-1 -induce changes in hepatic protein synthesis, characterized principally by the 'acute phase response'.",

            "text": "The \"jaundiced heart\": a possible explanation for postoperative shock in obstructive jaundice Abstract Patients with obstructive jaundice are susceptible to postoperative shock and kidney failure. The cause of these potentially fatal complications has not been fully clarified. The present study was designed to assess the role of myocardial dysfunction in the hemodynamic disturbance of obstructive jaundice. We studied the effect of isolated cholemia on left ventricular performance in five conscious dogs, before and 2 weeks after choledochocaval anastomosis, by using measurements of systolic time intervals (STIs) and maximal dp/dt. Mean left ventricular ejection time (LVET) decreased after cholemia from 159 +/-2.8 msec to 139 +/-2.6 msec (p < 0.005), while mean preejection period (PEP) and mean PEP/LVET were increased from 41 +/-8.5 msec to 87 +/-14 msec (p < 0.05) and from 0.39 +/-0.06 to 0.62 +/-0.1 (p < 0.01), respectively. During cholemia, STIs were unchanged after intravenous administration of ouabain, whereas in the control period, there was shortening of mean PEP from 71 +/-8.8 msec to 58 +/-7.6 msec (p < 0.05), and of Q-S2 from 257 +/-12 msec to 235 +/-14 msec (p < 0.005) in response to ouabain. Maximal dp/dt decreased after choledochocaval anastomosis from 4543 +/-593 mmHg/ sec to 3666 +/-648 mmHg/sec (p < 0.025). We conclude that cholemia in the dog is clearly associated with impaired left ventricular performance. The present data also support a previously published in vitro study from our laboratory showing that cholemia blunts the myocardial contractile response to sympathomimetic agents. The cardiodepressor effect of cholemia may explain the increased tendency of patients with obstructive jaundice to postoperative shock and renal failure.",

This paper describes the clinical setting, hemodynamic characteristics, and outcome of ischemic hepatitis, and consequently makes a major contribution to the body of knowledge on the subject. Ischemic hepatitis is not a rare hepatic disorder, but rather it is a circulatory disorder, and therefore of great relevance to intensive care medicine. Abstract A novel quantitative liver function test is described which is based on monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) formation after lidocaine bolus injection. Following the administration of small single doses of lidocaine hydrochloride (1 mg/kg), monoethylglycinexylidide serum concentration-time curves were determined by a novel, highly sensitive fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) in healthy volunteers, liver donors, and patients with liver cirrhosis. The FPIA allowed rapid and reliable monoethylglycinexylidide determinations in serum and urine (between-days coefficient of variation: < 10.3%, recovery: 80-113%). Monoethylglycinexylidide concentrations measured by FPIA in 32 serum samples from patients correlated well with those determined by HPLC. The monoethylglycinexylidide concentration in serum determined 15 minute after a lidocaine bolus injection proved to be a highly sensitive and specific indicator of hepatic dysfunction. Average monoethylglycinexylidide concentrations in serum obtained 15 minute after lidocaine injection were substantially lower in patients with liver cirrhosis than in healthy volunteers. The average monoethylglycinexylidide concentrations in serum were also substantially lower in liver donors with ballooning or fatty changes of hepatocytes than in donors without relevant alterations of liver histology. By means of monoethylglycinexylidide formation in the liver donors, primary function of the transplanted liver was correctly predicted in 32/37 cases, and initial non-function in 4/6 cases.",

Although criteria for transplantation, and aspects of the surgical technique and postoperative immunosuppression have developed over the intervening years, orthotopic liver transplantation has not been superceded, and should be considered as an option in all patients with acute liver failure. Abstract BACKGROUND. When administered early after an overdose of acetaminophen, intravenous acetylcysteine prevents hepatic necrosis by replenishing reduced stores of glutathione. How acetylcysteine improves the survival of patients with established liver damage induced by acetaminophen, however, is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether the beneficial effect of acetylcysteine under such circumstances could be due to enhancement of oxygen delivery and consumption. METHODS. We studied the effect of acetylcysteine on systemic hemodynamics and oxygen transport in 12 patients with acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure, and 8 patients with acute liver failure from other causes. The acetylcysteine was given in a dose of 150 mg/kg in 250 ml of 5% dextrose over a period of 15 minutes, and then in a dose of 50 mg/kg in 500 ml of 5% dextrose over a period of 4 hours; measurements were made before treatment began, and after 30 minutes of the regimen. RESULTS. In the patients with acetaminophen-induced liver failure, the infusion of acetylcysteine resulted in an increase in mean oxygen delivery from 856 to 975 ml/min/m 2 (p = 0.0036), due to an increase in the cardiac index from 5.6 to 6.7 mm/m 2 (p = 0.0021). Mean arterial pressure rose from 88 to 95 mmHg (p = 0.0054), despite a decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1296 to 1113 dyn.sec.cm -5 per square meter (p = 0.027). There was an increase in oxygen consumption from 127 to 184 ml/min/m 2 (p = 0.0007) associated with an increase in the oxygen-extraction ratio from 16 to 21 percent (p = 0.022). The effects in the patients with acute liver failure from other causes were similar. CONCLUSIONS. The increase in oxygen delivery and consumption in response to acetylcysteine may account for its beneficial effect on survival in patients with fulminant hepatic failure induced by acetaminophen.",

However, more than 30 years later, there remains a need to develop a safe and effective artificial liver for use in patients with acute liver failure. Abstract BACKGROUND: In patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, renal function frequently becomes impaired. This impairment is probably related to a reduction in effective arterial blood volume, and is associated with a high mortality rate. We conducted a study to determine whether plasma volume expansion with intravenous albumin prevents renal impairment and reduces mortality in these patients. METHODS: We randomly assigned 126 patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to treatment with intravenous cefotaxime (63 patients), or cefotaxime and intravenous albumin (63 patients). Cefotaxime was given daily in dosages that varied according to the serum creatinine level, and albumin was given at a dose of 1.5 kg of body weight at the time of diagnosis, followed by 1 kg on day 3. Renal impairment was defined as nonreversible deterioration of renal function during hospitalization. RESULTS: The infection resolved in 59 patients in the cefotaxime group (94%) and 62 in the cefotaxime-plus-albumin group (98%) (p = 0.36). Renal impairment developed in 21 patients in the cefotaxime group (33%), and 6 in the cefotaxime-plus-albumin group (10%) (p = 0.002). Eighteen patients (29%) in the cefotaxime group died in the hospital, as compared with 6 (10 percent) in the cefotaxime-plus-albumin group (p = 0.01); at three months, the mortality rates were 41 percent (a total of 26 deaths), and 22% (a total of 14 deaths), respectively (p = 0.03). Patients treated with cefotaxime had higher levels of plasma renin activity than those treated with cefotaxime and albumin; patients with renal impairment had the highest values. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, treatment with intravenous albumin in addition to an antibiotic reduces the incidence of renal impairment and death, in comparison with treatment with an antibiotic alone.",

Her jaundice initially resolved after 6 weeks, but recurred soon after and was accompanied by a flapping tremor. Her neurological state deteriorated markedly to grade IV encephalopathy. She was treated with a regimen of daily exchange transfusion for 6 days, but despite some apparent improvement related to these procedures, this was not sustained. She duly became apneic, and after an unsuccessful seventh exchange transfusion, she underwent cross-circulation with a baboon. The baboon had been especially prepared by washing out the blood volume with lactate solution under hypothermia on bypass, and then replacing the blood volume with human blood compatible with the patient. After about 12 hours, spontaneous ventilation returned, and there was an improvement in conscious state and the treatment was terminated. She remained neurologically impaired for two further days, and then improved markedly to become fully conscious with no abnormal neurological signs. Her improvement persisted until publication of the case report.",

Indeed, it should be excluded in every cirrhotic patient admitted to the ICU. Consequently, advances in its treatment are very relevant to the ICU clinician. Furthermore, despite the current uncertainty as to the place of albumin therapy in critically ill patients, it seems clear that it confers a survival advantage to patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.",
