            "text": "We recently reported that current smokers and those with COPD had higher airway epithelial cell expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) viral entry receptor [1]. We thus read with great interest the work of Russo et al. [2] which proposes a mechanism for this finding, namely that this upregulation is mediated by nicotine exposure specifically through the \u03b17 subtype of nicotine acetylcholine receptors (\u03b17-nAChR). While exposure to increasing concentrations of nicotine caused epithelial cells to increase ACE-2 levels, subsequent gene silencing of \u03b17-nAChR appeared to significantly dampen this response. A secondary transcriptome sequencing analysis of our cohort (consisting of 42 subjects who underwent bronchoscopy for epithelial cell brushings [1]) reveals evidence in support of this hypothesis. We found that airway epithelial cell expression of CHRNA7, encoding \u03b17-nAChR, was significantly correlated with the expression of ACE2 (fig. 1, Pearson r=0.54, p=2.31\u00d710\u22128). There was significantly higher CHRNA7 expression in those with COPD (2.75\u00b10.73 versus 2.14\u00b10.43 in those without COPD, p=1.47\u00d710\u22124), with a trend towards higher expression in current smokers compared to former and never smokers (2.86\u00b10.92 in current smokers, 2.35\u00b10.57 in former smokers, and 2.27\u00b10.45 in never smokers, p=6.16\u00d710\u22122). CHRNA7 was also negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted (Pearson r=\u22120.37, p=2.83\u00d710\u22124). Interestingly, CHRNA7 was positively if weakly correlated with body mass index (Pearson r=0.14, p=6.31\u00d710\u22123), raising the intriguing possibility that nicotine receptor mediation of ACE-2 may also be related to why obese individuals have made up a considerable proportion of COVID-19 cases [3].\n",

As an example, \u03b17-nAChR antagonists for the purpose of smoking cessation have long been proposed [7] and the idea of potentially repurposing these compounds for a pandemic with few therapeutic options currently available is certainly appealing. Whether \u03b17-nAChR-selective antagonists such as methyllycaconitine [8] and \u03b1-conotoxin [9] can meaningfully alter ACE-2 expression to prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into the airway epithelium seems the next logical investigation in our furious pursuit for better therapeutics.",
