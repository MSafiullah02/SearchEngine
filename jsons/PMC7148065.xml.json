The users monitor a specific legal topic by querying the news stream with that topic periodically and all the retrieved results are tagged with a relevance judgment for later usage. Given this context, we group the data into equal intervals corresponding to the report creation times and evaluate the retrieved results per interval. The initial ranked lists were generated by using the Boolean query created by the users, and ranked in a chronological order. We apply the alternative ranking approaches as a re-ranking task. In total the dataset consists 206 queries and 60,512 labelled news articles, among which 2,872 (21%) are marked as relevant. By grouping the searches into the equal interval and removing sessions with no relevant articles, we obtain 1,774 search sessions (i.e. query-results pairs). The average number of relevant articles per-session varies from 1.5 to 4.4 articles depending on the queries. We randomly split the dataset into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. The same setup holds for both traditional retrieval models as well as for L2R approaches. We use the validation set to tune the models\u2019 parameters.",

We see that all retrieval models significantly outperform the Boolean search results for all measures. This suggests that without further effort in terms of feature engineering and model fitting, traditional models already improve the ranking quality by capturing topical relevance. Further, we see that different fields may be best for one model but not for the other, suggesting that their combination in a L2R approach may be beneficial.

Moreover, compared to explicit feature engineering, fine tuning BERT seems to have captured the user information needs in an implicit manner. This is encouraging as it not only learns the complex relevance criteria more accurately, but also provides more flexibility as the model can be fine tuned for use cases with different criteria without dedicated feature engineering.",

On the other hand, we should also be aware that as the model complexity increases, there is decreasing model explainability and user controllability\u2014the properties of Boolean search appreciated by professional users [16, 24].

However, fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (BERT) shows strong improvements over both traditional models and L2R models, with the advantage of not requiring dedicated feature encoding.

(ii) what are the limitations of pre-trained LMs to capture fine-grained information needs? and; (iii) how does the above depend on the number and quality of the relevance judgements, particularly in the case of niche retrieval tasks?",
