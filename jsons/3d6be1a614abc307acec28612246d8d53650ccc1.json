Because of the time constraints associated with the development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease. The research articles or grey literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from 4 databases and 1 search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about 6 drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and 3 traditional Chinese medicines Injection and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) were extracted. All of the drug treatment options depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas traditional Chinese medicine has a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway, such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This review provides an insight to experimental validation of drugs and alternative medicine used for the treatment and control of COVID-19. virus, drug repurposing, medication, treatment, traditional Chinese medicine, alternative and complementary medicine were used in the literature search through a three-level search strategy based on standardized descriptors defined by the Medical Subject Headings algorithm. A secondary search was based on screening of the reference list of all the relevant studies identified in the direct search. The entire potentially relevant studies were evaluated after title screening to exclude irrelevant information. Only studies that reported the repurposing of drugs and TCMs for COVID-19 and contained information about the structure of the chemical constituents, in vivo or in vitro studies, case reports, treatment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and molecular mechanisms were extracted and assessed.",

The International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses has officially named the disease \"COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019)\" and the virus SARS-CoV-2 (WHOa, 2020; Gorbalenya et al., 2020) . The new corona virus has rapidly spread among humans all over the world and has led to hundreds of thousands of cases within a few months. As a result, on 11 th March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, which is defined as \"worldwide spread of a new disease\". As of 26 th March 2020, more than 462,684 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, with the total number of deaths reaching 20,834 (4.5%) people (WHOb, 2020) . The worldwide distribution of COVID-19 cases as of 26 th March 2020, 10:00 (CET) is shown in Figure 1 . CoVs are single-stranded RNA viruses that look like a crown under a microscope (coronam is the Latin word for crown) and contain spike glycoproteins on the envelope. The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae of the Coronaviridae family (order Nidovirales) is classified into four genera of CoVs: alphaCoV, betaCoV, deltaCoV, and gammaCoV. SARS-CoV-2 is categorized as a betaCoV. It has an elliptic or round and often pleomorphic form, with a diameter of 60-140 nm. Like other betaCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and .

Furthermore, the safety of the developed vaccines is unknown because laboratory tests are being conducted in parallel to clinical trial phase 1 owing to the emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The unknown efficacy and safety of the vaccines used might cause disease enhancement, by which vaccinated subjects might develop an even more severe form of disease than the subjects that have not been vaccinated, which has been shown in studies of SARS vaccines, in which vaccinated ferrets developed damaging inflammation in their livers after they were infected with the virus (Weingartl et al., 2004) .",

Prior to the discovery and synthesis of lopinavir, ritonavir was used for the treatment of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections through reversible inhibition of the HIV proteases by blocking access to the proteases' active site, thus preventing the processing of the HIV Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins (Kempf, 2007) . This results in the formation of immature HIV particles that are not infectious. However, the extremely high mutation rate of HIV-1 in vivo (Cuevas, Geller, Garijo, L\u00f3pez-Aldeguer, & Sanju\u00e1n, 2015) has given rise to a strain of HIV-1 that is resistant to ritonavir. The rise of ritonavir-resistant HIV strains has led the development of more effective drugs for combating HIV infections, one of which is lopinavir. Lopinavir, being a protease inhibitor, functions similarly to ritonavir in that it reversibly binds to the HIV protease's active site and prevents the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins from being processed (Rock, Hengel, Rock, Wienkers, & Kunze, 2014) . Compared with ritonavir, a lower amount of lopinavir is required to achieve EC50 (17 nM versus 25 nM) (Lv, Chu, & Wang, 2015) . Although it is more effective (in terms of concentration required to achieve EC50), in vitro experiments with human liver microsomes have revealed that lopinavir undergoes oxidative metabolism by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (Van Waterschoot et al., 2010; Rock, Hengel, Rock, Wienkers, & Kunze, 2014) , thus reducing the bioavailability of lopinavir. To combat this, lopinavir is administered together with ritonavir, which can inhibit P450 3A4 enzyme activity.",

However, a binding analysis showed that half of the lopinavir was left outside of the catalytic site and one of ritonavir's benzene side chains might be too long to perfectly fit the substrate binding pocket. This would lead to ritonavir and lopinavir having poor efficacy, and this is reflected in weak in vitro activity against SARS-CoV (Zhang & Yap, 2004) . Another study suggests that both lopinavir and ritonavir have no effect on SARS-CoV replication, with nelfinavir being the only inhibitor that has an effect on SARS-CoV replication (Yamamoto et al., 2004) . Despite not having any effect on SARS-CoV replication, lopinavir does have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, with one study suggesting lopinavir has a synergistic effect when used with ribavirin (Chu et. al., 2004) . A study conducted on lopinavir's and ritonavir's effectiveness against MERS-CoV showed that although lopinavir and ritonavir have antiviral activity against MERS-CoV, their effectiveness is lower than interferon beta and remdesivir (Sheahan et. al., 2020) .",

However, other studies have reported positive results against HCoV-OC43 and EBOV when treated with chloroquine (Keyaerts, 2009; Madrid, 2013) . The contradict results in animal studies could be owing to the range of doses tested, whereby higher doses could be necessary to produce consistently positive results. However, this may lead to a poor outcome owing to an increase in drug related toxicity. Furthermore, chloroquine may be more effective as a prophylactic treatment owing to its activity during the early stages of a viral cycle, during which it establishes residence in the host through replication of SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation period in patients in the initial stage of the disease, which is a mild condition (Wan et al., 2020) .",

However, this TCM was not included in the guideline launched by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for prevention of COVID-19 which have been updated to version 7 and known as Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 version 4 report in China for prevention of COVID-19, as reported by China News Liu, 2020) . This is because the findings were limited to an initial laboratory phase and insufficient data was available to confirm that this TCM can suppress SARS-CoV-2. A clinical trial is still essential to verify its efficacy. As a result, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Wuhan Tongji Hospital have initiated a clinical trial on Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye (Yue, 2020) . Although there is still insufficient scientific evidence that this TCM can be used to control COVID-19, it still widely used and the Beijing Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine claims that it is one of the TCM that can be used to prevent COVID-19. Because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from the coronaviruses family, the strategies used for the treatment of SARS could be relevant for COVID-19 . Furthermore, the medicinal plants that in this TCM are known for their antiviral function and have been utilized to alleviate influenza and restrain SARS coronavirus.",

In contrast to the other TCMs mentioned above, the other two TCM formulas (Xiao Cai Hu Tang and Wu Ling San) function differently and did not exhibit function against acute airway obstruction. Xiao Cai Hu Tang (XCHT) is known as a TCM for liver treatment, particularly chronic hepatitis B. This TCM modulates STAT3 expression and indirectly suppresses the hepatitis B virus according to western blot analyses and real time PCR results (Chen et al., 2017) . The synergistic effect of this TCM for the treatment of pneumonia is unknown and requires full elucidation in the future. Wu Ling San (WLS) has been used for the treatment of impairments of the regulation of body fluid homeostasis in China, Japan, and Korea (Ahn et al., 2012) . WLS might affect the signal transduction pathway such as NF-kB, MAPKs and HO-1 to demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects like MXSGT to treat pneumonia or respiratory diseases in lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages (Oh et al., 2014) .",

Oseltamivir is eliminated from the body in the urine, and in vitro studies have shown that both oseltamivir phosphate and oseltamivir carboxylate is not susceptible to metabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzymes (Hoffman-La Roche Inc, 2009). Although it can be used to prevent influenza infections, consumption of oseltamivir is not a substitute for influenza vaccination (Hoffman-La Roche Inc, 2009). The common side effects of oseltamivir are nausea and vomiting, ranging from mild to moderate severity. These side effects can be mitigated by consuming oseltamivir with food (Genentech, Inc., 2011).",

Reduced levels of viral RNA and extended survival time was observed in EBOV-infected nonhuman primates, whereas 83% of the MARV-infected nonhuman primates survived upon treatment with favipiravir (Bixler, 2018). In 2014, a proof-of-concept trial of favipiravir in patients with EVD in Guinea was initiated, in which patients received favipiravir along with standardized care (Sissoko et al, 2016). Data on the safety and effectiveness of favipiravir in reducing mortality and viral load were collected. The study reported a lower fatality rate among patients with low to moderate viral load compared with the control group. The findings were supported by FPV trials in Sierra Leone and different parts of Guinea (Bai et al., 2016; Kerber 2019). To study the effect of favipiravir on COVID-19, favipiravir was approved for the treatment of COVID-19 disease on February 15, 2020 in China. A pilot study of a nonrandomized control trial at The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen reported significantly better treatment effects in terms of disease progression and viral clearance compared with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment (Cai et al., 2020). A different randomized clinical trial was conducted at three hospitals in China (Zhongnam Hospital of Wuhan University, Leishenshan Hospital, The Third People's Hospital of Hubei Province) to compare the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and arbidol to treat COVID-19 patients (Chang et al., 2020). The trial recruited a total of 240 patients and followed up from Feb 20, 2020 to Mar 12, 2020.

These chemical constituents, chlorogenic acid, baicalin, and forsythiaside A, share a common characteristic of being antiviral against influenza; however, their antiviral activity against coronaviruses requires further investigation for further clarification. Traditional Chinese Medicine recommended by Chinese CDC according to severity of clinical symptoms Based on the Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 Version 5 by the National Health Commission (NHC) of the People's Republic of China on 8 February 2020, three TCMs have been used depending on the severity of the condition of COVID-19 and symptom differentiation  Chinese Centre for disease control and prevention, 2020).",
