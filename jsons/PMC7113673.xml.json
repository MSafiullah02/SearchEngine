The first known patient was a 45-year old man in the city of Foshan, who developed fever and respiratory symptoms on November 16, 2002, transmitting infection to his wife and three other family members. The second index case was a restaurant chef in Shenzhen who became ill on 10 December, returned to his home in Heyuan and transmitted infection to health care workers (HCWs) in the local hospital, including the physician who accompanied him in an ambulance to Guangzhou provincial hospital. This scenario of the emergence of clusters of cases of severe respiratory disease among family members and hospital workers, each cluster apparently going extinct after a few rounds of secondary or tertiary transmission, was played out repeatedly in subsequent weeks in a number of municipalities in Guangdong province. The index cases of many of these early case clusters were food handlers or chefs working in restaurants where a variety of exotic and game animals were slaughtered on the premises (Xu et al., 2004a). During subsequent weeks, the outbreak became self-sustaining, with large clusters of transmission in hospitals spilling back into the community (Table 1\n).",

He was to transmit infection to 19 relatives and more than 50 hospital staff. On 21 February, one of the doctors infected as part of this extended hospital outbreak traveled to Hong Kong, where he stayed one night in a hotel and was hospitalised the next day. During his stay, he transmitted infection to 16 other hotel guests and one visitor, who traveled on to their destinations, seeding outbreaks of this disease in Vietnam, Singapore, Toronto and in Hong Kong. On 12 March, following the outbreaks in mainland China, Hong Kong and Vietnam, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert about an unusual pneumonia which appeared to cause outbreaks of disease in hospitals. This led to the recognition and reporting of additional case clusters in Toronto and Singapore, prompting the WHO to issue an Emergency Travel Advisory on 15 March, providing an early case definition and naming the disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (WHO Western Pacific Region, 2006). A chronology of events during and after the SARS outbreak is provided in Table 1.",

Fortunately, it had an unusual feature that permitted the success of basic public health measures in controlling person-to-person transmission: the \u201cviral load\u201d in upper respiratory tract secretions was low in the first 5 days of illness, then increased progressively, peaking early in the second week (see Cheng et al., in this series). As a result, transmission was less common in the first days of illness, providing an opportunity for case detection and isolation to interrupt transmission. Patients were most infectious when they were hospitalised, contributing to transmission in hospitals, especially those in more developed settings where invasive and potentially aerosol-generating interventions such as bronchoscopy were more likely to be carried out.",

It has been speculated that the enhanced stability of the SARS-CoV at lower temperatures and lower humidity, especially in air-conditioned environments, may help explain the explosive outbreaks that occurred in some regions, compared to others (Chan et al., 2011). However, as awareness grew, patients began to be identified and hospitalized earlier in the illness (Leung et al., 2004), and as effective infection control modalities were better implemented, it became possible to interrupt transmission in the community and in hospitals. Thus, on 5 July 2003, it was possible for the WHO to announce that \u201call known chains of human-to-human transmission of the SARS virus now appear to be broken\u201d. Such an outcome could hardly have been imagined in the dark days of March\u2013April, when, for example, an unprecedented cluster of around 300 cases emerged over a few days in the Amoy Gardens housing estate in Hong Kong.",

Epidemiological investigations had found that the index patients of the initial case clusters in November\u2013December 2002 were food handlers or restaurant workers, especially those exposed to exotic wild-game animals, regarded as a winter delicacy in southern China. The increasing affluence of the past decade had led to this trade becoming highly organised and commercialised, with hundreds of diverse exotic wild-life being housed in large central markets. Investigation of these \u201cwet markets\u201d led to the detection of a virus closely related to SARS-CoV in a range of small mammalian species, such as Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata), raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and others. People working in these markets had a high prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV, even though they gave no history of having had SARS, while people working in other areas of the markets, such as vegetable stalls, or people in the community did not (Guan et al., 2003). This identified wild-game animal markets as the interface which facilitated the maintenance and amplification of SARS-CoV precursor viruses, allowing repeated exposure of the human population and leading to inter-species transmission events.",

Phylogenetically, these re-emergent viruses were more closely related to viruses found at that time in game-animal markets than to those that caused the SARS epidemic the year before (Liang et al., 2004). This confirmed the contention that wet markets were the source of initial human infection and led to their closure, very likely pre-empting a re-emergence of SARS. Further work established that wild-caught palm civets showed no evidence of SARS-CoV infection, suggesting that they were intermediate, amplifying hosts, rather than the true reservoir. Novel coronaviruses, including some closely related to SARS-CoV, have been identified in bats, including insectivorous Rhinolophid bats (Li et al., 2005b, Lau et al., 2005; see Drexler et al., in this series). Subsequent work has identified the virus\u2013receptor interactions and receptor restrictions that permit or restrict interspecies transmission events of SARS-CoV-like viruses (Li et al., 2005a; see the review by F. Li, in this series).",

A preliminary, uncontrolled study from Toronto suggested that treatment with a combination of interferon-\u03b1 and corticosteroids was superior to corticosteroids alone (Loutfy et al., 2003). In SARS-CoV-infected cell culture, interferon-\u03b2 had much superior effects over interferon-\u03b1 (Cinatl et al., 2003b).

The antiviral effect of these compounds was also observed in cell culture. As the coronavirus genome does not code for an aspartic protease related to the HIV protease, Wu et al. (2004) tested the potency of lopinavir against the isolated SARS-CoV main protease (also called the 3C-like protease, 3CLpro), which is a cysteine protease, and found an IC50 of around 50 \u03bcM. This low potency is probably not sufficient to explain the beneficial effects of lopinavir/ritonavir in the clinical treatment of SARS patients. While ritonavir is known to boost the immune system, this cannot explain the observed activity in cell culture. An alternative explanation could be the anti-apoptotic activity of these HIV protease inhibitors (Maturrese et al., 2002). More information on the proposed binding mode of lopinavir to the SARS-CoV main protease and on attempts to improve its inhibitory potency will be presented in the review of this molecular target in this series by Zhang et al.",

(2003), making more rational approaches to antiviral drug discovery possible. For example, Luo et al. (2004) noticed some sequence similarities between the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein and the capsid protein (CA) of HIV. The latter binds to cyclophilin A (CypA), a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase of the host cell, which is incorporated into the HIV particle (Gamble et al., 1996). Accordingly, Luo et al. (2004) reasoned that the N protein of SARS-CoV may also bind to CypA, and could indeed determine the Kd value to 60\u2013160 nM. This interaction was blocked by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of CypA, which however is used as an immunosuppressive drug. Through virtual screening techniques that employed the modelled SARS-CoV N-CypA complex as a target, Luo et al. were able to identify some other inhibitors of this interaction, but most of them showed some degree of cell toxicity. Chen et al. (2005) confirmed the interaction between CypA and the N protein and even provided evidence for an incorporation of CypA into the virion, similar to what had been shown previously for HIV-1.",

Consequently, they tested CsA for antiviral effects against a large range of coronaviruses and found it to be a \u201cpan-coronavirus inhibitor\u201d (Pfefferle et al., 2011; see also de Wilde et al., 2011). However, as CsA also displayed antiviral activity against the \u03b3-coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which lacks Nsp1, it is possible that the mechanism originally proposed by Luo et al. (2004) may contribute to CsA\u2019s anticoronaviral activity (Ma-Lauer et al., 2012).

By the end of March 2003, when the SARS-CoV was discovered as the etiological agent causing the disease, only one crystal structure of a coronavirus protein was available, that of the main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) of the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Anand et al., 2002). However, in mid-May 2003, at the peak of the SARS outbreak in Beijing, the same group published the first structure of a synthetic inhibitor, a peptidyl methyl ketone, bound to the TGEV Mpro, as well as the structure of a second coronavirus Mpro, that of human coronavirus 229E, and a homology model of the SARS-CoV enzyme based on these structures (Anand et al., 2003). Furthermore, these authors suggested that AG7088 (rupintrivir), a Michael-acceptor-type inhibitor of the 3C protease of human rhinovirus, should be a good starting point for anti-SARS drug design. A little later, this compound itself was shown to have little activity against the virus (Shie et al., 2005), but derivatives of rupintrivir turned out to be quite active in virus-infected cell culture (Shie et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2005). These studies were facilitated by the determination of the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV main protease itself in June, 2003 (Yang et al., 2003). Since then, many inhibitors have been designed and synthesized that target the coronavirus Mpro, but few of them have undergone systematic toxicity and other preclinical studies, so that these compounds are not yet available for clinical trials in case of a recurrence of SARS (or for treatment of patients infected with the new human coronavirus, MERS-CoV, see below). The numerous studies aimed at designing inhibitors of coronavirus main proteases will be summarized by Zhang et al. in this series.",

The spike glycoprotein (S) protrudes from the surface of the viral particle (hence the name \u201ccoronavirus\u201d) and is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion. In late 2003, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the receptor of SARS-CoV on the surface of human cells (Li et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2004). The structure of the complex between the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2 was determined by Li et al. (2005a), who will review this and subsequent work in this series. Proteolytic processing of the S protein, a prerequisite for membrane fusion, will be reviewed by Simmons, P\u00f6hlmann, and colleagues. Inhibitors of the host-cell proteases involved have also been shown to prevent cell entry of SARS-CoV (see, e.g., Adedeji et al., 2013). Peptides corresponding to the heptad repeats of the trimeric S protein have been demonstrated to inhibit the fusion of the viral envelope with the host-cell membrane (e.g., Sainz et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2009).",

In recent years, significant progress has been made in unravelling the structures of these DMVs, as will be reviewed by Snijder and colleagues in this series. After assembly of the RTC, a nested set of (sub)genomic mRNAs is synthesized and subsequently translated into the structural and accessory proteins (Sawicki et al., 2007, Pasternak et al., 2006). Finally, the structural proteins assemble into progeny virions, along with the newly synthesized genomic RNA. After budding through membranes of the intermediate ER-to-Golgi compartment (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994), the mature virions egress from the host cell via exocytosis.",

(on Mpro). Significant progress has also been made over the past 10 years in elucidating the structures of other Nsps, in the hope of learning something about their function. Table 2\nlists the structures known to date. This effort has been made possible through several structural proteomics projects (Bartlam et al., 2005, Bartlam et al., 2007, Canard et al., 2008, Hilgenfeld et al., 2008). Overall, this approach has been quite successful, although for those proteins (mostly encoded by ORF1a) for which we know the 3D structures, the functions are still not quite clear in many cases (Nsp1, Nsp3 domains other than the PLpro, Nsp9, Nsp10, also partly Nsp7+8). In contrast, for several proteins (mostly encoded by ORF1b) for which we know the functions, little structural information is available. The most painful lack of structural information concerns Nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), and Nsp13, the helicase, both of which are obvious drug targets. Progress in characterizing Nsp3 domains other than the PLpro will be summarized by Lei et al., on Nsp7\u2013Nsp10 by Xiao et al., and on Nsp12\u2013Nsp16 by Canard and colleagues in articles in this series.",

It is thought that this event was responsible for the increased efficiency of human-to-human transmission that surfaced about the same time, triggering the epidemic (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004, Oostra et al., 2007). Structural information for SARS-CoV accessory proteins is still very scarce (see Table 2), partly due to the fact that many of these gene products are membrane proteins.

One legacy of the outbreak was the formulation of the international Health Regulations (IHR) in 2005 (http://www.who.int/ihr/en/) and their acceptance by the World Health Assembly in 2007. The IHR require countries to report unusual and unexplained outbreaks of infectious disease and to develop the public health capacity to detect and respond to such diseases, when and where they occur (in this series, see the review by P. Gully). SARS and other contemporary zoonotic threats, such as H5N1 avian influenza, have highlighted the need for collaboration among those responsible for human and animal health, and the environment. This led to the formalization of the concept of \u201cOne Health\u201d, which fosters collaborative effects of multiple disciplines to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. The relevant international organizations, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the WHO now have a formal agreement and framework within which they can coordinate activities to assess risks at the animal/human/ecosystem interface (FAO\u2013OIE\u2013WHO Collaboration; see http://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/tripartite_concept_note_hanoi_042011_en.pdf (accessed 7th August 2013)).

In 2012, we saw another novel coronavirus emerge in the Middle East (Zaki et al., 2012). The novel Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus is a beta-coronavirus, like the SARS-CoV but it belongs to lineage c rather than b (see Drexler et al. in this series). It causes severe pneumonia as well as renal failure, with a high fatality rate. Index cases have originated in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, while travel-associated cases have been diagnosed in France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and the UK.

Secondary transmission has been reported in hospitals, but in one such event in France, the disease did not appear to be highly transmissible to healthy HCWs; instead, it targeted patients who were immunocompromised (Mailles et al., 2013). The largest cluster of cases was reported from a health facility in Al-Ahsa in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia where transmission to other patients and family members, as well as a few HCWs, has occurred (Assiri et al., 2013). In contrast to SARS, relatively few HCWs have been affected so far. Although viruses closely related to the MERS-CoV have been detected in Pipistrellus bats found in Europe and Africa, a more epidemiologically plausible zoonotic source and phylogenetically proximate virus remain to be identified (see Drexler et al., in this series; Annan et al., 2013). Very recently, high neutralizing-antibody titers to MERS-CoV have been detected in dromedary camels in Oman and in Egypt, suggesting that they may be an intermediate transmitter of the virus (Reusken et al., 2013; Perera et al., 2013). These events are uncannily reminiscent of the emergence of SARS in late 2002. Sero-epidemiological studies are needed to define the full extent of secondary transmission of MERS-CoV and whether the infection is more widespread in the community.",

However, it should also be noted that after 2005\u20132006, it became difficult to obtain funding for research on SARS-CoV in many countries, especially for efforts to discover new antiviral therapies. Similarly, there was no incentive to further develop SARS-CoV vaccines, in the absence of an overt threat to human health. Funding agencies and peer reviewers were probably short-sighted in this respect, but many virologists also failed to take seriously the threat of the re-emergence of SARS or of a SARS-like virus.",

            "text": "Even though many inhibitors of the SARS-CoV main protease have been designed on the basis of crystal structures (see the review by Zhang et al., in this series), few have been tested in SARS-CoV-infected cell culture, let alone in an animal model. For the other prime drug targets among the viral nonstructural proteins, the RdRp (Nsp12) and the helicase (Nsp13), the situation is even more discouraging, because it is difficult to obtain these enzymes in an active form, and numerous attempts to crystallize them have failed. Thus, the frustrating conclusion after ten years of excellent basic research on SARS-CoV is that we are still left with the therapies that showed only uncertain effects in the treatment of patients in 2003, i.e. interferon-\u03b1 and lopinavir/ritonavir, which seem to be all that can be offered for the specific antiviral treatment of MERS patients. Very recently, it was shown that in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques, the course of disease was much milder upon treatment with a combination of interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin (Falzarano et al., 2013b). After the largely negative experiences in treating SARS patients, corticosteroids are no longer a treatment option. There may be some hope that non-immunosuppressive derivatives of cyclosporin A, such as DEBIO-025, can be used for therapy, but such compounds remain to be tested in virus-infected cell culture. Also, a peptidic ketoamide designed on the basis of the crystal structure of the Mpro of the bat coronavirus HKU4, which is highly similar to the corresponding enzyme from MERS-CoV, appears to be promising, with good antiviral activity against the MERS-CoV (Lin et al., in preparation), and so do some \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters (Ma et al., in preparation). However, these compounds are only now in safety studies in animals, and it will take a long time until they can be used in the clinic. If the current MERS-CoV outbreak is over by then, there is a danger that both funding and enthusiasm for developing these and other compounds will once again wane, and we will be in the same \u201cdrug-less\u201d situation when the next zoonotic transmission of a coronavirus into the human population will occur.",

A number of vaccine strategies were developed and tested in laboratory animals, including recombinant vectored vaccines expressing SARS-CoV S protein, DNA vaccines, inactivated whole-virus vaccines and recombinant-protein vaccines (for a review, see Gillim-Ross and Subbarao, 2006). These studies showed that the S protein is crucial for eliciting effective protective antibody responses, and that there is a good correlation between neutralizing- antibody titers and protection from challenge in animal models. The N protein can induce antigen-specific T-cell-mediated immune responses. An inactivated whole-virus vaccine was tested in phase-1 clinical trials in China. Human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV were shown to be protective for passive prophylaxis and immunotherapy in laboratory animals (Gillim-Ross and Subbarao, 2006). However, in the absence of a re-emergence of SARS, there was little incentive to pursue these initiatives, and recent years have not seen progress towards a credible SARS vaccine.",
