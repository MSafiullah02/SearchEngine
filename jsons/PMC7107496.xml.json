When activated by viral nucleic acids, TLRs and RLRs will activate the TBK1\u2013IRF3 axis, leading to type I interferon (IFN) expression and secretion (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006; He et al., 2017). Then, the released IFNs induce hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK\u2013STAT) signaling pathway to clear the invaded virus (Platanias, 2005; Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006; Shu et al., 2015). Among them, the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, the myxovirus resistance gene Mx, the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetases, and interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) have been shown to disrupt viral infection in various manners (Garcia et al., 2006; Rafique et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013). More than 350 genes have been characterized as ISGs. However, their roles and mechanisms in fighting against multiple distinct classes of viruses remain largely unexplored.",

            "text": "Purinergic signaling and purinergic receptors are important in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Purinergic signaling was first reported in 1929 and, after several decades of study, many of the biologic effects of ATP, UTP, ADP, UDP, and adenosine signaling were discovered (Eltzschig et al., 2012; Idzko et al., 2014). In tissue injury or pathogen infection, nucleotides can be released from stressed cells as a danger signal, alerting the cells by interaction with purinergic receptors in an autocrine or paracrine manner (Cho et al., 2014). Nineteen different purinergic receptor subtypes have been identified, which can be classified into P1 and P2 receptors. Four P1 receptor subtypes can be activated by adenosine. P2 receptors can be further divided into P2Y receptors (P2YRs) and P2X receptors (P2XRs) based on their structures and distinct signal-transduction mechanisms. P2YRs are G-protein-coupled receptors for ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP, while P2XRs are nucleotide-gated ion channels and can be activated by ATP (Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998; Junger, 2011; Idzko et al., 2014). Many studies revealed crucial roles for P2 receptors during inflammatory and infectious diseases. For example, ATP-triggered P2X7 activation is crucial for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the subsequent release of interleukin-1\u03b2 (Di Virgilio et al., 2017). ATP/UTP receptor P2Y2 signaling has been identified as a \u2018find-me\u2019 signal to recruit motile phagocytes, thereby promoting clearance of apoptotic cells or bacteria (Elliott et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010). Our previous study demonstrated that the ADP-mediated P2Y12/P2Y13 signal pathway protects the host defense against bacterial infection via ERK signaling (Zhang et al., 2018). However, whether ADP- (or its receptors-) mediated immune regulation is also involved in viral infection remains unclear.",

In this study, we demonstrate that P2Y13, as an ISG, and its ligand, ADP, is released from infected cells as a danger signal during viral infection, which restricts the replication of both DNA and RNA viruses. ADP/P2Y13-mediated protection against viral infection operates by suppressing the expression of exchange protein activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC1), which is an alternative key intracellular sensor for cAMP. Therefore, we demonstrated that ADP/P2Y13 restricts viral infection through suppressing the cAMP/EPAC1 signaling pathway, which has potential therapeutic significance in the prevention and control of viral diseases.",

As shown in Figure 1A, the RNA expression of P2Y13 was upregulated obviously by all three IFNs. The protein level of P2Y13 also upregulated by IFN-\u03b2 (Figure 1B). Besides, when blocked IFN receptor (IFNAR) with the anti-IFNAR antibody, the upregulated expression of P2Y13 was decreased (Figure 1C), suggesting that P2Y13 upregulation is dependent on signals downstream of IFN. The JAK/STAT pathway is crucial for IFN-induced cellular antiviral signaling. To determine whether IFN-induced P2Y13 upregulation via the JAK/STAT1 pathway, we pretreated mouse peritoneal macrophages (PEMs) with ruxolitinib (a JAK1 inhibitor) and fludarabine (a STAT1 inhibitor) and found that IFN\u03b2-induced P2Y13 expression was blocked by both inhibitors (Figure 1D and E). Inhibition of STAT1 also reduced VSV-induced P2Y13 expression (Figure 1F). In addition, knockout of TLR3 to block TLR3-mediated activation of IFN also suppressed poly(I:C)-induced P2Y13 expression (Figure 1G). Taken together, these data demonstrated that P2Y13 has the typical characteristics of ISGs.",

To investigate the potential role of ADP as a danger signal in viral infection, the release of endogenous ADP in viral-infected cells was measured. As shown in Figure 2A and B, extracellular ADP in VSV-infected cell supernatant was clearly increased in a time-dependent manner. Besides, NDV-infected BMDMs and HSV-1-infected HEK293T cells also release large amounts of ADP (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S1A), suggesting ADP can be released as a danger signal during viral infection. To investigate the biological significance of ADP, we pretreated the cells with ADP before VSV infection. To our surprise, the RNA replication of VSV in ADP-treated RAW264.7 cells was reduced significantly in a time- (Figure 2D) and concentration- (Figure 2E) dependent manner. Accordingly, the viability of VSV-infected RAW 264.7 cells was increased dramatically by ADP in a concentration-dependent manner while have little influence on uninfected cells (Figure 2F and Supplementary Figure S1B), indicating that extracellular ADP protects cells from VSV infection. To confirm whether ADP has broad-spectrum antiviral activities, RAW264.7 cells and BMDMs were pretreated with ADP before VSV, NDV, and HSV-1 infection. As shown in Figure 2G\u2013J and Supplementary Figure S1C, the RNA expression of VSV, NDV, HSV-1 and the titers of VSV were all strikingly decreased by ADP. Similar results were observed in HEK293T cells, where cell cytopathic effects were induced by VSV and HSV-1, as determined using a crystal violet staining assay (Supplementary Figure S1D and E). We further infected HEK293T and Hela cells with VSV-GFP and MLV-GFP and found that the number of GFP-positive cells was decreased in ADP-treated cells, indicating that VSV-GFP and MLV-GFP were restricted by ADP (Supplementary Figure S1F\u2013I). To rule out the possibility that ADP degradation products mediate the suppression of viral replication, we treated cells with non-hydrolyzable ADP analog ADP-\u03b2-s. As shown in Supplementary Figure S1J, ADP-\u03b2-s has a similar role as ADP in restricting VSV replication. Taken together, our data suggested that extracellular ADP has broad-spectrum antiviral activities, which have great potential in protecting hosts from a viral infection.",

As shown in Figure 3A, only the expression of P2Y13 was increased significantly, whereas the expression of P2Y1 and P2Y12 was little changed in VSV-infected RAW264.7 cells. Similar data were observed in poly(I:C)-treated BMDMs (Figure 3B). We then used MRS 2179 and MRS 2211 to inhibit P2Y1 and P2Y13, respectively, to verify whether P2Y1 and P2Y13 contributed to ADP-mediated antiviral activities. We found that ADP-mediated antiviral activities were little influenced by MRS 2179 but significantly decreased by MRS 2211 as shown in Figure 3C\u2013F, and both of MRS 2179 and MRS 2211 have little influence on cell viability (Supplementary Figure S2A and B). Consistently, when infected wild-type, P2Y1-, P2Y12-, and P2Y13-deficient BMDMs with VSV, the VSV RNA replication was increased only in P2Y13-deficient BMDMs, not in P2Y1- or P2Y12-knockout BMDMs (Figure 3G). Meanwhile, ADP-reduced VSV RNA replication was compensated in P2Y13-deficient PEMs (Figure 3H). Furthermore, the protein expression of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) was significantly increased in P2Y13-deficient PEMs and overexpression of P2Y13 in HeLa cells significantly repressed VSV replication (Figure 3I; Supplementary Figure S2C and D). Taken together, our data suggested that P2Y13 deficiency facilitates VSV infection and ADP-mediated antiviral activities primarily through the P2Y13 receptor.",

P2Y13-deficient mice were more susceptible to VSV infection. On the other hand, if we intraperitoneally injected mice with ADP to activate P2Y13, VSV distributions in the liver, spleen, and lung were all significantly decreased (Figure 4B). Similar data were observed during HSV-1 infection (Figure 4C). Besides, more VSV RNA replicates were found in P2Y13-deficient mice liver (Figure 4D). As a neurotropic virus, VSV can invade the nervous system and is transmitted directly via the transcutaneous or transmucosal route. Thus, to mimic the natural infection of VSV, we treated mice with ADP through nasal dripping and then intranasally infected with VSV. As shown in Figure 4E and F, VSV RNA replication and VSV-G in olfactory bulbs were both significantly reduced by ADP. Taken together, these data demonstrated that ADP/P2Y13 plays an important role in protecting mice from VSV infection, suggesting that ADP/P2Y13 has potential as a novel antiviral drug target.",

However, when we treated BMDMs with ADP, the RNA expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 was little changed (Supplementary Figure S3A and B). P2Y13 signaling can suppress the activity of ADCY and the production of cAMP. To confirm that, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated or not with MRS 2211 before being treated with ADP. As shown in Figure 5A, ADP significantly suppressed the production of cAMP, while P2Y13 antagonist MRS 2211 rescued this phenomenon. However, to our surprise, VSV infection caused an obvious increase in cellular cAMP levels (Figure 5B). Besides, P2Y13-deficient PEMs showed higher cellular cAMP levels than wild-type PEMs during VSV infection (Figure 5C). So, we examined the role of cAMP in ADP/P2Y13-mediated antiviral activities. We first found that ADCY activator forskolin blocked ADP-mediated antiviral activity completely (Figure 5D and E). Furthermore, cAMP treatment promoted viral replication obviously and also rescued the ADP-reduced cell cytopathic effects and VSV replication (Figure 5F and G; Supplementary Figure S3C and D). Consistent with this, KH7 (a selective inhibitor of ADCY) treatment significantly inhibited cell cytopathic effects and VSV replication (Supplementary Figure S3E and F). ADP-mediated antiviral activities were also significantly blocked by KH7 (Figure 5H and I). The cell viability assays revealed that these phenomena were not caused by the toxicity of forskolin, cAMP, and KH7 (Supplementary Figure S3G\u2013I).

Thus, we treated HeLa cells with ESI-09 (EPAC1/2 inhibitor), HJC0350 (EPAC2 selective inhibitor), and H89 (PKA inhibitor) at a safety concentration (Supplementary Figure S4A\u2013C). As shown in Supplementary Figure S4D, the replication of VSV is dramatically suppressed by both ESI-09 and H89, but not HJC0350, suggesting that EPAC1 and PKA may be involved in ADP/P2Y13-mediated restriction to VSV. However, when we inhibited PKA with H89, the replication of VSV (Figure 6A) and HSV-1 (Figure 6B) in HeLa cells are still suppressed by ADP, whereas ADP-reduced VSV, HSV-1, and NDV replication was significantly blocked by ESI-09, but not HJC0350 (Figure 6C\u2013F and Supplementary Figure S4E). Besides, the ADP-reduced VSV-G expression was also blocked by ESI-09 (Figure 6G). These data show that EPAC1 is crucial in ADP/P2Y13-mediated antiviral activities. In addition, we generated an EPAC1-knockout cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Figure 6H). As shown in Figure 6I and J, when EPAC1 is deficient, ADP-mediated suppression of VSV RNA replication and VSV-G expression were eliminated. Taken together, these results demonstrated that ADP/P2Y13-mediated antiviral activities are dependent on EPAC1. Inhibiting EPAC1 with ESI-09 in RAW264.7 cells significantly suppressed VSV and HSV-1 replication, and EPAC1 knockout also inhibited HSV-1 replication, demonstrating that either inhibition or deletion of EPAC1 has broad-spectrum antiviral activities (Supplementary Figure S4F\u2013H).",

            "text": "P2Y12 and P2Y13, as membrane receptors for ADP, are both Gi-coupled receptors that inhibit the activity of ADCY and reduce the production of cAMP (Vitiello et al., 2012). P2Y12 is highly expressed in platelets and plays a central role in platelet activation, which has become a drug target for atherothrombotic diseases, whereas P2Y13 is mainly expressed in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and brain (Savi et al., 2006; Vitiello et al., 2012). Previous studies have shown that P2Y12 and P2Y13 are both involved in the development of pain behavior during nerve injury and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kobayashi et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2017). However, the role of P2Y12 and P2Y13 receptors in viral infection remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that P2Y13 is upregulated by type I IFN (P2Y12 is little changed) and its endogenous ligand, ADP, is released as danger signals from virus-infected cells. Consequently, extracellular ADP-activated P2Y13 protects the host against viral infection in a cAMP-dependent manner. Thus, our study reveals an important role of ADP/P2Y13 in fighting against viral infection, which demonstrates the potential of purinergic receptors as novel antiviral targets.",

            "text": "Upon viral infection, the host initiates a series of signaling cascades to induce the production of type I IFN, which results in the induction of ISGs to exclude invaded virus (Ooi et al., 2014; Zhan et al., 2015). Previous studies reported that ISGs could further promote the production of type I IFN to eliminate the virus, such as ISG15 and IFIT3 (Lu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2011). Therefore, we tested whether ADP/P2Y13 influences the expression of type I IFN. Our results show that ADP enhanced IFN expression by only a little. Because ADP clearly inhibited virus replication, we hypothesized that there must be another way for ADP/P2Y13 to restrict viral infection. Thus, the classic Gi-coupled signaling pathway came to mind. Interestingly, we found that ADP-inhibited VSV replication and cell cytopathic effects were rescued by both ADCY activator forskolin and cAMP. Moreover, similar to ADP, the ADCY inhibitor KH7 also inhibited VSV replication, suggesting that cAMP plays a key role in ADP/P2Y13-mediated antiviral activities.",

            "text": "As the first identified second messenger, cAMP plays a crucial role in microbial pathogenesis (McDonough and Rodriguez, 2011). PKA and EPAC are the two classical sensors for intracellular cAMP, which are essential for many biological processes (Gloerich and Bos, 2010). PKA plays important roles in metabolism, cell cycle, cell migration, differentiation, and apoptosis (Yan et al., 2017). Previous studies have reported that PKA can inhibit IFN induction of the JAK/STAT pathway (David et al., 1996). Recently, a new study reported that PKA catalytic (PKAC) subunits \u03b1 and \u03b2 could negatively regulate RNA virus-triggered signaling and ultimately attenuate the innate antiviral response (Yan et al., 2017). EPAC has two isoforms, EPAC1 and EPAC2. The cAMP/EPAC signal pathway is important for controlling various cellular functions, including cell adhesion, exocytosis, and microtubule dynamics. Previous studies have reported that EPAC1 is a potential target for the treatment of fatal rickettsioses and that the silencing of EPAC1 gene expression renders cells resistant to MERS-CoV infection (Gong et al., 2013; Tao et al., 2014). In our study, we found that both PKA and EPAC inhibitors suppress viral replication. However, only EPAC inhibition could block ADP/P2Y13-mediated antiviral activities. Also, we found that the EPAC2 inhibitor could not block ADP/P2Y13-mediated antiviral activities. These findings suggest that ADP/P2Y13-mediated antiviral activities are mainly dependent on EPAC1. Knockout of EPAC1 in HeLa cells showed similar results and further proved this point. Taken together, our results showed that, upon viral infection, the virus can trigger an upregulation of intracellular cAMP levels to activate EPAC1 and thereby facilitating virus replication. However, the virus also triggers ADP released from these cells, which will activate P2Y13 and suppress the cAMP/EPAC1 signal pathway to restrain virus replication. This phenomenon revealed a negative feedback regulation in animals during viral infection, and that activation of P2Y13 and inhibition of the cAMP/EPAC1 signal pathway are potential antiviral strategies.",
