Complete, consistent and accurate data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneously recorded, original or a true copy and accurate (ALCOA).\u201d[16] Data are to be recorded exactly as intended, and when retrieved at a later time, should be the same as originally recorded.

Highly contagious and rapidly spreading viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, require comprehensive measures to avoid human-to-human spread. With the ongoing pandemic, the world has progressively witnessed a reduction of airline activity to almost zero with widespread travel bans, and limitation of private and public transportation, temporary closure of retail businesses, banning of public gatherings and the requirement to work from home. All these measures are designed to limit exposure to potential carriers of the virus. Individual measures, such as meticulous hand hygiene, self-isolation and social distancing, are encouraged. Public measures, such as quarantines, curfews or lockdowns, have been implemented. However, sectors, such as healthcare, food supply chains, law enforcement, governmental agencies and regulatory bodies, remain indispensable, with an increased workload challenging the capacity of local and national systems, as well as risking (if not sufficiently protected) the well-being of individuals. Overall, the majority of people stay at home, work remotely and limit use of healthcare systems as much as possible.",

Moreover, given that enrolment requires adequate assessment of eligibility, including protocol-required tests and written informed consent procedures, enrolment should be suspended or, if possible, slowed down. Follow-up visits should be performed via telehealth when possible. Extension of follow-up periods may be required to facilitate complete data collection.

When inclusion is delayed by the pandemic, it should be dealt with in a similar manner to other circumstances that lead to a low recruitment rate.

Trials in patient populations with acute presentations (e.g. ST-elevation MI [STEMI]) may identify potentially suitable trial candidates; however, the capacity to comply with study procedures needs to be assessed, as well as considerations related to patient safety during follow-up. It is also pertinent to consider that COVID-19 may mimic some classical presentations, such as STEMI; ECG changes are shown to reflect myocarditis, after angiography demonstrates non-obstructive disease. It is problematic when the trial design mandates a protocol-related treatment before angiography. Furthermore, the analysis of outcomes may be rendered more difficult, and parallel analyses of the intention-to-treat and per protocol populations will be pertinent. Participants in the follow-up phase (when they are generally at home) constitute a higher-risk population in the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, with isolation measures, participants have limited access to investigational sites. Therefore, a switch to telehealth (with data protection measures in place) should be considered, as well as postponement/cancellation of face-to-face visits. Ascertainment of primary endpoints should be prioritised, and if these need a particular test, consideration should be given to local laboratories or imaging centres closer to the participant\u2019s home.",

Importantly, a common approach to follow-up during the pandemic should be agreed upon among sponsors and investigators, and investigators should inform trial participants of any changes by means of newsletters or individual communications, including aspects affecting follow-up visits. Communication is critical. When adjusting visits or study procedures, the patient perspective must be captured. More specifically, participants may need to re-consent after being informed of the changes with the explicit possibility of stopping participation. Notwithstanding, participants should not visit investigational sites for the purpose of re-consenting. An alternative approach is a video call supplemented with a confirmatory email.[11] Drug trials add the complexity of drug supply and the need to maintain blinding. Consideration should be given to shipping drugs directly to homes from the investigational sites, ensuring that transportation and storage conditions are appropriate. Drug accountability and compliance should be monitored.[9,11,13,14]",

Coordinating centres execute the study, or activities within, on behalf of the sponsor or manufacturer. A study team is composed of a project manager, clinical research associates and study monitors, data managers, biostatistician, quality assurance manager and safety reporting units, with or without a medical monitor. A pandemic prompts the need to work from home and cancel face-to-face visits. Where systems are upgraded to allow remote work and staff remain available for reception of materials, coordinating centres can continue to operate during a pandemic. Site initiation and monitoring visits are cancelled, postponed or performed remotely using web-based technology (although source data verification can be postponed). Remote monitoring is possible, but might not be feasible at all participating sites in a trial and increases the workload at the site. Moreover, technical requirements, confidentiality issues, updated consents and the increased burden to site personnel could make it impractical.[13] In line with this, quality assurance measures, such as site audits, are postponed unless serious non-compliance is identified.",

Typically, the steering committee is composed of established investigators or key opinion leaders, and representatives from parties involved (e.g. coordinating centres, sponsor, grant givers). During the pandemic, office-based professionals work from home, and participation may be limited. Nevertheless, given the oversight duties of the steering committee and data and safety monitoring boards, the frequency of meetings might need to be increased to address immediate pandemic-related needs. At the beginning of the pandemic, cardiovascular clinicians saw a reduction in patient load, as the population was advised to stay at home. Unfortunately, this has resulted in late presentations of severe conditions (e.g. non-STEMI or decompensated heart failure). However, as hospital resources are depleted, not only in materials but also in personnel, cardiovascular clinicians are required to perform pandemic-related tasks and to self-isolate, potentially limiting their availability for participation in committees. The same applies to members of clinical event committees and data and safety monitoring boards. Potential exceptions are data managers and biostatisticians. In theory, this could reduce the availability of clinicians to participate in committee calls; however, in practice, this might not be the case. Committed investigators tend to stretch time when required, as shown by Chinese investigators who managed to report initial cohorts despite being at the centre of the pandemic.[2,4] All meetings are planned as teleconferences.",

Thus, for a core laboratory to ensure timely delivery during a pandemic, conditions should allow analysts and supervisors to work remotely. Data should reach core laboratories electronically, with secure and certified data-transfer providers. Time windows for imaging follow-up might need to be adjusted and uploading activities may also be interrupted. Analysing cardiovascular images might not be as efficient at home when compared with a well-equipped work environment. However, remote access through a secure connection to software and datasets, as well as databases, will allow continuity of activities. Information and communication technology departments play a pivotal role in setting up and maintaining reliable infrastructure.

The inability to deliver investigational drugs could pose additional risks to participants and warrants an increased level of safety monitoring.[9,10] Ongoing trials lacking data and safety monitoring boards might need to revisit that decision on a per-case basis. Data and safety monitoring boards may independently assess an ongoing trial that has been severely affected by the pandemic (e.g. incomplete data, incomplete follow-up) to help investigators and sponsors elucidate, without compromising the integrity of the trial, whether continuing the trial will yield interpretable data.[12]",
