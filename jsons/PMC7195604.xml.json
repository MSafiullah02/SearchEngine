There are nine TCM ingredients in RDS: Schizonepetae Herba (Jingjie), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), Forsythiae Fructus (Lianqiao), Scrophulariae Radix (Xuanshen), Gleditsiae Spina (Zaojiaoci), Armeniacae Semen Amarum (Kuxingren), Nidus Vespae (Fengfang), Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma (Gancao) and Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma (Renshen). The nine TCM ingredients in this prescription have been used together as an herbal formula in clinical practice for more than a decade and have been effective for the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory tract infections, as well as the common cold and flu. In recent months, clinical trials of RDS have been conducted to evaluate its efficacy in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia, finding that RDS has treatment value and no observed side effects [10]. Additionally, eight out of the nine ingredients in RDS are plant-derived; the other ingredient is honeycomb. All nine ingredients are approved as dietary supplements by the United States Food and Drug Administration, indicating that their long-term use is considered to be safe in the US. RDS has therapeutic benefits in both disease prevention and treatment against COVID-19; these benefits may have global significance [10].",

The complex nature of TCM makes it difficult to study the action of the full prescription through the reductionist approach taken in contemporary medical research, which would recommend separating out individual herbal ingredients and potential targets in the investigation process [14], [15]. In the era of -omics technologies, a vast amount of data have become available and in some avenues of research, the focus has shifted emphasis from the classic \u201cdrug-reductionist\u201d to the novel \u201cdrug-holistic\u201d system-based approaches [16].

It is the main protease that cleaves host polyproteins into viral replication-related proteins, and is highly conserved across the coronavirus family, including SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [22]. Therefore, it is an important target for the design of potential anti-coronavirus inhibitors [23]. One efficient approach used to screen potential active compounds against specific target proteins, such as 3CLpro, is molecular docking simulation [22], [23], [24], [25]. It is a universal and efficient approach in modern drug design and drug discovery.",

A network of interactions among each TCM in the RDS formula, their meridian tropism, chemical composition and potential target proteins was established to investigate the possible pathways of action. This approach helps to predict the biochemically active constituents of this TCM prescription; it also provides a way to develop an in-depth understanding of how a complex drug system works to treat a complex disease. It is an important research strategy to understand the possible intervention mechanism of RDS on COVID-19 from the perspective of the biological and molecular networks. This knowledge could help to develop an early prevention and treatment scheme to manage COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, the ability of the active constituents of RDS to bind with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (6LU7) was evaluated using computational pattern recognition to test the likelihood of molecular docking. Finally, the chemical constituents present in RDS were tested against the putative biochemically active constituents identified in this study using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in data-independent analysis mode (MSE) with non-targeted and targeted approaches. Through the above studies, biochemically active constituents from the RDS formula and their likely pathways of action were identified.",

All five genes were in key nodes of the RDS network, indicating that these compounds and targets may play a greater regulatory function in the RDS network. Delving further into the biological functions of the five genes and their proteins, all have significant roles in gene expression, cellular proliferation and differentiation, while PPARG and GSK3B are also involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, respectively. RDS may affect these crucial host cellular pathways to enhance overall health of the body and improve the body\u2019s ability to fight against viruses. Unlike SARS, where the most affected organ is the lung, the new coronavirus attacks not only the lung, but also the heart, kidneys, intestines and other organs, causing multiple organ failure within a short time window. Although the disease is located in the lung and requires immediate medical care, in TCM theory it is necessary to consider that deficiency of the Lung will affect the Stomach and the Spleen and damage the Heart and the Kidneys as well. Based on the analysis of the ingredients and meridian tropism network, seven out of nine ingredients enter the Lung meridian, because the disease is located in the Lungs and should be treated with priority. Through the present analysis, which incorporates elements of allopathic medicine and TCM meridian tropism, it can be seen that TCM encompasses therapeutic effects that may extend beyond our current scientific, measurable understanding of the disease process. Fortunately, the lack of precision in pairing TCM\u2019s theoretical framework with the currently-known understanding of COVID-19 has not hindered its successful application in this critical disease.

However, it is unknown whether the candidate compounds in RDS have any anti-coronavirus activity, such as blocking the penetration, uncoating or synthesis of viral proteins or nucleic acids. The SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (PDB: 6LU7) is required for the replication of coronaviruses and considered a validated target in the design of potential anti-coronavirus inhibitors [20], [22], [23]. A computational strategy for modeling molecular docking was used to evaluate the affinity between candidate constituents of RDS and 3CLpro. This technique helps to identify RDS constituents that may interact directly with SARS-CoV2 (Fig. 7). After preliminary screening, 48 constituents demonstrated binding affinity with 3CLpro; using commercially available samples of these constituents, 22 out of the 48 had inhibition rates greater than 50% at a concentration of 100 \u00b5mol/L, in the 3CLpro inhibition assay (unpublished data). These results indicate that the bioactive constituents of RDS might possess direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in addition to their effects on the body. In the phytochemical analysis of RDS, about 80% of the constituents identified were provided by four of the nine herbs in the formula. The other five herbs each contained fewer than 10 of the identified constituents. Based on the results from the virtual screening and the in vitro 3CLpro inhibition assay, seven out of 22 bioactive constituents could be identified and confirmed using LC\u2013MS targeted extraction and analysis (Table 3). The results suggested that these seven bioactive compounds could be used in a subsequent study for drug discovery and could be important makers for quality control testing of the prescription.",

            "text": "A literature search was also performed to retrieve prior studies on the seven bioactive compounds identified in this study [13]. Half of the ingredients in the RDS prescription are classic toxin-clearing TCM with antiviral activity, including Forsythiae Fructus, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Schizonepetae Herba, Gleditsiae Spina and Nidus Vespae [11]. Among the seven compounds, luteolin [55], [56], [57], [58] and quercetin [59] from Forsythiae Fructus, and fisetin from Gleditsiae Spina [60] have been studied for their toxin-clearing and antiviral activities. Besides, some understudied compounds from Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma (e.g., licoisoflavone B, glyasperin F, isolicoflavonol and semilicoisoflavone-B) have also shown similar inhibitory effects against 3CLpro, indicating their antiviral potential. These bioactive constituents and ingredients should be considered to be new candidate drugs and may provide novel perspectives to antiviral drug discovery and development.",

In this study, the multi-faceted system of TCM prescription has been integrated with the targets, disease pathways and their Zang-fu viscera to show an intricate network of interaction. This work shows that applying modern biological and pharmacological technologies to TCM research can deepen the mechanistic understanding of TCM compound formulas and better promote their clinical application. There is no doubt that the establishment of novel prescriptions based on TCM theory requires more effective integration of sub-disciplines and technologies.",
