            "text": "Meropenem is a broad-spectrum injectable carbapenem commonly used for empirical therapy of severe sepsis or septic shock. Anti-bacterial activity of meropenem is related to the fraction of time (fT) between doses during which the plasma concentration (Cp) is maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the infecting organism [1]. In vitro and in vivo animal models suggest that for the optimal bactericidal activity for carbapenems, the Cp must remain above the MIC for the pathogen for at least 40% of dosing interval (fT > MIC > 40) [2, 3]. Other pharmacokinetic (PK) targets like targeting Cp more than four times of MIC for at least 40% of dosing interval (fT > 4 \u00d7 MIC > 40) and continuous exposure of meropenem above the MIC (fT > MIC = 100 and fT > 4 \u00d7 MIC = 100) have also been suggested. The fT > MIC can be increased by prolonging the duration of infusion for \u03b2-lactams [4]. Extended infusions (EI), with the dose delivered over several hours, and continuous infusions over 24 h have been proposed in place of the usual intermittent infusions given over a few minutes to an hour, to improve the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties [5\u201313].",

Therefore, not surprisingly, Vd was found to be higher in our patients than reported in healthy individuals [24]. The implications of our findings are that patients with severe sepsis or septic shock would require higher doses to account for increased Vd. Studies in which an EI was preceded by a bolus of meropenem have shown that the PK goals were achieved in a majority of patients [12, 17, 18]. A bolus dose preceding the EI would increase the Cmax as well as the Cp in the first hour. However, several other studies have shown that an EI without a preceding bolus is equally effective in conditions such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, febrile neutropenia with bacteraemia, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, suspected Gram-negative infections and critically ill patients with septic shock requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [10, 13, 24\u201329]. In most of these studies, Cp remained greater than MIC for a greater fraction of time with the EI of meropenem without a prior bolus, compared to a 1-h infusion administration of meropenem. Our current regimen was based on these studies. However, we observed delayed Cp > 4 \u03bcg/mL in our patients. Based on our pharmacokinetic modeling, we determined that a bolus of 500 mg of meropenem would achieve Cp of 4 \u03bcg/mL and a bolus of 1500 mg would be sufficient to achieve Cp of 8 \u03bcg/mL almost immediately.",

Based on our pharmacokinetic modeling, meropenem at a dose of 1500 mg, rather than 1000 mg, given as an EI with a preceding bolus of 500 mg before the first dose would achieve this therapeutic target. Many authors believe in a more aggressive pharmacodynamic target of fT > MIC = 100% for prolonged or continuous infusions [30].

Since a rich sampling strategy was followed in our study, these estimates are likely to be highly accurate.
