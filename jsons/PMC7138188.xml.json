The most common therapy-related toxicities noted in most studies using this regimen have been febrile neutropenia, mucositis, and diarrhea.14\n,\n15\n,\n18 Our study also found a high rate of nausea/vomiting and electrolyte abnormalities. The incidence of septic complications with TBC conditioning appears to be greater than that with other conditioning regimens and has also led to higher rates of treatment-related mortality. In our study, the TRM rate was 8.3% (all from septic complications), and other institutions have reported a range of 0% to 14.3% with TBC conditioning in patients with PCNSL.8\n,\n15\n,\n18\n,\n42 The reason for this increased toxicity is not clear. Although some studies have found age > 60 years to be a factor,8 others have found no such association.18 Scordo et al18 hypothesized that the high TRM rate might be secondary to busulfan if the levels are greater than the therapeutic range. However, they found that patients with elevated first-dose busulfan area under the curve values did not experience more toxicity.18\n",

Therefore, the data thus far show no superior outcomes with the removal of cyclophosphamide from the TBC conditioning regimen. However, given that only 1 study has examined thiotepa and busulfan alone and it had a small sample size of only 16 patients, the true benefit of cyclophosphamide remains undetermined.",
