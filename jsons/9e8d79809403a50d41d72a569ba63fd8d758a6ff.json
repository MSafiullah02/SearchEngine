From submicroscopic infectious particles (viruses), small unicellular cells (bacteria and yeasts) to multinucleate and multicellular organisms ( fi lamentous fungi, protozoa, and helminths), microorganisms have found their way into virtually every environmental niche, and show little restrain in making their presence felt. While a majority of microorganisms are free-living and involved in the degradation of plant debris and other organic materials, others lead a symbiotic, mutually bene fi cial life within their hosts. In addition, some microorganisms have the capacity to take advantage of temporary weaknesses in animal and human hosts, causing notable morbidity and mortality. Because clinical manifestations in animals and humans resulting from infections with various microorganisms are often nonspeci fi c (e.g., general malaise and fever), it is necessary to apply laboratory diagnostic means to identify the culprit organisms for treatment and prevention purposes.",

Application of light microscopy or transmission and scanning electron microscopy (EM) together with stains/dyes helps reveal additional morphological details. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Gram, Giemsa, crystal violet stains are common stains used to enhance the contrast of microbes to their background. Additionally, Gimenez' and Pinkerton's stains are useful for detection of rickettsial organisms in tissue sections; Ziehl-Nielsen, Kinyoun, or auramine O stains for initial detection of mycobacteria; KOH, lactophenol cotton blue, India ink, and Southgate's mucicarmine stains for detection of fungi; periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS), Fontana-Masson, Gridley's, and H&E stains for detection of mycotic elements in tissue biopsies. In general, morphological characterization is rapid and inexpensive, but has relatively low sensitivity and speci fi city, and its result interpretation is somewhat subjective. To improve the sensitivity and speci fi city of microscopic detection of pathogenic microorganisms (especially viruses), fl uorescently labeled antibodies may be utilized. Application of highly sensitive and speci fi c fl uorescent sensor molecules in electron microscopy, fl uorescence microscopy, or time-lapse microscopy has further enhanced morphological characterization of microorganisms. Besides unraveling paradigms of pathogen entry and pinpointing the exact intracellular location, these new techniques permit direct monitoring of the intracellular lifestyle of microbial pathogens and yield insights into the underlying mechanisms of their pathogenicity [ 2, 3 ] . Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques offer a powerful platform for analyzing the structure, properties and functions of microbial pathogens as well as the localization, mechanics, and interactions of the individual cell wall constituents, contributing to the elucidation of the molecular bases of cell adhesion (nanoadhesome) and mechanosensing (nanosensosome) [ 4, 5 ] .",

Application of nucleic acid ampli fi cation technologies further improves the speed, sensitivity, and speci fi city of microbial identi fi cation and detection carbohydrates (e.g., the formation of acids, alcohols and gases when grown in selective liquid or solid media), to determine the ability of carbohydrates to utilize substrates such as citrate and malonate, to examine the metabolism of protein and amino acids (e.g., gelatine liquefaction, indole production, amino acid decarboxylase test, and phenylamine deaminase test) as well as of fats (e.g., hydrolysis of tribtyrin), and detect production of enzymes (e.g., catalase test, oxidase test, urease test, ONPG test, and nitrate reduction). Assessment of fungal primary metabolites such as ubiquinones (coenzyme Q) is useful for the taxonomy of black yeasts and fi lamentous fungi, whereas examination of fungal secondary metabolites (e.g., steroids, terpenes, alkaloids, cyclopeptides, and coumarins) by chromatographic techniques provides another means for fungal identi fi cation. A recent approach for biochemical characterization of microorganisms centers on the characteristic outer surface charges of microbes that contribute to their distinct migration under a direct-current electric fi eld such as capillary electrophoresis (CE), leading to rapid and ef fi cient separation, identi fi cation, quantitation, and characterization of intact microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, viruses, and fungi) [ 6 ] . Another useful technique for biochemical characterization of microbes is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-fl ight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), which has been shown to be useful for speci fi c identi fi cation of Francisella and other microbial pathogens [ 7 ] . Serological characterization on the basis of speci fi c reactions between host antibodies and microbial antigens (usually protein or carbohydrate) provides highly sensitive, speci fi c, and rapid identi fi cation of microorganisms. Detection of rising levels of speci fi c IgA, IgM, and IgG antibody titers or seroconversion in blood, urine, and fecal materials offers indirect evidence for causal relationships between diseases and microbial pathogens [ 8 ] . An interesting development in the serological characterization of disease-causing microorganisms is the use of chemically synthesized peptides. Generated by chemical approaches, these peptides are composed of two or more amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. By mimicking naturally occurring peptides or segments of proteins, these peptides serve as synthetic antigens in peptide microarrays as potential diagnostic tools in high-throughput immunoassays [ 9 ] . Other new developments in serological characterization of microorganisms include biosensors and nanotechnology (nanoarrays and nanochips). Biosensors involve the use of a microbe-speci fi c antibody and a transducer (e.g., electrochemistry, re fl ectometry, interferometry, resonance, and fl uorimetry) to convert a biological interaction into a measurable signal. In the particle concentration fl uorescence immunoassay (PCFIA) for brucellosis, submicron polystyrene particles are coated with antigen and placed in a 96-well vacuum plate. After addition of fl uorescent conjugate followed by vacuum fi ltration to remove unbound conjugate, the total particle-bound fl uorescence is measured by front surface fl uorimetry. Nanotechnology (nanoarrays and nanochips) offers small scale platforms to identify an array of infectious agents or serotypes on a single chip.",

In vitro isolation and propagation on laboratory media and cell lines offers a valuable tool for identi fi cation and diagnosis of microbial infections. The size, color, shape and form of colonies formed by microorganisms on nutritional agar and other selective media are diagnostically informative. In case of viral pathogens, the formation of a region of dead cells resulting from viral growth (called a \"plaque\") suggests their cytopathogenic effects (CPE). Parasitic protozoa may also be cultivated as a means of identi fi cation [ 11 ] . However, because not all microorganisms will grow in laboratory media and cell lines, embryonated eggs, insect vector, and laboratory animals (e.g., rodents) may be utilized. For example, Trypanosoma cruzi , the causal agent for Chagas disease, is grown in the guts of its vector triatomine bug for con fi rmation and diagnosis. The availability of cultured isolate/strain permits further antigenic studies, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and genetic studies. Despite their relatively high expense and length of time required, in vitro and in vivo techniques have contributed to the studies of microbial taxonomy, biology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment response. A recent development in the use of in vivo techniques for microbial characterization relates to the in vivo bioluminescence imaging or biophotonic imaging (BPI). Based on genetically engineered bioluminescent/ fl uorescent microorganisms, this technique enhances the study of microbial infections and host immune responses [ 12 ] . Application of genetically engineered mice with luciferase reporters for speci fi c microbial or host genes helps overcome the limitations of in vivo bioluminescence imaging for assessment of microbial replication, activation of key genes in host immunity, and response to tissue damage in vivo [ 13 ] .",

This often involves (1) disruption of cell walls, (2) denaturation of nucleoprotein complexes, (3) inactivation of endogenous DNase/RNAse, and (4) removal of contaminating proteins, polysaccharides, polyphenolic pigments, and other compounds [ 14 ] . While enzymatic digestion (e.g., using lyticase, zymolase, chitinase, gluculase, and/or proteinase K) and occasionally acid and alkali treatments may be effective for breaking up bacterial and yeast cells, mechanical grinding, sonication or bead-beating is often necessary to disrupt the mycelial and helminth cell walls.

The recent development of various easy-to-use commercial kits has negated the need to use hazardous organic solvents in the isolation of microbial DNA/RNA.

A more recent development in the DNA hybridizationbased approach is DNA microarray, in which high-density oligonucleotide probes (or segments of DNA) are immobilized on a solid surface, and used to hybridize (catch) any complementary sequences (labeled with fl uorescent nucleotides) in a test sample. Subsequent detection and quanti fi cation of fl uorescence signal permits identi fi cation and determination of the relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in a sample [ 16 ] . Although these nonampli fi ed procedures have adequate speci fi city, they are relatively insensitive, often requiring large quantity of starting materials for reliable detection. Nonetheless, some of these nonampli fi ed techniques remain valuable for comparison of microbial genomes and for identi fi cation of species-and virulencespeci fi c gene regions. For example, dot blot hybridization was employed for screening genomic DNA libraries of Dichelobacter nodosus strains causing virulent and benign footrot, and several virulent-and benign-speci fi c gene regions for subsequent differentiation of virulent and avirulent D. nodosus strains were identi fi ed as a result [ 17, 18 ] .

Biotyping separates microbial strains into \"biotypes\" on the basis of their metabolic and enzymatic activities (e.g., sugar fermentation, amino acid decarboxylation/deamination, urease activity, hydrolysis of compounds, hemagglutination, and hemolysis), colonial morphology, and environmental tolerances (e.g., tolerance to pH, chemicals, dyes, and heavy metals).

Although phenotypic procedures are useful for microbial identi fi cation, their time-consuming nature and occasional variability have provided the impetus for the development of nucleic acid detection methodology. With a high sensitivity, exquisite speci fi city and speed, molecular procedures especially those involving nucleic acid ampli fi cation (e.g., PCR) have been widely adopted in clinical and research laboratories for identi fi cation, typing, virulence determination, and drug resistance assessment of microorganisms of veterinary and medical importance. Further improvement through miniature and multiplexing will help reduce the cost of conducting molecular testing in diagnostic microbiology.",
