An underlying disease was found in 11 (79%) patients, including five preterm children and three immunocompromised patients. The details of the patients are shown in Table 2\n. The sequences of WUPyV had been identified from sputum specimens by metagenomic analysis from one immunocompromised child with respiratory failure (Table 2, Patient 3, Supplementary Data 1). The patients were classified into four groups based on their underlying conditions: immunocompromised (Group 1), preterm (Group 2), other underlying diseases (Group 3) or previously healthy patients (Group 4). All cases with prematurity (Patients 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and other underlying disorders (Patients 9, 10, 11) had a history of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Other viruses were co-detected in nine patients while only WUPyV was detected in five patients (Patients 5, 7, 9, 10, 11). Sputum cultures were evaluated in 11 patients, but clinically significant bacterial pathogens were not detected. All five patients in whom only WUPyV was detected had a history of admission to the NICU and presented with fever, cough, and respiratory distress and were intubated within one to six days after the onset of symptoms. The chest X-rays of the five patients are shown in Fig. 1\n. Typical findings were apparent perihilar bilateral infiltration compatible with viral pneumonia.",
