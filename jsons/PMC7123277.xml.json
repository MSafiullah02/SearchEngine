This progressive change of view toward a \u201cholistic\u201d approach to the cure and the care of the patient-family as a whole, greatly challenges ICU staff [12].

Nurses colleagues show strong bonds, forged by the unique, intense, and emotional challenges shared daily at their patients\u2019 bedsides. The shared experiences of their patients\u2019 pain, suffering, and death, as well as shared experiences of hope and healing, can bond nurses to their colleagues at deeper levels than those seen in other professions. But, similarly to the strong attachments between nursing colleagues, internal conflicts among nurses can be fierce. Horizontal violence (HV) is one of the terms used for behaviors ranging from verbal and emotional abuse to physical violence perpetrated by workers against their peers inside an organization [33]. The reported prevalence rate of this phenomenon among nurses ranges widely, from 5.7 [34] to 79.1% [33] and is associated with important psychosocial [35] and professional consequences. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in nurses, and high rates of job leaving are recorded in those with shorter lengths of service [36]. Moreover, some authors suppose that there may be a relationship between HV and patient safety, owing to changes in the flows of clinical information among nurses [37].",
