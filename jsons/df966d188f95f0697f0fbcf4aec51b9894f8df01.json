Indeed, patients who experience a decline in physical function after hospital discharge have a 250% increase in risk for hospital readmission or death. 15 Yet, provision of home-or community-based rehabilitation during this critical postdischarge period is associated with a 14% to 82% reduction in downstream hospital readmissions across medical, cardiac, and neurological diagnoses.

With many physical therapy clinics closed or experiencing substantial reductions in volume, there may also be opportunities to develop innovative home-or clinic-based care models for urgent musculoskeletal concerns that leverage staff availability. Interdisciplinary collaborations with orthopedic-trained physicians to set up urgent care spaces specific to musculoskeletal injuries may safely reduce ED crowding, utilize physical therapy clinic spaces, and help free up hospital resources to manage increasingly complex patients with COVID-19 who require high levels of ED care.Physical therapists are trained to be a first point of contact in the health care system-but completely closing outpatient clinics and defining rehabilitation as nonessential eliminate this opportunity for community-dwelling patients. This consequential decision might lead patients to seek care in overcrowded ED departments and urgent care clinics where risk of COVID-19 exposure may be higher.",

Because many nursing homes are unprepared or unwilling to take patients with COVID-19 who have recovered but may still be infectious, there will be a growing burden on home health care agencies and community clinicians to meet this demand.12 Currently, practice patterns in home health care have not been intensive, with the average older adult discharged from the ICU receiving only 4 visits of home rehabilitation.27  Published reports have also decried lack of availability of effective post-ICU rehabilitation in clinic-based settings, 28",

It is important to remember that telehealth is not a viable option for all patients, and relying solely on telehealth to deliver urgent physical therapy care may exacerbate existing health care disparities. Rural dwelling populations, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, those with learning disabilities, and those with cognitive, hearing, or visual impairments may be among those who cannot effectively participate in urgently needed physical therapy via telehealth platforms.Failure to meet these patients' needs during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing limited faceto-face visits may leave this vulnerable population more susceptible to hospitalization or institutionalization.The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed an existential crisis in our profession: Is what we do essential? The evidence suggests the answer to this question is, resoundingly, yes. Therefore, we encourage all home-and community-based therapists to fight to be recognized as essential health care providers across all care settings during the COVID-19 pandemic and to show our value in reducing avoidable hospitalizations and ED visits and in promoting optimal recovery of COVID-19 survivors.",
