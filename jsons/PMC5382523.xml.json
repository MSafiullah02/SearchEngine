            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped single-stranded\npositive sense RNA virus belonging to the Order Nidovirales, the family Coronaviridae and the genus Alphacoronavirus [1].\nFollowing detection in the US swine population during May, 2013 the virus spread\nrapidly across the country [2]. Initial\nrisk factors proposed for the spread of PEDV between herds included infected pigs,\ncontaminated transport and aerosols [3\u20135]. PEDV infection\nof nursery swine results in reduced performance and fecal shedding for out to 24 day\npost-infection (DPI) [3]. In regards to\nthe role of contaminated transport vehicles, data collected from the US suggests\nthat collection points, such as harvest facilities and livestock auction markets are\ncontaminated and can be a source of contamination of transport vehicles that return\nto pig farms [4]. Finally, PEDV RNA has\nbeen detected by PCR in aerosol samples out to 16 km from infected swine facilities\nand under experimental conditions may contain viable PEDV [5]. However, while pig-to-pig transmission of\nPEDV has been proven [3], controlled\ntransmission studies providing proof of concept regarding the role of aerosols and\ntransport have not been published at this time. In 2014, new risk factors for PEDV\nwere identified: contaminated feed and feed ingredients. Initial reports indicated\nthe ability of PEDV to survive in dry feed for 7 days and in wet feed for 28 days\nwhen stored at room temperature [6].\nProof of concept that contaminated complete feed could serve as a route of PEDV\ntransmission to na\u00efve pigs was published [7], with a follow-up report identifying spray-dried porcine\nplasma as a possible ingredient-specific risk [8]. Both of these studies collected contaminated feed material\nfrom farms or feed suppliers and performed controlled challenge studies involving\nna\u00efve pigs. In both cases, use of swine bioassay demonstrated infection in na\u00efve\npiglets following ingestion of contaminated feed bin material [7] or commercial plasma [8], therefore raising awareness of these risks.\nRecently, transmission of PEDV via ingestion of contaminated complete feed has been\nrepeated and the minimum infectious dose calculated at 5.6 x\n101TCID50/mL (Ct = 37)\n[9].",

Recently, a\nliquid antimicrobial (LA) product containing formaldehyde and propionic acid has\nbeen proposed as a means to mitigate risk (SalCURB\u00ae, Kemin Industries, Des Moines,\nIA, USA) [10]. This study demonstrated\nthe ability to prevent PEDV infection in pigs consuming contaminated complete feed\ntreated with LA [10]. However,\ninformation is not currently available regarding PEDV survival in other ingredients\nin swine diets or whether LA treatment can inactivate PEDV at the ingredient level.\nTherefore, a study was conducted to measure PEDV viability across a panel of\ningredients commonly encountered in swine diets in the presence or absence of a LA\npresently used to maintain feed and feed ingredients as Salmonella-negative for up to 21 days.

The viability of food borne illnesses, such as\nSalmonella sp. have likewise been studied in\nfeed and feed ingredients [11]. Based\non the fact that ingredient processing procedures can successfully render PEDV\ninactive [12], this study operated\nunder the premise of post-processing contamination of all ingredients. Under the\nconditions of this study, our results suggest that PEDV survival is\ningredient-specific, as 50 % of the non-treated ingredients harbored viable PEDV\nover some period of time while the remaining non-treated ingredients were VI and\nbioassay negative at 7, 14 and 30 DPI. The extended survivability of PEDV in SBM was\na novel observation and may have been influenced by environmental temperature, based\non the observed decrease in titer as temperatures increased over time. In addition,\nother novel information from this study included the recovery of viable PEDV from\nDDGS, 3 synthetic amino acids and dry choline chloride (all non-treated). A\nby-product of the ethanol industry, wet DDGS are stored outside/uncovered while dry\nDDGS are stored in open warehouses, raising the risk of post-processing\ncontamination. As they are widely used in swine diets and their turnover at mills is\nshort (1\u20132 days), if contaminated, as under the conditions of our study, virus may\nremain viable and the ingredient could pose a risk to complete feed during mixing.\nSimilarly, the observed variability in PEDV survival across the 3 amino acids raises\nthe question of whether ingredient chemistry, for example, D/L methionine, a\nsulfur-containing amino acid, may have influenced titer magnitude and duration. In\naddition, the detection of viable virus in both synthetic amino acids and choline\nchloride raises the awareness of both domestic risk and transboundary risk, due to\ntheir widespread global trade.",

Specifically, we inoculated\nequal amounts of each ingredient with an equivalent quantity of virus in an attempt\nto mimic published viral loads associated with field cases of PEDV in feed. All\ningredients were stored in identical containers, exposed to the same environment,\nsampled over periods representative of mill turnover times and tested in a single\nlaboratory, involving consistent, trained personnel and validated assays for the\ndetection of PEDV. We organized samples in a manner to prevent cross-contamination\nby insuring that the individual sample storage containers were never opened from the\ntime of PEDV inoculation until testing occurred at the laboratory. While this may\nhave resulted in some variability of the PCR assay since a new sample set was\nsubmitted each time, the fact that our negative control samples remained free of\ncontamination throughout the entire project validated these protocols. Finally, we\nused multiple metrics (PCR, VI and bioassay) to document viral load across a total\nof 320 samples.

As we were starting with\nPEDV-free ingredients, the day 1 sample would be used to confirm that\ncontamination occurred and the extended sampling would be used to estimate the\nduration of survival over a 30-day period. The specific sampling times were\nselected based on estimated ingredient turnover time at mills and processing\nplants, with certain bulk macro-ingredients, such as SBM, DDGS having short\nturnover times, i.e., 1\u20132 days of storage, while bagged micro-ingredients, such\nas synthetic amino acids, dry choline chloride and VTMs, have longer periods\n(21\u201328 days) of storage (C. Neill, personal communication, 2014). To increase\nstatistical power, it was planned to conduct 2 replicates of each ingredient\nwith LA treatment and 2 non-treated (placebo) replicates of each ingredient.\nTherefore, sixteen 30 g samples of each of the 18 ingredients (n = 288) were added to individual freezer storage\ncontainers (Oxo Tot Baby Blocks, Oxo International, El Paso, TX, USA). Half of\nthe samples of each ingredient (n = 144) were\ntreated with 0.1 mL of LA (Kemin Industries, Des Moines, IA USA), based on an\ninclusion rate of 3 kg/t of complete feed. SalCURB\u00ae is a premix of aqueous\nformaldehyde solution 37 % (for maintenance of complete animal feeds or feed\ningredients Salmonella-negative for up to\n21 days) and propionic acid (as a chemical preservative for control of mold in\nfeed or feed ingredients). While SalCURB\u00ae provides effective Salmonella control for up to 21 days, it is not\napproved for use by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration or the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture as a treatment for PEDV. The liquid antimicrobial was\nadded to the designated 30 g samples using a tuberculin syringe. To promote\nproper mixing, the feed was stirred manually for 10 clockwise rotations and 10\ncounter-clockwise rotations using individual wooden applicator sticks per\ningredient. The remaining 144 samples were treated using 0.1 mL of saline\nplacebo and mixed in a similar manner.",

This quantity of\nPEDV was selected in an effort to provide a final mean Ct value in feed\ningredient of approximately 25 (range = 19\u201330) following mixing, based on data\nfrom actual field cases of PEDV-contaminated feed (S. Dee, unpublished\nobservations, 2014\u20132015), a challenge level used in published studies\n[7, 10]. Once prepared, samples were stored\noutdoors in large plastic covered totes (Rubbermaid Cleverstore, 92.5 l\ncapacity, Newell Rubbermaid, Atlanta, GA, USA) with one tote containing LA\ntreated samples and the other the non-treated samples. Samples were stored\noutdoors (state of Minnesota, site coordinates latitude\n450 49\u2019 N, longitude\n950 33\u2019 W) during winter time ambient conditions\nfor a 30 day period (January 3\u2013February 2, 2015).

Therefore, to maximize virus survival and to accurately represent\n\u201creal-world\u201d conditions found throughout the feed industry in the upper Midwest\nUSA, storage under winter time ambient conditions was selected. During the study\nperiod, it was planned to remove 4 samples of each ingredient (2 LA treated, 2\nnon-treated) from their respective totes and submit for diagnostic testing on\nthe designated (1, 7, 14 or 30) DPI. In other words, the same sample was not\nrepeatedly opened and tested, but rather a new set of samples were submitted on\neach sampling day. Besides storage of ingredients in sealed individual\ncontainers, containers were stored in plastic bags by sample date, for example,\nthe day 7 samples were bagged separately from day 14 samples which were bagged\nseparately from the day 30 samples, etc. The comprehensive means of sample\nmanagement would insure that all sample containers remained sealed from the time\nthey were inoculated until the time they were tested at the lab, eliminating the\nrisk of cross-contamination during storage and delivery to the\nlaboratory.",

Each pig\nin the unit received 1 mL of the designated inoculum orally via syringe and\nobserved for a 7 day period. To minimize the number of animals needed for\nthe study, pigs that were confirmed negative after 7 DPI would be inoculated\nwith a different ingredient. A negative control unit was included in the\ndesign, with these pigs receiving sterile saline PO.",
