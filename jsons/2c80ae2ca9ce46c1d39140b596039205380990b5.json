First, effective surveillance, reporting, and contact tracing are needed to contain an epidemic at its emergence and to mitigate its impact at a later stage. Second, multi-sectoral efforts to offer incentives for those with no or minor symptoms to seek care and to quarantine themselves are critical, which would need concerted efforts from payers, providers, and public health. Third, sustained and routine prevention efforts involving both the public and the health systems will prove to be useful in times of a pandemic. Fourth, a strong public health system is essential and will be appreciated at times of urgency. Concerted multi-sectoral efforts are required to address COVID-19 pandemic with strong leadership from the public health sector.",

In addition to the growing number of deaths associated with COVID-19, the pandemic has put millions of people in full or partial quarantine, disrupted commerce, and caused meltdowns of the global financial market, with no clear end in sight at this moment. The rapidly changing situation warrants concerted efforts from governments around the globe. A viewpoint published 10 years after the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak highlighted the need for enhanced disease and symptom surveillance systems, effective infection control in all healthcare settings, and a central focus of public health for coordination and leadership with delegated responsibility and authority, among other things [5] . Unfortunately, the calls still stand true today for China, and possibly for the US and the rest of the world as well. In this commentary, we reemphasize the importance of the multi-sectoral collaboration between public health and healthcare provider, payer, and sectors beyond healthcare with lessons learned from efforts in China and the US to address the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In the aftermath of the SARS epidemics, China created an electronic infectious disease reporting system that collects individual case data with unified reporting card to the national Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Evidence indicated a delay in reporting of the early COVID-19 cases in the system, alluding to a lack of training of hospital staff and deficiencies in enforcing the reporting protocols, an important lesson for public health systems elsewhere. Early identification of cases and their close contacts are key in suppressing transmission of infectious diseases.

In the US, 28 million people do not have health insurance [8] . They would not be able to consult their family physician before going out for testing of COVID-19. In addition, although the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services has been made clear that screening, testing, and treatment of COVID-19 are not considered as \"public charge,\" undocumented immigrants may be deterred to seek public assistance [9] . Spanish-speaking population was found to be at greater risk of exposure to H1N1 during the 2008-2009 outbreak.

China's major payers, the Healthcare Security Administrations at various level, do not cover preventive services including influenza vaccination. Preventive services in China are financed through the limited basic public health services provided at the community health services organizations.
