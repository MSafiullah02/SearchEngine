The composition of air around us keeps changing continuously due to both natural as well as man made emissions into the atmosphere. Earth\u2019s atmosphere is a layer of gases retained by the gravity. On an average, as shown in Fig. 1.1 dry air consists of 78.09 % of nitrogen, 20.95 % of oxygen, 0.93 % of argon and 0.039 % of carbon dioxide by volume. Minor constituents such as methane (CH4), Ozone (O3), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ammonia (NH3) etc. are also present having very low mixing ratios. These constituents do vary place to place due to change in atmospheric conditions. The air constituents over the sea will not be same as at the shore; sea shore air may not have same concentrations of the constituents as desert air. Sea shore air will be dominated by water vapour where as desert air will have more suspended dust. Similarly, the thick Amazon forest will have more water vapour and volatile organic compounds whereas he air above solid waste dumping site is likely to have more methane and ammonia.\n",

The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) and the moist adiabatic lapse rate (MALR) are 9.8 and 4.9 \u00b0C/km respectively. Actual change of temperature with altitude for the stationary atmosphere or temperature gradient is known as Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR). Generally, decrease of 6.49 \u00b0C/km is considered as Environmental lapse rate. In the troposphere, atmospheric pressure also decreases rapidly with the altitude. One can understand that climbing to an altitude of 5.5 km, would put you above 50 % of the atmosphere\u2019s molecules where atmospheric pressure is 500 mb only. Actually, the heating of the surface creates warm air at surface. The warm air rises, but air expands as it rises and cools as it expands (Adiabatic cooling). Typically, the troposphere is characterized by warm air at surface and cooler air above. If the cooler air exists at surface and the warmer air above, this is called as Buoyancy. If a rising air parcel becomes saturated condensation occurs. The condensation warms the air parcel due to the release of latent heat. So, a rising parcel cools less if it is saturated",

In the stratosphere, temperature increases with altitude, from \u221260 \u00b0C at base to 0 \u00b0C at the top of the stratosphere. The increase in temperature is basically due to the absorption of solar energy by the ozone layer. Ozone (O3) is effective absorbing species for solar UV radiation (200\u2013310 nm with a maximal absorption at about 250 nm) in the stratosphere. Generally, UV-C (280\u2013100 nm) which is highly harmful is entirely screened out by dioxygen (<200 nm) and ozone (>about 200 nm) before 35 km height. UV-B (315\u2013280 nm) radiation is mostly screened by ozone layer. UV-A (400\u2013315 nm) reaches earth surface having small damage e.g. premature ageing of skin etc.\n",

In 1273, King Edward I prohibited burning of coal in London (William and Lou 2003). By the 1280s, people were using coal as fuel in processes like limekilns and metalworking leading to air pollution which had black smoke as well as oxides of sulphur. Late 18th and early 19th centuries saw dramatic changes in manufacturing, agriculture, mining, production as well as transportation. Invention of electric power in the nineteenth century resulted in coal fired electric generation in 1880s. Very famous example of air pollution is the smog formation around Los Angeles during the 1940s which led to the passing of first state environmental legislation in USA. In 1955, the Air Pollution Control Act was enacted in USA which was the first federal environmental legislation in the country. Later on in 1960s, oil overtook coal as the source of primary energy. Extensive use of oil led to the emissions wherever vehicles moved.",

The soil-dust which is generally dominated by CaCO3 effectively scavenge atmospheric SO2 forming calcium sulphate in the atmosphere (Kulshrestha et al. 2003). Due to this reason, in the regions where ambient levels of suspended particulate matter are very high violating the limits of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the pH of rain water has also been reported very high (Kulshrestha 2013). In these regions, the levels of ambient SO2 are recorded very low due to same reason. Figure 1.6a Shows that even at higher sulphate levels, the pH of rain water is higher in Indian region but in the acidified regions such as United States, the pH of rain water is highly acidic decreasing with the increase in sulphate concentrations (Fig. 1.6b). This suggests that in the acidified regions, sulphate is present as sulphuric acid whereas in dusty regions, sulphate is present as calcium sulphate in rain water.\n",

Around 11 Tg of NOx are emitted by the lightening, stratosphere and the soils representing the natural input of NOx. Fossil fule and biomass burning are the major sources of NOx which contribute around 40 Tg NOx per year (IPCC 2001). In addition, anthropogenic activities such as industries and automobiles also inject an array of metals and other chemicals in the atmosphere which ultimately have adverse effects on human health and the environment.\n\n",

Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution signed on 1979 is considered as pioneering international instrument which has paved the way for fruitful cooperation among 49 parties in Europe (Harald et al. 2004). Since, air has no boundaries, pollutants are transported globally from one geographic area. Several times remote and background sites are affected by LRT. There are examples where states having no air pollution sources are affected by LRT of pollution from distance or nearby countries or states. Rodhe (1972) demonstrated air pollution transport through air mass trajectory calculations and established that acid rain occurrence in Northern Europe was mainly due to industrial sources located in the south and west. Dust from The Thar Desert has been the primary potential source of particulate pollution in the Indian subcontinent. Also, the suspended particulate matter from the dust storms originated in Oman and other middle eastern regions has been reported to have influence on air quality in south Asia (Begum et al. 2011). Long-range transport of dust aerosols over the Arabian sea and Indian region has been reported by Badarinath et al. (2010). Kulshrestha and Kumar (2014) have reported LRT of pollution and its influence on rain water chemistry at Himalayan sites. According to the study, most of the acidic components such as sulphate and nitrate are transported from western airmasses and are deposited through precipitation having long term adverse impact on Himalayan ecosystem. Similarly, air pollution is the issue of transboundary transport of air pollution is an important issue between and within the countries. For example recent air pollution problem in New Delhi can be termed as transboundary pollution problem (Kulshrestha 2015). In 1990s, exhaust of diesel driven buses was mainly responsible for air pollution in Delhi city but after the Supreme Court decision, all the busses were replaced by CNG driven buses. This gave a big relief to the citizens of Delhi. But surprisingly, SO2 and NO2 levels were recorded extremely high during winter season of 2015 crossing 400 micrograms per cubic meter violating the NAAQS limit of 80 micrograms per cubic meter. Such observations were never reported in recent past winters. Such sudden increase can be explained on the basis of transboundary air pollution contributed by a number of new established brick kilns being operated in nearby states such as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab (Kulshrestha 2015). In addition, diesel driven heavy duty trucks entering from outside of Delhi also contribute significant amount of carbon and sulphur oxides making Delhi air polluted (Gupta et al. 2015).",

The key mechanism for the generation of stratosphere ozone is the breaking of molecular oxygen by solar UV with wavelengths of less than 242 nm by photolysis to make nascent oxygen atoms which in turn combines with molecular oxygen to make ozone. Ozone destruction occurs by reactions of oxygen atoms with ozone and reactions involving certain naturally occurring species like nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx: mostly NO and NO2), odd-hydrogen radicals (HOx: OH and HO2), and/or halogen radicals. The natural Ozone concentration vary daily (due to changing weather); seasonally; and multiannually and interannually. The concentration of stratospheric ozone can be changed by anthropogenic activity. Chemicals in emissions from anthropogenic activities responsible for deletion of stratospheric ozone are called The ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). Since the 1970s it has been recognized that a numerous chemicals emitted by anthropogenic activities deplete stratospheric ozone.",

Decline in reactive halogen concentrations are mainly due to the rapid phase-out as well as atmospheric decline of short-lived ODGs such as methyl bromide and methyl chloroform (Montzka et al. 1999, 2003). The reduction related to CFC-11 as well as CFC-12, has been less because of continuing emissions as well as their lifetimes are long (50\u2013100 years).

ABCs interrupt sunlight by reflecting and absorbing reflecting resulting in large surface dimming. On the other hand, black carbon as well as some organics augments atmospheric heating increasing global warming. Black carbon is mainly emitted due to Wildfires; and combustion of Biofuel, Coal, Diesel and Gasoline. As per Ramanathan and Feng (2009) ABC warms atmosphere at elevated levels from 2 to 6 km, resulting in retreating of glaciers as well as snow packs in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan glaciers. Aerosols may nucleate additional cloud droplets enhancing dimming effect (Fig. 1.13). The dimming decreases evaporation of water from the earth\u2019s surface, slowing down the hydrological cycle. According to some studies, in South Asia due to ABC dimming north-south gradients in sea surface temperatures as well as land\u2013ocean difference in surface temperatures, have slowed down the monsoon circulation and reduced rainfall over the continents. The following figure shows global estimates of dimming.\n",

Vegetation cover is drastically reduced in the urban areas due to sudden increase in built area. Developing countries are facing significant air pollution impact of land use change due to rapid urbanization. More significant effect is seen due to expansion of the cities for housing purpose which emits a huge amount of dust during the construction of buildings. The emissions of air pollutants from these residential colonies become a continuous source of polluted air. According to the data, about 60 % of agricultural land in Delhi has been transformed into nonagricultural area resulting in decrease in net sown area from 85,000 to 46,000 ha (Mohan et al. 2011). Same is the case for most of the cities. The urban dust has been reported highly rich in carbon and sulphate (Kulshrestha et al. 2005; Kumar et al. 2014; Gupta 2015). Dust sulphate significantly affect various biochemical constituents and the morphology of the plants (Gupta 2015). Figure 1.14 shows an increase in Ascorbic acid and Proline content of foliar with the increase in sulphate levels correlating with the increase in stress level. More severe effect is reported for the industrial area as compared to the residential areas due to more stress of pollutants at industrial site which affects plant physiology and morphology. Soil dust coming out from the digging of land and the construction activities could be the sources of microbes. The relationship between different types of house dust and the concentration of fungi has reported by Kaarakainen et al. (2009).\n",

At 7.00 AM as the number of vehicles on road increased visibility decreased as concretion of suspended particles in atmosphere increased and low temperature hindered dispersion of pollutants. At 1.00 AM the pollutants dispersed mainly due to increase in temperature and therefore dispersion of pollutants.\n\n",
