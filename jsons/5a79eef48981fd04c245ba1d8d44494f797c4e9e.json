Sociodemographic data include demographic, geographic, industry, trade, government expenditure, ecologic, and political data. Mobility metrics refer to the variation in attendance to location categories when compared to a baseline period, between January 3 and February 6, before the beginning of the social distancing initiatives outside China. If a country had 15.0 for a specific day, a Thursday, for example, in the residential variable, this means that on that date there was a 15% positive variation in visits/staytime when compared to the median of Thursdays between January 3 and February 6 in residential areas for that country. Epidemiological data includes the daily new and accumulated number of cases of and deaths due to COVID-19, among others.

The daily data related to the number of new cases and new deaths by COVID-19 for countries were downloaded from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the dataset was downloaded as a CSV file from their official website [3] .

For instance, we provide the date of the first COVID-19 case in each country, even for the ones that had the first case beforeFebruary 15, 2020, the first date in our dataset. For countries that had the first case before February 15, we collected dates from media reports. Additional variables were computed taking as reference this per-country first case date: (i) number of days since the first case; (ii) number of days since the first death; (iii) accumulated number of cases since the first case; (iv) accumulated number of deaths since the first death; (v) date of first confirmed death, and (vi) date of first confirmed case. Finally, we also provide the latest COVID-19 lethality rate for each country. The pipeline, datasets, and source codes are hosted at GitHub and mirrored at DAGsHub. The data is also available at Mendeley Data, as suggested by the journal. In the extra folder, there are code examples on how to use the dataset written in R or Python programming languages.
