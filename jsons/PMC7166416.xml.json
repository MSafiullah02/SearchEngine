            "text": "The results of this survey indicate that some canine and feline pathogens with a cosmopolitan distribution have been introduced into the Galapagos and are now endemic in the local dog and cat populations on Isabela Island. The dogs and cats were exposed to several common viruses, including CPV, FPV, CDV, CAV, CPiV, FCV, and FHV. None of the tested animals was exposed to enteric coronaviruses or infected with FeLV or FIV. Two thirds of the dogs were seropositive for CAV. The CAV\u20101 antibody titer exceeded or equaled the CAV\u20102 antibody titer in all but 1 dog, suggesting that CAV\u20101 was the predominant serotype and that the detection of CAV\u20102 reactivity may have been because of nonspecific cross\u2010reactivity, which is common for CAV. None of the viruses endemic in the dogs and cats on Isabela infects human beings, reptiles, or birds. Marine mammals are susceptible to some strains of CDV and FCV, although host range and transmission modes are poorly understood.\n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n CDV and FCV are highly contagious and are spread by virus shed in airborne droplets, in fecal material, or by direct contact with infected animals or fomites. The dogs and cats in Puerto Villamil frequently visit the beaches, and so there is potential for indirect contact with the beach\u2010dwelling Galapagos sea lions. However, during a distemper outbreak in dogs in 2001, serological tests of sea lions in the area showed no evidence of exposure to CDV.\n2\n, \n12\n\n",

Several puppies and adult dogs were observed with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis during the May 2004 sample collection period, but on\u2010site testing of feces for parvovirus antigen or collection of paired acute and convalescent serum samples for seroconversion was not possible. Because most of the dogs and cats presented for neutering appeared healthy and vaccination is prohibited, the high parvovirus antibody prevalence suggests that these animals were either subclinically infected or had recovered from infection at the time of testing. Parvoviruses are not known to affect the native species found in the Galapagos, but these viruses undergo rapid evolution and have occasionally increased their host range to new species, as evidenced by the jump from cats to dogs in the late 1970s.\n13\n, \n14\n\n",

            "text": "Distemper outbreaks have occasionally occurred in the Galapagos. One outbreak in 2001 originated on the island of Santa Cruz and killed more than 300 dogs.\n2\n, \n12\n A month later, dogs began to die of distemper on Isabela. Approximately 300 dogs died in the Isabela outbreak, leaving only 5 or 6 dogs remaining in Puerto Villamil and approximately 30 dogs on the highland farms or as strays. On both islands, the source of the infection was believed to be illegally introduced dogs. Authorities responded to the outbreak by quarantining healthy dogs indoors, culling sick dogs, and burning carcasses. Humans traveling from the mainland and between islands were treated with disinfectant in an attempt to prevent reintroductions of the virus. A door\u2010to\u2010door census conducted on Isabela 15 months after the 2001 distemper outbreak revealed that the dog population had rebounded to 197.\n2\n, \n12\n At the time of the neutering campaign in May 2004, a small portion of the dogs had CDV antibodies, but the antibody titers were low compared with those usually observed in vaccinated dogs or dogs recovering from infection. The presence of antibodies may be because of decreased specificity of the assay when using plasma (versus serum), because of cross\u2010reactivity with a related virus, or because of previous exposure to CDV. The small number of antibody\u2010positive dogs, coupled with low antibody titers and prohibition of vaccination, suggests that most of the canine population on Isabela Island is susceptible to distemper and a new epidemic could occur. The rapid recovery of the canine population so soon after its decimation by distemper illustrates the difficulty of controlling invasive species in the absence of ongoing programs. A similar phenomenon occurred after an eradication program on Isabela in 1981 in which the dog population was reduced from an estimated 300\u2013500 members to <100 by means of poisoning.\n5\n After the initial precipitous decline of the population because of the culling, it recovered to its original baseline by the 2001 distemper outbreak, after which it again recovered by the time of the neutering campaign in 2004.",

Although many species may be incidentally infected with D. immitis, canids are considered to be the true natural reservoir. One third of the dogs in the current study were infected with D. immitis, indicating that this parasite is endemic in the dog population of Isabela and that the local mosquito population is capable of transmitting infective larvae. Of the heartworm\u2010infected dogs, two thirds also had evidence of exposure to W. pipiens, an endosymbiont found in a variety of human and animal filarial parasites and now believed to play an important role in the pathology of filarial diseases.\n15\n, \n16\n Although it is believed that 100% of heartworms carry W. pipiens, it was not detected in all heartworm\u2010infected dogs. This may be because of the use of serum rather than whole blood in the PCR assay, because microfilaria, a rich source of W. pipiens, are not present in serum. Detection of W. pipiens in the circulation is most common during heartworm larval molting and at the time of heartworm death. In addition to the dogs, 1 cat had evidence of exposure to D. immitis. A study in the early 1980s made reference to finding D. immitis in dogs on Isabela, but the prevalence of infection was not reported.\n5\n This same study reported that 77% of dogs on Floreana Island had D. immitis microfilaria and 18% of cats had serum antibodies against D. immitis. To the authors' knowledge, there are no other reports on the prevalence of D. immitis infection in dogs and cats in the Galapagos or mainland Ecuador. Only a few of the 13 South American countries have reported heartworm infections in dogs, including Peru, Colombia, and Brazil, and the prevalence ranges from 2% in Brazil to 5% in Colombia.\n17\n Feline heartworm infection is seldom reported in South America but has been documented in Brazil.\n17\n\n",

This is most likely owing to persistence of endemic infections that were present before the strict control of interisland animal movements. Infections may also be introduced by the illegal smuggling of infected animals or by the adventitious contamination of people and supplies arriving by air or boat. Some of the infections posed a risk to humans or to native wildlife, but most were specific to dogs and cats. Because of the relatively small number of samples used in this study, particularly from cats, failure to identify specific pathogens should not be interpreted as evidence against their presence. Routine use of parasite prophylaxis, neutering, and strict enforcement of animal movement restrictions would control many of the diseases. However, in the absence of a vaccination program, a reservoir of susceptible animals remains vulnerable to new disease introductions.",
