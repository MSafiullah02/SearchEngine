The analysis is based on a calibrated residential building stock model for Saudi Arabia supported by national statistics regarding the characteristics of AC systems. Various housing prototypes, vintages, and locations are included in the analysis. Specifically, the analysis considers the scaling up of the government's High Efficiency AC (HEAC) program which offers 900 Saudi Riyals (240 USD) per unit to consumers for up to 6 split system units with an energy efficiency rating (EER) of 13.0 or more per household. The main findings of the study suggest that upgrading the existing old stock of window units and split systems currently in place to the requirements of HEAC program would generate a reduction in electricity consumption of around 33 TWh/year and 24 million tons of CO 2 . Due to the effect of the HEAC consumer subsidy, purchasing a high efficiency unit has a simple payback period for the consumer of 5 years which is faster than less efficient AC options. This would come at a cost to the government of approximately 6 Billion USD resulting in an annual income of 3.0 Billion USD from the sale of avoided fuel associated with the saved electricity consumption.",

Thus, significant increase in electricity consumption as well as peak demand occurs during summer months compared to the winter months. Howarth et al. [4] assessed the relationship between temperature variation, electricity generation, and AC use for KSA. For example, electricity generation reached 60 GW during 2015 summer days due to AC loads but was only 23 GW during 2015 winter days. As the country moves from winter to summer, each 1\u00b0C of temperature increase is found to require 1.18 GW of additional electricity generation. Similarly, Krarti et al. [5] have shown that KSA hourly electricity consumption follows closely outdoor ambient temperatures.",

Specifically, replacing the existing stock of inefficient window units with more efficient split systems through a 'cash for clunkers' program and phasing out new sales of window units has been identified as one of the highest impactful energy efficiency programs [4] . Moreover, the addition of thermal insulation for walls and roof as well as the installation of double-pane glazing for windows have evaluated in several studies [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . For instance, Al-Sanea [9] and Al-Sanea and Zedan [10] has indicated that it is better to place thermal insulation on the outer surface of building envelopes to significantly reduce both peak demand and annual cooling loads for Saudi housing units. Alaidroos and Krarti [11] showed that 50-mm polystyrene insulation layer added to both the roof and walls can reduce the annual electricity consumption by 25% for a villa located in Riyadh. The effect of the window glazing type to reduce cooling thermal loads depend significantly on window-to-wall ratio and shading devices of KSA buildings [11] .",

            "text": "The benefits and cost-effectiveness of large-scale programs to improve EER of AC stock for KSA have been evaluated by limited studies using simplified analyses. Specifically, Al-Mokeheimer [21] analyzed the economic and environmental impacts of improving MEPS requirements of AC systems serving KSA villas. In particular, the study found that improving the rated energy efficiency for all the existing AC systems so their EER becomes 13.0 would result in annual savings of 24.9 TWh of electricity consumption and 15.1 Million-Ton of CO 2 emissions. A recent study by Al-Musa [22] evaluated the benefits and the cost-effectiveness of a program to replace, over an 8-year [4] . For example, in 2011 the minimum standard EER required was the same for both window and split systems at 7.5. However, these minimal EER requirements for split systems had risen by 2018 to 11.8 but only to 9.8 for window units. Window AC units are inherently less efficient compared to split systems due to all components being located in one single unit. One reason suggested for this differential treatment is that high EER units and replacement of Freon 22 refrigerant would affect local production of window AC units. Therefore, lower standards for window AC units have been given to allow Saudi Arabian manufacturers time to change production to adjust to higher efficiency and environmental standards. While Freon R22 is banned under the Montreal Protocol, an exemption through 2023 has been given to KSA in order to give local manufacturers time to adjust [25] .",

The study outlined in this paper utilizes a validated detailed bottom-up approach of the KSA residential building stock to determine the cost benefits of various retrofit programs to improve the energy efficiency performance of air conditioning equipment commonly used in KSA residential buildings. Specifically, the analysis relies on detailed hourly simulation energy modeling of 54 prototypes of KSA housing units to evaluate the energy and environmental impacts as well as the cost benefits of various programs targeted to increase the rated Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) for both windows ACs and split units used by KSA households to maintain thermal comfort during the summer seasons. First, the analysis methodology considered in this study is described including an overview of the residential building stock model. Then, the type, the number, and the typical costs of existing AC stock in KSA are provided.

            "text": "In this section, select analysis results are presented to provide insights on the economic and environmental benefits of improving AC energy efficiency ratings including reduction of electricity peak demand as well as annual energy consumption for various KSA housing types and climatic conditions. Figure 6 illustrates the potential annual energy savings of using AC systems with different EER ratings in various villa vintages located in three KSA cities. The energy savings are expressed in percentage relative to the baseline conditions as noted in Tables 1 and 2 . As expected, the annual energy savings increase with the EER rating improvement and are higher for older than for newer villa vintages. It should be noted that for low EER ratings, the energy savings are negative since the baseline EER ratings are higher as summarized in Table 2 . Figure 6 indicates also that for a given EER rating, the energy savings are typically significantly higher for hot climates such as those of Riyadh and Dhahran than for colder climates such as that of Abha. For instance, the use of AC equipment of EER=13 rating would achieve annual energy savings of 24%, 29%, and 14% for an older villa located in respectively, Riyadh, Dhahran, and Abha. For newly constructed villas, EER=13 rated AC systems result in 18%, 23%, and 14% annual energy savings for respectively, Riyadh, Dhahran, and Abha. Figure 7 shows the savings in total energy consumption specific to various AC EER ratings when applied to the entire KSA residential building stock accounting for various regions and housing types. The results of Figure 7 confirm that replacing existing AC units with high-energy efficiency systems has a significant impact in reducing the overall energy consumption for the KSA residential building stock. As expected replacing AC units in housing units located in the middle and western regions achieve most of the potential energy savings since the majority of the population and housing units are located in these regions as noted in Figure 7 (a). Moreover, programs targeting AC replacements for villas and apartments achieve most of the energy consumption savings that other KSA housing types as indicated in Figure 7 ",

The evaluation is carried out using the bottom-up analysis approach based on the KSA residential building stock model and accounting for the number of AC systems utilized by Saudi households in various KSA regions. Table 8 esimates the potential reduction in carbon emissions associated to the electricity use savings resulting from the AC retrofit program implemented in various KSA regions. Specifically, the AC retrofit program can reduce over 13 Million Tons of CO 2 emissions annually when fully implemented. Table 9 indicates the annual electricity and carbon emission savings that occur when the existing window ACs are replaced by split units that meet SASO rating requirements (i.e., EER=11.8) for all housing units located in various KSA regions. This retrofit program can save over 20 TWh/year and 14 Million Tons/year with most of these savings occurring in the Western region where the use of window AC systems is prevalent. Table 10 shows the annual electricity savings that occur when the existing window ACs and split units are replaced by split units with high energy efficiency ratings (i.e., EER=13) for the housing stocks of various KSA regions. This specific retrofit program is currently applied in KSA with a monetary incentive of 900 SAR (i.e., USD) per AC unit [38] . As indicated in Table 10 , this program has the potential to save over 33 TWh/year with most of these savings occurring in the Western and Middle regions. Table 11 shows the savings in carbon emissions savings associated with upgrading all the AC stock to meet EER=13 rated performance level for various KSA regions. As noted in Table  11 , the program has the potential to reduce over 33 Million Tons of CO 2 emissions annually. ",

Table 12 provides a summary of these average costs based on various models commonly sold in KSA (refer to Appendices A and B). It should be noted that the current HEAC program provides a discount incentive of 900 SAR (i.e., 240 USD) per AC unit that has a rated EER of at least 13.0 [38] . The cost-effectiveness analysis results are expressed in terms of simple payback periods and summarized in Table 13 when the electricity prices charged to Saudi households is considered. As indicated in Table 13 , the simple payback periods for the three programs vary notably depending on the KSA region. The Eastern region has the lowest payback periods for all the three programs. Moreover, the program that calls for upgrading AC systems to high energy efficiency units with EER rating of 13.0 has the lowest payback period for all the regions especially when the discount incentive is applied. Indeed, with the discount of 900 SAR (i.e., 240 USD), the simple payback period for upgrading the existing AC systems to units of EER=13.0 ranges from 4.6 years for the Eastern region to 5.9 years for the Southern region. Table 14 for the regional analysis. The avoided fuel consumption results in an annual income of 3.0 USD Billion from sales using international market prices instead of the preferential prices to Saudi electricity produces as noted in Table 14 . For the KSA government, the rebate program has a simple payback period of just 2.0 years.

For a typical household, the best option would be to replace their AC systems with high efficiency split units (EER=13.0) through the HEAC initiative that provides a rebate of 900 SAR (240 USD) per AC unit. Indeed, the HEAC results in lower simple payback periods for typical Saudi households ranging from 4.6 to 5.7 years depending on the KSA region. While oil prices have recently fallen due to the global collapse in oil demand due to the corona virus, the Saudi government can recover the funds specific to the HEAC initiative in just 2 years given the domestic oil price paid by utilities is around 6 USD/barrel versus possible international prices of 60 USD/barrel.",
