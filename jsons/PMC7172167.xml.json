Clinical presentation consists of diarrhoea, poor growth and variable mortality. Intestinal disorders in pigs older than four weeks of age can be produced by several infectious agents such as rotaviruses, some coronaviruses, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Escherichia coli, Brachyspira spp., Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp., Lawsonia intracellularis, Oesophagostomum dentatum and Trichuris suis, among others. However, most cases featuring postweaning diarrhoea and colitis are due to concurrent aetiologies (Thomson and Friendship, 2012).",

These diseases are grouped under the name porcine circovirus diseases (PCVDs).

            "text": "Diarrhoea is a feature of some PCVDs and has been described in cases of PCV-SD and PCV-ED (Kim et al., 2004, Segal\u00e9s et al., 2004, Opriessnig et al., 2007). PCV2-SD occurs in pigs between one and six months of age with the highest number of cases occurring between two and three months (Segal\u00e9s and Cortey, 2010). It is a multifactorial disease, in which infection by PCV2 is essential but other factors are usually required for its complete expression (Segal\u00e9s et al., 2005, Madec et al., 2008). From a clinical point of view, there may be a potential diagnostic overlapping between PCV2-SD and PCV2-ED since diarrhoea can be easily present in cases of the systemic disease (Opriessnig et al., 2007). However, some authors have suggested that PCV2-ED could be a distinct clinical manifestation of PCV-2 (Kim et al., 2004). To differentiate between these two conditions, histopathological findings and examination not only of gut but also lymphoid tissues is crucial. PCV-SD is diagnosed when the following are present: (a) clinical signs consisting of weight loss and paleness of skin (respiratory and/or digestive clinical signs may be present as well), (b) moderate to severe lymphocyte depletion with granulomatous inflammation of lymphoid tissues or other organs, and (c) moderate to high amount of PCV2 in damaged tissues. On the other hand, PCV-ED is diagnosed when (a) pigs suffer from diarrhoea; (b) a granulomatous enteritis and lymphocyte depletion is observed microscopically in Peyer's patches, but not in other lymphoid tissues, and (c) a moderate to high amount of PCV2 is detected in intestinal mucosa or Peyer's patches without detection in other lymphoid tissues (Segal\u00e9s, 2012).",

However, the specific study of PCV2-LD in a set of 317 pigs suffering from respiratory disease, indicated that this condition is probably negligible and PCV2 mainly contributes to respiratory disease in relation to PCV2-SD occurrence (Tic\u00f3 et al., 2013). This type of assessment has not been yet conducted for PCV2-ED. Therefore, in order to clarify some points of PCV2-ED, the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of PCV2 infection in growing-to-finishing pigs with diarrhoea in Spain and assess the potential overlap between PCV-ED and PCV2-SD.",

Catarrhal enteritis or colitis (CE/CC) was consistent with serous or mucous intestinal content in the lumen and moderate to severe lymphoplasmacytic infiltration was observed microscopically within the intestinal mucosa. Granulomatous enteritis or colitis (GE/GC) was assessed when multifocal aggregates of macrophages (granulomas), with or without multinucleated giant cells or intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, and lymphoid depletion were observed in the mucosa and/or Peyer's patches. Haemorrhagic enteritis (HE) was classified when haemorrhagic content was observed in the small intestine. Fibrinous enteritis or colitis (FE/FC) consisted of accumulation of fibrin on the mucosa of caecum or colon. Ulcerative colitis (UC) was characterized by multifocal to coalescing ulceration of the large intestinal mucosa. Mucous-haemorrhagic colitis (MHC) consisted of mucous and haemorrhagic content in the caecal or colonic lumen.

Although bacteriological analyses were not performed in the studied cases, from a pathological point of view, intestinal lesions are usually related with specific infectious agents (Segal\u00e9s and Mart\u00ednez, 2013). The most prevalent intestinal lesion was catarrhal inflammation of different parts of the intestine. CE is usually associated with colibacillosis, or less frequently with yersiniosis; on the other hand, CC is generally related with the infection of some species of Brachyspira. However, other non-infectious factors, such as the composition of diet, could also be involved. Another less prevalent lesion was FE/FC which is generally associated with Salmonella spp. infections. Other type of lesion, such as HE and UC or MHC, usually associated with clostridiasis or swine dysentery, appeared in a very small number of cases. Surprisingly, only four pigs had granulomatous enteritis (highly suggestive of PCV2 infection) compared to the high rate of detection of this virus in the intestine or other organs of these animals. These findings suggest that intestinal disorders exclusively attributed to PCV2 infection in the intestine could be low, but this virus may predispose to opportunistic bacterial overgrowth or dysbacteriosis.",

Evidence of immunosupression in PCV2 infected pigs has extensively been reported in regards of several features; for example, the lymphoid depletion observed in infected pigs and the association of PCV2-SD with opportunistic pathogens (Carrasco et al., 2000, Segal\u00e9s and Mateu, 2006, Zlotowski et al., 2006). Another virus associated with immunosuppression is Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) (Zimmerman et al., 2012). In the present study, the presence of this virus in lung and lymphoid tissues was analysed by immunohistochemistry in 66 from the 96 pigs, but only 8 were positive (data not shown). In contrast, the present results showed a high prevalence of PCV2 infection in postweaning pigs with digestive disorders, reinforcing the hypothesis of altered immune response in animals infected by this virus. In this way, only a small percentage of animals corresponded to post-PCV2 vaccination period.",

            "text": "The diagnostic overlapping between PCV2-SD and PCV2-ED has been previously discussed (Opriessnig et al., 2007, Segal\u00e9s, 2012). Kim et al. (2004) proposed that PCV2-associated enteritis (equivalent to PCV2-ED) should be differentiated from PCV2-SD based on clinical and histopathological criteria. However, in the present study, most of pigs showing clinical intestinal disorders with PCV2 involvement were histopathologically diagnosed as PCV2-SD or suffered from subclinical systemic infection of the virus. Moreover, the scenario in which PCV2 was present in intestine but not in lymphoid tissues, as requested to diagnose PCV2-ED (Segal\u00e9s, 2012), did not occur in any case; so that, PCV2-ED as specific clinico-pathological entity was absent in the current study. These results coincide with those published by Tic\u00f3 et al. (2013); these authors studied the role of PCV2 associated lung disease (PCV2-LD) in cases of respiratory disease of nursery and growing-finishing pigs, but PCV2 infection exclusively restricted to the lung was not found in any case. All these results support the idea of PCV2 as a systemic pathogen, rather than virus able to cause a facultative local infection. Although, concomitant viral or bacterial agents could be present in the intestinal studied cases (worsening clinical signs), the amount of PCV2 detected in intestines was never higher than the one detected in lymphoid lesions of the same animal. Moreover, in those cases in which PCV2-ED was potentially suspected (not diagnosed as PCV2-SD), the viral load in intestinal and lymphoid tissues was lower than the amount of virus detected in PCV-SD cases. In fact, obtained findings in pigs which were non-PCV2-SD, but PCV2-infected, suggest a PCV2 systemic infection which can be interpreted as: (1) subclinical PCV-2 systemic infection, being other pathogens the major contributors of diarrhoea, or (2) recovery phase from an old PCV2-SD infection.",
