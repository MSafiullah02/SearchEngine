            "text": "Gold nanoparticle ARMS Amplification- Examples of consecutive steps of nanoparticle synthesis, ligand functionalization, and optional bio-conjugation. AuNPs of different morphologies (rod-shaped, triangular plates, but mostly spherical) can be linked to thiolated bifunctional ligands (11-mecarcaptoundecanoic acid (MUA); thiolated nickel(II) nitrilotriacetate (Ni-NTA); or singlestranded thiolated nucleic acid oligomers). Optional additional bio-conjugation can include antibodies (e.g., chemically cross-linked to MUA) or a His-tagged protein (binds to Ni-NTA) electromagnetic field of light, the AuNPs' free electrons collectively oscillate with respect to the positive metallic lattice [2] . This process is resonant at a particular frequency and is termed localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Considering AuNPs, both the electric field intensity and the scattering and absorption cross sections are strongly enhanced at the LSPR frequency, which therefore occur in the visible (Fig. 2) . Because of this, optical cross sections of metal nanoparticles (10-100 nm) are roughly five orders of magnitude larger than those of traditional organic dyes and fluorophores [2] . LSPR may be easily tuned by changing the nanostructure size, shape, composition, or environment [2, 3] (Fig. 2) . Nanodiagnostic methodologies have the ability to make molecular biological tests become faster, more sensitive, and flexible at reduced costs [4] . These new approaches can be integrated with conventional standard analytical methods, improving current techniques, and have been shown to be more sensitive and specific than conventional commercial molecular diagnostics. However, the great majority of these new systems still need further evaluation and validation with clinical samples and targets to transpose these tools from laboratory to clinic.",

Recognition events occur at the nanoscale, i. e., in a one-to-one interaction between analytes and the nanoscale structures that act as signal transducers, allowing for increased sensitivity at lower costs. Each section encompasses a set of approaches based on the nanoscale properties involved in detection, namely: (i) colorimetric sensing depending on interparticle distance, which represents the most developed approach, especially for nucleic acid detection; (ii) fluorescence quenching/enhancement properties of AuNPs; (iii) plasmonics and light-scattering properties, including detection based on surface-enhanced Raman (SERS) and LSPR spectroscopies; (iv) piezoelectric sensors using AuNPs to increase sensitivity of detection based on mass increase; and (v) electrochemical detection methods based on electrical signal enhancement or generation provided by AuNPs (summarized in Table 1 ).

The hybridization of the two Au-nanoprobes with the target resulted in the formation of a polymeric network (cross-linking mechanism), which brought AuNPs in close vicinity to cause a red to blue color change, which can readily be detected visually, or by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3b) .",

They developed a \"spot-and-read\" colorimetric detection method for the identification of DNA sequences. In this assay, the color change of DNA-modified gold probes was detected after spotting onto a glass surface illuminated by a light beam. This light-scattering method allowed detection of DNA in zeptomole quantities without signal or target DNA amplification. In comparison to the absorbance-based methods, this approach allowed a 4 order of magnitude increase in sensitivity. This way, it was possible to detect the mecA sequence gene in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus directly from genomic DNA samples. The system showed high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 66 ng/\u03bcL of DNA. Following the same approach, several groups were able to develop methods for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [9] and Cryptosporidium parvum [10] with direct detection capabilities, allowing to circumvent expensive enzymatic DNA amplification reactions. Recently, Weigum et al. developed an amplification-free molecular assay for the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts [11] . The assay targeted the C. parvum 18 s rRNA, with an LOD of 4 \u00c2 10 5 copies of RNA per \u03bcL per reaction mix. The ability to detect the C. parvum oocysts without the need for complex amplification is of utmost relevance in resource-limited settings where protozoan detection is needed the most.",

            "text": "During the last few years, several advances have been aimed at reducing the gap between light-scattering imaging and naked eye sensitivity. Earlier methods used enzymatic amplification techniques, such as PCR, asymmetric PCR, and NASBA [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Recently, Zagorovsky and Chan reported on the integration of a multicomponent DNA-responsive DNAzyme with colorimetric detection using AuNPs, allowing for nonenzymatic signal amplification [20] . This constitutes a simple and fast colorimetric approach for the detection of DNA targets of bacteria, viruses, and parasites (LOD of 50 pM). This method is also able to detect multiple sequences in parallel. The color readout discards the use of complex equipment that makes it suitable for POC assays. More recently, this same approach was used for the naked eye and direct (amplification-free) detection of Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpes virus [17] and Salmonella sp. [16] . Kalidasan Functionalized AuNPs: Non-Cross-Linking Approach Baptista and coworkers developed an inexpensive approach for the colorimetric detection of DNA sequences [21] . This method uses just one Au-nanoprobe, instead of the two required in the cross-linking method (see previous section). Detection is achieved after comparison of the solutions' color following salt addition. The presence of a complementary target does not allow nanoprobe aggregation, and the solution retains the original red color; non-complementary/mismatched targets allow gold nanoprobe aggregation, and the solution turns blue. The first clinical application of this strategy was in the rapid and sensitive detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [22] (Fig. 3c) . The gold nanoprobes were functionalized with thiol-modified oligonucleotides harboring a sequence derived from the pathogen's RNA polymerase \u03b2-subunit gene sequence. This methodology had been previously tested in clinical samples and, if associated to PCR, shows great sensitivity [21] . This protocol was further used for the rapid detection of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) members and simultaneous identification of mutations linked to antibiotic resistance [23] . LOD was determined at 75 nM. Using a set of three Au-nanoprobes based on the gyrB locus, specific identification of MTBC, M. bovis, and M. tuberculosis was easily achieved [24] . Considering application at POC, Baptista and colleagues integrated this non-cross-linking method in an optoelectronic platform (an amorphous/nanocrystalline biosensor and a light emission source) that assesses the colorimetric changes. This low-cost simple platform may be of use once integrated in a microfluidic test device for improved TB diagnostics with a tenfold reduction of reagents [25] [26] [27] . Recently, in an effort to increase sensitivity and ease of use, this detection strategy was integrated onto a paper-based platform [28] . Differential color scrutiny is captured and analyzed with a generic \"smartphone\" device to evaluate assay results and perform RGB analysis.

Liandris et al. optimized the non-crosslinking approach described above to the detection of TB without the need for target amplification [31] . The detection is based on the fact that double-and singlestranded oligonucleotides show distinct electrostatic behaviors. Hybridization leads to double-stranded DNA formation, which cannot uncoil sufficiently to expose its bases toward the Au-nanoprobe. Therefore, the Au-nanoprobe aggregates under the acidic conditions of the test. More recently, Padmavathy et al. reported on the visual direct detection of Escherichia coli without the need for nucleic acid amplification. This approach is able to detect~54 ng for unamplified genomic DNA, while reducing the overall time for detection to less than 30 min [32] . The non-cross-linking method was further applied to the identification and quantitation of RNA associated with human disease [33] . This system was successfully applied in the detection of BCR-ABL fusion gene mRNA, a hallmark for chronic myeloid leukemia [34] . This approach was capable to detect less than 100 fmol/\u03bcl of the specific RNA target (less than 10 ng/\u03bcl of total RNA). Also, the non-cross-linking approach could distinguish common-base mismatch (SNPs) within the \u03b2-globin gene [35] . The authors could detect three different individual mutations using only one Au-nanoprobe.",

Microarrays, streptavidin-biotin stripes, and lateral flow cytometer systems are usually based on this method [36, 37] . Although each method varies in the building block, all share the same principle: a DNA probe is fixed on a support in the form of stripes or spots, followed by sample DNA hybridization to the fixed probe [38] [39] [40] [41] . The second probe, consisting of AuNPs functionalized with 5 0 -thiol-modified oligonucleotides (the Au-nanoprobe), is then hybridized to a second region of the target sample DNA. Total complementarity with both probes prevents the Au-nanoprobes from being removed by washing and yields the final assay result after signal enhancement by silver deposition (Fig. 5) . Sandwich-based assays are being developed in a lateral flow strip scheme with increased sensitivity and are today a suitable alternative for the detection of PCR amplicons [37, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .",

Following target hybridization to a capture probe immobilized on the array surface, a secondary Au-nanoprobe is used for detection.

[48] with permission from Elsevier) multiplex asymmetrical PCR. This approach allowed for the simultaneous detection of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Chlamydia trachomatis. The surface immobilized 5 0 -end-amino-modified oligonucleotides, acted as capturing probes to bind the complementary biotinylated targets. Au-streptavidin conjugates specifically bind to biotin, and agglomeration was enhanced with silver for enhanced colorimetric signal. The sensitivity of this assay has been much improved by combination with silver/gold deposition to enhance light-scattering properties and further decrease detection limits, allowing visual or optical detection (e.g., image scanner). Using a similar approach, Zhao and coworkers developed a microarray platform using AuNP-based genomic microarray assay for specific identification of avian influenza virus H5N1 RNA [41] . Viral RNA was detected within 2.5 h using capture-targetintermediate hybridization, and AuNP triggered silver staining, without target amplification or any enzymatic reactions (LOD of 100 f. for purified PCR amplicons and TCID 50 units for H5N1 RNA).",

            "text": "Unmodified AuNPs have also been used for detection of DNA/RNA biomarkers [49] . These systems rely on the unspecific adsorption of biomolecules to non-functionalized AuNPs, usually profiting from the differential affinity of ssDNA and dsDNA to the AuNPs' surface. ssDNA nucleobases electrostatically interact with the citrate capped AuNPs' surface, thus stabilizing the AuNPs against higher ionic strengths. dsDNA molecules do not adsorb the same way to the AuNPs and, as such, aggregation occurs (Fig. 3a) . Griffin et al. used unmodified AuNPs for the detection and quantification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA. Their approach consists on the adsorption of a synthetic ssDNA probe complementary to the target [50] . Whenever the target is present, the ssDNA probes and target hybridize and stop being available to stabilize the AuNPs. Despite a clear colorimetric visual detection, the use of hyper-Rayleigh scattering measurement allowed for an increase in sensitivity of two orders of magnitude. Shawky et al. used the same method using clinical samples to detect the presence of HCV RNA [51] . The isolated RNA was added to a solution containing the complementary oligonucleotide probe, and after a denaturing and annealing cycle, unmodified AuNPs were added. This extremely simple and inexpensive assay, which does not include an RT-PCR step, presented a detection limit of 50 copies/reactions and exhibited a sensitivity of 92 % and a specificity of 89 %. A similar approach using an S1 nuclease to discriminate single mismatches in DNA with unmodified AuNPs was proposed, in which dNMPs adsorb to AuNPs stabilizing them further in relation to ssDNA [52] . In the presence of a mismatch between the synthetic oligonucleotide and the DNA sample, the S1 nuclease degrades ssDNA-ssRNA hybrid into its monomers (dNMPs), which increase the stability of AuNPs in solution. Also using an enzyme-mediated process, [53] tested the activity of ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. In the presence of RNase H activity RNA-DNA hybrids are formed, otherwise ssRNA remains in solution adsorbing to the AuNPs. [54] took advantage of asymmetric PCR to generate long ssDNA amplicons that stabilize AuNPs in solution after salt addition. However, if no amplification occurs, no long ssDNA amplicons are present, leading to AuNPs aggregation due to the increasing ionic strength (LOD set at 10 ng of target DNA).",

The extraordinary quenching of fluorophores by noble metal NPs prompted the development of several new approaches with remarkable sensitivity and specificity. Gold nanoprobes can take advantage of the interesting luminescent properties of AuNPs for molecular diagnostics. In fact, AuNPs can cause fluorescence enhancement or quenching of chromophores in their vicinity. Chromophores within ca. 5 nm of the surface of the AuNP have their fluorescence quenched by non-radiative pathways, while chromophores at larger distances (>10 nm) show a fluorescence enhancement of up to 100-fold [55] [56] [57] [58] . The quenching properties of AuNPs have been applied in two approaches: molecular beacons, which rely on NPs functionalized with fluorescent-labeled hairpin structures, and AuNPs nanoprobes with ssDNA that hybridize to another fluorescent-labeled ssDNA probe [59] . Molecular beacons, i.e., AuNPs functionalized with fluorescent-labeled ssDNA where the NP act as a fluorescence quencher via the NP surface energy transfer occurring between the dye (donor molecule) and the NP's surface (acceptor). On the other hand, noble metal nanoprobes rely on NPs functionalized with ssDNA hybridized to a complementary fluorescent-labeled ssDNA probe. Since ssDNA naturally adsorbs to the AuNPs, the proximity of the fluorophore with the nanoparticle is close enough for a 98 % of quenching efficiency. In the presence of a complementary target, dsDNA is formed resulting in a spatial separation of the fluorophore from the AuNPs, thus restoring the fluorescence signal (Fig. 6) .",

Two different research groups have used this approach to detect synthetic DNA of Campylobacter and HCV synthetic RNA, respectively, with single-base mismatches detection capability [50, 60] . Deng Zhang et al. used a biobarcode-type assay to obtain a fluorescence signal of PCR-amplified Salmonella enteritidis DNA [61] . In this type of assay, two types of nanoparticles are functionalized. Firstly, magnetic sulfo-SMCC-modified nanoparticles are functionalized with oligonucleotide sequence complementary to the sample DNA. Secondly, AuNPs are bi-functionalized with an oligonucleotide sequence specific for the target (in lower percentage), and another sequence that contains a nucleotide sequence 3 0 modified with a fluorophore (in higher percentage). Both nanoparticles are mixed with the sample DNA and, in case of total complementarity, the sample DNA serves has linker of both nanoparticles. After the hybridization step, a magnetic field is generated to isolate hybridized NPs from non-hybridized ones, and the thiol bonds are broken releasing the fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides (LOD of 21.5 fM). Ganbold et al. describe a similar method, but the synthetic probe is functionalized with a fluorophore whose fluorescence is quenched if the ssDNA is adsorbed to the particle but not if there is complementarity to the target [62] . Standard fluorescence signal is measured but there is also the possibility of using sub-aggregation conditions for Raman spectroscopic analysis. The method was tested with influenza A (H1N1) synthetic DNA and was able to discriminate single-base mismatches.",

The gold layer binds a higher number of ssDNA molecules to the QCM, thus increasing sensitivity.

Examples of applications in DNA detection include direct detection of AuNPs anchored onto the surface of the genosensor, conductimetric detection, and AuNPs as carriers of other AuNPs or of other electroactive labels [77] . In general, electrochemical biosensors employ potentiometric, amperometric, or impedimetric transducers. Zhang et al. described an approach that makes use of the bio-barcode method to detect DNA from Salmonella enteritidis and Bacillus anthracis in a multiplex assay where the characteristic molecular signature sequences are labeled with cadmium and lead ions, respectively [78] . Following magnetic separation, the ions are cleaved from the oligonucleotides and the square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry analyzed on screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) chips. The differential signal of both ions allows the parallel read of either DNA signature. Further signal augmentation was attained via introduction of PCR amplification and the detection limit set at 0.5 ng/mL for Cd 2+ and 50 pg/mL for Pb 2+ .",

These can either focus on the target, such as PCR or antigen concentration, or on the assay development, such as by silver enhancement. The conjugation of silver enhancement and microfluidics allows the exploitation of multiple protein and nucleic acid targets in a bio-barcode format. Nevertheless, the cost of manufacture of these microfluidic devices remains a problem, and the technology for POC use in detection protocols is still under development; thus, translation to the clinical setting remains a challenge.",
