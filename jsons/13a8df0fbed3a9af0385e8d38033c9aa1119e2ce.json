            "text": "The discovery of endogenous proteins that regulate hematopoiesis led to the identification of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, it became possible to manufacture bioactive recombinant proteins for medicinal use. Since the approval of recombinant human G-CSF (rHuG-CSF), such as filgrastim in 1991 and pegfilgrastim in 2002, millions of patients at risk for severe myelosuppression have received these products. Overall, filgrastim and pegfilgrastim have a high margin of safety for short-term use; however, rare severe adverse events have emerged and questions remain regarding the long-term safety and consequences of use of these products. This chapter primarily focuses on the safety and adverse event profile of the most widely used commercially available rHuG-CSF, Neupogen (filgrastim) and Neulasta [a modified (pegylated) filgrastim, pegfilgrastim]. As safety information can change rapidly, we suggest readers consult the latest package inserts for any changes that have occurred from the time of this writing. Other chapters in this volume discuss key studies in specific disease settings in greater detail than is the purview of this chapter, and we encourage the interested reader to reference them for further information.",

            "text": "Filgrastim is a 175-amino acid recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The filgrastim peptide has the same amino acid sequence as endogenous human G-CSF with the exception that the backbone of the molecule is not glycosylated and the N-terminus is a methionine. Endogenous human G-CSF is a lineage-specific glycoprotein and is responsible for regulation of neutrophil production in bone marrow. The lineage specificity is an important aspect of filgrastim's safety profile in that it has been shown to have a relatively consistent safety profile. Both in vivo and ex vivo studies have demonstrated the molecule acts by binding to the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) and it plays a key role in neutrophil regulation and differentiation and in neutrophil functions (i.e., respiratory burst, antibody-dependent filling, and phagocytosis) [1] [2] [3] . Exogenous rHG-CSF administration has been shown to mobilize stem cells from the marrow into the peripheral system [4] [5] [6] . Techniques have been developed to isolate and harvest stem cells from the blood in a process known as peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection.",

It is also approved for use in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are undergoing induction or consolidation chemotherapy, and in patients who are receiving myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation. Filgrastim is also approved, used to treat patients with chronic forms of neutropenia such as idiopathic neutropenia, congenital neutropenia, and cyclic neutropenia.",

The use of concomitant filgrastim was evaluated in 38 patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) receiving cyclical chemotherapy with concurrent mediastanal irradiation, and the authors reported no increase in pulmonary toxicity associated with concomitant use of filgrastim during thoracic radiation [34]; however, thrombocytopenia did occur and it is unclear if this side effect outweighs the use of filgrastim in this setting.",

Adverse events including allergic reactions and bone pain were slightly higher in the filgrastim group compared with the placebo group.

Bone marrow transplantations, both autologous and allogeneic, were first steps, but with the advent of hematopoietic growth factors, the utility of filgrastim in mobilizing PBPC for reinfusion after ablative therapy became apparent.

In rare cases, the use of these drugs has caused fatal splenic rupture and other rare but serious side effects but overall the benefit of these products has clearly outweighed the risks and has contributed to the survival of millions of cancer patients. The success of these products is an important contribution in the overall supportive care of patients receiving chemotherapy for life-threatening cancers.
