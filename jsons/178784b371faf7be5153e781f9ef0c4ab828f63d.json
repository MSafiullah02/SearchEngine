However, although it provides sufficient evidence in many of the newborns, in some patients, particularly in those with great artery-vein anomaly, it has offered limited use. Objective To demonstrate the radiological images of congenital anomalies of the aorta and vena cava within a wide spectrum obtained through multidetector computed tomography imaging (MDCT). Materials and methods The scans were performed at sections of 1-2.5 mm, reconstruction intervals of 1 mm, and a helical pitch of 1 value. mAs values for infants and young children were 50-80. Nonionic contrast media (2 ml/kg) was given with an automatic injector. Imaging was performed on axial plane after proper phase for the aorta and the vena cava was determined. After the basic images of all the patients acquired on axial plane were evaluated in detail, using special computed software and multiplanar reconstruction, maximum intensity projection, curved planar reformation, shaped surface display, and Pediatr Radiol (",

            "text": "Background Echocardiography typically used to delineate the anatomy of the pulmonary venous drainage and the septum. But sometimes it is difficult to detect the pulmonary vein confluence by echocardiography and catheter-based angiography. CT and MRI may be used to further delineate the cardiac anatomy. Several previous reports showed that CTA has some advantages when compared to other imaging modalities. On the contrary of catheter angiography, it is a non-invasive technique. In addition, it has more spatial resolution than MRI. Objective To evaluate the value of multidtector computed tomography in the diadnosis of Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return. Materials and methods A 11-year-old male was admitted to the our Paediatric Cardiology Unit for a cardiac murmur. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mild dilatation of the right atrium and the right ventricle with increased superior caval vein flow and minimum secundum atrial septal defect. This examination revealed two of four pulmonary veins draining into the left atrium. It was suspected supracardiac partial abnormal pulmonary venous return. The patient was referred to our multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) department for preoperative further evaluation of vascular abnormalities. MDCT was performed on a 64-detector-row CT scanner (Aquillon; Toshiba Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan). After scanning, we transferred the MDCT data sets to an independent workstation (Vitrea, Toshiba) for postprocessing CT angiography (CTA). Results CTA confirmed that right pulmonary veins connect to the innominate vein with subsequent drainage to the right superior vena cava and to the right atrium (Fig. 1) . These findings were confirmed at operation. Conclusion In conclusion, as the role of CTA as a imaging modality is increasing, rare congenital heart disease such as PAPVR need to be recognized on MDCT.",

Conclusion 64 detectors CT imaging modality has an important contrubution for detailed imaging of the tetralogy of fallot disease with the help of MPR and three dimentional images. volume rendering methods, images of 2 or 3 dimensions on different planes were developed. Results Based on these images, congenital aorta and vena cava anomalies and accompanying anatomic variations were clearly observed. With its volumetric imaging quality, MDCT angiography demonstrates the aorta, vena cava, and pulmonary artery and their branches. Conclusion The main diagnostic method for detection of vascular structuries is conventional angiography. Because of recent advances in CT technology, MDCT angiography has replaced conventional angiography in most clinical applications. MDCT angiography is a relatively new method and it is very useful in the diagnosis and management of congenital aorta and vena cava anomalies.",

Less than 2% of patients have the aortic arch on the same side as the absent pulmonary artery. The most frequently associated anomalies include tetralogy of Fallot or septal defects. The blood supply to the affected lung is achieved via bronchial arteries, MAPCAs, and other systemic arteries, such as intercostal and transpleural vessels. Patients with tetralogy of Fallot and unilateral absence of a pulmonary artery are a high-risk group for whom there is no consensus on the correct approach to medical management.Multidetector technology provides important information with high accuracy and specifity for anatomic details of congenital heart disease for the referring cardiologist. Objective We present the MDCT angiography findings of a 14-yearold girl who have tetralogy of Fallot with left pulmonary artery agenesis and a right-sided aortic arch. Materials and methods We performed thorax CT angiography with a 16-slice CT scanner (Lightspeed 16, GE, Wis) . Results MDCT study demonstrated unilateral left pulmonary artery agenesis. Also, elevation of the hemidiaphragm on the affected side, ipsilateral small hilum, and ipsilateral mediastinal shift were seen. CT scan confirmed the large VSD, right ventricular outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy and aortic over-ride. In addition, a rightsided aortic arch was present. Large aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) were identified arising from descendan aorta. No associated coronary anomaly was detected. Conclusion MDCT angiography is a good diagnostic modality for use in the evaluation of the congenital heart disease.",

            "text": "Vascular rings in children: CT evaluation and 3-D image superimposition Chao Jan Wang, Wan Chak Lo Chang Gung Children's Hospital Background Vascular compression on the airway in children is usually caused by the congenital anomalies of great vessels. The most common congenital anomalies associated with airway compression are the vascular rings. The emergence of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) and the advance of post-processing technology have revolutionized the imaging presentation of the congenital anomalies of pediatric airway and vascular rings. Objective To evaluate the great vessels and the tracheobronchial tree in children with congenital vascular ring by using MDCT and three dimensional image reconstruction and superimposition. Materials and methods From January 2006 to October 2008, eighteen children, 10 male and 8 female, age ranging from 1 month to 12 years, undertook CT examination under the impression of upper airway obstruction with possible vascular compression due to vascular ring. Sixteen or sixty-four slice CT scanners were used for volumetric dataset. Then all the sub-millimeter thin-slice reconstructed axial images were processed on a workstation. Multiplanar display and three-dimensional images were accomplished in every case, focusing on the relationship of the great vessels and the tracheobronchial tree. Results Vascular rings including double aortic arch, pulmonary artery sling, right-side aortic arch with Kommerell diverticulum and left-side aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery were demonstrated. Extrinsic airway compression of variable severity was well depicted by the three-dimensional superimposition images of the great vessels and the tracheobronchial tree. All had bronchoscopic correlation and some were surgically confirmed. Conclusion Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of vascular compression of the airway in children. With the advances of MDCT technology and 3D volume rendering capability, it can offer precise anatomy required for surgical planning and it may replace barium swallow, magnetic resonance and conventional angiography while dealing with cases of vascular rings.",

Case report We report a case of huge cystic anterior mediastinal mass in a 6-year-old boy with progressive substernal pain. Enhanced CT scan revealed a huge anterior mediastinal mass with homogeneous enhancement and mass effect which displaced the heart posteriorly. A histological diagnosis of lymphangiohemangioma with pericardial invasion was obtained by radical mass excision and partial pericardiectomy. Discussion Mediastinal lymphangiohemangioma, a rare hybrid tumor composed of both vascular and lymphatic components, is a rare primary mesenchymal tumor. CT is useful in the diagnosis of mediastinal lymphangiiohemangioma due to intense contrast enhancement of the intratumoral vascular spaces. Different types of enhanced patterns in CT scan, including focal areas of homogeneous, inhomogeneous enhancement or, lack of contrast enhancement were reported, and they were believed due to varying vascularity of the lesions. Although the definitive diagnosis of lymphangiohemangioma depends on histopathology, lymphangiohemangioma should be suspected in a case of a mediastinal mass with different components including well-enhanced vascular spaces and cystic appearing areas. CT is helpful to assess the extension of the tumor and the possible associated complications.",

This entity has been reported in a number of diseases such as chronic bronchitis, busulfan therapy, cystic fibrosis, congestive heart failure, myositis ossificans and idiopathic interstitial fibrosis, and usually seen in older age groups. We present a child with PO due to recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Objective To present clinical and imaging findings of a 4-year-old male with massive PO secondary to recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Materials and methods A 4-year-old male who had mental and motor retardation, epilepsy, dysfunctioning epiglottis and recurrent aspiration pneumonia was evaluated by chest radiography, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results On physical examination bilateral rales were detected. Hematological tests and sputum culture were unremarkable. Hypercapnia and hypoxemia were present. A cranial MRI, which was obtained for assessing epilepsy showed cerebral atrophy. The chest radiography revealed bilateral reticulonodular pulmonary infiltrates, patchy consolidation and pneumonic infiltrates resembling organizing pneumonia. Bilateral patchy radioopacities consistent with calcification were also noted. HRCT showed bilateral subpleural or peribronchial areas of consolidation associated with massive ossification. Conclusion Recurrent aspiration pneumonia may result in extensive PO in children; however, more cases are necessary to be able to conclude whether this finding has prognostic and therapeutic implications. Background A wide spectrum of congenital abnormalities of the aortic arch and its branches can occur due to the failure of fusion or regression of the vascular arches. These abnormalities can cause symptoms of like stridor, dyspnoea, dysphagia and cyanosis due to the compression of trachea or oesophagus. Objective To review the normal embryology of the aortic arch.

Objective Our aim is to highlight the role of CXR in diagnosis and follow-up of children with pneumonia. Materials and methods In a six month period, 47 children with pneumonia, aged 30 days to14 years, (median age 4,5 years) were hospitalized in our department. We recorded the clinical severity and the duration of symptoms and we correlated them with CXR findings. All children had at least one CXR upon admission. Recurring CXRs were obtained according to clinical criteria. Results 14 children (30%) were admitted the day symptoms appeared, 29 children (62%) 2-5 days later, while 4(8%) had symptoms for more than 5 days before hospitalization. Tweenty children (42,5%) presented severe symptoms and admission CRX demonstrated lobar (4/20) or segmental consolidation (16/20). 27 patients (57,5%) with segmental consolidation presented minor clinical symptoms. Thirty-four children (72%) had a recurring CXR during hospitalization. Most of the 2nd CXRs (74%) were obtained on the 4th-8th day of hospitalization, and only one case did not reveal improvement. CXRs obtained before the 4th day of hospitalization showed no improvement in 4 out of 5 patients. The majority of patients (89%) showed signs of recovery between the 2nd and 4th day of hospitalization. Recovery was confirmed with a 2nd CXR for 29 patients (91%) while in 3, 2nd CXR did not reveal signs of improvement. CXR of patients with persistent symptoms confirmed stability. 3rd CXR was obtained in only 3 children with continuing signs of pneumonia or complications(empyema). Conclusion Plain chest x-ray is a reliable tool for the evaluation of pediatric patients with pneumonia. Upon admission, CRX findings reliably confirm severity of clinical signs. In the majority of cases a 2nd CXR, confirms recovery when performed on the 4th-8th day of hospitalization. A 3rd CXR is necessary when complications are encountered.",

Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed 64 MDCT studies performed in children (< 18 years old) who underwent MDCT studies for evaluation of underlying intra and extracardiac congenital heart disease from July 2004 to December 2008 at our institution. Pediatric patient preparation, MDCT scanning parameters with emphasis on low radiation dose technique, and 2D/3D postprocessing reconstruction techniques were investigated in detail. Cases with central airway anomalies / abnormalities were collected and illustrative cases with particular emphasis on their 2D and 3D imaging appearances are presented. Results A wide spectrum of concomitant central airway anomalies / abnormalities was identified in pediatric patients with underlying congenital heart disease. Intrinsic central airway anomalies / abnormalities include tracheal stenosis, anomalous bronchial branching pattern (e.g., tracheal bronchus, cardiac bronchus) and tracheobronchomalacia. Extrinsic central airway anomalies / abnormalities include vascular rings and sling, as well as extrinsic central airway compression secondary to adjacent dilated pulmonary vessels, abnormal position of the aorta, and cardiomegaly. Conclusion The advent of 64 Slice MDCT has played a major role as a non-invasive imaging tool for evaluating central airway anomalies / abnormalities in pediatric patients with underlying congenital heart disease.

Objective The purpose of this presentation is to review the role of thoracic imaging in children with systemic disorders. Examination techniques and specific systemic conditions with thoracic manifestations will be discussed. Materials and methods During the last 6 years we review 3,000 patients with systemic disease. The most frequent radiological examination techniques were Chest X-ray/CR, Computed Tomography and Nuclear medicine, following by MRI in some cases. Low-dose techniques have been applied to both helical CT and high-resolution CT (HRCT). Results Plain radiographs/CR remain the fist most common thoracic imaging study. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary crosssectional imaging modality used to evaluate all thoracic components due to its increased sensitivity and specificity compared to chest radiography. CT may be used either to better evaluate radiographic abnormalities or to assess the presence and extent of a suspected systemic disease. HRCT is the method of choice for the evaluation of diffuse parenchymal disease. Evaluation of the mediastinum and chest wall should be performed with helical CT. MRI is better in evaluating the chest wall or in demonstrating soft tissue inflammation and rib bone marrow changes compared to CT. Nuclear medicine can add functional information to the morphological information provided by CT and MRI.The systemic diseases in children includes the connective tissue diseases, immunodeficiency and immunodeficiency syndromes, chronic granulomatous disease, Langerhans\u00b4s cell histiocitosis, cystic fibrosis, immotile cilia syndrome, vasculitis, etc. Conclusion Chest radiograph underestimates the detection and extent of lung disease in systemic diseases. HRCT detect, characterize and determine the extent of the interstitial and alveolar disease. Early recognition of disease will lead to prompt treatment that can be beneficial in preventing and improving progression of the disease. Objective To describe CT findings of a rare venous anomaly and tracheal stenosis in a newborn baby. Materials and methods A baby boy was born at the gestational age of 39 weeks and 1 day weighing 3,104 g. He was presented with mild grunting soon after birth. The peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 84-93%, despite oxygen administration through nasal cannulae. He was mildly cyanotic, however tachypnea and retraction were not observed. Echocardiography revealed PLSVC, atrial septal defect or persistent foramen ovale. No other cardiac anomaly could be obtained. No abnormal findings were demonstrated on chest radiograph. However SpO2 did not improve. For this unexplained hypoxemia, chest CT was performed on day 7. Results Enhanced CT showed PLSVC draining into LA. Right SVC was absent. This venous anomaly leads to right-to-left shunt, and accounts for hypoxemia. Contrast echocardiography confirmed this anomaly. He underwent surgical treatment which was successful. At the age of nine months, recurrent stridor occurred. Tracheal stenosis was revealed on CT. Conclusion We report the newborn baby with PLSVC draining into LA with absent right SVC and associated tracheal stenosis diagnosed by enhanced CT. CT clearly demonstrated this rare congenital systemic venous anomaly, and was very useful in the initial evaluation of unexplained hypoxemia.",

The diagnosis may be difficult to establish with numerous associated anomalies that can resemble or overlap other pathologic conditions. Some anomalies may be too subtle to recognize prenatally. Successful postnatal radiologic assessment requires an understanding of the complexities of these various anomalies. Objective In light of the numerous anomalies and variable prognosis of VACTERL association, timely and accurate diagnosis for appropriate management and follow-up is important. The prenatal and postnatal radiologic evaluation of VACTERL association will be presented. Materials and methods Retrospective review of prenatal and postnatal imaging findings in patients with VACTERL association from January 1998 July 2008 was performed. Prenatal evaluation by US and MRI as well as postnatal evaluation by X-ray, fluoroscopy, CT, US, MRI and nuclear medicine was reviewed. Results Prenatal US was particularly useful in the assessment of cardiac, renal, cleft lip and skeletal anomalies. Fetal MRI was helpful at times for the assessment of anal atresia, cranial anomalies and pulmonary agenesis. Both modalities were useful in diagnosing 2 vessel cord and duodenal atresia. Both MRI and US were limited in the assessment of TE fistula, tethered cord and some vertebral anomalies prenatally.",

A Colour Doppler indicated a solid, well circumscribed hypoechoic mass with a flow pattern atypical of haemangioma. The Doppler spectrum showed arterial flow characterised by low-flow velocity. A MRI confirmed the absence of intracranial connections of the tumor, which appeared less hypervascular than haemangioma on post contrast sequences. The tumor was completely resected at the age of 5 months, via an extranasal approach. The histopathological diagnosis was nasal glioma. Conclusion US with Doppler analysis and MRI are fundamental to differentiate nasal glioma from encephalocele and haemangioma, and to plan the correct surgical approach.",

Such diagnosis is based on sonographic screening. MRI, however, can provide more accurate findings including dilated bowel signal intensity and the demonstration of the bowel distal to the atresia. Objective To assess the findings of fetal MRI for evaluating the level of intestinal atresia. Materials and methods The subjects comprised 24 fetuses (18-36 weeks? gestation), including esophageal atresia (n=12), gastric obstruction (n=1),duodenal atresia (n=9), jejunal atresia (n=2), leal atresia (n=1). Nine of the fetuses with esophageal atreis had multiple anomalies including other parts of the intestinal anomalies. After obtaining informed consent, the pregnant women underwent MRI, which was performed with a 1.5-T super conductive unit (Siemens Magnetom Vision or Symphony) using a phased-array coil. No premedicaion was given for the examinations. Half-Fourier singleshot turbo spin-echo, T2-weighted (T2-W) sequences and T1weighted (T1-W) fast gradient-echo sequences.T2-W and T1-W sequences were performed in sagittal, coronal, and often axial plans. Imagings were reviewed by a pediatric radiologist. The MR findings and suggested diagnoses were compared with the results of neonatal evaluation( clinical history, imaging data, intraoperative constitution, and pathologic examination). Results Esophageal atreisa type A and duodenal atreia were easy to diagnose. However MRI provided complete diagnosis of small bowel atresia, and identified the level of obstruction in 50% of cases. In multiple level of bowel atresia, only one level of obstruction was indentifined in this study. Conclusion MRI is useful for the diagnosis of intestinal atresia in fetuses. Recognition of the bowel distal to the atresia is an important diagnostic finding especially in small bowel atresia. At present, it is difficult to prenatally diagnose esophageal atresia type C.",

Objective The migration of an ingested foreign body into solid organs such as liver or pancreas is rarely reported. The aim of this study is to emphasize the importance of radiological imaging in a 15 year old girl with a hepatic foreign body which is diagnosed incidentally. Materials and methods The patient is evaluated with direct roentgenogram, abdominal sonography and computed tomography (CT). Results A 15 year old girl applied to emergency room with complaint of abdominal pain. Although the patient history did not reveal any ingestion of foreign body, a lineer opacity compatible with a sewing needle in right hypochondrium was observed on upright direct roentgenogram. On abdominal sonography, a lineer echogenity (sewing needle) in segment 6 of the liver was visualised with surrounding parenchymal hypoechoic areas corresponding to inflammatory changes. On following CT scan, the diagnosis of sewing needle and surrounding foci of abscesses were confirmed. Conclusion The migration of an ingested foreign body into the liver by perforating the small bowel is a rare situation. It should be kept in mind, as in our case, pediatric patients may be aware of foreign body ingestion. In such cases, the only way of diagnosis may be radiological imaging such as roentgenogram, abdominal sonography, or CT. Background It is usually a challenge for pediatric radiologists and clinicians to decide wether the patients with intussusceptions should be performed repeated air reduction or get operation directly after they were failed in the first air enema.

Results 343 children with intussusceptions were involved in our study and all of them were performed air enema initially. Reduction rate with first air enema was 80.76% (227/343). Delayed reduction attempts were used in 49 patients (14.29%) and were successful in 61.22% (30/49). Total reduction rate was 89.5%. Furthermore, the clinical and radiological data of different group, with success of delayed attempts and failure of delayed attempts, were compared statistically. There were significant differences between the two groups in the presence of obstruction of the small intestine on plain films (P=0.049, <0.05), the initial position of the apex of the intussusception (P=0.023, <0.05), the position of the apex of intussusception at the end of first air reduction (P= 0.003, <0.01) and the position of the apex of intussusception when the pressure was released after the first reduction (P=0.005, <0.01). Conclusion Air enema associated with the use of delayed, repeated reduction attempts is an effective approach for intussusception reduction with high successful rate.

Materials and methods A 7 year old boy was admitted to our hospital with a history of 2,5 year recurrent fever, every 20-30 days, of short duration 3-4 days, and with no other symptoms. During the episodes mild anemia and neutropenia were also identified. The child was referred to our depertment for sonographic evaluation of liver enlargement. Results The left liver lobe was diffusely hypoechogenic with textural disorganization and scattered microcalcifications. Intense hyperechogenic areas in the subphrenic liver surface and around the gallbladder were shown, as in fibrosis.The right lobe was enlarged with normal architecture. The left portal vein had small diameter with small vessels distally, as in cavernous transformation, possibly due to previous thrombosis. The CT scan and the abdominal MRI revealed the same findings in regard with the portal vein and moreover, multiple solid lesions along the subphrenic surface of the left liver lobe with imaging characteristics of lymph nodes. Inflammation was considered the most possible diagnosis, although the specific etiology could not be suggested. Laparotomy and microscopic examination that followed verified the inflammatory nature of the lesion. Conclusion Based on our experience with this child and according to the literature, the imaging findings of inflammatory pseudotumor are no specific and histologic examination after percutaneous biopsy or surgical procedure is necessary.

Materials and methods From January 2008 to June 2008, 14 neonates (eight girls and six boys) were diagnosed with NEC in the neonatal intensive care of our hospital. Five of them were premature and nine were fullterm babies. Eleven were delivered with ceasarectomy and three with normal delivery. The symptoms were abdominal distention and bloody stools. Plain abdominal radiography was performed in all patients and sonography in four of them. The timing of follow up plain abdominal radiographs and abdominal US depended of the severity of NEC. Results Plain abdominal radiography revealed bowel distension with intramural air in 8 neonates, in 1 bowel distension with intramural air and air in the portal vein. In 5 neonates the abdominal radiography was normal. Bowel wall thickness was established with sonography in 2 neonates, portal vein gas and intramural air in 1 and in 1 portal vein gas, intramural air, bowel wall thickening and intraperitoneal fluid. Plain abdominal radiography was performed before the sonography. When plain abdominal radiography was abdnormal, US was abnormal as well. Conclusion Plain Abdominal radiography is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of NEC, while abdominal US provides direct images of the abdominal structures, particularly the bowel and the presence of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. In these series portal vein gas and intramular air did not always proved to be ominous signs as some of the neonates with these signs were treated conservatively and had a favourable outcome. Objective The aim of this study is to present, four neonates with bowel obstruction (BO) caused by GDC, to emphasize on imaging findings in different diagnostic procedures and to highlight on the role of ultrasonography (US).",

In two patients a barium enema (BE) was performed, one of them also underwent a barium meal (BM) examination. US with high frequency convex and linear transducers was performed in all cases. Results In all patients plain film indicated that an obstruction was at the proximity of the ileocecal junction. The BE in one patient confirmed the level of the obstruction while being inconclusive in the second. This patient underwent a BM that indicated an obstruction at the ileocecal junction. In all patients US revealed well defined, unilocular cystic lesions, measuring from 1,5 to 5 cm, with an anechoic content (3/4) or containing echogenic material (1/4). They were all located in the right lower abdomen. Their wall was evaluated; three layers were identified in one patient, two layers in two cases while one presented a thickened, without distinct layers, wall. Associated findings included ileum wall thickening proximal to the lesion (1/4).The diagnosis of GDC was evocated in all cases and confirmed at surgery. Conclusion GDCs may cause BO in neonatal period. US confirms the diagnosis of BO and can show the level and the cause of obstruction. A cystic nature and a distinct layer wall are highly suggestive of GDC, however, final diagnosis is always pending on microscopic features. Barium studies are probably unnecessary and should be reserved for selected cases. Background Nutcracker phenomenon is defined as compression of the left renal vein between abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery (SMA). It is an uncommon event and the underlying cause is not yet known. While this phenomenon frequently presents as an asymptomatic condition, it may cause abdominal pain, proteinuria, hematuria, or flank pain. Objective Evaluation of nutcracker phenomenon based on Doppler US and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) findings of 2 cases. Nutcracker phenomenon is diagnosed by radiologic results and laboratory tests eliminating the hematuria causes. The angle between abdominal aorta and SMA is less than 90\u00b0and consequently left renal vein is entrapped and compressed between those 2 structures. Beyond the compression level, left renal vein shows dilatation. In this condition, compressed left renal vein may cause renal venous hypertension followed by left ureteral and gonadal varices. Materials and methods The two cases, 7 and 16 year-old, were presented with left flank pain. There was no clinical indication of urinary tract infection. Proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were detected in the urinalysis. CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Creactive protein, coagulation profile, and selective urine cytology were normal. Renal US, renal Doppler US, and MRA studies were performed. Results Renal US revealed normal sized left kidney and distinct cortex-medulla boundary. No nephrocalcinosis was found. Doppler US and MRA studies showed superior mesenteric artery as seperating from abdominal aorta by a considerably acute angle in both of the cases. Consequently, left renal vein was appearing to be compressed between abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery while demonstrating a dilatation after that point. Diagnosis was established based on the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic results. Conclusion Nutcracker phenomenon should be considered following elimination of other differential diagnoses in cases presenting with nonspecific abdominal pain alongside proteinuria and hematuria for which Doppler US and MRA provide supportive findings.",

The multicystic dysplastic kidney can be unilateral, bilateral or segmental and probably results from atresia of the ureteral bud system during embryogenesis. We present the prenatal MRI and US findings of an atypical and giant multicystic dysplastic kidney. A 37-year-old woman, gravida 3, parity 2, underwent prenatal sonography examination at the 24 week's gestation. The size, contour and texture of the right kidney were normal on sonography. However, on the left side, a giant multilocular and multiseptated cystic lesion was detected. The lesion occupied the left kidney location also extended up to the diaphragm in the cranial direction. No kidney parenchyma was observed inside the lesion. The initial interpretation of the perinatologist was multicystic dysplastic kidney. For these findings to be evaluated further and to be validated, prenatal MRI was performed at 25 week's of gestation. The mother was in a supine position for the examination, and the images were acquired during maximal inspiration. The fetal urogenital system was examined in sagittal, transverse, and coronal orientations using a T2weighted sequence (HASTE; TR/TE, 1,380/103; field of view, 250 mm; slice thickness, 4 mm; matrix, 256\u00d7256; number of excitations, 1). In MR images, the left kidney could not be identified. A giant multilocular and multiseptated cystic lesion was detected on the left side.The size and contour of the right kidney was normal. MRI findings of the cystic mass suggested multicystic dysplastic kidney and cystic lymphangioma. There were no accompanying congenital anomalies.",

Materials and methods A male born after 38 weeks gestation after normal first pregnancy and vaginal delivery in premature rupture of membranes (PROM), presented with edema, thickness and purplish discolouration of the left hemiscrotum; the testis was mobile and the right side scrotal skin normal. Results Ultrasonography (US) showed scrotal soft tissue edema and difficoult identification of the vascularization. For the clinical suspicion of testicular torsion was performed a left surgical exploration that excluded complicated hernia and testicular torsion but a large scrotal hematoma extending until the groin was found with blood within the spermatic cord and tunica vaginalis. Postoperative abdominal US showed a right suprarenal mass hemorrhage (39\u00d7 25 mm) without peritoneal or retroperitoneal blood collection. US 3months follow up (once a month) showed a gradual decresing of the adrenal hematoma. Conclusion Adrenal hemorrhage is generally associated with perinatal hypoxia but spontaneous occurrence is nor rare. The right side is more often involved. Clinical presentation is various, depending on the volume of blood coming out. If the blood goes down into the retroperitoneal space it can descend into the groin and presenting as a scrotal swelling. Although the adrenal hemmorrhage is a condition relatively common in newborn, only 20 cases with scrotal hematoma have been described so far and to our knowledge this is the first case with controlateral scrotal hematoma prentation. Adrenal haemorrhage should be considered as a possible cause of acute scrotal swelling in neonates. Ultrasonography assessment should be performed to examine the intra-abdominal organs especially the adrenal glands, to find out an adrenal hemmorrhage and avoid an unnecessary scrotal surgical exploration.",

When a pathologic change of the testis is detected, it is important, if possible, to make a correct diagnosis in order to enable an appropriate treatment decision. Objective In children, testicular enlargement can be caused by cyctic dysplasia of the testis (CDT), a rare congenital condition. As CDT has a rather characteristic US appearance and can be diagnosed by US only, we decided to present US findings in two cases to help in recognising this entity, and to report on treatment decisions. Materials and methods Two boys, a 2-month-old infant and a 2-yearold boy, with slight unilateral testicular enlargement were investigated by high resolution US and with flow Doppler of the testes, and by abdominal US. Results In both boys, US of the affected testis demonstrated enlargement and pathologic testicular structure, in the infant located dorsally, occupying half of the testis, in the boy in the central region, occupying less than half of the testis. The pathologic structures were rather well defined and consisted of multiple, small, anechoic, cystic structures with lack of flow signal. The diagnosis was CDT in both boys. Abdominal US of the 2-year-boy revealed ipsilateral renal agenesis. The infant had surgery with partial resection of the testis; the diagnosis of CDT was conformed. For the older boy it was decided to do follow up by US only. Conclusion Testicular enlargement can be caused by CDT, a rare congenital condition, which can be associated with ipsilateral renal agenesis or dysplasia. It has a rather specific US appearance with no flow signal and can thus be correctly diagnosed by high resolution US with Doppler flow. The diagnosis enables a correct treatment decision. Background To present similar two cases of testicular fibrosis due to undiagnosed testicular torsion. The first case was a12-year-old male, who was referred to our sonography division for small testis suspicious. In ultrasound(US) left testis was small and tunica albuginea was thick and hyperechogenic. After orchiectomia, histopathologic exam revealed ischemic necrosis and fibrosis, consistent with testicular torsion The second case was a 13-years-old male; he underwent US study two weeks after scrotal pain and swelling. First US study showed heterogenous epididymis and testis on the right side without focal mass. Repeated US scan two months after the symptoms showed hyperechogenic tunica albuginea suggesting fibrosis similar to first case Both cases were showing decreased testicular dimension and hyperechogenic, thick tunica albuginea resembling calcification. But the x-ray graphies did not confirm calcification.Tunica albuginea fibrosis and small testis can be a sequel of subclinic testicular torsion.",

It mostly represents an incidental finding during routine scrotal sonography, but it can be associated with several conditions, such as cryptorchidism, gonadal dysgenesis and alveolar microlithiasis. The coexistence of testicular germ cell tumors and the occurrence of malignant processes have raised the suspicion of being a premalignant lesion in adults. Objective To assess the typical sonographic appearance of this condition and its significance.

We found the typical sonographic pattern with variably extending multiple parenchymal non-shadowing echogenic small foci, evenly distributed or in peripheral clusters. Sonographic follow-up did not put into evidence the onset of neoplasms in our series. Also tumoral markers (CEA, beta HCG, alfa-feto protein) were within normal ranges. Conclusion Testicular microlithiasis, variably involving the parenchyma, can easily be recognized on US examination. Although no tumoral lesions have been detected in our pediatric series, in accordance with literature data, some aspects still need further investigation and larger population and longer control periods might be necessary. Objective The aim of this study was to estimate the correlation between mean normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and split renal functions determined by renal scintigraphy. Materials and methods This retrospective study included 20 children (12 male, 8 female, age range 10 months-13 years) with suspected obstructive uropathy. All patients underwent an MR examination on one of two different 1.5-T systems. We measured the renal parenchymal and paraspinal muscle ADC values and correlate mean normalized ADC values with split renal functions. We used Mann-Whitney U Test for statistical analysis. Results We found that the mean normalized ADC values of normal functioning kidneys in the same individual were similar. On the other hand, the differences between mean normalized ADC values of each kidney, in the same individual with functionally differing kidneys, were statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusion These results indicated that measurement of mean normalized ADC has a potential value in the evaluation of the functional status of renal parenchyma.",

It is mostly an occasional finding, which can be recognized for the caudal position of the epididymal head. No changes of the gonadal volume and echotexture are expected. Objective To assess the role of ultrasonography in the identification of this uncommon gonadal malposition. Materials and methods We describe sonographic and color-Doppler findings in 4 patients, ranging from 16 to 18 years of age, complaining about some recurrent scrotal troubles, exacerbating during intense physical activity. On physical examination the testes presented normal volume, consistency and mobility, and the cremasteric reflex was present. Results Sonography confirmed normal-sized, symmetrical testes, with homogeneous parenchymal echotexture. Color-Doppler demonstrated normal intraparenchymal flow. However, the left testis had a peculiar malposition with the epididymal head lying at the bottom of the scrotal sac, and the epididymal tail, with the spermatic vessels, at the top. Because of the vertical inversion of the testis, spermatic vessels were somewhat stretched, but flow was preserved. Low grade varicocele and a small amount of hydrocele were present in 2 out of 4 patients. Conclusion Testicular malposition could be brought on by the absence of the scrotal ligament, due to a developmental anomaly of the gubernaculum testis, which is responsible for gonadal fixation at the bottom of the scrotal sac. Moreover, also a mesorchium relaxation could be responsible for an excessive mobility of the testis in the scrotum, while a greater length of the spermatic cord avoiding a severe kinking of the vessels, could warrant blood supply to the gonad. Two of our patients underwent corrective surgery with normal repositioning of the testis, which was then fixed at the bottom of the scrotum. Sonographic recognition of this anomaly is rather simple and may be an occasional finding, although the abnormal epididymal position could be clinically suspected, on the basis of a correct anamnesis.",

Both urinoma and urinary ascites can be associated with obstructed urinary outflow, such as ureteropelvic junction obstruction and neonatal posterior urethral valves and are related with protected fetal and neonatal renal function, thanks to the so called \"pop-off\" valve mechanism, that prevents high intravesical pressures with transmittance to the upper urinary tract, which is an hypothesized cause of the development of renal insufficiency. Objective To assess the role of imaging in the recognition of this uncommon urethral obstruction. Materials and methods We report the case of a 2-month-old baby with unremarkable prenatal diagnosis, presenting with sudden onset of febrile urinary tract infection, macroscopic haematuria, and failure to thrive. No reports on micturition characters are given. Results Abdominal sonography revealed a voluminous subcapsular septated collection surrounding the left kidney, which showed a deep scar in the outer surface, widely communicating with the external collection. Bladder wall were slightly thickened. MRI confirmed the extrarenal collection, with fluid presenting intermediate characteristics between urine and blood. Voiding cystourethrography demonstrated the caliceal leak of contrast in the subcapsular and perirenal space. The syringocele appeared as a sort of diverticulum of the bulbar urethra, filling with contrast during the incomplete micturition, bladder only slightly emptying. Conclusion Syringocele represents a congenital or acquired dilatation of Cowper's ducts. Cowper's bulbo-urethral glands, homologous to Bartolini's glands in females, are located between the layers of the urogenital diaphragm and in the spongiosus body, along the bulbar urethra, and their ducts open directly into the urethra. Syringocele may cause hydronephrosis in utero. In the newborn there may be severe obstruction, often followed by renal function deterioration, as in presence of posterior urethral valves. In our case, the \"pop-off\" mechanism related with the perirenal urinoma guaranteed decompression of the upper urinary tract and preservation of renal function. Endoscopic and/or surgical treatment allows restoration of the normal anatomy.",

Objective Our aim is to describe CT urography (CTU) technique with its basic principles and modifications for pediatric age group, discuss advantages and disadvantages of the technique and to demonstrate various examples from different age groups of pediatric population. Materials and methods Between May 2003 and December 2008, 25 patients referred for CT urography to radiology department were included. CTU protocole consists of non-contrast (precontrast (3 mm slice thickness); nephrographic (scanned at 80 s with 10 mm slice thickness) and excretion phases (scanned at 15 min. with 3 mm slice thickness) which were modified depending on the clinical information to avoid excessive radiation risk. Whole urinary system (kidneyureter-bladder) were included in non-contrast and excretion phases while only kidneys are included for the nephrographic phase. Results Uni-/bilateral ureteropelvic junction stenosis (n=5), nonfunctioning kidney (n=1), nephrolithiasis (n=6), ureterolithiasis (n=3), ectopic kidney (n=1), double collecting system (n=2), hypoplastic kidney with extrarenal pelvis (n=1), pelvicalyceal dilatation (n=4), renal agenesis (n=1), sacral agenesis (n=1) were detected. Conclusion The main principle for pediatric CTU should be 'every case needs individual care and modification of the protocole'.

Materials and methods Eighteen patients aged between 8 months and 15 years with sonograhically detectable ureteral stones were included. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed initially. The diagnosis of urolithiasis was confirmed by spontaneous discharge of stones, IVP, surgical procedures or clinical follow-up. A total of 12 males and 6 females with a mean age of 8.7 years underwent abdominal sonography examination with 3-3.5 MHz convex and 7.5-8 MHz lineer probes. Detection of hyperechogenic structure with little or prominent posterior acustic shadowing in a dilated ureter lumen was accepted as diagnostic criteria for ureteral stone. Results In 14 patients (78%), stones were located in distal ureter lumen, whereas in 4 patients (22%) they were located in proximal ureter lumen. In 9 cases (50%) ureteral stones were on the right side and in 9 cases (50%)were on the left. The diameter of the smallest ureteral stone was measures as 2.4 mm and of the largest one was measured as 8.3 mm (mean diameter of ureteral stones was 5 mm).",

Ct image guided CNB is an acute and safe diagnostic procedure in evaluating bone lesions in children, especially those in areas of diagnostic difficulty. Materials and methods The total number of patients included in this retrospective study was 42. The mean age was 8 years, with a range of 2-14 years. For the whole series there were patients with lesions of the shoulder, pelvis, iliac, cervical spine, lumbar spine, thoracic spine and femoral bone. All biopsies were performed under sedation. The bone tissue was obtained using cutting trocar system 14G with a needle of 18G. Results Adequate diagnostic histological material was obtained in 38 out of 42 patients of our cases (90.4%). Four of our patients underwent the procedure for a second time in order to get adequate material for the diagnosis. The histological findings were in 6 patients osteosarcoma, 4 chondrosarcoma, 4 chondroblastoma, 5 lymphoma, 6 istiocytossis, 5 tuberculosis spondilitis, 8 staphylococcal spondilitis. One patient had a small osteoid osteoma of the cotyle, in this case we managed not only to take a tissue sample but to remove the whole nidus. None of our patients had any major complications. Conclusion CT image guided percutaneous CNB of bone lesions is a diagnostically helpful, effective, secure, minimally invasive procedure that can be performed in children. The benefit is more obvious when the lesion is deep seated in the pelvis or spine or very closely related to the neurovascular structure.",

Objective We present a review of GJ placement in children less than 12 months old, in whom severe comorbidities precluded a surgical or endoscopic procedure. We review the technique and evaluate the efficacy of the procedure and associated complications. Materials and methods The medical records and imaging were reviewed in all infants who had a primary radiologic GJ tube placement in a 2 year period. The underlying condition and indication for placement was noted. The technique and the catheter used was also documented. Finally, immediate and long-term outcomes were assessed, including major and minor complications. Results There were 14 infants (6 m, 8 f). The mean age was 4.1 m and the mean weight was 4.2 kg. The primary diagnosis was prematurity with feeding difficulties in 4, complex cardiac disease in 4, neurodevelopmental disorder in 2, respiratory compromise in 2 and GI disorder in 2. The indication was reflux/aspiration in all and poor feeding in 6. A 8.5 F Cook or 10 F Carey-Alzate catheter was used. Mean follow-up period was 16.8 months. One patient died from the underlying cause unrelated to the procedure. The other 13 patients (93%) had a functioning GJ tube at the end of the follow up periods. These 13 patients gained weight along the normal growth curve. There were no major or intra-procedural complications. Minor complications included a leak around the tube in 3 patients (21%), skin erythema in 3 (21%), displacement of the catheter (43%) in 6 and granulation at the skin insertion site in 2 (14%).

Percutaneous aspiration alone is only transiently effective. The combination of aspiration and sclerotherapy has provided good results. Objective We review the treatment of symptomatic solitary hepatic cysts in childhood and described a pediatric case of benign hepatic cyst successfully treated by the instillation of tetracycline hydrochloride (HCL). Materials and methods A 11 years old boy was admitted to our pediatric hospital for abdominal pain. Ultrasound and MRI scans showed a large solitary hepatic cyst of 5.2\u00d76.2\u00d79.4 cm (volume 160 cc) in the posterior liver segment. The cyst was punctured with a 21-gauge Chiba needle under at real-time US imaging. After aspiration of 10 cc of the cyst content, the cyst was opacified by injecting the same volume of iomeprol, a non ionic contrast agent, under fluoroscopic guide to check for the absence of communication between the cyst and the biliary tree and to test for the absence of leak into the peritoneal cavity. After that 200 mg of tetracycline HCL solution (5%) was injected into the cystic cavity and wasn't aspirated before needle removal. This injection was performed only once. Results Complete regression was found at 3 months US and MR examination with total collapse of the cyst. No immediate or late complications occurred and the patient have remained symptom free. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case reported in literature where a solitary liver cyst was treated with sclerotherapy using tetracycline HCL. We propose that injection of tetracycline HCL is in pediatric patients an efficient and safe treatment with short hospitalization.",

After the puncture of the 3 cm parapelvic cyst with 20 G Chiba needle under ultrasonographic guidance; cystogram was obtained to evaluate the communication with the pelvicalyceal system and retroperitoneal extravasation. Then 95% ethanol of 30-40% of the initial cyst volume, as the sclerosing agent, was injected into the cystic cavity. The ethanol was left into the cavity for 10 min to destroy cyst epithelium.

Discussion The parapelvic renal cysts are originated from renal parenchyma and lying down to the renal hilus. Most are asymptomatic but if a parapelvic cyst becomes symptomatic, the treatment is necessary. Percutaneous drainage and ethanol sclerotherahy is performed mainly in cortical cysts.

These include dentigerous cyst, odontogenic keratocysts, calcifying odontogenic cyst, ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenenic tumor and ossifying fibroma. All the cases were confirmed on histology. Modalities for diagnosing these lesions include dental intraoral x-rays, orthopantomography (OPG) and computed tomography (CT) scans. CT scanning is helpful for very large lesions and to determine if bone is eroded by lesion. In our cases, some of these lesions were depicted on dental intraoral radiographs and orthopanthomography while CT was performed on some cases. Several studies were done previously to characterize and differentiate various cystic lesions and tumors in dental and maxillomandibular region based on the radiological features. However no conclusive information has been made to allow accurate diagnosis based only on radiological features. The aim of these pictorial illustrations is to highlight various radiological appearances of such lesions as in some centers the radiographs are usually seen only by the oral surgeons. Background There are about 300 lymph nodes in the neck. All of them can be easily examined with ultrasonography (US). Similar to the other ones, neck lymph nodes also can enlarge abnormally due to different causes (enfectious, inflamatory or neoplastic). Sometimes reactivated neck lymph nodes in the pediatric population may loose their normal central fatty echogenity. In this instance, size can be the most important parameter to establish the abnormal node(s). Regretfully saying, we couldn't found any other study in the literature that has mentioned the normal sizes of the neck lymph nodes in normal pediatric population. Objective The purpose of this prospective study was to measure the cervical lymph node sizes in normal pediatric cases and to present a scale for guiding sonographist. Materials and methods A total 104 patients were included (mean age 9.4 years, m:63, F:41) in study. Complete blood count and routine biochemistry of the patients were also done. At the ultrasound examinations, using the high resolution lineary transducer, the shortest and then the longest axis diameters of the lymph nodes of the neck are measured electronically. Results All patients were normal to the physical examination. Routine labratory studies were all changing in normal ranges. The mean diameters of the neck lymph nodes according to the nodal classification schema (levels, respectively) were in the following way: I:6.8-3.6, II:18.7-8.2, III:2.7-1.5, IV-V:8.1-4.2, VI-VII:4.9-2.4, VIII:6.5-3.4 (values measured in millimeters). Conclusion It is essential to be conscious of the normal values of the neck lymph nodes in the normal pediatric population when dealing with.

            "text": "The imaging characteristics of lymphangiomas: Pictorial essay Harvey EL Teo KK Women's and Children's Hospital Background Lymphangiomas or cystic hygromas are congenital malformations of the lymphatic system. It is important to accurately diagnose these lesions to ensure appropriate management and therapy. Whilst these lesions are benign, they can be extensively infiltrative causing local symptoms requiring therapy. Occasionally, aggressive mixed lyphangiomatous and vascular tumours of the soft tissues may occur. Objective This pictorial essay will demonstrate the imaging characteristics of lymphangiomas in paediatric patients on ultrasound, CT and MRI. Familiarity with the imaging features will enable the radiologist to accurately assess, diagnose and stage these lesions. Results Lymphangiomas appear as transcompartmental multiloculated cystic lesions. The cystic areas are circumscribed and discrete. Marginal enhancement on cross-sectional imaging is usually present. Ultrasound is useful in the evaluation of small superficial lesions but is limited in determining the extent of spread in larger and deeper lesions. CT is useful in diagnosing and staging these lesions but results in exposure to ionizing radiation. The contrast resolution of CT is also inferior to MRI which is the modality of choice. The superior contrast resolution on MRI makes it the most sensitive modality for diagnosing and determining the extent of spread of these lesions. MRI can also diagnose mixed lesions by demonstrating flow signal changes and tubular, enhancing vascular channels within these lesions. Conclusion The ability of the different imaging modalities to appropriately diagnose and stage lymphangiomas in children is important and will be demonstrated in this pictorial essay. Background Congenital anomalies of the aortic arch and its branches are commonly encountered in radiological practice. A right-sided aortic arch (RAA) with an aberrant left subclavian artery (ALSA) is a rare anomaly that occurs in 0.05% of the population. Duplicated vertebral artery anomaly is very rare either depicted incidentally in autopsy series, or angiographic studies including noninvazive MR and CT angiographic studies which have been increasingly utilized in daily practice.",

Materials and methods The barium swallow of a 7-year-old boy revealed a posterior impression to esophagus on the lateral view suggesting vascular ring. MDCT angiography was performed subsequently to provide the definitive diagnosis by using a 16-slice MDCT scanner. 3D volume-rendered and maximum-intensity-projection images were obtained from the axial images. Results MDCT angiography identified RAA with ALSA arise from a diverticulum of Kommerell located posterior to the esophagus. No airway compression was identified. MDCT angiography also demonstrated that left vertebral artery (LVA) had 2 seperate origins, from left common carotid artery and ALSA respectively, called as \"duplicated vertabral artery\". Both vessels coursed straight up and united at C6 vertebral level to continue as the LVA and entered the foramen transversarium at the same level. The right vertebral artey was normal originating from the right subclavian artery. Conclusion During the long life span of the children, vascular anomalies may become important in the planning of interventional and surgical procedures. Knowing of the aortic arch and vertebral artery anomalies before the neurointerventional and neurosurgical procedures prevents complications. Radiologists should be familiar with various types of vascular anomalies since wider application of MDCT angiography, with excellent 3D images, increased the incidence of these anomalies in daily practice. Results Abnormal results of head ultrasound examination were found in 10,8% of newborn. The abnormalities were: asymetric lateral ventricle, asymptomatic cysts of the choroid plexus, increased CSF in the extraaxial spaces and intracranial haemorrhage grade I .Abnormal results of abdomen ultrasound examination were found in 20,2% of newborn. They were: hepatomegaly, hyperechoic renal papillae, renal abnormalities, situs inversus, dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces, hiperechogenic echoes in bladder. Four percent of newborn showed changes in both examinations.There were no characteristic abnormal-ities in the group with DM or in the group with GDM or in newborns with fetopathy.

Royal Childrens' Hospital, Melbourne, Australia Background Haemophilia is an X-linked disorder due to a deficiency of factor VIII or IX characterised by joint and muscle haemorrhages and prolonged, potentially fatal haemorrhage after trauma or surgery. However, bleeding does occur at other sites such as intramuscular haematomas and the \"closed-space\" bleeding phenomenon. Intracranial haemorrhage, a \"closed space\" event, is a severe but uncommon complication of haemophilia. Objective The aim is to review the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage in children with haemophilia attending a tertiary paediatric centre. Materials and methods A retrospective review of patients identified by records maintained by the Henry Ekert Haemophilia Treatment Centre between January 1991 and December 2005 was done. The disease severity, general radiological investigations and specifically initial neuro-imaging were analysed and the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage matched with disease severity. Results 102 patients were identified (82 haemophilia A; 20 haemophilia B). Of these, 18 (18%), 19 (19%) and 65 (63%) had mild, moderate and severe disease respectively. Sixty-three (61.8%) patients (aged 3 months to 18.5 years, mean 8.4 years) required imaging, of which 7 (11.1%) had CT; 7 (11.1%) had ultrasonography and 49 (77.8%) had plain radiography. All in the CT group had examination of the head-5 (71%) were under 5 years of age and 2 (29%) under 7 years of age. Four (57%) had normal scans and 3 (43%) had nontraumatic intracranial haemorrhage; two of whom were under one year and the other, aged six. Two of those who had intracranial haemorrhage had moderate disease and the other, severe. Conclusion Intracranial haemorrhage is an uncommon but significant complication of childhood haemophilia that can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Education of patients, carers and medical professionals should also include advice on symptoms that must alert to possible intracranial haemorrhage.",

Patients usually present with massive cervical lymphadenopathy but other nodal sites such as mediastinal or inguinal are also frequently involved. Objective To underline the importance of RDD in the differential diagnosis of the cervical lymphadenopathy in pediatric age group. Materials and methods 11 and 12 year-old two siblings with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies admitted to our radiology department for Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging for suspected lymphoma. Results In both patients, MR images demonstrated multiple massive lymphadenopathies in cervical regions mimicking lymphoma, one of the most common causes of malign lymphadenopathy in pediatric age group. No extranodal involvement was determined. In both cases, biopsies taken from cervical lymph nodes confirmed the diagnosis of RDD histopathologically. Conclusion Both of the cases showed that RDD must also be included in the list of differential diagnoses of diffuse and massive lymphadenopathy beside infectious/granulomatous conditions, lymphomatous and metastatic diseases.",

On further investigation all of these patients were revealed to have serious, aggressive pathology including malignancy. Materials and methods Cases include an arm lesion which had the appearances of a simple haematoma which was later revealed to be a PNET metastasis and an inguinal hernia which was later shown to be a large intra-abdominal kaposiform haemangionendothelioma with life threatening consumptive coagulopathy.

When intraabdominal pressure increases suddenly or splitting forces are applied to the abdominal wall, traumatic abdominal wall herniation takes place from anatomic weak areas. The diagnosis is often done by means of physical examination, which however can be difficult because of the abdominal wall tenderness, or by abdominal computed tomography (CT). Objective Our aim is to present a case of traumatic abdominal wall herniation and to discuss the relevant literature. Materials and methods A 21-months-old boy, who was overrun by a tractor, was admitted to our hospital. On admission, he had diffuse abdominal tenderness. He was conscious. Physical examination revealed a tender bulging mass and ecchymosis on the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. We examined the patient by chest x-ray, plain abdominal film and abdominopelvic CT exam which was performed by a 64-slice multidetector CT. Results His chest X-ray and abdominal plain film were normal. On the CT of the abdomen and pelvis, an abdominal wall herniation on the left upper quadrant was demonstrated and the small bowel loops were shown to be located subcutaneously in the anterior thoracic wall. The patient was operated and the defect was repaired. Conclusion Traumatic abdominal wall herniations are rare in pediatric population. In children with diffuse abdominal tenderness following a blunt abdominal trauma, the possibility of such a diagnosis should be remembered even if the chest x-rays or the abdominal plain films are normal. In such cases, CT can be considered as a useful diagnostic tool. Background Computerized tomography (CT) is used widely as first screening method for blunt abdominal trauma (BAT). The risk related to radiation is increased especially in children under that issue. The knowledge of usefulness of ultrasound (US) in management of patients with BAT will decrease unnecessary CT examination.

All children had an abdominal US as the primary screening method. Patients without solid-organ injury and with free intraperitoneal fluid at US examination were included. Intraperitoneal fluid was localized. US results were compared with findings of CT, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, laparotomy and clinical course. Results US examination revealed free fluid and/or solid-organ injury in 8 and only free intraperitoneal fluid in 14 patients. Two (14%) out of 14 patients had intrabdominal organ injury (one solid-organ injury, the other one intestinal injury required an operation). Among the 108 patients with negative finding at US, only one had solid-organ injury (false negative). Intraperitoneal fluid was located in pelvis in eight patients with two of them had pelvic wall injury. Fluid was involved the pelvis and abdomen in six patients: two had intrabdominal injury; one was surgical. All but one were followed up at emergency unit or hospitalized without need of any surgery and discharged. Conclusion US is an effective screening method in hemodynamically stable patients with BAT. Because the risk of serious intraabdominal injury is low in patients with only free fluid in pelvis detected by US, it seems sufficient to follow up clinically of these patients. The presence of free fluid beside pelvis in any location needs additional imaging methods.

The clinical findings were recorded and a CT venogram was obtained by using a 16-slice multidetector CT scanner after administration of contrast material via superficial veins of the dorsal feet. CT images were evaluated for soft tissue thickening, bone hypertrophy, and for the abnormalities of superficial and deep veins by using axial, MPR, MIP and volume-rendered images. Results Six patients were KTS type 1 and 2 patients were KTS type 2. In 6 patients blotchy stains were seen while the other 2 patients did not have stains. All patients had soft tissue thickening and three patients had hypertrophy of the affected limb. Venous abnormalities were present in all the patients.

S Deftereos, A Oikonomou, P Mintzopoulou, A Spanoudaki, E Vranou, P Prassopoulos University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Greece Background HD is a worldwide parasitic disease produced by the larval stage of Echinococcus, endemic in central and northern Europe, the Mediterranean, northern Asia, China, Japan, Turkey and parts of North America. Liver and lungs, in children, are the organs most frequently affected with typical and well known imaging findings. On the other hand, unusual anatomic locations, the related imaging findings and rare manifestations of HD are less frequently described. Objective To discuss the prevalence and imaging findings of unusual anatomic locations of HD in pediatric population. Materials and methods Radiological findings range from purely cystic to completely solid lesions that can be solitary or multiple. They can become quite large, especially the pulmonary lesions and in some atypical cases growth rate may overcome duplication annually. Calcification is rarely seen in pulmonary locations but is often in liver, spleen and kidney. Gallbladder, biliary, adrenal, peritoneal and brain locations are rare and may exhibit findings not similar to liver HD. Exophytic growth and transdiaphragmatic migration of liver HD is a rare manifestation. The diagnostic tool indicated depends on the organ involved and the evolution stage of the disease. US is the method of choice in purely cystic lesions, with floating membranes and daughter cysts. CT is preferred for chest diagnosis and is best for demonstrating calcifications and complications. MR imaging is especially helpful in detecting HCs of the central nervous system. Conclusion Familiarity with unusual locations of HD and atypical radiological manifestations enables usage of best diagnostic tools and accurate diagnosis of the disease. Background The major morbidity and cause of death during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are related to neurological complications. Early diagnosis is important to guide further treatment. However, diagnostic methods available during ECMO are limited, especially in older children. MRI is a sensitive and reliable method for assessment of brain parenchymal changes. We have previously reported an animal experiment with MRI during ECMO. However, the use of MRI in patients during ECMO has to our knowledge never been reported. Objective We report the first successful MRI examination of a patient during ECMO treatment. Materials and methods An eight-year-old boy with proven haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was admitted to the paediatric intensive care with sepsis and ARDS after operation of an intussusception and bowel necrosis. Progressive cardiopulmonary insufficiency necessi-tated ECMO-treatment. During the treatment seizures and intermittent hypertension with dilated pupils were noted. Cranial CT showed bilateral hypodense regions in the basal ganglia and thalami but could not differentiate toxic oedema from infarction/necrosis. Therefore the patient was prepared for MRI using non-wired cannulas, 2 m extra tubing and a mobile ECMO-system that we had previously tested for MRI. The brain was examined with conventional imaging including diffusion weighted imaging and proton spectroscopy. Results High quality images of the brain were obtained without disturbing the function of the ECMO system. Spectroscopy was successfully conducted with clear visualization of pathological metabolites. As expected MRI provided critical information for the lesions characterization and extension. Widespread infarction/necrosis with hemorrhagic components were diagnosed in the basal ganglia, thalami, brainstem and corticospinal tracts. Conclusion MRI can safely be performed and provide important information in patients with neurological complications during ECMO treatment.",

Department of Radiology, Medical School, Erciyes University 2. Department of Plastic Surgery, Medical School, Erciyes University Abstract Infiltrating lipomas are seen more frequently after 30-40 years of age. They are uncommon in children. Only few pediatric cases have been described in the literature. Infiltrating lipomas have congenital and acquired forms. The congenital form is typically seen before 2 years of age. In this paper we describe three pediatric congenital infiltrating lipomas with localization of face, trunk and foot. Report We report a 6 month-old girl with a soft mobile mass on her cheek causing facial asymmetry and ptotic lip, a 1 year old boy with a soft mass on his left foot which had been growing since his birth and a 1 year old boy with a soft mass on his left paravertebral space. The masses were mobile and ill-defined. For each cases MRI were carried out. MRI showed that the lesions had lipom-like signal intensity and were infiltrating the adjacent structures. Surgical decompression were performed. Histopathologic examinations revealed mature adipose tissue without any nuclear atypia. On the routine controls the rest of lipomas were observed without any change in size. Discussion MRI is the best imaging technique to diagnose soft tissue tumors. We can easily observe the homogenous fatty tissue invading the adjacent structures as a common feature of the infiltrating lipomas in our cases. But only clinical examination or MRI can not be reliably to differentiate lipoma, liposarcoma and lipoblastoma. To diagnose the lipoma histolopathological examination is usually required.",

Results Mean examination time was 3 min and 40 s for full body, full spine and lower limb, and 2 min and 30 s for the other investigated areas. Comparison with available literature showed that EOS provides better workflow than CR and equivalent or better than DR. Time gain is particularly high for long length examinations since the image is acquired in one single scan. Conclusion Ultra Low Dose Radiology improved the workflow in a paediatric radiology department. Spine and lower limb examinations could be performed in less than 4 minutes.",

Conclusion Familiarity with the risk factors and presentation of osteopenia of prematurity is essential for those radiologists who report neonatal radiographs. This exhibit gives a rapid overview, arming the paediatric radiologist with the key information to make their assessment. Background CRMO is a rare inflammatory bone disease of unknown aetiology occurring mainly in children and adolescents. It may be difficult to distinguish CRMO from other bone diseases such as bacterial osteomyelitis or primary bone tumours. Diagnosis of CRMO is often delayed. Objective To review typical and atypical imaging patterns in order to prevent misdiagnosis and therefore, to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures or prolonged antibiotic therapy. Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed clinical and imaging (X rays, CT, scintigraphy and MRI) findings of 21 children with CRMO. Diagnosis was based on the following criteria: (1) age under 18 years, (2) two different sites (at least) of bone involvement or one site associated to a fluctuating course with at least 2 recurrent episodes of pain and (3) surgical biopsy to exclude infectious and tumoral processes. Results The sex ratio was 2/1 (14 girls and 7 boys) and the age range 3-18 years. The disease was multifocal in 17 patients. Appendicular skeleton was involved in 19 patients: tibia, femur, humerus and radius were primarily affected, mainly at the metaphyseal sites. Involvement of epiphysis or diaphysis was rare. Axial skeleton, mostly clavicle and spine, was involved in 8 patients. Radiographs and CT demonstrated the typical pattern of combined osteolysis and osteosclerosis in half of the study group. In the other half, osteosclerosis only or osteolysis was present. Hyperostosis was a common finding. MRI showed in all patients bone marrow oedema and adjacent soft tissue edema was frequent. No abcess formation was seen. Whole-body-MRI (STIR sequences) was always more contributive than scintigraphy to detect metaphyseal abnormalities. Conclusion Imaging patterns in CRMO are quite characteristic. However, atypical features deserve attention and whole-body-MRI seems very pertinent to detect silent lesions.",

Bone radiographs, CT scans of the involved bone and in 4 cases MRI too, were performed. All had chest CT and bone biopsy. The scans were repeated at intervals of six/ eight months. Results There were 5 boys and 2 girls (mean age: 8 years; range 3-14). Radiographs and CT bone scans revealed bony destruction or lytic lesions localized: in first metatarsal (1), in pelvis (2), in spine (1 cervical and 1 lumbar vertebra), in sternum (1) and femore (1). Four patients had association of bony lesion with extended asymptomatic pulmonary involvement: chest CT scans showed nodular lesions and thin-walled cysts, but the nodular lesions disappeared or were transformed into cystic lesions in the later scans. Most of the final scans revealed thin-walled cysts and emphysematous lesions. Histological examination of the bone biopsy showed features of eosinophilic granuloma with aggregates of Langerhans histiocytes. Conclusion EG is a rare intrinsically benign disease producing a destructive tumor with a variable clinical presentation and an often unpredictable clinical course .

Bitemporal arachnoid cysts and macrocephaly are the most common features of infants and children with GA-1. Objective To review the imaging features of GA-1 in a group of seven child patients. Materials and methods Clinical history and findings and brain MRI, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusionweighted imaging (DWI) results in 7 patients were reviewed. Results The most common clinical presentation was encephalitis-like episode. Age at the time of the diagnosis ranged between 6 and 24 months. Male to female ratio was 2/5. In all the patients macrocephaly, brain atrophy or hypoplasia, white matter changes, open opercula (usually very widely open), and wide cerebrospinal fluid spaces anterior to the temporal lobes were present. Basal ganglia lesions, presenting as volume loss and high T2 signal intensity in the lentiform nucleus bilaterally, were found in 100%. In one of the patients bilateral subdural hemorrhages were demonstrated. The MRS showed decreased N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratio and increase in choline (Cho)/Cr ratio. In addition, there was prominent lactate (lac) peak at 1.33 ppm. In DWI, we observed widespread restricted diffusion in the white matter and increased diffusion in bilateral putamen. Conclusion The finding of very widely open opercula suggests GA-1, and if combined with basal ganglia lesions is almost pathognomonic, especially in a child with macrocephaly. While conventional MR imaging plays an important role in determination of morphologic changes, functional information in areas of the brain involved can be provided by proton MRS and DWI.",

Materials and methods Among 429 patients with solid tumors during the period of 10 years, 4 eventually developed brain metastases. Patients with lesions secondary to direct extension from the skull or dura were excluded. MR characteristics studied of the brain metastasis included location, signal intensity, enhancement pattern, the presence of intratumoral haemorrhage, as well as the presence of secondary hydrocephalus or leptomeningeal spread. Results Of the 429 children with solid malignant tumors included in this study, 4 (0,9%) developed solitary brain metastasis. The solid primary tumours were nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, Wilm's tumour, Osteosarcoma und Hepatoblastoma. The mean time from initial diagnosis to the detection of brain metastases was 8, 5 months. All patients but one-nonsmall cell lung carcinoma-had known lung metastases. Brain metastases in children can have different sizes (mean size: 14 mm) and show perifocal oedema when associated with bleeding. All tumours were subcortical/cortical based and isointense with grey matter on unenhanced T1-weighted images and in two cases mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Two patients showed restriction on diffusion-weighted images (DWI). Three out of 4 patients showed enhancement; two nodular-and one ringenhancement. In the patient with osteosarcoma the metastasis was calcified. Conclusion Solitary brain metastasis was the rule with variable MRcharacteristics. Although brain metastases are rare in children, they have grave prognosis. But CNS metastasis is not in itself a terminal event; metastasis in patients with Wilm's tumor might behave differently. We suggest MR routine imaging studies as part of metastases screening and by the time of tumor recurrence, especially in patients with solid tumors and recurrent or prior lung metastasis, even if the child shows no neurological changes. Background Foci of altered signal intensity (FASI) are the most common CNS involvement in neurofibromatosis von Recklinghausen type1. Progression of FASI during childhood, followed by their regression after puberty had been described previously. Objective The aim was to follow progression/ regression of FASI in NF1 in different age groups and different brain structures. Materials and methods Authors retrospectively evaluated development of FASI on the brain MRI in 200 NF1 patients. Groups of patients were defined according to patients age in time of examination. Groups of patients were imaged during childhood (below 10 years), between childhood and puberty, during puberty (10-14 years), between puberty and juvenile age and after puberty (more than 14 years). Results FASI involved 165/200 (82.5%) NF1 patients, 126 of them were followed up. Progression/regression ratio of FASI was 79/100 during childhood, 23/46 between childhood and puberty, 32/27 during puberty, 11/56 between puberty and juvenile age and 12/46 during juvenile age. Conclusion Regression of FASI prevails from the first examination during childhood till puberty and it is even accentuated after puberty. Progression of FASI was seen only during puberty.",

Retrospective chart review was performed to examine the extent of cutaneous involvement. Multiplicity was defined as presence of 3 or more cutaneous naevi in physical examination. CNS involvement was defined as abnormal T1 hyperintensities and/or leptomeningeal enhancement in MRI brain or spinal cord using a 1.5 Tesla magnet. Other associated findings were documented. Results A total of 25 complete MRI studies of neuraxis were available for review in the imaging database. There were 16 males and 9 females, age ranged from 5 days to 13 years old (median= 9 months old). Twelve of the 25 patients had CNS involvement, among those 9 had multiple naevi. For those with only 1 or 2 pigmented naevi, only 3 out of 13 had CNS involvement. Three patients had T1 hyperintense lesions in the brain, 4 patients had leptomeningeal enhancement in spinal cord, 3 had leptomeningeal enhancement in brain and spinal cord. Two other patients had both T1 hyperintense lesions in the brain and leptomeningeal enhancement in the spinal cord. Chi square test showed a highly significant association between multiplicity of skin lesions and CNS involvement (6.74, p value of 0.009 with 99% C.I.). Conclusion MR imaging is an essential part of the evaluation for patients with giant/multiple congenital melanocytic naevi. Limited set of patients with multiple skin lesions appear to have a 3-fold increase in risk for neurocutaneous melanosis. This further supports and estimated the relative risk of CNS involvement. Background Prader Willi (PWS) is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by hyperphagia, obesity, small stature and learning difficulties. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinicalneuroradiological entity, potentially reversible and usually presenting with acute or subacute headache, altered mental status, vomiting, seizures, and occipital lobe related symptoms. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) shows: cortical and subcortical white matter edema of the parieto-occipital lobes, and other cerebral structures, such as the basal ganglia, frontal lobes, cerebellum, and brainstem. Acquired tonsil herniation, so-called \"acquired Chiari I\", may occur secondary to CSF hypotension, raised intracranial pressure (IP) or venous hypertension (VH). Case report A 7 year-old-boy, with a history of PWS, hyperthophicdilatative cardiomyopathy, arterious hypertension and renal cystic dysplasia, presented with asthenia, headache and extreme blood hypertension (BH). On admission, a brain CT showed small ventricles, multiple and symmetric hypodense cortical and subcortical areas, involving both of the cerebral hemispheres. The MR showed multiple areas of T2 hyperintesity and corresponding T1 hypointensity, prevailingly subcortical but also involving the cortex. The MRA and MRV were normal. DWI showed vasogenic, rather than cytoxic edema. The cerebellum was less affected but, likely due to raised IP, downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum was evident. The child underwent a suboccipital decompression. The follow up MRI showed complete resolution imaging abnormalities. Clinical and imaging manifestations reversibility confirmed the diagnosis of PRES secondary to acute high blood pressure. Discussion and conclusion To our knowledge, we first describe a case of PRES in PWS with associated cerebellar tonsil herniation requiring urgent decompression. In absence of a previously diagnosed Chiari malformation, we can suppose that brain edema, observed during acute BH, resulted in ICH and tonsil herniation. Pathophysiology of PRES, particularly in the presented case, is debated.",

Thanks to the plasticity of the brain rehabilitation may cause reorganization of the cerebral cortex thus enabling clinical improvement. Objective To present the results of 1HMRS in children with cerebral palsy as a basis for evaluation of brain reorganization after one year of rehabilitation. Materials and methods Material consists of 56 children (34 m, 22f), aged 2,2-15,7 years, divided into 5 subgroups: (1) right-(n= 11) and (2) left (n = 7) hemiplegia, (3) diplegia (n = 19), (4) quadriplegia (n=14), (5) other/unclasified (n=5). Control group consists of 61 children (33 m, 28 f), aged 1,5-18,2 years. So far six children have been examined after 1 year of rehabilitiation. Nacetyloaspartate, choline and myoinositol ratios to creatine were obtained symmetrically in the cortex of frontal lobe, frontal operculum, temporo-occipital junction and in the basal ganglia. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney, t-Student and Wilcoxon tests (p<0.05). Results Comparison of the ratios was performed in the analyzed group between the right and left hemisphere. This group was also compared to the control group. The most statistically significant differences were found in: 1) the NAA/Cr ratios, 2) the clinical group 4, 3) the basal ganglia. In the follow-up examinations no increase in NAA/Cr ratio has been found so far. Conclusion Statistically significant differences between analyzed and control group were the most pronounced in clinical subgroup 4. This may reflect the most severe brain injury in this group in our material. Paradoxically these differences were found mostly in the basal ganglia and not as expected in the cerebral cortex. Obtained initial results do not indicate the expected spectroscopic improvement in the rehabilitated patients and require further analysis in bigger material.",

We aimed to document the radiologic abnormalities seen in the central nervous system (CNS) after treatment of childhood leukemia with MR imaging using standart and diffusion MR protocols. We aimed to show the advantage of diffusion MR to cranial MR. Materials and methods MR images of 29 patients with ALL were examined. Images were aquired by a 1.5 T MR by using T1-weighted, T2-weighted spin echo, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences and diffusion MRI . All of the patients were treated according to TRALL protocol. Seven ( 24%) of them were in high, 19 (65%) of them were in medium, 15 (51%) of them were low risk group. None of them have any acute neurological disorder. Results Twenty seven patient had no abnormality on cranial and diffusion MR. Two patients had abnormal findings. One of them had milimetric hemorrhagic brain lesion on cranial and diffusion MR. Another patient had chronic brain lesion due to previous meningitis on two different technique. Conclusion The CNS abnormalities that occur after the treatment of leukemia are related to the leukemia itself, to the treatment method, and to the duration of survival. Because many neurologic complications of leukemia are treatable, early diagnosis is essential. There was no positive impact of diffusion MR technique on cured ALL patients who did not have any acute neurological symptoms.

Diagnosis relies heavily on imaging as presentation can be insidious with headache being the only feature with cranial neuropathies or long tract signs only developing later. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent disability Objective To review the clinical and imaging features of central skull base osteomyelitis with an emphasis on MR imaging. Materials and methods We reviewed the clinical presentation, complications, CT and MR imaging in four patients with central skull base osteomyelitis. No patient had predisposing otitis media of the temporal bone. Results Clinical presentations were varied. Complications included lateral medullary syndrome, cavernous sinus thrombosis, epidural abscesses and cranial neuropathies. CT features showed no changes or very mild bone lucency with paranasal sinus opacification. The most consistent MR imaging findings were clival and petrous apex bone marrow T1 hypointensity which showed improvement following antibiotic treatment. Post gadolinium T1 fat saturation imaging was also useful to demonstrate dural enhancement and the extent of any associated soft tissue phlegmon. Conclusion Although a rare condition , knowledge of the imaging features of skull base osteomyelitis is vital in order to facilitate early diagnosis. Early intervention with appropriate treatment may then prevent or limit further complications such as intracranial extension, empyema, or death. Background Sj\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a neurocutaneous syndrome caused by a genetic deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) enzyme in lipid metabolism, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. It is characterized by congenital ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. Accumulation of long-chain fatty alcohol which is detectable by chemical-shift analysis is thought to be responsible for the cutaneous and neurologic symptoms of SLS. Objective Our purpose was to characterize the cerebral involvement in SLS and to demonstrate its Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) and MR Spectroscopy findings. Materials and methods A 7-year and a 2-year old male, both with ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spastic diplegia, were assessed with MRI and MR Spectroscopy. Also various biochemical tests were used to identify any enzymatic deficiency. Results MRI showed periventricular lesions, low intensity on T1weighted images and high intensity on T2-weighted images at trigones of the lateral ventricles in both patients. In the first patient white matter of the frontal lobes were also involved according to late stage of the disease. 1H-MRS of these lesions in both patients revealed high lipid and low N-acetyl aspartate peaks. Fatty alcohol oxidoreductase (FAO) deficiency that is specific for Sj\u00f6gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) has been verified biochemically. Conclusion SLS is a rare lipid metabolism disorder and should be kept in mind for the differential diagnosis of the cases with demyelination in the periventricular white matter and lipid peaks in 1H-MRS.

Inadequate or non-existent communication between the cyst and the neighboring CSF spaces seems to be responsible for mass effect and progressive symptoms. Therefore, demonstration of communication between AC and the adjacent CSF space is often required if surgical therapy is contemplated. Objective To evaluate the role of phase-contrast cine MR imaging (PC-MRI) in detecting possible communications between intraventricular ACs (IV-ACs) and CSF spaces based on comparison with MR cisternography (MRC) in pediatric cases. Materials and methods The study group was consisted of 11 pediatric patients with IV-AC (age range, 6 months-10 years; mean age, 6 years) underwent PC-MRI followed by MRC after intratechal injection of 0.5 ml gadopentetate dimeglumine. The results were statistically analyzed by using the McNemar test. Results According to the MRC results, of 11 IV-ACs 6 were noncommunicating and 5 communicating. PC-MRI results were compatible with MRC findings in 8 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of PC-MRI imaging in demonstrating the communication between the IV-ACs and the CSF were 100% and 50%, respectively (PPV: 63%, NPV: 100%). Conclusion Our results show that PC-MRI is a reliable method for identifying of non-communicating IV-ACs. However, any positive result for communication between an IV-AC and neighboring CSF spaces on PC-MRI should be encountered with suspicion. Background SBS frequently leads to death or severe morbidity. Inflicted circumstances are unknown at the time of the diagnosis.

Thereby, the diagnosis of age-different hematomas should take into account two different locations. Conclusion Two sites at least of subdural hematoma are almost constant in SBS. The analysis of the vertex is one clue. Background Hemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis (HLS), also called hemophagocytic syndrome, is a rare multisystem immune disorder characterized with aggressive proliferation of activated macrophages and histiocytes. Secondary HLS is much more common than the primary disease. Almost all patients die following occurrence of multiple relapses or central nervous system disease progression. Objective To evaluate cranial imaging features of HLS and define the frequency and severity of the lesions. Materials and methods The clinical and radiologic data of 9 infants diagnosed as primary HLS in Erciyes University, Gevher Nesibe Hospital between May 2005 and January 2009 have been retrospectively analyzed. All patients had cranial CT and/or contrast-enhanced MR imaging. The images were interpreted by two pediatric radiologists independently. Results All patients (5 girls, 4 boys) presented with convulsion except 2 patients who had hemiparesis and tremor of the upper extremity. The prognosis was poor that 8 of the 9 patients died during follow-up. One patient, who was alive, was recently diagnosed and under therapy. The imaging findings were normal in 5 patients. The most common finding was T2-prolongation of cerebral white matter that was seen 4 patients. Cerebellar white matter was also involved in 3 patients. There were lesions in brain stem in 2 patients. There were corticospinal tract involvement in 1 patient and laminar necrosis in 1 patient. There were multiple nodular lesions in the cerebrum and cerebellum with ring enhancement in 1 patient and without ring enhancement in the other. Diagnostic value of CT was significantly lower than MR imaging. Conclusion Primary HLS may have characteristic cranial MRI features. Radiologists should be aware of the characteristic MRI findings which can be used as a supplementary diagnostic modality to clinical and laboratory findings of HLS. Results The mean age of the study group was 5.7 years (range, 1-15 years) including 19 boys and 13 girls. Ten patients had history of upper airway infection and 6 had history of gastroenteritis prior to the onset of the disease. The mean duration of the symptoms was 5.5 days (range, 2-22 days) and the mean recovery time was 7.5 days (range, 3-21 days). Twenty patients had electromyogram and 18 of them revealed findings consistent with GBS. Twenty-nine patients had albumino-cytologic dissociation. Thirty patients were treated with IVIG, and 2 with plasmapheresis. All but 2 patients had thickening and contrast enhancement of nerve roots and cauda equina on spinal MRI. The enhancement was mild in 13 patients, moderate in 12 patients, and severe in 5 patients. Seventeen patients had cranial MRI in addition to spinal MRI and they did not reveal any abnormality although 2 of them had unilateral 6th cranial nerve paralysis. Conclusion Contrast-enhanced spinal MRI is a reliable imaging for the diagnosis of GBS that it was positive in 30 of 32 of our patients. Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the characteristic MRI findings which can be used as a supplementary diagnostic modality to clinical and laboratory findings of GBS.",

Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, Erciyes University 2. Department of Pediatric Hematology, School of Medicine, Erciyes University Background Vitamin K deficiency, causing bleeding in infant period of life, known as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN) is divided into three categories: early, classic and late HDN. Early HDN occurs within 24 h, classic HDN occurs on days one to seven; common bleeding sites are gastrointestinal, cutaneous. Late HDN occurs from week 2 to 12; and may be associated with serious and life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage that can be detected with cranial imaging. Objective We discuss the cranial imaging features of late HDN and draw attention to the importance of prophylaxis, early diagnosis and adequate treatment of late-type HDN, and we review the relevant literature. Materials and methods Data of 16 infants treated with late-type HDN in Erciyes University, Gevher Nesibe Hospital between June 2006 and December 2008 have been retrospectively analyzed. The images were interpreted by two radiologists independently and the radiological findings were correlated with neurological findings. Results The patients's (10 boys and 6 girls) ages varied from 31 days to 10 months (median 3 months). Twelve infants presented with irritability and convulsions, whereas 4 were admitted with complaints of bleeding from previous injections. Ten infants revealed neurological abnormalities including hypertonicity, hyperreflexia, and respiratory disorder. All patients were examined with cranial CT and 4 patients had cranial MRI in the late phase. Twelve of the 16 patients who presented with neurological abnormalities had intracranial hemorrhage and unilateral cerebral edema. The hemorrhages were subpial and subdural in 12, intracerebral in 5, intraventricular in 2 patients. There were subfalcine herniation in 5 patients with hemorrhage and 1 obstructive hydrocephaly secondary to intrecerebral hematoma. Conclusion Clinicians and radiologists have a crucial role in the early diagnosis and adequate treatment of late-type HDN. The awareness of these radiological findings of late HDN will contribute to early diagnosis.",

Abdulhakim Coskun, Ali Yikilmaz, Selim Doganay, Ertugrul Mavili, Ibrahim Sacit Tuna, Halil Donmez School of Medicine, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey Background Headache is a common clinical problem during childhood. The role of neuroimaging is controversial. Objective To describe the cranial neuroimaging features in children with primary recurrent headache and evaluate its necessity. Materials and methods Thirty children (19 girls, 11 boys; age range, 6-15 years) with primary recurrent headache were prospectively evaluated with cranial CT (15 patients) or MRI (15 patients). Patients with pathologic neurological symptoms and signs were excluded from the study. Images were evaluated by two radiologists independently with respect to the brain parenchyma. Extracranial structures and sinuses were not evaluated. Results Twenty-four patients showed normal imaging findings. There was ventricular dilatation in 3 patients and mild cerebellar atrophy in 1 patient. There was a unilateral arachnoid cyst with a diameter of 4 cm in the left temporal fossa in 1 patient. In one patient, there was multiple, bilateral T2-hyperintense foci in cerebral white matter consistent with non specific white matter disease. In this patient, further clinical evaluation was suggested and imaging findings contributed to the patient management. Conclusion The vast majority of the cases had no abnormal neuroimaging findings that changed the patient management. Hence, children who present with primary headache without neurological symptoms and signs should not be warranted routinely in the evaluation of childhood headache. Background Polymicrogyria is a malformation of cortical development with abnormal neuronal organisation. It results in multiple small gyri with an irregular grey-white matter junction. Many causes for polymicrogyria are recognised, including congenital infections and genetic syndromes. Objective We present the novel, characteristic MRI phenotype in three patients from two separate families. All patients have severe, generalised bilateral polymicrogyria. The corpus callosum is either absent or hypoplastic. The brainstem has a characteristic pontomedullary junction with a widened upper medulla. The tectum is prominent. The MRI findings are described and illustrated. Conclusion The clinical and MRI phenotype suggests that this is a novel, new genetic syndrome with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Known mutations for polymicrogyria were excluded and therefore it is concluded that this is a recessive mutation in a novel gene. Background and objective The origin of the association of the agenesis of the corpus callosum with interhemispheric cyst (ACC with IHC) is controversial and several systems have been proposed to classify this entity. We aimed to present five patients of ACC with IHC, and discuss different aspects from currently established classification system.",

Objective SWI was evaluated for the diagnostic potential in vascular malformations and in characterizing of cerebral tumors. Materials and methods We studied children with vasular malformations and different cerebral lesions on 1.5T MR units using standard head coils. A high-resolution 3D highly T2*-weighted gradient echo sequence with first-order flow compensation and radiofrequency spoiling was created for SWI. Magnitude and phase images were reconstructed. Results Using high-resolution SWI highly detailed information about the veins was obtained in all patients with vascular malformations. Differentiation of calcified lesions or hemorrhages was possible by using phase images. Conclusion In children high-resolution SWI may be of special importance in the early detection and assessment of vascular malformations and in the differential diagnosis of different tumor entities.

Imaging was performed on a 3.0 T MR unit (MR-Tim Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12 channel head coil. For DTI a TRSE-EPI-DTI-sequence was used (70 directions, 55 slices, b-values 0-700 s/mm\u00b2, TR 6,400 ms, TE 80 ms, FoV 240 mm, 2.5 mm voxel isotrop, 08:27 min). The Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) and fractional anistropy (FA) were evaluated. For group analysis 27 regions of interest in each hemisphere were analysed in each patient.

Mental retardation, seizures and motor mental disease are the most presenting clinical features. Objective To evaluate the correlation between clinical presentation and the extent of cortical involvement in patients with polymicrogyria. Materials and methods The MR findings of 26 patients were evaluated for the location and distribution of polymicrogyria. Presence of asphyxia at birth and serological tests for TORCH infections, the presence and type (spastic, flaccid) of motor deficits, mental development, microcephaly, and epilepsy were noted. Results 19 patients had bilateral whereas 7 had unilateral involvement. Patients with unilateral polymicrogyria presented later with milder symptoms. The most encountered symptom in patients with bilateral involvement was MMR (89%) and speech problems (84%). The clinical presentations of patients with asphyxia and positive serological tests for CMV were worse. All patients with positive serological tests for CMV had bilateral involvement. Perisylvian region was affected in 5 (71%) patients with unilateral involvement. The most encountered presenting symptom in these patients was epilepsy. Cerebral palsy was seen in three (43%) of the patients and all of them had left hemiparesis. Microcephaly, MMR and speech delay was detected in one (14%) of the patients. Conclusion Late presenting epilepsy may be a predictor of a unilateral polymicrogyria and is associated with relatively good prognosis.

The holoprosencephalies are a group of disorders that are characterized by a failure of differantiation and cleavage of prosencephalon, and divided into three categories: alobar, semilobar and lobar. Alobar holoprosencephaly is the most severe form. Objective Altough alobar holoprosencephaly is the most common form of holoprosencephaly diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound, affected patients are rarely imaged by CT or MR postnatally. Th\u0131s rarity probably stems from the fact that most affected infants are stillborn or have a very short lifespan . In this poster we report cranial BT images of an eight months aged baby who had typical findings of alobar holoprosencphaly. Materials and methods An eigth moths aged female baby with severe facial abnormalities (hypotelorizm, median lip and palate cleft, single nostril) and hypotonia admitted to our hosp\u0131tal because of epilepsy. After clinical examination a nonenhaced CT of the brain was performed. Results On the nonenhaced CT of the bran we observed a large thin layer of cortex around a large monoventricle with large dorsal cyst. No interhemispheric fissure, falx cerebri, third ventricle or corpus callosum could be identified. The thalami and basal ganglia were reduced in volume, fused and anteriorly placed. Conclusion Alobar holoprosencephaly is the most severe form, imaging studies are severely abnormal, as well. In affected patients, ventral medial portions of the brain never form. As a result the hypotalami and basal ganglia are fused and reduced in volume and the third ventricle is absent. Patient with alobar holoprosencephaly usually have severe midline facial deformities and hypotelorism, resulting from absence or hypoplasia of the premaxillary segment of the face .

No associated calcifications, maxillary osseous changes, or lymphadenopathy were present. Histological analysis of the resected intraoral mass demonstrated benign adipose tissue with superimposed fat necrosis. Conclusion The differential diagnosis for soft tissue masses within the pediatric oral cavity is rather extensive and includes granular cell tumors including congenital epulitides, rhabdomyomas, salivary gland tumors, venolymphatic malformations, ectopic thyroid tissue, traumatic granulomas, and fat-containing masses. Pediatric fat-containing intraoral masses would include dermoid cysts, tumors of adipose origin, or surgically placed fat for the correction of various oral cavity defects. In addition, though a relatively rare entity with less than forty case reports in the literature in the presence of antecedent trauma and fat-containing mass identified on imaging traumatically herniated buccal fat pad into the oral cavity should be considered.",

            "text": "Background The utility of proton-MR spectroscopy (MRS) of the pediatric brain is well established for a variety of conditions (i.e. Canavan's, hyperglycinemia, leukodystrophy). However, there is little data on the overall utility of pediatric brain MRS in the setting of normal conventional MRI imaging. Objective Better defining clinical and imaging scenarios in which MRS will likely be diagnostic or supportive in diagnosis/therapy may help utilize this resource more effectively. We hypothesize that the diagnostic yield of MRS is lower in patients with otherwise normal conventional MRI (cMRI)findings, than in those with additional abnormalities on cMRI sequences. Materials and methods Retrospective analysis was performed of MRS studies completed October 1, 2007-September 30, 2008. The imaging results were documented separately for cMRI and MRS into 3 categories: \"normal\", \"abnormal without contribution to diagnosis\", and \"abnormal with contribution to diagnosis\". The coincidence of diagnostic outcomes between conventional MR and MRS was determined. Pictorial essay of typical cMRI/MRS findings is also presented. Results The total number of MRS studies performed over the 12 month period was 153. Overall, 50 MRI studies had a normal MRS in conjunction with a normal cMRI. In 41 studies, there was a normal MRS in conjunction with an abnormal cMRI. In 62 patients, both MRS and cMRI were abnormal; of these studies, MRS significantly contributed to making the diagnosis in 44 patients and was non-contributory in 18 cases. No studies were found in which the MRS was abnormal in conjunction with a normal cMRI. Conclusion Our data demonstrates that MR spectroscopy is normal in the presence of a normal conventional MRI. Also, MRS was significantly contributing to the diagnosis in 33% (44/154) of patients. Imaging resources may be more economically utilized if MR spectroscopy is directed to patients with abnormal cMRI or high clinical suspicion for a leukodystrophy. Background Retroperitoneal liposarcoma in children is very rare. About less than 10 cases were reported previously.

Delayed scan depicted more internal homogenous enhancement without fatty component. Differential diagnosis included Rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma and liposarcoma. Bone scan and bone marrow showed no metastasis and normal blood cells respectively. Surgical en bloc excision discovered a hard yellowish tumor without invasion to adjacent organs and pathology revealed myxoid and round cell liposarcoma. Right pyeloplasty was also done. Conclusion Although liposarcoma is very rare in children, it should be included in the differential diagnosis; solid pattern in CT is one of the three presentations; association with ureteropelvic junction stricture has not been reported before, it may be a new disease entity or coincidence. Radical excision of tumor usually comes up with complete cure but recurrence may occur. Results CT revealed plaque-like thickening in the parietal peritoneum along the undersurface of the right hemidiaphragm, broad based solid masses located on the visseral surface of the left lobe of liver and the location of spleen ; noduler lesions located in the mesentery of the small bowel; tumor invasion of the falciform ligament and gallbladder bed and massive ascites. Conclusion The CT apperarance of neoplastic involvement of the peritoneum has been described as plaque-like thickening or nodular solid implants in the parietal peritoneum, generally that lining the diaphragm and/or visseral peritoneum, usually in the perihepatic space. The lesions that are detected in pelvis especially in Douglas are named as drop metastasis. The diffuse infiltration of the greater omentum reveals the characteristic omental cake appearence. Ascites often accompanies. Our case had both the plaque-like peritoneal thickening and the noduler mass lesions together with massive ascites. Peritoneal metastasis in Wilm's tumor are generally encountered after surgery as in our case. Before deciding for a treatment it is very important to show local or distant involvement in Wilm's tumor and CT is the single preferred examination.",

Approximately 15% to 20% of childhood leukemias are of the AML type, with an incidence of 5 to 7 cases per million people per year in the United States. Despite advances, AML accounts for 30% of the deaths secondary to leukemia in children.The term AML refers to a varied group of malignancies arising in the marrow. The etiology and pathogenesis of the disease is complex, involving different genetic mutations resulting in proliferation and increase in the survival of myeloid cells. Other important factors are the exposure to environmental factors (e.g. chemotherapy, ionizing radiation etc) and having certain inherited and acquired conditions (e.g. Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia etc). Treatment of AML can result in significant morbidity. Objective The purpose of this presentation is to illustrate the imaging findings in AML at presentation as well as to demonstrate the various complications of treatment. Materials and methods After obtaining institutional ethics board approval, a database of AML patients was accessed and pertinent imaging studies assessed. Results In the last 9 years (January 2000-December 2008), 90 new cases of AML had been diagnosed at our institution. Using various modalities (radiographs, ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging), we have observed abnormalities at presentation including parenchymal lung disease, infiltration of solid viscera, osteomyelitis, soft tissue infections and bone marrow abnormalities. During treatment we had seen multiples complication including fungal infections of different organs, neutropenic enterocolitis, typhlitis, abscesses, deep venous thrombosis and hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Conclusion There is a wide spectrum of imaging findings seen in seen in pediatric patients with AML. Some are seen at presentation and others are the sequelae of intense treatment. Familiarity with the appearances will aid the pediatric radiologist in the imaging of patients with AML.",

An increased incidence of FNH has been described in oncology patients after completion of tumor therapy. Its development may be related to the vascular damage induced by such therapy. Objective We present MRI findings of a child who developed FNH after receiving chemotherapy for primary disease of neuroblastoma. Materials and methods A boy with right surrenal mass had been diagnosed with neuroblastoma at 2 years of age. He had been underwent surgery and received antineoplastic therapy. He was in remission for 8 years. When the patient was 10 years of age, thorax CT for the evaluation of fever and productive cough revealed solid masses in the upper part of the liver. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate the liver lesions and to rule out metastasis. Results The lesions were isointense to slightly hyperintense on T2weighted images, isointense to slightly hypointense to liver on T1weighted images. A small central scar of the largest diameter lesion was hyperintense on T2-weighted images. After contrast administration, the lesions highly enhanced homogenously during the arterial phase and became isointense during the portal venous phase. The central scar of the largest lesion demonstrated delayed enhancement. Malignant lesions, in contrast, are almost always hyperintense on T2-weighted images, typically hypointense on unenhanced T1-weighted images and delayed images and hyperintense during the arterial phase and have a variable appearance during the portal venous phase. FNH of the liver was diagnosed because of the typical appearance of the lesions on MRI. Conclusion FNH should be considered in a patient with a history of malignancy treated with chemotherapy who develops hepatic masses. Recognition of the characteristic imaging appearance will aid in the correct diagnosis and might obviate the need for biopsy.",

Active asymptomatic sinus infection at the time of admission carries a high risk and must be treated prior to initiation of the conditioning regimen. Central nervous system (CNS) complications are also common after BMT and may be related to the chemotherapy and/or radiation given to treat the underlying malignancy or may be specifically due to transplant-related complications. The only effective way to sort it out is having an underlying evaluation prior to the admission for transplant. The current standard method used to evaluate the patients pre-BMT is head and sinus computerized tomography (CT). However, this method is not accurate to demonstrate subtle CNS abnormalities and white matter diseases. Moreover, CT exposes the patient to radiation, which varies from 0.02 to 0.1 Gy. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), despite much better sensitivity for white matter abnormalities, cannot be routinely used due to the higher cost and longer duration of the exam.

Objective To review our initial experience of the additional information provided by 18F-FDG PET-CT above conventional CT in adolescent patients with Hodgkin's disease. Materials and methods Consecutive paediatric patients with Hodgkin's disease who underwent PET-CT imaging as part of disease assessment were identified retrospectively from an institutional database. The findings were compared with the corresponding diagnostic quality CT performed within 2 weeks of the PET-CT. Results During the study period from May 2007 to January 2009, 33 PET-CT scans were performed in 15 patients. Three scans were omitted from the study because no corresponding CT scan was available for comparison. The age range of the patients was 9 years to 19 years. Tweenty-three (77%) scans were performed to assess response to treatment and 7 (23%) scans for baseline staging. PET-CT provided additional information in 24 (80%) scans: in 10 (33%) scans PET-CT more accurately characterised the presence of disease or detected additional sites of disease and in 11 (37%) scans PET-CT confirmed remission in patients with residual structural abnormality.
