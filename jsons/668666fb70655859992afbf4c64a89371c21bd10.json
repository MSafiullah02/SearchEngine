However, steppe grasslands face desertification or degradation caused by human over-activity. In the last decades, steppe regions have seen increased areas of crop cultivation and subsequent abandonment due to inappropriate agricultural management. Land degradation of abandoned croplands has become a common problem in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. A field survey was conducted in the Xilingol steppe, and vegetation was classified into three groups. Based on comparisons of species composition and soil characters, group 1 represents steppe grassland, group 2 represents abandoned croplands and group 3 represents yardangs. The typical indicator species of steppe, abandoned croplands and yardangs are Leymus chinensis, Cleistogenes squarrosa and Elymus dahuricus, respectively. Abandoned croplands are exposed to wind and rain, resulting in soil erosion, which not only increases coarse sand content but also decreases total carbon and total nitrogen in the soil. We found that soil condition is an important factor affecting the early stages of secondary succession in abandoned croplands and that farming in typical steppes might contribute to land degradation. We concluded that abandoned croplands can be converted to yardangs by erosion. The extension of yardangs might then lead to desertification in steppe regions. Land managers should be aware that farming in typical steppes is associated with a risk of desertification. The degree of degradation of steppe can be measured by monitoring these indicator species.",

The east Eurasian steppe has been used by pastoral nomads for long periods of time (Dulamsuren et al. 2005) . However, steppe grasslands are facing desertification or degradation caused by human over-activity (He et al. 2005) . In China, vast areas of grassland have been converted to cropland due to the increased human population during the last 50 years (Nan 2005) , and many of the croplands have been abandoned subsequently due to the degradation caused by inappropriate agricultural management (Tong et al. 2004 ). The conversion of steppe grassland into cropland undoubtedly impacts steppe ecosystems (Laryea and Unger 1995) . The destruction of steppe vegetation has caused increasing desertification in northern China (Chunru 1989) . In Inner Mongolia, although many cases of desertification arise from overgrazing of livestock, desertification from abandoned cropland is also a serious problem. The restoration of vegetation cover following desertification is usually difficult Jiao et al. 2007) .",

Soil erosion occurs easily when soil surfaces are not covered (Hupy 2004; Su et al. 2004a) , whereas plant and litter coverage protects soil surfaces from erosion (Michels et al. 1995; Fearnehough et al. 1998; Liang et al. 2002) . The frequency and intensity of dust storms are increasing because of the interactions between climate change and human disturbance (Li and Liu 2003) . With global climate change, erosion will become a more serious problem because low-productivity cropland will be abandoned and exposed to wind and water (e.g. rainfall).",

However, no useful countermeasures exist because there is no specific gauge for monitoring soil degradation. In addition, cost-effective indices of soil degradation are needed. To develop a specific gauge, we investigated the relationships between plant communities and soil degradation. This specific gauge was developed from observations and comparisons of plant species under various ecological conditions (Mitchell et al. 1999; Oba et al. 2001) . Using plant indicators would be one of the easiest and least expensive ways to accomplish soil degradation monitoring. We believe that promoting and maintaining vegetation cover following agricultural abandonment are important aspects of steppe management. The restoration of steppe ecosystems requires an understanding of steppe degradation after cropland abandonment (H\u00f6lzel et al. 2002) .",

Typical steppe was located in areas that had never been cultivated, and this is the control vegetation in this study. Abandoned cropland was located in areas that had been cultivated recently. The word yardang is of Turkish origin, meaning ''steep bank'' (Hedin 1903) . Yardangs were located in areas that were recently abandoned cropland plots, but in which bare sand dunes occurred. We recognized 41 typical steppe plots, 58 abandoned cropland plots and 16 yardang plots.",

E. dahuricus is widespread in steppe and has a strong tolerance for dry and saline soils, cold and erosion (Ma et al. 1994) . It is thought that this species can survive in challenging environments such as yardangs. Other species are typical weeds in croplands, and we observed these species regardless of yardang presence. Therefore, E. dahuricus is the most responsive indicator species for yardangs (Table 5 ). S. collina had the highest frequency in yardangs, but this species was not an indicator of this habitat type. S. collina can grow in a wide range of environmental conditions because of its high tolerance to ecological stress (Pyankov et al. 2000) .",

The direct effect of ploughing cropland accounts for a decrease in soil nitrogen (Lobe et al. 2001) . Ploughing results in large nutrient losses caused by reduced plant coverage. The indirect effects of farming lead to erosion through the removal of nutrient-rich topsoil, which can be a major cause of coarser surface soil texture and decreased soil quality in the Horqin Sandy Land of Inner Mongolia (Li et al. 2004) . Topsoil includes important nutrient sources, but it is difficult for plants to establish on unstable substrates like sand. The percentages of total C and total N were further lower in yardangs (group 3) than in abandoned croplands (group 2), although there was no significant difference in total C because of the large variance among the samples within each group. These facts suggest that decreases in total C and total N are strongly related to erosion. Our results also suggest a high risk of decreased total C and total N due to farming.",

However, group 3 will occur naturally following abandonment of cropland and in areas of weak resistance to erosion. Soil erosion of abandoned croplands promotes the occurrence of yardangs. Group 3 was characterized by coarse soil particle size. An increasingly coarse sand ratio in surface soils results from erosion Su et al. 2004b) . Fine sand, which determines water-retention capacity, is lost easily by erosion (Scott 1995) . The structure of loess soils does not vary, so differences in soil erodibility are attributable mainly to variation in particle size distributions, among which silt and clay content are the most important factors . Soil particle size affects soil moisture and strongly influences species composition in steppes. Therefore, how to control soil erosion and improve soil moisture for plant is a key issue of land management in this region (Fu et al. 2003) . These findings imply that yardangs in steppe in semiarid regions represent an extremely severe state of grassland degradation.",
