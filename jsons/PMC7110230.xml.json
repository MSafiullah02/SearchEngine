            "text": "The current article presents the preclinical pharmacology of marine natural products during 2007\u20138 maintaining the format used in the previous reviews (Mayer and Lehmann, 2000, Mayer and Hamann, 2002, Mayer and Hamann, 2004, Mayer and Hamann, 2005, Mayer et al., 2007, Mayer et al., 2009). The preclinical pharmacology of antitumor and cytotoxic marine compounds has been reported in separate reviews (Mayer, 1999, Mayer and Lehmann, 2001, Mayer and Gustafson, 2003, Mayer and Gustafson, 2004, Mayer and Gustafson, 2006, Mayer and Gustafson, 2008). We have restricted the current as well as previous reviews to peer-reviewed articles reporting the bioactivity or pharmacology of structurally characterized marine compounds. As we have done previously, we have continued to use a modification of Schmitz's chemical classification (Schmitz et al., 1993) to assign marine natural product structures to six major chemical classes, namely, polyketides, terpenes, peptides, alkaloids, shikimates, and sugars. Novel antibacterial, anticoagulant, antifungal, antimalarial, antiprotozoal, antituberculosis and antiviral preclinical pharmacology of marine metabolites are presented in Table 1\nwith the corresponding structures shown in Fig. 1\n. Marine compounds that affect the immune and nervous systems, as well as those with anti-inflammatory effects are grouped in Table 2\n, with their corresponding structures presented in Fig. 2\n. Finally, marine compounds that have been demonstrated to affect a variety of cellular and molecular targets are exhibited in Table 3\n, and their structures depicted in Fig. 3\n. Several articles were published during 2007\u20138 reporting the preclinical pharmacology of extracts or structurally uncharacterized marine compounds, and although these have not been included in the present review, they probably may warrant further investigation: antimicrobial effects of the Turkish red alga Jania rubens (Karabay-Yavasoglu et al., 2007); antimicrobial activity in Portuguese marine cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. and Synechococcus sp. extracts towards Gram-positive bacteria (Martins et al., 2008); antibacterial activity against human and fish bacteria from the sub-Arctic colonial ascidian Synoicum pulmonaria from northern Norway (Tadesse et al., 2008); strong antibiotic-producing potential in actinomycetes from sediments in the Trondheim fjord in Norway (Bredholt et al., 2008); antibacterial activity of deep-sea bacteria from sediments of the West Pacific Ocean (Xu et al., 2007); potent antimicrobial activity in the green alga Enteromorpha intestinalis collected in Gujarat, India (Nair et al., 2007); a nonhemolytic antimicrobial lipopeptide derived from the marine bacterium Bacillus circulans (Das et al., 2008); a T-antigen binding lectin with bioactivity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria from the sea cucumber Holothuria scabra (Gowda et al., 2008); anticoagulant activity of a 100\u2013500 kDa polysaccharide isolated from the fermented red seaweed Lomentaria catenata which was greater than the clinical anticoagulant heparin (Pushpamali et al., 2008); antimycobacterial activity in long-chain fatty acids isolated from the red alga Polysiphonia virgata (Saravanakumar et al., 2008); antileishmanial and anti-trichomonal activity in organic extracts of several Mexican red and brown algae (Freile-Pelegrin et al., 2008, Moo-Puc et al., 2008); anti-HIV-1 activity of novel sulfated galactans isolated from the Chinese red algae Grateloupia longifolia and Grateloupia filicina (Wang et al., 2007a, Wang et al., 2007b); significant anti-herpes simplex virus activity in a 30 kDa polysaccharide isolated from the red alga Gracilaria corticata (Chattopadhyay et al., 2008); immunomodulatory effects of an enzymatic extract from the South Korean marine brown alga Ecklonia cava on murine splenocytes (Ahn et al., 2008); immunostimulant properties of a sulfated polysaccharide isolated from the Brazilian red alga Champia feldmannii (Assreuy et al., 2008); antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the Indian red and brown seaweed methanolic extracts with high phenolic contents (Devi et al., 2008); and decreased expression of key regulatory genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways by the lipid extract of the cyanobacterium Nostoc commune var. sphaeroides K\u00fctzing (Rasmussen et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Only six papers provided detailed mechanism of action studies with marine antimicrobial compounds. Kanoh et al. (2008b) reported the discovery of the novel bioactive spirodioxynaphthalene ascochytatin (1) isolated from cultures of a marine-derived fungus Ascochyta sp. NGB4, which inhibited B. subtilis growth (MID = 0.3 \u03bcg/disk) by targeting the function of the bacterial growth regulatory system TCS (YycG/YycF). Kitani et al. (2008) discovered that the 120 kDa acidic glycoprotein l-amino acid oxidase termed SSAP (2), isolated from the rockfish Sebastes schlegelli (Kitani et al., 2007), acted selectively on Gram-negative bacteria (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.078\u20130.63 \u03bcg/mL). While H2O2 was shown to mediate the antibacterial action of SSAP, electron microscopy analysis revealed that SSAP induced cell surface damage and morphological changes in several bacterial species. Lee et al., 2007a, Lee et al., 2007b reported that the 21-residue peptide arenicin-1 (3) isolated from the marine polychaete Arenicola marina exhibited significant antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 2 \u03bcg/mL). Interestingly, arenicin-1 induced release of calcein from PE/PG liposomes, thus suggesting that the bacterial cell membrane is the main molecular target of the peptide. Jang et al. (2007c) extended the pharmacology of the alkaloid isoaaptamine (4), isolated from the marine sponge Aaaptos aaptos. Isoaaptamine inhibited sortase A (IC50\n = 3.7 \u03bcg/mL), an enzyme involved in S. aureus cell wall protein anchoring and virulence, thus potentially providing a novel lead compound \u201cfor further development\u201d of potent antibacterials. Lee et al. (2008) isolated seven sesterterpenes (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) from a tropical sponge Dysidea sp. which demonstrated antibacterial activity against B. subtilis (MIC = 1.56\u201312.5 \u03bcg/mL) by inhibiting isocitrate lyase activity, a key enzyme in the glyoxylate cycle which is present in most prokaryotes, lower eukaryotes and plants, but not in vertebrates. Kanoh et al. (2008a) described a new sulfoalkylresorcinol (12) isolated from the marine-derived fungus Zygosporium sp. KNC52, which showed antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The mechanism of action appeared to involve inhibition (IC50\n = 12.5 \u03bcg/mL) of the in vitro polymerization of FtsZ, a protein which is a structural homolog of eukaryotic tubulin, and that participates in bacterial cell division.",

(2007b) characterized a novel 7.7 kDa anticoagulant polypeptide termed TGAP with a partial sequence (34) from the muscle protein of the South Korean bivalve Tegillarca granosa. The anticoagulant polypeptide, which demonstrated low in vitro cytotoxicity to venous endothelial cells, specifically inhibited the blood coagulation factor Va, as well as the molecular interaction between factor IIa and factor Va in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50\n = 77.9 nM), thus resulting in prolonged prothrombin time. The same research group (Jung et al., 2007a) extended the anticoagulant pharmacology of a sulfated polysaccharide from the brown alga E. cava. The sulfated algal polysaccharide potently inhibited the biological activity of human blood coagulation factors IIa, VIIa and Xa in the presence of the glycoprotein antithrombin III in a dose-dependent manner (KD\n = 15.1, 45.0 and 65.0 nM, respectively). Yoon et al. (2007) reported the purification of a complex and heterogeneous sulfated fucan from the brown alga Laminaria cichorioides. The purified polysaccharide had potent anticoagulant activity which resulted from enhancement of thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II, within the same concentration range as the clinically used heparin. Mao et al. (2008) described two sulfated polysaccharides WF1 (870 kDa) and WF3 (70 kDa) from the marine green alga Monostroma nitidum which demonstrated high anticoagulant activities. Interestingly, both polysaccharides inhibited thrombin as well as potentiated antithrombin III-mediated inhibition of coagulation factor Xa.",

Zhang et al., 2008a, Zhang et al., 2008b identified two new dimeric naphtha-\u03b3-pyrones 8\u2032-O-demethylnigerone (58) and 8\u2032-O-demethylisonigerone (59) from the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus carbonarius which showed weak antimycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis (H37Rv, MIC = 43 and 21.5 \u03bcM, respectively). Interestingly, the presence of conjugated C=C\u2013C=O bonds in the pyrane ring appeared to be crucial for antifungal activity. As a result of a continued investigation of the Caribbean sea whip Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, Wei et al. (2007a) reported that the novel tricarbocyclic norditerpenes caribenols A (60) and B (61) weakly inhibited M. tuberculosis (H37Rv, MIC = 128 and 63 \u03bcg/mL, respectively). Furthermore, Wei et al. (2007b) discovered two novel ring B abeo-sterols parguesterols A (62) and B (63) in the Caribbean sponge Svenzea zeai, which inhibited M. tuberculosis (H37Rv, MIC = 7.8 and 11.2 \u03bcg/mL, respectively). Hopefully future information on the selectivity index of these two compounds will provide additional information to support the notion that they might \u201cconstitute important lead structures for the development of novel tuberculosis drugs due to their strong activity, specificity, and low toxicity\u201d. Berrue et al.

Although all of these studies demonstrate that marine terpenes and polyketides constitute potentially novel antituberculosis leads, they unfortunately did not provide detailed mechanism of action pharmacology at the time of their publication.",

Cirne-Santos et al. (2008) extended the molecular pharmacology of the diterpene dolabelladienetriol (70) isolated from the marine brown alga Dictyota pfaffii. The dolabellane diterpene blocked both synthesis and integration of the HIV-1 provirus by noncompetitively inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme (Ki\n = 7.2 \u03bcM). The investigators proposed dolabelladienetriol (70) as a \u201cpotential new agent for anti-HIV-1 therapy\u201d. Plaza et al. (2007) described three new depsipeptides mirabamides A, C and D (71, 72, 73) isolated from the sponge Siliquariaspongia mirabilis that potently inhibited both HIV-1 in neutralization (IC50\n = 0.14\u20130.19 \u03bcM) and HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell fusion (IC50\n = 0.14\u20133.9 \u03bcM), suggesting these compounds act at an early stage of HIV-1 cell infection, \u201cpresumably through interactions with HIV-1 envelope proteins\u201d. Lu et al. (2007) added a \u201cnovel mechanistic profiling\u201d of the previously reported sulfated polymannuroguluronate (SPMG) (74), a polysaccharide with an average molecular weight of 8.0 kDa isolated from the brown alga Laminaria japonica, that has been reported to be in Phase II clinical trials in China as an anti-AIDS drug candidate. SPMG appeared to eliminate the viral gene product known as transactivator of transcription protein (Tat)-induced signal transduction as well as angiogenesis in AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma cells. Furthermore, in 2008, Hui et al. (2008) demonstrated that SPMG appeared to show a neuroprotective effect because it decreased apoptosis caused by Tat-stimulated calcium overload in PC12 neuronal cells, thus suggesting SPMG might warrant further clinical studies in HIV-associated dementia.",

            "text": "The anti-inflammatory pharmacology of marine compounds reported during 2007\u20138 showed a considerable increase from our previous review (Mayer et al., 2009), and previous reviews of this series. Several marine natural products were shown in preclinical pharmacological studies to target arachidonic metabolism in neutrophils and macrophages. Pearce et al. (2007a) reported two new tricyclic alkaloids ascidiathiazone A (75) and B (76) isolated from a New Zealand ascidian Aplidium species that affected superoxide production by human neutrophils in vitro (IC50\n = 0.44\u20131.55 \u03bcM), as well as murine peritoneal neutrophis ex vivo, with concomitant \u201clow or nonexistent\u201d liver and renal toxicity, thus suggesting that these two compounds might become \u201cpotential anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical\u201d leads. Chao et al. (2008) identified the new cembranolides crassumolides A and C (77, 78) from the soft coral Lobophytum crassum which inhibited expression of iNOS and COX-2 (apparent IC50 less than 10 \u03bcM). Similarly, from the same university, Cheng et al. (2008) found that new cembranolides from the soft coral Lobophytum duru, durumolides A\u2013C (79, 80, 81) inhibited both the iNOS and COX-2 proteins in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells in vitro (apparent IC50 less than 10 \u03bcM), suggesting that the \u03b1-methylene-\u03b3-lactone moiety of these compounds was necessary for the observed activity. Shen et al. (2007) showed that new briarane-type diterpenoids frajunolides B and C (82, 83), isolated from the Taiwanese gorgonian Junceella fragilis, significantly inhibited superoxide anion and elastase generation from human neutrophils in vitro (apparent IC50 greater than 10 \u03bcg/mL). Dang et al. (2008) demonstrated that the previously described fatty acids (84, 85) from the South Korean marine red alga Gracilaria verrucosa inhibited release by LPS-activated murine macrophages of the inflammatory nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin-6 (apparent IC50 less than 20 \u03bcg/mL), thus revealing that the conjugated enone moiety played a critical role in the anti-inflammatory activity observed in vitro.\nBittencourt et al. (2008) contributed novel preclinical pharmacology on a previously reported 90 amino acid polypeptide (86) isolated from the red alga Hypnea cervicornis. The mucin-binding agglutinin, which was extensively characterized with several in vivo models of nociception and inflammation, probably exerted its anti-inflammatory activity (apparent IC50\n = 0.1\u20131 mg/kg) via interaction of the polypeptide with the lectin carbohydrate-binding site, although the exact mechanism of action remains undetermined. El Sayed et al. (2008) demonstrated that manzamine A (87), (\u2212)-8-hydroxymanzamine A (88), and hexahydro-8-hydroxymanzamine A (89) potently inhibited TXB2 generation (IC50\n = 0.25, less than 0.1, and 1.97 \u03bcM, respectively) in brain microglia. These findings provide further support to the notion that manzamine alkaloids appear to be \u201cviable anti-inflammatory leads\u201d for the preclinical pharmaceutical development of agents to modulate both activated brain microglia and eicosanoid generation. Treschow et al. (2007) investigated four novel \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (90, 91, 92, 93) from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel Perna canaliculus with an in vitro bioassay that used stimulated human neutrophil 5-lipoxygenase, demonstrating that the putative anti-inflammatory potential of these compounds might be related to inhibition of leukotriene and prostaglandin metabolite production. Sansom et al. (2007) reported a bis-prenylated quinone (94) from the New Zealand brown alga Perithalia capillaris which inhibited superoxide anion production in human neutrophils (IC50\n = 2.1 \u03bcM) in vitro, with low toxicity. An explanation as to why the authors decided not to investigate the quinone \u201cas an anti-inflammatory lead\u201d remains unclear, although it was strongly cytotoxic towards human leukemia cells (IC50\n = 0.34 \u03bcM). Sugiura et al. (2007) characterized a novel anti-allergic phlorotannin phlorofucofuroeckol B (PFF-B) (95) from the edible brown alga Eisenia arborea. PFF-B, inhibited \u03b2-hexosaminidase release from rat basophilic leukemia cells (IC50\n = 7.8 \u03bcM) in vitro, thus showing higher potency than Tranilast (Rizaben\u00ae) (IC50\n = 46.6 \u03bcM), a pharmaceutical agent used for treatment of allergic disorders such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in Japan and South Korea. Kossuga et al. (2008) demonstrated that the polyketide plakortide P (54) isolated from the Brazilian sponge P. angulospiculatus, potently inhibited thromboxane B2 release (IC50\n = 0.93 \u03bcM) from activated rat brain microglia, thus extending the preclinical pharmacology of this compound, which besides being antiparasitic as discussed earlier in this review, also appears to be a potentially \u201cnovel antineuroinflammatory agent\u201d. Pearce et al. (2007b) examined a halogenated furanone rubrolide O (96) isolated from a New Zealand ascidian Synoicum n. sp., which inhibited superoxide anion production in human neutrophils (IC50\n = 35 \u03bcM) in vitro with low toxicity. Although rubrolides have been reported to be cytotoxic and antibacterial, the authors proposed that the anti-inflammatory activity for these tunicate metabolites though moderate was \u201cunprecedented\u201d. Khan et al. (2007) identified a \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid stearidonic acid (97) from the South Korean brown seaweed Undaria pinnatifida, which was shown to be very active against PMA-induced mouse ear inflammation symptoms, edema, erythema and blood flows (IC50\n = 160, 314 and 235 \u03bcg/per ear, respectively). The in vivo data compared well with indomethacin which was used as a positive control (IC50\n = 90, 172, 179 \u03bcg/per ear, respectively), and thus supported claims that this \u201cseaweed can be used as a remedy for inflammation-related symptoms\u201d. Kobayashi et al. (2007a) discovered a novel dimeric oroidin derivative carteramine A (98) in the marine sponge Stylissa carteri, and showed that it inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis (IC50\n = 5 \u03bcM). The authors suggested that because carteramine A has no structural resemblance to known compounds that inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis, their finding provides a \u201cnovel platform to develop a new class of anti-inflammatory agents\u201d. Taori et al. (2007) identified three new analogues of dolastatin 13, lyngbyastatins 5\u20137 (99, 100, 101), isolated from marine cyanobacteria Lyngbya spp. from South Florida. Although the three compounds selectively and potently inhibited porcine pancreatic elastase (IC50\n = 3\u201310 nM), suggesting a potential therapeutic use in pathophysiological conditions where elastase overactivity is involved, no mechanism of action studies were reported at the time. Oh et al. (2008) purified a novel polyketide salinipyrone A (102) from the marine actinomycete Salinispora pacifica, which moderately inhibited interleukin-5 (IC50\n = 10 \u03bcg/mL) in a mouse splenocyte model of allergic inflammation, with low cell cytotoxicity.",

            "text": "\nKawauchi et al. (2007) investigated the red pigment cycloprodigiosin hydrochloride (103) isolated from the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas denitrificans. Interestingly, the compound suppressed activator protein 1 (AP-1) (apparent IC50\n = 1 \u03bcM), and downstream gene expression of interleukin 8, a chemokine involved in the innate immune system. Courtois et al. (2008) assessed the effect of the known compound floridoside (104), isolated from the French red alga Mastocarpus stellatus on the complement system. Floridoside was observed to potently activate the classical complement pathway (apparent IC50\n = 5.9\u20139.3 \u03bcg/mL) by recruiting immunoglobulin M (IgM), suggesting that the compound might be an \u201cimportant step in the development of a potent new anticomplementary agent\u201d useful in therapy aimed at addressing complement depletion. Greve et al. (2007) reported that the novel iso-iantheran A and 8-carboxy-iso-iantheran A (105, 106) purified from the Australian marine sponge Ianthella quadrangulata demonstrated agonist activity at P2Y11 receptors (IC50\n = 1.29 and 0.48 \u03bcM, respectively). This finding represents an interesting contribution to ionotropic purine receptor P2Y11 pharmacology, because these receptors have been shown to affect the maturation and differentiation of dendritic cells. Huh et al. (2007) extended the pharmacology of prodigiosin (107) isolated from the marine bacterium Hahella chejuencis collected in South Korea. Prodigiosin inhibited iNOS mRNA expression and NO production (apparent IC50\n = 0.1 \u03bcg/mL) by a mechanism that involved inhibition of NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation. He et al. (2007) characterized the pharmacology of a water soluble polysaccharide (108) isolated from the mollusc Arca subcrenata Lischke, a popular Chinese seafood, and named it ASLP. ASLP stimulated mouse spleen lymphocyte proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner (apparent IC50 less than 100 \u03bcg/mL), and with the \u201cbranches of ASLP\u201d being required for the immunomodulatory bioactivity. Aminin et al. (2008) described the immunostimulant activity of frondoside A (109), a triterpene glycoside isolated from the sea cucumber Cucumaria frondosa. The glycoside was shown to stimulate lysosomal activity and phagocytosis in mouse macrophages, as well as reactive oxygen species formation. Oda et al. (2007) provided novel information on the molecular mechanisms affected by smenospongidine, smenospongiarine and smenospongine (110, 111, 112), sesquiterpene quinones previously isolated from a Palauan marine sponge Hippospongia sp. The observation that at 10 \u03bcg/mL, these compounds promoted interleukin-8 release, a member of the C\u2013X\u2013C chemokine superfamily which is involved in tumor progression and metastasis, suggested that \u201cthe functional group at C-18\u201d might play a yet undetermined role in the observed results. Yamada et al. (2007) isolated the novel macrosphelide M (113) and peribysin J (114) from Periconia byssoides, a fungal strain discovered from the sea hare Aplysia kurodai. Significantly, both fungal metabolites inhibited the adhesion of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (IC50\n = 33.2 and 11.8 \u03bcM, respectively) more potently than herbimycin A (IC50\n = 38 \u03bcM). The latter compound, a benzochinoid ansamycin antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces sp. was used as a positive control in these studies. Lu et al. (2008) contributed a novel cembranolide querciformolide C (115) from the soft coral Sinularia querciformis, which significantly inhibited the activation of the iNOS and COX-2 enzymes (apparent IC50 less than 10 \u03bcM) in LPS-activated murine macrophages in vitro. Ponomarenko et al. (2007) discovered that new diterpenoids (116, 117) isolated from a Northern Cook Islands marine sponge Spongia (Heterofibria) sp. moderately activated murine splenocytes lysosomes (apparent IC50 greater than 100 \u03bcg/mL). Oh et al. (2007) characterized a novel cyclic peptide thalassospiramide B (118) isolated from a marine bacterium Thalassospira sp., which showed immunosuppressive activity in an interleukin-5 (IL-5) inhibition assay (IC50\n = 5 \u03bcM); an interesting finding because IL-5 is expressed both in eosinophils and mast cells in asthmatic patients.",

Contributing to the ongoing search for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Langjae et al. (2007) reported a new stigmastane-type steroidal alkaloid 4-acetoxy-plakinamine B (130), isolated from a Thai marine sponge Corticium sp. that significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (IC50\n = 3.75 \u03bcM). Compound 130 was reported to be the \u201cfirst marine-derived acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting steroidal alkaloid\u201d with a mechanism of action involving an unusual mixed-competitive mode of inhibition. Choi et al. (2007) extended the molecular pharmacology of two known meroditerpenes, sargaquinoic acid (131) and sargachromenol (132) isolated from the brown alga S. sagamianum. Sargaquinoic acid potently inhibited butyrylcholinesterase (IC50\n = 26 nM), a novel target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, with potency comparable to or greater than anticholinesterases in current clinical use.\nHui et al. (2008) further characterized the neuroprotective effects of the polysaccharide sulfated polymannuroguluronate (SPMG) (74), noted earlier as currently being in Phase II clinical trials in China as an anti-AIDS drug candidate. SPMG appeared to decrease the Tat-stimulated calcium overload in PC12 neuronal cells as well as concomitant apoptosis-signaling cascades, thus demonstrating a potential for further clinical development as a therapeutic intervention in HIV-associated dementia.",
