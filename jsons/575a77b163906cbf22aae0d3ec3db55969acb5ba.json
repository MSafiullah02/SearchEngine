The catch provided 14% of the world's need for animal protein, 4-5% of the total protein requirements, but less than 1 % of the nutritional energy needs (Whittle 1984) . Fish is a good source of minerals such as calcium, phosphorous and iron, trace elements like iodine (in marine species), as well as vitamins. The high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids contributes significantly to the essential fatty acid requirements and, in addition, probably helps lower cholesterol levels. Thus, fish is important in the diet of the developing world. Within developing countries there is a recognizable trend for the poor to spend proportionally more of their household expenditure for animal protein on fish rather thmon other meat products (James 1984) .",

If reduction in losses are to be achieved, money will have to be invested in improving the fresh fish distribution system. Given modem technology and sufficient resources, it is possible to conserve food commodities for extended periods of time without loss. A potentially economically and technologically viable method for reducing fresh fish losses is the use of chemical preservatives and modified atmospheres (MA) in addition to ice or refrigeration. Both preservatives and MA can reduce bacterial growth, extend the allowable transit time, provide a higher quality end product and reduce economic losses.",

            "text": "As described by Hobbs (1982) , when a fish dies, some of the enzymes in the muscle continue to perform their functions, including those that maintain the muscle in a state of readiness to contract. The energy for contraction comes from the glycogen stored in the muscle. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is split rapidly to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a phosphorous group (P) by the Mgactivated actomyosin ATPase. The free energy derived from the splitting of ATP in living tissue is used for contraction. The development of power occurs through the sliding of the actin and myosin filaments past one another. Postmortem the ATP is eventually not restored by other chemical reactions. In the absence of ATP, permanent actomyosin crosslinks are formed. This action results in the stiffening of fish associated with rigor mortis that remains until enzymatic activity, probably proteolysis, releases the tension elsewhere. The release of tension is referred to as the resolution of rigor @endall 1969). The fish's backbone prevents the muscle from shortening in the whole fish; but if a fillet is removed before rigor mortis is fully established, the muscle tissue will shorten, perhaps by as much as 40% of its original length (Hobbs 1982) . The muscle passing into rigor mortis becomes rigid and inextensible and any forcible attempt to stretch it is then accompanies by fracture, usually in the I-band of the sarcomere (Bendall 1969) .",

Some fish species, e.g., herring, mackerel, and capelin caught during periods of heavy feeding, are very susceptible to autolytic tissue degradation. The usual explanation has been that fish with high amounts of stomach and gut content also have high activities of digestive enzymes. These leak out postmortem by the bursting of the belly walls and degrade the surrounding tissues (Gildberg and Raa 1980) . \"Eklly Burst\" and its effects can be reduced by keeping the fish cool and processing quickly, especially by gutting the fish soon after catching (Hobbs 1982) . Love and Lavety (1972) and Gildberg (1978) pointed out that the state of the connective tissue has an important role in the phenomena since heavy feeding fish have a weaker connective tissue than starving fish. The connective tissue is relatively weak if the postmortem tissue pH is low and observations indicate that postmortem tissue pH is lowest when fish are caught during heavy feeding periods (Gildberg 1978) .",

These bacteria are predominantly at the surface of the fish but secrete enzymes into the tissues, bringing about a complex series of chemical changes (Shewan 1977) . The microflora of fresh fish initially use many of the low molecular weight substances in the tissue (carbohydrates, free amino acids, small peptides and lactic acid) as a source of energy for further growth (Gill and Newton 1977) . The Pseudomonas-Achromobacter group rapidly metabolize most amino acids, dipeptides and tripeptides found in the nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) fraction of muscle. Oxidative deamination of amino acids seems to be the primary pathway leading to ammonia and volatile fatty acids accumulation (Liston 1982) . Proteolysis does not seem to be significant in the early stages of spoilage because the high concentration of NPN (free amino acids) apparently inhibits the proteinases (Chung 1968 ). Proteolysis become more important in the later stages of spoilage when most of the free amino acids have been depleted.",

However, burbot ( h t a lota) , the only freshwater gadoid fish does seem to have TMAO (Samson 1983) . TMAO is believed to be involved in the osmotic regulation of marine fish, as well as being part of the body's buffer system (Regenstein e? al. 1982) . Hebard e? al. (1982) indicate that Yamada (1967) suggested that TMAO was a waste product in fish, a detoxified form of TMA derived from choline, betaine, methionine, etc. Ogilvie and Warren (1957) suggested that the presence of TMAO in fish was the results of both exogenous and endogenous processes. Salt water fish have varying amounts of TMAO due to differences in the TMAO present in their food but mostly because they must lower their TMAO excretion to the level that counteracts the osmotic pressure of sea water. TMAO degradation is due to the bacterial enzyme triamineoxidase (TAO) which apparently activates the substrate (TMAO) so that a bacterial dehydrogenase can reduce it to TMA. Figure 1 illustrates the TMAO degradation reactions. Among the many potential hydrogen donors, the most important is probably lactic acid (one of the final products of glycolysis) and pyruvic acid. Psychrotrophic bacteria, particularly Achromobacter are capable of reducing TMAO to TMA (Laycock and Regier 1970; Lee et al. 1967 ). However, significant amounts of TMA are not produced until after the bacterial lag phase, which extends from the onset of rigor to its resolution, due to a postulated bacteriostatic effect of rigor mortis. When bacterial counts are sufficiently high, the amount of TMAO reduced to TMA is significant.",

The principal pathway of ATP decomposition in fish is ATP to ADP to AMP to IMP to I to HX (hypoxanthine) to xanthine to uric acid. Generally the reactions involved in converting ATP to IMP took place in the early stage after death or before the ultimate pH is reached. The IMP to inosine step is often rate-limiting. IMP accumulates in fish meat in the early stage after death and acts as a flavor enhancer in the fish (Ikeda 1980) . Inosine and hypoxanthine concentrations increase with time (decrease in freshness). This series of reactions is the basis of the K value test for freshness discussed in Part III.",
