This airport is the gateway to Makkah, through which most of the international pilgrims reach the Sacred Mosque in Makkah. The Hajj terminal of KAAI Airport is specially built to handle pilgrims that take part in the annual Hajj and is designed in the form of tents occupying an area of 465,000 m2. It is the fourth largest airport terminal in the world after Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Seoul. It can receive about 50,000 pilgrims a day in the Hajj season. It consists of 12 indoor halls, which act as arrival and departure lounges for pilgrims. It also consists of various indoor public areas (eg, restaurants, indoor and outdoor shopping areas).",

Biosamplers (SKC Inc, Eighty Four, PA) were used to sample the air at various locations and times in the Hajj terminal as described in Table 1\n. The biosamplers were positioned at 1.5 m from the floor and run at a sampling flow rate of 6 L/min for 2 hours, hence the sampling of 720 L of air in each run. Whereas biosamplers are typically used at a sampling flow rate of 12.5 L/min for bacteria and fungi, the same procedure does not work well for viruses. Instead, lower sampling rates (6-8 L/min) have resulted in increased collection efficiencies for airborne viruses in field and laboratory tests (J. Lednicky, 2010, and C. Y. Wu, 2009 and 2010, unpublished data). Microorganisms were collected in 20 mL of collection media composed of 0.5 weight/volume sterile Bovine Serum Albumin Fraction V (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in a Phosphate Buffered Saline solution (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). The media were then aseptically transferred into sterile polypropylene 50 mL clinical-grade centrifuge tubes and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing.",

Although most air samples were negative for the 22 respiratory pathogens screened for, one sample was positive for influenza B virus. Influenza is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide each year19 and is common during the Hajj.2 Influenza viruses have been shown to survive for days in the environment and can easily be transmitted via droplet, airborne (droplet nuclei), or contact transmission.13, 14, 17 Influenza virus has been detected in different indoor environments (eg, schools, homes, office buildings).17 The low contamination prevalence found in our air samples may be the result of a number of factors, including the restricted range of pathogens screened for, duration of sampling (volume of air sampled), large volume of airport terminal halls and ventilation systems, and environmental conditions (eg, temperature, relative humidity). In addition, because the air samplings were performed at a lower collection flow rate than is optimal for bacteria and fungi, we cannot exclude the possibility that they were not effectively collected by the procedure that was used for this study.",

Goyal et al21 investigated contamination of the air by respiratory viruses in 2 large public buildings in the United States by analyzing the content of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning filters of the air-handling units in the buildings. Nine of the 64 filters tested were positive for influenza A virus, 2 filters were positive for influenza B virus, and 1 filter was positive for parainfluenza virus 1. Soto et al20 performed air sampling to detect bacteria and fungi at representative areas within a Spanish university. Most bacteria identified were gram-positive cocci belonging to the Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. Other bacteria (eg, Neisseria, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter) were also identified. Cladosporium was the predominant genus isolated among fungi, in addition to other genera identified at lower rates (eg, Aspergillus, Candida, Penicillium). The study also reported that in the indoor air, bacterial contamination exceeds fungal contamination and the former originates from humans occupying the indoor space, whereas fungi probably come from exogenous sources.",

The most prevalent fungi isolated were Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Penicillium species, whereas Bacillus, Micrococcus, Shigella, and Pseudomonas species were the predominant bacteria.

Although the introduction of H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines in the late 1980s made a dramatic effect on the incidence of invasive disease among children, cases of vaccine failure and an increased susceptibility to invasive H. influenzae type b and nontype b H. influenzae disease have been consistently reported among individuals with various congenital and acquired immune deficiencies.30 Similarly, M. catarrhalis, another gram-negative bacterium, is an important and common human respiratory tract pathogen that causes 10%-20% of otitis media episodes in children and is the second most common cause of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults.31 Pneumonia caused by M. catarrhalis occurs infrequently but is well described in older adults, especially in those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease.32 A large proportion of Hajj pilgrims are older adults with underlying health conditions, hence these organisms could cause serious invasive infections in such susceptible hosts.",

Sampling at more locations at various times (crowded and quiet times) for longer periods of time using procedures optimized for viruses in parallel with those for bacteria and fungi would improve the likelihood of detection of pathogens and would inform which periods and locations during the Hajj pathogens are most likely to be present in the air or on surfaces. For instance, studies have shown that human activity and densely populated areas have an effect on the density and variety of microorganisms in the environment.20, 23 Our study aimed to detect a set of 22 viral and bacterial pathogens. This meant that other respiratory pathogens, including fungi and other viruses and bacteria not included in the panel, would have been missed. Additionally, because the detection was based on molecular techniques alone, it is unclear whether the detected pathogens were infectious or alive at the time of sampling because direct culturing was not perfumed. On the other hand, there is evidence to support that only a small percentage of microorganisms surviving in natural environments can be cultured and quantified using conventional and standard microbiological media.33 Considering the 22 pathogens screened for in the multiplex assay, individual culture for these same reagents would have been complex and very expensive. Hence, although the use of molecular techniques, similar to the ones we used, may overestimate the presence of viable agents, it is more practical, less expensive, and less complex than a complex, multiple pathogen, direct culture approach. Further investigations, including both molecular and culture techniques, for the detection of a wider range of respiratory and enteric pathogens seem warranted.",
