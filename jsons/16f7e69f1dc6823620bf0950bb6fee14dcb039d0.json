We used \"twoClassSummary\" method to compute sensitivity, specificity and the area under the ROC curve. This NN algorithm was performed 10 times over a matrix of re-sampled patients. Resampled matrices were composed of patients with severe status (outcome = 1) and a random selection of the same number of patients with less severe status (outcome = 0). For each resampled matrix, we performed a 10-fold cross validation where randomly used 90% of patients as the training dataset and the remaining (10%) as the testing dataset. A total of 100 NN models were performed and a ROC curve is calculated for the set of predictions and real values using the 10-fold cross validation. Our final AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated as the mean of the 100 NN models performed in total.

Regarding comorbidities, in agreement with previous data, a past history of arterial hypertension, neurological disorders and diabetes weighed negatively in the outcome of our patients. These comorbidities have been reported in other series 6, 7 which suggest that the virus preferentially targets patients with the so-called metabolic syndrome. In relation to neurological disorders, many authors have argued for a possible tropism of the virus to neural tissue, as indicated by the high prevalence of anosmia and ageusia 8 , but also by frequent cases presenting with encephalitis 9 and strokes 10 . Intriguingly, smoking has not been found to increase risk or severity. Moreover, there are some data pointing to its possible protective role, an effect that has being claimed to rely on nicotine 11 .
