This worry is understandable: up to a point, polarization can help democracies, but when it becomes too vast, such that entire swaths of the population refuse to consider each other's views, this thwarts democratic methods for solving societal problems. Given widespread polarization in America, what lies ahead? We describe two possible futures, each based on different sets of theory and evidence. On one hand, polarization may be on a self-reinforcing upward trajectory fueled by misperception and avoidance; on the other hand it may have recently reached the apex of its pendulum swing. We conclude that it is too early to know which future we are approaching, but that our ability to address misperceptions may be one key factor.",

It encourages civic engagement: Polarized citizens more often vote, protest, and join political movements, all of which are necessary for functioning democracy [15] and help disrupt undesirable status quos [16] . Polarization also entails pluralistic policy alternatives [17] ; this is crucial for democracies, which rely on citizens being able to consider multiple policies and have thorough, constructive debates between them [18] . Ideally, this kind of engagement and pluralism ultimately produce effective, stable government: It helps societies identify policies that are both optimal for solving their biggest problems [89] , and unlikely to be overturned when a new party takes power since they are mutually agreed-upon [85] . 1 Polarization occurs everywhere to varying degrees, among both citizens and elected officials. We focus on polarization among American citizens (for elite polarization, see Refs. [86, 44] ) because of the wealth of empirical studies examining this population over time. With American polarization at record highs, the prevalence and effects described here are likely milder elsewhere; moreover, unique political and cultural factors (e.g., multi-party systems, democratic versus other political systems, media availability) likely influence how polarization manifests [87, 88, 94] .",

For example, if one half of a society begins to embrace morally abhorrent ideas (i.e., white supremacy; Neo-Nazi ideologies), the other half might be justified in polarizing away from them, refusing to engage with or consisder their views. A full philosophical discussion of the morality of polarization falls beyond the scope of this paper (see Refs. [20] [21] [22] ). Nonetheless, in a world where one half of a population refuse to engage with the other, even if this is the most morally correct choice, democratic processes can no longer operate effectively [23, 24] . The only policies considered are those loved by one party and despised by the other; one side eventually ekes out a narrow victory, leaving the other desperate to delegitimize it [25] . In short, when polarization inspires revulsion, democracies run the risk of breaking down. In short, recent psychological findings suggest that Americans are refusing to interact with politically dissimilar others [19] , and are motivated to overlook both the inadequacies in policies they support and the merits of opposing policies. Even if they feel-even if they are-morally justified in both avoiding opponents and their beliefs while doubling down on their own, this carries pragmatic risks [41] . In a system where the two polarized parties represent sizeable portions of the population, democratic processes may lead to suboptimal, oft-overturned policies that inadequately address societal problems [25] .",

Americans accept smaller paychecks to avoid listening to opposing partisans [26 ], move to new places to surround themselves with ideologically similar residents [27], and swipe left on people with whom they disagree politically [28]. Polarized Americans are more willing to exclude people with opposing political beliefs than to exclude people of other races [29,30]-a jarring comparison considering the prevalence of race-based exclusion [31]. Likewise, Americans have trouble critically evaluating the flaws and merits of policies [32]. Instead, they seek information that confirms their partisan preferences [91] and disregardfacts thatcounterthem [33,34].Outof loyalty[35], they treat core party issues as immune to debate [19,36,37] and suppress their opponents' views [38-40].",
