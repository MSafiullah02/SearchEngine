The resultant structure was energy minimized using the DISCOVER module of Insight II (Accelrys) and used as the initial structure. A database of more than 15,000 compounds comprising of protease inhibitors (aspartyl, cysteine, serine, and metallo-proteases), HETATM records extracted from PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/) [30], HIV inhibitors (polymerase, integrase, and reverse transcriptase), and a set of thiol reactive compounds filtered from Maybridge (http://www.maybridge.com), Leadquest (http://www.leadquest.com/), ACD laboratories (http://www.acdlabschem.com), and NCI small-molecule databases (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov) was used in the study. Virtual screening of the small molecule inhibitors against SARS 3Clpro was performed using the FlexX module in SYBYL6.9 (Tripos) set at default parameters unless otherwise indicated in the text. We utilized multiple well-known scoring functions: a GOLD-like function [16], a DOCK-like function [17], ChemScore [18], a PMF function [19], and FlexX [20] to rank order the complexes resulting from virtual screening. A list of top 200 compounds was selected from each scoring function, generated and purged into a dataset of 760 unique compounds. These compounds were subjected to physicochemical filters and merged into single database of 330 compounds. Identified lead molecules were in silico derivatized with suitable thiol reactive warheads. The resultant complexes were subjected to Molecular Dynamics simulations and energy minimization using DISCOVER module of Insight II. Molecular dynamics simulations consisted of an initial equilibration of 5 pico seconds (ps) and followed by 100 ps dynamics at 300 K. The final complex structure at the end of the MD simulation was subjected to 5000 steps of steepest descent energy minimization followed by conjugate gradient energy minimization. For all the above calculations, a distance-dependent dielectric constant and non-bonded distance cutoff of 20 \u00c5 were used. Molecular graphics images were produced using SYBYL6.9 and the UCSF Chimera package from the Computer Graphics Laboratory, University of California, San Francisco (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera; [21]). Inhibitor\u2013protease interactions were analyzed using occluded surface (OS) [22], [23].",

            "text": "Designing specific inhibitors to block SARS 3CLpro requires a clear understanding of the successful inhibitors designed against class of cysteine proteases. The first set of specific covalent inhibitors for proteases has been designed by adding reactive warheads such as diazo compounds or haloketones to a good substrate of the protease under concern. One of the major disadvantages in using early covalent inhibitors such as haloketones arises due to the inherent reactivity towards non-target molecules. This compromises their stability/selectivity and in turn makes them unsuitable for in vivo studies. The discovery of E64, potent natural epoxysuccinyl inhibitor and Michael acceptors such as AG7088, has shown that lowering the reactivity of the warhead essentially increases the stability, inhibitory potency, and in turn makes them viable for in vivo studies. The entry of AG7088 into clinical trials [24], [25], [26] has rejuvenated the interest in developing irreversible covalent inhibitors for cysteine proteases. Essentially the first step is the subsite mapping with a library of peptide substrates [27]. In lieu of such studies, it is often easier to identify the potential substrate peptide from closer homologues within the family of the protease. A closer examination of the substrate specificity profile of 3C-like proteases of coronaviruses reveals that P1\u2032 position of the substrate is usually small (Gly, Ala or Ser), a conserved Gln at the P1 position, and the P2 position of the substrates seems to favor large hydrophobic residues. The side chains of His163 and Phe140 and the main-chain atoms of Met165, Glu166, and His172 form the S1 subsite, which confers specificity towards Gln. Thus, specific covalent inhibitors of SARS 3CLpro could be designed by substituting the amino acid at the P1\u2032 position with a thiol specific reactive organic moiety like chloromethyl ketone. The affinity for the peptide with correct Pi\u2013Pi\u2032 (where i\n = 1, 2, 3, etc.) amino acid arrangement has always been the highest. The criteria for any small molecule mimic would be to span the critical length required for the inhibition and make critical interactions with the binding site residues. Secondary structure studies using peptide substrates demonstrate that substrates with more \u03b2-sheet like structure tend to react fast [28].",

            "text": "The availability of X-ray crystal structures with bound ligands facilitates computer-assisted design of structural analogues with increased potency. Due to the lack of X-ray crystal structures before July 2003, we constructed several homology models based on TGEV Mpro (PDB ID: 1lvo). Though there were significant differences between the homology models and the available crystal structures, by comparison of RMS deviations of the binding sites of all the structures alone with respect to that of 1uk4, it could be observed that the differences in the binding site are localized to \u2018minor\u2019 loop reorganization and side chain orientations (Fig. 1A\n). Our homology models were comparable with other models available at that time (Fig. 1B, marked I). Early structures 1p9s [5], 1p9t [5], and 1p9u [5] provided structural basis for initial virtual screening efforts. These were based on the assumption that the substrate peptide binds in the normal mode i.e., conserved Si\u2013Pi and Si\u2032\u2013Pi\u2032 interactions (where i\n = 1, 2, 3, etc.). However, in the reported CMK-peptide bound crystal structure, Leu-P2 is partially solvent accessible and does not interact with the S2 subsite. This results in a shift in subsite interaction; Thr-P3 and Asn-P5 occupy the S2 and S4 subsites, respectively. This unusual mode of binding could attribute to lower specificity of the P2-amino acid in comparison with other coronaviruses [11]. The authors have also reported large cooperative movements of the side chains of Glu166, Phe140, Leu141, and Tyr118, and the N terminus of the partner protomer in the dimer as a function of pH. Especially there is a marked difference amongst the structures crystallized at different pH (PDB: 1uj1, 1uk2, 1uk3, and 1uk4; Fig. 1B, marked II). Our earlier virtual screening studies with homology models of the SARS 3CLpro provided clues about potential protease inhibitors.",

This not only reduced about 40% of unwanted molecules but also reduced the computer time taken for virtual screening against the X-ray crystal structure as outlined in Materials and methods. Virtual screening resulted in 330 unique compounds with 157 small molecule hits containing at least one thiol reactive functional group. These compounds could potentially serve as covalent inhibitors of SARS 3CLpro. Analysis of the docked complexes reveals that the thiol reactive functional groups are not properly oriented towards catalytic Cys145 in most of the docked complexes. Out of the 157 complexes only 17 compounds including KZ7088 were oriented properly towards Cys145 but still were 4\u20135 \u00c5 away to induce possible nucleophilic attack. Reorganization of the ligand fragments to provide proper orientation for protease reaction disrupted critical interactions with the binding site residues. In the process, we learnt that it was easier to modify small molecules that do not contain thiol functionality but bind well to the protease pocket.",

Occluded surface is defined as the molecular surface that is less than 2.8 \u00c5 from the surface of neighboring non-bonded atoms. That is, if a water molecule cannot fit between two atoms they occlude each other. Occluded surface is similar to buried surface but is more sensitive to packing geometry than buried surface using a rolling probe. To calculate occluded surface, normals at the molecular surface are extended outward until they intersect neighboring van der Waals surface. The collection of extended normals, and their respective lengths, defines the packing of each atom in a structural model. A combination of occluded surface area and average length of the normals was used to obtain the occluded surface packing (OSP) value for each residue and the analysis of inter-chain occluded surface allows a detailed calculation of protein\u2013protein interactions.",

The OS scores averaged per amino acid give a quantitative measure of the protein\u2013inhibitor interactions. The non-covalent inhibitor does not interact with the catalytic residue His41. The corresponding covalent analogue interacts with His41 better than the CMK peptide (Fig. 6D). Both the CMK peptide and the covalent inhibitor bound to Cys145 have higher OS score for this residue compared to the corresponding non-covalent analogue (Fig. 6D). However, the non-covalent inhibitor interacts with the residues Glu166 and Gln189 better than the covalent and the CMK peptide. It is evident that OS scores could quantitatively differentiate the interactions of covalent and non-covalent analogue of the HIV inhibitors with binding site residues of SARS 3CLpro.",

These molecules could potentially retard the proteolytic action of the SARS protease and be used in combination with other anti-viral therapeutics. Protease inhibitor design has evolved beyond mere addition of reactive warheads to cognate protease substrates. In silico derivatization of viable functional groups as identified by the secondary rule-based screen enables the old drugs to react with Cys145 by serving as centers of nucleophilic attack. The use of low and high reactive organic warheads provides means to control the reactivity of the inhibitor, its stability, inhibitory potency and in turn helps in designing inhibitors viable for in vivo studies. Thus, our strategy not only educates old drugs to kill new bugs but also teaches them to behave according to the needs. Occluded Surfaces generated scores provide unique and novel method for quantitative comparison of non-covalent and covalent inhibitor bound complexes. Unlike with a new drug, old drugs or drugs with minimal modifications do not have to undergo extensive pre-clinical testing to prove their safety, efficacy and have the possibility of gaining accelerated approval by US Food and Drug Administration. Our strategy could be extended to identify potent inhibitors and fine-tune old drugs against other disease targets that are cysteine proteases such as cathepsins, caspases, calpains, and papain.",
