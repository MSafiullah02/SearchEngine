COVID has had its economic impact with hospitals cutting down on elective procedures, impacting patient care and also the revenue generated. One question that has remained largely unanswered in all guidelines is whether we should routinely test for COVID before elective and semiurgent endoscopies. India is a unique healthcare setting with costs of healthcare interventions being very low. 3 Average upper GI endoscopy costs in India is between Rs. 2000 to Rs. 4000 (~30 to 60 U.S. dollars). Colonoscopy costs are between Rs. 7000 to Rs. 10000 (~100 to 140 U.S. dollars).",

Also, the report may not be available right away considering pool testing done at various centers. The low endoscopy costs and higher PCR test costs may not justify testing for all with PCR. The population prevalence in India is approximately 3.6 per 100,000 as compared with 122 per 100,000 in the study by Corral et al. The chances of disease detection fall significantly, considering the low prevalence. The disease prevalence in high-risk pockets like Mumbai are close to 70 per 100,000 population, which is much less than the prevalence in the study previously quoted. However, an important consideration becomes the fact that disease prevalence is likely to increase further. Hence, testing for all may not be the right strategy at the moment. However, constant appraisal of the situation will guide us better for further policy decisions on testing. Adequate screening before patient assessment and endoscopy remains the cornerstone for prevention. Clinical judgement should take credence over laboratory investigations to decide necessity of investigations. The prudent use of PPE appropriate to the risk setting remains imperative and cannot be overemphasized. We designed an algorithm for restarting semiurgent and elective procedures once there is de-escalation of isolation measures (Fig. 1 ).",

Serological tests with antibody testing may be the solution, where tests can be offered for all individuals. However, current first-generation ELISA tests for COVID IgM and IgG are still in the stages of evolution and require validation in our setting. 4 The caveat is also that patients may not get detected in the early stages of the disease, leading to increased infections in the hospital. The American Enterprise Institute has provided a roadmap to reopening after the coronavirus pandemic. 5 India is likely to go from phase 1 to phase 2 after lockdown measures are relaxed. Despite our slogan being \"Go Corona Go,\" I guess the virus is here to stay. What remains crucial is to build our disease surveillance, testing, and treatment capacity to smoothen the transition. To conclude, we may still not be ready for primetime with PCR testing for all patients, largely because we may not need it in the first place at the moment.",

            "text": "A recent study published from Duval County in Florida by Corral et al 2 tried to analyze the economic and health effects of interventions, namely, endoscopies for urgent indications alone with testing done before and not awaiting results versus testing before semi-urgent procedure versus testing all patients and performing semiurgent and elective endoscopies.They had been doing only 12.8% of the endoscopy volume done before COVID. On the other hand, by using testing in patients with semiurgent indications, they would have been able to do 19% of procedures with an additional cost of 22 U.S. dollars (USD) for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing per patient. On the other hand, the third strategy of testing all patients would help increase the case load back to 95%, but with an additional cost of 105 USD per patient for PCR testing. The model they designed tried to factor, based on prevalence of disease in the community, what the costs would be, also accounting for standard endoscopy costs across the United States. Considering the low prevalence of disease, with low rates of false negatives, rates of healthcare professionals infected per week would be low (<1), provided breach of personal protective equipment (PPE) does not occur. The weekly costs incurred according to each strategy would be 6, 13, and 64 million USD, respectively. The net gain for providers factoring endoscopy costs would be 75, 165, and 767 million USD, respectively. The authors concluded that testing before endoscopy remains a reasonable strategy for prevention over a 3-month period, considering the rate of infection, helping generate significant revenue despite money spent on testing.",
