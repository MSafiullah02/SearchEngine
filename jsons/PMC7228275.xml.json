The mono RT\u2010qPCR\n4\n has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of respiratory virus, but only detects one virus per tube. The multiplex reverse transcription PCR\n1\n enables the detection of virus coinfection but is labor\u2010intensive and susceptible to cross\u2010contamination as it requires post PCR analysis. The mRT\u2010qPCR\n5\n has the advantages of high throughput detection and labor\u2010saving, however, the sensitivity is not yet adequate for assessing clinical specimens with a low viral load.",
