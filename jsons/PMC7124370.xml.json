            "text": "An infectious disease (ID), also known as a communicable or transmissible disease, is defined as an illness caused by infectious pathogens such as bacteria, virus, fungus, parasite, and prion [1]. There are more than 1400 organisms that cause infection in humans [2], [3], [4], [5], and IDs remain as one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality and pose a significant threat to global health and safety [6], [7]. In 2009, communicable diseases accounted for 51% of years of life lost (YLL), a measure of premature mortality (Fig. 1\n) [8]. Interestingly, this number is represented asymmetrically among countries of different income groups. IDs have been reported to be more problematic in low-income countries, where communicable diseases accounted for 68% of YLL compared to only 8% in high-income countries (Fig. 1). However, IDs also cannot be overlooked in the developed world due to the rapid evolution of antimicrobial resistance that render antibiotics less effective against these infections [9], [10].",

Such threats of infectious diseases on a global scale was experienced with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003 [14], H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 [15], Ebola epidemic in 2014 [16], and Zika outbreak in 2015 [17].",

The National Nanotechnology Initiative of the United States defined nanotechnology as the \u201cunderstanding and control of matter at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nm\u201d [18]. At this scale, nanomaterials have tunable optical, magnetic, electrical, thermal and biological properties, and can be engineered with different shapes, sizes, chemical compositions and surface functionalities [19]. These properties enable them to be exploited for improving the detection of biological molecules or whole pathogens. Additionally, nanomaterials have much greater surface-area-to-volume ratios than macroscopic materials [20], which provides a great capacity to functionalize the surface with many molecules. For example, a cube with 1-cm dimensions can be divided into 1021 1-nm cubes, which will increase the surface area by 10 million times [19]. This enables the surface of nanomaterials to be coated with molecules that can selectively bind to the target molecules or pathogens. The applications of nanotechnology for diagnostics is referred to as \u201cnanodiagnostics\u201d.",

This involves direct examination of either stained or unstained smears (blood, sputum, urine, etc.) at the cellular level using a variety of microscopic techniques (e.g. bright field, dark field, and fluorescence microscopy). Such techniques have been reported to achieve high level of diagnostic sensitivity for certain pathogens [26], [28]; however, their outcomes can strongly vary depending on the training level of a microscopist, concentration of the pathogen within the clinical specimen, staining methods, and other sample preparation steps [27], [31]. Hence, manual microscopy may not be a reliable screening method especially when it is performed by non-experts due to its inherent variability [33]. Microscopes can also be expensive with specialized optical features, which make them mostly unavailable in resource-limited and decentralized regions.",

Some microorganisms can be cultured in artificial media (e.g. bacteria, yeast and fungi) while others (e.g. viruses) require living host such as mammalian cells or living animals for culturing and isolation. Selective culture media that contains specific inhibitors can be used to allow growth of specific bacterial pathogens while inhibiting growth of other flora. Culturing can provide quantitative results by spreading a specific volume of specimen over the surface of agar media and calculating the number of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml). This is a commonly-used method for the identification of bacterial pathogens associated with a variety of infections.",

These phenotypic assays include broth dilution and agar diffusion (e.g. antimicrobial gradient diffusion and disc diffusion) methods [36], [37], [38]. Broth dilution can be carried out in either macro- (test tubes) or micro-scale (96-well plate), which involves determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic in a liquid growth medium inoculated with a bacterial suspension by observing the difference in the solution turbidity after incubation. In the agar diffusion method, a bacterial inoculum is applied on an agar plate, and either a paper antibiotic disc, or a plastic test strip that is embedded with an antibiotic concentration gradient placed on the agar surface. The diameter of inhibition zone qualitatively indicates the susceptibility (i.e. either susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) in the disc diffusion method, whereas the MIC is quantitatively measured from the strip in the antimicrobial gradient method for determination of resistance.",

All of these immunoassays involve the use of an enzyme-labeled antibody and a chromogenic substrate of the enzyme that changes the colorimetric or fluorescence signal in the presence of biological molecules (proteins, peptides, etc.) [40]. In a typical sandwich ELISA test, the target analyte is sandwiched between a capture antibody immobilized on a solid surface, and an enzyme-linked detection antibody, which converts the substrate to produce a visible color change or a fluorescence signal [41]. The analytical sensitivity of ELISA is in the femto to nano-molar range, which may not be sufficient for diagnosis of certain diseases [42], [43]. Also, there are difficulties for practical use of this technique in resource-limited settings since ELISA requires a bulky instrument for the optical detection, expensive antibody reagents, many steps of pipetting, and long hours of incubation [42], [43]. ELISA is also susceptible to non-specific binding of the antigen or antibody to the surface of a plate, which can lead to false-positive results and low diagnostic specificity. Moreover, the synthesis of antibodies may be be challenging for some pathogens [40].",

In LFA, the analyte travels along a polymeric strip with reporter probes by capillary force and encounters a detection zone, where the capture probes are immobilized. Binding of analyte-reporter complex to capture probes in the detection zone produces a visible line on the pad [48]. There are several variants of LFA to detect either proteomic or genomic biomarkers. The exclusive use of antibodies as recognition molecules is known as a lateral flow immunoassay, whereas the hybridization of nucleic acids with immobilized complementary strands is called nucleic acid LFA [48]. LFAs do not require washing steps, and can be performed in one-step, which significantly reduce the amount of sample handling. However, LFA has micromolar (\u03bcM) analytical sensitivity, and provides only qualitative or semi-quantitative results precluding its use for diagnosis of pathogens that are presented at low concentrations.",

There are mainly two microfluidic PCR chip designs, which are the stationary reaction chamber and continuous flow systems. In the stationary reaction chamber system, the PCR mixture is kept stationary while the heating unit positioned underneath alternates its temperature. On the other hand, the continuous flow system contains pre-fixed temperature zones, where the PCR mixture flows. Although researchers have successfully miniaturized PCR systems using a microfluidic approach, it still requires complex and bulky peripherals. For instance, large gas tanks or syringe pumps are often used as the pressure source for fluid actuation, and bulky microscopes or electrical instruments are required for signal readout [58].",

This extraction step is further complicated for RNA samples, since RNA degrading enzymes, RNases, are present in most bodily fluids and cause rapid degradation of extracted RNA unless careful extraction protocol is followed.

            "text": "QDs are semiconducting nanocrystals and composed of atoms from groups II-VI, IV-VI or III-V in the periodic table [62]. These nanomaterials exhibit quantum confinement effects, which lead to size-dependent electrical and optical properties [63]. In a bulk-scale semiconductor, the energy states are grouped into energy bands, where an electron from the valence band (i.e. highest occupied electronic state) gets excited to the conduction band (i.e. lowest unoccupied electronic state) upon the absorption of a photon, leaving a vacancy in the valence band (i.e. hole). The excited electron and remaining hole are attracted to each other by the electrostatic force, and this electron-hole pair is referred to as an exciton. As the size of a semiconducting material becomes near or smaller than the exciton Bohr radius (typically less than 100 nm), which is the case for QDs, the energy bands become discrete energy levels with potential barriers that confine the electron motion (Fig. 2\nA). This quantum confinement effect forms the basis of size-tunable properties of QDs. As the size of a QD increases, the discrete energy levels split and results in a narrower bandgap, which corresponds to the emission of a longer wavelength photon upon the recombination of an electron-hole pair (Fig. 2A). This allows the fluorescence emission of a QD to be tuned by manipulating their size to produce a variety of emission wavelengths (Fig. 2B).",

This optical property becomes useful for diagnostic applications because QDs of different emission profiles can all be excited using a single light source given that the energy of excitation is greater than the largest bandgap energy among QDs of different sizes. For instance, a light source with its wavelength in the ultraviolet (UV) range can excite all Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) QDs that emit fluorescence in the visible range as opposed to organic dyes that typically require multiple excitation sources for different emission profiles. Also, QDs have narrower emission spectra, better photostability and are brighter than organic dyes. For example, the emission spectrum of a QD is symmetric and can have a full width at half maximum (FWHM) as low as 12 nm [67], whereas an organic fluorophore is often characterized with an asymmetric emission spectrum tailing to the longer wavelength with its FWHM between 50 and 100 nm [68]. Such optical properties of QDs become useful for many bio-labeling and in vitro diagnostic applications [64], [65], [66].",

            "text": "GNPs are metallic nanostructures that have been used as early as in the 4th century BC for glass staining and making of the Lycurgus Cup by Romans [69]. GNPs display surface plasmon resonance effect, which contributes to their unique optical and thermal properties. When GNPs are irradiated by light, the oscillation of electric field causes synchronized oscillation of conduction band electrons, also known as the plasmons, as illustrated in Fig. 3\nA [70]. The displacement of conduction band electrons then creates a net charge difference or a dipole on the surface. Such induced dipole that oscillates in-phase with the electric field of the incident light causes a strong absorption of light at specific wavelengths [71]. For sub-50 nm spherical GNPs, light gets absorbed near the wavelengths of blue and green colors, and transmitted with the wavelength of a red color (Fig. 3B). A solution of small spherical GNPs therefore appears as a red color. The oscillation frequency or the absorption wavelength depends on the electron density, the effective mass of the electron, and the charge distribution, which can all be influenced by the size, shape and surface chemistry of the particles [70]. As the size of GNPs increases, the absorption peak becomes shifted to a longer wavelength, and the solution becomes a dark purple color (Fig. 3B). As opposed to spherical GNPs that have a single absorption peak, gold nanorods have two absorption peaks: one in the visible range that corresponds to the transverse plasmon, and another in the near infrared range, which corresponds to the longitudinal plasmon [20], [72] (Fig. 3C). The inter-particle spacing also affects the absorption profile of GNPs. When the inter-particle distance becomes smaller than the diameter of GNPs, the solution color changes from red to purple or blue depending on the extent of aggregation due to the coupling of surface plasmons that shifts the absorbance peak to a longer wavelength (Fig. 3D) [73].",

Out of these, iron oxide nanoparticles are the most extensively explored MNPs in biomedicine due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and superparamagnetic properties [19], [75]. In the macroscale, electrons of the magnetic particles can either spin in the opposite or same directions, in which the opposing spins cancel each other out, and weaken the localized magnetic field. On the other hand, magnetic particles at the nanoscale have more constrained electrons that only spin in the same direction, which strengthen the localized magnetic field [19]. For example, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) that are smaller than 20 nm have a single domain of electrons that spin in the same direction, whereas iron oxide macroparticles that are greater than 20 nm have multiple domains of electrons with opposite spins (Fig. 4\n) [19]. Hence, SPIONs reveal much greater magnetic susceptibility to external magnetic field when compared to paramagnetic materials. Unlike ferromagnetic materials that remain magnetized permanently, SPIONs can get demagnetized with the removal of the external magnetic field. For these reasons, there are some Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved MNPs that are currently being used as contrast agents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) [76], and many companies sell MNPs for isolation of cells or extraction of biological molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.",

In one study, Park et al. adopted a typical sandwich immuno-assay with the addition of surface-engineered QDs, which were used as signal amplifiable reporter labels. The self-assembly of QDs was designed using streptavidin-biotin conjugate pair and zwitterionic surface modification. In this system, myoglobin first binds to immobilized capture antibody, followed by binding of myoglobin detection antibody and biotinylated secondary detection antibody. This is then followed by the binding of streptavidin conjugated QDs, which will then bind to biotin conjugated QDs in a layer-by-layer approach (Fig. 5B). This system demonstrated detection of myoglobin with sub-attomolar limit of detection (LOD) [80]. QDs have also been used in the context of engineering F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) based detection systems [81], [82], [83], and multiplexed diagnostics [84], [85], [86]. FRET based assays utilize QDs as energy donors, which transfer the energy to acceptor fluorophores or quenchers for detection of small molecules and nucleic acids. This allowed for the sensitive detection of DNA (10 pM\u20131 nM LOD, [87], [88]) and small molecules (1 nM\u20131 \u03bcM LOD, [89], [90]).",

            "text": "The multiplexing capability of QDs can be illustrated by the development of barcodes. Different combinations of QDs can be infused into polymeric microbeads to generate fluorescent barcodes (Fig. 5C). The surface of the QD encoded microbeads can be functionalized with DNA capture probes, which hybridize with the target DNA labeled with a fluorescent dye, yielding both the barcode and detection signals [84]. In this complex, the barcode signal can be used to determine the identity of a target DNA (e.g. the type of an infectious disease, genotype or subtype of a disease, antibiotic resistance, etc.), and the detection signal can be used to determine the presence or the absence of a target DNA (i.e. whether a patient is infected or not). These QD barcodes can be designed with different colors (m) and intensity levels (n) to generate (n\nm-1) barcode signals [84]. For instance, combinations of 6 QD colors with 10 intensity levels can theoretically create one million barcodes [84]. Although the actual multiplexing capacity would be much lower due to the requirement of signal-to-noise ratio, spectral overlaps, and variations in the fluorescence intensity [84], QD barcodes opened up a new opportunity to further improve multiplexed diagnosis and high-throughput screening of infectious diseases. Previously, a library of over 100 barcode signals was generated with 2 QD colors from a set of 5, at 2 intensity ratios via concentration-controlled flow-focusing (CCFF) method, which demonstrated a highly robust way of synthesizing optically encoded microbeads that are stable at a wide range of biological environments (e.g. temperature, pH, and buffer conditions) with good monodispersity [91] (Fig. 5C).",

Studies have also shown multiplexed detection of several genomic and proteomic biomarkers for infectious diseases such as HIV, HBV, HCV, malaria, and syphilis using QD barcodes in a sandwich assay format with pM sensitivity [85], [86]. Moreover, coating the surface of QD barcodes with metal nanoshells was shown to improve the analytical sensitivity of the assay by 2-orders of magnitude due to the metal-enhanced fluorescence effect, and achieve better bead stability, fluorescence consistency and loading capacity of recognition molecules [93]. More recently, QD barcode assay was clinically validated to achieve high clinical sensitivity (\u223c90%) and specificity (\u223c95%) by detecting multiple regions of HBV genome [94]. Such multiplexing capability of QD barcodes is useful in the development of diagnostics because it can reduce labor cost and time involved in the detection of multiple biomarkers.",

This quenching can act over long distances (as large as 75 nm [97]), and depends on particle shape [98], [99] and size [95], [100]. Therefore, GNPs have been adapted for FRET assays, in which the energy state associated with the excited electron is non-radiatively transferred from the fluorophore to the nanoparticle. This assay format demonstrated improved detection sensitivity [101], better selectivity to single base mismatches [102] and simultaneous quenching of multiple dyes [103]. In addition, GNP-QD molecular systems have been reported where QDs are efficiently quenched by the GNPs. These constructs have been used to quantify viral titer in living cells down to 0.1 PFU/mL [104] and to detect influenza antigen (hemagglutinin) with \u223c100 pM sensitivity [105]. Similarly to GNPs, graphene oxide can also quench fluorophores or QDs attached to its surface [106], [107], [108], [109]. As illustrated in Fig. 5D, graphene oxide can bind to dye-labeled single-stranded DNA probes and quench fluorescent signals in the absence of target DNA, whereas the formation of a duplex with its target releases the DNA from graphene oxide and recovers fluorescence signal.",

SPR effect of plasmonic nanoparticles has been used to greatly enhance the signal from Raman spectroscopy. For instance, GNPs coated with Ramen reporter molecules have been used for detection of surface envelope and capsid antigens of West Nile and Rift Valley fever viruses (Fig. 6\nA). The presence of the antigen links MNPs with GNP reporter probes, which become magnetically separated, and GNPs enhance SERS signal emitted from Raman reporter molecules. DNA detection has been also demonstrated, which involved hybridization between TAMRA (TMR) labeled target DNA and capture probe functionalized GNPs (Fig. 6B). This hybridization brings TMR in close proximity with GNP, and enhanced TMR Raman signature. Similarly, Raman dye labeled oligonucleotide probes have been conjugated to GNPs in a scanometric assay to generate spectroscopic codes for individual target DNA and demonstrate a multiplexed detection (Fig. 6C). In this system, the presence of target DNA connects GNP probes with capture DNA attached on a planar surface. Silver staining of GNPs determines the presence of the target, and the identity of the target is revealed by SERS signals.",

The signal can be significantly enhanced (as much as 1011 times [114]) when the molecule is positioned close to the surface of plasmonic nanoparticle, or in a \u201chot spot\u201d created by the intersection of SPR fields of two or more nanoparticles, allowing for highly sensitive single-molecule detection [115].

Furthermore, the distance of the SERS probe to the \u201chot spot\u201d is critical, with the signal enhancement dropping by orders of magnitude even at a separation of a few nanometers. This generally results in variability of enhancement between different probes, which complicates analyte quantification [113]. Due to these considerations, most applications are based on less sensitive bulk rather than single-molecule nanoparticle systems, where SERS is achieved due to probe immobilization on metal nanoparticles in the solution phase. This technique has been successfully applied for detection of nucleic acids (10 pM\u2013100 nM LOD) [116], [117], proteins (100 pM LOD) [118], cancer cells [119], bacteria (250 cells/mL LOD) [120], [121] and viruses (100 PFU/mL LOD) [122], [123], and for tracking small molecule drugs inside living cells (100 pM LOD) [124]. One major drawback of this technique is that the probe must be positioned close to the nanoparticle surface, which limits the choice of nanoparticle surface chemistry. Another limitation is that SERS requires high power lasers for excitation and expensive equipment for readout. This complicates the translation of this technique to POC applications.",

This design combines MNPs with gold reporter nanoparticles, both functionalized on their surface with a ligand (which can be DNA or antibody) designed to recognize and bind to the analytical target. Binding of analyte crosslinks the two particles, allowing the GNPs to be magnetically separated together with the MNPs. Barcode DNA is then released from GNPs, and detected via scanometric assay. In the scanometric assay, barcode DNA connects GNPs with capture probes that are attached on a planar substrate, followed by silver staining of bound GNPs. This system contains two levels of signal amplification. The release of barcode DNA from GNPs initiates the first amplification, and the subsequent silver staining of GNPs gives rise to the second amplification. Thus, application of this assay has produced ultrasensitive detection of proteins (500 aM [127]), and DNA (500 zM [126]), where detection limit of DNA is comparable to that achieved with quantitative PCR. However, this assay is complex, requires multiple steps, and takes approximately 6 hours to complete.",

            "text": "EC assays are another group of biosensors that have been developed over the last 50 years. These sensors are based on the premise that interaction with the chemical analyte changes one of the electrical properties of the system: current, potential, or impedance, which can be recorded by an electronic device. Two main sensing schemes are (i) biocatalytic and (ii) affinity biosensors [136]. In the biocatalytic scheme, enzyme whose substrate is the target analyte is immobilized on the electrode\u2019s surface. Upon analyte binding, the enzyme either produces electrically active chemical species, or directly transfers electrons to the electrode. High catalytic activity of enzymes results in high sensitivity (fM, [137]) and specificity of substrate binding allows the detection to be performed in complex mixtures without sample pre-processing. However, a major limitation is that enzymes are only available for a limited number of substrates. Affinity-based detection is an alternative EC technique in which electrodes are coated either with antibodies or DNA probes designed to recognize target protein or small molecule antigen, or to hybridize to the complementary DNA. Binding of the target to these probes modulates the electronic properties of the surface, and results in changes in the recorded signal. Since antibodies for a large number of antigens are available and DNA probes can be designed for any sequence, this technique has been extended to much larger number of analytes. However, a lack of amplification step limits the sensitivity of EC affinity biosensors.",

In one study, nanowire field effect transistors have been modified with different antibody receptors for detection of single virus particles (Fig. 8\nA). Binding of a single virus to one of the nanowires changed the conductance, which is a characteristic of the viral surface charge that is only unique to that nanowire. The conductance was returned to the baseline value once the virus unbinds from the nanowire. Scanometric assay has also been used in an EC biosensor (Fig. 8B). In this system, capture probes are immobilized in the gap between two electrodes, followed by the sandwich hybridization of capture, target and GNP DNA probes. Catalytic reduction of the silver allows current to flow between two electrodes, whereas in the absence of the target DNA, there is no current flow.",

Another approach uses nanoparticles to label surface-bound analytes in a sandwich-like format, which increases the sensitivity of detection by enhancing the strength of impedance modulation. This assay format was used to detect nucleic acids (fM LOD [146], [147]), and proteins (fM LOD [148]).

The most widely reported format, which is based on aggregation of GNPs, was developed by Mirkin and coworkers [151], [152]. Due to the SPR effect, GNPs show strong absorbance in visible wavelengths. For 13 nm GNPs, which are generally used for these assays, the absorption wavelength is 520 nm, making the solution of these nanoparticles appear brightly red. However, if nanoparticles are brought together in close proximity (i.e. when inter-particle spacing becomes smaller than diameter of GNPs), their SPR fields couple and resonance peak shifts to longer wavelengths, which results in red-to-blue color transition that is easily visible by a naked eye. Several implementations have been reported where binding of the analyte causes either aggregation or dispersion of GNPs for colorimetric detection of IDs (Fig. 9\nA).",

In the two probes strategy, two sets of GNPs are prepared with different probes.

In this system, aptamers that are specifically designed to bind target bacteria are initially adsorbed on to the surface of GNPs, and prevented salt-induced aggregation due to electrostatic repulsion.

Integrating plasmon coupling of GNPs with DNAzyme was studied to provide a linear amplification step and improve the sensitivity level in the detection of dengue virus nucleic acid. This system consists of DNAzyme attached to the surface of 15 nm GNPs, where DNAzyme gets triggered by the addition of magnesium ions for cleavage of viral RNA, and cleaved RNA induce aggregation of GNPs in the presence of salt and heat [162]. Another example includes the integration of the plasmon coupling of GNPs with multicomponent nucleic acid enzyme (MNAzyme) [163], [164] (Fig. 9C). This system consists of a set of GNPs aggregated by intact linker DNA, and MNAzyme components that are activated in the presence of target DNA to cleave the linker DNA, re-distributing GNPs to a monodispersed state. The switch of GNPs from aggregated to monodispersed state shifts the absorbance peak to a shorter wavelength, and correspondingly alters the solution color from dark purple to red. Hence, MNAzyme-GNP assay can provide a simple and fast colorimetric detection of genetic targets for POC diagnosis of infectious pathogens; however, there is still a need for an additional signal amplification strategy to detect pathogens that are presented at low concentrations.",

Recent studies have started to exploit the thermal properties of metal nanoparticles for diagnosis of infectious diseases. Many types of nanoparticles can generate heat upon optical or electrical excitation. For example, both gold nanoshells and carbon nanotubes can produce thermal emission upon excitation in the near-infrared wavelength. The electrons of these excited nanoparticles interact with localized water molecules to induce vibration and dissipate heat when they transition to the ground state [169]. Nanoparticles that are poor fluorophores (i.e. low quantum yield) can generate a significant amount of thermal energy or heat. Recently, Bischof and co-workers demonstrated the use of thermal imaging to detect gold nanoparticles in lateral flow immunoassays (Fig. 10\nA and B) [170], [171]. In this system, antibody-labeled GNPs were used as a contrast agent in conjunction with a thermal contrast amplification reader. The thermal contrast amplification reader matched the laser wavelength to the GNP plasmon resonance peak, and detected temperature rise using an infrared detector, allowing quantification of GNP signals.",

Colorimetric nanodiagnostic modality was able to demonstrate improvement in the analytical sensitivity (\u03bcM-pM) in comparison to LFA technique (\u03bcM), but still needs improvement to meet the analytical sensitivity of ELISA (nM-fM) for protein detection. However, other nanodiagnostic modalities (i.e. fluorescence, SERS, magnetic, electrochemical and thermal) demonstrated better and similar analytical sensitivities than LFA and ELISA respectively. For detection of nucleic acids, none of the nanodiagnostic approaches were as sensitive as PCR (zM), except for the Mirkin\u2019s bio-barcode assay that utilized magnetic separation, and two levels of signal amplification.

The development of nanodiagnostics can be categorized into four stages as illustrated in Fig. 12\nA. The first stage was heavily focused on material characterization, where the researchers explored different methods to synthesize and purify nanomaterials, obtain good monodispersity and colloidal stability, and functionalize surface with various chemistries. This led to the pre-clinical development stage, which has been the main research work over the last decades. This stage involved determining analytical characteristics such as LODs and linear dynamic ranges using synthetic targets. The field is now moving beyond this demonstration phase and starting to focus on clinical validation of the diagnostic devices. During this transition phase, additional metrics that describe the accuracy of a diagnostic test will be used to evaluate the diagnostic technology. In evaluating the clinical performance of a diagnostic device, metrics such as clinical sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), and diagnostic odds ratio, will be required (Table 2\n) [172]. The successful completion of clinical validation will confirm the intended diagnostic application of a system, such as screening, sub-typing, monitoring, quantifying or profiling drug resistance (Fig. 12B).",

Field testing of nanodiagnostics has been limited primarily due to the lack of an all-in-one device that can automate complex diagnostic procedures. Many nanodiagnostic systems involve extensive pipetting and laboratory work for extraction, amplification and detection of disease biomarkers, which significantly hamper their usage in the remote regions. This challenge needs to be addressed in the future by minimizing user interventions in the diagnostic procedure and replacing the bulky readout systems with a portable device. Chan\u2019s group proposed such system in 2015, which contains different compartments that are connected by capillary tubes for extraction, amplification, and detection of nucleic acids. The flow of reagents between compartments were proposed to be electrically driven, and this device will attach to a smartphone for measurement of final assay signals [173]. Another system was developed by Sia\u2019s group, who built a smartphone accessory that can run ELISA in a microfluidic format, and report the optical density of silver stained GNPs using a smartphone device [174]. Instead of using power-consuming electrical pump, this \u201cdongle\u201d utilized a rubber bulb that can be pressed to mechanically activate a negative pressure chamber and drive the flow of reagents that are stored in a microfluidic cassette. Other components in the dongle included light emitting diodes, photodetectors microcontroller, and an audio jack connector that can transmit data to the smartphone via frequency shift keying [174].",

Alternatively, these terms can be replaced with other clinical metrics that are used to characterize diagnostic accuracy and clinical effectiveness such as the area under the curve (AUC) of a ROC plot, rate of antibiotic misuse, and time to treatment initiation. This metric can therefore be used to describe the overall diagnostic performance by capturing the aspect of patient outcome from the implementation of a new diagnostic test in the field, and accounting for test inaccuracies, delays and clinical consequences as a result of missing or delaying diagnosis [176].",
