Such an inflammatory response begins with the detection of the potential life-threatening event by recognizing so-called danger signals. These signal molecules have been classically divided into: i) Exogenous, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [1], which are conserved motifs on pathogens that are not found in higher eukaryocytes; and ii) endogenous innate danger molecules, also named damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or alarmins, which are structurally diverse proteins rapidly released by the host itself during infection or (sterile) tissue damage [2].",

DAMPs can be secreted either actively or passively following necrosis but are not released by apoptotic cells [4] and have activating effects on receptor-expressing cells engaged in host defense. DAMPs can also be detected by TLRs and NLRs and their engagement induces NF-\u03baB activation as well, suggesting that DAMPs and PAMPs use, at least partially, the same receptors and signaling pathways. Liu et al. [5] however, propose that the immune system treats DAMPs and PAMPs differently; they suggest that DAMPs - but not PAMPs - bring CD24-Siglec G/10 into the proximity of TLRs/NLRs, resulting in repressed DAMP-induced TLR/NLR signaling.",

            "text": "When invaded by pathogens, host defense systems encounter PAMPs from microorganisms and DAMPs that are released from tissues, which are recognized by TLRs and NLRs to warn the host of imminent danger. In addition, the multiligand receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is regarded as a prototypic DAMP receptor that can bind several DAMPs, including HMGB1 and S100A12 [6]. Other known RAGE ligands include amyloid, \u03b2-sheet fibrils, S100B and S100P [7]; furthermore, \u03b22 integrins can interact with RAGE [8]. RAGE is expressed at high levels in the lungs and at low levels in normal adult tissues, including on cells involved in the innate immune system, e.g., neutrophils, T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells [7]. Engagement of RAGE by its ligands leads to receptor-dependent signaling and activation of NF-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways [7]. Activation of RAGE plays a role in diverse experimentally-induced sterile inflammatory and infectious diseases, including cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced abdominal sepsis [9], diabetic nephropathy, delayed type hypersensitivity, type II collagen induced arthritis, hepatic injury, and diabetic atherosclerosis [7,10-12]. This review focuses on new insights into the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, including sepsis, peritonitis and pneumonia, offered by studies conducted in the RAGE research field.",

The V domain in the extracellular part of RAGE is essential for binding of its ligands. Because of its ability to recognize three-dimensional structures rather than specific amino acid sequences, RAGE can interact with a wide range of ligands. RAGE was first identified as a receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), explaining its name. AGEs are products of the non-enzymatic glycation and oxidation of lipids, proteins and other macromolecules that appear, in particular, under conditions of increased availability of reducing sugars and/or enhanced oxidative stress, especially when molecules turn over slowly and aldose levels are elevated. Further investigations showed that RAGE can recognize a diverse array of endogenous molecules that warn the immune system and induce a defensive immune response; the alarmins or DAMPs.",

            "text": "HMGB1 is a non-histone DNA-binding protein that serves as a structural component to facilitate the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes in the nucleus [14]. Extra-cellularly, HMGB1 functions as a cytokine. In response to inflammatory stimuli, including PAMPs, HMGB1 can be actively released into the extracellular environment from a variety of cells including monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, enterocytes, pituicytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells [14]. HMGB1 can also be passively secreted into the extracellular milieu when cells die in a non-programmed way (necrosis), whereas apoptotic cells modify their chromatin so that HMGB1 binds irreversibly and consequently is not released [4]. During infectious diseases, increased HMGB1 concentrations may be due to active as well as passive release. Detection methods of HMGB1 that are currently used (and published) do not distinguish between these (and possible other) different forms of HMGB1. More studies are necessary to: 1) Report the biological activity of (different forms of) HMGB1; and 2) develop HMGB1 ELISA assays that can distinguish between these (possibly also functionally) different forms of HMGB1. Most investigations on HMGB1 and infection involve sepsis, the second leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units (ICUs) and the 10th leading cause of death overall. Patients with severe sepsis display elevated circulating HMGB1 levels [15-17] and HMGB1 is predominantly released at the site of infection; patients with pneumonia and those with peritonitis showed increased concentrations in fluid obtained from the bronchoalveolar space and abdomen, respectively [17]. In an animal model of CLP-induced sepsis, the kinetics of HMGB1 secretion in vivo was delayed and more sustained when compared with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 [18,19]. Similarly, various interventions that inhibit HMGB1 activity or production, such as anti-HMGB1 antibodies, the A-box segment of HMGB1, ethyl pyruvate, and nicotine, reduced CLP-induced sepsis and/or LPS lethality even if treatment was delayed for many hours, up to one day after the challenge [20,21]. An implicated crucial event in sepsis patho-physiology is apoptosis of immune cells, playing a major role in immunosuppression and lethality [22]. HMGB1 seems to be a downstream factor of apoptosis in the final common pathway to organ damage in severe sepsis as indicated by observations that prevention of lymphocyte apoptosis improved survival after CLP [23], whereas anti-HMGB1 treatment reduced lethality in the same model without influencing apoptosis [19]. This indicates that HMGB1 secretion is a relatively late event in sepsis that contributes significantly to a worsened outcome. In addition, it has been reported that very pure HMGB1 does not have cytokine-inducing capacity itself, but activates cells indirectly by first acquiring immune stimulating CpG DNA [24], which is released in the blood-stream during bacterial sepsis. However, a recent study reported that HMGB1-mediated induction of macro-phage cytokine production requires binding to TLR4, and that binding and signaling are dependent on a molecular mechanism that requires cysteine in position 106 within the B box [25]. Together these data indicate that HMGB1 may exert pro-inflammatory effects in a direct TLR4-dependent way and an indirect way via binding of DAMPs and other agonistic molecules.",

RAGE plays a role in the regulation of cell migration in several ways. First of all, RAGE is a counter-receptor for integrins on leukocytes; in particular, RAGE has been identified as a binding partner for the \u03b22 integrins, Mac-1 and p150, 95 [8]. Second, by the interaction of RAGE with \u03b22 integrin-mediated leukocyte recruitment in vivo: RAGE-/- mice displayed a diminished number of adherent inflammatory cells on the peritoneum after CLP [9] and a reduction in neutrophil influx in the peritoneal cavity after thioglycollate peritonitis [8]. Interestingly, HMGB1 can activate lateral (in cis) RAGE-Mac-1 interactions on the leukocyte cell surface, enhancing Mac-1-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1-dependent adhesion and migration [27] (Figure 1, indicated by the blue line and blue \"+\"). Furthermore, a recent report shows that endothelial expressed RAGE acts in concert with ICAM-1 in mediating \u03b22 integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion during acute trauma-induced inflammation [28] (Figure 1, indicated by the green line and green \"+\").",

The predicted cytosolic portion of RAGE, consisting of 43 amino acids, is short compared to other PRRs, the TLRs and IL-1 receptors, and does not include a known signaling domain or motif. A RAGE mutant lacking this intracellular tail does not activate NF-\u03baB and behaves like a dominant negative, preventing pro-inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages. These data indicate a critical role of this cytosolic portion in transducing the signal from the cell surface to the nucleus. One possibility is that RAGE uses as yet unknown adaptors framing a whole 'new' signaling cascade to NF-\u03baB. Another possibility is that the RAGE tail interacts with a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)-containing protein which then recruits the downstream TIR-containing proteins in a way analogous to TLR-mediated signaling pathways. Finally, RAGE could transduce signals from the cell surface to the nucleus by bypassing the TIR-containing adaptor, directly interacting with member(s) of the signaling cascade.",

Exogenous sRAGE treatment indeed attenuated inflammatory responses in several animal models, including models of type II collagen-induced arthritis, hepatic injury, diabetic atherosclerosis, delayed type hypersensitivity, and experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis [7].

            "text": "Recent studies point to an important role of RAGE in the pulmonary compartment in physiological as well as in pathological circumstances. Physiologically, RAGE is expressed at high basal levels in the lungs relative to other tissues [26,29-34], suggesting that RAGE may have lung-specific functions distinct from the role of RAGE in other adult tissues. In particular, although the kidney is dramatically affected by microangiopathy and fibrosis - which is substantially attributed to RAGE - in patients with diabetes, the lungs, with a significantly higher baseline RAGE expression than the kidney, remain unaffected. In addition, RAGE has been found to be specifically localized near the basal cell membrane within alveolar pneumocytes [32,35,36]. These two observations raise the question as to whether RAGE has a function in normal healthy lungs. Indeed, Englert et al. documented that aged RAGE-/- mice develop pulmonary fibrosis-like alterations spontaneously; lungs from 19 to 24 month-old RAGE-/- mice showed increased collagen staining and displayed increased levels of hydroxyproline relative to wild type mice [31]. RAGE knockdown in pulmonary fibroblasts increased their proliferation and migration in vitro, suggesting an important protective function of RAGE in the lungs and that loss of RAGE may be related to functional changes of pulmonary cell types resulting in fibrotic disease [34]. Another study demonstrated that RAGE on epithelial cells promoted their adherence to human collagen (a major component of the alveolar basal lamina) and a spreading morphology, which may facilitate gas exchange and alveolar stability in vivo [34,35]. Together, these data suggest that RAGE plays a role in maintaining lung homeostasis in normal, healthy lungs. Further studies are needed to unravel the function(s) of pulmonary RAGE in physiology in more detail.",

In contrast, Englert et al. showed that RAGE-/- mice developed more severe lung fibrosis after asbestos administration as measured by histological scoring and total lung hydroxyproline quantification [31]. Of note, in all these studies, the mice were much younger at the time of sacrifice than the aged (19-24 month-old) RAGE-/- mice that developed pulmonary fibrosis spontaneously in the experiment by Englert et al.

The difference was possibly partially due to an increased killing capacity of RAGE-/- alveolar macrophages. Additionally, lung injury and neutrophil recruitment were reduced in the RAGE-/- mice, which parallels findings on RAGE as an endothelial counter receptor for the \u03b22 integrin, Mac-1, [8] and the interplay between RAGE and Mac-1 on leukocytes, required for HMGB1-mediated inflammatory cell recruitment [27].

We demonstrated that RAGE deficiency resulted in a better outcome from pulmonary influenza A virus infection as indicated by a relative protection from influenza A virus-induced lethality in mice [40]. This was accompanied by improved viral clearance and enhanced cellular T cell response and activation of neutrophils, suggesting that endogenous RAGE impairs the cellular immunity against respiratory tract infection with influenza A virus. RAGE ligand, HMGB1, as well as sRAGE were upregulated in BAL fluid during influenza A virus pneumonia. Hence, similar to pneumonia induced by the Gram-positive bacterium S. pneumoniae, RAGE is detrimental during pneumonia caused by influenza A virus. This is of particular interest, since it has been suggested that the greatest proportion of the mortality associated with influenza A virus infection is due to secondary bacterial pneumonia, with S. pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen of the superinfection. Therefore, RAGE is a potential treatment target in postinfluenza pneumococcal pneumonia and further research is warranted to investigate this.",

Moreover, anti-RAGE antibody yielded a better survival even when the anti-RAGE therapy was delayed up to 24 hours after CLP in mice receiving antibiotics [41]. The protective effect provided by the absence of RAGE was related to a firm inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation, suggesting that the lack of excessive NF-\u03baB activation in RAGE-/- mice might have contributed to their reduced mortality [9]. In addition, RAGE deficiency resulted in fewer inflammatory cells in the peritoneum [9], which parallels the results of an earlier investigation by the same group of authors identifying RAGE as a counter-receptor for the \u03b22 integrin, Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), and thereby as a mediator of leukocyte recruitment and adhesion [8]. Furthermore, the protective effect of RAGE inhibition in this CLP model could at least in part be the consequence of the inhibition of one of its ligands, HMGB1. Indeed, HMGB1 is secreted into the circulation after CLP and anti-HMGB1 antibody led to increased survival after CLP-induced peritonitis [18].",

            "text": "In the same surgically (CLP)-induced model of sepsis, RAGE deficiency and anti-RAGE therapy were reported not to affect bacterial outgrowth in the peritoneum, liver, or spleen [41]. Notwithstanding, a possible role of RAGE in antibacterial defense cannot be easily evaluated from this study because host defense against CLP depends, at least in part, on the extent of intestinal necrosis and the formation of a local abscess. Also, all mice in this experiment received broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial outgrowth was only determined in mice that survived (i.e., not at predefined time points after CLP). For this reason, we used our model of abdominal sepsis induced by injection of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli into the peritoneum [42,43] to study whether RAGE affects antibacterial defense. This model is a relevant tool to investigate the role of receptors/mediators in limiting the growth and dissemination of bacteria after a primary intra-abdominal infection and to assess the contribution of these proteins to specific immune responses. RAGE expression was upregulated during E. coli induced sepsis [42]. RAGE deficiency (either pharmacologically using anti-RAGE IgG anti-bodies or genetically using RAGE knock out mice) was related to a higher bacterial load and dissemination [42]. These data indicate that RAGE signaling contributes to an effective antibacterial response during abdominal sepsis. RAGE exerted this effect probably indirectly and not via direct interaction with E. coli, considering the observation that leukocytes from RAGE-/- mice had an unaltered capacity to phagocytose and kill E. coli in vitro. Furthermore, the finding that deficiency of RAGE in general was associated with an exaggerated host response during E. coli sepsis [42] on the one hand, and with an attenuated inflammatory response and better survival in (other) sterile models of intraperitoneal injection of LPS derived from E. coli [42,44] on the other hand, suggests that although RAGE is involved in the immune reaction to E. coli, this function can be compensated for by other receptors in the presence of a growing bacterial load. The high-affinity RAGE ligand, HMGB1, is secreted into the circulation systemically during clinical sepsis [16-18] as well as in our experimental sepsis model of E. coli [43]. Importantly, HMGB1 has been shown to transduce cellular signals in vitro and in vivo by interacting with at least three other receptors, i.e., TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 when HMGB1 is complexed with CPG DNA [24,44,45]. One possible explanation for the increased response in the RAGE lacking mice during E. coli sepsis is, therefore, that the absence of RAGE could facilitate the interaction between HMGB1 and TLR2, TLR4 and/or TLR9.",

Knowledge on the role of endogenous sRAGE in sepsis is scarce. Hudson et al. demonstrated that sRAGE levels might represent an early marker of microvascular dysfunction, a phenomenon also present in sepsis [50]. Furthermore, increased sRAGE concentrations in sepsis might represent the acute inflammatory status as splice variants of RAGE or as split off variants of the cell surface RAGE, the latter analogous to ICAM-1, another member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is a marker of cellular damage during sepsis. Another possibility is that systemic sRAGE levels might be elevated in parallel with HMGB1/S100A12 levels as a counter-system against HMGB1/S100A12 elicited tissue effects. More research is needed to clarify the functional role of sRAGE in sepsis and its putative role as a new sepsis marker.",

It would be highly interesting to evaluate whether RAGE can directly bind to, become activated, and mount a first immune reaction after ligation with specific PAMPs. Furthermore, RAGE-mediated effects on other first-line defense mechanisms, such as chemo-taxis, killing, phagocytosis and respiratory burst could depend on the pathogen. As such, targeting RAGE may be ineffective or even harmful in some infectious conditions. Therefore, more studies are necessary to justify clinical trials targeting RAGE in patients with severe infections. In this respect one could think of research on RAGE inhibition in pneumococcal and influenza A viral pneumonia. Additionally, experiments in which RAGE targeting is delayed until after bacterial/viral infection and combined with antibiotic/antiviral therapy should be considered. Moreover, more studies need to be conducted on the role of RAGE in critical organ derangements involved in the pathogenesis of severe infection, including activation of the coagulation system and the complement system. RAGE remains a potential yet promising therapeutic target that awaits further research.",

The damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and S100A12, are released during infection ([15,17], and unpublished data) and bind to and activate RAGE. It has to be determined whether other S100 proteins and other DAMPs are RAGE ligands (indicated as purple shapes) released during infection. It would be interesting to investigate whether RAGE can directly bind to, become activated and mount a first immune reaction after ligation with specific PAMPs as well. Engagement of RAGE by its ligands results in receptor-dependent signaling and activation of NF-\u03baB leading to a pro-inflammatory response; the signaling pathway is largely unknown. In addition, RAGE interacts as an endothelial (and epithelial) adhesion receptor with the leukocyte integrin, CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) (lower section) [8]. Furthermore, lateral (in cis) RAGE-Mac-1 interaction on the leukocyte surface is mediated by HMGB1 and activates Mac-1-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 dependent adhesion and migration and augments leukocyte recruitment [27] (indicated by the blue line and blue \"+\"). Moreover, a recent report shows that endothelially expressed RAGE acts in concert with ICAM-1 in mediating \u03b22 integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion during acute trauma-induced inflammation [28] (indicated by the green line and green \"+\").",
