The virus is zoonotic in nature, spreading through human\u2013animal interactions, with the wet seafood markets of Wuhan being considered the breeding grounds of this coronavirus. Initially, the virus was called the Wuhan virus, the bat virus, and 2019-nCoV. On 11 February 2020, after rising in notoriety because of its rapid transmission and dire impact on morbidity and mortality rates, the virus was given the taxonomic nomenclature of \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO); the disease it causes is known as COVID-19 [1]. The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was submitted on 12 January 2020 to the US National Center of Biotechnology\u2019s database with ID NC_045512. It showed that SARS-CoV-2 is a 29,903 bp (base pairs) single-stranded RNA coronavirus, with a close resemblance to SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV [2].",

On 11 March 2020, the WHO categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic [8]. On 27 February 2020, Pakistan reported its first two patients with COVID-19, both of whom had recently returned to Pakistan from Iran [9].",

Notwithstanding this, current trade agreements with China and the politico-religious relationship with Iran has resulted in an influx of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals from these two regional epicenters.

Italy and Iran also had a large surge in transmission and deaths during the first month after the first cases (Fig. 1a). Conversely, the number of cases in the USA increased to just 15 in the first month after they reported their first infection. A comparison of WHO-reported data from Pakistan, the USA, Italy, and Iran (Fig. 1b) suggests that Pakistan may be the next country to see an exponential rise in rates of COVID-19 transmission and death [9].",
