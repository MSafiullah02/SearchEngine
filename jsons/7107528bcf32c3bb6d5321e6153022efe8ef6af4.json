COVID-19 can cause multiple organ dysfunction, such as respiratory and circulatory failure, liver and kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thromboembolism, and even death. The World Health Organization reports that the mortality rate of severe-type COVID-19 is over 50%. Currently, the number of severe cases worldwide has increased rapidly, but the experience in the treatment of infected patients is still limited. Given the lack of specific antiviral drugs, multi-organ function support treatment is important for patients with COVID-19. To improve the cure rate and reduce the mortality of patients with severe-and critical-type COVID-19, this paper summarizes the experience of organ function support in patients with severe-and criticaltype COVID-19 in Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. This paper systematically summarizes the procedures of functional support therapies for multiple organs and systems, including respiratory, circulatory, renal, hepatic, and hematological systems, among patients with severe-and critical-type COVID-19. This paper provides a clinical reference and a new strategy for the optimal treatment of COVID-19 worldwide.",

Aside from respiratory dysfunction, the disease also causes severe injuries to the circulatory, kidney, hepatic, and hematological systems and even leads to death [1, 2] . Therefore, we mainly referred to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19 (7th interim edition) [3] and other relevant guidelines and references, summarized the clinical experience, and compiled the organ dysfunction diagnosis and treatment plan of COVID-19.",

The IL-2R levels of patients with severe-and critical-type COVID-19 are 902 AE 51 U/mL and 1185 AE 80 U/mL, respectively, and their IL-6 levels are 52 AE 11 ng/L and 108 AE 12 ng/L, respectively [4] .

Therefore, oxygen saturation remains poor in some patients after tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. Inability of weaning from mechanical ventilation also leads to complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, in the later weeks of treatment. The mortality of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation remains high because of the abovementioned factors. NIV has the advantage of positive pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can prevent partial alveolar collapse and improve ventilation/ perfusion defects. Therefore, we recommend NIV assistance for patients with severe tendencies who can tolerate NIV. The initial parameters could set to IPAP 8-10 cmH 2 O, EPAP 5-8 cmH 2 O, and FiO 2 100%. If the patient cannot tolerate that situation at the initial stage, adjust-ments should be made in terms of nasal mask selection, sealing, parameters, and so on. The observation time of using a NIV is generally 2 h (dynamic adjustment parameters during the period according to the patient's condition, tidal volume (Vt), and blood oxygen saturation). If this situation of Vt \u2264 9 mL/kg, RR \u2264 30 times/min, PaO 2 /FiO 2 can be maintained, NIV may continue; if Vt 9-12 mL/kg, PaO 2 /FiO 2 is stable, close monitoring should be performed for 6 h, if Vt > 12 mL/kg or PaO 2 /FiO 2 gets worse, NIV should be stopped and replaced with tracheal intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation.",

After setting Vt, the pressure index must be monitored and the pressure of the inhalation platform must be controlled below 30 cmH 2 O. When the airway platform pressure is \u2264 35 cmH 2 O, high PEEP can be used appropriately. Airway warming and humidification should be emphasized to avoid blood crust and mucus plug to block airways. If the platform pressure is > 30 cmH 2 O or the driving pressure is > 15 cmH 2 O, Vt should be gradually reduced at a speed of 1mL/kg until the platform pressure < 30 cmH 2 O and the driving pressure < 15 cmH 2 O or Vt is reduced to 4 mL/kg (ideal body weight). At the same time, Vt is lowered and RR is increased to ensure alveolar minute ventilation and avoid CO 2 retention. For every 1 mL/kg Vt reduction, RR needs to be increased 5 times per minute. After increasing the RR, ventilator flow rate time curve should be observed. If the spontaneous breathing is too strong and the Vt is too large ( > 8 mL/kg), the sedative and analgesic dose can be increased and muscle relaxants can be used for a short time. If the CO 2 retention is still progressive, prone position ventilation (PPV) or ECMO is recommended [6, 7, 9] .",

The former commonly includes recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator rt-PA and r-PA, whereas the latter are streptokinase and urokinase. Common dose: rPA: 10 MU of this product is dissolved in 10 mL injection water each time, slowly pushed in 2-5 min. Another 10 MU can be used if necessary. The interval between the two times is about 30 min. A separate intravenous pathway should be used during injection and should not be mixed with other drugs. It also should not be given in common with other drugs. rt-PA: 50-100 mg is given intravenously and lasts for 2-4 h. The first dose of UK (4000 U/kg) is injected intravenously within 30 min, followed by drip of 600 000-1.2 million unit within 2-4 h.",
