Over-expression of M caused a rough-eye phenotype in adult flies, as shown by the loss of regularity of external eye morphology (Fig. 4\nC), while the over-expression of the EGFP control protein (Fig. 4B) did not show any obvious dominant eye malformation phenotype. To determine the subcellular localization of M in Drosophila, we performed immunofluorescence staining in third instar larval eye discs (Fig. 4D and F). Similar to mammalian cells (Fig. 1E), M displayed a punctate cytoplasmic localization in fly cells (Fig. 4F), whereas the EGFP control protein showed homogeneous intracellular localization (Fig. 4E).",

To further confirm the pro-apoptotic role of M, we co-expressed two anti-apoptotic factors, P35 (a viral caspase inhibitor) and the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (DIAP1) protein, independently with M.

Since the phosphorylation state of Akt is an essential cell survival indicator, we then argued if M-over-expression would affect Akt1 phosphorylation.

In the present study, we showed that M protein partially localized with the Golgi body (Fig. 1G) which is consistent with previous findings [46], [47].

HEK293T cells are commonly used in the functional studies of SARS-CoV proteins [21], [30], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52]. Because of its powerful genetics, Drosophila has been used as an in vivo model to study viral gene functions [53], [54], [55], [56]. Previously, our group established a transgenic Drosophila model to study the roles of the SARS-CoV 3a gene product [16]. We showed that over-expression of 3a induced apoptosis in Drosophila, and the results were consistent with a parallel investigation in mammalian cells [17]. In addition, co-expression of 3a, M and E proteins in insect cells can promote the formation of viral-like particles [57]. All these findings illustrate that non-mammalian systems, particularly Drosophila in this study, are plausible models for the studies of viral gene functions in vivo.",

Common morphological apoptotic features including cell shrinkage, condensed chromatin and apoptotic body formation are all observed in SARS-CoV viral-infected cells [13]. Swelling of mitochondria is also found in viral-infected cells [13] which indicates a mitochondrial involvement in SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis. At the mechanistic level, SARS-CoV infection has been shown to interfere with the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic pathway [15]. In this study, we observed that both the in vitro (Fig. 2) and in vivo (Fig. 5) over-expression of M protein induced apoptotic cell death. We also observed nuclear condensation (Fig. 2H) and mis-localization of mitochondrial cytochrome c protein in M-expressing cells (Fig. 3C). Our findings are therefore well in line with the previously described pro-apoptotic properties of SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "In apoptotic cells, holo-cytochrome c protein released from mitochondria triggers the formation of apoptosome and activates the caspase cascades to promote apoptosis [58]. It was reported that the expression of apo-cytochrome c protein (without heme group) is able to compete with holo-cytochrome c (with heme group) for Apaf1, which in turn blocks caspase activation and inhibits apoptosis [40]. We showed that over-expression of apo-cytochrome c blocked M-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5E, J and K, [16]). Caspase activation has been shown to be involved in SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis [15]. Previous studies also revealed that SARS-CoV viral proteins are able to activate individual caspases. For example, N activates caspase-3 and -7 [12], 3a activates caspase-8 [17], and 7a activates caspase-3 [18]. To test the involvement of caspases in M-induced apoptosis, we treated M-expressing cells with caspase inhibitors and found that M-induced nuclear condensation could be prevented by inhibitors specific for caspase-3, -8 and -9 (Fig. 3G). Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (DIAP1) and the baculoviral caspase inhibitor protein P35 are effective broad-range inhibitors of caspase activation in Drosophila\n[59], [60]. When we co-expressed M with either DIAP1 (Fig. 5H and K) or P35 (Fig. 5I and K) in vivo, we found that M-induced apoptosis was suppressed. The incomplete inhibition of apoptosis by specific caspases-3, -8 and -9 inhibitors (Fig. 3G) underscores the involvement of other caspases in M-induced apoptosis.",

Caspase-9 is one of the phosphorylation targets of Akt, and the protease activity of caspase-9 is reduced upon Akt phosphorylation [66]. In addition, it is known that caspase-8 activity is also regulated indirectly through Akt [67]. The Akt pathway has been implicated in viral infections [24] including SARS-CoV [5], [9], [11]. A weak activation of the Akt cellular pro-survival pathway has been observed in viral-infected cells as evidenced by transient phosphorylation of Akt, GSK-3\u03b2 and PKC\u03b6 kinases [5], [9], [11]. Such transient activation would reflect the inability of viral-infected cells to continuously combat with viral infection. In this report, we showed that over-expression of the M protein caused down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation without affecting total Akt protein level (Fig. 7). Such action would therefore contribute to the reduction of the cell survival signal, which in turn lead to the apoptotic induction.",

(A\u2013C) PDK-1 over-expression suppressed M-induced rough-eye phenotype. gmr-GAL4 alone control showed no dominant eye phenotype (A). The M-induced rough-eye phenotype (B) was suppressed by over-expression of PDK-1 (C). In the presence of GAL4, PDK-1EP837 causes over-expression of endogenous PDK-1[35]. (D\u2013F) PDK-1 over-expression suppressed M-induced apoptosis as shown by acridine orange (AO) staining. The elevated number of AO-positive cells caused by M protein over-expression in imaginal eye discs (E) was reduced upon the over-expression of PDK-1 (F). Arrows indicate morphogenetic furrows. (G) The number of AO-positive cells in each genotype was quantified. Results were plotted as the number of AO-positive cells and expressed as means + SEM of three-independent experiments. At least nine imaginal eye discs were analyzed in each genotype. \u2217p < 0.05 versus gmr-GAL4; #p < 0.05 versus gmr-GAL4 UAS-Membrane.",
