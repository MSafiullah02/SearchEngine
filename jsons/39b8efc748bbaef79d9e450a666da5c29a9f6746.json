A common theme in the public health response to COVID19 and similar threats is 40 the lack of rapidly deployable testing in the field to screen large numbers of individuals in exposed areas, 41 international ports of entry, and testing in quarantine locations such as the home residences, as well as 42 low-resourced areas (6). This hampers case finding and increases the number of individuals at risk of 43 exposure and infection. With the ease of travel across continents, delayed testing and lack of screening 44 programs in the field, global human-to-human transmission will continue at high rates. These factors 45 make a pandemic very difficult to contain. Early identification of the virus and rapid deployment of a 46 targeted point of care test (POCT) can stem the spread through immediate quarantine of infected 47 persons(7). We used existing viral genome sequences to develop a SARS-CoV-2 loop mediated 48 amplification (LAMP) assay for clinical use and evaluated whether an extraction-free and instrument-49 free approach could be achieved (8, 9) . POCT requires portability and low complexity without reliance on 50 sophisticated extraction and read-out instrumentation. Furthermore, LAMP relies on an alternate set of 51 reagent chemistry that does not depend on or hinder critical elements of the RT-PCR supply chain which 52",

In particular, RT-PCR has been employed as the primary 239 diagnostic counter-measure (20). However, reagent supply chains for key items are under immense 240 pressure. Local solutions to reagent sources have become paramount because barriers to trade of these 241 selected items have been a concern. 242 We noted that a one false negative occurred with single-target LAMP (S gene) for a lower Ct value 243 sample that may be due to genetic polymorphism at key residues where LAMP primers bind. This issue 244 was overcome by using two targets (S and RdRP genes) simultaneously. The single and dua-target RT-245 LAMP test for SARS-CoV-2 has comparable analytical sensitivity and achieved excellent agreement with 246 the reference method. We noted that at high Ct value (>35), and presumably low-level infection, E gene 247 RT-PCR identified specimens that LAMP did not. This suggests the LOD of the RT-PCR used in this study 248 may be superior to LAMP for these low positives. However, we note that samples with E gene RT-PCR Ct 249 values greater than 35 are relatively rare (~1%) at our reference laboratory (our unpublished 250 observations). Increasing LAMP reaction times may reduce false negatives, but also lead to spurious 251 amplification. The clinical relevance of these low positives is still not well understood and could 252 represent early infection during the incubation period, late infection after the initial viral peak, or 253 asymptomatic carriage. The transmissibility of these low positives to others is also not well understood. 254",

These values clearly support the use of 256 LAMP as an alternative NAAT. 257 LAMP does not rely on the same reagents as RT-PCR and thus alleviates pressure on key supply chain 258 items. The LAMP method is amenable to high throughput testing in either 96-well or 384-well. The assay 259 is also able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in VTM without the need for a kit-based RNA extraction method 260 relying on commercial reagents. However, we noted a 2-log drop in analytical sensitivity when direct 261 LAMP was performed following this heat step. The drop in analytical sensitivity will only affect low-level 262 viral load specimens. This is still within a good range compared to RT-PCR using RNA isolation. We 263 believe that addition of a buffer to stabilize the RNA-enzyme complex in the LAMP reaction may further 264 enhance this extraction-free approach. This needs to be tested. The heat step at 95 o C for 3 minutes 265 should significantly inactivate the virus permitting safe operation of the assay in a Class II biosafety 266 cabinet (21).

These data 269 demonstrated that lyophilized GspSSD2 and reagents are able to amplify SARS-CoV-2 directly from a 270 specimen without a kit-based RNA extraction. Additionally, visual detection with a simple blue LED light 271 is able to discriminate positive from negative. These features are particularly useful for resource-limited 272 settings without sophisticated laboratory infrastructure or where the cost of or access to kit-based 273 reagents and equipment are prohibitive. Further studies are required to clinically validate this low-cost 274 approach. 275",

The assay was optimized with 92 pre-addition of 0.5\u00b5L of 50X SYBR green (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) in the 25 \u00b5L reaction mixture. For 93 all LAMP experiments, 10 \u00b5L of template was used in the 25 \u00b5L reaction mixture. For dual-target LAMP, 94 identical reagent composition was used except the primers (6 per target) that were added at double 95 concentration and one half the volume for each primer set. Amplification was measured through 96 increased relative fluorescence units (RFU) per minute in the CFX-96 Real-Time PCR detection system 97",

EGFP forming units ranging from 10 6 -125 10 8 /mL were obtained for various recombinant virus stocks. Maintenance of the SARS/CoV2-targetted 126 sequences in the recombinant virus was confirmed using RT-PCR with primers targeting the flanking SV 127 sequences. Virus particles were serially diluted from 100 to 0.001 SV EGFP forming units per \uf06dL, and 128 RNA was extracted with the QiaAmp Viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Toronto, ON). Extracted RNA was 129 subjected to TURBO\u2122 DNase (ThermoFisher, Toronto, ON) digestion. Dilutions were subjected to LAMP 130 reactions as described above. 131 tested in the single-target S gene LAMP validation study. In the negative panel, four common human 134 coronavirus RNA (strain 0C43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Influenza 135 H1N1 clinical samples were included to evaluate the specificity of the test. Contrived samples were 136 generated by inoculating the artificial gene DNA construct described earlier into VTM from NP swabs. 137 Extraction of RNA from clinical samples was performed using the NUCLISENS easyMAG system 138 (Biomerieux, Durham, NC) or QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Toronto, ON) depending on specimen 139",
