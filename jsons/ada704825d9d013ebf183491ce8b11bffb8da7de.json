In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This pathological cascade resembles what is observed in other lethal viral lung infections, where the immune response to the virus triggers a primary wave of cytokines, including Type I and Type III interferons (IFNs), followed by infiltration and activation of diverse immune cells and production of secondary cytokines and chemokines, including Type II IFN (IFN-g), accelerated immune activation, and progressive decline of respiratory function (7) .

Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 at the time of hospitalization were reported to be significantly higher in patients who eventually died versus those that survived (5) . In a different study, patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) showed significantly higher levels of IL-2, IL-10, IL-7, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, G-CSF, and TNF-\u03b1 relative to non-ICU patients (6) . Using artificial intelligence methods, high levels of circulating alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a marker of liver inflammation, was associated with progression toward ARDS (8) . Altogether, these findings support the rationale for combining antiviral treatment and targeted immunosuppression as a therapeutic approach in COVID-19 (9) . Accordingly, several clinical trials are currently testing the safety and efficacy of inhibitors of IL-6 signaling and JAK/STAT signaling. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine, a molecule shown to attenuate Toll-like receptor signaling and cytokine production that is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (10, 11) , is also being testing in many clinical trials for COVID-19.",

            "text": "Within this context, we report here relevant results obtained during studies of the hyperactive immune response in a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS). We recently discovered that trisomy 21 (T21), the genetic cause of DS, causes consistent activation of the IFN transcriptional response in multiple cell types (12) (13) (14) (15) , which is explained by the fact that four of the six IFN receptors are encoded on chromosome 21 (IFNAR1, IFNAR2, IFNGR2, IL10RB). Additional investigations of the proteome (16), metabolome (14) , and immune cell lineages (13, 15) of people with DS demonstrated that T21 causes: 1) changes in the circulating proteome indicative of chronic autoinflammation with clear dysregulation of IFN-inducible cytokines (16) , 2) activation of the IFN-inducible kynurenine pathway, leading to elevated production of neurotoxic tryptophan catabolites (14) , and 3) widespread hypersensitivity to IFN stimulation across the human immune system (13, 15) . Altogether, these results support the notion that DS can be understood in good measure as an interferonopathy, whereby increased IFN signaling could account for many of the developmental and clinical impacts of T21. Now, we report results generated during our investigation of immune responses in the Dp16(1)/Yey mouse strain (referred hereto as Dp16) (17) , a widely used mouse model of DS. The Dp16 strain carries a segmental duplication of murine chromosome 16 that is syntenic to human chromosome 21, encoding ~119 genes, including the four Ifnrs. We found that Dp16 mice overexpress Ifnrs in all   immune cell types tested, display hypersensitivity to Type I and Type II IFN stimulation, overproduce key cytokines, and display increased liver inflammation. Remarkably, Dp16 mice display lethal immune responses upon challenge with viral mimetic molecules, such as the TLR3 agonist poly-I:C [P(I:C)] or the TLR7/8 agonist imiquimod, a phenotype that is not observed in their wild type (WT) littermates or mouse strains carrying triplications of other genomic regions syntenic to chromosome 21. Strikingly, both the lethal immune phenotype and associated cytokine storm are blocked by treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1 kinase, which also decreases liver pathology.",

Chronic systemic induction of IFN signaling was elicited by repeated administration of the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [P(I:C)], which is known to produce an acute spike of Type I IFN production (1-3 days), followed by low but persistent expression of Type I IFN ligands and a robust cytokine response in the chronic phase (5-30 days) (20) . WT and Dp16 mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg of P(I:C) or an equivalent volume of vehicle (sham) every other day, for up to 16 days, with the experiment completed at day 17. Remarkably, Dp16 mice were profoundly sensitive to the treatment, which was largely tolerated by WT mice (Figure   2A ). Body weight measurements during the course of the experiment revealed rapid weight loss in Dp16 mice upon treatment ( Figure 2B) . Eventually, all but one of the twelve Dp16 mice had to be removed from the study for excessive weight loss (>15%). In contrast, WT animals did not lose as much weight, and all but three out of nine survived to the end of the experiment (Figure   2A ,B). Dp10 and Dp17 mice also tolerated chronic immune stimulation with P(I:C) (Figure 2C-F). Although P(I:C) treatment caused some weight loss in both Dp10 and Dp17 mice, the percentage lost was comparable to WT levels. This P(I:C)-induced weight loss was clearly dosedependent, as mice receiving half the lethal dose (5 mg/kg) displayed only minor weight loss, with no observable differences between Dp16 and WT mice ( Figure S1 ).",

Prompted by these results, we investigated liver pathology. Liver tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and evaluated by a trained histologist, blinded against treatment group and genotype. Scoring of liver pathology was done with procedures adapted for mice (23) using a validated histological scoring system (24) , that included parameters such as cell injury, inflammation, and reactive changes, leading to an overall liver pathology score. This analysis revealed that Dp16 mice have increased liver pathology even before P(I:C) treatment, as demonstrated by significantly higher levels of cell injury, inflammation, and reactive changes relative to their WT littermates (Figure 4B,C) . This basal level of liver pathology was not observed in the Dp10 and Dp17 mice (Figure 4D,E) .",

Therefore, we sought to determine whether inhibiting JAK1 specifically would block the lethality and pathology caused by P(I:C) treatment in Dp16 mice. To this end, we used the JAK1-specific inhibitor INCB54707. Animals received a dose of 60 mg/kg of INCB54707 (or an equivalent volume of methylcellulose used as the vehicle) twice daily via oral gavage, beginning 24 hours prior to the first P(I:C) injection, and every day during the course of the experiment. Remarkably, Dp16 mice that received the JAK1 inhibitor all survived the P(I:C) treatment, while Dp16 animals that received the vehicle and P(I:C) experienced weight loss and had to be euthanized ( Figure 5A) . We then analyzed the impact of JAK1 inhibition on cytokine production by comparing the Dp16 mice treated with P(I:C) with and without co-treatment with the JAK1 inhibitor. Importantly, cytokine production was strongly abrogated by JAK1 inhibition (Figure 5B and Figure S3) . Lastly, we evaluated the impact of JAK1 inhibition on markers of liver inflammation and injury. Indeed, the JAK1 inhibitor led to a reduction of circulating levels of ALT and AST, as well as a decrease in overall liver pathology scores ( Figure 5C) .",

We show that eliciting the innate anti-viral immune response with TLR agonists is lethal in a sensitized mouse model carrying triplication of four of the six IFN receptors. Within days, the Dp16 mice rapidly lose weight and die if unattended, concurrent with induction of many prominent cytokines linked to the severity of COVID-19-driven pathology, such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1\u03b1 (6) .

Schematic of human chromosome 21, including the interferon receptor gene cluster (IFNRs) and syntenic regions triplicated in mouse models of Down syndrome. The IFNR gene cluster encodes four of 8 the six IFN receptors: IFNAR1, IFNAR2, IFNGR2, and IL10RB. B. Flow cytometric analysis of IFNAR1 cell surface expression on CD45+ white blood cells (WBC) from the indicated mouse strains. Data are presented as ratios of the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (RFI) of IFNAR1 on WBC, relative to WT littermates. C. Volcano plot showing the fold change of IFNAR1 surface expression levels (Dp16 vs. WT) for 11 immune cell types. D-F. WBC from the indicated strains and WT littermates were stimulated with IFN-\u237a (10,000 U/mL) for 30 minutes and phosphorylation of STAT1 was analyzed via flow cytometry for nine cell types.

Second, there is no active viral infection or adaptive immune responses in our model. Furthermore, the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other lethal viruses that induce cytokine storms encode for proteins that modulate the immune response, including anti-IFN factors (27, 28), and it is unclear how these viral factors may modulate the course of disease and response to JAK inhibitors. Lastly, there may be significant differences in the course of a cytokine storm initiated from the lung tissue, as opposed to the more systemic response elicited in our model. Nevertheless, our results justify a thorough analysis of JAK inhibitors in pre-clinical models and clinical trials in the ongoing efforts to attenuate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the four IFNRs encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered a high-risk population during the COVID-19",

All molecular and cellular biology experiments were performed with validated reagents by trained personnel. All data generated is made publicly available in the enclosed Supplemental Materials. Mice. The Dp(10Prmt2-Pdxk)1Yey/J (Dp(10)1Yey/ + ), Dp(16Lipi-Zbtb21)1Yey/J (Dp(16)1Yey/ + ), and Dp(17Abcg1-Rrp1b)1(Yey)/J (Dp(17)1Yey/ + ) strains have been previously described (18). Dp16 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories or provided by Drs. Faycal Guedj and Diana Bianchi at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Animals were maintained on the C57BL/6J background and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions. Chronic P(I:C) treatment. Vaccigrade P(I:C) (high molecular weight) was purchased from Invivogen and reconstituted in saline according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mice were injected with P(I:C) at 10 mg/kg of body weight at 2-day intervals for up to 16 days. Weight was monitored throughout the duration of the experiment. Animals were sacrificed one day after the final dose (day 17) or when they lost more than 15% of their body weight. For molecular analysis, tissues were minced into small pieces and homogenized for 20 seconds in matrix Lyse-D tubes containing RLT and 0.143M b-mercaptoethanol. INCB54707 (JAKi) treatment. Mice were treated with 60 mg/kg of INCB54707 (or an equivalent volume of 0.5% methylcellulose vehicle) twice daily via oral gavage, beginning 24 hours prior to the first P(I:C) injection, and every day during the course of the experiment. IFN stimulations and intracellular staining. Peripheral blood was collected from the submandibular vein into Lithium Heparin tubes. 25 \u00b5L of blood were transferred to a 96-well plate, briefly subjected to RBC lysis, and then re-suspended in 30 \u00b5L of media containing 10,000 units/mL of recombinant IFN-a2a or 100 units/mL of recombinant IFN-g (R&D Systems). Antibodies against SiglecF, Ly6C, CD115 and CD11b and mouse FC receptors were also included in the stimulation media. Cells were stimulated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C, washed once in cold FACS buffer, then fixed in 200 \u00b5L of BD Lyse-Fix buffer for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were permeabilized for 30 minutes in ice-cold permeabilization buffer III (BD phospho-flow). Following permeabilization cells were stained with the following antibodies conjugated to fluorophores: CD3 (17A2), CD4, CD8 (53.6.7), B220, Ly6C, MHCII, NK1.1 and phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701).",
