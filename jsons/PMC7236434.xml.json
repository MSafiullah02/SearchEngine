We extended analyses from prior studies that used NFCS data to examine preparedness for financial emergencies (Babiarz and Robb 2014; Woodyard et al. 2017) to contribute to the literature in four ways. First, we systematically introduced additional variables using hierarchical regression to test Sherraden\u2019s (2013) conceptual model of financial capability. We examined the degree to which objective and subjective financial knowledge, financial confidence, and savings account ownership explained the probability of having an emergency fund. Second, we tested a series of interactions to determine whether income moderated the relationship between constructs in Sherraden's model and having an emergency fund. Third, we added economic constraint and homeownership as additional controls found to be associated with household financial assets. Fourth, we assessed the stability of our findings across four cross-sectional waves (2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018) of National Financial Capability Studies (NFCS).",

The life cycle hypothesis (LCH) posits that individuals plan and adjust their consumption and saving over their life cycle to smooth consumption (Modigliani 1966). Yet Browning and Lusardi (1996) note that the PIH and LCH are theories of consumption, with saving being merely residual, not intentional. In contrast, the precautionary savings motive contends that individuals defer present consumption to insure against future income uncertainty (Leland 1978). Similarly, the buffer-stock hypothesis suggests that individuals adjust their consumption based on a target for asset accumulation sufficient to smooth consumption given expected future income (Carroll 1997; Deaton 1991).",

This combination of knowledge and skill is reflected in Sherraden's (2013) model of financial capability. For example, Rothwell et al. (2016) found that the relationship between financial knowledge and emergency savings was mediated by financial self-efficacy and that knowledge alone did not predict savings outcomes. Consistent with Huston\u2019s (2010) definitions, Sherraden (2013) described financial literacy as having the ability to act based on having both financial knowledge and skills. When combined with financial inclusion\u2014the opportunity to act by accessing safe and affordable financial services\u2014financial literacy leads to improved financial behavior.",

This variable was included as a predictor because having a bank account is not a necessary precondition of setting aside money for emergencies (FDIC 2018; Grinstein-Weiss et al. 2015; Thompson et al. 2020;). Furthermore, the dependent variable was measured by responses to a question about setting aside funds for emergencies, not conditional on doing so using a savings account. If owning a savings account and having an emergency fund were measuring the same phenomenon, we would expect the correlation between these two variables to be very high. However, savings account ownership was only moderately correlated with having an emergency fund (r = 0.30 to 36 across study years) while objective and subjective financial knowledge and financial confidence were similarly correlated with having an emergency fund (r = 0.21 to 0.33 across study years). In addition, the proportion of households that had an emergency fund but not a savings account ranged from 11 to 20% across study years which is similar to other survey estimates (FDIC 2018). These findings suggested that responses in the NFCS regarding savings account ownership and having an emergency fund were sufficiently independent and measured different phenomena.",

Ability to cover expenses also partially reflects cost of living and thus is an important variable to include in addition to income in models predicting having an emergency fund. For example, households living in urban areas with high housing costs may have greater difficulty setting aside money for emergencies, all other things being equal (e.g., income). Furthermore, homeownership is correlated with savings (Di et al. 2007; Friedline et al. 2014; Krumm and Kelly 1989; Friedline and Freeman 2016), including having an emergency fund (West and Mottola 2016). Thus, ability to cover expenses and homeownership were added as covariates to models for sensitivity tests. A dummy variable was created for homeownership to indicate whether the respondent owned their home. Lastly, ability to cover expenses was measured based on responses to the following question: \u2018In a typical month, how difficult is it for you to cover your expenses and pay all your bills?\u2019. A dummy variable was coded as \u20181\u2032 if the respondent said, \u2018not at all difficult\u2019 and \u20180\u2032 if the respondent replied \u2018somewhat\u2019 or \u2018very\u2019 difficult.",

The objective financial knowledge items assess knowledge concerning compound interest, inflation, bond pricing, mortgage payments, and portfolio diversification. Despite the popularity of using these items in research on consumer finance, these items may be poor indicators of financial knowledge for individuals who have limited or no experience with credit cards, owning a home, and/or retirement accounts. This relates to what Sherraden (2013) observes as the interaction between financial knowledge and skills and financial inclusion. For example, there are over 45 million consumers who are \"credit invisible\" meaning they lack a credit history with the three credit reporting agencies or have \"thin\" credit histories that cannot be scored. As a result, these consumers lack access to credit (Brevoort et al. 2016), which means they may be unfamiliar with credit-related financial concepts such as loan interest. Similarly, over a third of the NFCS 2018 sample do not own homes and a majority have no investments, which means they are probably unfamiliar with mortgage and investment concepts, respectively. Thus, given that higher-income consumers are more likely to enjoy access to credit and own homes and investments, these items may have a distinct socioeconomic status bias, while not directly measuring knowledge concerning precautionary saving.",

Measured differently, objective financial knowledge may have a stronger association with having money for emergencies than we discovered. Our finding concerning subjective financial knowledge corroborates this point. The lower respondents assessed their financial knowledge, the less likely they reported having an emergency fund. This suggests that financial education efforts should be tailored to address specific financial health concerns such as the need to build emergency savings. This idea is consistent with the \"just in time\" hypothesis of financial education based on the recognition that outcomes of general financial education are limited and decay over time (Fernandes et al. 2014).",

Thus, financial counselors and coaches could help households identify ways to create financial slack, not just through reducing expenses\u2014the usual focus of these services, but by maximizing use of existing public resources (e.g. tax credits, housing, food, child care, and health care subsidies) and increasing income (e.g., job training, additional education, microenterprise, small business development) (Anderson et al. 2004). Another strategy is to integrate financial education and counseling in services and systems aimed at increasing household income, such as workforce development.",
