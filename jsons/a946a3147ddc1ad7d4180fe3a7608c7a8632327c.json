According to the news, that particular day saw a discussion on the death toll in mainland China reaching 100. 5 On the same day, Japan also observed a sharp rise in the relevant microblogs, as shown in Figure 1(c) . This was a result of many users tweeting extensively about the three newly confirmed cases in Japan, which included people who had not been to Wuhan. 6 Subsequently, there was a substantial increase in the English microblogs on February 25, 2020, as shown in Figure 1(a) .

Meanwhile, in Japan, the number of daily confirmed cases was relatively small as shown in Figure 1 (d). Therefore, we assumed that Japanese Twitter users are not as interested in COVID-19 as in the major English-speaking countries. In particular, there was a decline in the number of microblogs from March 12 to March 15, 2020. March 12, 2020, was the Olympic flame lighting ceremony and the torch relay for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. 8 Therefore, we speculate that this sudden decrease was caused by a shift in attention from COVID-19 to the torch relay for many Japanese users.",

The results of the analyses are summarized as follows. For China, which is the first country to have faced a full-blown outbreak of COVID-19, we can observe from social media that people took the situation and prevention seriously. As the number of confirmed cases in China decreased, the trend in social media shifted toward the concern for the global situation. In the UK and the US, the main English-speaking countries, initially, there was less social media interests owing to fewer confirmed cases. The subsequent outbreaks sprung the discussion about COVID-19 on social media, including the promotion of precautionary measures and recommendations to keep \"social distancing\" measures. Meanwhile, Japan showed relatively sluggish growth. However, on March 24, 2020, the announcement of the postponement of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo along with a relatively rapid growth of confirmed cases was reflected in the increased social media activity. This was accompanied by microblogs expressing concerns about the epidemic and dissatisfaction with government measures.",
