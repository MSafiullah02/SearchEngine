Task 2-Event extraction over chemical reactions-involves event trigger detection and argument recognition. We briefly present the motivations and goals of the ChEMU tasks, as well as resources and evaluation methodology.",

However, new chemical compounds are often initially disclosed in patent documents, and only a small fraction of these compounds are published in journals, usually taking an additional 1-3 years after the patent [13] . Therefore, most chemical compounds are only available through patent documents [3] . In addition, chemical patent documents contain unique information, such as reactions, experimental conditions, mode of action, which is essential for the understanding of compound prior art, providing a means for novelty checking and validation as well as pointers for chemical research in both academia and industry [1, 2] . As the number of new chemical patent applications has been drastically increasing [11] , it is becoming crucial to develop natural language processing (NLP) approaches that enable automatic extraction of key information from the chemical patents [2] .",

In particular, we will focus on two key information extraction tasks of chemical named entity recognition (NER) and chemical reaction event extraction. While previous related shared tasks focusing on chemicals or drugs such as CHEMDNER [7] have also included chemical named entity recognition as a task, those have primarily focused on PubMed abstracts. The CHEMDNER patents task [8] was limited to entity mentions and chemical entity passage detection, and only considered titles and abstracts of patents. For our ChEMU lab, we extend the existing corpora in several directions: first, we go beyond chemical NER to require labeling of the role of a chemical with respect to a reaction, and to consider complete chemical reactions in addition to entities. The ChEMU website is available at: http:// chemu.eng.unimelb.edu.au.",

Task 1 involves identifying chemical compounds and their specific types, i.e. to assign the label of a chemical compound according to the role which it plays within a chemical reaction. In addition to chemical compounds, this task also requires identification of the temperatures and reaction times at which the chemical reaction is carried out, as well as yields obtained for the final chemical product and the label of the reaction. This task involves both entity boundary prediction and entity label classification. We define 10 different entity type labels as shown in Table 1 . See examples of those entity types in Table 2 .",
