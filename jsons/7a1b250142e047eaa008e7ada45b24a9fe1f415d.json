Few-shot learning has not been investigated in this area although it enables EC models to extend their operation to unobserved event types. To fill in this gap, in this work, we investigate event classification under the few-shot learning setting. We propose a novel training method for this problem that extensively exploit the support set during the training process of a few-shot learning model. In particular, in addition to matching the query example with those in the support set for training, we seek to further match the examples within the support set themselves. This method provides more training signals for the models and can be applied to every metriclearning-based few-shot learning methods. Our extensive experiments on two benchmark EC datasets show that the proposed method can improve the best reported few-shot learning models by up to 10% on accuracy for event classification.",

As demonstrated by the examples, a notable challenge in EC is that the similar surface forms of the words might convey different events depending on the context. Two main methods have been employed for EC. The first approach explores linguistic features (e.g., syntactic and semantic properties) to train statistical models [9] . The second approach, on the other hand, focuses on developing deep neural network models (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)) to automatically learn effective features from large scale datasets [5, 13] . Due to the development of the deep learning models, the performance for EC has been improved significantly [14, 16, 17, 19, 23] .",

However, once a model is trained on the datasets with the given set of event types, it is unable to detect event mentions of unseen event types. To extend EC to new event types, a common solution is to annotate additional training data for such new event types and re-train the models, which is extremely expensive. It is thus desirable to formalize EC in the few-shot learning setting where the systems need to learn to recognize event mentions for new event types from a handful of examples. This is, in fact, closer to how humans learn to do tasks and make the EC models more applicable in practice. However, to our knowledge, there has been no prior work on few-shot learning for EC.",

This is done based on the matching information between the query example and those in the support set. To apply this setting to extract the examples of some new type, we need to collect just a few examples of the new type and add them to the support set to form a new class.

Some other examples are also chosen from the remaining examples of each sampled type to establish the query points.

The available matching information between the examples in the support set themselves is not yet explored in the existing few-shot learning work [26, 28] , especially for the NLP tasks [7] . While this approach can be acceptable for the tasks in computer vision, it might not be desirable for NLP applications, especially for EC. Overall, datasets in NLP are much smaller than those in computer vision, thus limiting the variety of the context for training purposes. The ignorance of the matching information for the examples in the support set might cause inefficiency in using the training data for EC where the models cannot fully exploit the available information and fail to achieve good performance. Consequently, in this work, we propose to simultaneously exploit the matching information between the examples in the support set and between the query examples with the examples in the support set to train the few-shot learning models for EC. This is done by adding additional terms in the loss function (i.e., the auxiliary losses) to capture the matching knowledge between the examples in the support set. We expect that this new training technique can better utilize the training data and improve the performance of few-shot learning in EC.",

The early studies apply transfer learning to fine-tune the pre-trained models, exploiting the latent information from the common classes with adequate instances [2, 4] . Metric learning, on the other hand, learns to model the distance distribution among the observed classes [10, 26, 28] . Recently, the idea of a fast learner that can generalize to a new concept quickly is introduced in meta-learning [6, 25] . Among these methods, metric-learning is more explainable and easier to train and implement compared to transfer learning and meta-learning. Notably, the prototypical networks in metric learning achieve state-of-the-art performance on several FSL benchmarks and show its robustness against noisy data [7, 26] . Although many FSL methods are proposed for image recognition [6, 10, 25, 26, 28] , there have been few studies investigating this setting for NLP problems [7, 29] .",

We also randomly initialize the position embedding vectors with 50 dimensions. The other parameters are selected based on the development data of the datasets, leading to similar parameters for both ACE 2005 and TAC KBP 2015. In particular, the CNN encoder contains a single CNN layer with window size 3 and 250 filters. We manage to use this simple CNN encoder to have a fair comparison with the previous study [7] . The Transformer encoder contains 2 layers with a context size of 512 and 10 heads in the attention mechanism. The number of examples per class in the auxiliary query sets Q is set to 2 while the trade-off parameter \u03bb in the loss function is 0.1. Table 1 shows the accuracy of the models (i.e., Matching, Proto, Proto+Att, and Relation) on the ACE 2005 test dataset, using the CNN encoder and Transformer encoder. There are several observations from the table. First, comparing the instance encoders, it is clear that the transformer encoder is significantly better than the CNN encoder across all the possible few-shot learning models and settings for EC. Second, comparing the few-shot learning models, the prototypical networks significantly outperform Matching and Relation with a large performance gap across all the settings. Among the prototypical networks, Proto+Att achieves better performance than Proto, thus confirming the benefits of the attention-based mechanism for the prototypical module. Third, comparing the pairs (5-way 5-shot vs 5-way 10-shot) and (10-way 5 shot vs 10 way 10 shot), we see that the performance of the models would be almost always better with larger K (i.e., the number of examples per class in the support set) on different settings, consistent with the natural intuition about the benefit of having more examples for training. Most importantly, we see that training the models with the LoLoss procedure would significantly improve the models' performance. This is true across different few-shot learning models, N-way K-shot settings, and encoder choices. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training procedure to exploit the matching information between examples in the support set for few-shot learning for EC. For simplicity, we only focus on the best few-shot learning models (i.e., the prototypical networks) and the Transformer encoder under 5-way 5-shot and 10-way 10-shot in the following analysis. Even though we show the results in fewer settings and models in Table 2 and 3, the same  trends are observed for the other models and settings as well.  Table 2 additionally reports the accuracy of Transformer-based models on the TAC KBP 2015 dataset. As we can see from the table, most of our observations for the ACE 2005 dataset still hold for TAC KBP 2015, once again confirming the advantages of the proposed LoLoss technique in this work. ",

In particular, in each training episode where a set of examples is sampled for each type in T to form the query set Q, we simulate the noisy data by randomly selecting a portion of the examples in Q for label perturbation. Essentially, for each example in the selected subset of Q, we change its original label to another random one in T , making it a noisy example with an incorrect label. By varying the size of the selected portion in Q for label perturbation, we can control the level of noise in the training process for FSL in EC. Table 3 shows the accuracy of the Proto+Att model on the ACE 2005 test set that employs the Transformer encoder with or without the LoLoss training procedure for different noise rates. As we can see from the table, the introduction of noisy data would, in general, degrade the accuracy of the models (i.e., comparing the cells in Table 3 with the Proto+Att based model in Table 1) . However, over different noise rates and N way K shot settings, the Proto+Att model trained with LoLoss is still always significantly better than those without LoLoss. The performance gap is substantial that is at least 4.5% over different settings. In fact, we see that LoLoss can improve Proto+Att in the noisy setting (i.e., at least 4.5%) more significantly than those in the setting without noisy data (i.e., at most 3.3% on the 5 way 5 shot and 10 way 10 shot settings in Table 1 ). Such evidence further confirms the effectiveness and robustness against noisy data of LoLoss for few-shot learning due to its exploitation of the matching information between the examples in the support set.",

            "text": "we want to maximize the numbers of examples in the training data, for each dataset (i.e., ACE 2005 or TAC KBP 2015), we choose the event subtypes in 4 event types that have the least number of examples in total and split at the ratio 1:1 into the test and development classes. Following this heuristics to select the classes, the event types used for training data in ACE 2005 involve Business, Contact, Conflict, and Justice while the event types for testing and development data are Life, Movement, Personnel, and Transaction. For TAC KBP 2015, the training classes include Business, Contact, Conflict, Justice, and Manufacture while the test and development classes consist of Life, Movement, Personnel, and Transaction. Finally, due to the intention to follow the prior work on fewshot learning with 10 examples per class in the support set and 5 examples per class in the query set for training [7], we remove the examples of any subtypes whose have less than 15 examples in the training, test and development sets of the datasets.",

            "text": "Matching the Examples in the Support Set: The typical loss function for few-shot learning in Eq. 5 aims to learn by matching the query example x with the examples in the support set S via the prototype vectors. An issue with this mechanism is it only employs the matching signals between the query example and the support examples for training. This can be acceptable for large datasets (e.g., in computer vision) where many examples can play the role of the query examples to provide sufficient training signals for the learning process. However, for EC, the available datasets are often small (e.g., the ACE 2005 dataset with only about a few thousands of annotated event mentions), making the sole reliance on the query examples for training signals less efficient. In other words, the few-shot learning framework might not be trained well with the limited data for the query matching for EC. Consequently, in this work, we propose to introduce more training signals for few-shot learning for EC by additionally exploiting the matching information among the examples in the support set themselves. In particular, as there are multiple examples (although only a few) per class/type in the support set, we select a subset of such examples for each type in S and enforce the models to be able to match such the selected examples to their corresponding types in the remaining support set.Formally, let S i",
