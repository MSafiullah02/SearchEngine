Ocular surface cooled during sustained eye opening and rate of the cooling was greater in the dry eye patient (mostly older people and video terminal operator)[6], while it increases to 36\u00b0-37\u00b0C at the conjunctival fornix . In the logical context of this paper, this would justify the related conjunctivitis SARS-CoV-2/19. Indeed, pharyngodinia and low-temperature related conjunctivitis is a common finding in respiratory virus infections. A report in The Lancet, raised concern that ocular surfaces may be a potential target for human- SARS-CoV-2 invasion via droplets, as published by Sun and Coll[7a,b] in two consecutive papers collected in two different period: in Huazhong province from the end of December 2019 till February 7th 2020, and in Hubei province in the second week of February 2020, that had similar results. Twelve (32%) patients in the first series had conjunctivitis with signs that included conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, and increased secretions. Of those patients, 11 (92%) tested positive for CoV-19 by nasopharyngeal swab. In one patient, epiphora was the first symptom of COVID-19. Twenty-eight (74%) of the 38 patients in the second one was positive for CoV-19 by nasopharyngeal swabs, of whom only two (5%) patients had a positive conjunctival specimen, whilst Guan and Coll[8] on NEJM, documented \u2018\u2019conjunctival congestion\u2019\u2019 in 9 of 1.099 patients (0,8%) across China, with laboratory confirmed CoV-19. So, a largely approximated valuation would point out about 0,8-5% locally positive patients of those affected by conjunctivitis in evolved stages[9] (the virus possibly vanished in the meantime or by therapy). Still remaining unknown the percentage in phenotype I and in asymptomatic pre-clinical (the majority!) patients. Aged patients have higher rate of dry eye that could justify or amplify the virus conjunctival access to the body, reaching the nose via the lacrimal ductus. Environmental control should therefore take into consideration topical humidification preferably with a cross-linked hyaluronate drops and a hot vaporization (suffumigation, water hot-humid vaporization (WHV)[10]) involving also the upper airways in mucosal continuity with the conjunctiva (FIG.2\n). It must be humid: an air dryer evaporates the tear film, drastically reduces lactoferrin, mucin trap-door effectiveness and macrophages activity; in addition to the peptidoglycan N-acetylmuramoyl hydrolase (i.e. Fleming's Lysozyme) whose catalysis rate is maximum at pH5.",

            "text": "Most respiratory virus may work and replicate at lower temperatures (34\u00b0-35\u00b0C) than the optimal range for epithelial tracheal-bronchial cells (37\u00b0-38\u00b0C) [10], either for mucin layer fluidity: exposed to lower temperatures may less react to fight infections. This also causes vasoconstriction reducing blood flow and mucin production. Increasing the air temperature, therefore keeping the upper tract and trachea-bronchial temperature higher, may reduce the replication and diffusion of the respiratory virus. Older people have a weak and altered thermoregulatory response while children, that quickly develop a high body temperature that may halt viral replication, and more balanced immune response, /may have a better chance of fighting infections. SARS-CoV-2 binding the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1\u03b2 which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1\u03b2which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis[11], cardiovascular implications[12], [13] for increased troponin T (TnT), C-reactive protein and terminal fragment of type B natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-proBNP), microvascular endothelial aggression and intestinal-pulmonary cross-talk, with link to colangiocyte ACE2 receptor, interfering with intestinal microbiota[14] requiring pro-biotic adjuvant therapy. This infectious disease mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome[11]. The two coronaviruses that preceded CoV-19 causing respectively the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pandemic of 2003[15] and the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2012[16], emerged during the summer and spring-summer season, thus not respecting the principle that \u201crespiratory viruses can only function (and replicate) at lower temperatures (i.e. 34-35\u00b0C)\u201d, as stated[10]. The MERS, moreover, is still ongoing in endemic form since 2012, therefore disrespectful of the summer-winter binomial. These concepts, are perhaps explainable that both viruses have made the so-called species jump (Spillover), thus modifying the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of both virus. SARS-CoV-2 probably behaves in the same way. Therefore, it cannot be accurately stated that this is thermolabile. The biological characteristics of the latter coronavirus are not yet known; SARS-CoV-2 also made the spillover, but passing directly from the bat to the man maybe without an intermediate host[17]. SARS-CoV-2, as the two recent zoonotic coronavirus, are enveloped viruses with round and sometimes pleiomorphic virions of approximately 80 to 120 nm in diameter. Coronaviruses contain positive-strand RNA, with the largest RNA genome (approximately 30 kb) reported to date. The genome RNA is complexed with the basic nucleocapsid (N) protein to form a helical capsid found within the viral membrane. The membranes of all coronaviruses contain at least three viral proteins, of which the most important is the spike (S), the type I glycoprotein that forms the peplomers on the virion surface, giving the virus its corona- or crown-like morphology in the electron microscope. The virus coating consists of a membrane that the virus \u201cinherits\u201d from the host cell after infecting it. As all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 needs an animal cell to survive and spread off. Out of this host, virus loses the ability to survive and infect. Degradation time depends on temperature, humidity and behavior and belongs to the capsid. For this reason, the foamy detergents are active for a contact of at least 20 ', the heat degrades the membrane lipids, as it happens for alcohol 65%, chloride in water 1/5 that directly destroys the protein, as for H2O2 at maximal concentration. It may remain stable in cold outside behavior or in the air conditioner for more than 3 hours and on surfaces for days[18], needing also humidity and obscurity, being destroyed by UV, hot, dried and illuminated environments. Up to now is unknown if SARS-CoV-2 induces viremia, as happens in Feline coronavirus[19] that also cause virus systemic spread, including inflammation of the abdominal and thoracic cavities and occasionally, other organs including brain[20] with confusion and epileptic crisis till neurological reliquate needing rehabilitation, as .experienced by many survivors. Anyway, even in the absence of precise data on viremia, we can with reasonable certainty state that SARS-CoV-2 runs down to the lung. The virus binds to the type II pneumocytes from lower bronchi via Spike protein (S-protein) [17] binding to virus receptors, of which the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is the most important[21]. In the respiratory tract, ACE2 receptor is widely expressed on type II pneumocytes of the alveoli, trachea, bronchi, bronchial submucous membrane serous glands[22], and alveolar monocytes and macrophages. The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 to the lungs causes primary severe viral interstitial pneumonia which in about 10% of cases can degenerate into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by a cytochemical storm triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6)[11]: the Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS). Blocking the initial binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor via the S protein could be one potential treatment approach avenue. In this context, most efforts are aimed at finding pharmacological molecules to inhibit this link. Monoclonal antibodies that target vulnerable sites on viral surface proteins are an emerging approach for treating some rheumatological disease including arthritis. In a study by Wang \net al.\n[23], a human antibody known as 47D11, targeting on communal epitope, was announced to bind to SARS-CoV-2 \nand SARS-CoV, and to potently inhibit the virus infection of Vero cells.",

In subsequent cases, the use of warmer humid air (40-41\u00b0C) in ventilation systems and artificial respirators (WHV) can kill viruses or stop their replication in the respiratory tree helping the recovery process; in fact, the correlation between lower air/environment temperatures and respiratory infections (especially acute viral infections) is one of the pillars of 'common' hygiene and medicine: most viruses die when exposed to warmer air.

IL-6R blocker protease inhibitors immunosuppressor humanized monoclonal antibody: suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family and IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections[11], to contrast or possibly avoid the CSS. Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-COV-2 causes an inflammatory response in the lower airway and leads to lung injury. Collectively, virus particles invade the respiratory mucosa first and infect other cells, triggering a powerful immune response with production of a cytokine storm, i.e. a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response in the body resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-\u03b1, TGF\u03b2, etc.) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, etc.) from immune-effector cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be associated with the critical condition of COVID-19 patients[33]. Besides these, other interesting active antiviral compound under evaluation are noticed; some are included in Box 2. In this setting, is already known that other Authors have also tested the inhalation of \u03b1-interferon by aerosol (5 million U at a time for adults in sterile water by injection, twice daily) with weak recommendation)\n[37]. Even tough suggested for reinforcing action on innate immune system, there are not yet confirmative results on BCG vaccination. The transplantation of ACE2-mesenchymal stem cells is still ongoing[38]. Anticoagulants (lmw Heparin) and Antibiotics (mainly Azithromycin) as supportive therapy are widely used. A wide range of competitors have a vaccine in the pipeline, with a large fundraising (even by B&M Gates Foundation), although vaccines seem less successful in older people, because aged immune system do not respond as well to immunization. To treat those infections more infectious and harmful for the elderly, called as geophilic and gerolavic infections, Zhakoronkov[39] on Aging, suggests Rapamycin, Nicotinamide riboside, Metformin, as geroprotectors with known safety profile, for precautionary measure. A tentative to empower the innate immunity with Pentraxin 3 (PTX-n3: a humoral pattern recognition molecule, protein active against other Coronaviruses), for control of Complement activation[40] to also be used as prognostic for death[41], [42] in the CSS, is just tested in an observational protocol at the Spallanzani (COVID Hospital) in Rome; lastly, a trial with Ruxolitinib\u00ae selective inhibitor of Janus associate Kinase (JAK1-2) is approved in Italy by AIFA (Italian Drug Agency), for compassionate use in selected severe patients (phenotypes IV \u2013 V). Our suggestion is to test remdesivir\u00ae (RDV) in the proposed set. Among antiretrovirals, RDV a novel anti-viral drug developed by Gilead Sciences, is a prodrug of a nucleotide analogue that is intracellularly metabolized to an analogue of adenosine triphosphate that inhibits viral RNA polymerases)[43]. Remdesivir has broad-spectrum activity against members of several virus families, including filoviruses (e.g., Ebola and Marburg virus infection) and coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV] and has shown prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in nonclinical models of these coronaviruses.",

The nucleotide analog, once phosphorylated, works as antimetabolite, being incorporated into growing DNA strands, acting as chain terminator and stops viral DNA.

It should be noted that vaporisation particles have a diameter greater than 8 microns impacting the oropharynx, while aerosol particles, therefore capable of settling at the lower airway level, are between 0,5 and 5 microns in size. So if the hypothesis is to attack the virus in the oropharynx through the binding of SARS-COV-2 with the ACE2 receptor also present in this district, vaporization would be fine (both as suffumigation); but if we have to chase it into the lung, an aerosol is mandatory. Local instillation, vaporization or aerosolization of antivirals with WHV 40\u00b0-41\u00b0C can significantly decrease viral replication in hours or 2-3 days at most, in the early stages of respiratory disease (preclinical and phenotype I Straw I[29*], (Box 1).

            "text": "\nBox 3. Warning.It\u2019s important to observe that:Public health measures \u2013 the so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) \u2013 aimed at reducing contact rates in the population, and thereby reducing virus transmission, could be oriented to: a) mitigation (focused on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread); or b) suppression (which aims to reverse epidemic growth, reducing case numbers to low levels and maintaining that situation indefinitely, until a vaccine becomes available)[47].Wearing personal protection devices, maintaining a high level of personal/hands hygiene.Smoking is the most important cause of bronchospasm and bronchial epithelial vasoconstriction. All smokers should be advised to avoid smoking in this situation (unfortunately this is an immediate subjective behaviour for cough and dyspnoea in phenotype I, but to be evaluated in the pre-clinical phase or of suspected or documented infection by swab, even in asymptomatic patient).Vasoconstriction \u2013 as for cold \u2013 may significantly impair the reaction to a virus; mostly in polluted environment.To use alcoholic/Pi gargle in pre-clinical subjective oropharyngeal symptoms could act as a protection against progression to tracheal-bronchial involvement.To use hot humid aerosol could improve pre-clinical subjective symptoms.Aerosol could act as a vector for local pharmaceutical supply.Ingestion of nebulized drug and probiotics can positively interfere with intestinal-pulmonary cross-talk.At present, there is no drug approved for treating CoV-19 flu, although trials are testing promising compounds; the only therapeutic remedies are those aimed at the side effects caused by the virus, such as inflammation, arterial blood gas hypoxia, myocardial involvement[12], [13] and ARDS till the pulmonary fibrosis, up to now recognized as the first cause of death[48] .The anatomo-pathological finding of cardio-pulmonary microvascularheavy pathology[12], [13], causing deathin 69,44% between older patients withprevious cardiovascular disease (CVD) and increased troponin T (TnT), higher D\u2010dimer and fibrindegradation product (FDP) levels,longer prothrombin time and activatedpartial thromboplastin time in 71,4% of non\u2010survivors in the overallmortality of 11.5%, met the Sofacriteria of Disseminated IntravascularCoagulation (DIC)[49]. That means thatanother cause of death must take inaccount as viral consequence, mainlyin phenotype IV-V, that wouldimpose to add to ventilation, antiviraland IL-storm blocker, the properanticoagulant therapies.Inhaling a mixture of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, seems obtaining better results than with oxygen alone. It was also noted that individuals vaccinated for viral and/or bacterial infectious diseases were less likely to become infected. The germicidal UV radiation \u201cbreaks down\u201d the oxygen O2 which then aggregate into O3 molecules creating an ozone layer, capable of inhibiting viral replication and improving lung respiration. New anti-viral therapies with new drugs should also be take into consideration. For example, microbes are known to bind TLR, inducing IL-1, a pleiotropic cytokine, highly inflammatory, mediator of fever and fibrosis. Therefore, drugs that suppress IL-1 or IL-1R, also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are to be taken into consideration to fighting COVID-19[48] .Low-cost measures like nasal medicated hot vaporisation in preclinical swab-positive asymptomatic patient or in phenotypeI, and medicated aerosol in phenotypes II could be suggested, complementary to systemic therapy.In hospitalized phenotypes III-V aerosol in oxygen breathing mask with nucleotide analog or IL-6 blocker (acting on the interrelationship between inflammatory cytokines[50]) could be add to systemic and resuscitation therapies.Looking for a vaccine, the actual target is to avoid the viral adhesion to ACE2 pulmonary cells receptor where the pro-inflammatory cascade.[48] induces the alveolar edema, inhibit the O2/blood exchange and can evolve in interstitial fibrosis, with microvascular and myocardial involvement. The severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the immune system which, if weak, cannot stem the infection and its symptoms. A strategy to enhance the anti-inflammatory cytokines or suppress IL-1 or IL-1R, as suggested by Conti et al.[11], would be effective.Blocking the IL-6 pro-inflammatorycascade with Tocilizumab\u00ae via aerosol may also be tested, having clear in mind the previous weak recommendation for \u03b1-interferon, as quoted in text.\nRemdesivir\u00ae is a promising drug to act against CoV-1\n",
