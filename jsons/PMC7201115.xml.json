Essential functions of HVAC system includes heating (adding heat to raise or maintain temperature), cooling (removing heat to lower or maintain temperature), humidifying (adding water vapour), dehumidifying (removing water vapour) in order to maintain the moisture content of the air, filtering (removing dust particles, biological contaminants like bacteria, viruses and fungi), ventilating (air change rates between outdoor) and air distribution (velocity, flow pattern, direction of movement and distribution patterns) [1, 3]. These functions result in air conditioning, which aid in the prevention of contamination and cross-contamination and environmental protection along with operator protection [1, 2]. Maintaining good indoor air quality (IAQ) is an important non-pharmacological strategy in preventing hospital-acquired infections [4].",

Later on, such aerial dissemination of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species was proven by Das et al. from the movement of heavily contaminated bed curtains in the hospital [21]. Similarly, Clostridium difficile spores were recovered from air vents in a 22-month surveillance study suggesting aerial spread of infections [22].

Once bacteria, moulds or allergens enter a building, air handling systems (HVAC) control their spread, aid in their removal from the system in both droplet-borne (pertussis, influenza, coronavirus, Staphylococcus aureus) and airborne diseases (tuberculosis, Aspergillus, norovirus, varicella zoster virus) [16, 29\u201331]. This is achieved either by \u2018diluting\u2019 the pathogen (dilution ventilation) or by removing the pathogen (exhaust ventilation) [3, 16, 30, 32, 33]. An improperly maintained HVAC system can be a continuing source of contamination, an example of which is the growth of moulds and other fungi in damp and wet surfaces such as cooling coils, humidifiers, condensate pans and filters [17\u201323]. Poorly designed and maintained HVAC systems in the ICU can lead to \u2018sick building syndrome\u2019 (SBS), characterized by suffocation which can lead to decreased staff performance in addition to various hospital-acquired infections and occupational hazards [34].",

Three main characteristics of filters are the efficiency in removing various sized particles in air, create resistance to flow and their dust holding capacity [3]. Filters are rated based on their Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) rating. This ranges from 1 to 20 with higher values suggesting better filter efficiency. MERV 10 will be able to filter 1\u20133 \u03bcm size, whereas MERV > 13 will be able to filter particles of 0.3 to 1 \u03bcm. Medical facilities usually require MERV 14 to 16. Those filters with MERV \u2265 17 are called high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters [3]. HEPA filters with MERV 17 rating have an efficiency of 99.97% against 0.3 \u03bcm size particles. For clean rooms like body implants manufacturing site, MERV should be 20 (filtration efficiency of 99.999%). Usually, in an AHU, there will be a pre-filter with low to medium efficiency acting as \u2018roughing filter\u2019 removing large particulate matter and many microbes (MERV \u2264 4). They are called \u2018general filters\u2019 graded from G1 to G4 [10]. They have efficiency up to 70% down to 10 \u03bcm sized particle. Their role is very good in arrestance, ability to arrest larger particles like dirt, lint, hair and dust. Following filtration by pre-filter, air subsequently has to pass through an additional filter bank (second bank filter) with 99% efficiency for particles up to 5 \u03bcm, with pressure drop not exceeding 20 mm water gauge (WG). These are called as \u2018fine filters\u2019 graded from F5 to F9 [10]. Following this, air is passed through HEPA with 99.97% efficiency removing particles of 0.3 \u03bcm diameters and delivered to each zone of the building (Fig. 1a, b). The pressure drop at this stage should not exceed 50 mm WG. For particles sized 0.3 \u03bcm, pre-filters have 30\u201335% efficiency, whereas post-filters (final filters: HEPA) have 99.97% efficiency. Inline disposable pre-filters are used to increase the life of the HEPA filter. This concept of progressive filtration increases the life of HEPA filters [3]. During outbreaks, the concentration of airborne Aspergillus conidia in patient care areas can be up to 100 conidia/m3 (CFU/m3), whereas in rooms with HEPA, filtration the counts below 0.1 CFU/m3 were reported [35]. Guidelines for infection control in health care facilities show that the filtration system with HEPA filters is adequate for most patient care areas [36]. These filters are at least efficient for removing particles sized more than 0.3 \u03bcm in diameter [3].",

CDC recommends to isolate patients with suspected COVID-19 in airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) with a minimum ACR of 6 per hour (12 ACR for new construction or renovation), along with the use of HEPA filtration of the incoming air, if re-circulated [47]. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends COVID-19 patients to be isolated in an adequately ventilated negative pressure rooms with a minimum of 12 ACH, especially if aerosol-generating procedures are planned [48, 49]. Similar recommendations are proposed by Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines released by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) [50]. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control remains silent on the above aspects but gives importance to frequent cleaning and maintenance of HVAC systems [51].\n",
