            "text": "Efficient growth of young dairy calves is important to profitability of the dairy enterprise. Before weaning, intake of nutrients from liquid feeds is usually limited to stimulate early dry feed intake and allow development of ruminal function and early weaning (Bush and Nicholson, 1986). Effects of feeding additional liquid milk or milk replacer to calves have been evaluated. Generally, increased intake of nutrients consumed in liquid causes less starter and forage intake (Jasper and Weary, 2002), increased BW gain (Brown et al., 2005), and greater deposition of fat and protein (Diaz et al., 2001).",

There was no difference among treatments (P = 0.21) over the entire 56-d study (Table 3\n); however, preweaning mortality tended (P\n < 0.10) to be greater in calves fed additional CMR (VAR and GAM) compared with CON. Addition of the dietary supplement had no effect on preweaning or total mortality. Fourteen calves fed additional CMR died at an average of 12.6 d; and 3 calves on CON treatment died at an average of 14.0 d. Because calves were of varying ages and backgrounds prior to arrival at the research facility, it is possible that previous pathogenic exposure was responsible for observed mortality, particularly in the first week. Therefore, it is difficult to determine precisely the contribution to mortality from previous pathogen exposure and that caused by imposition of dietary treatments. We concluded that after 3 d of the study, it was likely that dietary treatments (particularly intake of energy and protein from CMR) would affect clinical outcome. Of calves fed additional CMR, 1, 10, and 2 calves died during wk 1, 2, and 4, respectively. Of calves fed CON, 2 and 1 calves died during wk 1 and 5, respectively. The second week of the study was the week of highest fecal scores and greatest number of veterinary treatments for both groups of calves. The increase in amount of CMR offered to calves fed additional CMR from 454 to 681 g/d on d 8 constituted a 50% increase in feeding rate at the time when calves were dealing with enteric challenges. It is possible that the abrupt change in feeding rate may have contributed to increased morbidity and mortality; however, further research is needed to confirm this observation.",

Fecal scores, days with scours, proportion of calves treated with antibiotics, and number of days calves were treated with antibiotics were greater when additional CMR was fed. Moreover, the number of days that calves were treated with electrolytes tended (P\n < 0.11) to be greater when calves were fed additional CMR. That antibiotic therapy was greater in calves fed additional CMR was of interest because therapy was initiated only when calves had a rectal temperature > 39.4\u00b0 C. Rectal temperatures were measured when calves had clinical signs of disease (anorexia, diarrhea, etc.). It is possible that calves on CON treatment also had elevated rectal temperatures but fewer clinical signs of disease (e.g., diarrhea) than calves fed additional CMR. However, there was no difference in the percentage of calves that exhibited one or more days with fever or number of days that calves had fever (Table 3). Feeding additional CMR may increase fecal scores in preweaned calves, particularly within the first 2 wk (Diaz et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2005), and increased days treated for illness (Ballard et al., 2004). Conversely, Jasper and Weary (2002) reported no significant effect of CMR feeding method on fecal scores when whole milk was fed to calves. Foote et al. (2004) reported little effect of feeding 1.14 kg/d of CMR (28% CP, 20% fat) compared with calves fed 0.57 kg/d of CMR (22% CP, 20% fat) on antigen-specific responses of vaccinated dairy calves, suggesting that amount of CMR feeding may have limited influence on immune response.",

Plasma urea N concentration in calves fed additional CMR on d 7 was 5.9 mmol/L, which suggests that a portion of the added CP in the CMR consumed by calves was used for energy with subsequent deamination and increased urea N concentration. Calves on all treatments also lost BW during the first 7 d of the study.

Although we recorded temporal changes in TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in blood, these changes were unrelated to dietary treatment. In addition, we estimated anorexia by determining the proportion of calves that refused any part of a CMR feeding and the number of CMR refusals, recognizing that the number of opportunities for calves to refuse CMR was greater in calves fed VAR and GAM, because they were weaned 14 d later than calves fed CON. There were no differences in proportion of calves refusing CMR or in the number of refusals recorded. Additionally, there were no effects of feeding regimen on concentrations of plasma TNF-\u03b1 , suggesting that feeding method per se had no effect on anorexia or the calf's ability to use ingested nutrients. Increased growth rates were consistent with increased intake of nutrients. However, when conducted under the conditions of this study, feeding additional CMR increased incidence of disease and caused a trend for greater pre-weaning mortality in calves fed additional CMR.
