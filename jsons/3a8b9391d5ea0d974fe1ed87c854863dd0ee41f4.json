In chronic hepatitis B patients treated with PEG-IFN several retrospective analyses of IL28B rs12980275 and rs12979860 genotypes yielded conflicting results which can be explained by the heterogeneity between the study populations.

In contrast, so far identified genetic factors play only a minor role in chronic hepatitis B infection. Over the past years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allowed to study the associations between mapped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the presence of common complex conditions in large patient cohorts, thereby revolutionising the study of many traits and diseases. 1 An important yield of genome-wide association studies is information about the role of specific proteins and biological pathways in pathogenesis; these proteins and pathways are candidate targets for the development of preventive and therapeutic methods for disease management. 2 Several GWAS in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with pegylated interferon-a (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV) lead to a better understanding of the effects of interferon and of ribavirin (RBV)-induced anaemia. A GWAS investigating the response pattern to PEG/RBV in genotype (GT) 1 in a randomised-controlled prospective study (IDEAL study 3 ) identified a SNP in rs12979860, 3 kilobases upstream of the IL28B (interleukin 28B) region, strongly associated with treatment outcome. 4 Patients homozygous for the beneficial C allele had a two-to three-fold higher chance to eradicate the virus under treatment with PEG/RBV than patients carrying the T allele. These data were confirmed by further studies. [5] [6] [7] Different GWAS identified additional SNPs (rs8099917 and rs12980275) [8] [9] [10] in vicinity of the IL28B gene with a strong association with nonresponse to treatment in GT 1. A further GWAS of the IDEAL study demonstrated SNPs genetic variants on chromosome 20 in the rs6051702 region (major allele A) with two functional variants (rs1127354 and rs7270101) which both protect against RBV-reduced anaemia. Similar data were obtained in Japanese patients. 11 ",

            "text": "Spontaneous viral clearance In 2009, the IL28B SNP rs12979860 was identified to be strongly associated with spontaneous viral clearance in acute hepatitis C (AHC). 12 Furthermore, another study showed that IL28B CC genotype was associated with jaundice and spontaneous resolution of the virus. 13 These data were confirmed by Beinhardt et al. and were extended to the observation that serum levels of IP-10 (interferon-c inducible protein-10) increased the predictive value of IL28B polymorphism for spontaneous clearance in AHC. 14 Recently Duggal et al. described the association of SNP in rs4273729 localised near the HLA class II genes on Chromosome 6 with spontaneous reso-lution of HCV infection independently of IL28B. SNPs IL28B and DQB1*03:01 (HLA class II) may explain approximately 15% of spontaneous resolution. 15 In the same line, G allele of the tapasin gene (an important component of the peptide loading complex for HLA class I) was significantly associated with the outcome of HCV infection. 16 Response to anti-viral therapy At present all effective treatment of genotype (GT) 1 chronic hepatitis C include PEG/RBV. For GT1-infected patients, they were used to be combined with the first generation protease inhibitors telaprevir (TPV) or boceprevir (BOC). Within the last months, two new compounds were approved in the USA and Canada [the NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF) and the 'second wave' protease inhibitor simeprevir (SMV)]. In Europe only Sofosbuvir was approved so far. These DAAs in combination with PEG/RBV will replace BOC and TPV within the foreseeable future in GT1 chronic hepatitis C. Furthermore, SOF was approved for an all-oral regimen with RBV for GT2 and 3.",

            "text": "IL28B resides on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.13) and encodes for interferon (IFN)-k3. IFN-k3 belongs, together with IL28A (IFN-k2) and IL29 (IFN-k1), to the family of type III interferons and was first described in 2003. 17 Several viral infections are able to induce the expression of IFN-k subtypes, and subsequently agonists of toll-like receptors induce type III IFNs. 18, 19 The expression of type I (IFN-a and -b) and III IFNs is induced by the same agents and regulated by common mechanisms. 20 IFN-ks signal through a unique janus-kinases/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) with common downstream signalling system with the type I IFNs. 10, 21 The molecular mechanism, how IL28B genotype influences the response to anti-viral treatment remains unclear. One possible explanation might be elevated levels of interferon stimulated genes (ISG) in patients with the unfavourable T allele compared to CC carriers. 22, 23 IL28B genotype might be associated with a specific cell-type modulation of ISG expression (MxA, PKR, OAS1, ISG15) in hepato-cytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 24 Furthermore, a recently published article discovered a dinucleotide variant in ss469415590 (TT or DG), that is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860, 25, 26 Ss469415590 (DG) associated with rs12979860 T allele is a frameshift variant that creates a novel gene IFNL4, encoding for IFN-k4 another member of the type III IFN-family sharing a 40.8% amino sequence similarity with IFN-k3. The insertion ss469415590 (TT) in IL28B CC patients leads to an abrogation of IFN-k4. In treatment-resistant IL28B genotype patients, immune cell infiltration of the liver was impaired and hepatic ISGs were up-regulated mediated by multiple factors, including IL28A/B, IFN-k4 and WNT5A (wingless-related MMTV integration site 5A). 27 Moreover, IFNL4 induces expression of ISG in HepG2 hepatoma cells, which might explain lower response rates in patients with the DG genotype. By contrast, a study by Hamming et al. identified a potent anti-viral effect of IFN-k4 against both HCV and coronaviruses. 28 IFNL4 is strongly associated with SVR in both GT1 and 4, but not in GT2 and 3. Thus, due to its strong correlation with rs12979860 in IL28B, it provides no additional information for treatment prediction at least in Caucasian patients. In contrast, IFNL4 is only moderately correlated with SNP rs8099917 in Caucasian patients and determination of IFNL4 in the clinical setting is therefore superior. 29, 30 The difference between the two commonly used IL28B polymorphisms may be due to their different distances from ss469415590. IL28B rs12979860 resides 3 kb upstream of IFNL3 within intron 1 of IFNL4 whereas rs8099917 lies 9 kb upstream of IFNL3 and hence outside of IFNL4. 31 In African population, IFNL4 showed only a weak correlation with rs8099917 and a moderate correlation with rs12979860. With this respect, determination of IFNL4 genotype in patients with African ancestry might be superior to determination of SNPs in IL28B.",

In 2011, two direct acting anti-virals (DAA)boceprevir (BOC) and telaprevir (TPV)were approved for the treatment of HCV GT1 chronic infection and opened a new era in the field of CHC therapy. 32 Anti-viral triple therapy raised overall SVR rates in previously untreated patients from 40-45% to 68-79%. 33, 34 A retrospective analysis 35 from the SPRINT-2 study focused on the relationship between IL28B polymorphism and treatment outcome of triple therapy with BOC in treatment-na\u20ac \u0131ve patients. High and equivalent SVR rates were observed in CC patients in both -BOC and PEG/RBVtreatment arms. CC patients were more likely to be eligible for shorter treatment duration than patients with T allele (89% vs. 52%). Ninety-seven per cent of patients with CC achieved a \u22651 log 10 -drop in HCV-RNA at the end of the 4-week lead-in phase with PEG/RBV, which identifies good responders with high SVR rates and low risk of selection of resistant HCV-variants to BOC. BOC therapy was associated with high SVR improvement in non-CC patients: 55-71% in the BOC arm compared to 27-28% in the PEG/RBV control arm. Overall, logistic regression modelling found the IL28B genotype independently associated with SVR in BOC-based therapy, but the effect was attenuated in comparison to PEG/RBV alone. Regardless of the IL28B genotype week 4 log 10drop was the strongest on-treatment predictor of response.",

Thus, pre-treatment determination of IL28B might still have its usefulness, although its effect on treatment response might be attenuated in highly active anti-viral regimes combining two or three different DAA classes. Still, patients carrying the beneficial genotype might benefit from shorter treatment durations. Furthermore, it has to be pointed out that IFN-free treatment regimes will not be affordable in many parts of the world in the near future. It is to be expected that in developing countries and even in most countries of Eastern Europe IFN and RBV will be the backbone of anti-viral treatment for chronic hepatitis C for the next years. The determination of IL28B might have its value in individualising therapy to optimise cost effectiveness and furthermore spare side effects. 55 Thus, further prospective studies are in need to evaluate the impact of IL28B on treatment success in IFN-free treatments. Establishing predictive factors may allow shortening treatment further allowing reducing the cost of the new anti-viral treatment.

            "text": "Adiponutrin or patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) is a member of the patatin-like phospholipase family. It is expressed in several human tissues with highest expression in the liver. 59, 60 The in vivo function of PNPLA3 in human is widely unknown. In vitro studies in Sf9 cells have shown that PNPLA3 is able to both synthesise and hydrolyse triglycerides. PNPLA3 acts as a transacylase, which synthesises intracellular triglycerides by transferring acyl groups from monoglycerides to mono-and diglycerides. 61 In 2008, a GWAS identified a SNP in rs738409 in the PNPLA3 gene to be associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. 62 The G allele variation, leading to an isoleucin to methionine exchange in amino acid 148 (I148M) of the protein, led to higher liver fat content independent of body mass index, diabetes status, alcohol consumption and ancestry. Furthermore, PNPLA3 was associated with alcoholic liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis, 63 as well as with HCC in alcoholic cirrhosis. 64 A different study confirmed these observations, but on the other hand it found only a weak association between PNPLA3 and HCC in cirrhotic CHC patients. 65, 66 In Caucasian CHC patients, a study by Trepo et al. found a strong and independent association between PNPLA3 and liver damage. 67 Patients with homozygosity of the risk allele had a 2.5-fold higher risk for hepatic steatosis and an over three-fold higher risk for fibrosis as well as for fibrosis progression. In contrast, no impact on treatment response to PEG/RBV could be observed. In a different study, the effect of PNPLA3 on steatosis and fibrosis was missing in GT 3, suggesting distinct pathogenetic mechanisms in GT 3 and GT 1 CHC patients. 68 In GT 3 infection, the viral mechanisms of fat accumulation are probably stronger than the host factors.",

            "text": "The pathomechanisms of HBV infection are complex. 92 HBV-related liver disease is generally thought to be related to cytotoxic T cell-mediated lysis of infected hepatocytes but complete virus elimination does not occur. 93 The HBV genome replicates by reverse transcription via an RNA intermediate, the pre-genomic RNA. Nucleocapsids with the partially double stranded HBV-DNA can reenter the hepatocyte nucleus to produce cccDNA or be secreted as complete virions after coating with envelope proteins. The cccDNA has a long half-life and is very resistant to anti-viral therapy, accounting for the difficulty in achieving virus clearance during treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Thus, understanding the mode of action of anti-viral treatments and the study of genetic factors modifying treatment outcome is not fully understood. Currently, treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is aimed to improve survival by long-term suppression of HBV replication to prevent long-term consequences like liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PEG-IFN or nucleos(t)id analogues (NUC) are the first line treatments for patients with chronic hepatitis B. 94 Limited duration of treatment, induction of a sustained off-treatment response due to enhancement of the host 0 s immune response and absence of resistance are advantages of IFN treatment. However, this can be accomplished only in a proportion of CHB patients and in contrast to NUCs interferon treatment is compromised by adverse effects and the uncertainty whether an individual patient will achieve a durable response. Therefore, it is of particular interest to identify factors which are associated with response to PEG-IFN treatment. Age, gender, HBV genotype, baseline ALT levels, interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 and pre-treatment viral load have been identified as pre-treatment predictors. [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] However, these factors do not explain the differences in response to IFN treatment to the whole extent and viral load and transaminases frequently show a fluctuating course during natural history of the disease. Thus, identification of host genetic factors modulating treatment outcome may improve the use of PEG-IFN in clinical practice by selecting patients with the highest probabilities of response. Due to difficult treatment endpoints, different phases of disease during HBV infection, heterogeneity of the treatment population data on genetics and HBV infection are inconsistent to some extent.",

            "text": "IL28B and IFN treatment of chronic hepatitis B Based on the impact of IL28B polymorphism on the effects of interferon in patients with chronic hepatitis C there was a substantial hope that these effects also might play a role in patients with CHB treated with PEG-IFN. Several retrospective analyses of IL28B rs12980275 and rs12979860 genotypes in chronic hepatitis B patients treated with PEG-IFN yielded conflicting results. Some studies identified that the favourable genotype predicts higher on-treatment and off-treatment virological and serological response both in HBeAg-negative and -positive patients. [100] [101] [102] [103] In contrast, other studies did not find significant differences in outcome between variant host genotypes. [104] [105] [106] [107] In a study investigating 205 HBeAg-positive Asian and European CHB patients treated with PEG-IFN with or without lamivudine or standard IFN, HBeAg seroconversion rates at the end of treatment were higher among homozygotes for the favourable IL28B genotypes (rs12980275 AA: 51% vs. AG: 26% vs. GG: 10%, P < 0.001; rs12979860 CC: 50% vs. CT: 29% vs. TT: 10%, P = 0.001). 99 The patients were predominantly male and were chronically infected with HBV genotype C (47%). Importantly, this association of IL28B genotype with increased probability of HBeAg seroconversion was apparent at the end of PEG-IFN treatment and during the post-treatment period. In the 182 patients (89%) receiving no LAM or LAM for up to 52 weeks, the beneficial IL28B genotypes were also independently associated with an increased probability of HBeAg clearance at 6 months post-treatment [OR for AA vs. AG/GG, 3.54 (95% CI: 1.33-9.41; P = 0.008); OR for CC vs. CT/TT, 3.24 (95% CI, 1.21-8.69; P = 0.016)] also after adjusting for age, HBV genotype, baseline HBV-DNA and ALT levels and previous interferon exposure. 99 IL28B genotype was also independently associated with an increased probability of HBeAg seroconversion through long-term follow-up. HBeAg seroconversion rates were 54%, 35% and 20% in patients with rs12980275 genotype AA, AG and GG (P = 0.005), respectively. In a Cox proportional hazards model, rs12980275 genotype AA was associated with a higher probability of HBeAg seroconversion after adjusting for HBV genotype and baseline HBV-DNA and ALT levels (hazard ratio 2.14; 95% CI 1.14-4.31; P = 0.018). Similar results were seen for rs12979860. A relationship between IL28B genotypes and combined HBeAg seroconversion and HBV-DNA response during long-term follow-up could not be determined. Moreover, after adjustment for HBV genotype A and ethnicity, rs12980275 AA genotype was associated with a higher probability of HBsAg clearance [n = 18 (9%)] after a median of 173 weeks follow-up [HR 3.47 for AA vs. AG/GG (95% CI: 1.04-13.48, P = 0.042); for CC vs. CT/TT 2.57 (95% CI, 0.78-9.08; P = 0.02)]. However, analysing HBeAg seroconversion rates separately according to HBV genotype revealed that HBeAg seroconversion rates were independent of the IL28B genotype in HBV genotype D patients.",

Also the overall long-term virological response, the percentage of patients reaching serum HBV-DNA level <2000 IU/mL 24 weeks after end of treatment or the rate of HBsAg after loss 33 months of follow-up in 36 HBeAg-negative patients was independent of the IL28B genotype.

            "text": "Taken together the data, in contrast to chronic hepatitis C IL28B genotypes seem to be of less importance in predicting responsiveness to the immunomodulatory effects of pegylated-IFN in chronic hepatitis B. However, in combination with other predictors of response (e.g. viral genotype, HBsAg decline) it can be a valuable additional tool to estimate the likelihood of response. To date, the limited utility of multiple SNPs polymorphisms for predicting interferon treatment outcome for CHB patients does not recommend its application or to define the pre-treatment probability of a response at an individual level. 94 HLA Some variants of the HLA-DP locus (HLA-DPA1 A allele and HLA-DPB1) protect against progression of CHB [108] [109] [110] and development of hepatocellular carcinoma, 111 at least in Asian patients. Furthermore, in Asian patients treated with PEG-IFN HLA-DPA1 genotype was associated with higher HBeAg seroconversion rates. 108, 112 HLA-DPB1 is a member of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are glycoproteins attached to the cell membrane of predominantly B-lymphocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages. It is currently not known whether these polymorphisms are also protective against HBV chronicity in Caucasian patients. In contrast to Caucasians, in Asian patients the A allele of HLA-DPB1 is the major and the G allele is the minor allele. These molecules are involved in antigen presentation to CD4 + helper T-lymphocytes, which, after recognition of the antigen presented, lead to an antibody response. 113 Further studies are needed to identify other genetic factors modulating treatment response and disease progression and development of hepatocellular carcinoma in CHB patients. Genome-wide association studies in large patient cohorts are ongoing currently. Some preliminary associations were reported already. 114 In conclusion, genetic factors have an important influence on the evolution and treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Most of these genetic polymorphisms have not entered the clinical practice yet but allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic HCV infection. Even in the era of the expected interferon/ ribavirin-free treatment options genetic factors may modify treatment responses and may allow an individualisation of the length treatment. In contrast, in chronic hepatitis B so far identified genetic factors play only a minor role.",
