All spike proteins of coronaviruses contain S1 subunit and S2 subunit, which were divided by the S cleavage sites.

To better understand the host selection of beta coronaviruses, the relationship of spike glycoprotein between SARS-CoV-2 and other closely related beta coronaviruses has been analyzed. The result showed that bat SARS-like CoV RaTG13, with 96.2% overall genome sequence identity, 18 is an inner joint neighbor of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 2 ). In October 2019, it was reported that Sendai virus and coronavirus were the dominant viruses in the virome data of Malayan pangolins. 19 It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV was the most widely distributed coronavirus in the pangolin samples. We blasted the SARS-CoV-2 reads and found that the spike protein sequence was present in pangolin SARS-like CoV (numbered SRR10168377 here). The S protein in pangolin SARS-like CoV SRR10168377 (marked as red star) possesses only 75% similarity with SARS-CoV-2, partly because there were more than 220 residues in the S2 subunit that had not been read in the virome data.",

Studying selective stress may be helpful for assessing the variability and potential for host changes of SARS-CoV-2. Based on a report, 20 the selective pressure analysis showed that genes (ORF10 and ORF7a) have a greater selective pressure, and Spike has an average pressure relative to the whole genome ( Figure S2 ). The spike RBD-receptor interaction is a key factor determining the host range of coronaviruses. The RBD sequences of spike protein from SARS-CoV, bat, or pangolin SARSlike CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were aligned ( Figure 3 ). There are some deletions from 473 to 490 residues in bat SARS-like CoV, which are located in the external subdomain, and it seems that these viruses do not infect humans naturally, given that there is no direct evidence showing that bat SARS-like CoV has ever infected humans. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence from 329 to 521 possesses 93% identity with pangolin SARS-like CoV SRR10168377, which has higher than 89% similarity with bat SARS-like CoV RaTG13 Residues K479 and S487 in civet SARS-CoV can effectively recognize civet ACE2, but bind with human ACE2 much less efficiently. 23 The residue Thr487 in RBD binds to Tyr41 and Lys353 in human ACE2 by van der Waals contacts, 25 (Table 1) . Mouse and dog also have multiple (\u22655) substitutions while cat and hamster only contain three mutations in the region. It was showed that Lys31, Tyr41, and Lys353 mutations substantially interfere with the S1-Ig association. 24 This study provides information and possibilities that like snakes and pangolins, turtles (C. picta bellii, C. mydas, and P. sinensis) may also act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to human, although much more needs to be confirmed.

In addition, 505 COVID-19 cases have now been transmitted across other 24 countries (http://2019ncov. chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/global.html), a part of them because of contact or residence history with Wuhan. Confirmation of intermediate hosts is essential to prevent further spread of the epidemic. This study focuses on comparisons of the spike sequences between SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoV, and other coronaviruses, which are helpful for evolutionary analysis and finding the possible virus reservoirs. In addition, analysis of the ACE2 structures and binding motif alignment facilitates obtaining clues to differentiate the potential hosts.",

The external subdomain in RBD has also been identified. The interaction model of SARS-CoV-2 with human ACE2 was then calculated by the PRISM 2.0 database (Figure 4B), which was generally similar to the structure of SARS-CoV S protein binding with human receptor ACE2 (Figure 4C). Based on our results and two recent reports, 21,22 we noticed that SARS-CoV-2 numbering S protein may bind to ACE2 through Leu455, Phe486, Gln493, Asn501, and Tyr505, only quartier is same as SARS-CoV.

The turtle receptor at position 31 contains glutamine or glutamic acid and mouse receptor contains asparagine; other observed species all contain lysine, same as humans. Substitution of His353 with Lys353 in mouse ACE2 allows SARS-CoV to infect murine cells, 14 indicating the importance of residue Lys353 binding with receptor. In addition, considering the function of position 41 in the interaction with receptor, tyrosine may possess higher affinity with Asn501 of RBD than histidine. From this perspective of Asn501 in RBD domain with the sites 41 and 353 of ACE2 receptor, it seems that turtles and pangolins are closer to humans than bat, indicating that turtles and pangolins may be the potential expanded hosts of SARS-CoV-2. The structural basis underlying this observed difference remains to be illustrated.4 | DISCUSSIONKnowing the structural binding mechanism will support finding the accurate virus reservoirs and facilitate prevention countermeasure development. The crystallization of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was urgently analyzed by cryoelectron microscopy; 13 it helps to verify the interfacing sites in the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and human ACE2 or other hosts' receptors.

From SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, all point to bats as the natural host of coronaviruses, but the intermediate hosts are all different. Previous findings suggested that the snake is a probable wildlife animal reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 based on its relative synonymous codon usage bias resembling snake compared with other animals. 31 Civets and dromedary, as the intermediate hosts of zoonotic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, live in different time and space environments. They nevertheless transmitted the coronaviruses to humans, which makes it difficult to find the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 in the short term. Analysis of the viral receptor-binding sequences and host receptors helps to quickly target the possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
