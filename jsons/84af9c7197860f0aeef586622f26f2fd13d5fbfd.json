Since Nov 2019 the outbreak in China, the virus is spreading 11 exponentially everywhere. The current study focuses on the relationship between 12 environmental parameters and the growth rate of COVID-19. The statistical analysis suggests 13 that the temperature changes retarded the growth rate and found that -6.28 o C and +14.51 o C 14 temperature is the favorable range for COVID-19 growth. Gutenberg-Richter's relationship 15 is used to estimate the mean daily rate of exceedance of confirmed cases concerning the 16 change in temperature. Temperature is the most influential parameter that reduces the growth 17 at the rate of 13-16 cases/day with a 1 o C rise in temperature.",

It is reported 33 (Li et al. 2020) that SARS-Cov-2 has a reproductive number (R 0 ) of 2.2 indicating that a 34 patient on average spreads the virus to 2.2 people around him. The study also suggests that 35 the average incubation period is around 5.2 days, with influenza doubled in size for every 7.4 36 days as the host transmits to close contacts before exhiniting symptoms (within 14 days), 37 leading to an exponential chain transmission.
