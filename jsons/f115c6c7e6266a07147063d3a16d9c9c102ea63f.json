Because they did not have access to actual COVID-19 samples, Song et al. used samples of healthy nasal mucosa spiked with inactivated HIV particles and other pathogens as their test materials. The Penn-RAMP process provided greater sensitivity than RT-PCR or LAMP alone. When using limited viral load, Penn-RAMP provided 100 times better sensitivity than a single LAMP test. Compared to a LAMP assay, which requires sophisticated equipment and must be run at a fixed temperature, the Penn-RAMP process requires less energy cost, is easier to execute, and can be completed in clinical or home settings.",

We have previously developed a paper-based platform for fluorescent nucleic acid screening using nucleic ladders. This research provided considerable insight into fluorescent probe selection and viral detection and required only a small sample volume. The potential rapid and easy-to-use paper-based LAMP assay for COVID-19 could be used in combination with a smartphone application to facilitate test results recording/sharing. Using this tool, a home-quarantined individual could easily self-collect a nasal swab sample; perform a LAMP assay; and observe a visible, colorimetric test result that could then be recorded and shared with clinicians or healthcare professionals via the internet.",
