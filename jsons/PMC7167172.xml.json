Very recently, a map of dengue risk on the basis of the global population in 2010 estimated 390 million infections worldwide, of which 96 millions manifested apparently [Bhatt et al., 2013]. This estimate is more than three times higher the WHO predicted burden. In particular, Brazil has reported the largest number of dengue cases, accounting for more than 70% in the Americas. However, reliable biomarkers of dengue severity, specific antiviral therapy and a licensed antidengue vaccine are not available [World Health Organization, 2009; Guzman et al., 2010; Simmons et al., 2012].",

For the first time, these apoptotic proteins were measured in patients with the WHO classification for dengue revised in 2009. The three plasma molecules evaluated (FasL, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and TRAIL) are fundamental apoptosis inducers. The other proteins studied, plasma Survivin and PBMCs lysate proteins, are IAPs. Our data suggest that TRAIL could be involved with apoptosis induction of blood lymphocytes and could also contribute to the antiviral response. Conversely, IAPs may participate in apoptosis protection of blood leukocytes. FasL may display a role in dengue pathophysiology, and especially in fatal cases of dengue.",

The TRAIL hypothesis, that TRAIL antiviral action is not direct, in dengue infection is supported by recent findings of Shrestha et al. [2012]. These authors demonstrated that TRAIL secreted by CD8+ T cells provides antiviral signals to neurons infected by West Nile virus (a flavivirus closely related to DENV). The effect was studied in the central nervous system of a mouse model and in primary culture of mouse cortical neurons. This work suggests that TRAIL produced by CD8+ T cells is necessary but not sufficient to confer an antiviral effect, and that such an effect requires additional secreted cytokines and/or cytolytic activities by the CD8+ T cells.",
