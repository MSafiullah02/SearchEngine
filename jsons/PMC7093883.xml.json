The clinical manifestations of MERS are principally respiratory. The symptoms are nonspecific, including fever, chills, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea. Clinical worsening over a few days leads to respiratory failure with diffuse rales and radiographic abnormalities similar to other viral pneumonias and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients also manifest tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. Patients often develop acute renal failure and gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain. The main mode of transmission remains unknown, although it appears to be via large droplets of respiratory secretions and direct contact, although airborne transmission may also play a role.",

Similarly, the absence of infection in the intestines contrasts with the rare detection of viral RNA in stool and suggests that nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which occur not infrequently in patients with MERS, are unlikely to be caused by viral infection of the gastrointestinal tract.5\n",

This model represents severe human disease and pathologic lesions, and it likely differs from human infection in the high dose of inoculum, short incubation period and course, evidence for widely disseminated infection, and infection of predominantly type 1 pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. A subsequent study of MERS-CoV infection in common marmosets found sublethal mild-to-moderate respiratory disease with no recovery of infectious virus or detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR or viral antigens by immunohistochemistry, modest radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease, and multifocal interstitial pneumonia with few syncytial cells.10 Both studies found clinical respiratory disease, although differing in severity of illness and virologic results.

Our potential loss of knowledge includes loss of the opportunity to evaluate the effects of new treatments and the correlations with new imaging tools. An even greater lost opportunity is the inadequate use of autopsies as prospective research tools. The decline in performance of autopsies has resulted in the erosion of expertise of many pathologists whose sporadic assignment to cover an autopsy falls outside their areas of expertise, which is often the surgical pathologic diagnoses of a single organ rather than the comprehensive analysis of the pathophysiologic and morphologic changes in all of the organ systems accrued over a lifetime. The consideration of further reduction in the autopsy requirement for training pathology residents may portend further retreat from the potential gains in knowledge that well-performed postmortem examinations can provide.",
