Sulphur stress has shown deleterious effect on the growth of cyanobacteria [1, 2]. Adenosyl homocysteinase (AHc) is also known as S-Adenosyl homocysteinase hydrolase; this is an enzyme that hydrolyses to adenosine and l-homocysteinase [2, 3]. Adenosyl homocysteinase plays a major role in regulating methylation and controlling its intracellular concentration. It acts as a catalyst in a chemical reaction by regulating the levels of S-Adenosylhomocysteine. S-Adenosylhomocysteine is very important for transmethylation reaction. According to studies [4\u20136], AHc can act as anticryptosporidial drug, antiviral, antitumor, antioxidant and antimalarial agents.",

A wound can be an injury in any normal tissue by physical, thermal, chemical or microbial effects that results in damaging tissues at molecular and cellular levels. Wound healing is a vital biochemical and physiological process that can be challenged due to free radicals. The process of wound healing takes place in three successive phases such as inflammation phase, tissue formation phase and remodelling phase [5]. Proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors are secreted by white blood cells during inflammation. It is followed by strengthening of new granulation tissue by laying collagen in the wound by fibroblasts. In the third phase, the new cells are formed around the wound and new matrix is created which reduces the extracellular matrix and its component [6].",

At the site of injury, excess amount of protease and reactive oxygen species are formed by the accumulation of neutrophils and it restricts the oxidative damage of protease inhibitor [7]. Reactive oxygen species is developed at the wound site in larger quantities as a protection against invasive bacteria. The existence of increased number of neutrophils and ROS, nevertheless, overwhelms the antiprotease substances that usually shield the cells and extracellular matrix. Reactive oxygen species can cause severe tissue damage at high concentrations and even contribute to neoplastic transformation, which inhibits the healing process through disruption of cell membranes, DNA, proteins and lipids. Fibroblasts can be killed and excess ROS make skin lipids less flexible. As a consequence, the ultimate involvement of antioxidants in the successful treatment and maintenance of wound tends to be important. Such adverse effects of wounds are minimized due to antioxidants by eliminating inflammatory compounds. They counteract the excess proteases and ROS which are often produced due to the accumulation of neutrophils in the injury [6, 7]. Antioxidant protection is a mechanism that includes the interaction between the compound and the hydroxyl peroxidase rather than just limiting the cell membrane damage [8]. Many compounds have been reported to show wound healing activity with the property of high radical scavenging capacity [6].",

Spirulina has shown to increase the activation of macrophages and reduction of inflammation without effecting innate defense system [9]. Abdel-Daim et al. reported that the inflammation improved various oxidative stress markers including nitric oxide, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione in mice model [10]. Spirulina has bioactive compounds that help in the inactivation of free radicals protecting against stress [11\u201313]. Cyanobacterial metabolites reveal interesting and exciting bioactivities such as anticoagulant, immunosuppressant, antimalarial, antiviral and antibacterial [14].

Further, the expression pattern of ApAHc was analysed in real time PCR in A. platensis cells which was cultured under the sulphur deprived condition. A short peptide named NL13 was derived from S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase domain of ApAHc protein by bioinformatics analysis and it was synthesised to study its activities. NL13 peptide was predicted to have antioxidant property based on the conserved regions compared to the other known antioxidant cyanobacteria using BLAST. Also, other parameters like molecular weight (1.33 kDa) and the presence of antioxidant amino acids such as Proline (7.7%), Leucine (15.4%), Alanine (15.38%), Valine (7.7%) and Aspartic acid (15.4%) [18, 19]. The purity of the peptide was determined using HPLC and its sequence purity was confirmed by MS analysis. Further, the peptide was subjected to the determination of different physical and chemical properties using in silico tools. NL13 was also further subjected to various molecular assays including cytotoxicity and wound healing performance on VERO fibroblast cells under H2O2 stress to study its antioxidant potent.",

PepCal and Peptide 2.0 (www.peptide2.com) were anticipated to use MEGA X (www.megasoftware.net) for phylogenetic analysis. Amino acid sequences were aligned using EMBL-EBL (www.ebi.ac.uk) and 3D structure was built using the I-TASSER (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/). PyMOL (www.pymol.org) is used to render 3D models. The anticipated 3D structure was projected to be accurate based on I-TASSER confidence score (C-) and RMSD (Ramachandran Plot Analysis). Prabi-Gerland web server (www.prabi.fr) was conducted for additional details on 2D structure.",

The physio-chemical properties of ApAHc were determined by DNAssist software (ver. 2.2). The obtained results data signified that ApAHc has a coding region of 1281 base pairs, that encodes a protein of 426 amino acids capable of 46.509 k Da as molecular weight and 5.53 as isoelectric point (pI). The amino acids consist of three domains namely S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase coenzymes transport metabolism as the biggest domain (9Lys\u2013Thr425), S-adenosyl-l-homocysteinehydrolase (10Tyr\u2013Thr425) and S-Adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase NAD-binding site catalytic domain (19Pro\u2013Trp421) with four different motifs which forms the NAD binding site, ligand binding site, polypeptide binding site and catalytic site (Data shown in E-Suppl. File Fig. 1). S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase forms the biggest domain (9Lys-Thr425) in ApAHc that is a potent inhibitor of S-adenosyl-l-methionine and plays a major role in modulating the methyltransferase activity. SabH composed of two domains includes cofactor binding domain and substrate-binding domain [30] which is present in ApAHc. The homocysteine precursor present in the AHc is strongly correlated with cardiovascular disease and growth of atherosclerosis [31]. However, recently reported that AHc also helps in regulating oxidative stress level in patients suffering from coronary artery diseases and also prevents endothelial dysfunction [32]. Also, deficiency of AHc promotes oxidative stress by decreasing Na+, K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex of rats by increasing S-adenosylmethionine [33].",

Also, the homology was highly conserved among the peptide regions (NL13) which was predicted to have potential antioxidant property.",

Further, this cyanobacterial group formed another cluster with plants; then finally formed a separate cluster with animals including fish, amphibians and mammals. Overall, the analysis showed the evolutionary relationship among the species. It is also meant that the protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of abiotic and biotic stress response in plants [37] and regulates oxidative stress in animals [32], which is confirming the clustering pattern due to their function that is involved in stress mechanism.",

Moreover, the secondary structure of corn protein hydrolysates was determined under circular dichroism that shows the lower \u03b1-helix is the major cause of strong antioxidant activity [38].

The HPLC analysis showed the purity of the peptide as 96.2% followed by the MALDI-TOF Mass spectroscopy confirmed the sequence. The molecular weight, isoelectric point and net charge of the peptide was 1.33 k Da, 0.54 and \u2212 2, respectively. Moreover, the peptide signifies the hydrophobicity 46.15%, acidic nature 15.33% and neutral nature 38.46%. The helical wheel structure projects the amphipathic nature of NL13 which is possessed with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature (Data shown in E-Suppl. File Fig. 6). Branched-chain amino acids including leucine, valine and isoleucine have found to be used as an antioxidant or anti-inflammatory products in the pharmaceutical industry [39]. Potential amino acids have shown strong antioxidant activity in Leucine than Isoleucine in Corn protein hydrolysates [38]. In accordance with the statement, our peptide NL13 also contained leucine (position 3 and 13) and valine (position 9) which predicted its potential antioxidant properties. Further Wattanasiritham et al. [20] reported that along with leucine and valine, alanine exhibit a higher antioxidant activity. It is noted that in our peptide sequence position 10 and 11 was occupied with alanine, position 3 and 13 was occupied with leucine and position 9 by valine. Proline has been considered as a non-enzymatic antioxidant residue because it is an efficient scavenger of OH\u00b7 and 1O2; that also prevents the damage due to lipid peroxidation [40]. It is interesting to note that NL13 contained proline at position 2, hence it is expected to function as reported. Moreover, antioxidant properties are also based on the hydrophobicity and the presence of aromatic amino acids. Also, it is reported [22] that the peptides with more than 1 k Da have found to show the highest antioxidant activity in African Bean seed protein hydrolysate fractions, which is relevant to our peptide, NL13 that is having a molecular weight of 1.33 k Da.",

Proline is a very effective scavenger of hydroxyl ions and peptide NL13 contains Proline (7.7%), it is predicted that the highest activity may be due to the presence of Proline.

The cell migration was noticed at 24 h (31.02%) in treatment and in control it was only 17.24%, whereas at 48 h the scenario was 82.76% in treatment and in control it was 62.07%. The cell migration rate was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in treated group than the control group (Fig. 6). Lee et al. [51] reported that HaCaT assay on AES16-2 M peptide showing effective cell migration at 16 h, in our case it was 24 h. However, the cell migration for NL13 was effective at 24 h of treatment. In comparison with the treated and untreated cells, the peptide treated cells are showing significantly faster relief than the untreated cells, thus the peptide NL13 effectively function on wound healing process. Effective wound healing activity was observed in peptides C2 and E1 on VERO cells [52]. Amino acids such as argenine and glutamine influences the wound healing activity by functioning through the immune system [23]. Proline is an amino acid that is present in collagen which is an essential connective tissue protein accelerating healing effects [53]. It has been reported that glycine, proline, hydroxyproline and alanine are the largest collagen molecules followed by serine, threonine, aspartic acid and Glutamic acid [54, 55]. NL13 has proline (at position 2), alanine (at position 10 and 11), serine (at position 4 and 12) and threonine (at position 5). The presence of these amino acids may have influenced the wound healing activity on VERO cells. Also, since NL13 peptide was found to reduce the ROS production on human leukocytes which could also have influenced to increase the cell migration rate on VERO cells. ",
