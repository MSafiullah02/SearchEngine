            "text": "Sepsis is a common disease in intensive care medicine representing almost one third of patient admissions. Its incidence has substantially increased over the past decades and overall mortality has declined during this period of time. It was reported that sepsis incidence increased from 82.7 to 240.4 per 100,000 population between 1979-2000. At the same time, sepsis global mortality decreased from 27.8 to 17.9% [1] [2] [3] . However, the absolute number of deaths significantly increased from 21.9 to 43.9 per 100,000 population. Male gender, some chronic diseases like diabetes, immunosuppressive states, human immunodeficiency virus infections, and malignancies are factors that increase the risk for sepsis. Some particular conditions like progressive number of organ dysfunctions, in-hospital-acquired infections and increasing age are associated with higher risk of death [1, 4] . On the other hand, septic shock mortality only diminished from 61.6 to 53.1% [5] . This slight decline in mortality observed during recent decades could be attributable to improvements in supportive care and/or avoidance of iatrogenic complications. For example, the instrumentation of early goal resuscitation protocols not aiming at supranormal targets for cardiac output and oxygen delivery, and the use of lung protective strategies could explain at least in part this favorable change. Other strategies directed to treat the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the septic process like recombinant human-activated protein-C (rhAPC), have also contributed to improve survival. However, mortality remains unacceptably high and further improvement in sepsis management is needed. Novel therapeutic approaches are under investigation and will probably be incorporated in the clinical practice in the near future.",

It was pursued to generate a change in the standard of care that could finally result in a significant mortality reduction. A consensus committee from several international organizations was created and evidence-based guidelines were elaborated [6] . Despite the fact that most of these recommendations were not supported by high levels of evidence, they represented the international consensus on the best available standards of care for the management of sepsis. These guidelines were recently updated and continue to be the core of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign [7] .

In the clinical setting, sepsis is diagnosed when an evident or suspected infection courses with a systemic response called the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). According to the 1991 North American Consensus Conference, SIRS was defined by the presence of at least two of the following signs: body temperature >38\u00baC or <36\u00baC, heart rate >90 beats/min, respiratory rate >20 breaths/min (or PaCO2 <30 torr), and/or white blood cells count >12,000 or <3,000/mm 3 [8] . However, these signs are too sensitive and nonspecific for sepsis and could occur in many other different situations not related to infection. In an attempt to better reflect the systemic response to infection, the clinical manifestations described by Bone et al. were expanded by the 2001 Consensus Conference [9] . Other possible signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings were summarized (Table 25.1) . Again, most of them are also nonspecific for sepsis. It is well known that infection and sepsis are sometimes difficult to confirm.",

The main significance of microvascular dysfunction has been studied during sepsis and major changes like decrease of both capillary density and microvascular blood flow were documented in vivo by video microscopy [14] . Thus, peripheral gas exchange becomes impaired and tissue dysoxia ensues. These abnormalities also occur despite normal or even supranormal hemodynamic variables. In terms of peripheral oxygen metabolism, severe heterogeneity of oxygen distribution within the tissues is characteristic during septic shock. Under-and overperfuse areas coexist within the same tissue resulting in an inhomogeneous tissue oxygen partial pressure distribution (PtO2). In these conditions, metabolic demands are not met by microvascular oxygen delivery, making peripheral shunting and tissue dysoxia the cause of organ failure.",

Lack of high-level evidence coming from large RCT is a severe limitation in sepsis. To accomplish these goals, experts determined that improving patient care was a possible task and could lead to a significant decrease in mortality. Despite the fact that only a few of the Guidelines were supported by high levels of evidence, it was agreed that they represent the best available evidence for the management of the septic patient. During the last consensus conference a grade system was agreed upon by the participants.

Additional information comes from an open-label observational study, the ENHANCE that suggested that early administration of rhAPC was associated with better outcomes [43] . As a result, the latest recommendation of the SSC is to consider rhAPC only for adult patients at high risk of death (APACHE II \u226525 or multiple organ failure).

It is recommended to use sedation protocols with daily interruption/lightening to produce awakening [7] . \u2022 Renal replacement therapy. Current evidence is insufficient to draw strong conclusions regarding the best replacement therapy method for ARI in septic patients [44, 45] . It is not clear whether high doses of renal replacement may influence patient outcome [46] . Intermittent hemodialysis and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVH) are considered equivalent for septic patients. However, CVVH and sustained low-efficiency dialysis will probably offer a safer and easier management in hemodynamically unstable patients. \u2022 Bicarbonate therapy. Sodium bicarbonate infusion must not be used for the purpose of improving hemodynamics or reducing vasopressor requirements when treating hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia with a pH \u22657.15 [7] . \u2022 Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Use either low-dose unfractioned heparin (UFH) or low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unless contraindicated. Use a mechanical prophylactic device when heparin is contraindicated [7] . \u2022 Stress ulcer prophylaxis. Stress ulcer prophylaxis based on H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors could be used for septic patients [7] . \u2022 Nutritional support. It is very important to initiate early nutritional support in critically ill patients. Enteral nutrition is generally safer and more effective than total parenteral nutrition. Immunonutrition needs to be further studied before clear recommendations can be made. As mentioned before, these guidelines were based on the best available evidence. Ongoing and future studies will provide further valuable information and changes in these recommendations will become necessary. The use of these guidelines is not easy in clinical practice. It was an objective of the SSC to facilitate the instrumentation of these recommendations [47] . In the last phase of the SSC the concept of sepsis bundles was introduced. This idea aimed to create a series of simple recommendations easily applicable as packages of measurements for the clinical setting [48] . Conceptually, a bundle is a group of interventions that when implemented together will result in better outcomes. The bundles were developed in conjunction with the Institutes for Health Care Improvement (IHCI). Different tools were created to assist clinicians at the bedside. These clinical tools and databases are available on the SSC web page. Treatment of severe sepsis can be organized into two groups of interventions known as the initial resuscitation bundle (initial 6 h) and the management bundle (24 h bundle) [49] . Table 25 .2 summarizes this particular approach. Some recent works have studied bundles compliance and new favorable results on outcomes are coming. It has been shown that bundles compliance is associated with a reduction in ICU mortality and length of stay [50, 51] . ",
