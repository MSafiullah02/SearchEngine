Tissue from the second patient had a cluster infiltration of neutrophils (CD11b and CD16) and activated macrophages (Arg1), a diffuse infiltration of mature T cells (CD45RA and CD4), and a scattered infiltration of natural killer cells and dendritic cells (CD276 and CD14), which distributed differently from macrophages and were accompanied by local overexpression of type 1 collagen. The distributions of infiltration by macrophages, mature T cells, and natural killer cells in the 2 patients were different, as was the expression of type 1 collagen, and the second patient had more dendritic cells. Both patients had relatively independent distributions of cell subsets by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and PhenoGraph analysis. The first patient had more infiltration by immune cells. This patient had a cluster distribution of mature T cells (CD45RA) and macrophages. The second patient had a cluster distribution of mature T cells (CD45RA and CD45RO) and macrophages, which correlated with bacterial infection. More CD45RA + T cells were recruited in the first patient, whereas mostly CD45RO + T cells were recruited in the second patient. Additional data and figures are available from the authors on request.",

Our study suggests that these infiltrated mononuclear cells are CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages; that recruitment of aberrant CD45RA + T cells is the immunologic feature of COVID-19; and that once bacterial pneumonia occurs, some phagocytes recruited by CD4 T cells begin to play a major role in lung injury. We conclude that additional studies are needed to understand the immune response in patients with COVID-19. Representative mass cytometry images for each panel are different colors, and expression levels are in parentheses. Iridium-DNA staining is shown in blue. All images are from the same tissue sections. We designed a metal isotope-labeled antibody panel to detect multiple markers simultaneously in 1 slide by using the imaging mass cytometry system. For detailed methods, please refer to the Imaging Mass Cytometry Staining Protocol for FFPE Sections on the Fluidigm website (http://cn.fluidigm.com/search?query=IMC+Staining+Protocol&resourceTypes=protocol). All raw data were acquired using a Hyperion Imaging System (Fluidigm). The resulting files were in MCD format and were exported as TIFF files using the MCD Viewer.
