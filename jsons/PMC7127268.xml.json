The age of onset of diarrhea is an important factor in ruling in or out some agents. F5 (K99) E coli typically causes diarrhea in calves less than 6-days old, whereas Cryptosporidium will not be detectable in the feces before 3-days old and coccidia not before 15 to 21 days due to their prepatent periods. The presence of blood in the feces of calves less than 30-days old is most commonly associated with Salmonella, coronavirus, attaching and effacing E coli, and, rarely, Cryptosporidium and Clostridium.",

For instance, in a dairy situation, if affected calves are disproportionately born in the evening, weekends, or holidays, this might indicate inadequate training of some personnel responsible for ensuring calves receive colostrum and are moved to a clean, dry area (calf hutch, calf pen or clean cow-calf area). When most affected calves are the offspring of primiparous heifers and the dams\u2019 colostrum is fed to calves, this might indicate dry cow vaccines (rotavirus, coronavirus, and K99 E coli) that are used in multiparous cows have not been given to first-calving heifers. First-calf heifers may also have lower quality and quantity of colostrum. In beef cow-calf operations, use of pens for calving and nursing cows may lead to build up of pathogens shed by cows and their calves over the duration of the calving season, thereby exposing newborn calves to higher pathogen loads and increasing the likelihood of their developing diarrhea. The calving pen or calf housing may be a source of pathogens that persist from year to year in moist cool areas.",

Each test method has limitations; the laboratory to which the veterinarian submits samples should be able to provide this information. Case-control studies and fecal surveys have detected all enteric pathogens associated with calf diarrhea in calves that do not have diarrhea. Both host and pathogen factors influence the severity and likelihood a calf will develop diarrhea. The major host factors include the general health, nutrition, immunity to specific pathogens, and age of exposure. The major pathogen factors include the number of infectious particles, number of concurrent diseases, and virulence of the agent. For this reason, it is incumbent on the clinician to interpret the detection of pathogens in the context of the signs and clinical history. Necropsy and histopathology of good quality tissues can aid in determining the role of an agent in causing diarrhea by the detection of lesions in the tissues associated with that agent.",

PCR methods are usually more sensitive (\u223c103 organisms/mL) than antigen-detection methods (104\u2013107organisms/mL), such as ELISA, fluorescent antibody (FA), agglutination, and chromatography (lateral flow, dipstick); and more sensitive than direct visualization (106\u2013107 organisms/mL), such as electron microscopy (EM), fecal flotation, or stained fecal smears.1, 2 However, PCR methods may miss viruses or bacteria that have mutated or drifted from the sequence specific to the primers in use.1 PCR methods may detect lower levels of pathogens that may not be causing disease due to age resistance (F5 [K99] E coli) or may detect the pathogen after the signs of illness have resolved.2 PCR methods detect pathogens even in the presence of antibody-antigen complexes. However, if the agent is bound to antibody, it is less likely to be causing disease, so detection by PCR may overestimate its significance. PCR methods may fail to detect an agent due to inhibitory substances in the sample, which is more likely to occur in fecal samples than in lung or nasal swabs. Newer methods to extract nucleic acid have overcome many of the problems posed by testing of feces for organisms such as Salmonella, making PCR as sensitive as culture. However, the sensitivity of each method may vary with the species of Salmonella found in the sample.1, 3 Dead or stressed bacteria can be detected by PCR in samples in which they might not grow in cultures.3 Sample quality, quantity, appropriate type, storage, and transport are all important issues to be aware of when submitting samples for PCR to ensure the pathogen of interest is not denatured or destroyed. PCR methods will increase the detection of low levels of organisms that arise from cross-contamination from one calf to another when fecal samples are collected using the same instruments to open the intestinal tract or while wearing the same pair of examination gloves to collect feces from multiple animals. If the goal is simply to determine the presence of the agent in a group of animals, cross-contamination is less of a concern on the same premise than if the goal is to determine the prevalence of agents in clinically affected animals to prioritize prevention strategies. Cleaning instruments well between premises is vital to ensure agents are not detected on a premise where they do not exist due to use of contaminated instruments from another premise.",

            "text": "Moxley and Smith8 wrote an excellent review of the literature of experimental and natural infection and epidemiologic studies related to finding attaching and effacing E coli (AEEC; with intimin [eae] genes) with or without Shiga toxin (also known as verotoxin), Stx1 or Stx2 genes, and Shiga toxin\u2013producing Escherichia coli (STEC) without the eae genes. Using the human literature definitions, E coli with both Shiga toxin and eae genes are considered enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and include O157:H7, which can be found in cattle as carriers and has been shown to attach and cause diarrhea in some studies.8\nE coli with the eae genes but no Shiga toxin genes are referred to as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). All three groups (EHEC, EPEC, and STEC) have been found in diarrhea calves with natural infections and have been used successfully to reproduce enteritis and/or colitis in some, but not all, inoculated calves. Several studies demonstrated that calves less than 24-hours old without colostral antibodies are more likely to develop diarrhea and intestinal lesions when inoculated with the organisms than are older calves or calves that have received colostrum.8 Epidemiologic studies that are stratified by age also show as much as 10 to 12 times higher recovery of AEEC or STEC-type organisms in calves less than 30-days old with diarrhea compared with controls without diarrhea.8 In calves over 30-days old or in reports in which calves of all ages were clustered, as well as in adult animals, there is either no difference or only an approximately twofold difference in fecal detection rates between diarrhea and nondiarrhea animals.8, 9 Based on histologic confirmation, AEEC organisms most often cause diarrhea in calves between 2- to 21-days old with a mean age of 10 to 12 days.8, 10, 11, 12 Occasional cases have been reported in calves up to 4-months old and adults.8, 10, 11, 12 Following experimental inoculation, onset of diarrhea ranged from 1 to 4 days and lasted for 1 to 7 days.8 In some studies, calves had onset of a mild fever (up to 40\u00b0C) between 36 hours and 4 days postinoculation that lasted 1 to 3 days. However, experimentally, the onset and severity of clinical signs are influenced by specific type of E coli, dosage, age at exposure, and colostral immunity. The literature suggests the same is true of natural infections.",

Janke and colleagues10, 12 observed attachment in the colon In 88.4% of cases, which included 31.7% of cases with both small intestine (ileum) and colon attachment, only 11.7% of cases had attachment in the small intestine alone. AEEC cause a distinct histologic appearance at the attachment sites where clusters of short gram-negative rods attach and form a scalloped appearance to the epithelial cells (Fig. 2\n).8, 10, 12 These cells undergo damage to their microvillus surface, round up, degenerate, and slough from the lamina propria. When the small intestine is affected, villus atrophy results from loss of affected cells. Inflammation may be mild but varies with duration of the lesion.8 On gross necropsy, the colon mucosa may be normal or have longitudinal reddening, roughening, and petechial hemorrhages (Fig. 3\n).8 Blood flecks, attached clots, or frank hemorrhage, mucus, and fibrin are also seen in some calves.8 Occasional cases may develop a pseudomembrane in the small intestine. The gross findings are not specific to AEEC and may be seen with coronavirus and Salmonella in calves less than 30-days old. Feces can vary in color and consistency. Some calves will have watery yellow feces, whereas others may have blood in the feces, which is most common with EHEC strains.8, 10, 12 In some calves, the feces may appear near normal, probably due to dehydration (Pat Blanchard, unpublished observation). The cecum and descending colon or rectum may have lesions when the spiral colon does not.8\n",

To confirm an E coli isolated from the intestine is an attaching and effacing strain, PCR screening for the presence of the eae or toxin genes (Stx1, Stx2) is needed. A small in-house study at the authors\u2019 laboratory, found 85% of calves with moderate to large number of attaching organisms in the colon had the eae gene in 9 to 10 of 10 isolates selected from the 4+ growth zone of a colon swab plated on MacConkey agar; whereas only two of four calves had the eae gene in 1 to 2 of 10 isolates and the other two had no isolates with the eae gene when rare to small number of organisms were seen attaching (Pat Blanchard, unpublished observation).

            "text": "Enterotoxigenic E coli bacteria possess the fimbrial antigen F5 often referred to as K99. The fimbria allows the bacteria to attach to the villus epithelial cells of the small intestine and secrete a toxin. After attaching, the heat stable toxin (STa) acts on the epithelial cells to result in marked fluid efflux into the small intestine lumen.13 The attachment factors are most commonly expressed on immature villus epithelial cells. Therefore, normal postnatal maturation limits the disease potential of this organism to calves usually less than 6-days old.13, 14 There may be periods of increased susceptibility after 5-days old if calves experience villus atrophy from other causes (viruses and Cryptosporidium) resulting in immature cells migrating from the crypts to cover the villus tips.13 In one study testing only feces from calves with diarrhea, 17 of 26 animals with F5 E coli isolated had concurrent infection with Cryptosporidium, rotavirus, and/or coronavirus.15 F5 E coli were found in all ages up to 30 days, but the authors did not indicate if the animals with F5 E coli isolated after 5-days old were the same ones with concurrent other pathogens. Unfortunately, most published prevalence studies are based on testing feces from diarrhea and nondiarrhea calves; therefore, there is no histopathology to show the organism is attaching. In Table 3, the mean age of 2.5 days and age range of 1 to 7 days for K99 (F5) E coli is based on necropsies in which the organism was seen attaching by histopathology and confirmed by latex agglutination on feces or isolates.",

However, more often, some degree of enteritis is present histologically even in the absence of diarrhea. In some cases, the primary disease is enteric with diarrhea similar to S newport and S typhimurium. S dublin can cause diarrhea in calves as young as 5-days old but, more commonly, it occurs in calves from 1- to 4-months old.19 A typical history is that calves show respiratory signs, diarrhea, illthrift, and have a poor response to antibiotics used for common causes of bronchopneumonia. Outbreaks can occur with high morbidity and mortality. Lesions of S dublin septicemia commonly include splenomegaly; hepatomegaly with a bronze coloration to the liver, lungs that fail to collapse on opening the chest cavity with hundreds of petechial hemorrhages; or plum-colored, wet and heavy (meaty texture) lungs involving caudal lobes; one or more cranial lobes; or all lobes (Fig. 6\n). On occasion, lesions will be limited to the cranial lung but, histologically, these lesions, like the wet, heavy lung, are due to variable amounts of fibrin, some forming hyaline membranes, and interstitial pneumonia with neutrophils and histiocytes. A single plug (coagulum of fibrin and bile) may be found in the gall bladder of some calves (Fig. 7\n) and is pathognomonic for Salmonella septicemia. Some calves may be icteric or have petechial hemorrhages in the kidney and gastrointestinal serosa. A few calves will have meningitis or polyarthritis. A rare dry gangrene condition associated with S dublin may be seen in winter months. Dry gangrene develops in the tips of the ears, tail, and both rear legs. In the legs, a sharp line of demarcation may form across the midmetatarsus or the gangrene may be limited to the phalanges. The foot may fall off. Lesions are similar to those seen with ergot but are linked to vascular thrombosis due to S dublin. The organism can usually be isolated from the feces of some affected calves though classic septicemia lesions are not present. S dublin can be carried by healthy cows and shed sporadically in milk and feces.20 It is possible that young calves harbor the organism in their intestine or mesenteric lymph nodes until colostral antibodies wane, allowing it to spread.",

False negative PCR or isolation may occur due to suppression of growth in enrichment broth by normal intestinal flora or use of antibiotics in the animal so the organism may be present in numbers too few to detect. PCR methods on intestine may be impacted by release of enzymes from other bacteria that damage the nucleic acid of Salmonella sp making them undetectable.1 Rapid, accurate detection methods continue to be developed and improved, primarily driven by the food industry.

In a multistate study in the United States, C parvum was the primary species (\u223c90% of Cryptosporidium) colonizing calves up to 4-weeks old and the only species found in calves less than 3-weeks old.23 The peak prevalence of calves shedding Cryptosporidium was 66.7% at 2-weeks old when only C parvum was seen.

The lower limits are more often associated with concentration of oocysts before detection. Quantitation of the organism by direct examination, including acid-fast stains and flotation may be misleading because low numbers may reflect the stage of infection (early or late) instead of the severity.

This, combined with postmortem loss of infected epithelial cells, leads to false negative results. One study36 using small intestine for rotavirus FA noted a 33% agreement between FA and EM. For coronavirus, comparing FA and IHC to direct EM was reported to have a relative sensitivity of 63% to 80%38, 42 and 83%,42 respectively. For coronavirus, the spiral colon is a more reliable site for FA because the infected cells are retained in the crypts, less susceptible to postmortem loss, and have been reported to persist in the colon longest.40 Extensive FA positive staining may occur in the spiral colon in early infections because diarrhea onset precedes necrosis of colon cells. Later stage infections, when only rare necrotic crypts surrounded by fibrous tissue are present, will occasionally have focal positive staining. Detection of coronavirus by FA on frozen colon tissue has a good correlation with the presence of colon lesions by histopathology (Pat Blanchard, personal observation).",

Sarcina forms packets of 8 to 16 cocci detectable by histopathology in the abomasal lumen and sometimes the wall of affected calves.45 Studies with this organism alone or in combination with C perfringens failed to reproduce the bloat condition (Ken Mills, PhD, Laramie, WY, personal communication, 2006). The appearance of the organism in the abomasum on histopathology is associated with bloat and has not been found in calves (Pat Blanchard, unpublished observation) or goats46 that die from other causes. Affected calves are less than 30-days old and receive some type of milk product including whole milk or milk replacers and may even be nursing cows on pasture. Esophageal intubation is not effective in relieving the bloat because the tube does not reach the abomasum. Using a large-bore needle inserted in the right flank may relieve the gas.
