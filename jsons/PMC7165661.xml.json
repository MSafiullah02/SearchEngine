            "text": "The role of bats in the maintenance and transmission of rabies and other lyssaviruses has long been known, and they are now increasingly recognized as reservoirs for other viruses (e.g. members of the families Paramyxoviridae, Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Reoviridae, Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae) that \u2018spill over\u2019 or cross species barriers to infect humans, domestic animals and other wildlife (Calisher et al., 2006). Given their abundance, wide distribution, high mobility and apparent ability to harbour highly pathogenic viruses with little or no effect, bats may present a greater risk of zoonotic transmission than do other animals (Calisher et al., 2006). There is therefore considerable interest in characterizing viral diversity in these animals. Recent efforts applying metagenomic sequencing and/or consensus\u2010degenerate PCR primers and conventional sequencing techniques to bat faecal/oral swabs and other bat tissues have resulted in the detection of a wide range of viruses including bat influenza A viruses (Tong et al., 2012), several paramyxoviruses (Drexler et al., 2012), hepaciviruses and pegiviruses (Quan et al., 2013), and close relatives of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (Ithete et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013).",

Alphavirus antibodies previously detected in bats include eastern (EEEV), Venezuelan (VEEV) and western (WEEV) equine encephalitis viruses (Price, 1978a; McLean et al., 1979; Ubico and McLean, 1995). All but the latter are associated with deadly epidemics in humans and/or horses. Included among the flaviviruses for which antibodies have been detected are important pathogenic arboviruses such as WNV, SLEV, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and dengue viruses (DENV) (Price, 1978a; Herbold et al., 1983; Ubico and McLean, 1995; Bunde et al., 2006; Aguilar\u2010Setien et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2008; Machain\u2010Williams et al., 2013). However, it is still unclear whether bats serve as important amplification/reservoir hosts for any of these viruses.",

TABV has only ever been isolated once, from Pteronotus parnellii in Trinidad (Price, 1978b; de Lamballerie et al., 2002).

Bats were transported live in covered metal cages to the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of the West Indies where they were taxonomically classified based on morphology. Bat specimens were identified to species firstly by experienced ARU and MALMR personnel and then confirmed by our laboratory by descriptions made in Goodwin, 1961.

During the period when our serosurvey was conducted, Mucambo virus was repeatedly isolated from mosquitoes collected from forested regions of Trinidad (Auguste et al., 2009, 2010) including one of the seropositive locations.

There are no other published serological reports of TABV for comparison, and with only one record of isolation (Price, 1978b), there is a dearth of information on the biology of this virus. This single isolation was from the saliva of a bat. Transmission via oral secretions could explain the observed associations with bat species (P < 0.001; \u03c72 = 64.17) and feeding preference (P < 0.001; \u03c72 = 40.81) for this \u2018no\u2010known vector\u2019 virus.

Given the hematophagous feeding nature of this bat species, there is also presumably a risk of infection of humans and livestock, particularly in rural areas where seroprevalence rates were significantly higher (P < 0.05; \u03c72) and where bat bites in livestock are not uncommon.",

However, cross\u2010reactivity among flaviviruses (such as RBV, TABV, SLEV) in different complexes is frequently observed with HIA test especially in sequential flaviviral infections (Casals, 1957). To positively identify the causative virus(es), a wider panel of HIA antigens including other flavi\u2010 and alphaviruses previously detected in this region (i.e. Dengue, Rocio, Cacipacore, Iguape, VEEV IIIA (Mucambo), Una and Mayaro viruses) or plaque reduction neutralization tests would be necessary. Unfortunately, the small volumes of sera available did not allow for this. PCR might also be used to detect viral RNA but as arboviral infections are generally transient, the chance of the sera collected being viremic is extremely low. Enzyme\u2010linked immunoassays and hemagglutination inhibition (HIA) test, among others, are classical tests that lack specificity and have inherent problems in interpretation, in areas that are hyperendemic for flaviviruses. Testing by these methods may result in broad cross\u2010reactions and therefore difficulty in determining the etiologic virus (Beaty et al., 1989). Hemagglutintion inhibition requires a wide panel of viral antigens usually along with acute and convalescent sera to adequately determine specific etiologic agents by identifying fourfold rise or fall in titre values. ELISA inhibition methods increase specificity and sensitivity and this has been demonstrated when compared with HIA for dengue diagnosis and surveillance (Beaty et al., 1989; Fern\u00e1ndez, 1990). Epitope\u2010blocking ELISAs have been developed with diagnostic efficacy similar to PRNT for detection of arboviral antibodies including WNV and VEEV (Blitvich et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005).",

Of the nine species (67 bats) found to be seropositive for at least one of these viruses, five are new records for VEEV antibodies and one for RBV. We also found statistically significant associations among VEEV\u2010seropositive bats and roosts in close proximity to humans and their livestock, as well as for TABV\u2010seropositive bats (especially vampires) and their feeding and roosting habits in rural communities. Our data suggest that bat flaviviruses may be more easily transmitted among bats than the alphaviruses or that there is a difference in the viruses in circulation at the time of this study. Bat species tested and other factors may also influence the different rates observed. However, there is not enough data here to suggest that bats are less infected by one of these genera. Further work would be required to determine the specific role of bats in the enzootic maintenance and spread of these viruses, how the risk factors identified relate to their biology and whether they pose a risk to human and livestock populations.",
