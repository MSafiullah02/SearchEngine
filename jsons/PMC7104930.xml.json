SARS-CoV was contained within 3 months after its discovery, while MERS-CoV causes a classical zoonotic infection with limited human-to-human spread and, as yet, is incapable of sustained community transmission (Reusken et al., 2016, Zumla et al., 2015). However, four other respiratory coronaviruses\u2014alphacoronaviruses NL63 and 229E and lineage A betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1\u2014successfully breached the species barrier and are currently maintained in the human population worldwide through continuous circulation (Su et al., 2016, de Groot et al., 2011). Conceivably, the study of these genuine human coronaviruses (HCoVs) may yield clues to what is required for viral adaptation to the human host and thereby increase our understanding of the probabilities and risks of coronavirus cross-species transmission.",

OC43, the best-studied HCoV, apparently arose relatively recently, 120 to 70 years ago, with the most recent common ancestor of all extant OC43 variants dating to the 1950s (Lau et al., 2011, Vijgen et al., 2005, Vijgen et al., 2006). OC43 groups in the species Betacoronavirus-1 (\u03b21CoV), together with highly related viruses from ruminants (bovine coronavirus, BCoV), swine (porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, PHEV), equines (equine coronavirus, ECoV), leporids (rabbit coronavirus HKU14, RbCoV), and canines (canine respiratory coronavirus, CRCoV) (de Groot et al., 2011; Figure 1\nA). The extraordinary radiation of \u03b21CoVs might be explained from their receptor usage, as they attach to 9-O-acetylated sialic acids (9-O-Ac-Sias) (Matrosovich et al., 2015), i.e., glycan components common in mammals and birds (Traving and Schauer, 1998). Paradoxically, however, most \u03b21CoVs, including OC43, have very narrow host ranges. They form distinct monophyletic clades congruent with host selectivity, and phylogenetic evidence strongly argues against recurrent inter-species transmissions (Lau et al., 2011, Vijgen et al., 2006; see also Figure 1A). With the emergence of OC43 seemingly sparked by a singular one-time zoonotic event, the founder virus likely possessed unique traits already to allow efficient infection of, and transmission among, humans. In turn, these traits and subsequent adaptations to the new niche must have closed the door on reintroduction of the virus into animals. Despite the close genetic relationship between OC43 and BCoV-Mebus, particularly (96.6% identity across their entire genomes), their high-prevalence endemicity/enzooticity, and the scale and frequency of interactions between their host species, there is no evidence of OC43 spreading to cattle nor of BCoV (or any other \u03b21CoV) efficiently spreading into humans (Figure 1A).",

            "text": "\u03b21CoV attachment involves two distinct types of surface projections: large 20-nm \u201cspikes\u201d comprised of homotrimers of the class I fusion protein S and stubby 8-nm protrusions that are homodimeric assemblies of the hemagglutinin-esterase protein HE (de Groot et al., 2011). The S protein, common to all coronaviruses, mediates receptor binding and fusion of the viral and host membranes (Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012). HEs are found in toroviruses and in influenza C and D viruses, but among coronaviruses, only in lineage A betacoronaviruses (de Groot, 2006, de Groot et al., 2011, Hause et al., 2014, Matrosovich et al., 2015). HE monomers have a bimodular structure with a carbohydrate-binding (\u201clectin\u201d) domain appended to an enzymatically active sialate-O-acetylesterase (\u201cesterase\u201d) domain (Langereis et al., 2009, Rosenthal et al., 1998, Zeng et al., 2008). Typically, in \u03b21CoVs, both the spikes and HEs bind 9-O-Ac-Sias, while the HE esterase domain promotes virus elution through receptor destruction. In consequence of the opposing activities of receptor binding and receptor destruction, \u03b21CoV attachment to sialoglycans is dynamic and reversible. Thus, dead-end binding of virions to decoy receptors in oropharyngeal, respiratory, and gastrointestinal mucus may be prevented. Moreover, in infected host cells, HE-mediated receptor destruction is essential for efficient release of viral progeny (Desforges et al., 2013).",

We demonstrate that over decades after OC43\u2019s introduction, its evolution was marked by a progressive loss of HE receptor-binding activity through the accumulation of select mutations in the HE lectin domain. The effect of these mutations on the organization of the carbohydrate-binding site (CBS) and on receptor binding is explained from the crystal structure of the BCoV HE-receptor complex (Zeng et al., 2008) and visualized directly by the structure of a contemporary OC43 HE solved to 2.45\u00c5 resolution. Evidence is provided that loss of HE receptor-binding activity resulted in a reduction of virion-associated esterase activity toward multivalent clustered substrates. We propose that inactivation of the HE lectin domain altered the balance between virion binding and esterase-mediated virion elution, apparently as an adaptation to the sialoglycome of the human respiratory tract, and we speculate that this may be a contributing factor to host selectivity. This view is supported by our observation that the HE of HCoV-HKU1 also lost its receptor-binding properties. A mechanism is proposed in which accessibility of receptors to destruction depends on HE lectin function in relation to S-HE size differences and in which the balance between attachment and catalysis-driven virion elution is a determinant of host tropism.",

To identify the differences accounting for loss of lectin activity in OC43 USA/1967 HE, we introduced OC43-specific substitutions in BCoV-Mebus HE0-Fc, in sets and individually, and tested for a reduction in lectin activity by HAA (Figure S2A). In a complementary approach, OC43 HE residues were systematically replaced by BCoV HE orthologs (Figures S2B\u2013S2D). The results show that the mutations in the esterase and MP domains of OC43 USA/1967 HE (Figures 2A\u20132C; Figure S2A) do not affect ligand binding. In fact, loss of 9-O-Ac-Sia binding can be attributed to four out of eight substitutions in the lectin domain (T114N, R177P, E178Q, and F247L; Figures S2A\u2013S2D). Combined replacement of these residues in OC43 USA/1967 HE0 by BCoV orthologs restored binding affinity to that of BCoV-Mebus HE (Figure 2C). Individual replacement of these residues in the context of a restored OC43 USA/1967 HE (\u201cTREF\u201d) showed that each mutation affects receptor binding to more (T114N, E178Q) or lesser (R177P, F247L) extent (Figure 2C).",

            "text": "The impact of these mutations on 9-O-Ac-Sia binding can be understood from the crystal structure of the BCoV-Mebus HE-receptor complex (Zeng et al., 2008). The BCoV HE receptor-binding region is comprised of six surface loops, five grafted on the beta-sandwich core of the lectin domain and one emanating from the esterase domain (Figure S3A). The actual carbohydrate-binding site consists of a deep hydrophobic pocket P1 and a more shallow hydrophobic depression P2 that accommodate the methyl groups of the Sia-9-O- and \u22125-N-acetyl moieties, respectively (Figure 4E). The side chain of F211 (a residue in the \u03b212/\u03b213 \u03b2-hairpin) separates P1 from P2 and, in the HE-receptor complex, intercalates between the Sia-acetyl groups. Ligand binding, thus largely based on shape complementarity and hydrophobic interactions, is stabilized by extensive protein-sugar hydrogen bonding, particularly involving the \u03b27\u2013\u03b210 \u03b2-hairpin, through main chain atoms of L212 and N214 to the sialate-5-N-acyl amide and the Sia carboxylate, respectively, and through the side-chain hydroxyl of S213 to the sialate-C8-hydroxyl and -C9-acyl oxygen. Y184 in the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop (residues 176\u2013185) is particularly important for ligand binding as its side-chain hydroxyl group hydrogen bonds with the sialate-9-O-acetyl carbonyl, while its aromatic ring together with the side chains of F211, L266, and L267 walls the P1 pocket that is key to receptor recognition (Figure 4E).",

A glycan attached to this site would extend into the CBS and potentially reduce receptor binding through steric hindrance. Indeed, the introduction of this glycosylation site in BCoV HE0 resulted in an almost complete loss of binding as detected by sp-LBA (Figure 2C) and a 250-fold loss of apparent binding affinity as measured by HAA (Figure 2D; Figure S2A). The same mutant protein, but now expressed in N-acetyl glucosamine transferase I (GnTI)-deficient HEK293S GnTI\u2212 cells instead of HEK293T cells, showed a less pronounced loss of binding affinity (30-fold in HAA; Figure 2D).

We offer that in OC43 HE, the replacement by Gln and consequential loss of inter-loop hydrogen bonding destabilizes the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop and that its increased flexibility impairs the Sia-binding site, presumably by affecting the critical P1 pocket. The consequences of the other two substitutions in OC43 USA/1967 HE are less evident, although it can be envisaged that the R177P replacement might again affect folding and/or stability of the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop and thereby indirectly the positioning of the critical Y184 residue. The F247L substitution is more difficult to explain as the affected residue locates to the core of the HE lectin domain, distal to the CBS, and the mutation apparently decreases ligand binding through indirect long-range effects.

This wealth of information allowed us to study the recent evolution of the OC43 HE protein. In phylograms, in accordance with the presumptive date of OC43 emergence, the HE of the USA/1967 strain is placed close to the root (Figure S1). In the decades thereafter, the HE proteins divided into three clades. Clade C, the least populous, is comprised of HEs from OC43 strains sampled in the early 1990s with no recent representatives and may have been replaced by clades A and B. Comparative sequence analysis in combination with structure-function analysis showed that both type A and B HEs acquired several mutations in the lectin domain additional to those already present in OC43 USA/1967, which explains the loss of HE receptor binding in extant OC43 variants. Unexpectedly, in B-type HEs, but not in those of types A and C, glycosylation at N114 was lost again due to a S116A substitution (NRS\u2192NRA). Further inspection revealed the replacement in B-type OC43 HEs of D220 by Y. D220 is part of a potassium ion-coordinating metal-binding site (MBS), a signature element of coronavirus HE lectin domains involved in the organization of the Sia-binding site (Figure 3\nA) (Zeng et al., 2008). The MBS is formed by main-chain carbonyl atoms of S221, E265, and L267, together with the side chains of Q222, S263, and D220, the latter of which is particularly important as it balances the positive charge of the metal ion. In BCoV HE0, the D220Y mutation resulted in loss of all detectable binding to 9-O-Ac-Sia (Figures 3B and 3C). In turn, a Y220D back mutation in the type B HE of OC43 NL/B/2005 restored Sia-binding activity to levels detectable by high-sensitivity nanobead HAA (Figure 3D). Again, the structure of the BCoV HE-receptor complex provides an explanation for the detrimental effect of the mutation. As L266 and L267 are in a loop that is stabilized through the coordination of the potassium ion, disruption of the MBS might affect the folding of this loop, the positioning of the Leu residues, and thereby the structure of receptor-binding pocket P1.",

As evident from comparative sequence and phylogenetic analysis, the substitutions in A- and B-type HEs were independent events, and their selection must be ascribed to convergent evolution. Again, D220H mutation in BCoV HE resulted in loss of detectable Sia binding as measured by sp-LBA (Figure 3B). Unexpectedly, however, in conventional HAA routinely performed at 4\u00b0C, wild-type and mutant BCoV HEs hemagglutinated to similar extent (Figure 3E). The effect of the mutation became evident after a shift up to 37\u00b0C, upon which hemagglutination with wild-type BCoV HE remained stable while that of the mutant protein resolved (Figure 3E). Apparently, substitution of D220 by His is less disruptive than by Tyr, but results in thermolability of HE receptor binding, likely to cause reduced binding affinity under physiological conditions. Repair of the OC43-specific substitutions already present in the HE of the 1967 strain (Figure 2A), in conjunction with a H220D back substitution, did not restore lectin activity of OC43 NL/A/2005 HE (Figure 3F), suggesting the presence of at least one additional mutation to prevent receptor binding. Comparative sequence analysis revealed a major change uniformly shared by A-type HEs again in the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop, with four adjacent residues 183\u2013186, Asp-Tyr-Tyr-Tyr, replaced by Ile-Ile-Thr (Figure 2A), apparently as a result of a double frameshift mutation (Figure S3C). Repair of this mutation, in combination with restorative changes at the other five sites, was required for OC43 NL/A/2005 HE to regain receptor-binding activity (Figure 3F). The impact of the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop mutation is easily understood from the structure of the BCoV HE-receptor complex, as it involved loss of Y184, an essential residue for ligand binding.",

In overall fold, OC43 HE is highly similar to other coronavirus HEs (Figure 4\n). Differences in the esterase domain are limited to substitution of five surface residues, none likely to impair esterase function or activity. OC43 HE is also identical to BCoV HE in most of its lectin domain, particularly in the beta-sandwich core, but the loops shaping the receptor-binding site have changed dramatically (Figure 4D; Figure S3D). The \u03b211-\u03b212 and \u03b25-\u03b26 loops are disordered, suggestive of extensive flexibility, in the case of the latter loop in accordance with loss of E178-mediated inter-loop hydrogen bonding. Those (parts of the) loops that can be visualized are reoriented and displaced with respect to their original position in BCoV HE, utterly destroying the CBS. For example the \u03b27/\u03b210 \u03b2-hairpin, comprising F211, L212, S213, and N214 that are key to protein-ligand interaction in BCoV HE (Zeng et al., 2008), has shifted by approximately 7\u00c5 (Figure 4D). The P1 pocket, arguably the most critical element of the CBS, no longer exists as (1) F211 is no longer at its original position and its side chain is rotated by 90\u00b0, (2) Y184 was lost as a result of the frameshift mutation in the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop, and (3) the side chains of L266 and L267 are reoriented apparently due to the loss of the MBS (Figures 4E and 4F). Finally, attached to N114 is an N-acetylglucosamine, providing formal evidence that the newly introduced glycosylation site in OC43 HEs is functional. Although the remaining residues of the sugar chain could not be visualized, the glycan would stretch across the remains of the CBS (Figure 4F).",

Like OC43, HCoV-HKU1 binds to 9-O-Ac-Sia receptor determinants via its spike (Huang et al., 2015), and it possesses an HE (Woo et al., 2005b). The HE of the prototypical HCoV-HKU1 2005 Hong Kong genotype A strain (Woo et al., 2006) tested negative for 9-O-Ac-Sia binding by sp-LBA, standard HAA, and nanobead HAA (Figures 1B\u20131D).

            "text": "In influenza C and D viruses, the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein is uniquely responsible for viral attachment and entry, and hence HE function is receptor binding first and foremost. The same holds for the HEs of MHV-type murine betacoronaviruses (MuCoV) that mediate virion binding to O-Ac-sialoglycan-based attachment factors (Langereis et al., 2010), while S binds to the proteinaceous entry receptor CEACAM-1 (Peng et al., 2011). At the other end of the spectrum, in OC43 and HKU1, HE\u2019s sole remaining function is receptor destruction, with virion attachment to 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans exclusively assigned to S. For the animal \u03b21CoVs that retain a functional HE lectin domain, however, the role of HE is less obvious. On the one hand, HE might participate in attachment to increase virion binding avidity. On the other, its lectin domain may serve primarily to promote catalytic activity toward high-multivalency substrates by bringing the esterase in close proximity to and prolonged association with clustered glycotopes, in analogy with the carbohydrate-binding modules of cellular glycoside hydrolases (Boraston et al., 2004). In the latter case, the HE lectin CBS in the human lineage A \u03b2CoVs may have been lost to downregulate receptor-destroying activity. To study this, we compared soluble recombinant HEs of BCoV, OC43, and HKU1 for their relative enzymatic activity toward the monovalent substrate p-nitrophenol acetate (pNPA) and the multivalent substrate BSM. The latter glycoconjugate carries hundreds of O-linked glycans clustered in such densities to give the protein a filamentous bottlebrush appearance typical for mucins (Zappone et al., 2015). Whereas all three HEs showed comparable specific activities when assayed with pNPA (Figure 5\nA), those of OC43 and HKU1 were more than 250-fold less active than BCoV HE in receptor-destruction assays with BSM (Figure 5B). Inactivation of the BCoV HE lectin CBS through a F211A substitution reduced its esterase activity toward BSM to that of wild-type OC43 HE. Conversely, restoration of the OC43 HE lectin domain increased esterase activity to that of BCoV HE (see \u201cTREF,\u201d Figure 5B). Thus, BCoV and HCoV HEs indeed differ in their reactivity toward clustered receptors in consequence of the respective conservation or loss of lectin function.",

Of note, the observations for recombinant soluble HEs cannot be extrapolated one-to-one to virion-associated HEs, because in virus particles, HE esterase activity will be affected by S-mediated attachment to 9-O-Ac-Sias as well as by the close packing of HE molecules in the viral envelope. Serial dilutions of intact BCoV and OC43 virions, adjusted for pNPA esterase activity (Table S2), were therefore compared in solid-phase receptor-destruction assays with BSM (Figures 5C and 5D).

Conversely, the relative activity of virion-associated OC43 was increased at least in that destruction of receptors already became apparent at lower enzyme concentrations. (Figure 5C). To study whether these phenomena relate to the S protein and to S-mediated virion attachment to 9-O-Ac-Sias, we constructed recombinant murine coronaviruses (rMuCoVs) that express MuCoV S, which does not bind 9-O-Ac-Sias, in combination with either BCoV or OC43 HE. rMuCoV virions studded with OC43 HE lacked detectable esterase activity toward BSM. In contrast, the esterase activity of rMuCoVs expressing BCoV HE was 6- to 8-fold higher than that of wild-type BCoV virions (Figure 5C). Apparently, \u03b21CoV S proteins, by binding to 9-O-Ac-Sias negatively or positively, affect HE esterase activity in BCoV and OC43 virions, respectively, depending on whether or not the HE lectin domain is functional. Most strikingly, BCoV and OC43 virions differed in the extent to which receptors were depleted. The soluble HEs of OC43 and BCoV, despite their difference in enzyme activity, destroyed all O-Ac-Sias as detectable by sp-LBA. BCoV virions destroyed 95% of the receptors after 24 hr incubation, which increased to 98% after 48 hr (Figure 5D). For OC43 virions, the effect was more pronounced such that after 24 hr only 85% of the receptors were destroyed. The remaining receptors were resistant even to continued incubation (Figure 5D). The data suggest that, in the context of the virion, the absence of a functional HE lectin domain results not only in reduced enzyme activity toward clustered receptors, but also prohibits cleavage of particular receptor populations. As these \u201cprotected\u201d receptor populations are readily depleted by soluble OC43 HE (Figures 5B\u20135D), their resistance to cleavage by OC43 virions suggests that they are inaccessible to HEs when embedded in the viral envelope and in the presence of S.",

            "text": "The data prompt a model in which the susceptibility of populations of clustered receptors to cleavage depends on (1) their accessibility, as determined by the distance by which they extend from a fixed surface\u2014the bottom of the ELISA well in our artificial system and, for example, the host cell membrane in vivo\u2014and (2) the considerable difference in height between S and HE (20 and 8 nm, respectively), with the CBSs of S and those of HE esterase domains separated by a distance of up to 15 nm (Figure 5E). S-mediated virion attachment to a 9-O-Ac-sialylated surface would bring the HE catalytic site in proximity of some clustered receptors (which would explain the stimulating effect of S on HE esterase activity in the case of OC43 virions, but not observed for rMuCoV-OC43 HE+) but at the same time would keep the virus-associated enzyme at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d from other receptor populations, readily accessible to soluble HEs (which would explain the inhibiting effect of S on esterase activity in the case of BCoV virions and the apparent lack thereof in the case of rMuCoV-BCoV HE+) (Figures 5C and 5D). Thus, a distinction arises between clustered receptor populations that come within immediate reach of the HE esterase and that therefore would be cleaved by virion-associated HE as efficiently as by soluble HE and those that are kept out of reach of virion-associated HE as a result of S-mediated receptor-binding and that are therefore cleaved at strongly reduced rates or even rendered non-cleavable unless HE is provided with a functional lectin domain (Figure 6\n). By virions grasping on to multivalent sialoglycoconjugates via the HE receptor-binding sites and \u201cdrawing them in\u201d closer to the surface of the envelope, clustered receptors would yet become available to the HE esterase domain (Figure 6). Such a mechanism may be promoted by cooperativity among adjacent HE molecules and, membrane fluidity permitting, possibly even lead to redistribution of surface projections in the viral envelope, resulting in displacement of spikes, local recruitment of HEs, and formation of a \u201creceptor-destruction patch.\u201d Saliently, some receptor populations may be completely resistant to destruction even by virion-associated HEs with a functional lectin domain, such as the 2% of detectable O-Ac-Sias remaining after 48 hr of incubation with BCoV (Figure 5D). It is tempting to speculate that under natural conditions, the distinction between decoy and entry receptors is made by default on basis of their accessibility to cleavage by virion-associated HE.",

            "text": "We showed that OC43\u2014after its zoonotic introduction\u2014has been under incessant selective pressure to adapt to the sialoglycome of the human host. HE-associated receptor binding was selected against, largely lost early on, and ultimately lost altogether through an accumulation of mutations in the lectin domain over a period of decades. In result, the balance between virion attachment and catalytically driven virion elution was reset, apparently to meet the specific requirements for optimal replication in human airways and to allow the virus in this particular niche to distinguish between decoys marked for destruction and functional receptors that should be preserved for cell entry. This view is reinforced by our observation that HCoV-HKU1, another respiratory lineage A \u03b2CoV of humans, followed a convergent evolutionary path and also lost HE-mediated receptor binding. We offer that differences in the sialoglycomes of bovids and humans, such as in the local expression, structure, and density of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates, may pose incompatibilities during cross-species transmission of OC43 and BCoV and that the respective loss or preservation of HE-mediated receptor binding contributes to the host tropism of these viruses. This said, comparative sialoglycomics is still in its infancy, humans and bovids have not been studied for differences in O-Ac-sialoglycan expression in any detail, and the precise sialoglycan-based constraints that selected for the particular traits of the animal and human \u03b2CoVs therefore remain to be identified. At any rate, our findings do reveal an as yet unappreciated aspect of lineage A \u03b2CoV adaptation to humans. Of broader relevance, they provide a general paradigm for dynamic, catalysis-driven virus-sialoglycan interactions in relation to host selectivity. This notion is supported by observations for influenza A viruses, where neuraminidase (NA) activity toward multivalent substrates varies with differences in the length of the stalk domain and positively correlates with NA size (Castrucci and Kawaoka, 1993, Els et al., 1985), where NA catalytic activity is modulated by the absence or presence of a second Sia-binding site (Uhlendorff et al., 2009, Varghese et al., 1997) and where changes in NA stalk length and NA lectin affinity have been implicated in host specificity (Blumenkrantz et al., 2013, Castrucci and Kawaoka, 1993, Lai et al., 2012, Li et al., 2014, Matrosovich et al., 1999, Munier et al., 2010, Uhlendorff et al., 2009, Varghese et al., 1997). These observations can be readily interpreted in the context of our data and model proposed.",

The resulting constructs encode chimeric proteins comprised of the HE ectodomain fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain, with the domains separated by a thrombin cleavage site. The fusion proteins were either expressed in an enzymatically active form (HE+) or rendered inactive through a catalytic Ser-to-Ala substitution (HE0). Plasmids coding for OC43 NL/A/2005 and OC43 NL/B/2005 HE were constructed through site-directed mutagenesis of the OC43 USA/1967 HE expression vector using the Q5 kit (New England Biolabs). For lectin affinity and esterase activity assays, HE-Fcs were produced by transient expression in HEK293T cells and purified from cell culture supernatants by protein A affinity chromatography and low pH elution as described (Zeng et al., 2008). For crystallization, OC43 NL/A/2005 HE+-Fc was expressed in HEK293 GnTI(\u2212) cells and purified by protein A affinity chromatography, followed by on-the-beads thrombin cleavage as described (Zeng et al., 2008). Beads were pelleted, and the HE ectodomain in the supernatant was concentrated to \u223c15 mg/mL. HE genes from OC43 field strains were RT-PCR amplified with OC43 viral RNA, directly isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates (van de Pol et al., 2006) as a template, and their sequences were used to construct codon-optimized versions.",

Functional HE lectin CBSs are indicated by black holes (only one shown per HE dimer for reasons of simplicity). Also shown schematically are membrane-anchored (bottom) and non-anchored (top) mucin-type glycoconjugates of bottle-brush filamentous appearance with clustered receptors (9-O-Ac-Sias, red dots) arranged in linear arrays and with absence of red dots indicating receptor-destruction. The model, based on the size difference between S and HE, visualizes how loss of HE lectin function might alter virion-associated receptor-destroying activity, reducing the specific activity of virions as well as the rate and selectivity of receptor destruction. In virions with lectin-deficient HEs, clustered substrates will be largely kept at a distance from the HE esterase catalytic pocket as a result of S-glycoconjugate interaction. In contrast, HEs with intact lectin CBS may draw in portions of the glycoconjugates (or will draw the virion-associated HEs toward them), aided by cooperativity of binding between adjacent HEs within the viral envelope. Thus, clustered glycotopes become fixed within reach of the esterase catalytic sites and receptor destruction is promoted.",
