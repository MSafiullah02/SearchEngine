The association between potential risk factors and PeV detection was examined using mixed-effects logistic regression with the child entered as a random effect to account for repeated measurements. Risk factors considered were age (categorized as 0\u2013<3 months, 3\u2013<6 months, 6\u2013<12 months, 12\u201324 months), sex, exclusive breastfeeding, older siblings in the household, childcare attendance (none/informal/formal), season of PeV detection, and season of birth. Given the strong association between breastfeeding and childcare with age, both breastfeeding-by-age and childcare-by-age interaction terms were included in the models. All variables (except sex) were analyzed as time-varying variables. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted. In multivariable analyses, all variables were included in the regression models.",

Diverse PeV genotypes circulated in the community, with distinct seasonal peaks and genotype transitioning during summer and early autumn. Prolonged PeV shedding was from sequential infections with different genotypes rather than single infections, suggesting limited heterotypic protection. A sharp increase in PeV-A3 detections in cohort children coincided with a PeV-A3\u2013related sepsis outbreak in Australian infants where both sets of strains clustered phylogenetically [19]. However, infections in cohort children were either community-managed or asymptomatic in nature with symptom association confounded by high viral codetection rates.",

This coincided with the outbreak of PeV-A3\u2013associated sepsis in Australian infants [5, 19], and aligns with the predicted timing of a genomic recombination event leading to a more virulent phenotype [28]. Nevertheless, in our cohort PeV-A3 was not associated with severe symptoms, even when detected during the outbreak period or within the high-risk first 3 months of life. Case-control studies [32] and the sharp increase in PeV infections after age 3 months in our cohort suggest maternal antibody protection against PeV-related disease early in life. Thus, emergence of a novel recombinant PeV-A3 strain and declining PeV-A3 neutralizing antibodies in women of childbearing age at a population level may contribute to the biennial outbreaks in Australian infants [12, 32].",

First, the ORChID study was conducted in an urban, subtropical setting and most enrolled families were socioeconomically advantaged with higher rates of early age childcare attendance [22]. While the findings are valid, they may not be entirely generalizable to other populations. Second, the study relied upon parents diligently recording symptoms and collecting samples. Although completion rates were excellent for such a demanding study, not all diaries and swabs were returned. Finally, the 2 genotyping regions used in this study are highly conserved within the genome and may not reflect the true genetic diversity shown by the PeV-A3 recombinant variant associated with sepsis [28]. The sharp increase in ORChID PeV-A3 cases observed during the first PeV-A3 outbreak [19] suggests this recombinant variant was circulating within the community.",

Prolonged PeV shedding is from sequential infections with different genotypes rather than a single virus episode. Annual outbreaks occurred in the summer/autumn months with the severe disease\u2013associated PeV-A3 succeeding PeV-A1 as the predominant strain in the 2013\u20132014 season, but it and other PeV infections were typically asymptomatic or associated with mild ARI or AGE symptoms. Despite participants being predominantly from advantaged families, which may limit the extrapolation of findings to lower socioeconomic settings, these observations illustrate the value of unselected, high-resolution longitudinal community-based cohort studies helping to identify the overall epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical features associated with infection rather than focusing exclusively upon the few cases with severe disease.",
