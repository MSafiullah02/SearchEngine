An initial study was performed to confirm the virulence of MARV-Ang. In this first study, 3 macaques (control animals 1\u02133) were inoculated, by intramuscular injection, with 1000 pfu of MARV-Ang (provided by P. Rollin, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA). The MARV-Ang strain used was originally obtained in 2005 from serum samples from a fatally infected human [15] and was passed twice in Vero cells. After the initial study to confirm the virulence of MARV-Ang, the second study evaluated the utility of rNAPc2 as a postexposure treatment modality. The regimen followed was identical to that described elsewhere for ZEBOV infection [10]. In brief, 9 animals were exposed to 1000 pfu of MARV-Ang by means of intramuscular injection. Of these 9 animals, 6 animals (subjects 1\u02136) were treated with rNAPc2 by subcutaneous injection (\u223c30 \u00b5g/kg body weight, once daily; obtained previously from Corvas International), beginning \u223c10 min after viral challenge and continuing to 14 days after exposure to MARV-Ang. Three macaques served as experimental control animals (4\u02136) and received an equivalent volume of sterile PBS in accordance with the same regimen used for the rNAPc2-treated animals. Blood samples were collected before challenge and on days 3, 6, 10, and 14 after challenge; blood samples also were collected at the time of death, when possible.",

To investigate the pathogenic potential of MARV-Ang, 3 rhesus macaques (control animals 1\u20133) were experimentally infected, by intramuscular injection, with 1000 pfu of MARV-Ang. Results of previous studies that used other strains of MARV for infection of rhesus macaques and similar experimental conditions (i.e., subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of doses estimated to be between 500 and 10,000 pfu) have suggested that most rhesus macaques should begin showing clinical evidence of infection around day 4 or 5 and usually die between days 9 and 12 after challenge [6, 18, 22]. However, in this initial pilot study, disease appeared to progress more rapidly: all 3 animals began to show clinical signs of illness by day 3 (table 1). Characteristic features of MARV infection, including fever, cutaneous rashes, lymphopenia, and/or elevations in circulating levels of enzymes associated with organ dysfunction, were prominent in all animals by day 6. Thrombocytopenia, which is a prominent feature of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) in nonhuman primates [9, 10, 19, 23, 24], was not as prevalent in these animals. However, modest declines in levels of platelets (by 30%\u201340%), which is consistent with findings in other MARV studies of macaques [22], were seen at day 6 after infection. Decreases in plasma levels of protein C and concomitant increases in plasma levels of d-dimers were observed in the MARV-Ang-infected macaques but did not appear to be as marked as previously described for ZEBOV-infected macaques [9, 10]. Increased levels of TF transcripts were detected in PBMCs of the MARV-Ang-infected macaques but appeared to develop later in the disease course than has been reported for ZEBOV-infected macaques [9, 10]. All 3 of the MARV-infected animals succumbed to challenge; 1 macaque died on day 7 (control animal 2) and 2 macaques died on day 8 (control animals 1 and 3).",

However, the liver appeared to be a bit more affected by MARV-Ang (higher organ infectivity titers and more evidence of necrosis and inflammation) than has been observed in MARV Musoke-infected animals (T.W.G., unpublished data) and much more involved than the liver in ZEBOV-infected macaques [19, 23]. In brief, the livers were severely reticulated and discolored (figure 1A). Histologic findings included some hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis, with occasional neutrophilic and monocytic inflammation (figure 1B), in most of these animals. Although there is a significant paucity of immunohistochemical data from tissues of humans and nonhuman primates infected with MARV, the distribution of antigen in these macaques was consistent with findings reported for a human case of MARV infection (strain Ravn) [28]. Immunohistochemical staining for MARV antigens was particularly prominent in the liver (figure 1C) and splenic red pulp of all the animals. Similarly, organ infectivity titration showed that the liver and spleen had particularly high loads of infectious MARV-Ang, with mean titers of 9.1 and 8.8 log10 pfu/g, respectively, for untreated control animals. Mean organ infectivity titers for MARV-Ang in other tissues ranged from 5.3 to 8.4 log10 pfu/g (data not shown). Immunopositive staining was prominent in hepatocytes (figure 1C) and Kupffer cells in liver and also in monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts in most tissues examined. In addition, some animals showed other lesions consistent with findings for the human case of MARV infection, including viral infection of adrenal cortical and medullary cells (figure 1D) and pancreatic islet cells (figure 1E).",

Increased levels of TF mRNA transcripts were noted in the PBMCs of the cohort of 5 rNAPc2-treated nonsurvivors and in all the control animals by day 3 (figure 4C), whereas increased levels of TF transcripts were not observed in the rNAPc2-treated survivor (subject 3) at any sampling point.

During the height of this outbreak, interest in evaluating the potential of rNAPc2 as a postexposure treatment for MHF was expressed by a number of international health care organizations. This interest was driven by studies of rhesus macaques that showed that the TF-pathway inhibitor rNAPc2 had some postexposure efficacy against EHF and because rNAPc2 has been safely used in a variety of medical applications [13, 14]. In the current proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the efficacy of rNAPc2 as a postexposure treatment for MARV-Ang hemorrhagic fever by administering rNAPc2 to rhesus macaques shortly after challenge with MARV-Ang. The results of this study (17% survival; 1.7-day increase in mean time to death) were not as impressive as the results obtained in studies of ZEBOV-infected rhesus macaques treated with rNAPc2 (33% survival; 3.4-day increase in mean time to death), even though the study design was identical. Nonetheless, survival and a beneficial effect were achieved in an otherwise uniformly lethal model of virus challenge.",

TF was up-regulated in the MARV-Ang-infected macaques; however, levels of TF were not as striking as those noted in ZEBOV-infected macaques [9, 10]. Differences in levels of TF may have contributed to the reduced efficacy of rNAPc2 in the MARV-Ang-infected macaques, compared with ZEBOV-infected macaques. rNAPc2 acts by inhibiting the TF/factor VIIa pathway; thus, if TF is not as important in the developing coagulopathy of MARV-Ang infection in macaques, then blocking the TF pathway may not have as much of an impact on mitigating the disease. Further studies are needed in order to systematically dissect these differences in TF production.",

In particular, the deposition of polymerized fibrin, which is a prominent pathologic finding in tissues of ZEBOV-infected macaques [9, 10, 23], was less frequently observed in tissues of the MARV-Ang- infected macaques. Further differences include the degree of hepatocyte infection and of necrosis and inflammation of the liver, which were more prominent in the MARV-Ang-infected animals than has been reported for ZEBOV-infected macaques. In fact, mean virus titers in the livers of the MARV-Ang-infected macaques exceeded 9.0 log10 pfu/g, which is nearly 2.0 log10 pfu/g more than that typically seen in EBOV-infected macaques [19, 33]. In the MARV-Ang-infected macaques, the coagulation disorders may have been exacerbated more by the decreased synthesis of coagulation proteins, due to severe hepatocellular necrosis, than by thrombocytopenia or induction of the TF pathway of blood coagulation. rNAPc2 has no known ability to protect hepatocyte function, so the lower efficacy of rNAPc2 against MARV-Ang infection may be related to the increased liver damage seen in the MARV-Ang-infected macaques, versus that seen in ZEBOV-infected macaques.",

One consideration regarding our studies of macaques is the passage history of the virus strain used in this study, versus the passage history of MARV strains used in other studies. The passage history of MARV-Ang is low (i.e., 2 passages from human serum). The best direct comparison is to the Ravn strain of MARV, which also has a low passage history (2 passages from human serum), as shown when injected into 3 rhesus macaques [6]. In the study of MARV Ravn, which used a higher challenge dose of 10,000 pfu, 1 of 3 animals survived; the other animals died on days 8 and 11 after challenge. These results suggest that passage history may not explain the increased virulence of MARV-Ang relative to other MARV strains.",

Although the genetic disparity between MARV strains in the lineage containing MARV-Ang is indeed minimal, studies have shown that even single-\u03b1mino acid changes can alter the cell tropism and viral pathogenicity of a number of viruses, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [35, 36], dengue virus [37], severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [38], and human immunodeficiency virus [39].",

Although the results of this study were not as promising as results of a similar study using rNAPc2 to treat ZEBOV-infected rhesus macaques [10], they are nonetheless encouraging and provide a possible treatment option for MHF. Survival of 1 rNAPc2-treated animal challenged with MARV-Ang was associated with attenuated coagulation and proinflammatory responses. This finding is consistent with the survival of rNAPc2-treated, ZEBOV-infected macaques [10] and with ZEBOV-infected macaques treated with recombinant human activated protein C [40]. Moreover, in severe sepsis in humans, survival has been correlated with biomarkers that include plasma levels of protein C [41] and/ or IL-6 [42]. These findings support the concept of targeting the underlying mechanisms of illness as identified through studies of pathogenesis.",
