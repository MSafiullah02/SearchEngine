The platform takes advantage of baculoviruses' natural propensity to infect insect cells. In nature, there are more than 500 different types of baculoviruses, all of which have a host range restricted to invertebrates [9] . In the laboratory and for manufacturing purposes, the most commonly used baculovirus is Autographa californica multiple-capsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), a virus with a double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 134 kb [10] . The large size of its genome gives the baculovirus ample capacity to accommodate large amounts of foreign DNA, including multiple genes, an advantage over other expression vectors such as vaccinia and adenovirus [2] . To begin the BEVS process, a recombinant baculovirus is constructed comprising the desired gene(s) of interest (GOI) (Fig. 1) . First, the GOI is cloned into a transfer plasmid, typically behind the strong polyhedrin or p10 promoter that can drive protein expression to high levels in insect cells [11, 12] ; notably, these promoters are not very active in E. coli and, therefore, can be stable expression cassettes. The GOI is flanked by AcMNPV DNA, e.g. the polyhedrin promoter on one side and a portion of the essential gene ORF1629 on the other. Insect cells are then co-transfected with a mixture of the transfer plasmid and parental AcMNPV DNA that has been linearized such that the parental polyhedrin gene and portion of ORF1629 are missing, rendering it non-infectious [13] . The plasmid and parental DNA undergo homologous recombination to generate de novo recombinant baculoviruses. These baculoviruses are plated and individual plaques purified to isolate a single, pure plaque of recombinant baculovirus. This plaque is subsequently passaged through multiple rounds of insect cell infection to generate a high-titer stock and establish a working virus bank (WVB) that can be utilized for protein production.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 48, "end": 51, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 52, "end": 54, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 55, "end": 58, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 59, "end": 62, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 63, "end": 66, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 67, "end": 70, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 291, "end": 294, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 527, "end": 531, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 746, "end": 749, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1058, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1534, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 869, "end": 877, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "The BEVS platform: How it works from cloning to protein production"}, {"text": "For manufacturing purposes, it is important that WVBs be stable and retain integrity as virus passages are scaled up.

Long-term stability of the baculovirus is an important consideration if large-scale protein production is envisioned. Once a high-titer WVB has been established it is used to infect insect cells and stimulate protein production. Cells are seeded in culture flasks (for small-scale production) or bioreactors (for large-scale production) and the WVB added to infect the insect cells when they are in their logarithmic growth phase. The baculoviruses reprogram the cellular machinery to produce the recombinant protein(s).

These features as well as other important considerations about the technology are discussed below. The choice of an expression system for manufacturing is a complex decision that must balance many facets, including attainment of specific product features, the demands of the therapeutic indication, and the needs of the manufacturer. Comparisons of the BEVS platform to other expression systems such as bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells and plants have been made and are useful to consider when selecting a platform [2] [3] [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 579, "end": 582, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 583, "end": 586, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 587, "end": 590, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 55, "end": 61, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "BEVS platform features: Advantages and considerations"}, {"text": "BEVS employs recombinant technology, giving researchers and product developers a level of control over the production process that is not possible with other techniques. A good example is found with vaccine manufacturing. Traditionally, vaccines are made by cultivating large volumes of the pathogen against which protection is desired to generate the \"raw materials\" required for the product. This can be accomplished by infecting substrates such as embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian cells, both of which are used to manufacture the majority of the vaccines recommended for routine immunization [1, 17] . The pathogen is either weakened and administered live as a live attenuated vaccine, or is killed or inactivated with reagents such as formalin or heat prior to being formulated into vaccine. These methods yield safe and effective vaccines; however, important shortcomings have been observed. The first concerns specificity. For example, traditional influenza vaccine production involves virus propagation in eggs. As influenza viruses are RNA viruses, they have a tendency to mutate to optimize their Figure 1 . The BEVS platform. The BEVS platform is an efficient process for producing a wide variety of proteins in a streamlined manner. A gene of interest (GOI) is cloned into a transfer plasmid behind a strong promoter (green arrow) and surrounded by DNA homologous to the parent baculovirus (yellow and green boxes). A library of recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) can be made using standard cloning techniques and varying the GOI. Construction of an rBV takes eight days. To generate protein, the appropriate rBV is scaled up (taking on average two to five weeks) and used to infect insect cells, which programs the cells to generate large quantities of recombinant protein that can subsequently be purified to high levels using standard techniques. A single insect cell line can be used to produce all proteins. Protein production averages three to five weeks and yields highly pure, biologically active products.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 600, "end": 603, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 604, "end": 607, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1111, "end": 1119, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Recombinant technology offers speed, specificity and control"}, {"text": "growth [18] . Generally, the changes introduced into the virus sequence have little impact on vaccine efficacy. However, since the virus receptors for birds and mammals differ, these changes can be meaningful, and it has been documented that in some cases the changes have rendered egg-based influenza vaccines ineffective [19] . The BEVS process does not involve pathogen growth and, therefore, avoids this complication. Rather than cultivate a pathogen to collect \"raw materials\", a recombinant baculovirus is constructed that codes for the antigen required for protection. Since accommodations for growth do not need to be made, the antigen can be an exact sequence match to the human pathogen. This has the potential to solve the ineffectiveness observed for some egg-adapted vaccines as was described by Skowronski et al. (2014) [19] . Moreover, specific point mutations can be introduced to enhance features such as stability. For example, it has recently been reported that purified hemagglutinin protein, the protective antigen in influenza vaccines, appears unstable in the SRID potency assay due to crosslinking of specific cysteine residues in the protein [20] . By mutating these cysteine residues to non-thiol residues, it was possible to prevent cross-linking and enhance stability [21] . A second shortcoming with traditional vaccine manufacturing is process length. Again, influenza serves as a good example. Influenza epidemics occur every year and annual influenza vaccination is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [22] . In addition, pandemic outbreaks occur occasionally, the most recent of which was the 2009 H1N1 swine flu (A/California/07/2009) [23, 24] . Timeliness of vaccine manufacture is critical to ensure that adequate vaccine supply is available. Egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing takes on average about six months, as the process of creating a high-producing, egg-adapted seed virus is slow [17] . This means that manufacturing of seasonal influenza vaccines must begin the winter prior to an epidemic, before that season's strain prevalence is definitively known, to guarantee adequate supply, and this has resulted in seasons where the available influenza vaccines have not matched the circulating influenza strains [25, 26] . Moreover, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) reported that pandemic influenza vaccine in 2009 was not readily available until after the pandemic peaked, a major concern for public health and safety (www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ PCAST-Influenza-Vaccinology-Report.pdf). PCAST identified recombinant technology and freedom from virus growth and egg adaptation as the solution to this problem. BEVS-derived influenza vaccines do not require seed viruses and can be produced in as little as 45 days [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 7, "end": 11, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 323, "end": 327, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 834, "end": 838, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1171, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1300, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1564, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1699, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1700, "end": 1703, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1962, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2285, "end": 2289, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2290, "end": 2293, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2853, "end": 2856, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Recombinant technology offers speed, specificity and control"}, {"text": "In addition to specificity and speed, recombinant technology offers advantages with respect to purity and product design. With respect to purity, recombinant products are free of pathogens, eggs and many chemicals (such as formalin and antibiotics) that can be undesirable or allergenic [27] . For product design, recombinant techniques make it possible to engineer proteins with desired features, such as fusion proteins that increase immunogenicity or include multiple antigens and truncated proteins with deleted domains to improve yields and ease purification [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . One example of this application is the antigen used in Provenge immunotherapy. The antigen is a fusion glycoprotein consisting of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) and is used to stimulate autologous antigen presenting cells [33] . The GM-CSF activates the antigen presenting cells and enhances cell viability while the PAP serves as the target antigen. Another example is the Cervarix \u00ae vaccine manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. The vaccine is a bivalent virus-like particle (VLP) comprised of the human papillomavirus L1 proteins (strains 16 and 18) . By expressing C-terminally truncated L1 proteins, the manufacturers are able to prevent intracellular VLP self-assembly, which would complicate purification. Instead, the L1 subunit proteins are purified to a high degree and VLP assembly is achieved in vitro [28] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 291, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 564, "end": 568, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 569, "end": 573, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 574, "end": 578, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 579, "end": 583, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 584, "end": 588, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 882, "end": 886, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1207, "text": "16 and 18)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1469, "end": 1473, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Recombinant technology offers speed, specificity and control"}, {"text": "The BEVS platform has inherent safety measures built in that are attractive from a regulatory perspective.

People are exposed to baculoviruses daily by consuming fresh vegetables. For instance, a serving of coleslaw may contain hundreds of millions of baculoviruses [34] . Baculovirus vectors have also been explored as gene therapy vectors.

There are very few adventitious agents that can replicate in both insect and mammalian cells. A notable exception is arboviruses that can be transmitted to humans via insect bites and can cause complications such as encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever [39] . To mitigate this risk, cells from non-biting insects such as the fall armyworm and cabbage looper have been used with BEVS as noted above. Nonetheless, adventitious agents have been detected in some insect cell lines. For instance, the Trichoplusia ni High Five cell line, BTI-TN-5B1-4, used to make Cervarix \u00ae , was found to be latently infected with an Alphanodavirus that was induced by recombinant baculovirus infection [40] . In addition, other insect cell lines, such as those generated from Drosophila melanogaster, have been shown to harbor innate retroelements derived from retroviruses that could potentially be infectious [41] . More recently, a possible insect-specific virus Sf-rhabdovirus was identified in Spodoptera frugiperda cells [42] . Although studies showed that this virus could not enter or replicate in human cell lines and, therefore, is unlikely to be a risk, novel cell lines will most likely need to be characterized and monitored for the presence of this virus as they are for nodaviruses, retroviruses and others.

Qualifying a cell line is no small feat. It can take years of work to adequately ensure purity and safety in addition to high productivity.

Insect cells are grown in suspension, so if the cells and baculoviruses have been optimized for large scale and multiple passages, the culture size is only limited by the size of the bioreactor. For example, expresSF+ cells have been used to produce recombinant proteins at scales ranging from two to 21 000 L [44] . The cost of goods for BEVS production is largely dependent on capital costs and yields. As discussed by Cox (2012), vast global bioreactor capacity (~500 000 L) already exists and presents the opportunity to minimize the investment needed to establish BEVS manufacturing facilities [1] . Moreover, opportunities for yield improvements are abundant and include genetic and fermentation-based approaches; these are described elsewhere [1] . Unlike some other production facilities, BEVS facilities can be multi-purpose and used to produce a variety of BEVS-derived products, especially when disposable or single-use technology is employed [45] . This is because a single cell line can be used for production of different products. This feature is especially meaningful for regions of the world where limited manufacturing capacity exists. A single BEVS facility could, for example, be used to produce vaccines for diseases endemic to a region and quickly be converted to produce pandemic influenza vaccine in an emergency.

Nine different rAAV serotypes (1-9) are most commonly used for rAAV-based gene therapy, each serotype with a different propensity for tissue-specific infection and infection kinetics [54] . Recombinant AAV-based gene therapies have been in development and shown promise for some time; however, a major limitation to their implementation had been the inability to scale up the manufacturing process to produce sufficient quantities of rAAVs.
