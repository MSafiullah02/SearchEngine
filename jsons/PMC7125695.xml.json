The potential for contamination is large because there are over 100 human-specific viruses present in sewage and viruses are shed in feces of infected humans in concentrations on the order of 105 to 1011 viruses per gram (Bosch, 1998). Bovine viruses also have been detected in environmental waters and have most commonly been used to trace contamination from cattle farms (Fong et al., 2005, Ahmed et al., 2010), and suggest potential for transmission to cattle exposed to contaminated water sources. Virus contamination can impact groundwater quality (Abbaszadegan et al., 2003, Bradbury et al., 2013) as well as surface water quality (Tani et al., 1995, Jiang and Chu, 2004, Fong and Lipp, 2005).",

            "text": "Sources of human viruses into environmental waters are limited, although the degree of contamination can be strongly variable in both time and space (Rutsch et al., 2008). Sources include: treated wastewater effluent, partially treated wastewater effluent (from \u201cblending\u201d events), combined sewer overflows (CSO), sanitary sewer overflows (SSO), leaking sanitary and sewer lines, lateral pipes for public and private connections, and misconnected sanitary sewer lines. Septic systems can also introduce viruses to environmental waters when properly functioning (Alhajjar et al., 1988, DeBorde et al., 1998) or during periods of system failure (Borchardt et al., 2011). In addition, authorized application of septic system effluent to the land surface is common for routine septic system maintenance (WDNR, 2001, http://www.legis.state.wi.us/rsb/code/nr/nr113.pdf). Treated wastewater, CSOs, and SSOs are typically discharged directly to surface water systems, while leaking sanitary sewer lines and septic systems discharge to the groundwater system, and ultimately may travel laterally and be transported to surface waters. Bovine viruses are released to the environment in cattle manure in holding ponds, storage areas, or pastures, and are often widely distributed in agricultural areas when manure is land-applied for crop fertilization. Viruses in land-applied septage and manure can move by overland flow or drain tiles to surface waters (Fong and Lipp, 2005) and viruses can infiltrate soil to reach groundwater where they can be pumped back to the surface from wells, become inactivated, or travel through shallow groundwater and discharge as baseflow to surface water systems. In surface water, viruses can remain suspended and be transported with currents or be deposited into sediments which can act as a reservoir from which viruses can persist and be resuspended under certain environmental conditions (Bosch, 1998).",

Potentially influential factors include temperature, desiccation, UV light exposure, inactivation by other microorganisms, hydrologic flow conditions, filtration or adsorption in porous media, adsorption to sediments, and deposition and resuspension in sediments. Human and bovine viruses do not replicate outside of their host, so once in the environment, consideration of survival and inactivation is important, but not growth. Due to the small size of viruses and the potentially long survival time in the environment, travel times in groundwater of months to years are relevant for delivery of viruses to drinking water wells or surface water resources. Survival in surface water is likely shorter than that in groundwater because of UV exposure, higher temperatures (depending on the time of year and location), and the opportunity for more interactions with other organisms that can inactivate viruses (Meixell et al., 2013).",

With changes in flow from rainfall or snowmelt, contamination levels of many constituents will also change. In addition, diel changes in UV light exposure and temperature in a river likely result in diel variability in virus survival. This suggests that proper characterization of viruses must be accomplished by sampling in a hydrologically and temporally relevant manner over extended periods of time, but this can be difficult. Large volumes of water (typically > 100 L) must be filtered and some filtration methods require pH adjustment of sample water before filtration. Because of these technical details, previous river sampling for viruses has commonly been limited to collection of large volume grab samples over relatively short periods of time (Noble and Fuhrman, 2001, Jiang and Chu, 2004, Fong et al., 2005, Jenkins et al., 2005, Aslan et al., 2011). Hydrologically relevant samples require sampling through low flow periods as well as entire runoff periods to capture all components of the hydrograph including the first flush, rising flow, peak flow, and receding flow periods. Virus inactivation likely differs between daylight and non-daylight periods, suggesting that 24 h would be a reasonable sampling duration during low-flow periods.",

A third objective was to relate virus occurrence to hydrologic and climatic conditions. Results provide further understanding of primary factors that influence virus presence in rivers and could lead to improved watershed management decisions for minimizing human exposure to waterborne viruses.",

These sampling techniques require instantaneous flow measurements that are used to compute the volume of streamflow over time. Flow-weighted samples were collected by specifying the volume of streamflow between subsamples. The volume between subsamples varied by sampling period based on anticipated streamflow levels. With these methods, subsample collection frequency increases as streamflow increases. Runoff samples consisted of numerous 5 L subsamples to cover the entire event hydrograph (between 7 and 206 h sampling duration). Runoff-event sampling was initiated when water level became elevated above low flow, and sampling was ended after flow returned to near baseflow levels. Low-flow samples consisted of numerous 5 L subsamples collected over approximately 24 h. Exact sample volumes varied by sampling event (Table 1). Flow-weighted sampling allowed for straightforward total virus loading and unit-area loading computation as well as valid comparison among sampling locations.",

Remote telemetry allowed unattended operation for initiating and monitoring sampling. This allowed sample coverage of entire runoff events and extended low-flow periods without deploying field personnel. A variable-speed peristaltic pump was used to pump water from the stream into the sampling system with a tipping bucket flow meter to measure the flow rate. Flow rate was regulated to 1 L/min \u00b1 0.2 L/min with this system. Using a pH sensor and a second variable-speed peristaltic pump, dilute HCl (between 0.13 N and 0.5 N, depending on the site) was metered into the system, conditioning pH to levels of 6.75 \u00b1 0.25 for optimal virus recovery in the glass-wool filter. Each filter unit consisted of a prefilter (10-inch polypropylene string-wound filter cartridge (McMaster-Carr, Atlanta, GA), with a 10 \u03bcm nominal pore size) to remove coarse material and a glass-wool filter for primary virus capture (Lambertini et al., 2008, Millen et al., 2012). Filter units were housed inside a refrigerator and kept chilled throughout the sampling process. Three ball valves were used to direct flow between the bypass and the two filter units. A pressure transducer measured backpressure in the system, an indication of filter clogging. At a threshold pressure of 345 kPa (50 psi), the valves were triggered to direct flow to the second filter set.",

Variable selection began with the full model, and at each step one variable was removed or added. The variable that was removed or added was the one whose addition or removal did the most to reduce the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). If no such variable was found, then selection was considered complete.

Human enteric viruses are not uncommon contaminants in rivers located throughout the world and results from the present study for the Milwaukee River watershed proved to be no different. Forty nine percent of samples were human virus-positive. In comparison, reviewing more than two dozen published studies on human viruses in rivers, the occurrence rate typically reported for virus-positive samples was 30% to 80% (Kishida et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2013) and some studies report 100% of their river samples were virus positive. Samples from urban rivers in Barcelona, Spain and Rio Janeiro, Brazil (Calgua et al., 2013), the Ruhr and Rhine rivers in Germany (Hamza et al., 2009), and the Mille-Iles river in Quebec, Canada (Payment et al., 1988), were all positive for at least one type of human enteric virus; every sample of eight from the Maas and Waal rivers in the Netherlands contained four viruses: enterovirus, norovirus, reovirus, and rotavirus (Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2005). Virus concentrations in the rivers of the present study were on the order of tens to hundreds of genomic copies/L, at least two orders of magnitude lower than those measured in some other rivers. There are many reports of adenovirus or norovirus concentrations in rivers of 104\n genomic copies/L (Choi and Jiang, 2005, Hamza et al., 2009, Hamza et al., 2011, Fong et al., 2010, Kishida et al., 2012, Calgua et al., 2013), which is only one or two orders of magnitude lower than virus concentrations found in wastewater treatment plant influent (Fong et al., 2010, Bradbury et al., 2013), suggesting that these rivers are highly polluted. The rivers sampled for the current study in the Milwaukee region might have less fecal pollution because of the substantial efforts in the region to minimize wastewater contamination by constructing a deep tunnel system for holding wastewater during combined sewer overflow events (Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District). Another possible reason the Milwaukee River watershed virus concentrations were lower than previous studies is the sampling method. Previous studies on viruses in rivers used grab samples of various volumes, whereas the concentrations reported here are from flow-weighted samples collected over a minimum 24 hour period. This sampling method results in flow-weighted average concentrations while grab sampling could serendipitously reveal peak concentrations depending on the timing of sample collection.",

Recent studies on viruses in rivers mostly rely on testing by PCR, only a few have tested for viruses by culture methods. Culturable viruses have been reported in 30% to 100% of samples from rivers in Japan (Tani et al., 1995), Korea (Lee et al., 2013), Quebec, Canada (Payment et al., 1988) and Michigan, USA (Jenkins et al., 2005). Choi and Jiang (2005) found that 16% of 114 samples from two rivers in southern California were positive for adenoviruses by qPCR with concentrations as high as 104/L, yet none of these samples were culture positive on two cell lines, suggesting that the adenoviruses were inactivated. In the present study, culturable adenoviruses and enteroviruses were observed only during hydrologic events, never during low flow. This is likely due to increased sanitary sewer leakage or overflows during runoff events, but could also result from shorter transport time from contamination sources to sample location during runoff events allowing less time for inactivation by biotic and abiotic effects in the river.",

Both treatment methods could be virus contamination sources because neither are 100% effective in removal. Conventional septic systems can release viruses to groundwater (Alhajjar et al., 1988, Scandura and Sobsey, 1997), whereupon they can be transported to groundwater gaining reaches of streams and rivers. Wastewater tertiary treatment, the level required for wastewater plants in the study area, provides only four or lower log removal of viruses, which may result in virus concentrations in the effluent on the order of 104 per liter (Myrmel et al., 2006, Fong et al., 2010) to be released at discharge pipes into rivers. Upstream from the sampling sites, wastewater effluent is discharged from one treatment plant on Cedar Creek and 14 small community plants discharge to the Milwaukee River. Although the Milwaukee River sampling site is located upstream from where the City of Milwaukee discharges effluent, the river occasionally reverses flow direction under the effects of the Lake Michigan seiche, possibly carrying Milwaukee effluent upstream to the sample site. Consistent with the number of wastewater inputs, the Milwaukee River did have the highest percentage of virus-positive samples.",

These viruses must have originated from the extensive sanitary sewer system within the urban basin. Sanitary sewers are known to leak outward (i.e., exfiltration) (Rutsch et al., 2006), and viruses released underground in untreated wastewater are capable of reaching groundwater and traveling long distances in short time periods (Hunt et al., 2010, Hunt et al., 2014, Bradbury et al., 2013). Two routes for exfiltrated sewage to contaminate rivers are possible, via groundwater flow to gaining river reaches or by infiltration into storm sewers that have river outfalls (Sercu et al., 2011). The latter route, particularly under wet conditions, would provide a rapid direct conduit to river waters. Sauer et al. (2011) investigated separated stormwater sewers (i.e., not combined with sanitary sewers) in the Milwaukee urban area and found that among 45 stormwater outfalls, all were positive at least once for human Bacteroides, suggesting that underground wastewater contamination from breaches in the sanitary sewer infrastructure was widespread and moving to stormwater sewers. Sercu et al. (2009) similarly used human Bacteroides to identify wastewater contamination of storm drains in Santa Barbara, CA, and in subsequent work in the same city used rhodamine dye tracer experiments to provide convincing evidence that sanitary sewers were, indeed, hydrologically connected to deeper storm drains (Sercu et al., 2011).",

The difference in concentrations might be expected given the much higher population of humans compared to cattle in the river basins and that the sampling locations were far downstream of the most intensive agricultural areas, leaving time for settling or inactivation of bovine viruses before reaching the monitoring station. Four of the bovine viruses tested were undetected, probably because of low prevalence in the dairy herds in the basins.

Consistent with these studies, bovine viruses were detected in the Milwaukee and Cedar rivers, where approximately 50% of the land use in the basins is agricultural, including dairy farming. However, bovine viruses were also present in Underwood Creek, a heavily urbanized river. The hydrologic patterns of bovine viruses in this river were also unusual in that the occurrence frequency and concentration decreased during runoff events, suggesting a contamination point source being diluted by the higher river discharges. One possible point source is the Milwaukee County Zoo, where cattle are housed and stormwater overland flow passing through animal pens could enter a tributary of Underwood Creek located on zoo property. Another source is a large meat packing plant that processes 1800 cattle per day. While not located in the creek basin, the plant's wastewater moves through the same sanitary sewer network serving the entire region, leaving open the possibility for bovine virus leakage via the same route as for human viruses. And lastly, it is possible that the bovine rotavirus A primers and probe amplified the bovine-origin VP1 gene of the human-bovine reassortant vaccine, RotaTeq (Matthijnssens et al., 2010), which was licensed in the US just as the present study began in 2006. As it is administered orally, the vaccine might have been present in Milwaukee wastewater. The vaccine is now widely administered in the US, limiting the value of bovine rotavirus VP1 as a target specific to a bovine source.",

Interestingly, antecedent rainfall, precipitation intensity, maximum streamflow, and season were also important predictors for high concentrations of Cryptosporidium in Cedar and Underwood Creeks (Corsi et al., 2003). Broadly speaking, that precipitation is related to river fecal contamination should not be surprising, knowing the myriad routes water takes to reach river ways and the opportunities these present to contact and carry fecal contamination: overland flow, groundwater flow, stormwater discharges, combined and sanitary sewer overflow events, and sediment re-suspension. It is the specifics that are often lacking for modeling and predicting pathogen transport in watersheds (Ferguson et al., 2003).",

Rainfall or elevated river flow was associated with increased detection frequencies or increased virus concentrations at various sites in the area near Galveston, TX (Gerba et al., 1979), the Chicago area waterway system (Rijal et al., 2009), and the Atlamaha River, Georgia (Fong and Lipp, 2005). Rainfall did not increase virus levels in two rivers in southern California (Choi and Jiang, 2005), six river sites in Brisbane, Australia (Sidhu et al., 2012), and pathogen/virus levels even decreased during hydrologic events in the Grand River watershed, Ontario, Canada (Dorner et al., 2007). The reasons for this inconsistency are unknown; it could be related to site-specific factors such as hydromorphology, fecal contamination sources, and the epidemiology of viral infections at the times the studies were conducted. Another possibility is the variety of definitions by which the previous virus studies dealt with the precipitation predictor variables, primarily as a dichotomy (e.g., rainy season or dry season, rain or no rain, event or no event). For the present study, hourly radar-indicated precipitation data was available for each watershed and, adjusting for season, streamflow and precipitation-related variables were found to be the most important for describing variability of virus concentrations in the three study rivers. Perhaps as similarly specific data is measured in future studies, consistent patterns of precipitation effects on virus presence in rivers will emerge. For example, 10-day antecedent rainfall amount was negatively associated with human virus levels in the present study. Fong et al. (2005) observed a similar negative and significant association for human viruses and 30-day antecedent rainfall, suggesting that the association is not spurious and the mechanism should be identified and considered as future watershed models for viruses are developed.",

Another advantage is that the resulting data are flow-weighted average concentrations making it easy to compute accurate virus loading rates. Studies on pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria in rivers have typically relied on grab samples from which the resulting measured concentrations are multiplied by river discharge to calculate an instantaneous loading rate. Load can be better approximated from a load\u2013duration curve derived from nearly continuous monitoring of discharge at a gauging station and more frequent grab samples (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2001). For viruses, though, it is not practical to collect a sufficient number of grab samples for this approach; time constraints and cost of multiple samples per event are too limiting. If a sufficient number of grab samples are not collected, inaccuracies in load calculation are introduced by failing to account for streamflow-dependent changes in pathogen concentrations, that can vary substantially during an event hydrograph from rising limb to peak streamflow and recession (Krometis et al., 2007). The flow-weighted virus samplers avoided this problem. The primary disadvantage of this approach was that water quality data were collected at only three site locations; the samplers cannot be easily moved to alternative sampling locations. Resulting data represents all upstream processes influencing levels of viruses and other analytes, but without additional samplers, the variability in inputs and losses along discrete sections of the watershed length cannot be ascertained.",

Such a large difference suggests massive flushing of viruses from originating sources during events. A similar event effect, but not nearly of the same magnitude, was observed for bovine viruses in two of the three rivers. In contrast, for human viruses in Cedar Creek and bovine viruses in Underwood Creek, loading rates during low flow conditions were similar to loads during events, suggesting that in these rivers virus inputs were predominately more consistent sources. Identifying and mitigating virus inputs (i.e., fecal inputs) from these sources could quickly lead to water quality improvements in Cedar and Underwood Creeks during low flows.",

            "text": "Findings from the present study relating streamflow and precipitation to virus concentrations in Milwaukee-area rivers add further clarity to the emerging picture of the importance of the hydrologic cycle to pathogen transport and transmission of enteric infectious diseases. During periods of increased runoff when human virus concentrations become elevated in the Milwaukee River watershed, transmission could result from limited-contact recreational activities like wading, boating, and fishing. Participants in such activities in Chicago-area waters were found, using epidemiological methods, to have 46% to 50% increased risk for acute gastrointestinal illness (Dorevitch et al., 2012). In a similar study of recreational activities in the Chicago area waterway system using risk assessment methods, participants were at greatest risk for AGI recreating during wet weather (Rijal et al., 2009). Rivers are simply one link in the hydrologic cycle where pathogens can be measured and exposure can be assessed. During increased runoff periods in a heavily populated area with broad-scale movement of pathogens through the landscape, there may be other less obvious direct and indirect exposure routes that are responsible for a significant fraction of illness. In the Milwaukee area, Drayna et al. (2010) found that four days following rainfall of any amount, the number of children visiting a children's hospital emergency department for AGI treatment increased by 11%. Other studies have similarly linked heavy precipitation events with elevated AGI rates in Wisconsin (Uejio et al., 2014) and elsewhere (Curriero et al., 2001, Thomas et al., 2006). Recent downscaled climate models for the Milwaukee area predict that precipitation intensity and heavy precipitation events will increase to the point where daily rainfall depths of 7.6 and 10.2 cm occur twice as frequently by the mid 21st century as in the past (Vavrus and Behnke, 2013).",
