            "text": "Thailand is the world's important exporter of shrimp products, especially the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. At present, losses of shrimp production are caused by various viral diseases. One of the major causative agents is the yellow head virus (YHV) which causes extensive and rapid mortality in black tiger shrimp [1], [2]. YHV is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is classified as a member of Gill-associated virus, belonging to the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae in the order Nidovirales [3]. YHV genome is approximately 26 kb, containing four long open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2, and ORF3) [4], [5], [6]. The enveloped rod-shaped YHV particles are 150\u2013200 nm in length and 40\u201350 nm in diameter [1], [7]. The virion has prominent surface spikes and contains internal helical nucleocapsid [8], [9]. It contains three structural proteins, the transmembrane glycoproteins gp116 and gp64 are found in the viral envelope, and the nucleoprotein p20 [6], [10].",

            "text": "Recently, the mechanism of YHV transportation has been proposed. After YHV enters into the cell, it is transported via endosomal compartments [11], [12] and released its genome into the cytoplasm for replication. Then, the nucleocapsid is synthesized and transported to the ER-Golgi compartment where the envelope is formed [2], [13]. Finally, the enveloped viral particle is exocytosed at the plasma membrane. However, this exocytosis process of YHV out of the cells is not well understood. Normally, enveloped viruses are budded at the membrane in order to generate the envelope that surrounded the nucleocapsid [14]. In this process, the nucleocapsid is wrapped in a cellular membrane containing virus-specific envelope proteins. The viral envelope protein serves to target the host cell receptor [15]. Some viruses bud at the plasma membrane (PM), whereas others are assembled and budded at intracellular membranes along the secretory pathway such as the nuclear envelope, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), endosomes, intermediate or pre-Golgi compartment, Golgi cisternae and the trans-Golgi-network (TGN) [16]. However, the cytoplasmic transportation of viral genome or viral particle to plasma membrane requires the host proteins.",

            "text": "One of the cellular proteins that is involved in intracellular trafficking process is Rab11. Rab11 is a small GTPase protein belongs to the Ras superfamily, whose function is in transportation of the vesicles through the TGN [17], apical recycling of endosomes [18] and the perinuclear recycling of endosomal compartments before redirecting the vesicular cargo back to the apical plasma membrane. The Rab GTPase protein acts as molecular switches that shuffle between two conformational states, the GTP bound \u2018active\u2019 form and the GDP-bound \u2018inactive\u2019 form. In the active form, Rab protein is associated with membranes by hydrophobic geranylgeranyl groups at the C-terminal and recruited the specific effector molecules such as sorting adaptors, tethering factors, kinases, phosphatases and motor proteins in vesicle transport process [18]. Our previous studies found that several Rab proteins are hijacked by YHV [11], [12]. Specifically, the transportation of YHV particles required PmRab5 which is a key protein in vesicles transport to early endosome; whereas, PmRab7 is involved in YHV transportation from early endosome to late endosome and lysosome. The silencing effects of PmRab5 or PmRab7 in YHV-infected P. monodon inhibited YHV expression, suggesting that PmRab5 and PmRab7 are involved in intracellular trafficking of YHV [11], [12].",

Then, 5Rab11_R1 and PRT primers (Table 1) were used to synthesize the first PCR product which was diluted to 1:100 for used as template in the nested PCR with 5Rab11_R2 and PM1 primers (Table 1). To obtain the 3\u02b9 end of PmRab11 cDNA, 3\u02b9 RACE PCR was performed by PRT primer to generate the first-strand cDNAs. Then, the PCR reaction containing 3Rab11_F1 and PM-1 primers was performed. Next, two nested PCRs were performed using 3Rab11_F2 and PM-1 primers and 3Rab11_F3 and PM-1 primers (Table 1). Then, all expected bands of the 5\u02b9 and 3\u02b9 RACE PCR products were purified by Gel/PCR fragments extraction kit (Geneaid), cloned into pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) and sequenced (First Base Co.

The theoretical pI and molecular weight are 5.22 and 23.85 kDa, respectively. In addition, this protein shared the characteristics of Rab11 protein family when compared to others species such as five GTP biding domains (G1-G5), five Rab family domains (RabF1-5), four Rab subfamily domains (RabSF1-4) and a prenylation site that usually terminated in CC or CXC motif at the C-terminus (Fig. 2\n). The amino acid sequence identity showed that PmRab11 protein shared 100% amino sequence identity with Rab11 of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and shared approximately 80% with Rab11 of vertebrates such as zebrafish (Danio rerio). In addition, the phylogenetic tree revealed that PmRab11 protein was closely related to Rab11 of vertebrate and arthropods (Fig. 3\n). It was not clustered with other Rab proteins including Rab5, Rab6 and Rab7. These results indicate that PmRab11 is a highly conserved protein.",

As the nucleotide sequences of dsRNA-PmRab11 contained many conserved domains such as Rab family domains, Rab subfamily domains and GTP binding domains, it is possible that some of the regions of dsRNA-PmRab11 are similar to other Rab genes. Therefore, a specific inhibition to PmRab11 expression was investigated. The results showed that suppression of PmRab11 by injection of dsRNA-PmRab11 has no effect on the levels of PmRab5 and PmRab7 expression from 24 to 72 h post-dsRNA injection (Fig. 4B). Large standard deviation of PmRab7 after 24 h dsRNA injection may be due to varying expression of PmRab7 among shrimp samples.",

            "text": "At present, the mechanisms of YHV internalization and transportation inside the cell have been proposed. The viral glycoprotein gp116 on YHV envelope binds to the YHV binding protein, PmYRP65 on the cell membrane [30], [31] then internalizes into the cell via clathrin-dependent endocytosis [32], [33]. After that, the vesicle containing YHV particle is transported to the early and late endosome by Rab5 and Rab7, respectively [11], [12] before the viral genome is released to the cytoplasm for replication and translation. Electron microscopy revealed that enveloped YHV virion is formed at TGN [2], [13]. However, the mechanism of the transport of YHV from TGN to PM is not well understood. The earlier studies of other (+) ssRNA viruses such as flaviviruses and coronaviruses found that viral budding from TGN to PM is dependent on Rab11-mediated pathway through cytoskeleton network [34], [35]. Interestingly, Rab11 of YHV-infected shrimp was shown to be upregulated after 24 h of infection [26]. A comparative proteomic analysis showed that the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was increased during YHV infection [36]. PDI is normally localized in the lumen of ER catalyzing the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds [37]. It has also been reported to be involved in the folding and assembly of viral proteins in the ER [38]. The YHV structural proteins, gp116 and gp64, contain 26 and 24 cysteine residues, respectively, suggesting a possible role for PDI to form inter- and intra-molecular disulfide bonds during the folding of these viral proteins [13]. Therefore, it is possible that PmRab11 also play a role in the transport of YHV out of the cell.",

The existence of the two variants of PmRab11 was confirmed by amplification of the full-length cDNA and by 5\u02b9 RACE (Supplementary Fig. 2). The nucleotide deletion at the 5\u02b9 end of the two forms has not been observed for other Rab11. However, at least three isoforms of Rab11 proteins such as Rab11A, Rab11B and Rab11C (occasionally called Rab25) have been reported and shown to localize differently at specific organelles. Rab11A and B localize at the Golgi, RE and early endosomes and may be involved in membrane trafficking pathway by transportation of the target protein from TGN/RE to plasma membrane [39]. While Rab11C is expressed only in certain epithelial cells and may be involved in vesicular trafficking from recycling endosome to plasma membrane [39], [40]. The deduced PmRab11 protein shared a characteristic signature of Rab11 with other species and closely related to Rab11 in invertebrate, especially in shrimp species (100% amino acid sequence identity with Rab11 of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei). The PmRab11 function was characterized by using RNAi approach. Knockdown of PmRab11 by dsRNA-PmRab11 specifically inhibited PmRab11 expression within 24 h but not PmRab5 and PmRab7 expression. Suppression of PmRab11 led to 100% shrimp death at day 7. Similar results were demonstrated in the knockdown effect of endogenous genes that are involved in the trafficking process in shrimp including PmRab5, PmRab7 and clathrin heavy chain [11], [12], [33]. In addition, Rab11 is an essential gene in the regulation of transportation of the endocytosed proteins [18], [41], [42].",

The PmRab11 expression was suppressed approximately 50% at 48 h post-dsRNA injection (or 24 h post-YHV infection) (Fig. 5A). This is in contrast to the result of PmRab11 knockdown alone (without YHV infection) that PmRab11 expression was inhibited more than 90% at this time point (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, subtractive hybridization found that Rab11 was upregulated at 24 h post-YHV infection [26]. Therefore, it is possible that an incomplete PmRab11 knockdown is caused by upregulation of PmRab11 expression in response to YHV infection. In addition, viral titre inside and outside the cell was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that YHV levels in hemocytes and supernatant of PmRab11 knockdown group were significantly decreased from 48 to 72 h post-YHV infection when compared to the NaCl-injected group. Notably, not only PmRab11 expression was recovered at 120 h post-dsRNA injection, but also the YHV released was increase at this time point. This relationship demonstrated that PmRab11 is required for YHV infection. Similar results were observed in the plaque assay of virus infected cells that were treated with siRNA targeting Rab11 such as hantavirus [25], Influenza A [43], and hepatitis C virus [44].",

            "text": "To estimate the YHV's protein level in hemocytes and supernatant, Western blot was performed using antibody against YHV-gp64 which is one of the viral glycoproteins on YHV envelope. Unfortunately, our Rab11 antibody cannot be used to detect Rab11 protein by Western blot under the denaturing condition, suggesting that it required the native structure of epitopes. The results revealed that YHV protein level cannot be observed in both fractions of all experimental groups at 24 h post-dsRNA injection (Fig. 6). Previous study in PmRab5 knockdown during YHV infection found that YHV is internalized and transported via PmRab5 from PM to early endosome around 10 min\u20136 h post-infection [10]. After that, viral replication occurred and nucleocapsid was found in cytoplasm at 24 h post-YHV infection [13]. Thus, the, low level of YHV-gp64 protein at the early phase of infection and the failure to detect the protein in Western blot at this time point. At 48 h post-dsRNA injection, high YHV protein level in the NaCl-injected group can be observed. Whereas, the dsRNA-GFP injected group showed low YHV protein level at this time point. Many studies found that the innate antiviral immunity in invertebrates including shrimp was induced by any dsRNA in a sequence-independent manner [45], [46]. High levels YHV protein in hemocytes and supernatant of the NaCl injected group and dsRNA-GFP injected group could be observed at 72 h. In contrast, YHV levels could not be detected in both fractions of PmRab11 knockdown group at 24\u201372 h post-dsRNA injection. For the (+) ssRNA virus including YHV, the replication process occurs in the cytoplasm [47] and the viral envelop glycoproteins are co-translationally inserted into ER membranes. Then, modification of the glycoproteins occurs during their passage through the secretory pathway. For example, all structural proteins of members of the Flaviviridae family such as hepatitis C and dengue virus are co-translated as a single polyprotein and are inserted into the ER membrane [48]. An individual glycoprotein is generated by proteolytic cleavage and the RNA-binding core protein that is known as the nucleocapsid is assembled within the ER, and transported to Golgi apparatus. It is possible that these events may also occur for YHV which is one of the (+) ssRNA. The single polyprotein containing gp116 and gp64 is co-translated and inserted into the ER membrane. The proteolytic cleavage resulted in individual gp116 and gp 64 that exposed the N-terminal domain to the cytosolic side [7]. Then, the viral nucleocapsid and glycoproteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus for maturation. At TGN, the budding of YHV envelope virion can be observed under electron microscope [2], [13]. Normally, Rab11 is involved in the vesicle transport from TGN to the PM [49]. After PmRab11 knockdown, YHV cannot bud and has no target organelle to transport to. Therefore, the YHV protein in Golgi network might be transported to lysosome for degradation. However, the mechanism in this process remains to be elucidated. Similar results can be observed in the dengue virus [50]. In addition, the mortality assay revealed that injection of dsRNA-PmRab11 can delay shrimp mortality when compared to both control groups. Similar results of the delay in shrimp mortalities can be demonstrated for the knockdown effects of other Rab proteins including PmRab7 and PmRab5 during YHV infection [11], [12].",

The virus was accumulated at the perinuclear region that was identified as TGN [25], [44], [50].

Rab6 is involved in the regulation of phagocytosis against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection through the interaction with the WSSV envelope protein VP466, \u03b2-actin, and tropomyosin which could activate the GTPase activity of Rab6 and subsequently induce the rearrangement of actin fibers in invertebrates [51], [52]. An increase in Rab6 activity was demonstrated in WSSV resistant shrimp. Silencing of Rab6 by a specific siRNA significantly increased WSSV replication in shrimp [53], [54]. In addition, Rab6 plays an important role in the regulation of phagocytosis against bacterial infection in Marsupenaeus japonicus\n[55].",
