Although microbial culture is regarded as the gold standard, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Specially, some fastidious pathogens are difficult to cultivate. Antigen/antibody detection is fast and simple, however, insufficient sensitivity limits its usage in clinical settings. Nowadays, molecular techniques are becoming widely used for identification of respiratory etiologies in clinical practice. Multiplex PCR can detect several targets at one time, however, design and optimization of dozens of primers and probes remain challenging. Microarray has the benefits of high-throughput, speed and low-cost. Suspension microarray enables simultaneously detect a number of pathogens in a single assay, it has faster hybridization kinetics and more flexibility in array construction compared to traditional solid-phase array.",

Recently, several studies have described the performance of nasal swab, nasal wash, nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples in microbiological findings using qRT-PCR or multipathogen detection platforms [5\u20139]. When testing for respiratory agents, the recommended and commonly collected sample is an upper respiratory swab because nasopharynx and oropharynx are two of the most common portals for the introduction of microbes into the respiratory tract. However, collection of NPS is an uncomfortable sampling method for young children, particularly pediatric patients with nasal congestion. Compared to NPS, OPS is less technically challenging and more acceptable to children because it is quick and simple [10]. In addition, some reports have showed that OPS can increase the number of viral infections identified by 15%, compared to the NPS alone [11]. Specifically, it has been found to be significantly more sensitive than NPS for the detection of certain viruses, such as adenovirus and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus [12]. So far, few studies have compared BALF and paired OPS samples from young children hospitalized with RTI.",

For the 14 cases, they might be infected by some rare pathogens that are not covered by our suspension array. The top 5 pathogens were RSV, SP, Hi, MP and Adv, accounting for 74.2% of etiological fraction. Our data are in agreement with other recent findings in multi-country case-control studies that found RSV was the most common cause of severe childhood pneumonia [20, 21]. Thus, RSV could be a primary target for children hospitalized with respiratory illness. In general, RSV is most commonly found in lower respiratory tract infections particularly in infants [22]. However, the sensitivities of RSV between OPS and BALF was not significantly different in our testing. RSV infection and replication initiates in the nasopharynx. The virus could be found in both upper and lower airway via high-sensitivity molecular techniques when it spreads from the upper respiratory tract to the lower in individuals with compromised immunity.",

Identification of Bordetella pertussis in BALF or OPS specimens may provide predictive value for the outcome of respiratory illness at the individual case level [23]. In terms of some pathogens such as influenza A, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, relatively low concordance between BALF and OPS specimens for them may reflect different cell tropisms for different parts of the respiratory tract. Notably, none of the 76 cases was tested positive for HRV in this work, which is somewhat surprising given that this virus is often associated with upper respiratory infection. However, another project in our group showed that the detection rate of HRV was ~ 2% in OPS among 2895 pediatric outpatients with respiratory illness. Here, the included children were inpatients. Although HRV infections are frequent, they are mostly limited to the upper respiratory tract and generally cause relatively mild symptoms [24, 25]. The contribution of HRV may vary by disease severity of included patients and other factors.",

Compared with PCR-based methods, the detection rate of it was significantly lower. One of possible explanations is the empirical antibiotic therapy in patients before sampling. Here, we focused on comparison of OPS and paired BALF in detecting respiratory pathogens, rather than the sensitivity of nucleic acid-based array compared to the gold standard, i.e. cultivation. Based on the same consideration, a healthy control group was not tested for ruling out false positives in this work because of our specific interest and aim. Similarly, a prior study, 86 patients enrolled and no healthy controls included, has also applied this strategy to compare the yields of bronchoalveolar lavage samples with that of nasopharyngeal swabs by using FilmArray respiratory panel [8].",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, our sample size was relatively small (n = 76) because we focused on paired BALF and OPS specimens collected from hospitalized children. As a result, there was limited power to compare the sensitivities of BALF and OPS for specific respiratory pathogens in patients. Further studies in a larger cohort may generate a relatively high degree of precision when performing comparative statistical analysis. Second, although BALF are regarded lower respiratory tract samples, oropharyngeal intubation for BALF might result in potential contamination by upper respiratory tract \u201ccontaminants\u201d, particularly for bacteria/viruses known to colonize the oropharynx. Thus, the BALF specimen might be actually both an upper and a lower airway combined sample. However, it does not affect our primary purpose that focuses on the microbiological findings of OPS sampling. Third, empirical antibiotic use in clinical practice may reduce the sensitivity of assays, particularly for bacteria. Collectively, identification of a pathogen does not necessarily equate to the etiological agent, particularly in a multipathogen testing and laboratory results require further interpretation by experienced clinicians. In addition, we here focused on a subset of potential pathogens because the 13 agents (8 viruses and 5 bacteria) are key respiratory pathogens in children based on previous epidemiological investigations in China. In fact, fungi are also important pathogens causing severe infections of the respiratory system. Another project in our group by using metagenomic next-generation sequencing found that the infection rates of Candida albicans, Pneumocystis jiroveci and Aspergillus fumigatus in young children admitted to PICU with respiratory illness were 3.52, 1.68 and 1.23%, respectively. Given the high prevalence and importance of the airborne fungal pathogens in respiratory infections, we plan to add fungal species to our upgraded in-house array, which would be a separate study due to many experiments and large undertakings.",
