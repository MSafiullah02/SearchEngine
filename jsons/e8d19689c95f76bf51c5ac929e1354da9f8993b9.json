Considering the data of the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, where there is a significant stake of the population making their living in the informal economy and thus prone to not follow self-isolation, we assert that if the confinement measures are lifted too soon, namely as much as one week of consecutive declining numbers of new cases, it is very likely the appearance of a second peak .",

Although there are some differences among the countries public health policies, the vast majority of them has tried to reduce the growth rate of the pandemic by implementing policies of social distancing [1] aiming at preventing mayhem of the health-care systems, the so-called \"flattening of the curve\". A series of models have been brought forth to the specific study of the evolution of COVID-19 through the world [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, Email address: nuno@mail.if.uff.br (Corresponding author) (N. Crokidakis) arXiv:2005.09019v1 [q-bio.PE] 18 May 2020 29, 30, 31] . Initially, some of those works focused on its calibration in order to estimate typical parameters of the disease, like infection rates, epidemic doubling times among others [3, 5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28] . After these preliminary studies, many authors considered the effect of several types of non-pharmaceutical interventions [2, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24, 25, 31] .",

They verified that the impact of lockdown is stronger in municipalities with higher fiscal capacity, and also that mobility restrictions are stronger in municipalities for which inequality is higher and where individuals have lower income per capita, causing a segregation effect. In Ref. [33] the authors also discussed about the income distribution, that play an important role: municipalities where inequality is greater have experienced stronger increase in mobility and their citizens are more at risk. Finally, they concluded that the results suggest the necessity of asymmetric fiscal measures. In other words, according to that work, central governments should implement financial transfer mechanisms to people, companies and local local government in the form of living allowances, no-interest loans and treasury transfers to compensate the loss of tax income to allow each case to cope with the current scenario. As also stated in Ref. [33] , the absence of targeted lines of intervention during the lockdown would induce a further increase in poverty and inequality.",

Such figures show that for epidemiological parameters estimated from data of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil it is very likely the emergence of a second peak (regimes I+II) if the preventive measures are lifted too soon. Even more alarming, there is a non-negligible risk for the magnitude of such second peak be higher than the first one (regime I). Apart from this, we note that for a given t OFF there is the possibility for a twofold effect in which an intervention designed to hamper the epidemic spreading can backfire. However, in such a situation the establishment of positive or negative outcomes depends on the combinations of \u03c6 Fig.5 . Such findings highlight that it is significant to have a substantial alignment between different interventions designed to decrease the degree of noncompliance as well as to support the fraction of the population that cannot afford for the self-isolation even after the first peak of spreading. Moreover, complementary studies using different parameters to the Brazilian case we could verify that the present model is also capable of reproducing different situations of separated peaks as found in several U.S.A. cities during the spanish flu pandemics [41, 42] . Therein, it is possible to assess the impact of different public health measures in the number and evolution of fatalities, with some cities basically exhibiting a single peak (an indicator of proper policies) and other cities with significant second peaks. Importantly, some of the cities showing two peaks were cities that had social-economical problems reminiscent of those one can find in Brazil. In other words, although we have adjusted our model to the present COVID-19 case, our model is likely to be relevant in the analysis of other situations, namely the computational forward testing of public health policies.",

In [44] they calibrated a stochastic agent-based model from data in France and they projected that it would be unlikely to prevent the second chain of contagions once quarantine is lifted. A second chain of spreading was also predicted -using a generalization of the SIR model -as a potential outcome for Italy after the relaxation of the mobility restrictions [45] . A recent work considering the case of Brazil in a group-free Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead model presented some time series suggesting that the social isolation must hold until the end of 2020 in order to diminish the second peak [29] . Effectively, the conclusion of all those works is that the safer situation is to hold the isolation for as long as possible in order to decrease the second peak height.",

While the first group usually belongs to the higher income class or is able to work at home, the second group is usually in a low income class and supplies services to consumers and businesses, and is not able to provide their services in home office. In this context, the results show that the existence of these two types of social behaviours strongly affects the dynamics and possibility of a second peak in the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil.",

In the setting with t OFF = 7 and f 1 = 0.6, the overwhelming majority of configurations lead to the establishment of the regime I, as previously observed. But, this advantage of the regime I decrease as f 2 decreases (by increasing f 1 ). In the setting with t OFF = 15 all the scenarios exhibit a smaller proportion for the regime I in comparison with corresponding scenarios for t OFF = 7. However, there is a dual effect of rising f 1 . On the one hand, it increases the proportion of configurations associated with the regime III. On the other hand, it also increases the possibilities for the emergence of regime I. In the setting with t OFF = 30 we also see a double-edged sword: (a) the percentage of regime I is null and all the percentage of the regime III are higher than the corresponding to the cases t OFF = {7, 15}; (b) an increase of f 1 increases the relative advantage of regime II. These nonmonotonic effects arises because some combinations the regime I and other combinations favor the regime III as depicted inFigure 5. Such mechanism is corroborated with the panels (d-f) where we see that the combinations satisfying \u03c6 to a monotonic behavior of p regime vs f 1 for all t OFF = {7, 15, 30}.",

Such results show that an increment in t OFF leads to an overall decrease in the relative epidemic size (RES). But a detailed analysis in each panel shows that an increase in f 1 produces an increase in the interquartile range of values for RES (gray area). This indicates the presence of a twofold effect since RES can achieve smaller values as f 1 increases, but it also leads to the possibility for RES reaching higher values. Again such twofold effect arises because some combinations \u03c6 for an increase in RES and other combinations promote a decrease in RES as unveiled in Figure 5. This is confirmed with the panels (d-f) where the combinations satisfying to an increase in RES as f 1 where increase for all t OFF = {7, 15, 30}.",
