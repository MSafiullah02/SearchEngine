The stage of lung growth and development affects disease manifestations, and the injury and repair processes in immature lung differ from those in the mature adult lung (Clement and Eber 2008) . In recognition of these differences with adult DLD, standardized approaches to the diagnosis and classification of pediatric DLD have been advocated, incorporating insights from diagnostic imaging, infant pulmonary function testing, molecular genetics, immunopathology, and electron microscopy (Deutsch et al. 2007) . This chapter will review the classification, clinical features, and imaging findings of pediatric DLD.",

While rare, the true prevalence of pediatric DLD is likely understated in the medical literature as a consequence of more hesitant use of diagnostic lung biopsy in children compared to adults and the lack of familiarity with recently described disorders and appropriate classification. Pediatric DLD usually presents either with rapid respiratory failure in the neonatal period or with an insidious course of respiratory signs and symptoms, failure to thrive, or exercise intolerance later in infancy, childhood, or adolescence. The signs and symptoms may be misattributed for many months or even years to common disorders, such as pulmonary infection, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), asthma, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, or immunodeficiency. Once these common disorders have been eliminated as causal, criteria have been devised to assist clinicians in identifying children that warrant further investigation for possible DLD. A neonate or infant is proposed as having ''childhood ILD syndrome'' or ''chILD syndrome'' if at least three of the following criteria are present: (1) respiratory symptoms (cough, rapid, and/or difficult breathing, or exercise intolerance), (2) signs (tachypnea, adventitious sounds, retractions, digital clubbing, failure to thrive, or respiratory failure), (3) hypoxemia; and (4) diffuse pulmonary parenchymal abnormality on chest radiograph (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) (Kurland et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "Correct diagnosis of a DLD is important due to widely differing prognoses among the disorders and the need for genetic evaluation and counseling for some families. To promote effective communication for clinical care and research, the disorders affecting infants and young children with ''chILD syndrome'' have been organized by the chILD Research Cooperative into a novel classification scheme (Deutsch et al. 2007 ) categorized on the basis of the presumed etiology, with overlap of distinct clinical disorders and pathologies among different etiologic categories. For example, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), DIP, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI) are distinct pathologies that can be associated with genetic surfactant disorders, and NSIP pathology can be observed in genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism, disorders related to systemic disease processes (such as immune-mediated connective tissue disease) or disorders of the normal immunocompetent host (such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis). In such a classification based on etiology, disorders that can be idiopathic or secondary to other conditions are difficult to categorize. Despite its limitations, the chILD classification scheme has been found applicable to over 90 % of cases of DLD encountered in the setting of a children's hospital, including previously unclassified cases , and several of the disorders are recognized by diagnosis codes in the latest versions of the International Classification of Diseases by the World Health Organization (Popler et al. 2012) . While the chILD classification generally works well for infants and young children (Langston and Dishop 2009 ), expansion and modification of the classification is necessary for older children and adolescents who may manifest with forms of DLD more prevalent in adults (Rice et al. 2013) (Table 1) . Infants are more likely to have developmental, growth, or genetic disorders, while older children and adolescents are more likely to have disorders related to systemic diseases, infections, or environmental exposures.",

For some types of pediatric DLD, the imaging findings are highly specific, while for others the imaging findings are nonspecific and laboratory tests or lung biopsy are needed for definitive diagnosis (Kurland et al. 2013 ). In addition to suggesting or corroborating a specific diagnosis in some cases, imaging can be useful for refining the differential diagnosis, identifying biopsy sites, monitoring disease activity, and assessing response to therapy. The remainder of this chapter will provide an updated summary of the characteristic clinical and imaging features of the disorders categorized under a modified chILD classification scheme of pediatric DLD.",

Congenital alveolar dysplasia is characterized by arrest in the late canalicular/early saccular phase, resulting in incomplete alveolarization. Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) is characterized by malpositioning of the pulmonary vein branches adjacent to the pulmonary artery branches rather than within the interlobular septa, medial hypertrophy of the pulmonary arterioles, reduced alveolar capillary density, and pulmonary lobular maldevelopment. Pulmonary lymphangiectasia is also present in about one-third of cases (Dishop 2011) . The misaligned pulmonary veins in ACD/MPV may actually represent anastomotic bronchial veins associated with intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting. This shunting bypasses the alveolar capillary bed and exacerbates the hypoxemia from right-to-left extrapulmonary shunting associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (Galambos et al. 2014 ).",

Lung growth abnormalities are characterized histologically by impaired alveolarization manifesting as lobular simplification with deficient alveolar vascularization and septation, reduced alveolar number, and increased alveolar size resembling emphysema (Dishop 2010) . As a consequence, there is diminished total alveolar surface area and reduced pulmonary diffusing capacity relative to alveolar volume (Balinotti et al. 2010) . Lung growth abnormalities are often accompanied by patchy PIG or by pulmonary arterial hypertensive changes related to increased vascular resistance from a deficient capillary bed (Dishop 2011) .",

The most common prenatal form is pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to limited intrathoracic space in utero, such as from a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, oligohydramnios, thoracic mass lesion, or skeletal dysplasia. The most frequently encountered postnatal form is chronic lung disease of infancy (CLDI) related to prematurity. This includes ''new'' BPD, which is characterized by impaired alveolarization, but less fibrosis and airway obstruction compared to classic BPD (Bhandari and Bhandari 2009) , and Wilson-Mikity syndrome, which is characterized by slowly progressive respiratory distress and cyst-like changes of the lungs developing within the first few weeks of life despite minimal respiratory support at birth (Hoepker et al. 2008; Philip 2009 ).

The decreased lung attenuation is likely attributable to enlarged alveoli with reduced alveolar septation and vascularization (Mahut et al. 2007 ). Decreased lung attenuation on CT correlates with the clinical severity of BPD (la Tour et al. 2013) . Reproducible quantitative CT scoring systems based on the extent of findings, such as decreased lung attenuation, linear opacities, and architectural distortion at a mean postmenstrual age of 39 weeks show better correlation than do CXR scores with the clinical severity of BPD, and higher CT scores predict a higher risk of rehospitalization for pneumonia (Shin et al. 2013) . CT scoring systems are superior to pulmonary function testing for differentiating infants with and without a history of BPD and higher CT scores are associated with a greater number of days on supplemental oxygen (Sarria et al. 2011 ). Ventilationperfusion (V/Q) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed at a mean postmenstrual age of 37 weeks commonly reveals V/Q mismatching, even in clinically mild BPD, and the degree of V/Q mismatching correlates with the duration of mechanical ventilation (Kjellberg et al. 2013) . Residual pulmonary abnormalities on CT are very common in adolescent and young adult survivors of classic BPD born in the pre-surfactant era, with the most frequent findings being subpleural, triangular, and linear opacities, air trapping, and emphysema (Aukland et al. 2006; Wong et al. 2008 Wong et al. , 2011 (Fig. 3) . The imaging findings in adolescent and adult survivors of ''new'' BPD are not yet well described. The imaging findings of BPD are further discussed in the chapter entitled Neonatal Chest Imaging by Crotty in this book.",

Corticosteroid therapy may hasten the resolution of PIG, possibly due to acceleration of lung maturation rather than to suppression of inflammation (Deterding 2010; Deutsch and Young 2010; Canakis et al. 2002; Onland et al. 2005 ), but should be used judiciously in this self-limited disorder due to the risks of neuro-developmental impairment, immunosuppression, and poor wound healing associated with corticosteroids (Radman et al. 2013 ).",

Detection of PNECs on histology is facilitated by special staining for bombesin. PNECs are involved in oxygen sensing and fetal lung development, and rapidly decline in number in normal individuals after the neonatal period. The absence of other significant airway or interstitial disease is an important criterion for the diagnosis of NEHI, since increased numbers of PNECs can also be observed in dissimilar conditions, such as sudden infant death syndrome, BPD, pulmonary hypertension, cystic fibrosis, mechanical ventilation, and smoke exposure (Dishop 2011) . NEHI may be associated with minor patchy inflammation or fibrosis in a small proportion of airways . The existence of familial cases of NEHI suggests a genetic etiology for some cases (Popler et al. 2010) . Heterozygous mutations in the NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1) gene have been reported in a NEHI case, but are not suspected as the predominant cause of NEHI .",

Auscultation may reveal crackles, but wheezing is unusual. The anteroposterior diameter of the chest is often increased. Symptoms can be precipitated or exacerbated by viral respiratory infections or residence at high altitude ). Lung function tests show peripheral airway obstruction and profound air trapping with reduced forced expiratory flow (FEV) and markedly elevated functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV) (Kerby et al. 2013; Lukkarinen et al. 2013) . The severity of air trapping as measured by FRC and RV inversely correlates with room air oxygen saturation at short-term (6-12 months) followup, providing a possible prognostic marker. Compared to BPD patients, NEHI patients have similar degrees of airway obstruction, but greater air trapping (Kerby et al. 2013 ). Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis. Axial chest CT image from a 7-week-old, former 29-week preemie with hypoxemia shows both ground-glass opacities and hyperlucent pulmonary lobules. Lung biopsy revealed a growth abnormality with superimposed alveolar wall thickening related to pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis Fig. 5 Growth abnormality. An axial chest CT inspiratory image (a) from a six-month-old girl with an X-linked filamin A gene mutation demonstrates severe bilateral pulmonary hyperinflation and scattered atelectasis. The corresponding axial chest CT expiratory image (b) reveals narrowing of the trachea related to tracheomalacia. A coronal chest MR angiography image (c) obtained at 2 years of age shows dilation of the ascending aorta and innominate artery The severity of airway obstruction correlates with the prominence of PNECs . Treatment is largely supportive and focused on oxygen supplementation and nutritional support. Bronchodilators and corticosteroids have not been shown to be beneficial except for treatment of superimposed viral infections (Kerby et al. 2013; Lukkarinen et al. 2013) . NEHI is not a life-threatening condition and most patients show clinical and radiographic improvement, especially after two years of age. However, some patients require supplemental oxygen for months to years, and air trapping and exercise intolerance may persist into adolescence (Deterding 2010; Gomes et al. 2013) . The development of nonatopic asthma has also been reported in follow-up (Lukkarinen et al. 2013 ).",

Ground-glass opacities may also be present at the peripheral posterior aspects of the lungs. Consolidation, nodules, septal thickening, cysts, and bronchiectasis are usually absent, and the presence of these findings suggests a superimposed or alternative disorder. NEHI is unable to be excluded by CT, since the sensitivity of CT for NEHI is approximately 80 %, and missed diagnosis may occur when the ground-glass opacities are faint or distributed in an atypical pattern ).

The lowering of intra-alveolar surface tension by surfactant is required for normal respiratory function. Surfactant also plays a role in innate host defense. Surfactant is cleared by uptake into alveolar epithelial cells or alveolar macrophages under stimulation by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Suzuki et al. 2010) . Genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism are a primary cause of unexplained fatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in term neonates, and are increasingly identified as a cause of chronic DLD in older infants, children, and adolescents. The most frequently identified disease-causing mutations involve the genes encoding ATP binding cassette A3 (ABCA3) (Hamvas 2010) and surfactant protein C (SP-C) (Nathan et al. 2012) . Other disease-causing mutations may involve the genes encoding surfactant protein B (SP-B), colony-stimulating factor 2 receptor alpha (CSFRA), NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1), and solute carrier family 7 amino acid transporter member 7 (SLC7A7) (Nogee 2010) .",

A common clinical presentation of DLD related to SP-C or ABCA3 gene mutations is cough, tachypnea, and hypoxemia beginning in infancy. Alternatively, affected individuals can remain asymptomatic for years despite progressive fibrosis before sudden life-threatening deterioration occurs. Heterozygosity for an ABCA3 mutation can modify the severity of DLD associated with an SP-C mutation (Bullard and Nogee 2007) .

An axial chest CT image (a) from a 5-week-old shows diffuse ground-glass opacities and right parahilar consolidation. An axial chest CT image (b) from a five-month-old depicts diffuse ground-glass opacities and septal thickening. An axial chest CT image (c) from a 9-year-old reveals patchy ground-glass opacities and scattered small parenchymal cysts can lead to maldevelopment of the basal ganglia and thyroid and decreased production of surfactant proteins, resulting in ''brain-lung-thyroid syndrome'' characterized by congenital hypothyroidism, hypotonia, chorea, and lung disease. Only a slight majority of cases manifest with the full syndrome, and there is isolated lung disease in one-fifth of cases at presentation. Mortality related to the lung disease is around 20 % (Carre et al. 2009; Hamvas et al. 2013) . Clinical manifestations of the lung disease are varied and illustrate the diverse role NKX2-1 plays in surfactant function, alveolarization, and innate immunity. The presenting pulmonary phenotype is severe neonatal RDS in about three-fourths of cases and chronic childhood DLD in about one-fifth of cases. Recurrent respiratory infections are also common Hamvas et al. 2013 ). The histology is heterogeneous, and may include changes of PAP, CPI, DIP, NSIP, or growth abnormality with alveolar simplification. CT findings include diffuse or patchy ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and cysts (Galambos et al. 2010; Hamvas et al. 2013) (Fig. 10) . Thyroid ultrasonography or scintigraphy reveals thyroid hypoplasia, hemiagenesis or athyreosis in 45 % of cases (Carre et al. 2009 ). Intriguingly, a case of NEHI associated with NKX2-1 mutations has been reported, suggesting that NEHI may result from altered expression of genes regulated by NKX2-1 other than those in the surfactant system .",

The lung involvement can occur at any age, including childhood, and is characterized by endogenous lipoid pneumonia, PAP, or pulmonary hemorrhage. CT is a sensitive test for diagnosing early lung involvement that manifests as septal thickening, nodules, and subpleural cysts prior to the onset of respiratory symptoms or pulmonary function test abnormalities (Santamaria et al. 1996) . Some patients rapidly progress to respiratory failure with widespread pulmonary airspace opacities on CXR and CT related to PAP from alveolar macrophage dysfunction (Parto et al. 1993; Ogier de Baulny et al. 2012) . LPI is generally treated with dietary protein restriction and L-citrulline supplementation.

            "text": "The clinical syndrome of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is characterized histologically by constriction or obliteration of the lumens of small airways by a fibroblastic reparative response to injury. The inciting event is typically a respiratory infection (especially adenovirus, influenza virus, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae) with extensive airway mucosal necrosis. Other preceding conditions include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic inhalational injury, graft-versus-host disease, and chronic airway rejection in the setting of lung transplantation (Dishop 2010) . There is a predominance of male patients. The time interval between infection and symptoms and signs of obstructive lung disease, such as wheezing, tachypnea, and dyspnea is variable and can be as short as a few months, although the diagnosis after onset of symptoms is often delayed for many months (Lino et al. 2013) . CXRs in patients with BO often show hyperinflation, but CXRs are generally nonspecific and insensitive. Characteristic findings of post-infectious pediatric BO on CT include increased lung volume, bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, mosaic attenuation, parenchymal hyperlucency, pulmonary vascular attenuation, and expiratory air trapping (Yalcin et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 1999; Bandeira et al. 2011; Lino et al. 2013) (Fig. 13) . Hyperlucency, mosaic attenuation, air trapping, and bronchiectasis tend to be more marked in BO than in problematic severe asthma (Bandeira et al. 2011) . The combination of a typical clinical history, adenovirus infection, and mosaic attenuation on CT is highly specific for post-infectious BO in young children (Colom and Teper 2009) . CT offers the ability to survey the entire lungs, while the heterogeneous distribution of airway involvement in BO poses the risk of a false-negative biopsy from inadequate tissue sampling (Moonnumakal and Fan 2008) . A confident diagnosis of BO can be made without the need for lung biopsy in the setting of a child with a suggestive clinical presentation, a fixed obstructive pattern on pulmonary function testing, and characteristic CT findings. The combination of pulmonary vascular attenuation and hyperlucency on CT is highly specific for moderate or severe nontransplant BO in children (Smith et al. 2011 ). However, the sensitivity of CT for moderate or severe nontransplant BO in children is only modest, so that CT cannot exclude BO (Smith et al. 2011) . CT is valuable as a prognostic tool since severe abnormalities on CT in children under three years of age with post-infectious BO predict poor lung function several years later (Mattiello et al. 2010) .",

There may also be patchy peribronchial eosinophilic pneumonia. Imaging shows central bronchiectasis with or without mucoid impaction. Bronchocentric granulomatosis (BCG) develops as an abnormal cell-mediated response to Aspergillus and may be part of the spectrum of ABPA or occur as an isolated disorder. BCG is characterized by destructive granulomatous lesions along the bronchi and bronchioles with intraluminal inspissations and surrounding eosinophilic pneumonia, resulting in airway-centric nodular, ''sausage-like,'' or consolidative opacities on imaging (Jeong et al. 2007; Kradin and Mark 2008) (Fig. 15 ). Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a life-threatening systemic necrotizing vasculitis that commonly involves the lungs, upper airway, musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal system, nervous system, skin, and heart. Subpleural consolidation, centrilobular nodules, bronchial wall thickening, and septal thickening are typical pulmonary imaging manifestations of EGPA (Gendelman et al. 2013 ).",

An axial chest CT image from a 2-year-old depicts multiple, airway-centric, nodular, and short tubular opacities in the right lung related to granulomatous lesions along the airways with endoluminal plugging A NSIP pattern with interstitial fibrosis and cystic remodeling may be observed in the chronic setting (Dishop 2010) . Birds, pets, and molds are the most common precipitating agents in children. Other causes include highly reactive lowmolecular-weight compounds in spray paints, epoxy resins, glues, and insecticides, as well as drugs such as methotrexate (Vece and Fan 2010) . There is a mean lag time of 11 months from symptom onset to diagnosis, and a meticulous environmental exposure history is a crucial step in the clinical evaluation. The most common symptom is dyspnea with exercise, followed by dyspnea at rest, dry cough, and weight loss. CXRs are limited in sensitivity, being normal in over one-third of cases at initial presentation (Buchvald et al. 2011) . The absence of serum-precipitating antibodies does not exclude the diagnosis (Clement et al. 2010; Vece and Fan 2010) . A presumptive diagnosis without biopsy can be made in children with an exposure history and positive precipitins, lymphocytosis on BAL, and typical findings on CT (Vece and Fan 2011) . Consolidation and ground-glass opacities that can mimic infection or edema are typical on CT in the acute phase. Ill-defined centrilobular nodules, ground-glass opacities, and low attenuation foci of air trapping are characteristic of the subacute phase. Irregular linear or reticular opacities, architectural distortion, and honeycombing indicative of fibrosis can be observed in the chronic phase (Fig. 16) . If there is ongoing exposure to the inciting antigen, there can be findings of multiple phases superimposed. The imaging findings associated with the acute and subacute phases usually regress after treatment with corticosteroids and elimination of exposure to the offending antigen, but fibrosis from the chronic phase may persist (Hartman 2003; MacDonald and M\u00fcller 2003; Buchvald et al. 2011 ).",

The presence of increased lipid-laden macrophages on BAL or lung biopsy is also not specific for aspiration, as this can be observed with other conditions, such as resolving hemorrhage, pneumonia, and surfactant disorders. CT can play an important role in suggesting the correct diagnosis. The findings of bronchiectasis and tree-in-bud centrilobular opacities, especially in dependent lung regions, are suggestive of aspiration. Exogenous lipoid pneumonia, most frequently noted in children administered mineral oil for chronic constipation, manifests with consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and crazy-paving on CT (Fig. 17) . The finding of fatty attenuation in the lungs as a sign of lipoid pneumonia on CT is of limited value since it may be either obscured or simulated by volume averaging of nonfatty inflammatory exudate and air (Zanetti et al. 2007; Marchiori et al. 2010 ).",

Imaging findings can include airspace opacities, nodules, septal thickening, cysts, and honeycombing (Fig. 21) . CT is useful for monitoring the response to therapy with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants. Lung biopsy is advocated for children with anemia and pulmonary opacities, hemoptysis, or hemosiderin-laden macrophages on BAL, even in the absence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), Fig. 17 Aspiration pneumonia. Axial chest CT image from a 17-yearold shows widespread crazy-paving from exogenous lipoid pneumonia related to repetitive aspiration of mineral oil administered for constipation since many of these patients will have capillaritis that confers a worse prognosis than IPH (Vece and Fan 2011) . Pulmonary capillaritis is further discussed in the chapter entitled Thoracic Manifestations of Systemic Diseases by Holland, Guillerman, and Brody in this book.",

PVOD can be idiopathic or associated with connective tissue disease, HIV infection, organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or toxic exposures. Patients with PVOD often present with progressive dyspnea with exertion, and delay in diagnosis is common (Woerner et al. 2014) . Typical features of PVOD include normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, low pulmonary diffusing capacity, hypoxemia at rest, desaturation with exercise, and occult alveolar hemorrhage on BAL. Characteristic findings of PVOD on CT include smooth septal thickening, lobular ground-glass opacities, pleural effusions, enlargement of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries and right heart chambers, and normal appearance of the main pulmonary veins and left heart chambers (Frazier et al. 2007; Montani et al. 2009; Woerner et al. 2014) (Fig. 22 ). PVOD accounts for 5-10 % of cases initially suspected as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (Montani et al. 2009 ). It is crucial not to misdiagnose PVOD as idiopathic PAH since the vasodilators used to treat PAH patients can induce fulminant pulmonary edema in patients with PVOD. Pulmonary artery enlargement and mosaic lung attenuation can be seen in either PVOD or PAH, but septal thickening, lobular ground-glass opacities, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusions are typical of PVOD, but not PAH (Frazier et al. 2007) . A presumptive diagnosis of PVOD can be made on the basis of characteristic findings of CT, arterial blood gases, pulmonary function testing, and BAL, thereby avoiding highrisk lung biopsy in these patients. Early recognition is crucial, since PVOD has a poor prognosis with a mean reported survival time of only 14 months after diagnosis, and lung transplantation is the only curative therapy (Montani et al. 2009; Woerner et al. 2014 ).",

Pulmonary lymphangiectasia can be a primary disorder or occur secondary to lymphatic congestion from conditions associated with excessive lung fluid accumulation such as congestive heart failure or obstructed pulmonary veins. Pulmonary lymphangiectasia can also be present as part of the histologic findings in alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) (Dishop 2011) . Pulmonary lymphangiectasia is most often sporadic, but can be associated with genetic disorders, such as Noonan syndrome, yellow nail syndrome, Knobloch syndrome, Urioste syndrome, and mandibulofacial dysostosis. The primary form is typically congenital and may be accompanied by nonimmune hydrops fetalis, congenital chylothorax, or generalized lymphedema (Bellini et al. 2006) . Primary pulmonary lymphangiectasia classically presents in a term neonate with severe respiratory distress, tachypnea, cyanosis, and diffuse hazy opacification of the lungs on CXR resembling the findings of surfactant deficiency of prematurity or a genetic disorder of surfactant metabolism. CT reveals smooth septal thickening, bronchovascular bundle thickening, patchy ground-glass opacities, and pleural effusion .

An axial CT image from a 13-year-old with cough and a family history of pulmonary fibrosis demonstrates peripheral fine, linear, and ground-glass opacities bilaterally along with scattered tiny cysts and volume loss of the left lung Fig. 21 Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. A frontal CXR (a) of a 1-year-old with anemia and a corresponding axial chest CT image (b) show patchy pulmonary airspace opacities, more extensive on the left, related to intra-alveolar pulmonary hemorrhage thickening become less marked, and hyperinflation develops in those surviving infancy or presenting later in childhood (Fig. 23) . Treatment of primary pulmonary lymphangiectasia is generally supportive, and the overall prognosis is poor (Mettauer et al. 2009 ).",
