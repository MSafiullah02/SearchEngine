It is responsible for increasing hospital length of stay and costs [1, 2]. Many efforts are still being performed to reduce their burden, especially using prevention bundles [3, 4], which have been shown to be effective in reducing its rate. VAP is a continuous process presenting with nonspecific clinical features [5], with some limitations regarding its definition and diagnosis, because gold-standard tests are still lacking. It is also missing clear evidence to prioritize diagnostic tests and how they impact clinical outcomes. As evidence is weak, expert opinion should be taken into account. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is widely used in decision-making in various areas in order to rank priorities and is also used in medicine with the same purpose putting together evidence and expert opinion [6, 7].",

Diagnostic tests were evaluated individually against priority criteria, by each expert. These results were then multiplied by the weight of each priority criterion to obtain individual scores for each diagnostic test. Then, sum score was obtained after addition of all the partial scores previously achieved. Each variable was transformed into a 0\u201310 scale in order to facilitate their comparison. All responses are categorical variables since they are reported using descriptive statistics (proportions and percentages).

Our results are in line with the ECDC strategy [15], which preserves chest imaging as a key for VAP surveillance and also with studies showing different prognosis of VAP and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis [16]. In spite of this controversy, it is pertinent to keep in mind that VAP surveillance and diagnosis or clinical management are different approaches. Important to note that, despite lung ultrasound (LUS) use is increasing [17], in our study experts ranked as the least important imaging technique.

Meanwhile, biomarkers are abundantly used worldwide in VAP diagnosis, despite clear evidence proving that their positive impact on outcomes had never been published [18]. Most of our panel declared the use of WBC, CRP, and PCT in clinical practice, in spite of MCDA showed a preference by CRP and PCT. This could be explained by their low cost, and also, their use is generally intended as a good clinical practice (as some behaviors in medicine that are not supported by high-quality evidence). Differently, IL6, IL10, and Pro-adrenomedullin remain usefulness tools beyond investigational purposes.",

            "text": "Microbiological cultures and tests remain one of the most divergent issues in different guidelines [9\u201311]. Blood cultures, despite infrequently positive, were previously recognized as important tools in VAP [19], since bacteremic VAP is associated with higher mortality [20]. Although, in our MCDA experts ranked blood cultures as the most important culture specimen, when asked about their preferences in VAP diagnosis, blood cultures were only the fourth preferred. Between the other methods of specimens\u2019 collection for culture, endotracheal aspirate score first in MCDA, at the same time as BAL and mini-BAL were the preferred (by this order) invasive techniques. This can be related to the controversy about this issue in international guidelines. While American guidelines [10] recommend noninvasive and semi-quantitative sampling, European guidelines [9] recommend invasive and quantitative sampling. Interestingly, both are qualified as \u201cWeak recommendation\u201d and \u201cLow-quality evidence\u201d, exposing that this concerning issue recommendation is more associated with divergent interpretation than different recognized evidence.",

This represents an important field, as in some places professionals lack experience in bronchoscopic BAL or if experienced operators are not always present. Besides cost and availability were out of the highest experts priorities, very specific tests as PCR tests and multiplex PCR were not in the top priorities regarding microbiological techniques. Timely results are of the highest importance in critically ill patient outcomes [21, 22] and also in reducing antibiotic pressure; therefore, the need for timely results is a relevant issue. In this subject, Gram stain, PCR tests, and Multiplex PCR that are able to produce results within 1\u20132 h can have a special role. Notwithstanding, it is also important to take into account local microbiology because tools like Gene Expert \u00ae for ESBL can be prioritized in some places.",
