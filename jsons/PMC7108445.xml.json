The transformation and combustion of fossil fuels are amongst the main sources worldwide impacting upon PM and are studied widely because of the increasing demand for energy driven by industrialised countries and the economic growth of emerging regions. Besides the well-recognised sources which combust fossil fuels (e.g., road traffic, shipping, industries, domestic heating), aviation deserves particular attention because of the rapid growth of civil aviation. Despite the occurrence of events of global impact, such as the terrorist attack of 11th September 2011, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002\u20132003 and the recent global economic crisis (2008\u20132009), civil aviation has experienced an almost constant growth from the 1930s to present day. This trend (about +5% every year) is expected to continue over the next decades (Lee et al., 2009).",

In the lower troposphere, civil aviation has more local effects, which are mainly attributed to the noise and the deterioration of air quality at ground-level due to airport operations. Up to today, many studies have been reported on aircraft engine exhaust emissions (Masiol and Harrison, 2014 and references therein), and emission standards for new types of aircraft engine have been implemented since the late 1970s for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), unburned hydrocarbons and smoke number (ICAO, 2008).",

The sampling site location (Fig. 1) was the best compromise between stringent safety measures for flights and scientific purposes. Sea breezes occur during daytime approx. from April to October and blow air masses from the Adriatic Sea to the mainland (Fig. SI1). Aircraft mostly used the runway 04L (landing and takeoff direction predominantly from SW to NE). During the sampling campaign, \u223c300 aircraft used the runway 22R (opposite direction to 04L, from NE to SW) out of a total of \u223c9500 flight movements (\u223c3.2%). Under such circumstances, the site was chosen to catch the aircraft plumes and was set in a place downwind of the latter part of the taxiway and the beginning of the runway, where aircraft run their engines at 100% thrust during take-off or where the wheels hit the ground during landing causing smoke clearly visible to the naked eye. This choice was further supported by a modelling study (Pecorari et al., 2015) reporting that the site is affected by aircraft engine plumes for gaseous pollutants. A more detailed analysis of civil aviation traffic and wind direction is provided in Fig. SI2: results indicate that a significant number of both takeoffs and landings occurred when the sampling site is downwind of the runway (winds from \u223c45\u00b0 to 160\u00b0).",

The period is representative of typical summer wind regimes (Fig. SI1), when air masses prevalently blow from NE at nighttime and from SSE during daytime. Ultrafine particle counts and their size distributions from 14.3 to 673.2 nm were measured at 5 min time resolution using a scanning mobility particle sizer spectrometer (SMPS) comprising a TSI 3080 electrostatic classifier, a TSI 3081 differential mobility analyzer (long DMA), a TSI 3087 X-ray aerosol neutraliser and a TSI 3022A condensation particle counter (CPC) based on n-butyl alcohol (Fisher Scientific, ACS) condensation. The range of size spectra were complemented by a TSI aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) 3321 which measures particle diameters within the range 0.5\u201319.8 \u03bcm. BC was continuously measured in PM with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) with 5 min resolution using a 7-wavelength aethalometer (Magee Scientific AE31). Instrumental set-up: the SMPS operated at a sheath air to aerosol flow ratio of 10:1 (sheath and sample air flow rates were 3.0 and 0.3 L min\u22121 respectively, voltage 10\u20139591 V; density 1.2 g cc\u22121 ; scan time 120 s, retrace 15 s; number of scan 2) while CPC operated at low flow rate (0.3 L min\u22121).

In this way, unmerged spectra have been used also in previous source apportionment studies (e.g., Zhou et al., 2004, Ogulei et al., 2006). Input data were initially handled by averaging groups of three consecutive bins. This procedure has some advantages: (i) reduces the number of variables processed by the PMF, (ii) minimises the noise of raw SMPS data, which may cause high variability amongst consecutive bins and (iii) limits the number of null values (zeros) which are sometimes recorded in the more coarse bins of the SMPS and APS. This way, a total of 51 bins were used as input for PMF: 34 bins from the SMPS ranging from 14.6 nm to 552.3 nm and 17 bins from the APS (0.5\u201319.8 \u03bcm). In addition the total variable (total number of particles) was calculated by summing the concentrations of each size bin adjusted with the appropriate multipliers accounting for channel resolutions of the SMPS and APS.",

Essentially, the methodology aims to group single PNSD spectra (SMPS + APS data, 5 min-resolved observations, in this case) into a number k of clusters. The partition of each observation into a cluster is based on the similarity of the PNSD spectra with the cluster centroids (means), i.e. the method is optimised to group similarly-shaped PNSD spectra into the same cluster. This strategy has the advantage to group observations with similar spectra, which are likely to be originated by the same set of emission sources or formation processes. The optimum number of clusters was determined by an optimisation algorithm based on the shape of the spectra (Beddows et al., 2009).",

Nucleation range particles show an evident increase during daytime, which is broadly comparable with the diurnal pattern in solar irradiance. Similar diurnal cycles have been observed in other studies (e.g., Kulmala and Kerminen, 2008, Chen et al., 2011, Hirsikko et al., 2013) and have been attributed to nucleation events driven by photochemical reactions and possibly assisted by turbulent mixing in the atmosphere (Janssen et al., 2012). However, the diurnal cycle of nucleation particles is also very similar to that of air traffic intensity. Aitken, accumulation and coarse particles, CO, nitrogen oxides and BC exhibit highest concentrations in the early morning and secondarily in the evening. These patterns are mainly driven by the interaction of emissions, dispersion and atmospheric chemical processes. Similar diurnal cycles have been previously observed at an urban background site in Mestre-Venice for gaseous pollutants (Masiol et al., 2014b). Following the complex photochemistry of the NO-NO2-O3 system, the cycle of O3, which show a daily peak in the afternoon, is the inverse of the cycle of traffic emissions. Despite the very low concentrations of SO2 normally recorded over the study area, a daily cycle similar to ozone can be identified. Since the daylight hours of the warm season are characterised by the presence of sea breezes, an influence of the local circulation pattern on the levels of O3 and SO2 should be further considered. Fig. 2b also shows the daily pattern of wind, showing highest speeds in the afternoon (average 3.5 m s\u22121), which are mainly caused by the influence of sea breezes.",

            "text": "Derived parameters are also show in Fig. 2. The NO2/NOx ratio is indicative of the partitioning of nitrogen oxides. In Europe, despite the efforts to lower the NOx emissions, NO2 levels do not yet meet the targets in many locations, including the study area. This is attributed to a discrepancy between achieving NOx emission reductions and NO2 ambient concentrations (e.g., Grice et al., 2009, Cyrys et al., 2012), which has been related to the growing proportion of diesel-powered vehicles with known high primary (direct) emissions of NO2 (Carslaw et al., 2007). In the study area (Province of Venice), the emission inventories for 2007/8 (ARPAV, 2014) indicated a cumulative emission of 24.4 Gg NOx y\u22121, mainly attributed to road transport (37%), combustion in energy and transformation industries (24%) and other mobile sources and machinery (21%). Airport emissions fall into this latter category: aircraft engines emit NOx, and emissions increase with engine thrust, i.e. are higher during take-off and lower in taxi and idle phases. The NO-NO2 partitioning in the emissions of modern high by-pass turbofan engines is also thrust-dependent: NO2 is principally emitted at idle, while NO is dominant at higher thrust regimes (Wormhoudt et al., 2007). At a first glance, the diurnal profile of NO2/NOx ratio can be related to airport emissions due to takeoffs (higher NO), however the daily pattern and value of the ratio are similar to those observed at an urban background site in Mestre-Venice (Masiol et al., 2014b), indicating that vehicular traffic is probably the most influential source. The level of total oxidants (OX = O3 + NO2, in ppbv) is useful to assess the oxidative potential in the atmosphere (Kley et al., 1999). Results show that OX levels are mainly driven by ozone and highest concentrations are recorded in the afternoon.",

Polar plots essentially map the pollutant concentrations by wind speed and direction as a continuous surface (Carslaw and Ropkins, 2012). Polar annuli map the average levels of pollutants by wind direction and hours of the day. Generally, most air pollutants (NO, NO2, OX, SO2 and PNC) show increasing average concentrations for winds blowing from the SE and SW quadrants, CO decreases for moderate winds from the South and stronger winds from NW, ozone shows no prevalent sector but increases with wind speed, while PM2.5 and BC increase in calm wind periods and for moderate/strong winds from E, W and S. In particular, some important insights into the location of potential sources can be extracted from the polar plot analysis:\u2022NO increases towards the ESE, i.e. from the beginning of the runway, where aircraft generally stop and speed up the engines at full power before takeoff. This finding is also evident if considering the partitioning of NOx, which shows a remarkable drop of NO2/NOx toward the runway, indicative of a local source. In addition, NO also increases toward the S-SW sector probably because of emissions of road traffic in Mestre and shipping in Venice;\u2022Despite its very low concentration, SO2 (an excellent tracer for shipping, aircraft and oil refineries) seems to be related more to industrial emissions (SW quadrant) and to the Port of Venice (SE), than to the airport activities (quadrant to NE);\u2022PNC increases toward the SE and SW quadrants, particularly for strong winds from the South, and to a minor extent, from the NE quadrant. These finding suggest that airport activities are not the main source of particles in the area;\u2022PM2.5 increases towards the East, South and West. Although increases from S and W can be related to external sources such as main roads and urban settlements, the high levels recorded towards the East, which roughly corresponds to the section of runway where planes generally land, may relate to aircraft emissions during landing.\n",

Medians, 25th and 75th percentiles for SMPS and APS data were then merged using the algorithm developed by Beddows et al. (2010), which also returns the particle volume concentrations (PVSDs). Results show a significant variation in diurnal modal structures of PNSDs with a main mode ranging from below 14 nm in the daytime periods to \u223c40\u201350 nm during nighttime and early morning. There are two main reasons for this results: (i) the increased airport activities (6 a.m.\u201310 p.m.) emitting fresh nucleation particles, as reported by several studies (e.g., Anderson et al., 2005, Kinsey et al., 2010, Mazaheri et al., 2013) and (ii) the potential role of nucleation processes during daytime. In this latter context, the diurnal occurrence of sea breezes cannot be disregarded since it may have a potential role in transporting fresh air masses from the Adriatic Sea and the nearby lagoon, which are affected by large tidal cycles and are known sources of aerosol precursor compounds. The production of secondary ultrafine particles may occur in the marine boundary layer by the nucleation of low vapour pressure gases produced naturally (but also of anthropogenic origin) (e.g., O\u2019Dowd and De Leeuw, 2007, Modini et al., 2009): through (1) homogeneous nucleation and (2) the subsequent particle growth via a number of mechanisms and scavenging of clusters by larger pre-existing particles. However, the diurnal variations may also be linked to the main (primary) emission sources in the study area, i.e. mobile emissions either from road or maritime sources (commercial and tourist ships, private and public transport boats). On the contrary, PVSDs seem to undergo only modest changes throughout the day, with two main modes at 300\u2013400 nm and 3\u20135 \u03bcm.",

Daytime nucleation events forming particles below 15 nm are often observed in coastal environments and are associated with high \u2022OH radical and SO2 concentrations, but also with iodine oxide gas-phase processes (O\u2019Dowd et al., 1999, O\u2019Dowd and Hoffmann, 2006).

Midday nucleation events start at noon with a huge increment of PNC in the finest nucleation range and, then, particles generally continue to grow over the afternoon, evening and overnight to reach the Aitken and accumulation ranges. Most of the time, cluster 5 observations become dominant for several hours (generally from 4 to 8 h after the event), but the nucleation event generally lasts less than 24 h.",

However, they present different PNSD spectra. Cluster 2 links spectra characterised by a particles in the nucleation range and peaking below the minimum detection diameter of the SMPS (14 nm), while cluster 4 groups spectra showing a primary mode at 60\u2013100 nm and, secondarily, below 14 nm. Most of the literature reports that aircraft engine exhausts emit particles in the nucleation range (Kinsey et al., 2010, Mazaheri et al., 2013, Masiol and Harrison, 2014, Lobo et al., 2012, Lobo et al., 2015), however, some studies also report a second mode in the accumulation range (e.g., Mazaheri et al., 2009). Looking at the aircraft traffic provided by the airport, it is clear that the hourly counts of cluster 2 well relate with the aircraft movements (Fig. 2 and SI2). On the contrary, hourly counts for cluster 4 are pretty constant through the day (Fig. 5) and the wind rose also recorded counts for winds blowing from the NNE sector, i.e. toward the airport terminal and aircraft park areas. In this light, it can be hypothesized that cluster 2 represents fresh emissions from taking-off or landing aircraft, whereas, cluster 4 is more related to background levels of particles due to the taxi phases and operations at the gates.",

Results show that the spectra are mainly caused by direct emissions, e.g., road and airport traffic (clusters 1, 2) or atmospheric processes, e.g., mixing layer height and air temperature (cluster 3) and midday nucleation events (cluster 5). However, in an environment with very large anthropogenic influences like VCE, it is likely that spectra can be either influenced by single sources/processes or concurrently shaped by multiple sources. Consequently, PMF analysis may yield the most robust information on the probable sources.",

Convergence of the final PMF solution was then ensured over multiple runs for the 6-factor solution using a random starting seed. PMF results were carefully checked by investigating the base model displacement error estimation (DISP) and bootstrapping (BS) error estimation (Paatero et al., 2014, Brown et al., 2015). Diagnostics reported that: (i) no factor swaps occurred for DISP analysis indicating that there are not significant rotational ambiguities and the solution is sufficiently robust to be used; (ii) factor mapping from the BS runs suggested that the BS uncertainties can be interpreted and the selected number of factors is appropriate. PMF rotational ambiguities were further assessed by varying the FPEAK value (Paatero et al., 2002) between \u22125 and 10 and checking the relative changes in Q, the total number of negative contributions and the G-space plots for edges. The more physically realistic and independent solutions were obtained for FPEAK = 2.5. Uncertainties of FPEAK-rotated solutions were finally estimated over n = 200 BS runs.",

Airport traffic was elaborated to return the more plausible number of aircraft movements every 5 min and takes in account the exact timing of each movement. Traffic data include the timings of landing and parking at the terminal (for arrivals) and the timings of departure from gates and take-off (for departures). This way, each movement was adjusted for the real time that each aircraft was moving. The dataset was also handled to maximise the signal of aircraft, i.e. selecting hours with high airport traffic (10 a.m.\u20139 p.m.) and wind regimes blowing air masses from the taxiway and runway to the sampling site (45\u2013170\u00b0). No one factor showed significant (p < 0.001) strong (\u03c1 > 0.6) or even weak (0.35 < \u03c1 < 0.6) correlation with airport traffic. This result may be explained by a number of reasons: (i) airport emissions are complicated to model and predict due to the large number of different phases in the LTO cycles: even if it possible to know the exact time of each movement, it is difficult to predict the timing and the relative position of aircraft at different phases (e.g., the time spent by aircraft in the queue at the beginning of the runway was not recorded or when they are exactly upwind of the sampling site); (ii) although aircraft engines are expected to be the larger contributors to the air pollution at the airport, other sources may interfere by emitting particles with similar size distributions and, then, adding noise to the PMF results (e.g., the aircraft auxiliary power units (APU), which are small on-board turbines providing a source of electrical power and compressed air when aircraft are parked at the gate and sometimes during taxi); (iii) other strong sources are present in the study area; (iv) wind data are recorded hourly and then interpolated for obtaining 5 min time resolution, therefore unknown discrepancies may occur between estimated and real wind data. This latter point was overcome by investigating 1 h-averaged traffic and PMF data, but correlations were still low for all of the factors.",

However, its contribution to the volume distribution is \u223c1%. This factor shows significant (p < 0.001) but weak (0.35 < \u03c1 < 0.6) positive correlations with NO (but not NO2), OX, solar irradiance, air temperature and exhibits an evident diurnal variation peaking at 1 p.m. and higher levels during the afternoon. The polar plot analysis (Fig. 8) indicates enhanced levels when winds blow from the SW and SE quadrants: whilst the increase from the SE quadrant arises for high wind speeds (>5 m s\u22121) towards the airfield, the increase in the SW quadrant occurs for lower speeds (3\u20135 m s\u22121). The polar annulus analysis indicates that the higher concentrations are for winds blowing from S to SW at 12 noon-4 p.m. This behaviour is consistent with the location of several anthropogenic sources in the study area which can contribute to particles in the nucleation range, i.e. the road traffic in the urban area of Mestre (toward SW), the stack emissions from the industrial area (SW), shipping in Venice and its tourist harbour (S) and the airport activities and aircraft movements (SE). In this context, particles peaking in the nucleation range have been observed for multiple anthropogenic sources: (i) fresh diesel engines (Shi and Harrison, 1999), (ii) diesel-equipped boats at high engine loads (Petzold et al., 2010), (iii) coal-fired power plants (Nielsen et al., 2002, Liu et al., 2010) aircraft (Anderson et al., 2005, Kinsey et al., 2010, Mazaheri et al., 2013, Lobo et al., 2015). However, particles in this size range may also originate from photochemically-driven nucleation processes. The profile for this factor relates well to the shapes grouped in the cluster 5 in the k-means cluster analysis (midday nucleation events). The polar plot for this factor (Fig. 8) also shows the highest intensity in areas of the plot showing the lowest PM2.5 concentrations (Fig. 3). This is consistent with nucleation being favoured by a low condensation sink (Dall\u2019Osto et al., 2013).",

A similar sampling campaign was carried out in July 2014 at a kerbside site in the urban area of Mestre using a similar set of instruments (SMPS, aethalometer). Preliminary results of this study are provided as supplementary material: Fig. SI6 shows the map of the sampling location, while Fig. SI7 reports the \u201cnucleation factor\u201d extracted by applying PMF analysis to SMPS data. These results show an identical size distribution (particles peaking at 15\u201320 nm) with a similar daily pattern (main peak at noon-1 p.m. followed by a second minor peak at 6\u20137 a.m.). However, the polar plot analysis significantly differs showing strong increases for winds blowing from the SE, i.e. the direction of the industrial zone. Since the kerbside site is located 9.5 km WSW from VCE and weather conditions were very similar (summer sea/land breeze regime), an origin of factor 1 from airport activities is not consistent with the results. An origin from the industrial zone is plausible. As already reported, a large coal-fired power plant and an oil refinery are located in the industrial area of Porto Marghera and both installations are potential sources of particles in the nucleation range (Nielsen et al., 2002, Liu et al., 2010, Cheung et al., 2012) and SO2. Emission inventories for 2010 (ARPAV \u2013 Regione Veneto, 2015) reported that combustion in energy and transformation industries accounts for \u223c72% of total SO2 emissions in the Venice Province. It has been reported that the probability of nucleation is increased by elevated SO2 concentrations (e.g., Stanier et al., 2004) and a 13 year-long monitoring of airborne pollutants conducted in Mestre (Masiol et al., 2014b) reported evident peaks of SO2 for winds blowing from the industrial zone. A large influence of oil refineries and/or coal-fired power plants upon the particle number concentrations in the nucleation range have been observed in many parts of the world (e.g., Stevens et al., 2012, Cheung et al., 2012, Gonz\u00e1lez and Rodr\u00edguez, 2013).",

However, beside its main probable origin from photochemical nucleation of SO2, the directional analysis (Fig. 8) further suggests that this factor might also be also secondarily associated with locally-emitting primary anthropogenic sources.",

In addition, the polar plot for factor 1 also shows minor increases towards the airfield for strong winds. The sulphur content in jet fuel is limited to 3000 ppm and is commonly reported within the range 300\u20131100 ppm (Masiol and Harrison, 2014, and reference therein), which is approximately 30\u2013100 times higher than that for automotive fuels (<10 ppm).

Several observations link this factor to road traffic: (i) correlation analysis shows significant moderate positive associations with NO2 (\u03c1 = 0.44) and BC (\u03c1 = 0.41), which are pollutants primarily emitted by road traffic (mainly diesel); (ii) such correlations have maxima at 0 h lag, suggesting covariant sources (Fig. 9); (iii) the diurnal variations reveal a typical cycle common to traffic-related sources (morning and evening rush traffic hours); (iv) the directional analysis shows increased levels when air masses move from the main populated sectors of the mainland, i.e. the urban area of Mestre (SW), and several mains road towards the N and (v) the factor profile is very similar to the cluster 1 (road traffic) extracted by the k-mean cluster analysis.

A number of studies have associated particles in this size range with marine traffic. Jonsson et al. (2011) reported that emissions from cargo and passenger ships peak at \u223c35 nm; Healy et al. (2009) observed ship exhaust particle number distributions with a maximum at approximately 50 nm; Kasper et al.

The same results were also reported by Lyyr\u00e4nen et al. (1999), who investigated the mechanisms of particle formation during combustion within marine diesel engines affected by hot corrosion and erosion. In the light of this, besides road traffic, factor 2 can be also linked to the marine traffic emissions from ships, waterbuses and boats of public or private transport services, which are commonly equipped with marine diesel engines. Currently, the contribution of the Port of Venice to the levels of PM is heavily debated (Contini et al., 2015) and information on the emissions from waterbuses and the private boat fleet is still lacking (Pecorari et al., 2013a). Factor 2 was interpreted as road + shipping traffic, mainly due to diesel engine emissions.",

            "text": "The third factor shows a main mode in the number distribution at 80 nm and a second mode in the nucleation range, which seems to extend beyond the lower limit of particle detection of the SMPS (14.6 nm). Three modes in the volume distribution are found at approx. 200, 500 nm and 5 \u03bcm. Its contributions to the particle number and volume are 20.3% (c.i.95 20.1\u201320.5%) and 19.6%, respectively. This factor lacks relevant correlations with other air pollutants and its diurnal cycle is relatively constant through the early part of the day, with a strong decrease in the early afternoon following the increased wind speeds due to the sea breezes. Several studies available from the current literature report that aircraft engine emissions show a main mode in the nucleation range (Masiol and Harrison, 2014; and references therein; Lobo et al., 2015). However, despite the particle size profile of factor 3 differing from those commonly reported in the literature for aircraft emissions, there are a number of a reasons for attributing this factor to the airport emissions:\u2022The polar plot exhibits the main contributions when air masses blow from the airfield (E to SSE) and from the main airport terminal (NE), while the polar annulus clearly shows that maximum levels for winds blowing from the airfield are reached in the central hours of the day, i.e. during the busy airport hours. No other factors show polar plots consistent with aircraft emissions.\u2022Some studies also report the presence of a second mode in the accumulation range for aircraft exhausts (Kinsey et al., 2010, Lobo et al., 2012, Mazaheri et al., 2013). For example, in a study conducted at the Brisbane airport (Australia), Mazaheri et al. (2009) investigated a total of 283 individual aircraft plumes during landing and takeoff (LTO) cycles and reported accumulation modes between 40 and 100 nm, more pronounced in particle number size distributions during takeoffs. These findings are also consistent with Herndon et al. (2008), who studied the emissions from in-use commercial aircraft engines downwind of operational taxi- and runways at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport (USA) and reported the presence of a mode at \u223c65 nm associated with takeoff plumes and a smaller mode at \u223c25 nm associated with idle. Comparing the profile of factor 3 with clustering results, it can be noted that it fits profiles for both cluster 2 and 4 (aircraft and airport-related shapes). In particular, looking at the diurnal variations, factor 3 seems more related with cluster 4 than with cluster 2. Although factor 3 lacks a main peak in the nucleation range, its fingerprint (Fig. 7) shows the presence of a significant second mode for particles below 14 nm, which may represent the main peak in the nucleation range reported in the literature for aircraft emissions. An apparent shift towards smaller particle sizes can be attributed to evaporative shrinkage of particles before the exhaust plumes reached the sampling site (Dall\u2019Osto et al., 2011, Harrison et al., 2016). In this context, the total number of particles attributed by our study to the aircraft exhaust emissions will be underestimated because the lower limit of detection of SMPS curtails this second peak below 14 nm.\n",

Moreover, the peaks in particle volume at 500 nm and 5 \u03bcm can be tentatively attributed to the brake dust and tyre wear during landing and to the dust resuspension due to the turbulence created by the aircraft movements, respectively.

It has two modes in the number distribution (30 and 200 nm) and a main mode in the volume distribution (400 nm). Polar plot analysis does not reveal any significant directionality toward specific local sources, but shows a marked boost during wind calm hours (\u03c1\nwind speed = \u22120.54) and low winds from the NNE. The daily pattern is the mirror image of the air temperature, and it is positively correlated with NO2 (but not with NO), PM2.5 and BC and negatively correlated with O3, OX and SO2. The factor 4 can be related to the cluster 3 (nighttime pollution): they match for the 30 nm peak and they show the same diurnal patterns. These results raise the following issues: (i) the higher levels reached in calm and low wind periods may suggest that the origin of the factor is local rather than external or linked to regional transport; (ii) an origin from the airport can be excluded because of the diurnal profile (very limited airport traffic recorded overnight); (iii) the directionality toward NNE, where there are no significant emission sources, may indicate that such a factor is not linked to freshly emitted pollutant. The peak intensity during the nighttime and the significant, but weak, association with NO2 are highly consistent with the chemistry driving the heterogeneous reactions of N2O5 and NO3 on aerosol surfaces (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006, Bertram and Thornton, 2009, Brown and Stutz, 2012). This process has been observed in many polluted areas (e.g., Fine et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2009). In particular, Dall\u2019Osto et al. (2009) observed that most nitrate particles in London are: (i) locally produced in urban locations during nighttime; (ii) mainly present in particles smaller than 300 nm and (iii) internally mixed with sulphate, ammonium, elemental and organic carbon. Therefore, this factor clearly depicts the condensation of secondary nitrate on pre-existing particles occurring overnight and enhanced by the air temperatures below 20 \u00b0C. The analysis of CCF (Fig. 9) confirms this interpretation by revealing a delay of about 2 h in maximum negative correlations with ambient temperature, which is likely linked to the time needed for the heterogeneous reactions on the surface of particles. Moreover, it would be expected that nitrate-containing particles can subsequently undergo evaporation during daytime. This latter interpretation relates well to a recent study by Squizzato et al. (2013), who reported low levels of PM2.5-bound nitrate in Venice during the warm season because of the partitioning of nitrate towards the gas-phase.",

The high correlation with BC (\u03c1 = 0.64 with maximum correlations at 0 h lags) suggests that BC particles have a key role in the formation processes by acting as condensation nuclei for nitrate aerosol. BC is a primary pollutant and is therefore directly emitted from specific combustion sources: in the study area principally industries (mainly coal power plant), shipping and traffic. However, none of these primary sources are located toward the NNE. This correlation is mostly driven by the concurrent effects of the nocturnal circulation (prevalent winds blowing from the NNE) and the lower mixing layer height reached in the coldest nighttime hours (typically at 6 a.m.). In the warmest season, the mixing height over the study area may reach 1 km or more during daytime, allowing a greater dispersion of pollutants emitted at the ground, whereas it drops down to below 100 m or less during night (Pecorari et al., 2013b). Therefore it can be speculated that locally-emitted BC particles and NOx undergo a wide dispersion within the expanded mixing layer during the daytime and move toward the mainland because of the sea breezes. Overnight, the reduction of the mixing layer height restricts BC and nitrogen oxides emissions to a layer close to ground level. In this scenario, both the reduction in air temperatures and the increased concentrations of NOx (Fig. 2b) potentially boost the formation of nitrate aerosol in the particle-phase on BC nuclei.",

Their contributions to the total particle volume concentrations are 21.1% and 12.2%, respectively, while their shares of PNC are negligible (3 and 1.5%, respectively). Apparently, both factors also show increased levels with high winds blowing from the first NE sector and diurnal cycles inverse to the air temperature. However, despite most factors showing repetitive or cyclic daily variations, factor 5 does not present a regular diurnal pattern, but exhibits two relatively short periods with very high contributions: 18\u201319 and 23\u201324 May. This result may indicate that it is not necessarily linked with local stationary sources and not strongly affected by micro- or meso-scale weather conditions, such as breezes. Consequently, the potential origin of this factor was investigated through the concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis of the back-trajectories. Details of the adopted method are provided in Hsu et al. (2003). Results reveal a potential regional origin from Central Italy (Fig. SI8), but also increased levels when air masses move from some populated areas of Central Europe. The best interpretation for this factor is therefore the regional/transboundary pollution transport across Italy and/or Europe.",

Super-micrometre particles are likely emitted from non-combustion sources. The daily cycle is very similar to that of nighttime nitrate (factor 4), BC and NO2, but no correlations are significantly high with those variables. On the contrary, factor 6 clearly shows weak negative correlations with O3, OX, wind speed, solar irradiance and air temperature. Strong winds from the NNE bring air masses from agricultural fields as well as from some places in the surroundings of the airport affected by work during the sampling campaign. Consequently, the most plausible interpretation for factor 6 is the local resuspension of large dust particles, presumed to be of crustal origin. The diurnal pattern is explained by the fact that land breezes occur at nighttime, only linking source areas to the sampling site at this time of day.",

            "text": "Similar to PMF factor 4, BC levels peak at 6\u20137 a.m. (Fig. 2, Fig. 8), when ambient temperature drops to the daily minimum. The analysis of the polar plot for BC (Fig. 3) does not reveal substantial increases of concentration in any direction, but a marked rise in levels during calm wind periods. An estimation of the relative contributions of local sources upon the BC levels was then made by comparing data for winds blowing from differing sectors. Six sectors were identified according to the location of the main sources of the study area: (i) the urban area of Mestre as representative of traffic-related emissions; (ii) the main industrial zone of Porto Marghera; (iii) Venice as representative of urban emissions and shipping; (iv) the Island of Murano for glassmaking emissions; (v) the VCE airfield comprising runway, taxiway and the main terminals and (vi) remaining sector. Selected sectors and polar annulus results are provided in Table 3\nand Fig. SI3, respectively. Data were also filtered for wind speed >1 m s\u22121 to remove wind calm periods. Results (Fig. 10\n) show that the BC levels are higher when air masses arise from the \u2018other direction\u2019 sector, while they are almost constant for sectors indicative of each specific local anthropogenic source. This result is quite unexpected as soot particles are known to be emitted by most combustion sources in the area, e.g., road traffic (Pant and Harrison, 2013), aircraft (Masiol and Harrison, 2014), and ships (Lack and Corbett, 2012), while emissions from wood combustion due to domestic heating and open burning are negligible in warm periods. During daytime, none of the local sources seems to have a dominant role in influencing the levels of atmospheric soot, while the nocturnal circulation (slow winds prevalently from NNE) and the lower mixing layer height (ca. 100 m) at nighttime restricts soot particles to the surface layer close to the ground.",

The main results can be summarised as follows:\u2022the fingerprint of aircraft emissions on the PNSD sampled in real ambient conditions reveals a main mode at approx. 80 nm and a second mode in the nucleation range below the lower limit for particle detection of the SMPS (<14 nm). Air traffic contributes about 22% of PNC, but does not contribute significantly to the mass concentrations of black carbon. However, the size distribution fingerprint could be affected by evaporative processes which have shifted the particle size below 14 nm and, thus, the total amount of particles emitted by the airport could be underestimated;\u2022nucleation particles with a mode at 15\u201320 nm are the main contributors to PNC (44%) and may be linked to both photochemical nucleation from precursor gases and the evolution of primary particles emitted by several combustion processes and undergoing condensation/evaporation/dilution processes after emission. Cluster analysis has helped to identify and quantify the midday nucleation episodes, which were recorded for about 40% of sampling days;\u2022the emissions of road traffic from the main urban area and shipping traffic around the city of Venice contributes \u223c26% of PNC (mode at 35\u201340 nm);\u2022Coarse particles originated from nighttime nitrate formation and from resuspension advected by regional transport are the main contributors to the particle volume concentrations and, therefore, mass concentrations, as clearly indicated by significant positive correlations with PM2.5;\u2022levels of black carbon are strongly associated with the dynamics of the mixing layer, while no specific local sources can be identified as dominant in the study area. BC also has an important role by providing condensation nuclei for nighttime secondary nitrate aerosol formation.\n",

Beside aircraft traffic, airports are often located near major cities and attract large volumes of road traffic, which are additive to the local pollution. Furthermore, micro- and meso-scale meteorology may move, mix and transform emitted primary pollutants. It is therefore very difficult to differentiate between pollutants arising from airport operations and those from other local sources. The approaches proposed in this study have successfully identified and apportioned the main potential sources in an area affected by a complex emission scenario and the results can be utilised to plan local air pollution control measures.",

Although such techniques are widely used to detect and quantify the sources of airborne particles (both for mass and number concentrations), their application to data collected near airports, or even inside the airfields, is still very limited. There are a number of reasons for this as studies at airports must face several issues: (i) the need of specific authorisations to enter the airport area for carrying chemical substances and/or radioactive sources required by some scientific equipment; (ii) the space and time allowed for research is strictly limited for compliance with the strong security standards of airports; (iii) the positioning of sampling sites is also restricted to fulfil security standards. For these reasons, limitations affected this study, such as the length of the sampling campaign and the location of the sampling site. They both represent the best compromise between stringent safety measures for flights and scientific investigation.",
