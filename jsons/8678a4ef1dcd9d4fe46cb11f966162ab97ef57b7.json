As a consequence, there is little information on the replication of these viruses at the cellular and molecular levels. This has also limited the development of detection, diagnostic, and assay technologies. A significant advance involved the recent report of a protocol for the successful preparation of primary cell cultures from the lymphoid (Oka) organ (Nadala et al., 1993; Oka, 1969) . Although the primary lymphoid cell lines could not be passaged, they could be maintained for 3 weeks or longer (Fig. 1A) . Furthermore, the primary lymphoid cell cultures were found to be highly susceptible to certain shrimp viral pathogens, such as the yellow-head virus (YHV) and the Chinese baculovirus (CBV) (or white spot baculovirus), resulting in the production of definite cytopathology (CP) (Fig. 1B) . This then allowed the development of quanta1 assay protocols [tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID,,)] for the measurement of infectious virus (Lu et al., 1995a; Tapay et al., 1996a) .

In virus susceptibility studies of several fish cell lines, the heteroploid EPC cell line was determined to be the most susceptible to RPS and had the highest yield of virus ( Table VI) . The EPC was found to be especially useful for the primary isolation of RPS. While several of the other fish cell lines were susceptible, their yields of infectious RPS were much lower (<lo%). Single-cycle growth studies of RPS in EPC cells showed an eclipse period of 3 hr, followed by a period of exponential growth which was completed by 48 hr postinfection (p.i.), Since the virus uniquely replicates in a fish cell line (EPC) causing distinct cytopathic changes, this has enabled the development of a quantitative plaque assay protocol (Fig. 4) which has greatly facilitated the study of RPS. The efficiency of plating (EOP) of RPS in EPC was determined to be 30 virus particles per infectious unit. The virus was found to be highly fragile, being sensitive to 20% ethyl ether, low pH, repeated freezing and thawing (3x1, to 37\u00b0C (12 hr), and storage at -10\u00b0C (4 weeks) but was stable at -70\u00b0C for several weeks. The buoyant density of RPS in sucrose gradients is 1.19 g/cm3. The molecular weight of the single RNA species of the RPS genome was determined t o be 3.6 X lo6 Da (-10.4 kb), which falls within the genomic range of 3.1 to 4.4 X lo6 Da reported for other rhabdoviruses (Heyward et al., 1979) . The viral RNA is sensitive to ribonuclease, and since it is a rhabdovirus, we can assume that it possesses a negative polarity . Since the replication of RPS in EPC was not inhibited by the DNA antagonist 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (20 pg/ ml), this confirms the RNA genome of the virus. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of RPS proteins revealed the presence of at least four major structural proteins with the following molecular weights (ma): 165, 65.7, 45.1, and 27.8. The number of structural proteins and the electrophoretic profile of RPS are very similar to those of the prototype rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and of the fish rhabdovirus carpio (RC) (also named spring viremia of carp virus, SVCV), both of which belong to the genus Vesiculouirus. In number of structural proteins and electrophoretic profile, they are different from the lyssatype fish rhabdoviruses, infectious hypodermal necrosis virus (IHNV) and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). The lyssa variety is easily distinguished from the vesiculo group in that the matrix proteins are composed of two structural polypeptides, M1 and M2, versus a single polypeptide, M, in the vesiculo group (Lu and Loh, 199413) . Western blot analysis of the electrophoretically separated RPS structural proteins with anti-RPS polyclonal serum revealed, in addition to the four major proteins, an extra viral protein with a molecular weight of 38 kDa. Based upon its molecular weight, this polypeptide was presumed to be nonstructural protein which is present in the vesiculo group of rhabdoviruses. The Western blot technique further revealed that the RPS is partly related to VSV, IHNV, and VHSV. The anti-RPS serum identified the G protein of both IHNV and VHSV and the M protein of VSV. Although the anti-RPS serum cross-reacted with the structural proteins of RC, suggesting a close evolutionary relation of these two viruses, the intensity of reaction to RC was much weaker than that observed with RPS. Serologically, RPS is unrelated to IHNV and VHSV and is closely related to but distinguishable from RC using the plaque reduction and neutralization techniques .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 82, "end": 108, "text": "(Lu and Loh, 1992, 199413;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1506, "text": "(Heyward et al., 1979)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2742, "end": 2762, "text": "(Lu and Loh, 199413)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 296, "text": "Table VI)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 839, "end": 847, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "P. stylirostris, P. vannamei"}, {"text": "A solid-phase enzyme-immunoassay protocol, nitrocellulose-enzyme immunoassayhtreptavidin-biotin (NC-EWSAB), employing a rabbit polyclonal anti-RPS IgG was developed for the diagnosis and detection of RPS (Nadala et al., 1992b) .

An immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) procedure has been successfully used to detect BMN-specific virus antigen in smears or sectioned preparations of affected tissues, such as midgut epithelial cells (Sano et al., 1985; Momoyama, 1988 ). Several isolates of WSBV, a currently important shrimp pathogen, have been made from different species of cultured penaeid shrimp in different parts of Asia and have been given different labels: bacilliform virus (BV) or rod-shaped nuclear virus of Penaeus japonicus (RV-PJ) or penaeid rod-shaped DNA virus (PRDV) from P. japonicus, Japan (Takahashiet al., 1994; Inouyeet al., 1994; Kimuraet al., 1996) ; penaeid hemocytic, rod-shaped virus (PHRV) from hybrids of P. esculentus X P. monodon, Australia (Owens, 1993) ; systemic ectodermal and mesodermal baculovirus (SEMBV) from P. monodon, Thailand (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1995) ; white spot syndrome baculovirus ( WSBV) from P. japonicus, P. monodon, and P. penicillatus ; and Chinese baculovirus (CBV) from P. japonicus, Hawaii, originally obtained from the People's Republic of China (Lu et al., 1997) . Until further characterizations of their serological, biochemical, and genomic properties are made, the isolates may be either related strains of the same virus or identical. A recent report employing an in situ hybridization procedure has presented evidence strongly suggesting that these nonoccluded baculovirus isolates may be closely related variants ( Wongteerasupaya et al., 1996) . All of these isolates cause epizootics and mass mortality in cultured penaeid shrimp. Diseased shrimp show a characteristically abnormal reddish color together with white spots on the inside surface of the carapace (Takahashi et al., 1994; Nakano et al., 1994; Chou et al., 1995) .

A major obstacle to the study of these diseases is the lack of convenient and quantitative methodologies, such as in uitro cell culture systems to grow and study (characterize) the virus. A beginning has been made with the recent development of protocols for the consistent preparation of primary shrimp lymphoid cells, which were employed for the quanta1 assay of some of the shrimp viral pathogens. The primary cell lines have also been used to analyze the synthesis of viral proteins at the cellular level and to study viral pathogenesis. With the further successful development of additional primary cell lines from other shrimp tissues and the establishment of continuous diploid and transformed shrimp cell lines, this problem is being solved. The value of cell culture systems is becoming increasingly clear. They present several obvious advantages: they are more cost effective, sensitive, and convenient than whole animals, particularly for rapid monitoring of infectivity; they yield quantitatively reproducible results; and viral growth kinetics, biochemical and genetic characteristics, and so on can be studied more easily. Their biggest potential use is in future molecular biology and genetic studies of shrimp viruses. These aspects are currently inadequately investigated. It should be emphasized that a major advantage of the cell culture systems is their sensitivity in detecting the viable virion and, consequently, asymptomatic and latent infections, particularly in broodstock populations.
