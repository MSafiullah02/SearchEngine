Recent analyses of several past, emerging, and potentially emerging infectious diseases have been based on serial interval distributions, including the 1918 influenza (Mills et al., 2004) , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Wallinga and Teunis, 2004) , pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (Fraser et al., 2009; McBryde et al., 2009) , and avian influenza (Ferguson et al., 2005 (Ferguson et al., , 2006 . Three methods form the basis of these applications. With a measurement of the exponential growth rate at the beginning of an epidemic and a known serial interval distribution, R 0 can be estimated via the Lotka-Euler equation (Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000; Svensson, 2007; Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007) . Two other methods use the time series of symptom onset times, assuming that all infections are symptomatic and observed. Wallinga and Teunis (2004) estimate R(t) given a known serial interval distribution. Their approach has been adapted by other researchers (Cauchemez et al., 2006) , often supplemented with serial-interval observations from contacttracing data. White and Pagano (2008) jointly estimate R 0 and the serial interval distribution using a branching-process approximation to the initial spread of infection, assuming the number of secondary cases generated by each infectious person has a Poisson distribution with mean R 0 .",

The Lotka-Euler and Wallinga-Teunis estimators rely on a previously known generation serial interval distribution. The Wallinga-Teunis and White-Pagano estimators assume that all serial intervals are independent and identically distributed, which occurs only if the incubation and infectious periods are constant. All three of these estimators assume a stable serial interval distribution, which limits their use to the early spread of infection. When multiple infectious persons compete to infect a given susceptible, the infector is the one who first makes infectious contact. Thus, the mean generation and serial intervals contract as the prevalence of infection increases either locally (e.g., within households) or globally (Svensson, 2007; Kenah et al., 2008) .",

This interval will be right-censored if j is infected by someone else prior to infectious contact from i or if i recovers from infection before making infectious contact with j. The contact interval is similar to the generation interval, except that its definition is not limited to contacts that actually cause infection and it begins with the onset of infectiousness rather than infection.",

If an epidemic model was run 100 times without producing an epidemic final size of at least 1,000, it was discarded and another model was generated.

Assuming a Weibull contact interval distribution, we getR 0 = 3.08 (2.55, 3.65) for Vera Cruz andR 0 = 4.37 (4.06, 4.70) for Mexico City; in both cases, the null hypothesis of an exponential contact interval distribution is strongly rejected (likelihood ratio p-value < .001). The estimates are also sensitive to the assumed infectious period. Assuming a five-day infectious period and a Weibull contact interval distribution, we getR 0 = 3.53 (2.79, 4.30) for Vera Cruz and R 0 = 7.14 (6.63, 7.66) for Mexico City. Subsequent experience shows that these R 0 estimates are far too high. This bias is consistent with the results obtained above when applying mass-action estimates to simulated data generated by network-based models. Since a most influenza transmission takes place in households, workplaces, and schools (Yang et al., 2009 ) the true underlying transmission model is probably closer to a network-based model than a mass-action model. Data on the duration of illness and, more importantly, on the social links between cases would allow better point and interval estimates of R 0 . The estimates could also be improved with incomplete-data methods that took into account the discreteness of the data and allowed variability in latent, incubation, and infectious periods.",

In the mass-action models, performance deteriorated noticeably in moving from exponential to Weibull contact interval distributions, possibly because U (\u03b8 0 , T ) was closer to a normal distribution in the simpler models. No such deterioration was noticeable in the network-based models, possibly due to the addition of contact-tracing information. Our methods were deliberately simple: all point estimates were plug-in estimators and all confidence intervals were based on normal approximations for the joint distributions of the MLEs. More sophisticated methods, such as Bayesian methods, might produce point estimates and confidence intervals whose performance is even better. The methods here would adapt quite well to a Bayesian analysis, and we believe that a Bayesian framework is the most natural setting for the development of methods to analyze partially-observed epidemics.",

It does not apply to many diseases of public health importance, such as tuberculosis, meningococcal or pneumococcal diseases, foodborne or waterborne diseases, or HIV/AIDS. Most (though not all) emerging infections fit into the SEIR framework, and almost all methods currently used to analyze data from emerging epidemics make this assumption. We also assumed that all times of infection, onset of infectiousness, and recovery are observed. This is clearly unsatisfactory, but the development of incomplete-data methods must be based on complete-data methods. In Section 2, we assumed that the contact interval \u03c4 ij is independent of the infectious period \u03b9 i of i. This simplified the likelihoods, but it is probably unrealistic. This problem could be addressed by including \u03b9 i as a covariate in X ij or by using multivariate survival methods. In Section 3, we assumed that the population is homogeneous. This simplified the estimation of R 0 , but it is also unrealistic. In a heterogeneous population, estimates of R 0 would have to include the distribution of relevant covariates in the population.",
