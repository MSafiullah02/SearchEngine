The virus has caused an outbreak of viral pneumonia, which has been named Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As of 24:00 on 6 February 2020, over 31,000 cases and 636 deaths had been confirmed in China [1]. Furthermore, more than 1,770,000 cases had been diagnosed in 213 countries, areas or territories as at 13 April 2020 [2]. On 23 January 2020, Chinese authorities imposed a lockdown of Wuhan [3]. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [4] and on 11 March 2020, a pandemic [5].",

The methodology continues to be developed, and a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRSIMA) extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-SCR) including reporting guidance was published in 2018 [16]. Given the urgency of the COVID-19 epidemic and the need to understand and access information about it, a scoping review was considered suitable for the situation. We therefore conducted this scoping review to help identify research gaps related to this new viral disease and propose recommendations for future research on COVID-19.",

The basic research could be divided broadly into two categories: 21 genetic studies and 12 molecular biology studies. Ten genetic studies traced the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the possible virus reservoir. Among these, most suggested that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a bat-CoV, namely bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-CoV-RaTG13 as potential candidates [18-26]. However, Ji et al. [18] found snakes to be the most probable reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 while Guo et al. [26] suggested mink could be a candidate reservoir. Of the molecular studies, five [27-31] showed that the key receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is highly expressed in lung type II alveolar cells (AT2) [27], positive cholangiocytes [29], upper oesophagus, stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon [30]. The other studies included an assessment of the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [32], and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases [33,34].",

According to the nine articles [35-43], R0 ranges between 2.2 and 3.9. Some studies showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to [37,44] or even higher [39] than SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

After the outbreak of COVID-19, the WHO, US CDC and ECDC released guidance/guidelines as soon as possible, as did several Chinese institutions. However, most of these documents did not establish formal guideline development groups, and they did not fulfil the strict principles of evidence-based practice. For example, most guidance/guidelines did not grade the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, and thus owed to the emerging crisis, such guidance/guidelines need to be considered with these limitations in mind. In 2007, the WHO published guidance about the process of developing rapid advice guidelines [129], stating that when a public health emergency occurs, a rapid review is needed and the development time should not exceed 6 months [135]. However, considering the limited time to set up panels, this could be a challenge for guidance/guideline developers.

For example, in the current situation, a systematic review to estimate the incubation period or research on new drugs or treatments, would be of great importance. This scoping review has several strengths. We performed a systematic search of a comprehensive set of sources, including databases, preprint servers, and official websites of international organisations and associations at the early stage of the pandemic. Furthermore, our large sample size is sufficient to illustrate the state of research and identify research gaps related to COVID-19 at the onset of the pandemic.",

            "text": "This study also has some limitations. Because of the delay in indexing, some articles published as at 6 February 2020 may not have been identified. Also, because our retrieval time was only until this date, articles published or posted after this date, of which there have been many, have not been included in the analysis. As some preprints, guidance/guidelines and disease control plans are constantly updated, the publication date we extracted may not be the time of their first publication time. Also, we did not assess the quality of the included literature because of diversity of the types of included articles. Another limitation of our study was that it only included articles published in English and Chinese, which could introduce publication bias. However, as the epidemic was most heavily affecting China until early February, it is reasonable to expect that literature published in English and Chinese up until this point in time covered the majority of the available knowledge. Finally, we were unable to access the full texts of two articles despite contacting the authors. However, compared with the total number of articles included in the review, we anticipate that the exclusion of these two articles is unlikely to have a major impact.",

More clinical research is needed, but in the rapidly evolving global pandemic, we encourage researchers to continuously review the latest literature, to take into account the latest available evidence and avoid overlapping work, and to improve evidence for the development of clinical practice guidelines and public health policies.",
