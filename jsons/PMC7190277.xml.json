These include the provision of clean water and air, pollination of crops, and medicinal products. The 2019 Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services report showed that about 1 million species face extinction without rapid interventions to tackle the drivers of biodiversity loss, such as land use and climate change.6 The covid-19 pandemic reminds us that many emerging diseases arise from complex interactions between humans, wildlife, and domestic animals, resulting from changes in land use or food systems.7 Marine and terrestrial ecosystems also sequester carbon from the atmosphere and therefore have a vital role in climate mitigation efforts.8\n",

In recent months, several research papers submitted in response to the call have appeared in The BMJ and have discussed the effects on health of predominantly anthropogenic pollutants\u2014including ozone and fine particulate air pollution.12\n13\n14 We are now fully launching the series by publishing several more articles that emphasise potential ways to reduce the environmental footprint of society and improve public health (https://www.bmj.com/anthropocene), with more to follow in the next few months. These will include papers on decarbonising the NHS; capitalising on the health (co)benefits of \u201clow carbon\u201d policies in sectors such as energy, housing, transport, and food systems; and the health dividend that could be achieved through more sustainable cities.",
