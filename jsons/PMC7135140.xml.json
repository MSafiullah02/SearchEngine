First known as Korean hemorrhagic fever, now it is commonly referred to as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) [36]. Apodemus agrarius (the field mouse) was found to be the reservoir. The virus, first isolated in 1978, was designated the Hantaan virus after the Hantaan River (Korea) where many of the original cases were described. Rattus norvegicus and R rattus were the hosts of Seoul virus, the cause of urban HFRS [5], [36]. In Scandinavia, nephropathia epidemica, a renal disease with mild or without hemorrhagic manifestations, was caused by Puumala virus spread from Clethrionomys glareolus, the bank vole. The only insectivore to harbor a hantavirus is the Suncus murinus, the Indian tree shrew. Prospect Hill virus was the first hantavirus causing human disease to be described in the Americas (Microtus pennsylvanicus [meadow vole] host). Severe HFRS of the Balkans was caused by Dobrava virus associated with Apodemus flavicollis. At least three subfamilies and 28 species of hantaviruses cause either HFRS or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) [5], [36], [48].",

As with other hemorrhagic fever viruses, the mosquito introduces the virus into the skin where it replicates locally and then spreads into the regional lymph nodes. The virus then disseminates by the bloodstream to the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and myocardium. The hallmark of the disease is steatosis, apoptosis, and necrosis mainly in the midzonal region of the liver [77]. Kupffer cells are infected followed by hepatocytes in the midzone of the liver. Midzonal necrosis develops. The appearance of Councilman's bodies is indicative of hepatocyte apoptosis with minimum mononuclear infiltrates [78]. There is a predominance of apoptosis over necrosis with contributions from a variety of activated lymphocytes and various cytokines, notably transforming growth factor-\u03b2 [77].",

Another recommended intravenous regimen is an initial dose of 30 mg/kg followed by 15 mg/kg every 6 hours for 4 days, followed by 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours for 6 days. Oral ribavirin doses are, 2 g loading dose followed by 4 g/d in four divided doses for 4 days followed by 2 g/d for six doses. Oral ribavirin is believed to be only half as effective as intravenous therapy. Intravenous ribavirin, if given within 6 days of the beginning of symptoms, reduces mortality by 90% [89]. Postexposure prophylaxis with ribavirin is recommended by some but not all authorities. This consists of 2 g orally in four divided doses for 7 days [14], [16], [17], [78], [84], [95]. Zidampidine, a derivative of zidovudine, is a new agent that seems effective in treating the CD-1 mouse model of Lassa VHF [96].",

A new flavivirus, a close relative to the tick-borne Kyasanur forest disease virus, was the same virus isolated in 1995 from six patients with dengue-like hemorrhagic fever from the Alkhumra district, south of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [164], [165], [166], [167]. Further investigation found two additional cases in 1994, both in butchers and both organisms recovered from wounds [166]. Sources of infection identified in the original cases included contaminated wounds (butchers, six); tick bites (student and engineer, two); and consumption of raw camel milk (soldier, driver, and poultry worker, three) [166]. The investigation identified 37 patients (20 laboratory confirmed). All presented with an acute febrile flu-like illness and hepatitis; half displayed hemorrhagic findings (55%); and 20% had encephalitis. It was concluded that the disease was transmitted by mosquito bite or direct contact with infected sheep, goats, and rodents. How the virus is maintained in nature is under investigation. Of 11 cases identified between 1994 and 1999, four died [166]. Overall, there was 25% mortality with this outbreak [164], [165].",
