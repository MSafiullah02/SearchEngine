Cervical spine injuries can also be pronounced, as in patients with head trauma. In fact, spinal cord injury may be present without any radiographic abnormalities of the spine. Finally, vital signs will vary based on the pediatric patient's age. This may be a pitfall during rapid evaluation by any nurse or HCP not accustomed to the care of children. Younger pediatric patients have higher metabolic rates and, therefore, higher respiratory rates and heart rates. This can be a distinct disadvantage versus older pediatric patients when encountering similar diseases. An example is inhaled toxins (e.g., nerve agents and lung-damaging agents). Infants and children will suffer greater toxicity since they inhale at a faster rate due to higher metabolic demands and thus, distribute the toxin more rapidly to various end-organs.",

The most common etiology for cardiorespiratory arrest in children is respiratory pathology, typically of the upper airway. Most of the airway resistance in children occurs in the upper airway. Nasal obstruction can lead to severe respiratory distress due to infants being obligate nose breathers. Their relatively large tongue and small mouth can lead to airway obstruction quickly, especially when the neuromuscular tone is abnormal such as during sedation or encephalopathy. In infants, physiologic (i.e., copious secretions) and pathologic (i.e., edema, vomitus, blood, and foreign body) factors will exaggerate this obstruction. Securing the airway in such events can be quite challenging. Typically, the glottis is located more anterior and cephalad. Appropriate visualization during laryngoscopy can be further hampered by the prominent occiput that causes neck flexion and, therefore, reduces the alignment of visual axes. The omega or horseshoeshaped epiglottis in young infants and children is quite susceptible to inflammation and swelling. As in epiglottitis, the glottis becomes strangulated in a circumferential manner leading to dangerous supraglottic obstruction. Children also have a natural tendency to laryngospasm and bronchospasm. Finally, due to weaker cartilage in infants, dynamic airway collapse can occur especially in states of increased resistance and high expiratory flow. Along with altered pulmonary compensation and compliance, a child may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and possibly arrest.",

With tachycardia and elevated systemic vascular resistance, younger pediatric patients can maintain normal blood pressure despite decreased cardiac output and poor perfusion (compensated shock). Since children have less blood and volume reserve, they progress to this state quickly. In pediatric patients with multiorgan injury or severe gastrointestinal losses, these compensatory mechanisms are pushed to their limits. The unaccustomed HCP may be lulled into complacency since the blood pressure is normal. All the while, the pediatric patient's organs are being poorly perfused. Once these compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, the patient rapidly progresses to hypotension and, therefore, hypotensive shock. If not reversed expeditiously, this may lead to irreversible shock, ischemia, multiorgan dysfunction, and death.",

For example, younger pediatric patients can present with nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) instead of generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE). In fact, NCSE is more common among younger pediatric patients than GCSE, especially in those from 1 to 12 months of age. Furthermore, many of them are previously well without preexisting diseases such as epilepsy. Other disease states may include poisoning, inborn errors of metabolism, meningitis, and other etiologies of encephalopathy. Using the modified pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the cornerstone when evaluating the young pediatric patient when they are preverbal.

Whether considered accidental (motor vehicle crash) or nonaccidental (abusive head trauma), evaluation of the neurological status of the acutely injured pediatric patient can be problematic, especially the GCS. Some prefer to use the AVPU system (Alert, Responds to Verbal, Responds to Pain, and Unresponsive). Due to the disproportionately larger head and weaker neck muscles, there is more risk of acceleration-deceleration injuries (fall from a significant height, vehicular ejection, and abusive head trauma). Furthermore, the softer skull, dural structural differences, and vessel supply will place the pediatric patient at risk for brain injury and intracranial hemorrhage. Finally, due to pediatric brain composition, the risk of diffuse axonal injury and cerebral edema is much higher.",

In pediatric patients less than 9 years of age, the most commonly seen injuries are in the atlas, axis, and upper cervical vertebrae. In young pediatric patients, spinal injuries tend to be anatomically higher (cervical) versus adolescents (thoracolumbar). Furthermore, congenital abnormalities, such as atlantoaxial abnormalities (Trisomy 21), may exaggerate the process. The clinical presentation of spinal cord injury varies in young pediatric patients due to ongoing development. Laxity of ligaments, wedge-shaped vertebrae, and incomplete ossification centers contribute to specific patterns of injuries. Finally, Spinal Cord Injury without Radiographic Abnormality (SCIWORA) may result. Because of the disproportionately larger head, weaker neck muscles, and elasticity of the spine, significant distraction and flexion injury of the spinal cord may occur without apparent ligament or bony disruption (Hilmas et al. 2008; Jacobson and Severin 2012; Severin 2011).

            "text": "Motor skills develop from birth. Gross and fine motor milestones are achieved in a predictable manner and must be assessed during each HCP encounter. Cognitive development will follow a similar pattern of maturation. The development of these skills can often predict injuries and their extent. For example, consider a house fire. A young infant, preschooler, and adolescent are sleeping upstairs in house when a fire breaks out in the middle of the night. The smoke detectors begin to alarm. Each child is awoken by the ensuing noise and chaos. Based on the development, the adolescent will most likely make it out of the house alive. He will comprehend the threat, run down the stairs, and exit the house without delay. Smoke inhalation may be minimal. If it is a middle adolescent, an attempt may be made to jump out of the window leading to multiple blunt trauma with or without traumatic brain injury. The preschooler most likely will be too scared and not understand how to escape. Tragically, he may hide under a bed or in a closet. When the firefighters arrive and search the house, the preschooler may remain silent because of fear, especially of strangers in the house. He will most likely succumb to thermal injuries along with the effects of carbon monoxide and die. As far as the infant, he cannot walk, climb, crawl, or run. Furthermore, he cannot scream for help or know how to escape. As the smoke engulfs the room, he will most likely suffer severe smoke inhalation injury including extensive carbon monoxide toxicity along with thermal injuries and die. This example also points out another important difference in pediatric patients: their dependence on caregivers. When considering neonates, for example, their entire existence depends on the caregiver, including feeding, changing of diapers, nurturing, and environmental safety. These dynamics are essential to the pediatric patient's health and survival, especially during a disaster.",

One of the biggest challenges in pediatrics is the lack of the patient's ability to verbally convey complaints. As described above, verbal milestones vary among the different age ranges of the pediatric patient. HCPs are often faced with a caregiver's subjective assessment of the problem. Although it can be revealing and informative, this may not be available in an acute crisis situation. It will take the astute HCP to determine, for example, if an inconsolably crying infant is in pain from a corneal abrasion or something more life-threatening such as meningitis. This can also be a challenging task in a teenager, especially during middle adolescence. An HCP will have to determine, for example, if the seemingly lethargic middle adolescent is intoxicated with illicit drugs or has diabetic ketoacidosis.",

Such a situation leads to disruption in the normal pattern of life, resulting in misfortune, helplessness, and suffering, with adverse effects on the socioeconomic structure of a region or a country and/or modifications of the environment to such an extent that there is a need for assistance and immediate outside intervention\" (Lynch and Berman 2009 ). Types of disasters usually fall into two broad categories: natural and man-made. Natural disasters are generally associated with weather and geological events, including extremes of temperature, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and drought. Naturally occurring epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1, 2014 Ebola, and 2019 novel coronavirus outbreaks, are often included in this category. Man-made disasters are usually associated with a criminal attack such as an active shooter incident, or a terrorist attack using weapons such as explosive, biological, or chemical agents. However, man-made disasters can also refer to human-based technological incidents, such as a building or bridge collapse, or events related to the manufacture, transportation, storage, and use of hazardous materials, such as the 1986 Chernobyl radiation leak and the 1984 Bhopal toxic gas leak. Even though disasters can be primarily placed into any of these two categories, they can often impact each other and compound the magnitude of any disaster incident (United States Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General 2009). A prime example is the March 2011 Tohoku earthquake leading to a tsunami (natural) that triggered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (man-made).",

Employees, physical plant, workflow and operations of the clinic, hospital, or system can be disrupted. External disasters are those incidents that occur outside of the health care facility or system. This impacts the community surrounding the facility, proximally or distally, but does not directly threaten the facility or its employees. As with natural and man-made disasters, internal and external disasters can impact each other. For example, an overflow of patients during a high census period may lead to the shutdown of the hospital to any new patients (internal disaster). This will place the hospital on bypass and possibly stress other hospitals in the community beyond their means (external disaster). A terrorist event, such as the release of sarin in a subway system during a busy morning commute, can lead to massive disruption in the community (external disaster). All the victims of the attack will seek medical care at nearby hospitals, possibly overwhelming the health care staff and depleting critical resources (internal disaster). Characterization of disasters by geography (local, state, national, and international) can also be used. Again, no matter the site of the incident, a disaster in one area could easily create a disaster in another geographical region. For example, a factory and its community could be ravaged by a hurricane (local disaster). If this is the only factory in the world to produce a certain medication, this could lead to critical shortages to hospitals all around the world (international disaster).",

            "text": "The term \"disaster preparedness\" has been used over the years as a way to describe efforts to manage any disaster event. However, preparedness is only one aspect of the process. The use of the term disaster planning is more appropriate. It considers all aspects needed for an effective effort and is dependent on additional phases, not just preparedness. National preparedness efforts, including planning, are now informed by the Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 8 that was signed by the president in March 2011 and describes the nation's approach to preparedness (United States Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Safe and Healthy Students 2013; United States Department of Homeland Security 2018b). A recommended method for disaster preparedness efforts is the utilization of an \"all-hazards\" model of emergency management (Adini et al. 2012; Waugh 2000) . The four overlapping phases of the model include mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. The mitigation phase involves \"activities designed to prevent or reduce losses from a disaster\" (Waugh 2000) . Examples include land use planning in flood plains, structural integrity measures in earthquake zones, and deployment of security cameras. The preparedness phase includes the \"planning of how to respond in an emergency or a disaster, and developing capabilities for more effective response\" (Waugh 2000) . Examples include training programs for emergency responders, drills and exercises, early warning systems, contingency planning, and development of equipment and supply caches. Up to this point, all planning efforts are proactive and not reactive. Often times, a hazard analysis is conducted to delineate areas of strengths and identify potential risks. It helps in \"the identification of hazards, assessment of the probability of a disaster, and the probable intensity and location; assessment of its potential impact on a community; the property, persons, and geographic areas that may be at risk; and the determination of agency priorities based on the probability level of a disaster and the potential losses\" (Waugh 2000) . After a disaster or emergency incident occurs, the response phase, or \"immediate reaction to a disaster\", (Waugh 2000) begins. Examples include mass evacuations, sandbagging buildings and other structures, providing emergency medical services, firefighting, and restoration of public order. In some situations, the response period may be a short (e.g., house fire), intermediate (e.g., bomb detonation), or extended (e.g., pandemic influenza) duration. After a period of time, the recovery phase follows. These are \"activities that continue beyond the emergency period to restore lifelines\" (Waugh 2000) . Examples include the provision of temporary shelter, restoration of utilities such as power, critical stress debriefing for responders, and victims, job assistance and small business loans, and debris clearance. Recovery always seems to be the most unpredictable; it may take days to months to years. As demonstrated with recent hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017, the most affected regions are still in the phase of recovery and may be along a prolonged track as Hurricane Katrina in 2005. As mentioned, the early phases of planning (mitigation and preparedness) truly hinge upon the environment or community surrounding the health care site (e.g., clinic, hospital, or long-term care facility). Identification of potential hazards and risks is a key step in disaster planning. Using a Hazard Vulnerability Assessment (HVA) or a Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) can provide a basis for mitigation and prevention tasks. An HVA/THIRA emphasizes which types of natural or man-made disasters are likely to occur in a community (e.g., tornado, flood, chemical release, or terrorist event). They further highlight the impact those disasters may have on the community and any capabilities that are in place that may lessen the effects of the disaster (Illinois Emergency Medical Services for Children 2018).",

            "text": "A basic principle of the HVA methodology is to determine the risk of such an event or attack occurring at a given hospital or hospital system. Simply, the risk is a product of the probability of an event and the severity of such an event if it occurs (risk = probability \u00d7 severity). However, there are many complexities in quantifying terrorism risk (Waugh 2005; Woo 2002) . It is important to note that in some circumstances, exposure may need to be included in the equation (risk = probability \u00d7 severity \u00d7 exposure), but usually for operational risk management applications (Mitchell and Decker 2004) . At any rate, issues to consider for the probability of an event occurring include, but are not limited to, geographic location and topography, proximity to hazards, degree of accessibility, known risks, historical data, and statistics of various manufacturer/vendor products. Severity, on the other hand, is dependent on the gap between the magnitude of an event and mitigation for the given event (severity = magnitude -mitigation). Magnitude varies upon the impact of the event to humans, property, and/or business. Mitigation varies upon the development of internal and external readiness before a disaster strikes. As one can surmise, if the magnitude of the event outstrips the mitigation, the event is considered a threatening hazard. Once the HVA is completed, the health care site should immediately prioritize planning efforts for the top 5-10 hazards and develop plans accordingly. All other identified hazards must also be addressed to ensure a broad and robust disaster plan. It is important to realize that local and regional entities also perform comprehensive HVAs. A concerted analysis among a hospital and key community stakeholders is optimal for a coordinated plan.",

Typically, these tools do not have components specific to children or other at-risk populations. However, the tools can be adapted either directly by adding children to specific hazards or ensuring considerations specific to children are incorporated into the HVA/THIRA calculations. The HVA/THIRA should be reviewed and updated minimally on an annual basis to identify changing or external circumstances. This includes conducting a pediatric-specific disaster risk assessment to identify where children congregate and their risks (e.g., schools, popular field trip designations, summer camps, houses of worship, and juvenile justice facilities) (Illinois Emergency Medical Services for Children 2018).",

            "text": "Of note, HVA techniques have been utilized for pediatric-specific disaster plans. Having a separate pediatric HVA (PHVA) is crucial to a well-rounded and robust health care disaster plan. First, it demonstrates the extent of the pediatric population in the community. It is estimated that 25% of the population fits within the age range of pediatric patients. In some situations, it may be more. During the performance of a PHVA, it was demonstrated that 29% of the community was less than 19 years of age (Jacobson and Severin 2012) . Second, a PHVA increases the situational awareness of those tasked to plan for disasters that involve children and adolescents. Often times, children and adolescents are excluded from local and regional disaster plans. The unique vulnerabilities of pediatric patients will demand appropriate drills, exercises, equipment, medications, and expertise. Thirdly, identifying pediatric risks in a community will help prioritize efforts of planning, especially in those hospitals not accustomed to caring for pediatric patients. Finally, a PHVA helps to develop a framework for global pediatric disaster planning. This can extend beyond a local community and actually advance city, state, regional, and national disaster planning efforts. There has been a development of web-based tools to simplify and enhance the PHVA process (Jacobson and Severin 2012) .",

It will become more of an issue if the health care facility is not accustomed to caring for acutely ill pediatric patients. This will be further exacerbated by a massive surge of acutely ill pediatric patients, a widespread or prolonged disaster, and supply line disruptions. To protect the health security of children and families during a public health emergency, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) manages and maintains the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), a cache of medical countermeasures for rapid deployment and use in response to a public health emergency or disaster (Fagbuyi et al. 2016) . Various pediatric-specific supplies and countermeasures are included in the SNS. Maintaining a supply of medications and medical supplies for specific health threats allows the stockpile to respond with the right product when a specific disease or agent is known. If a community experiences a large-scale public health incident in which the disease or agent is unknown, the first line of support from the stockpile is to send a broad-range of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.

Evaluation of the pediatric patient should include a primary survey (ABCDE), secondary survey (focused SAMPLE history and focused physical examination), and diagnostic assessments (laboratory, radiological, and other advanced tests). This will guide further therapeutic interventions. Particular attention should be given to the identification of respiratory and/or circulatory derangements of the child, including airway obstruction, respiratory failure, shock, and cardiopulmonary failure. Interventions will be based on physiologic derangements of the pediatric patient and determined by the scope of practice and protocols, such as standard resuscitation algorithms for neonatal (American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association et al. 2016) and pediatric (American Heart Association 2016) victims.",

Geophysical disasters originate from the solid earth and include earthquake (ground movement and tsunami), dry mass movement (rock fall and landslides), and volcanic activity (ash fall, lahar, pyroclastic flow, and lava flow). Lahar is a hot or cold mixture of earthen material flowing on the slope of a volcano either during or between volcanic eruptions. Meteorological disasters are caused by short-lived, micro-to meso-scale extreme weather and atmospheric conditions that last from minutes to days and include extreme temperatures (cold wave, heat wave, and severe winter conditions such as snow/ice or frost/ freeze), fog, and storms. Storms can be extra-tropical, tropical, or convective. Convective storms include derecho, hail, lightning/thunderstorm, rain, tornado, sand/dust storm, winter storm/blizzard, storm/surge, and wind. Derecho is a widespread and usually fast-moving windstorm associated with convection/convective storm and includes downburst and straight-line winds. Hydrological disasters are caused by the occurrence, movement, and distribution of surface/subsurface freshwater and saltwater and include floods, landslides (an avalanche of snow, debris, mudflow, and rockfall), and wave action (rogue wave and seiche). Flood types can be coastal, riverine, flash, or ice jam. Climatological disasters are caused by longlived, meso-to macro-scale atmospheric processes ranging from intraseasonal to multidecadal climate variability and include drought, glacial lake outburst, and wildfire (forest fire, land fire: brush, bush, or pasture). Biological disasters are caused by the exposure to living organisms and their toxic substances or vectorborne diseases that they may carry and include epidemics (viral, bacterial, parasitic, fungal, and prion), insect infestation (grasshopper and locust), and animal accidents. Extraterrestrial disasters are caused by asteroids, meteoroids, and comets as they pass near-earth, enter Earth's atmosphere, and/or strike the earth, and by changes in the interplanetary conditions that affect the Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere. Types include impact (airbursts) and space weather (energetic particles, geomagnetic storm, and shockwave) events (CRED 2019).",

Although the majority of fatalities were due to geophysical events, mostly earthquakes and tsunamis, 91% of all disasters was caused by floods, storms, droughts, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events. The financial impact was staggering. In 1998-2017, disaster-hit countries reported direct economic losses valued at US$ 2908 billion, of which climate-related disasters caused US$ 2245 billion or 77% of the total. This was up from 68% (US$ 895 billion) of losses (US$ 1313 billion) reported between 1978 and 1997. Overall, reported losses from extreme weather events rose by 151% between these two 20-year periods. In absolute monetary terms, over the last 20-years, the USA recorded the biggest losses (US$ 945 billion), reflecting high asset values as well as frequent events. China, by comparison, suffered a significantly higher number of disasters than the USA (577 vs. 482) but lower total losses (US$ 492 billion) (CRED 2018) (Figs. 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9 In 2018, 281 climate-related and geophysical incidents in the world were estimated with 10,733 deaths and over 60 million people impacted. Indonesia recorded approximately half of the deaths with India accounting for half of those impacted by disasters. Notable features of 2018 were intense seismic activity in Indonesia, a series of disasters in Japan, floods in India, and an eventful year for both volcanic activity and wildfires. However, an ongoing trend of lower death tolls from previous years continued into 2018 (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) and United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) 2019) (Tables 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10 and 5.11 There are no specific deviations when medically managing children after a natural disaster. According to Sirbaugh and DiRocco (2012) \"Small-scale mass casualty incidents occur daily in the United States. Few present unusual challenges to the local medical systems other than in the number of patients that must be treated at one time. Except in earthquakes, explosions, building collapses, and some types of terrorist attacks, the same holds true for large-scale disasters. Sudden violent disaster mechanisms can produce major trauma cases, including patients needing field amputations or management of crush syndrome. For the most part, medicine after a disaster is much the same as it was before the disaster, with more minor injuries, more people with exacerbations of their chronic illnesses, and number of patients seeking what is ordinarily considered primary care. This is true for children and adults.\" It should be noted, however, that children have a predisposition to illness and injury after natural disasters. The HCP must be able to identify any health problems and treat the child effectively and efficiently while utilizing standard resuscitation protocols as indicated.",

Children are at increased risk for injury since adults are distracted by recovery efforts and may not be able to supervise them closely. The environment may not be safe due to environmental hazards, such as collapsed buildings, sinkholes, and high water levels. Dangerous equipment used during relief efforts may be present, such as heavy earth moving equipment, chainsaws, and power generators. Hazardous chemicals, such as gasoline and other volatile hydrocarbons, may be readily accessible or taint the environment. Without suitable shelter, children are also exposed to weather, animals, and insects (Sirbaugh and DiRocco 2012) .",

            "text": "Infectious diseases may also pose a problem to children after a natural disaster. Infectious patterns will persist during a disaster based on the season and time of year. There may be outbreaks or epidemics of highly contagious infections (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pyogenes) due to mass sheltering of children and families. Poor nutrition or decreased availability of food may lower their resistance against infections. Various water-borne or food-borne diseases may cause illnesses in children. Poor hygiene and mass shelter environments may exacerbate these illnesses. Immunized children should be protected against common preventable diseases after a natural disaster but still could be a problem in mass groups that are not completely or appropriately immunized. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, there were increased cases of diarrhea, cholera, measles, and tetanus in children months after the earthquake despite some level of vaccination (Sirbaugh and DiRocco 2012) . Children are at risk for various environmental emergencies. Austere environments will impact children greatly. Heat exposure coupled with minimal access to drinkable water may lead to severe dehydration. Exposure to the cold may lead to frostbite or hypothermia. Children are at risk for carbon monoxide toxicity due to generator use or natural gas poisoning due to disrupted gas lines. There is always a risk for thermal injury due to the use of candles and other flame sources. Exposure to animals (snakes) and insects (spiders) may increase the risk of envenomation. Submersion injury and drowning incidents may escalate. This will be due to lack of supervision of children around storm drains, newly formed bodies of water, or rushing waters of storm diversion systems (Sirbaugh and DiRocco 2012) . Mental health issues are often seen in children after natural disasters. Even though a child may not be injured, they may become \"psychiatric casualties\" due to the horrific sights they have seen during or after the disaster. Children and adolescents with behavioral or psychiatric problems may experience worsening symptoms and signs due to stress, trauma, disruption of routines, or availability of medications. This is often exacerbated if the parent, guardian, caregiver, or HCP is also having difficulty coping with the stress of the disaster. In general, the most common mental health problem in children is a post-traumatic stress disorder. However, separation anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and severe stranger anxiety can also be seen in children after a traumatic event (Sirbaugh and DiRocco 2012) . See Chap. 12 for more detailed information.",

Since then, other incidents, both foreign and domestic, have involved children and complicates the concept of and the response to terrorism. Johnston (2017) said it best in his review of Terrorist and Criminal Attacks Targeting Children: \"One of the more accepted defining characteristics of terrorism is that it targets noncombatants including men, women, and children. However, terrorist attacks specifically targeting children over other noncombatants are uncommon. This is for the same reason that most terrorists have historically avoided mass casualty terrorism: the shock value is so great that such attacks erode support for the terrorists' political objectives. The 9/11 attacks represent an increasing trend in mass casualty terrorism. At the same time, policymakers are examining this evolving threat, they must increasingly consider the threat of terrorist attacks targeting children.\" Based on historical events, it is clear infants, toddlers, children, and adolescents have been victims of terrorism. This global trend of terrorists targeting children seems to be escalating (Johnston 2017) . Therefore, it is imperative to understand terrorism and ways it impacts the children and families served by the health care community. Combs (2018) defines terrorism as \"an act of violence perpetrated on innocent civilian noncombatants in order to evoke fear in an audience\". However, she goes on to argue that to become an operational definition, there must also be the addition of a \"political purpose\" of the violent act. Therefore, \"terrorism, then, is an act composed of at least four crucial elements: 1) it is an act of violence, 2) it has a political motive or goal, 3) it is perpetrated against civilian noncombatants, and 4) it is staged to be played before an audience whose reaction of fear and terror is the desired result.\" (Combs 2018) .",

            "text": "There are different typologies of terrorism. At least five types of terror violence have been suggested by Feliks Gross: \"Mass terror is terror by a state, where the regime coerces the opposition in the population, whether organized or unorganized, sometimes in an institutionalized manner. Dynastic assassination is an attack on a head of state or a ruling elite. Random terror involves the placing of explosives where people gather (such as post offices, railroads, and cafes) to destroy whoever happens to be there. Focused random terror restricts the placing of explosives, for example to where significant agents of oppression are likely to gather. Finally, tactical terror is directed solely against the ruling government as a part of a 'broad revolutionary strategic plan'\" (Combs 2018 ). An additional typology offered is \"lone wolf terror which involves someone who commits violent acts in support of some group, movement, or ideology, but who does stand alone, outside of any command structure and without material assistance from any group\" (Combs 2018) . Martin (2017) reviews eight different terrorism typologies in the ever shifting, multifaceted world of modern terrorism. The New Terrorism \"is characterized by the threat of mass casualty attacks from dissident terrorist organizations, new and creative configurations, transnational religious solidarity, and redefined moral justifications for political violence\" (Martin 2017) . State Terrorism is \"committed by governments against perceived enemies and can be directed externally against adversaries in the international domain or internally against domestic enemies\" (Martin 2017) . Dissident Terrorism is \"committed by nonstate movements and groups against governments, ethno-national groups, religious groups, and other perceived enemies\" (Martin 2017) . Religious Terrorism is \"motivated by an absolute belief that an otherworldly power has sanctioned and commanded the application of terrorist violence for the greater glory of the faith\u2026[it] is usually conducted in defense of what believers consider to be the one true faith\" (Martin 2017) . Ideological Terrorism is \"motivated by political systems of belief (ideologies), which champion the self-perceived inherent rights of a particular group or interest in opposition to another group or interest. The system of belief incorporates theoretical and philosophical justifications for violently asserting the rights of the championed group or interest\" (Martin 2017) . International Terrorism \"spills over onto the world's stage. Targets are selected because of their value as symbols of international interests, either within the home country or across state boundaries\" (Martin 2017) . Criminal Dissident Terrorism \"is solely profit-driven, and can be some combination of profit and politics. For instance, traditional organized criminals accrue profits to fund their criminal activity and for personal interests, while criminalpolitical enterprises acquire profits to sustain their movement\" (Martin 2017) . Gender-Selective Terrorism \"is directed against an enemy population's men or women because of their gender. Systematic violence is directed against men because of the perceived threat posed by males as potential soldiers or sources of opposition. Systematic violence is directed against women to destroy an enemy group's cultural identity or terrorize the group into submission\" (Martin 2017) .",

Nerve agents are volatile chemicals and can be released in liquid or vapor form. However, the liquid form can become vapor depending upon its level of volatility (e.g, G-agents are more volatile than VX). The level of toxicity depends on the agent, concentration of the agent, physical form, route and length of exposure, and environmental factors (temperature and wind) (Tables 5.16 and 5.17).",

Atropine is a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine muscarinic receptors and reverses peripheral muscarinic symptoms. It does not restore function at the neuromuscular junction nicotinic receptors. It does, however, treat early phases of convulsions. Pralidoxime chloride separates the nerve agent from acetylcholinesterase and restores enzymatic function. It also binds free nerve agent. The major goal is to prevent \"aging\" of the enzyme (e.g., GD). Diazepam provides treatment of nerve agent-induced seizures and prevents secondary neurologic injury. Typically, associated seizures are refractory to other antiepileptic drugs. The antiseizure effect of diazepam is enhanced by atropine (Banks 2014; Cieslak and Henretig 2016; Messele et al. 2018) .

The intermediate syndrome has not been reported in humans after nerve agent exposure, nor has it been produced in animals. Muscular necrosis has occurred in animals after high-dose nerve agent exposure but reversed within weeks; it has not been reported in humans (Banks 2014).",

They were brought to a nearby hospital and treated for signs consistent with a cholinergic crisis due to a nerve agent exposure. Analysis of the Skripals found the presence of a secret nerve agent called Novichok. Further testing found high concentrations of the agent on the front-door handle of his home. One of the investigating police officers, Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, unknowingly touched the door-handle and also became ill. All three survived due to rapid recognition of the nerve agent exposure by hospital personnel. Four months later, two other people, Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, became ill with identical symptoms in the town of Amesbury, 7 miles from Salisbury. They were later confirmed to have high concentrations of Novichok on their hands from a perfume bottle found in a recycling bin. Both were immediately treated, but Dawn Sturgess later died. Charlie Rowley survived. It was believed the discarded perfume bottle contained Novichok and was discarded by the assailants after the attempt on Sergei Skripal. On September 5, 2018, the UK government revealed that their investigation uncovered two suspects from closed circuit television (CCTV) footage near the Skripal's home. The suspects entered the UK on Russian passports using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, stayed in a London hotel for 2 days, visited Salisbury briefly, and then returned to Moscow. Minute traces of Novichok were also found in the London hotel where they had stayed. The UK Prime Minister, Teresa May, said that the suspects are thought to be officers from Russia's military intelligence service the Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye (GRU), and that this showed that the poisoning was \"not a rogue operation\" and was \"almost certainly\" approved at a senior level of the Russian state. The two suspects later appeared on Russian TV denying the accusations and saying they were just \"tourists\" who had traveled all the way from Moscow to Salisbury just to see the \"famous cathedral\". However, CCTV of the cathedral area found no evidence of the two men visiting the cathedral, although they were captured on CCTV near the Skripal's home. In a development in September 2018, one of the men was revealed as actually being a Russian intelligence officer named Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga and was a decorated veteran of Russian campaigns in Chechnya and Ukraine. And later in October, the second man was named as Dr. Alexander Mishkin, a naval medical doctor allegedly recruited by the GRU (Chai et al. 2018; May 2018) .",

Almost everything known about these agents is due to a Russian defector, Vil Mirzayanov (2009) who was an analytical chemist at the Russian State Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology (GosNIIOKhT). He has described the details of the Novichok program in his book \"State Secrets: An Insider's Chronicle of the Russian Chemical Weapons Program\". The first three nerve agents of the Novichok series developed in the program were Substance-33, A-230, and A-232 (Table 5 .18). They were synthesized as unitary agents, like VX, tabun, soman, and sarin. Unitary means that the chemical structure was produced at its maximum potency. However, the Novichok agents were developed as binary agents: maximum potency when two inert substances are combined together prior to deployment to create the active nerve agent (Cieslak and Henretig 2003) . Very little is known about the chemistry of these weaponized organophosphate agents. However, they appear to be more potent than current nerve agents. For example, the LD 50 of Novichok agents is reported 0.22 \u03bcg/kg similar to 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl N,N-dimethylphosphoramidofluoridate (VG), a novel fourth generation nerve agent. Furthermore, Novichok-5 is 8\u00d7 more effective than VX and Novichock-7 is 10\u00d7 more effective than soman (Cieslak and Henretig 2003; Hoenig 2007) .",

There appears to be a similar \"aging\" process as seen with other nerve agents. In addition, the Novichok agents binding to peripheral sensory nerves distinguishes this class of organophosphates. Prolonged or high-dose exposure results in debilitating peripheral neuropathy. Exposure to these agents is fatal unless aggressively managed (Cieslak and Henretig 2003) . Decontamination is essential to prevent ongoing exposure to the patient and medical personnel. Clothing should be removed and quickly placed in a sealed bag (prevents ongoing exposure to the emission of vapors) followed by thorough washing with soap and water. Application of dry bleach powder should be avoided as it may hydrolyze nerve agents into toxic metabolites that can produce ongoing cholinergic effects. Supportive care is essential. Antidote therapy should be given as usual for nerve agents, including atropine, diazepam, and pralidoxime chloride (United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, National Library of Medicine 2019; United States Department of Health and Human Services, Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management (CHEMM) 2019). Of note, the toxicity of the Novichok agents may not rely on anticholinesterase inhibition. Some have suggested that reactive oximes like potassium 2,3-butanedione monoximate are preferred oximes for antidotal therapy (Cieslak and Henretig 2003) .",

            "text": "Cyanide is a naturally occurring chemical. It can be found in plants and seeds. It is also used in many industrial applications and is a common product of combustion of synthetic materials. Typical cyanogens include hydrogen cyanide (AC) and cyanogen chloride (CK). Low levels of cyanide are detoxified by a natural reaction in the human body using the rhodanese system. There is reversible metabolism with Vitamin B12a to Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin). An irreversible reaction occurs with sulfanes to produce thiocyanates and sulfates. The former is excreted via the urinary tract. When cyanide overwhelms this natural process, cyanide binds to (1990) a VX = Venom X (Cieslak and Henretig 2003) cytochrome oxidase within the mitochondria and disrupts cellular respiration. Cyanide has an affinity for Fe+3 in the cytochrome a3 complex and oxidative phosphorylation is interrupted. Cells can no longer use oxygen to produce ATP and lactic acidosis ensues from resultant anaerobic metabolism. When inhaled, cyanide produces rapid onset of clinical signs. Findings include transient tachypnea and Kussmaul breathing (from hypoxia of carotid and aortic bodies), hypertension and tachycardia (from hypoxia of aortic body), and neurologic findings such as seizures, muscle rigidity (trismus), opisthotonus, and decerebrate posturing. Other findings include cherry red flush, acute respiratory failure/ arrest, bradycardia, dissociative shock, and cardiac arrest. Venous blood samples exhibit a bright red color. Arterial blood gas may demonstrate a metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap due to lactic acid (Banks 2014; Cieslak and Henretig 2016; Rotenberg 2003a) .",

Typical examples include chlorine (Cl 2 ), phosgene (carbonyl chloride), oxides of nitrogen, organofluoride polymers, hydrogen fluoride, and zinc oxide. Since many of these chemicals are readily available and have multiple industrial applications, they are considered terrorist weapons of opportunity. Toxicity is dependent upon agent particle size, solubility, and method of release. Large particles produce injury in the nasopharynx (sneezing, pain, and erythema). Midsize particles affect the central airways (painful swelling, cough, stridor, wheezing, and rhonchi). Small particles cause injury at the level of the alveoli (dyspnea, chest tightness, and rales). Highly soluble agents, such as chlorine, dissolve with mucosal moisture and immediately produce strong upper airway reactions. Less soluble agents, such as phosgene, travel to the lower airway before dissolving and subsequently causing toxicity. It is important, however, to realize that very few lungdamaging agents affect only the upper or lower airway (e.g., Cl 2 ). If the agent is aerosolized, solid or liquid droplets suspend in the air and distribute by size. If it is a gas or vapor release, there is uniform distribution throughout the lungs and toxicity will be based on solubility and reactivity of the agent (Banks 2014; Burklow et al. 2003; Cieslak and Henretig 2016) .

Category A agents include organisms with the highest risk because the ease of dissemination or transmission from person-to-person, result in high mortality rates, have the potential for major public health impact, promote public panic and social disruption, and require special action of public health preparedness. These agents/diseases include smallpox (Variola major), anthrax (Bacillus anthracis), plague (Yersinia pestis), viral hemorrhagic fevers (filoviruses [Ebola, Marburg] and arenaviruses [Lassa, Macupo]), botulinum toxin (from Clostridium botulinum), and tularemia (Francisella tularensis). Category B agents, the second highest priority, include those that are moderately easy to disseminate, result in moderate morbidity and low mortality rates, and require specific enhancements of diagnostic capacity and enhanced disease surveillance. These agents/diseases include ricin toxin (Ricinus communis), brucellosis (Brucella species), epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens, food safety threats (Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella), glanders (Burkholderia mallei), meliodosis (Burkholderia pseudomallei), psitticosis (Chlamydia psittaci), typhus fever (Rickettsia prowazekii), Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, trichothecenes mycotoxin, viral encephalitis (alphaviruses, such as eastern equine encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and western equine encephalitis), and water safety threats (Vibrio cholera, Cryptosporidium parvum). Category C agents have the next priority and include emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass dissemination because of availability, ease of production and dissemination, and have the potential for high morbidity and mortality rates and major health impact. Recognition of a biologic attack is essential. There are various epidemiologic clues to consider when determining whether the outbreak is natural or man-made (Markenson et al. 2006; Cieslak 2018; USAMRIID 2014) :",

Other clinical features include extensive fluid loss and hypovolemic shock, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bacterial superinfections, viral bronchitis and pneumonitis, corneal ulceration with or without keratitis, and encephalitis. Death, if it occurs, is typically during the second week of clinical disease. Variola minor caused a mortality of 1% in unvaccinated individuals.

Also, due to electrolyte and protein loss, replacement therapy will be required. Bacterial superinfections must be aggressively treated with appropriate antibiotics. Biologic countermeasures and antivirals against smallpox are under investigation, including cidofovir, brincidovir (CMX-001), and tecovirimat (ST-246). These agents have shown efficacy in orthopoxvirus animal models and have been used to treat disseminated vaccinia infection under emergency use. Cidofovir has activity against poxviruses in animal studies (in vitro and in vivo) and some humans (eczema vaccinatum and molluscum contagiosum). Brincidovir is an oral formulation of cidofovir with less nephrotoxicity and has recently been announced as an addition to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) for patients with smallpox. Tecovirimat is a potent and specific inhibitor of orthopoxvirus replication. A recent study found that treatment with tecovirimat resulted in 100% survival of cynomolgus macaques challenged with intravenous variola virus. The disease was milder in tecovirimat-treated survivors and viral shedding was reduced compared to placebo-treated survivors. Prophylaxis comes in the form of the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia virus), ACAM2000 \u00ae , which replaced Wyeth Dryvax\u2122 in 2007. Safety profile of the two vaccines appears to be similar. Side effects of vaccination range from low-grade fever and axillary lymphadenopathy to inadvertent inoculation of the virus to other body sites to generalized vaccinia and cardiac events (myopericarditis). Rare, but typically fatal complications include progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, postvaccination encephalomyelitis, and fetal vaccinia. Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) Smallpox Vaccine (Bavarian Nordic's IMVAMUNE \u00ae ) is a live, highly attenuated, viral vaccine that is under development as a future nonreplicating smallpox vaccine (Greenberg et al. 2016; Kennedy and Greenberg 2009 ). Passive immunoprophylaxis exists in the form of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) and is used for primarily treating complications from smallpox vaccine. Limited information suggests that VIG may be of use in postexposure prophylaxis of smallpox if given the first week after exposure and with vaccination. Monoclonal antibodies may represent another form of immunoprophylaxis. Postexposure administration of human monoclonal antibodies has protected rabbits from a lethal dose of an orthopoxvirus. As mentioned, smallpox is highly communicable person-to-person (Table 5 .25). Contact precautions with full personal protective equipment (PPE) are required. Airborne isolation with the use of an N-95 mask is needed for baseline protection. An N-95 mask or powered airpurifying respirator (PAPR) is recommended for protection during high risk procedures (Beigel and Sandrock 2009; Goff et al. 2018; Rotz et al. 2005; Pittman et al. 2018 ; USAMRIID 2014).",

For inhalational anthrax, antibiotic treatment is unlikely to be effective unless started before respiratory symptoms develop. Treatment (Table 5 .22) includes ciprofloxacin (or levofloxacin or doxycycline), clindamycin, and penicillin G. Raxibacumab, a monoclonal antibody, was approved by the FDA in 2012 for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in combination with recommended antibiotic regimens and prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax when other therapies are unavailable or inappropriate. It works by inhibiting anthrax antigen binding to cells and, therefore, prevents toxins from entering cells (Kummerfeldt 2014) . The adult dose is 40 mg/kg given IV over 2 h and 15 min. The dose for children is weight based; \u226415 kg: 80 mg/kg; >15-50 kg: 60 mg/kg; >50 kg: 40 mg/kg. Premedication with diphenhydramine IV or PO is recommended 1 h before the infusion. It can also be used as postexposure prophylaxis in high risk spore exposure cases (Cieslak and Henretig 2016; Migone et al. 2009 ; The Medical Letter 2013). Obiltoxaximab (Anthim) is a recently approved monoclonal antibody treatment for inhalational anthrax in combination with recommended antibiotic regimens and prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax when other therapies are unavailable or inappropriate. Adults and children >40 kg should receive a single obiltoxaximab dose of 16 mg/kg. The recommended dose is 24 mg/kg for children >15-40 kg and 32 mg/kg for those weighing \u226415 kg. Premedication with diphenhydramine is recommended to reduce risk of hypersensitivity reactions (The Medical Letter 2018). In patients with inhalational anthrax, intravenous anthrax immune globulin (Anthrasil) should be considered in addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy (Mytle et al. 2013 ; The Medical Letter 2016; USAMRIID 2014). Postexposure prophylaxis includes ciprofloxacin (or levofloxacin or doxycycline) for 60 days plus administration of vaccine; since spores can persist in human In addition to appropriate antibiotic regimen, monoclonal antibody therapy (see text for dosing) and intravenous anthrax immune globulin should be administered for inhalational anthrax c Levofloxacin or ofloxacin may be an acceptable alternative to ciprofloxacin d Rifampin or clarithromycin may be acceptable alternatives to clindamycin as a drug that targets bacterial protein synthesis. If ciprofloxacin or another quinolone is employed, doxycycline may be used as a second agent because it also targets protein synthesis e Ampicillin, imipenem, meropenem, or chloramphenicol may be acceptable alternatives to penicillin as drugs with good CNS penetration f Assuming the organism is sensitive, children may be switched to oral amoxicillin (40-80 mg/kg/d divided q8 h) to complete a 60-day course. The first 14 days of therapy of postexposure prophylaxis, however, should include ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin and/or doxycycline regardless of age. Vaccination should also be provided; if not, antibiotic course will need to be longer g According to most experts, ciprofloxacin is the preferred agent for oral prophylaxis h Ten days of therapy may be adequate for endemic cutaneous disease. A full 60-day course is recommended in the setting of terrorism, however, because of the possibility of concomitant inhalational exposure tissues for a long time, antibiotics must be given for a longer period if vaccine is not also given. The Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA BioThrax\u2122) is derived from sterile culture fluid supernatant taken from an attenuated strain of Bacillus anthracis and does not contain any live or dead organisms. The vaccine is given 0.5 mL intramuscularly at 0 and 4 weeks then at 6, 12, and 18 months followed by yearly boosters (Pittman et al. 2018; USAMRIID 2014) . Consult with CDC for current pediatric recommendations. Anthrax is not contagious in the vegetative form during clinical illness (Table 5 .25). Contact with infected animals increases likelihood of spread. Therefore, contact should be limited and the use of appropriate PPE in endemic areas is indicated (Beigel and Sandrock 2009; Purcell et al. 2018; USAMRIID 2014) .",

After a rodent population dies off, the fleas search for other sources of blood, namely humans. This is when large outbreaks of human plague occur. Pneumonic plague is a very rare disease and when it is present in a patient, it may be highly suspicious for intentional dispersal of this deadly agent.

A lethal dose is 1 ng per kilogram. It is 100,000 times more toxic than sarin (GB). There are seven serotypes of botulinum toxin (A through G). A new serotype (H) has been tentatively identified in a case of infant botulism but has not been fully investigated. Most common are serotypes A, B, and E. The toxin acts on the presynaptic nerve terminal of the neuromuscular junction and cholinergic autonomic synapses. This disrupts neurotransmission and leads to clinical findings. There are three forms of botulism: foodborne, wound, and intestinal (infant or adult intestinal). Botulinum toxin can also be released as an act of bioterrorism via ingestion or aerosol forms. Incubation can be from 12 h after exposure to several days later. Clinical findings of botulism include cranial nerve palsies such as ptosis, diplopia, and dysphagia. This is followed by symmetric descending flaccid paralysis. However, the victim remains afebrile, alert, and oriented. Death is typically due to respiratory failure. Prolonged respiratory support is often required (1-3 months).",

BAT was developed at USAMRIID as one of two equine-derived heptavalent BoNT antitoxins. BAT is approved to treat individuals with symptoms of botulism following a known or suspected exposure. It has the potential to cause hypersensitivity reactions in those sensitive to equine proteins. The safety of BAT in pregnant and lactating women is unknown. Evidence regarding safety and efficacy in the pediatric population is limited. In 2003, the FDA approved Botulinum Immune Globulin Intravenous (BabyBIG), a human botulism immune globulin derived from pooled plasma of adults immunized with pentavalent botulinum toxoid. It is indicated for the treatment of infants with botulism from toxin serotypes A and B. Immediately after clinical diagnosis of botulism, adults (including pregnant women) and children should receive a single intravenous infusion of antitoxin (BAT or, for infants with botulism from serotypes A or B, BabyBIG) to prevent further disease progression. The administration of antitoxin should not be delayed for laboratory testing to confirm the diagnosis.

External contamination occurs when radioactive material is carried on a person after exposure. This person can then contaminate others. Removing contaminated clothing eliminates 90% of the toxin. Others are then less vulnerable to exposure. Internal contamination is when a radioactive substance enters the body through inhalation, ingestion, or translocation through open skin. Incorporation is internalization of the toxin into body organs. Incorporation is dependent on the chemical and not the radiological properties of the radioactive toxin. Radioactive iodine, 131 I, is taken up by the thyroid gland because iodine enters the gland as part of normal physiology (Advanced Hazmat Life Support (AHLS) 2003).",

Other factors include the collapse of building or structure from the blast, promptness of the rescue operation, and the caliber and proximity of medical resources in the vicinity. Victims who experience explosions in closed spaces are especially vulnerable to more severe injuries. Twenty-nine case reports of injuries from terrorist bombings were reviewed (Arnold et al. 2004a) . The investigators compared the injury severity of victims of explosions who sustained injuries from structural collapse, closed space explosions without structural collapse, and open space explosions. The mortality rate for these victims was 25%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. Hospitalization rates were 25%, 36%, and 15%, respectively. ED visits were 48%, 36%, and 15%, respectively. Victims of closed space explosions without structural collapse experienced greater hospitalizations rates than those involved in a structural collapse, because many of the victims involved in the structural collapse experienced immediate death.",

            "text": "An explosion is defined as a rapid chemical conversion of a liquid or solid into a gas with energy release. Substances that are chemically predisposed to explosion, called explosives, are characterized as low or high order, depending on the speed and magnitude of energy release. Low-order explosives release energy at a relatively slow pace and explosions from these substances tend not to produce large air pressure changes or a \"blast.\" The energy release is caused by combustion, producing heat. The involved material \"goes up in flames.\" Gunpowder, liquid fuel, and Molotov cocktails are examples of low-order explosives (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010). Explosions from high-order materials cause a blast with a pressure wave in addition to causing the release of heat and light. The blast pressure wave causes compression of the surrounding medium which is physically transformed in all directions from the exact point of explosion. When an explosion occurs on land, air is the surrounding medium compressed. In bodies of water, the surrounding medium is water. The degree of medium compression and the distance that the energy wave travels is determined by the magnitude of the explosion. The power of the blast is measured in pounds per square inch (psi). The pressure blast wave has distinctive characteristics. The amplitude of the wave reaches its highest point immediately after the blast. The blast wave then rapidly decays as it travels through space. As the blast wave propagates, and compresses the surrounding medium, it leaves a vacuum because of displaced molecules in the surrounding medium and a negative phase of the wave ensues. In a land explosion, air molecules are displaced by the initial positive pressure, after which a negative pressure occurs in the vacated space. A wave that propagates through a confined space rebounds off of the wall and reverberates. It may interact with victims in the confined space many times, causing more severe injuries (Stuhmiller et al. 1991) (Fig. 5.10 ).",

Injury potential depends on the wave's amplitude as well as the slopes of its increase and decrease in pressure. X-axis refers to time and Y-axis refers to pressure. (Jacobson and Severin 2012) also known as the \"spalling effect.\" As the negative pressure phase of the blast wave propagates through, it causes more stress on the tissue and further damage. In addition to damaging tissues with an air tissue interface, pressure blasts can cause injury to the brain and can lead to limb detachments. Despite the fact that primary blast injuries can be ravaging, they are less common than other types of injury from blasts. The tympanic membranes, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract are the most common organs sustaining injury from pressure waves. The tympanic membrane is the most vulnerable of these three organ systems (DePalma et al. 2005; Garth 1997) . Five psi, which is considered a weak blast, will rupture 50% of tympanic membranes. To put this in perspective, C4, a commonly used explosive generates a pressure of four million psi. Otoscopy can reveal ruptured tympanic membranes. Neuropraxia, deafness, tinnitus, and vertigo are symptoms that can be experienced. Severe blast injuries of the ear can result in damage to the organ of Corti, resulting in permanent hearing loss.",

Lung injuries are more likely to occur from a blast within a closed space, or when victims sustain burns (burns commonly cause acute lung injury from release of inflammatory mediators). Direct alveolar damage, blood vessel with bleeding, and inflammation are the three different manifestations of lung injury from blasts. Alveolar damage can cause pneumothorax and pulmonary interstitial emphysema. When air dissects along the bronchovascular sheath, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, and subcutaneous emphysema can occur. Air that enters the pulmonary venous system can result in a systemic arterial air embolism, and possibly, a stroke. Inflammation of the lungs from direct pressure damage to the tissue, cause acute lung injury and possibly, disseminated intravascular coagulation. Clinical signs of lung injury include tachypnea, chest pain, hypoxia, rales, and dyspnea. If there is vascular disruption, hemoptysis can occur. Air leaks from alveolar injury can result in diminished breath sounds, subcutaneous crepitance, increased resonance, and tracheal deviation. Hemodynamic compromise will occur with tracheal deviation. Alveolar damage, leading to air in the pulmonary venous system, can lead to a systemic arterial air embolism. Air in the coronary arteries can lead to coronary ischemia with ST and/or T waves changes on ECG. Air embolism to cerebral arteries leads to cerebral vascular accidents (strokes) with focal neurological deficits. Other manifestations of systemic air embolism include mottling of the skin, demarcated tongue blanching, and/or air in the retinal vessels (the most common sign of arterial air embolus). Rapid death after initial survival is most often caused by arterial air embolus. Initiation of positive pressure ventilation may trigger this event (Ho and Ling 1999) . A lung injury from a blast can also precipitate a vagal reflex resulting in bradycardia and hypotension. It is postulated that this occurs from the stimulation of C fibers in the lungs (Guy et al. 1998 ).",

Many agencies and organizations record and publish data on these incidents. The measurement and reporting does vary based on the absence of a common definition.

The Congressional Research Service (CRS) defines mass shootings as events where more than four people are killed with a firearm \"within one event, and in one or more locations in close proximity.\" Congress uses the term mass killings and describes these events as \"three or more killings in a single incident.\" The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) uses the term active shooter, which it defines as \"an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.\" It is important to realize that nongovernmental ( Ranking third of all locations for 2016 and 2017, seven of the 50 incidents occurred in educational environments resulting in five killed and 19 wounded. Two incidents occurred in elementary schools, resulting in two killed (including a firstgrade student) and eight wounded (one teacher shot, three students shot, and four wounded from shrapnel). One incident occurred in a junior/senior high school, resulting in none killed and four wounded (two from shrapnel, all students). Four incidents occurred at high schools (one outside a school during prom), resulting in three killed (all students) and seven wounded (all students). Fortunately, no incident occurred at institutions of higher learning during 2016 or 2017 (Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center, Texas State University and Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice 2018). Notably, two of the 50 incidents occurred in houses of worship, resulting in 27 killed and 27 wounded. One of these incidents occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and had the third highest number of casualties (26 killed and 20 wounded) in 2017. The dead included 10 women, 7 men, 8 children (7 girls and 1 boy), and an unborn child (Goldman et al. 2017) .",

Overall, there was an increase in number of active shooter incidents and casualties per year. Location categories with number of incidents and statistics of their contribution were provided: areas of educational environments account for a large portion of locations for active shooter incidents, ranking only second to commercial areas. Of the 37 incidents (14.8%) occurring at schools, one took place at a nursery (pre-K) school and one incident occurred during a school board meeting that was being hosted on school property but no students were involved (neither perpetrator or victim). The remainder (35 incidents) were perpetrated by or against students, faculty, and/or staff at K-12 schools (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2018). Finally, 15 active shooter incidents (6%) did occur at institutions of higher learning. As a reminder, no incident occurred at institutions of higher learning during 2016 or 2017.

The shooter committed suicide at the scene, before police arrived a In A Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013, the FBI identified 11 locations where the public was most at risk during an incident. These location categories include commercial areas (divided into business open to pedestrian traffic, businesses closed to pedestrian traffic, and malls), education environments (divided into schools [prekindergarten through 12th grade] and institutions of higher learning), open spaces, government properties (divided into military and other government properties), residences, houses of worship, and health care facilities. In 2018, the FBI added a new location category, Other Location, to capture incidents that occurred in venues not included in the 11 previously identified locations (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2017). This table only includes educational environments. An entire list of all incidents from 2000 to 2017 at all locations can be found at https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/activeshooter-incidents- 2000 .pdf/view (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2018 Prevention means the capabilities necessary to avoid, deter, or stop an imminent crime or threatened/actual mass casualty incident. Prevention is the action schools take to prevent a threatened or actual incident from occurring. Protection means the capabilities to secure schools against acts of violence and man-made or natural disasters. Protection focuses on ongoing actions that protect students, teachers, staff, visitors, districts, networks, and property from a threat or hazard. Mitigation means the capabilities necessary to eliminate or reduce the loss of life and property damage by lessening the impact of an event or emergency at the school. It also means reducing the likelihood that threats and hazards will happen. Response means the school's or school district's capabilities necessary to stabilize an emergency once it has already happened or is certain to happen in an unpreventable way, establish a safe and secure environment, save lives and property, and facilitate the transition to recovery. Recovery means the capabilities necessary to assist schools affected by an event or emergency in restoring the learning environment. It also means teaming with community partners to restore educational programming, the physical environment, business operations, and social, emotional, and behavioral health. The majority of Prevention, Protection, and Mitigation activities generally occur before an incident, although these three mission areas do have ongoing activities that can occur throughout an active shooter incident. Response activities occur during an incident, and recovery activities can begin during an incident and occur after an incident (United States Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Safe and Healthy Students 2013; United States Department of Homeland Security 2018b; United States Department of Homeland Security 2018).",

Effective preventative and protective actions decrease the probability that schools (or other facilities) will encounter incidents of gun violence or should an incident occur, it reduces the impact of that incident. The guide emphasizes that the level of security at a facility will be based on hazards relevant to the facility, people, or groups associated with it. It also warns that as new or different threats become apparent, the perception of the relative security changes and insecurity should drive change to reflect the level of confidence of the people of groups associated with the facility. The DHS utilizes a Hometown Security approach that emphasizes the process of Connect, Plan, Train, and Report (CPTR) with the objective to realize effective, collaborative outcomes (United States Department of Homeland Security 2018b).",

            "text": "The initial phase is Connect and occurs by a school or district reaching out and developing relationships in the community, including local law enforcement. Having these relationships before an incident or event can help speed up the response when something happens. Each school must begin with identification or development of a security team, group, or organization. This phase also emphasizes outreach, collaboration, and building of a coalition. There should be coalition members from within a school and may include district/school administrators, teachers, aides, facility operations personnel, human resources, administrative, counseling, and student groups. External groups directly related to the school might include boards of education, parent organizations, mental health groups/agencies, and teacher and bus driver unions. External groups indirectly related to the school include all responder organizations such as police and fire departments, sheriff's office, emergency medical services, emergency management, and the local DHS Protective Security Advisor (PSA). Other tangential groups such as volunteer organizations, utility providers, and facilities in close geographic proximity should also be considered. Core and advisory members of the coalition are established. A coalition champion is also identified and is the person who owns the majority of the responsibility for achieving a school's security goals. The champion organizes the coalition as it grows and matures (United States Department of Homeland Security 2018b). The next phase is Plan. This will bring the coalition together. The Guide for Developing High Quality School Emergency Operations Plans (United States Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Safe and Healthy Students 2013) is an excellent resource for the coalition. A School Security Survey for Gun Violence can be completed and the coalition or user can quickly and effectively determine a facility's security proficiency (United States Department of Homeland Security. 2018). Specific portions of or topics within a school plan should be assigned to individuals, committees, or working groups most qualified to address them. The planning process must be sustainable. The amount of time spent in the planning phase should be commensurate with the amount of effort expended on the other phases (United States Department of Homeland Security 2018b). The next phase of the process is to Train on the plan developed by the coalition. Determining who is responsible for what and how it should be done is the basic function of planning. In fact, telling various members of the team what is expected of them and when to do that activity is the function of training. It is vital to utilize the curricula development expertise possessed by the K-12 community. School administrators should take advantage of this skill set and find creative ways to address difficult topics, such as gun violence. It should be carried out in an effective and nontraumatic way. Presenting the training in pieces or steps allows for a more comprehensive learning experience. It is important to validate training through exercises and drills, all of which should include the students. The training event should be followed by the completion and implementation of an after-action improvement plan with adjustment of the CPTR as indicated (United States Department of Homeland Security 2018b). The final phase in the process is Report. The reporting phase is arguably the most important of all the phases. Reporting principles underlie the other three phases and have profound prevention and protection impacts by driving forward information. DHS models the reporting phase using the \"If You See Something, Say Something \u00ae \" campaign (U.S. DHS, 2018) and the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiative (Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative (NSI) 2019). \"If You See Something, Say Something \u00ae \" focuses on empowering anyone who sees suspicious activity to do something about it by contacting local law enforcement, or if an emergency to call 9-1-1 (United States Department of Homeland Security 2018a). This is a compelling capability when well organized and managed. A good plan for reporting, especially for a K-12 school, involves training staff and students on what is considered suspicious. There are many methods in which schools can employ to facilitate this, such as dedicated telephone numbers, websites for anonymous reporting, email or text messaging, and mobile phone applications. Conducting simple drills for reporters and receivers keeps skills sharp and reinforces the importance of the effort with the goal to save lives. If the plan includes sharing all suspicious activity calls with the local fusion center then the probability of higher fidelity reporting increases (United States Department of Homeland Security 2018b).",

            "text": "It is important to understand that no \"profile\" exists for an active shooter (United States Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Safe and Healthy Students 2013). However, research indicates there may be signs or indicators. O'Toole (2000) presents an in depth, systematic procedure for school shooter threat assessment and intervention. The model was designed to be used by educators, mental health professionals, and law enforcement agencies. Its fundamental building blocks are the threat assessment standards, which provide a framework for evaluating a spoken, written, and symbolic threat, and the fourpronged assessment approach which provides a logical, methodical process to examine the threatener and assess the risk that the threat will be carried out. Schools should learn the signs of a potentially volatile situation that may develop into an active shooter situation and proactively seek ways to prevent an incident with internal resources, or additional external assistance (United States Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Safe and Healthy Students 2013). Potential warning signs of a school shooter may include increasingly erratic, unsafe, or aggressive behaviors; hostile feelings of injustice or perceived wrongdoing; drug and alcohol abuse; marginalization or distancing from friends and colleagues; changes in performance at work or school; sudden and dramatic changes in home life or in personality; pending civil or criminal litigation; and observable grievances with threats and plans of retribution (United States Department of Homeland Security 2018b). At a minimum, schools should establish and enforce policies that prohibit, limit, or determine unacceptable behaviors and consequences of weapons possession/use, drug possession/use, alcohol/tobacco possession/use, bullying/harassment, hazing, cyber-bullying/harassment/stalking, sexual assault/misconduct/harassment, bias crimes, social media abuse, and any criminal acts (United States Department of Homeland Security 2018b).",

The Team should include mental health professionals (e.g., forensic psychologist, clinical psychologist, and school psychologist) to contribute to the threat assessment process (United States Department of Homeland Security 2018b). It is the responsibility of the TAT to investigate and analyze communications and behaviors to make a determination on whether or not an individual poses a threat to him/herself or others (United States Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Safe and Healthy Students 2013). As well as TATs, some schools have even opted to establish social media monitoring teams which look for keywords that may indicate bullying or other concerning statements. If a school opts to create such a team, it should work very closely with the TAT to ensure that applicable privacy, civil rights and civil liberties, other federal, state and local laws, and information sharing protocols are followed. Please refer to Chap. 14 for further information.",

            "text": "After an active shooter incident, field triage (e.g., JumpSTART) must commence and the patient must be evaluated by an experienced emergency medicine or trauma surgeon, preferably by a pediatric specialist in those disciplines. If an active shooter incident is coupled with detonation of an explosive device, the child must be screened and decontaminated for radiation exposure (\"dirty bomb\"). Triage tags are extremely helpful when multiple victims present in a short period of time. Medical response to an active shooter event will focus on control of external hemorrhage along with circulatory stabilization. Operative emergencies will be common and receive the highest priority. Severe extremity injuries may be controlled with tourniquet application or other forms of hemorrhage control. Re-evaluation is paramount to prevent ischemia to distal regions. However, thoracic or abdominal (truncal) injuries will need immediate surgical exploration and intervention. Penetrating trauma will cause more vascular injuries than blunt trauma, and vascular surgical trays may be in short supply at a hospital. Major procedure or surgical trays may become short in supply based on the increased operative demand. Resuscitative blood transfusion therapy may utilize a massive blood transfusion protocol. Since whole blood may be short in supply, some will simply use the 1:1:1 rule (administer one unit of packed cells: one unit of fresh frozen plasma: one unit of platelets). A unit for children may be substituted as an aliquot based on size of the patient (e.g., administer 10 mL/kg of packed cells: 10 mL/kg of fresh frozen plasma: 10 mL/kg of platelets). Calcium must also be replaced when there is a large volume transfusion. Due to extensive blood product utilization, there may be a heavy impact on institutional or regional blood supplies. Plans should be in place to address these problems, including the implementation of allocation of scarce resources. Mental health support and staff debriefs are essential and should be included after an active shooter event (Hick et al. 2016 ).",

            "text": "NGO) organizations (Mother Jones, USA Today, and the Stanford Mass Shootings in America [MSA] data project) use various combinations of these definitions. The exclusion of gang-or drugrelated incidents, the accidental discharge of a firearm, or family-and intimate partner-related shootings further complicates the definition of mass shooting. Mother Jones, the FBI, CRS, the MSA, and Congress do not include these incidents in their definitions, but USA Today does (Office for Victims of Crime, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice 2019). The FBI has released investigative reports of active shooter events occurring from 2000 to 2013 (Blair and Schweit 2014) as well as 2014 and 2015 (Schweit 2016). In April 2018, the FBI, in collaboration with the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center, published a supplemental report reviewing the active shooter incidents in the U.S. for 2016 and 2017. The report revealed striking differences about active shooter incidents from 2016 and 2017 as compared to 2014 and 2015 (Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center, Texas State University and Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice 2018). The report also compared the characteristics of the active shooters from both time periods (Tables 5.28 and 5.29) (Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center, Texas State University and Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice 2018). Geographically, the 50 active shooter incidents in 2016 and 2017 occurred in 21 states: six in Texas, five in California and Florida, four in Ohio, three in Maryland and Washington, two in Colorado, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin, and one in Arizona, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, and South Carolina. The 50 incidents resulted in 943 casualties (221 people killed and 722 people wounding, excluding shooters). The highest number of casualties (58 killed and 489 wounded) occurred during the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2017. The second highest number of casualties (49 killed and 53 wounded) occurred at Pulse, a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016. The third highest number of casualties (26 killed and 20 wounded) occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017 (Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center, Texas State University and Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice 2018). Of note, in the 2000-2013 report,(Blair and Schweit 2014) the FBI identified 11 locations where the public was most at risk during an active shooter incident. These location categories include commercial areas (divided into businesses open to pedestrian traffic, businesses closed to pedestrian traffic, and malls), education environments (divided into schools [prekindergarten through 12th grade] and institutions of higher learning), open spaces, government properties (divided into military and other government properties), residences, houses of worship, and health care facilities. For the April 2018 report of 2016 and 2017 active shooter incidents, theTable 5.28 Active shooter incidents in the United States for 2014 and 2015 versus 2016 Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center, Texas State University and Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice 2018)",

The SNS is deployed along with a Federal Medical Station Strike Team who have in-depth knowledge of the stockpile and supply operations (Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, United States Department of Health and Human Services 2018). The SNS, depending upon the threat, is intended to only supplement state and local supplies used for immediate care during the initial response. Contents are prepacked and configured in transport-ready containers for rapid delivery anywhere in the U.S. within 12 h of the federal decision to deploy (Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, United States Department of Health and Human Services 2018). However, the federal recommendation is to always maintain a local stockpile of supplies to support patients, families, and staff independently for at least 96 h (Illinois Emergency Medical Services for Children 2018).

A full list of all chemical or biological events since 1900 (with references and sources of data) can be found at http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/terrorism/chembioattacks.html. Although there were some earlier instances of chemical/biological warfare prior to 1900, these instances were generally of very limited effectiveness. Note that some incidents are disputed, and casualty figures in some cases are very uncertain. The following events are included: use in warfare: multiple attacks within a war are grouped together; use by terrorists: includes attacks with larger numbers of casualties; and other: several criminal incidents and accidental chemical releases are included because of their significance.
