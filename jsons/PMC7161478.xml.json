The American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP] (2020a) suggested that children play outside while maintaining social distancing so that they had time to move and explore nature.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, physician groups have lobbied Federal and State Governments to relax the rules on telehealth to provide care to more children across state lines and in rural areas of the country. The AAP (2020c) is working at the Federal level with the Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP) and with other third-party insurers to reduce barriers and increase access to telehealth care. Still, amid the COVID-19 crisis, there is a long way to go to overcome obstacles to telehealth provisions for all children. The AAP (2020d) is keeping a current list of states which are allowing telehealth, the rules, and regulations and publicizes this list for pediatric care providers. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause a paradigm shift that relaxes restrictions imposed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), state laws, and insurance reimbursement for telehealth.",

Some teachers may have experienced fear and trepidation with transferring their classrooms online, but the majority have done so at a rapid pace and in a short period; in the long run, everyone seems to be adapting well. The digital divide is more apparent than ever (Guernsey, Ishmael, & Prescott, 2020). Children who are proficient with using computers are ready for it.

Some families may share one computer; others may not own a computer at all. We need to find ways through partnerships with government, business, and educational systems to provide computers and Internet access for all learners. During this pandemic, some Internet companies have graciously offered their services for free (e.g., Comcast and Charter Spectrum) for a limited time to low income families (Guernsey et al., 2020). Caregivers may need to work with younger children to show them how to work a computer.

Schools are required by law to provide special needs children with free and adequate public education and special services (US Department of Education, 2020). During the COVID-19 pandemic, school districts were continuing to provide special needs children with therapeutic services online. Delivery of specialized therapy online opens the possibilities for services to children with special needs in remote areas who may not have previously had access. IEPs are traditionally complete on reams of paper; because of COVID-19 and school closures, now experts can meet online in synchronous or asynchronous forums with some completing the IEPs in an electronic format (Silva, 2020).",
