Nanomaterials are increasingly finding uses in products such as antimicrobial surface coatings and semiconductors. These include spherical, cubic, and needle-like nanoscaled particles (approximately 5\u2013100 nm) and near-nanoscaled devices (up to micrometers) [1]. Properties of nanoparticles, for example, their active surface area, chemical reactivity, and biological activity, can be dramatically different from those of micrometer-sized particles [2], and indeed the biocidal effectiveness of metallic nanoparticles has been suggested to be due to both their size and their high surface-to-volume ratio. These characteristics should allow them to closely interact with microbial membranes, and thus elicit an antimicrobial effect that is not solely due to the release of metal ions [3]. Metallic and other nanoparticles are now being combined with polymers and other base materials, and coated onto surfaces which may have a variety of potential antimicrobial applications within the oral cavity [4], [5].",

The composition of the microbial flora of the mouth thus varies considerably from site to site and at different time points. Up to 1000 different species of bacteria at 108\u2013109 bacteria per mL saliva or mg dental plaque are known to be associated with the oral cavity, and it has been suggested that only 50% of the bacteria found at these sites can be cultured [6].",

The relative contribution of different bacterial components in such infections is thus difficult to determine. Oral infections may arise either from an endogenous source, that is, one yielding microorganisms normally found in the mouth, such as plaque-related dental caries and periodontal disease, or an exogenous source yielding microorganisms not normally found as part of the oral microflora. Dental caries and periodontal disease involve the adherence of bacteria and development of biofilms on both the natural and restored tooth surface. The use of nanotechnology offers the possibility to control the formation of these and other oral biofilms through the use of nanoparticles with biocidal, antiadhesive, and delivery capabilities.",

On the tooth surface the initial colonizers adhere to the acquired pellicle, a salivary/dietary-derived proteinaceous layer, which can then influence the subsequent sequence of colonization by microorganisms [8]. The acquired pellicle also contains several salivary components such as secretory immunoglobulin A and lysozyme, and these provide both barrier and buffering functions [9]. Both de- and remineralization processes of the teeth are also mediated by the pellicle. In terms of bacterial colonization, many of the proteins that make up the pellicle act as receptors for the specific interaction with adhesins on the surface of pioneer bacterial species [9]. The pellicle layer is therefore of particular relevance for the interactions of both bacteria and nanoparticles with the tooth surface.\n",

The major growth of dental plaque mass then occurs by bacterial cell division within the biofilm rather than by coaggregation at the surface of the developing biofilm [10]. The initial communities of bacteria found within the supragingival plaque biofilm are of a relatively low diversity in comparison to those present in the mature communities of both supra- and subgingival plaque. Initial colonizers include Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus mitis. The coaggregating partners with these bacteria would then include predominantly Gram-negative species, for example, Veillonella atypica, Eikenella corrodens, and Prevotella loescheii. Coaggregation bridges between these early colonizers and Fusobacterium nucleatum are common and the latter then coaggregates with numerous late colonizers. Late colonizers include Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis\n[10]. The interactions between oral bacteria are integral to biofilm development and maturation and include physical contact, metabolic exchange, molecular communication, and genetic material exchange.",

These maintain the structural integrity of the biofilm and provide an ideal matrix for bacterial cell growth and survival [11]. The biofilm mode of growth is clearly distinguished from planktonic growth by a number of features, which includes the resistance to antimicrobial agents at concentrations that approach 1000 times greater than that required to kill planktonic microorganisms [12], [13].

The disease process involves acidogenic plaque bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Lactobacillus spp. [14], whereas periodontal diseases can involve both the soft and hard tissues and are initiated by components of the plaque biofilm that develop on the hard root surface adjacent to the soft tissues of the supporting periodontium. Periodontal disease may be confined to the gingiva (gingivitis) or extend to the deeper supporting structures with destruction of the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone that supports the teeth (periodontitis). This loss of attachment, with associated periodontal pocket formation, may ultimately lead to loosening and loss of the affected teeth. P. gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and T. denticola are now regarded as the major pathogens in advancing periodontitis [15].",

This infection is a key cause of dental implant failure whereby the induced inflammatory changes in the soft tissues surrounding oral implants lead to a progressive destruction of the supporting bone (classified as peri-implantitis and seen in up to 43% of implant-treated subjects) or soft tissues (classified as peri-implant mucositis and seen in up to 50% of implant-treated subjects) [19].

In contrast, agents classified as antimicrobial act by inhibiting the growth of (bacteriostatic) or killing (bactericidal) microorganisms, which are defined as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), respectively. The uptake and penetration of antimicrobial agents into biofilms are key considerations in the administration of therapeutics [21]. This is of particular importance within the oral cavity when these agents have to reach less accessible stagnation sites or through plaque to the enamel. The development of plaque control measures that require a minimum of patient compliance and professional healthcare intervention are therefore of particular interest [22]. Within this context, antimicrobial nanoparticles may be of particular value if retained at approximal teeth surfaces and below the gum margin. The anticaries potential of fluoride and other conventional antimicrobial/antiplaque agents, which are mostly deployed in mouthwashes and toothpastes, have been well characterized [16]. The potential of nanoparticles as constituents of topical agents to control oral biofilms through either their biocidal or antiadhesive capabilities has now emerged as an area that should be given serious consideration. The studies by Robinson and coworkers using the \u201cLeeds in situ model,\u201d a device that allows dental plaque to develop in situ on a removable human enamel surface, have helped in the assessment of novel antimicrobial agents and take into account the extremely complex microbial composition and architecture of plaque biofilms [23]. The use of such intact biofilms on natural tooth surfaces would be of particular value to a study of the penetration of nanoparticles and released ions. This model has indicated that plaque contains voids and channels, sometimes extending completely through the biomass to the underlying enamel [24] and may have considerable influence on the transfer of nanoparticles through biofilms. The main considerations are the physical and chemical characteristics of the particular nanoparticles used, including the surface charge and degree of hydrophobicity, the surface area-to-mass ratio of the plaque biofilm and the ability of the particles to adsorb to/be taken up at the biofilm surface. Within this context nanoparticles are potentially useful because it is possible to alter their surface charge, hydrophobicity, and other physical and chemical characteristics [25].",

In comparison to other metals, silver is relatively less toxic to human cells, albeit at very low concentrations. Ag+ ions have been considered for a range of biomedical applications, including their use within the dental field as an antibacterial component in dental resin composites [42]. Silver also exhibits a strong affinity for zeolite, a porous crystalline material of hydrated aluminosilicate which can bind up to 40% Ag+ ions within its structure. Silver zeolite has been incorporated into tissue conditioners, acrylic resins, and mouth rinses within the dental field [43], [44], [45], [46]. Silver nanoparticles (Fig. 10.1C), either alone or together with other antimicrobial agents, have shown particularly encouraging results [27], [47], [48]. The use of silver salt nanoparticles instead of elemental silver or complex silver compounds to prevent biofilm formation on surfaces for both biomedical and more general use has been investigated. Using silver bromide precipitation to synthesize polymer-nanocomposites, surfaces comprised of this material were shown to resist biofilm formation. It was also shown to be possible, through controlling the size of the embedded AgBr, to modify the release of biocidal Ag+ ions [49].",

            "text": "Surprisingly little is known about how nanoparticles behave in relation to microorganisms, particularly at the cellular level. The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of silver is not completely understood, but is likely to involve multiple targets in comparison to the more defined targets of antibiotics. Studies have shown that the positive charge on the Ag+ ion is critical for antimicrobial activity, allowing the electrostatic attraction between the negative charge of the bacterial cell membrane and positively charged nanoparticles [36]. In regards to molecular mechanisms of the inhibitory action of Ag+ ions on microorganisms, it has been shown that DNA loses its ability to replicate [50], and the expression of ribosomal subunit proteins and other cellular proteins and enzymes necessary for ATP production become inactive [51]. It has also been hypothesized that Ag+ ions affect membrane-bound respiratory enzymes [52]. However, the precise mechanism(s) of biocidal activity of silver nanoparticles against bacteria remains to be fully elucidated. The work of Sondi and Salopek-Sondi [27] demonstrated structural changes and damage to bacterial membranes resulting in cell death. These particular studies suggest that sulfur-containing proteins in the membrane or inside the cells and phosphorus-containing elements, such as DNA, are likely to be the preferential binding sites for silver nanoparticles. The contribution of Ag+ ion release from nanoparticles to the overall antimicrobial activity remains unclear. It is suggested that a bacterial cell in contact with silver nanoparticles will take up Ag+ ions, which possibly in turn will inhibit respiratory enzymes and so help to generate free radicals, and subsequent free-radical-induced damage to the cell membrane. In order to determine the relationship between free-radical formation and antimicrobial activity, the use of antioxidants suggests that free radicals may be derived from the surface of silver nanoparticles [36].",

For all strains of S. aureus and E. coli, the action of silver nanoparticles was found to be superior. Strain-specific variation for S. aureus was negligible, while some strain-specific variation was observed for E. coli. A higher sensitivity, as shown with B. subtilis, may be attributed to more amine and carboxyl groups (in comparison to other species) on the cell surface; these groups having a greater affinity for copper [57]. Released copper ions within the cell may then disrupt nucleic acid and key enzymes [58]. In theory, a combination of silver and copper nanoparticles may give rise to a more complete bactericidal effect, especially against a mixed population of bacteria. Indeed, the studies of Ren et al.

CuO has attracted particular attention because it is the simplest member of the family of copper compounds and exhibits a range of potentially useful physical properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, electron correlation effects, and spin dynamics [63], [64]. Copper oxide is relatively cheap, easily mixed with polarized liquids (i.e., water) and polymers, and relatively stable in terms of both chemical and physical properties. Highly ionic nanoparticulate metal oxides, such as CuO, may be particularly valuable antimicrobial agents as they can be prepared with extremely high surface areas and unusual crystal morphologies [61].",

CuO nanoparticles in suspension showed activity against a range of bacterial pathogens, including MRSA and E. coli, with MBCs ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 mg/mL. The MIC and MBC of CuO nanoparticles against P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were determined by Vargas-Reus et al. [41]. They found that the MIC for CuO ranged from 250 to 500 \u03bcg/mL, and the MBC ranged from 250 to 2500 \u03bcg/mL, which are significantly higher when compared to silver. As with silver, studies of CuO nanoparticles incorporated into polymers suggest that release of ions may be required for optimum killing [40]. Incorporation of nano-CuO into porous elastomeric polyurethane films has demonstrated potential for a number of applications. Studies have shown this approach to be effective against MRSA within 4 hours of contact [65].",

Leakage of intracellular contents and a degree of membrane disorganization were observed. Using Raman spectroscopy the intensities of lipid and protein bands were shown to increase after exposure to nZnO, whereas no significant change to nucleic acid was indicated.

TiO2 is widely used in a number of applications, as a powder and increasingly in a nanoparticulate form, and is generally considered to be nontoxic at the concentrations normally employed. The antimicrobial properties of TiO2 are related to its crystal structure, shape, and size [78]. However, there are concerns that nanotitanium oxide may present a hazard to health through inflammation as generated by the release of IL-1\u03b1 [79]. The anatase form of nano-TiO2 and UV light excitation are required to ensure maximum antimicrobial activity. TiO2 photocatalysis is able to promote the peroxidation of the polyunsaturated phospholipid component of the microbial lipid membrane, induce loss of respiratory activity, and elicit cell death [80]. The study of Tsuang et al. [81] demonstrated TiO2-mediated photocatalytic and bactericidal activities against obligate aerobes (P. aeruginosa), facultative anaerobes (S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus hirae) and obligate anaerobes (Bacteroides fragilis).

Second, electrostatic interactions between SPIONs and bacterial cell membranes can result in physical damage to the cell membrane, which ultimately leads to bacterial death [87].

Analysis of plaque samples demonstrated CPP\u2013ACP nanocomplexes to be localized in plaque on the surface of bacterial cells and essentially confirm the studies by Rose [118], [119], who demonstrated tight binding to S. mutans and the intercellular plaque matrix to provide a calcium ion reservoir.

This approach is now being utilized within the clinical setting in some countries. The killing of microorganisms with light depends upon cytotoxic singlet oxygen and free-radical generation by the excitation of a photoactivatable agent or sensitizer. The result of excitation is that the sensitizer moves from an electronic ground state to a triplet state, which then interacts with microbial components to generate cytotoxic species [121]. One of the advantages of light-activated killing is that the resistance to action of singlet oxygen is unlikely to become widespread in comparison to that experienced with more traditional chemical antimicrobial agents. A sensitizer ideally should absorb light at red to near-infrared wavelengths because these wavelengths are able to penetrate more. The most commonly tested sensitizers on bacteria have been tricyclic dyes (e.g., methylene blue, erythrosine), tetrapyrroles (e.g., porphyrins), and furocoumarins (e.g., psoralen). The use of nanoparticles within this area is now under investigation. For example, a complex of biodegradable and biocompatible poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and colloidal gold nanoparticles, loaded with methylene blue and exposed to red light at 665 nm, has been tested against planktonic E. faecalis and in experimentally infected root canals [122]. In theory, gold nanoparticle conjugates should have improved binding and cell wall penetration properties, and so should deliver a higher concentration of photoactive molecules. It remains to be fully established whether such conjugates will show an increased antibacterial activity when compared to more conventional treatments.",

The photosensitizer erythrosine has an advantage over other dyes because it is currently used in dentistry to visualize dental plaque in vivo, and so its lack of toxicity in the host is well established. For use in periodontitis, the dye needs to be applied subgingivally prior to fiberoptic laser light activation. However, when disease is present, the periodontal site has a marked flow of GCF into the pocket, and most photosensitizers lose some activity in the presence of extraneous protein. Also, some have virtually no effect in the presence of saliva and other body fluids. This is because the agents complex with proteins and host cells in the GCF and effectively compete for binding to bacteria.

BG nanoparticles generally have very good biocompatibility. In vitro investigations with MG-63 osteoblast-like cells reveal a high cyto-compatibility of nanoscale BG particles [127]. In comparison to other metals, silver is less toxic to human cells, and is only ever used at very low concentrations in vivo [27]. For example, silver nanoparticles have been shown to inhibit Candida spp. at a concentration of 0.2 \u03bcg/mL, which is markedly less than the concentration (30 \u03bcg/mL) required to demonstrate a toxic effect against human fibroblasts [128]. Besides, it has been reported that by incorporating AgNPs into titanium implant material, not only the antibacterial ability of the implant is enhanced, but also the surface remains biocompatible [129]. Similarly, nZnO has been shown to possess good biocompatibility. Memarzadeh et al. studied the cytotoxicity of nZnO against UMR-106 and MG-63 cells. The results indicated that UMR-106 cells exposed to nZnO supernatants showed minimal toxicity. Similarly, MG-63 cells cultured on nZnO substrates did not show release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 cytokines [74].",

The contribution of surface charge to both mammalian and microbial interactions has been illustrated using surfactant-coated nanoparticles [132]. Antiadherent and antifungal effects were shown using buccal epithelial cells treated with nondrug-loaded poly(ethylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were prepared using emulsion polymerization and stabilized with cationic, anionic, or nonionic surfactants. Cationic surfactants, for example, cetrimide, which are known antimicrobial agents, were the most effective in reducing C. albicans blastospore adhesion, and showed a growth-inhibitory and biocidal effect against the yeast. Production of nanoparticles with an anionic surfactant gave lower yields and wide particle size distributions. No evidence of killing against C. albicans was shown. Nonionic surfactant-coated nanoparticles produced intermediate kill rates. These studies clearly demonstrate the importance of surface charge on the nanoparticle surface. It is suggested that the buccal epithelium could possibly be treated using polymeric-type nanoparticles in a mouthwash-type formulation; in theory this would prime the potential target cells against adhesion and infection.",

It was shown that the main independent particle variables which determine compatibility are size, surface charge, and dispersibility (particularly the effect of hydrophobicity). Cationic particles or particles with a high surface reactivity are more likely to be toxic (to both eukaryotes and prokaryotes). Larger, more hydrophobic or poorly dispersed particles, which would be rapidly removed by the reticuloendothelial system, were shown to be less toxic. Karlsson et al. [62] have shown that metal oxide nanoparticles are more toxic than at first envisaged at concentrations down to 40 \u03bcg/mL and show a high variation as regards different nanoparticle species to cause cytotoxicity, DNA damage, and oxidative DNA lesions. Toxic effects on cultured cells were assessed using trypan blue staining, the comet assay to measure DNA damage, and an oxidation-sensitive fluoroprobe to quantify the production of reactive oxygen species [62]. Copper oxide was found to be the most toxic and therefore may pose the greatest health risk. Nanoparticulate ZnO and TiO2, both ingredients in sunscreens and cosmetics, also showed significant cytotoxic and DNA-damaging effects. The potential mechanisms of toxicity for these and other selected nanoparticles are listed in Table 10.1\n.",

The specific impact of surface capping, size scale, and aspect ratio of ZnO particles upon antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity have been investigated [76]. PEG-capped ZnO nanoparticles demonstrated an increase in antimicrobial efficacy with a reduction in particle size. Again, Gram-negative bacteria were more affected than Gram-positive, which suggests that a membrane damage mechanism of action rather than one involving the production of reactive oxygen species is of overriding significance. PEG-capped nanoparticles were found to be highly toxic to human cells with a very low concentration (at 100 \u03bcM) threshold for cytotoxic action, whereas the concentration for antibacterial activity was 50 times greater (at 5 mM). It is hypothesized that the toxicity to eukaryotic cells is related to nanoparticle-enhanced apoptosis by up-regulation of the Fas ligand on the cell membrane [76].",
