Concerns are now growing about the effects of these strategies on the economy and the associated effects on social determinants of health. Governments and communities may be willing to spend to counter the immediate effects of the crisis on social determinants of health, but the opportunity costs of such spending will be significant forgone benefits in the future, associated with reduced access to healthcare and reduced spending to address social determinants of health.",

Given the scale of the current and expected job losses, I detect a stronger reaction in the current climate. Almost everyone knows someone who has become unemployed, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy is consistently in the news. People remaining in employment are experiencing negative externalities from the large-scale increase in unemployment. The utility function of individuals who remain employed is being reduced by the effects of the pandemic on the people who have become unemployed.",

In addition to the direct effect of induced constraints on consumption limiting our ability to spend our way out of the economic crisis, constrained consumption also further diminishes the marginal utility of income [4]. This means that the disutility of paying additional income tax during the COVID-19 crisis is reduced relative to the disutility of paying more income tax in normal times.",
