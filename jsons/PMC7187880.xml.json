Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 cases and subsequent infection control and public health containment measures are essential for healthcare facilities and the community. One of the World Health Organization\u2019s key tenets to control the pandemic is to build and maintain public health capacity, including detection of symptomatic cases, testing of suspect cases within 24 hours of specimen collection, self-isolation of confirmed cases and contact tracing for confirmed COVID-19 cases [1]. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial component of this process, and as an emerging virus, there has been an ongoing evolution of diagnostic molecular testing including an array of laboratory developed tests and commercial testing platforms with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) [2].",

Utilization of these platforms enabled high-volume and automated throughput, as well as the ability to process specimens other than nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs using the Lightmix\u00ae Kit. On average, the expected laboratory testing time on these platforms is approximately 3.5 hours. A rapid molecular assay, which provides a result in \u223c45 minutes, for SARS-CoV-2, Xpert\u00ae Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) also recently received FDA EUA.

As the ability of molecular assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection can be limited by low amounts of viral RNA (e.g. early or late in COVID-19 disease), we evaluated commercial assays using samples with low levels of viral RNA [Cycle threshold (Ct) \u226530].

Compared to previously published data indicating >99% concordance, overall agreement was lower in our study as we aimed to assess challenging diagnostic samples with low levels of viral RNA [3,4]. Interestingly, on review of the Xpert\u00ae results for the discordant signals, endpoint values >5 samples were detected in 40% (2/5) of the samples. Based on our previous study on endpoint values with Xpert\u00ae Flu/RSV, our laboratory would test negative samples with endpoint values >5 with a second assay due to the concern for a low level viral load [5]. Including those two samples with endpoint values >5 (Sample 1 and 2, Table 1), concordance between the assays would have been 92%. Importantly, in the absence of endpoint value review and further testing, a discordance rate of 23% may result in laboratories that rely exclusively on the Xpert\u00ae assay to report negative results in samples harboring low levels of viral RNA. With expansion of testing to identify pre-symptomatic patients, the number of specimens falling into this low level viral RNA range may be expected to increase, and repeat testing of negative Xpert\u00ae results may be indicated with a secondary method.",

For patients presenting early, studies on viral dynamics suggest that they may have a low burden of disease [6]. As a potentially missed diagnosis, these patients can serve as ongoing reservoirs for transmission within the community or healthcare facility [7]. For diagnosed COVID-19 patients, in situations where a test-based strategy is preferred for discontinuation of infection control precautions, identification of these patients with low viral loads is essential to avoid premature discontinuation [8]. Although detection of viral RNA by PCR may not correlate with live transmissible virus [6], a conservative approach to discontinuing transmission-based precautions may be indicated, given this strategy is primarily used for high-risk populations such as inpatients, severely immunocompromised patients, or long-term care facility residents.",

In addition, we were unable to test all samples on the three assays, using the cobas\u00ae or Lightmix\u00ae assays as the reference Ct in which to test the Xpert\u00ae. However, a prospective comparison of 502 nasopharyngeal swabs between the cobas\u00ae and Lightmix\u00ae reported 99.6% overall agreement and good correlation (r\u00b2 = 0.96) between Ct [4].
